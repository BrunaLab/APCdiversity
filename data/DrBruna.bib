abstract={When manufacturing crystalline candies, increase of the solidification rate is important to improve the quality of productivity. The effect of outer seed crystal specifications and stirring period in processing for food engineering on the solidification rate of molten sugar was investigated based on the concept of solid-state transformation of sugar melt crystallization. From experiments using outer seed crystals, we found that the solidification rate depended on the surface of the seed crystals and the stirring period before molten sugar was cast. This dependence was caused by shear nucleation where microcrystal fragments are generated by an attrition process based on shear force from the crystal surface. Without the proposed treatment, solidification required 106.0 h. However, we succeeded in increasing the solidification rate to 1.0 h, which is approximately 106 times faster. Thus, we proposed an operational strategy to improve the quality of productivity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We studied a biotechnological desulfurization process for removal of toxic hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from sour gas. The process consists of two steps: i) Selective absorption of H2S into a (bi)carbonate solution in the absorber column and ii) conversion of sulfide to sulfur by sulfide oxidizing bacteria (SOB) in the aerated bioreactor. In previous studies, several physico-chemical factors were assessed to explain the observed enhancement of H2S absorption in the absorber, but a full explanation was not provided. We investigated the relation between the metabolic activity of SOB and the enhancement factor. Two continuous experiments on pilot-scale were performed to determine H2S absorption efficiencies at different temperatures and biomass concentrations. The absorption efficiency improved at increasing temperatures, i.e. H2S concentration in the treated gas decreased from 715 ± 265 ppmv at 25.4 °C to 69 ± 25 ppmv at 39.4 °C. The opposite trend is expected when H2S absorption is solely determined by physico-chemical factors. Furthermore, increasing biomass concentrations to the absorber also resulted in decreased H2S concentrations in the treated gas, from approximately 6000 ppmv without biomass to 1664 ± 126 ppmv at 44 mg N/L. From our studies it can be concluded that SOB activity enhances H2S absorption and leads to increased H2S removal efficiencies in biotechnological gas desulfurization. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The need to control eutrophication in water bodies and the risk of supply shortage of phosphate rock have motivated the search for treatment techniques able to sequester and recover P from wastewaters. Current techniques can recover phosphate from highly loaded aqueous media, but it is increasingly important to develop economically attractive solutions for low concentration effluents. Adsorption can be highly selective and efficient for phosphate uptake and recovery from water and wastewater, which can act as secondary sources of phosphorus. This review gathers the data reported in the literature about phosphate removal from water through adsorption and subsequent recovery through desorption or direct use of the phosphorus-loaded adsorbent as a fertilizer. Metal (e.g. Al, Ca, Ce, Fe, La, Mg, Mn, Zn, Zr) hydroxides/oxides provide excellent adsorption capacities of phosphate, in addition to other advantages such as fast kinetics and good selectivity. These compounds have been incorporated into zeolites, mesoporous silica, activated carbon, biochar, and bio-derived materials, to enhance their adsorption capacities. Significant advances have been made in engineered materials, including magnetic and granular adsorbents. Literature reports other valuable attempts to upscale the process including pilot-scale experiments, application in fixed-bed columns and to real wastewaters. Further studies are necessary to overcome some limitations still observed. Future work should give more attention to phosphorus recovery from the eluates and to the direct use of P-loaded adsorbents. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The reactions of different lipid-derived reactive carbonyls with ammonia-producing compounds were studied to investigate the formation of pyridines in foods. 2-Alkyl, 3-alkyl-, and 2,5-dialkylpyiridines were produced by oligomerization of short-chain aldehydes in the presence of ammonia. Thus, acetaldehyde/crotonaldehyde mixtures and 2,4-alkadienals were the main responsible for the formation of 2-alkylpyridines; acrolein or 2,4-alkadienals were needed for the formation of 3-alkylpyridines; and 2-alkenals were responsible for the formation of 2,5-dialkylpyridines. On the contrary, 2,6-dialkylpyridines were produced by cyclization of unsaturated ketones. Reactions pathways for formation of these pyridines are proposed, and confirmed by isotopic labelling experiments. Aldehydes and ketones required for their formation are produced in the course of lipid oxidation. Therefore, pyridine formation seems to be an additional consequence of the lipid oxidation pathway. This new knowledge can employed for the optimization of reactions to achieve the desired targeted flavor generation during food processing. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Recombinant protein production in the baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) has emerged as a system of choice for the production of recombinant human proteins for R&D purposes. Scale-up protein production in insect cells past the one or two liter volume generally utilizes disposable cellbag bioreactors that provide a means to scale to the 5-25L range in a single vessel. However, cellbags can be expensive and their use requires capital investment in dedicated rocker platforms and their associated air pumps and exhaust heaters. Additional equipment, such as tube welders and liquid pumps are often also deployed for the sterile transfer of media outside of a biosafety cabinet. Herein it is reported that Sf9, Sf21 and High Five insect cells demonstrate normal growth characteristics when cultured at the 2.5 L level in 3 L Erlenmeyer flasks, or at the 4.5 L level in 5 L Erlenmeyer flasks in standard laboratory shakers. In addition, a direct comparison of the expression levels of four separate proteins at the 4.5 L scale in 5 L flasks versus those at the 5 L scale in 10 L cellbags demonstrates that protein production is equal to, or slightly better, in the flasks versus the cellbags. The adoption of high-volume shake flasks for routine recombinant protein production in insect cells has a number of advantages over disposable bioreactors in terms of ease of use, and equipment and disposables costs. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Peracetic acid (PAA) is an oxidizer widely used for the sterilization of equipment in hospitals, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industries and also for water and wastewater disinfection. Even with its increasing applications, there have been no previous theoretical studies that explain the experimental results based on its molecular behavior. In this context, this work used calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) combined with experimental results to elucidate the decomposition mechanisms of PAA for predicting its stability and the possible products generated from its decomposition. The results obtained showed that the protonation of PAA promoted its spontaneous decomposition in acetic acid and molecular oxygen. The hydrolysis mechanism of PAA in acidic medium indicated that the low energy difference involved in the mechanism's stages is responsible for the equilibrium between PAA and H2O2. The structural and electronic comparison of PAA with H2O2 showed that the O–O bond length of PAA is longer than that of H2O2 and is also weaker, therefore may demonstrate greater efficiency in advanced oxidative processes by photocatalysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The present research investigates the long term inhibition of enzymatic browning by inactivating the polyphenol oxidase (PPO) of apricot, using combinations of plant proteases and ascorbic acid (AA). The selected proteases were able to inactivate PPO at pH 4.5, with the degree of inactivation proportional to incubation time and protease concentration. Papain was the most effective protease, with 50 μg completely inactivating PPO in less than one hour. AA prevented browning reactions that occur before or during PPO inactivation by protease. The combinations of AA/proteases were highly effective in vitro, where 2 mM AA/500 μg proteases inhibited PPO activity completely over 24 h. The combination of AA/proteases was also effective in vivo, as treated apricot purees preserved their color (p < 0.0001, compared to untreated samples after 10 days of storage). The results demonstrate that AA/proteases combinations constitute a promising practical anti-browning method with feasible application in the food industry. © 2019},

Precipitation inter-comparisons have been done between different resolution datasets (e.g. GCMs, RCMs, NEX-GDDP and observed precipitation) to explore precipitation ambiguity (or variabilities) and their applicability in a long-term period (1951–2100) across the India. The observed gridded precipitation (1951–2005) and NEX-GDDP datasets (2006–2100) have been used as a reference data-sets to assess the accuracy of GCMs and RCMs. Variations in precipitation trends have been explored at each grid scale utilizing non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and statistical p-value test at 95% confidence interval. Inter-comparison analysis results showed that a significant diversity existed in the precipitation amounts among all climate model datasets, which have been non-uniformly distributed across the India. Results from model inter-comparisons, percentage of change analysis and Q-Q analysis performed between GCMs versus observed precipitation, RCM versus observed precipitation, GCMs versus RCMs and RCMs versus NEX-GDDP models showed a high variability existed in precipitation amount across the India during1951–2100. In opposite, at several locations a good association in precipitation between different resolution datasets was observed. GCMs based precipitation was underestimated and RCMs showed overestimation across the India. Overall, RCMs based rainfalls have found comparatively closer to observed and NEX-GDDP based rainfalls, yet RCMs have highly overestimated in several regions of India. Seasonal trends uncertainty estimation showed a better correlation in precipitation between NEX-GDDP and RCMs, especially during monsoon and pre-monsoon season. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as refrigerant is driven by the need to phase down the traditional synthetic refrigerant so as to mitigate the warming climate. In this study, the thermal performance of a two-stage compression transcritical CO2 refrigeration system with R290 mechanical subcooling unit is conducted. The goal is to obtain the maximum coefficient of performance (COP) of five different mechanical subcooling systems under the optimal subcooling temperature and compressor discharge pressure. The two-throttling and two-stage compression high-pressure mechanical subcooling system is found to have a higher COP. When the evaporation temperature is −30 °C, the COP of the two-throttling and two-stage compression high-pressure mechanical subcooling system is improved by 76.74%. The COP of the two-throttling and two-stage compression high-pressure mechanical subcooling system is 1.52 at an ambient temperature of 40 °C, which is 21.87% higher than that of the two-throttling and two-stage compression low-pressure mechanical subcooling system. The power consumption ratio of one-throttling and two-stage compression low-pressure mechanical subcooling system is significantly higher than that of other systems. From a comprehensive analysis of the proposed four systems, the two-throttling and two-stage compression high-pressure mechanical subcooling system has the best performance over all other systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Brucellosis in swine is caused by Brucella suis, a bacterial infection of nearly worldwide distribution. Brucella suis is also transmissible to humans, dogs and cattle and is considered a reemerging disease of public health concern. To date, there is no effective vaccine for swine. This prompted us to investigate the potential use of the commercially available vaccine for cattle or the live attenuated vaccine candidate S19ΔvjbR. As the first step, we sought to study the safety of the vaccine candidates when administered in pregnant sows, since one of the major drawbacks associated with vaccination using Live Attenuated Vaccines (LAV) is the induction of abortions when administered in pregnant animals. Fifteen pregnant gilts at mid-gestation were divided into four groups and subsequently vaccinated subcutaneously using different formulations containing 2.0 ± 0.508 × 109 CFU of either S19 or S19ΔvjbR. Vaccination in pregnant animals with the vaccine candidates did not induce abortion, stillbirths or a reduction in litter size. Multiple tissues in the gilts and piglets were examined at the time of delivery to assess bacterial colonization and histopathological changes. There was no evidence of vaccine persistence in the gilts or bacterial colonization in the fetuses. Altogether, these data suggest that both vaccine candidates are safe for use in pregnant swine. Analysis of the humoral responses, specifically anti-Brucella IgG levels measured in serum, demonstrated a robust response induced by either vaccine, but of shorter duration (4–6 weeks post-inoculation) compared to that observed in cattle or experimentally infected mice. Such a transient humoral response may prove to be beneficial in cases where the vaccine is used in eradication campaigns and in the differentiation of vaccinated from infected animals. This study provides evidence to support future efficacy studies of both vaccine candidates in swine. © 2019},

abstract={Introduction: Influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated in Europe in 2016–17. In 2017–18 A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses co-circulated. The A(H3N2) vaccine component was the same in both seasons; while the A(H1N1)pdm09 component changed in 2017–18. In both seasons, vaccine seed A(H3N2) viruses developed adaptations/alterations during propagation in eggs, impacting antigenicity. Methods: We used the test-negative design in a multicentre primary care case-control study in 12 European countries to measure 2016–17 and 2017–18 influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) against laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) overall and by age group. Results: During the 2017–18 season, the overall VE against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was 59% (95% CI: 47–69). Among those aged 0–14, 15–64 and ≥65 years, VE against A(H1N1)pdm09 was 64% (95% CI: 37–79), 50% (95% CI: 28–66) and 66% (95% CI: 42–80), respectively. Overall VE against influenza A(H3N2) was 28% (95% CI: 17–38) in 2016–17 and 13% (95% CI: −15 to 34) in 2017–18. Among 0–14-year-olds VE against A(H3N2) was 28% (95%CI: −10 to 53) and 29% (95% CI: −87 to 73), among 15–64-year-olds 34% (95% CI: 18–46) and 33% (95% CI: −3 to 56) and among those aged ≥65 years 15% (95% CI: −10 to 34) and −9% (95% CI: −74 to 32) in 2016–17 and 2017–18, respectively. Conclusions: Our study suggests the new A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine component conferred good protection against circulating strains, while VE against A(H3N2) was <35% in 2016–17 and 2017–18. The egg propagation derived antigenic mismatch of the vaccine seed virus with circulating strains may have contributed to this low effectiveness. A(H3N2) seed viruses for vaccines in subsequent seasons may be subject to the same adaptations; in years with lower than expected VE, recommendations of preventive measures other than vaccination should be given in a timely manner. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objectives: HPV vaccination rates in the United States lag behind other developed countries. Educational interventions are primarily directed at patients and parents rather than healthcare providers (HCPs), despite evidence that provider recommendation is a key determinant of vaccine uptake. The objectives for this review are to synthesize the available evidence related to the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of HCPs surrounding HPV vaccination, to summarize provider-specific educational interventions which have been evaluated, and to review existing provider-specific educational resources from national organizations and whether they align with the gaps identified. Methods: A systematic search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and ERIC with MeSH terms human papillomavirus, vaccine, education, workshop, training, knowledge, attitude, belief, intention, and healthcare provider. Full text articles were obtained for studies that described the knowledge and attitudes of providers and/or impact of educational interventions. Data extraction was performed by four independent reviewers. Websites of American organizations with an interest in HPV vaccination were manually searched for provider resources. Results: 1066 publications were identified, and 98 articles were fully reviewed with 40 ultimately included. Providers’ knowledge on HPV was generally low with a correspondingly low vaccine recommendation rate. Provider-specific education (e.g., didactic session and communication training) with complimentary interventions demonstrated increased knowledge and vaccine series initiation and completion. Themes identified in descriptive studies highlighted providers’ lack of general HPV and vaccine knowledge, low self-confidence in counselling and addressing parental concerns, and discomfort in discussing sexual issues related to vaccination. Many American organizations have provider-specific resources; however, the effectiveness of these materials has not been established. Conclusions: HPV knowledge among providers remains low. Educational interventions to improve knowledge and communication appear to be effective. A breadth of resources from national organizations are available but their efficacy and level of utilization is largely unknown. Coordinated efforts are needed to evaluate provider-specific educational resources to improve vaccine uptake in the US. © 2019},

abstract={Pladienolide B is a potent cancer cell growth inhibitor that targets the SF3b1 subunit of the spliceosome. There is considerable interest in the compound as a tool to study SF3b1 function in cancer. However, so far little information is available on the molecular mechanism of SF3b1 eliciting apoptosis in cancer cells. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism of SF3b1 eliciting apoptosis in human cervical carcinoma cells. We demonstrated that inhibition of SF3b1 by pladienolide B inhibited proliferation of HeLa cells at low nanomolar concentrations in a dose- and time-dependent manner. It also induced G2/M phase arrest and significant rise of apoptotic cells. Moreover, it is indicated that inhibition of SF3b1 by pladienolide B induced Tap73/ΔNp73 expression and consequently down-regulated Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cytochrome c release and caspase-3 expression. Thus, our results showed that SF3b1 plays a pivotal role in cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, and p73 splicing in human cervical carcinoma cells, suggesting that SF3b1 could be used as a potential candidate for cervical cancer therapy. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The KASA system is designed to: 1) capture and manage knowledge during the lifecycle of a drug product; 2) establish rules and algorithms for risk assessment, control, and communication; 3) perform computer-aided analyses of applications to compare regulatory standards and quality risks across applications and facilities; and 4) provide a structured assessment that minimizes text-based narratives and summarization of provided information. When fully developed and implemented, KASA will enrich the effectiveness, efficiency, and consistency of regulatory quality oversight through lifecycle management of products and facilities, and information sharing in a standardized and structured format. Ultimately, KASA will advance FDA's focus on pharmaceutical quality, the foundation for ensuring the safety and efficacy of drugs. © 2019},

abstract={In this study, a method is described to determine the monolayer loading capacity (MLC) of the drugs naproxen and ibuprofen, both having high recrystallization tendencies, in mesoporous silica (MS), a well known carrier that is able to stabilize the amorphous form of a drug. The stabilization has been suggested to be due to direct absorption of the drug molecules onto the MS surface, i.e. the drug monolayer. In addition, drug that is not in direct contact with MS surface can fill the pores up to its pore filling capacity (PFC) and is potentially stabilized by confinement due to the pore size being smaller than a crystal nuclei. For drugs with high recrystallization tendencies, any drug outside the pores crystallizes due to its poor physical stability. The drug monolayer does not contribute to the glass transition temperature (Tg) in the DSC, however, the confined amorphous drug above MLC has a Tg and the heat capacity (ΔCp) over the Tg increases with an increasing fraction of confined amorphous drug. Hence, several drug loading values above the MLC were investigated towards the presence of a Tg and ΔCp using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). A linear correlation between the amount of confined amorphous drug and its ΔCp was identified for the mixtures between the MLC and PFC. By subsequent extrapolation to zero ΔCp the experimental MLC could be determined. Using theoretical density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD), the binding energies for the monolayer suggested that the monolayer in fact is thermodynamically more favorable than the crystalline form, whereas the confined amorphous form is thermodynamically less favorable. Consequently, a physical stability study showed that the confined amorphous drugs above the MLC were thermodynamically unstable and consequently flowing out of the pores in order to crystallize, whereas the monolayer remained physically stable. © 2019},

abstract={The mechanical properties of a new glass-ceramic similar to basalt glass-ceramics have been determined. This new glass-ceramic is similar to those obtained from basalts and it is a resulting material from the vitrification of a highly contaminated sludge rich in hexavalent chromium (Cr6+). A formulated mixture between this industrial waste and silica-based additives was achieved within the CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 system. The Cr6+ can be fully reduced to Cr3+ with high chemical and mechanical stability, and the resulting material is stable for the environment. The Weibull modulus of flexural strength was m = 5.7, corresponding to a relatively low value, indicating that the breakage is due to a variable number of types of cracks. In any case, the average flexural strength of this material (258 MPa) can be considered as a relative high value when compared with the values of more traditional glass-ceramics. © 2019},

abstract={The present study investigated particle size-induced segregation during die filling of binary pharmaceutical blends, consisting of fine and coarse particles in various fractions. Coarse fraction was made of milled and sieved acetylsalicylic acid, whereas the fine fraction was mannitol. The die filling process was carried out in gravity filling and suction filling. The segregation was assessed through determination of the coarse component concentration using UV–Visible spectrophotometry. The obtained values of concentration, determined for ten units of identical volume inside the die, were used to calculate the segregation index (SI), which was an indicator of uniformity of the powder blend deposited into the die. It was found that high segregation tendency was generally observed during gravity filling at a low velocity, due to the effect of air drag, and during gravity filling at a high velocity, as it was carried out through three consecutive filling steps. The lowest segregation tendency was generally observed during suction filling at a low velocity. The horizontal segregation was mostly observed in the top layers of the die, due to mainly two mechanisms: coarse particles cascading down the heap formed by the powder in the final steps of die filling, which produces higher coarse concentration at the near side of the die, observed at low coarse concentration; or coarse particle cascading down the top surface of the flowing powder stream into the die, which increases the coarse concentration at the far end of the die. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={This work demonstrates the application of state-of-the-art modeling techniques in pharmaceutical manufacturing for fluid bed granulation at varying scales to successfully predict process conditions and ultimately replace experiments during a technology transfer of five products. We describe a mathematical model able to simulate the time-dependent moisture profile in a fluid bed granulation process. The applicability of this model is then demonstrated by calibrating and validating it over a range of operating conditions, manufacturing scales, and formulations. The inherent capability of the moisture profile to serve as a simple, scale-independent surrogate is shown by the large number of successful scale-ups and transfers. A methodology to use this ‘digital twin’ to systematically explore the effects of uncertainty inherent in the process input and model parameter spaces and their impact on the process outputs is described. Two case studies exemplifying the utilization of the model in industrial practice to assess process robustness are provided. Lastly, a pathway to leverage model results to establish proven acceptable ranges for individual parameters is outlined. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The poor pharmacokinetic profile and off-target adverse effects provide a strong incentive to develop drug delivery systems for bortezomib. In the past, liposomal encapsulation has been proven to improve the therapeutic index of a variety of anti-neoplastic therapeutics. Here, we developed and characterized liposomal bortezomib formulations in order to find the most optimal loading conditions. Polyols were used to entrap bortezomib inside the liposomes as boronate ester via a remote loading strategy. Effect of various polyols, incubation duration, temperature, and total lipid concentration on loading efficiency was examined. Moreover, the effect of drug/lipid ratio on the release kinetics was studied. Loading efficiency was maximal when using meglumine plus mannitol as entrapping agents. Loading at room temperature was better than at 60 °C and loading efficiency was increased with increasing total lipid concentrations. There was a positive correlation between drug/lipid ratio and released amount of bortezomib. In vitro release kinetics in HBS and human plasma showed time dependent release. In HBS, at 4 °C, only 20% of the drug was released in three weeks, whereas at 37 °C 85% of the drug was released in 24 h. In human plasma, 5% of the drug retained after 24 h indicating faster release. Taken together, the most favorable liposomal formulation of bortezomib should be further exploited to study in vitro and in vivo efficacy performance. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The granule size distribution is a critical quality attribute of granules. It has a great impact on further packaging or processing. Due to increasing interest in continuous manufacturing techniques, it is of high interest to develop an in-line or on-line tool to monitor the granule size distribution. However, development of an in-line measurement tool for granule size distribution was challenging since large throughput and inhomogeneous product stream are limiting factors for current particle size analyzers. In this study, continuous sampling was tested in conjunction to a continuous on-line method of size determination using dynamic image analysis. A rotating tube sample divider was used to split previously compacted material in representative samples at different ratios and the sample was directly conveyed to the particle size analyzer where the granule size distribution was determined. The method was tested for different granule sizes to determine limits of detection and its ability to detect these changes immediately, as this enables real-time monitoring of the process. This research is the base for development of control tools concerning the granule size distributions for continuous granulation processes. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The objective of this study was to evaluate in vitro and in vivo drug release from in situ forming gels prepared with poloxamer 338 (P338) and/or 407 (P407) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)/water mixtures for the model compound bedaquiline fumarate salt. The impact of total poloxamer concentration (20%–25% (w/w)), P338/P407 ratio (100/0%–0/100% (w/w)) and NMP/water ratio (0/100%–25/75% (v/v)) on gel point temperature (GPT) was investigated via a design of experiments (DoE), showing that GPT decreased mainly with increasing poloxamer concentration and decreasing P338/P407 ratio, while the relation with NMP/water ratio was more complex resulting in a flexion. Based on the DoE, four formulations with 10 mg/g bedaquiline fumarate salt, a fixed NMP/water ratio of 25/75% (v/v) and varying total poloxamer concentration and P338/P407 ratio were selected for evaluation of gel erosion in vitro. The fastest eroding formulation had the lowest total poloxamer concentration (20% (w/w)) and the lowest P338/P407 ratio (20.4/79.6% (w/w)), while the formulation with the highest total poloxamer concentration (23.5% (w/w)) and highest P338/P407 ratio (100/0% (w/w)) showed the lowest gel erosion rate. These fast and slow eroding formulations showed a similar trend for in vitro drug release and in vivo pharmacokinetics after intramuscular (IM) injection in rats. In vivo tmax of the IM administered poloxamer in situ forming gels was about 6 h and a short-term sustained drug release was observed in vivo in rats up to 24 h after dosing, similar to a solution of bedaquiline fumarate salt in polyethylene glycol (PEG400)/water. In conclusion, IM administration of the evaluated poloxamer in situ forming gels may be useful for drugs that require a short-term sustained release, but is not able to extend drug release rates up to weeks or months. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={In this study, the influence of the mesoporous silica (MS) textural properties (surface area, pore diameter, and pore volume) on drug loading capacity (monomolecular loading capacity and pore filling capacity) was investigated theoretically and experimentally using a thermoanalytical method. The loading capacities of three model drugs (celecoxib, cinnarizine, and paracetamol) were determined in five different MS grades of Sylysia® with identical chemical composition, but varying surface area, pore diameter and pore volume. The experimentally determined loading capacities were compared to theoretical loading capacities, calculated based on the surface area and amorphous density of the drugs, and the surface area and pore volume of the MS. The findings of the study showed that the monomolecular loading capacity generally increased with increasing surface area and decreasing pore volume of the MS. However, the MS grade with the highest surface area did not display the highest monomolecular loading capacity for any of the three drugs. This was probably a result of the decreasing pore diameter necessary to accommodate the increasing surface area of the MS i.e., if the pore is smaller than the drug molecule, the drug cannot access the available surface area. For these systems, the amorphous density of the drug and the pore volume of the MS was used to estimate the theoretical pore filling capacity, which was in good agreement with the experimentally determined loading capacity. In conclusion, this study showed that both the pore volume and surface area of the MS will have an influence on the drug loading capacity and that this can be estimated with good accuracy both theoretically and experimentally. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) along with attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were employed to investigate the process of adsorption of propranolol hydrochloride (PPN) onto magnesium aluminium silicate (MAS) and to characterise the MAS-PPN particles formed upon complexation. The composition of MAS was confirmed by infrared (IR) spectroscopy and a calcimeter. The calorimetric results confirmed the binding between PPN and MAS at various pHs and temperatures. The overall change in enthalpy was found to be exothermic with a comparatively small entropic contribution to the total change in Gibbs free energy. These findings suggest that the binding process was enthalpically driven and entropically unfavourable (lower affinity) suggesting hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions dominating the interaction. The variation of pH and temperature did not have a great impact on the thermodynamics of the binding process, as observed from the similarity in enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (ΔS) or Gibbs free energy (ΔG). A slight reduction in the binding affinity (K a ) with varing pH and temperature was however observed. SEM/EDX studies showed the occurrence of changes in the microstructural properties of MAS following complexation which may explain the potential of MAS-PPN complexes for controlled drug release promoting pharmaceutical innovation. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={A face-centered cubic (fcc) polymerized C60 phase has been synthesized at 9.5 GPa and 550 °C. The observed short lattice constant, 13.19 Å, indicates that a three-dimensional (3D) polymer with adjacent C60 molecules covalently bonded was obtained. Possible polymerized structures, with each molecule adopting one of the two standard orientations, have been investigated through density functional theory (DFT). It was found that intermolecular bonds, 56/56 2 + 2 cycloaddition, are formed between molecules with different orientations but no bonds are formed between molecules with the same orientation. The computed bulk moduli for these structures gave values ranging from 88 to 132 GPa. Although the distances between neighboring molecules and the volume per molecule from the models are close to the experimental values, the relaxed structures displayed symmetries lower than cubic, suggesting that the experimental fcc structure is likely disordered or frustrated. © 2019},

abstract={Targeted delivery of therapeutics is an attractive strategy for vascular diseases. Recently, variable domains of heavy-chain-only antibodies (VHHs) have gained momentum as targeting ligands to achieve this. Targeting ligands need adequate conjugation to the preferred delivery platform. When choosing a conjugation method, two features are critical: a fixed and specified stoichiometry and an orientation of the conjugated targeting ligand that preserves its functional binding capacity. We here describe a comparison of popular maleimide-thiol conjugation with state-of-the-art “click chemistry” for conjugating VHHs. First, we demonstrate the modification of VHHs with azide via Sortase A mediated transpeptidation. Subsequently, optimal clicking conditions were found at a temperature of 50 °C, using a 3:1 M ratio of DBCO-PEG:VHH-azide and an incubation time of 18 h. Second, we show that stoichiometry was controllable with click chemistry and produced defined conjugates, whereas maleimide-thiol conjugation resulted in diverse reaction products. In addition, we show that all VHHs – independent of the conjugation method or conjugated residue – still specifically bind their cognate antigen. Yet, VHH's functional binding capacities after click chemistry were at least equal or better than maleimide thiol conjugates. Together these data underline that click chemistry is superior to maleimide-thiol conjugation for conjugating targeting ligands. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The effective treatment of diseases of the inner ear is currently an unmet medical need. Local controlled drug delivery to the cochlea is challenging due to the hidden location, small volume and high sensitivity of this organ. A local intracochlear delivery of drugs would avoid the problems of intratympanic (extracochlear) drug application, but is more invasive. The requirements for such a delivery system include a small size and appropriate flexibility. The delivery device must be rigid enough for surgical handling but also flexible to avoid traumatizing cochlear structures. We developed biodegradable dexamethasone loaded PLGA extrudates for the controlled intracochlear release. In order to achieve the desired flexibility, Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was used as a plasticizer. In addition to the drug release, the extrudates were characterized in vitro by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and texture analysis. Simulation of the pharmacokinetics of the inner ear support the expectation that a constant perilymph drug level is obtained after few hours and retained over several weeks. Ex vivo implantation of the extrudates into a guinea pig cochlea indicate that PEG containing extrudates have the desired balance between mechanical strength and flexibility for direct implantation into the cochlea. The location of the implant was visualized by computer tomography. In summary, we postulate that intracochlear administration of drug releasing biodegradable implants is a new and promising approach to achieve local drug delivery to the cochlea for an extended time. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The aim of this study was to design and evaluate muco-adhesive orally disintegrating tablets manufactured by microwave irradiation and containing polysaccharide. We prepared orally disintegrating tea tablets (ODTTs) containing a 1 w/w% mass fraction of one of five polysaccharides (gum arabic, carrageenan, guar gum, tamarind gum, or pectin) and evaluated the swelling degree, tablet hardness, friability, disintegration time, and adhesive properties. All tablets had a swelling degree of about 1 mm, a hardness of over 13 N, and a friability degree of <1%. Tablets containing gum arabic and tamarind gum had disintegration times of 30 s or less and satisfied requirements as orally disintegrating tablets. This could be attributed to their high void contents, which allowed for water penetration. The adhesive properties and particle retention ratios were highest in ODTTs containing tamarind gum, which was thought to be caused by the rapid disintegration and high viscosity of the tamarind gum itself. When we investigated changing the mass fraction of tamarind gum, we found 1 w/w% was most suitable for rapid disintegration and high adhesiveness. The ODTTs containing 1 w/w% tamarind gum showed significant growth inhibition towards Streptococcus mutans. Therefore, microwave irradiation technology and addition of tamarind gum could be used to manufacture muco-adhesive orally disintegrating tablets for oral care. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={A biophysical lung model was designed to predict inhaled drug deposition in patients with obstructive airway disease, and quantitatively investigate sources of deposition variability. Different mouth-throat anatomies at varying simulated inhalation flows were used to calculate the lung dose of indacaterol/glycopyrronium [IND/GLY] 110/50 µg (QVA149) from the dry-powder inhaler Breezhaler®. Sources of variability in lung dose were studied using computational fluid dynamics, supported by aerosol particle sizing measurements, particle image velocimetry and computed tomography. Anatomical differences in mouth-throat geometries were identified as a major source of inter-subject variability in lung deposition. Lung dose was similar across inhalation flows of 30–120 L/min with a slight drop in calculated delivery at high inspiratory flows. Delivery was relatively unaffected by inhaler inclination angle. The delivered lung dose of the fixed-dose combination IND/GLY matched well with corresponding monotherapy doses. This biophysical model indicates low extra-thoracic drug loss and consistent lung delivery of IND/GLY, independent of inhalation flows. This is an important finding for patients across various ages and lung disease severities. The model provides a quantitative, mechanistic simulation of inhaled therapies that could provide a test system for estimating drug delivery to the lung and complement traditional clinical studies. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={A preclinical porcine model that reliably predicts human food effect of fenofibrate was developed. Fenofibrate was administered to pigs as model compound with a positive food effect. Two different types of fed conditions were explored: a FDA style breakfast and a standard pig pellet feed. In order to assess if complete stomach emptying had been achieved under the employed fasting protocol, the amount of gastric and intestinal content was evaluated post-mortem. In addition, the protocol was designed to evaluate gastric emptying in the pre- and postprandial state using paracetamol as a marker. The study confirmed that micronized fenofibrate displayed a positive food effect with a similar fold difference to humans in FDA style fed state. Post-mortem assessment of stomach and intestinal content confirmed significantly lower content in the fasted compared to the pig pellet fed state. In the case of paracetamol, a delayed gastric emptying in the fed state was not observed, which may suggest that the Magenstrasse phenomena reported in humans, may also occur in landrace pigs. The study demonstrated the utility of a food effect protocol in landrace pigs as a pre-clinical approach to predict human food effects and provided new insights into gastric emptying in pigs. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={A variety of imaging techniques are currently used within the field of pharmaceutics to help understand and determine a wide range of phenomena associated with drug release from hydrophilic matrix tablets. This work for the first time aims at developing an appropriate testing imaging methodology using a surface dissolution imaging instrument (SDI2) for determining the swelling of whole compacts using hypromellose as a model hydrophilic matrix former. The influence of particle morphology (CR and DC grades) and two compressional forces (5 and 15 kN) on the initial swelling behaviour of hypromellose were investigated. The results showed that a lower absorbance of 50 mAu with a wider measurement zone proved successful in determining the edge of the gel layer and growth measurements in real-time with high level of details under flow. Despite the differences in the morphology of the grades of hypromellose tested, it was however discovered that gel growth was statistically similar between them which may be attributed to their similar chemistry. This novel method also highlighted differences in the hydrated polymer's appearance which may have been as a result of differences in porosity and solid fraction. This information is of great importance to a formulator as gel growth plays a crucial role in determining drug release from polymer compacts. © 2019},

abstract={Background/objective: This paper describes evidence-based strategies for the dissemination of empirically supported interventions for infant behavioral sleep problems. Methods: To identify parents' needs, a survey sampled 1022 parents in the Niagara region about use of health resources, tracking occurred of public health nurses' consultations with parents about infant sleep, and nurses obtained sleep workshop evaluation data from 18 parents. A focus group with 10 participants, a survey of Niagara Region Public Health and Emergency Services (NRPH&ES) employees, and consultations with external stakeholders identified gaps in parents' and infants' care and public health nurses' training needs. We developed solutions by creating evidence-based tools and a program for parents and public health nurses. We implemented and disseminated information via sharing tools on the NRPH&ES website, and workshops for community agencies and public health nurses. Results: Seventy childhood educators, support workers, and social and public health professionals attended our community workshop. Twenty-three public health nurses attended our training workshop. In guided discussion, nurses evaluated the workshop as addressing gaps in knowledge and enhancing NRPH&ES interventions to manage infants' behavioral sleep problems. Fifteen parents attended a sleep workshop pilot, with seven parents indicating a preference for follow-up telephone support. Fifty individuals attended our oral presentation at the Ontario Public Health Convention. Conclusions: For next directions, community and other public health agencies want access to our tools and program components. We received a research grant to design, implement, and evaluate sharing tools and program components with community agencies (daycares and childcare centres). © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Changes in tensile properties and the glass transition temperature (Tg) of plasticized polymer films are typically attributed to molecular mobility, often with no empirical data to support such an assertion. Herein solvent cast HPMC films containing varying amounts of PEG, as the plasticizer, were used to assess the dependence of tensile properties and the Tg on glassy state molecular mobility. Molecular mobility (molecular relaxation time and temperature) parameters were determined by Thermally Stimulated Current Spectroscopy (TSC). The tensile properties and Tg of the HPMC films were determined by texture analysis and DSC, respectively. Molecular mobilities detected by TSC were cooperative and occurred at temperatures (Tg′) well below (113 to 127 °C) the bulk Tg. The relaxation times (τ) were 71 ± 1, 46 ± 1, 42 ± 1, 36 ± 1 and 29 ± 1 s for HPMC films containing 0, 6, 8, 11 and 17% (w/w) PEG, respectively. The Tg and glassy state molecular mobility were found to be intimately linked and demonstrated a linear dependence. While tensile strength was found to be linearly related to molecular relaxation time, tensile elongation and elastic modulus exhibited a non-linear dependence on molecular mobility. The data presented in this work demonstrates the complex nature of the relationship between plasticizer content, molecular mobility, Tg and tensile properties for plasticized polymeric films. It highlights the fact that the dependence of the bulk physico-mechanical properties on glassy state molecular mobility, differ greatly. Therefore, empirical characterization of molecular mobility is important to fully understand and predict the thermo-mechanical behavior of plasticized polymer films. This work demonstrates the unique capability of TSC to provide key information relating to molecular mobility and its influence on the bulk properties of materials. Data generated using TSC could prove useful for stability and performance ranking, in addition to the ability to predict materials behavior using data generated at or below typical storage conditions in the pharmaceutical, food, and polymer industries. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={L-ascorbic acid (AA), commonly known as vitamin C, has been widely used in topical formulations for many years as an antioxidant and anti-aging ingredient. However, the physicochemical properties of AA are not optimal for skin uptake and the molecule is also unstable, readily undergoing oxidation on exposure to air. The compound 3-o-ethyl-l-ascorbic acid (EA) has been developed as a stable vitamin C derivative and has been used in topical products. The aims of this work were to conduct a comprehensive characterisation of physicochemical properties of EA as well as to investigate the influence of various neat solvents on EA skin delivery. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to characterise the molecule. The pKa of the compound and the partition coefficient logP(o/w) were experimentally determined. A new HPLC method for analysis of the molecule was also developed and validated. A number of solvents for topical preparations were selected based on their wide use as excipients in topical formulations, their potential to act as skin penetration enhancers and their favourable safety profiles. The solubility and stability of EA was examined. Skin permeation of the molecule in full thickness porcine skin in vitro was investigated using Franz-type diffusion cells. The melting point, log P(o/w) value and pKa value of EA were determined to be 114.39 ± 0.5 °C, −1.07 ± 0.03 and 7.72 ± 0.01 respectively. Skin penetration of EA was evident for the following vehicles 1,2 hexanediol (HEX), glycerol (GLY), propylene glycol (PG), 1,2 pentanediol (1-2P), isopropyl alcohol (IPA), propylene glycol monolaurate (PGML) and propylene glycol monocaprylate (PGMC). Skin uptake but no permeation through the skin was observed for Transcutol® (TC) and dipropylene glycol (DiPG), while no penetration was observed for the solvents 1,5 pentanediol (1-5P) and tripropylene glycol (TriPG). The findings of the permeation experiments confirm the potential of simple formulations to deliver EA to the skin. Studies are ongoing to identify complex vehicles for synergistic enhancement of EA skin penetration. To our knowledge this is the first study to conduct a comprehensive characterization of EA and examine its skin uptake and permeation properties in porcine skin. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={PEGylation is a promising approach to increase the residence time of antibody fragments in the lungs and sustain their therapeutic effects. However, concerns arise as to the potential pulmonary toxicity of antibody fragments conjugated to high molecular weight (HMW) polyethylene glycol (PEG), notably after repeated administrations, and the possibility of PEG accumulation in the lungs. The purpose of this proof-of-concept study is to give insights about the safety of lung administration of a Fab’ anti-IL17A antibody fragment conjugated to two-armed 40 kDa PEG (PEG40). The presence of the PEG40 moiety inside alveolar macrophages remained stable for at least 24 h after intratracheal administration of PEG40-Fab’ to mice. PEG40 was then progressively cleared from alveolar macrophages. Incubation of PEG40 alone with macrophages in vitro did not significantly harm macrophages and did not affect phagocytosis or the production of inflammatory markers. After acute or chronic administration of PEG40-Fab’ to mice, no signs of significant pulmonary toxicity or inflammatory cell accumulation were observed. A vacuolization of alveolar macrophages not associated with any inflammation was noticed when PEG40, PEG40-Fab’, or unPEGylated Fab’ were administered. To conclude this preliminary proof of concept study, acute or repeated pulmonary administrations of PEGylated Fab’ appear safe in rodents. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The aim of this work was to evaluate the mucus-permeating properties of nanocarriers using zein nanoparticles (NPZ) coated with a Gantrez® AN-thiamine conjugate (GT). NPZ were coated by incubation at different GT-to-zein ratios: 2.5% coating with GT (GT-NPZ1), 5% (GT-NPZ2) and 10% (GT-NPZ3). During the process, the GT conjugate formed a polymer layer around the surface of zein nanoparticles. For GT-NPZ2, the thickness of this corona was estimated between 15 and 20 nm. These nanocarriers displayed a more negative zeta potential than uncoated NPZ. The diffusivity of nanoparticles was evaluated in pig intestinal mucus by multiple particle tracking analysis. GT-NPZ2 displayed a 28-fold higher diffusion coefficient within the mucus layer than NPZ particles. These results align with in vivo biodistribution studies in which NPZ displayed a localisation restricted to the mucus layer, whereas GT-NPZ2 were capable of reaching the intestinal epithelium. The gastro-intestinal transit of mucoadhesive (NPZ) and mucus-permeating nanoparticles (GT-NPZ2) was also found to be different. Thus, mucoadhesive nanoparticles displayed a significant accumulation in the stomach of animals, whereas mucus-penetrating nanoparticles appeared to exit the stomach more rapidly to access the small intestine of animals. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={The manufacturing of the majority of solid oral dosage forms is based on the densification of powder. A good understanding of the powder behavior is therefore essential to assure high quality drug products. This is particularly relevant for the capsule filling process, where the powder bulk density plays an important role in controlling the fill weight and weight variability of the final product. In this study we present a novel approach to quantitatively measure bulk density variations in a rotating container by means of terahertz reflection technology. The terahertz reflection probe was used to measure the powder density using an experimental setup that mimics a lab-scale capsule filling machine including a static sampling tool. Three different grades of α-lactose monohydrate excipients specially designed for inhalation application were systematically investigated at five compression stages. Relative densities predicted from terahertz reflection measurements were correlated to off-line weight measurements of the collected filled capsules. The predictions and the measured weights of the powder in the capsules were in excellent agreement, where the relative density measurements of Lactohale 200 showed the strongest correlation with the respective fill weight (R 2 =0.995). We also studied how the density uniformity of the powder bed was impacted by the dosing process and the subsequent filling of the holes (with excipient powder), which were introduced in the powder bed after the dosing step. Even though the holes seemed to be filled with new powder (by visual inspection), the relative density in these specific segments were found to clearly differ from the undisturbed powder bed state prior to dosing. The results demonstrate that it is feasible to analyze powder density variations in a rotating container by means of terahertz reflection measurements and to predict the fill weight of collected capsules. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Different types of biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs) have been studied as delivery systems for proteins into nasal mucosal cells, especially for vaccine applications. Such a nanocarrier must have the ability to be loaded with proteins and to transport this payload into mucosal cells. However, comparative data on nanoparticles’ capacity for protein loading, efficiency of subsequent endocytosis and the quantity of nanocarriers used are either lacking or contradictory, making comparisons and the choice of a best candidate difficult. Here we compared 5 types of nanoparticles with different surface charge (anionic or cationic) and various inner compositions as potential vectors: the NPL (cationic maltodextrin NP with an anionic lipid core), cationic and anionic PLGA (Poly Lactic co-Glycolic Acid) NP, and cationic and anionic liposomes. We first quantified the protein association efficiency and NPL associated the largest amount of ovalbumin, used as a model protein. In vitro, the delivery of fluorescently-labeled ovalbumin into mucosal cells (airway epithelial cells, dendritic cells and macrophages) was assessed by flow cytometry and revealed that the NPL delivered protein to the greatest extent in all 3 different cell lines. Taken together, these data underlined the potential of the porous and cationic maltodextrin-based NPL as efficient protein delivery systems to mucosal cells. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={Since they were first reported almost two decades ago, fragile-to-strong (FTS) transitions have been observed in all categories of glass-forming systems including metallic, covalent, ionic and molecular liquids. In these systems, a transition from Arrhenius to non-Arrhenius viscosity behavior is observed in conjunction with anomalies in multiple thermodynamic variables including the heat capacity, the thermal expansion coefficient and the isothermal compressibility. A review of experimental evidences supporting the existence of FTS transitions is presented. In particular FTS transitions are found to be concomitant with a peak in heat-capacity as well as density extrema associated with a negative expansion coefficient in the region of the transition. Moreover, spectroscopic analyses also show distinct structural changes across these liquid-liquid transitions. Reports of FTS transitions in each category of liquid are reviewed. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Impurity ions such as transition metals and rare earth metals in Nd-doped phosphate laser glasses will degrade Nd-laser performance, among which Cu is the most harmful. Divalent Cu2+ not only results in an optical loss at Nd-laser wavelength, but also reduces the energy storage for laser amplification. A large-scale production of Nd-doped phosphate laser glasses is required to meet quality demand and to realize economy of scale. To balance between the controlled impurity level in the glasses and the cost of raw materials for thousands of slabs of meter-scale Nd-doped phosphate laser glasses, it is important to determine an upper limit for Nd-laser degradation due to divalent Cu2+ ions. The absorption edge of Cu singly-doped phosphate glass prepared in an oxidizing atmosphere shows the evidence of monovalent Cu+. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is utilized to further verify the existence of monovalent Cu+ ions in Cu, Nd codoped phosphate glass. The results show that both Cu+ and Cu2+ ions most probably coexist in Nd-doped phosphate laser glasses produced in the oxidizing atmosphere to eliminate Pt inclusions in the glasses. Accordingly, this paper discusses the extinction coefficient and the fluorescence quench factor caused by divalent Cu2+ ions, as well as their influence. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={The efficient and reproducible production of nanoparticles using bulk nanoprecipitation methods is still challenging because of low batch to batch reproducibility. Here, we optimize a bulk nanoprecipitation method using design of experiments and translate to a microfluidic device to formulate surface-modified poly-lactic-co-glycolic (PLGA) nanoparticles. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) with a short, long linear or branched architecture were used for the surface modification of PLGA nanoparticles. The microfluidics method was more time efficient than the bulk nanoprecipitation method and allowed the formulation of uniform PLGA nanoparticles with a size of 150 nm, a polydispersity index below 0.150 and with better reproducibility in comparison to the bulk nanoprecipitation method. After surface modification the size of CPP-tagged PLGA nanoparticles increased to 160–180 nm and the surface charge of the CPP-tagged PLGA nanoparticles varied between −24 mV and +3 mV, depending on the architecture and concentration of the conjugated CPP. Covalent attachment of CPPs to the PLGA polymer was confirmed with FTIR by identifying the formation of an amide bond. The conjugation efficiency of CPPs to the polymeric PLGA nanoparticles was between 32 and 80%. The development and design of reproducible nanoformulations with tuneable surface properties is crucial to understand interactions at the nano-bio interface. © 2019},

abstract={The development of mucoadhesive in situ gelling formulations for intravesical application may improve the therapeutic outcomes of bladder cancer patients. In this work, chitosan/β-glycerophosphate (CHIGP) thermosensitive formulations have been prepared using three different chitosan grades (62, 124 and 370 kDa). Their ability to form in situ gelling systems triggered by changes in temperature upon administration to urinary bladder were evaluated using vial inversion and rheological methods. Texture analysis was used to study their mucoadhesive properties as well as syringeability through the urethral catheter. The retention of CHIGP formulations, with fluorescein sodium as the model drug, was studied on porcine urinary bladder mucosa ex vivo using the flow-through technique and fluorescent microscopy. CHIGP formulations containing mitomycin-C were prepared and drug release was studied using in vitro dialysis method. It was established that the molecular weight of chitosan influenced the thermogelling, mucoadhesive and drug release behaviour of the in situ gelling delivery systems. Formulations prepared from chitosan with greatest molecular weight (370 kDa) were found to be the most promising for intravesical application due to their superior gelling properties and in vitro retention in the bladder. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={In the present study, new aledronate (AL) loaded microspheres were prepared with the use of polycaprolactone (PCL)/Vitamin E d-ɑ-tocopheryl poly(ethylene glycol) 1000 succinate (TPGS) copolymers. Specifically, PCL-TPGS copolymers, prepared at several PCL to TPGS ratios (namely, 90/10, 80/20, 70/30 and 60/40 w/w) via a ring opening polymerization process, were characterized by intrinsic viscosity, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and enzymatic hydrolysis. Results showed that as TPGS content increases the intrinsic viscosity of the copolymer (and hence, the viscosity-average molecular weight) is decreasing, while FTIR analysis showed the formation of hydrogen bonds between the [sbnd]C[dbnd]O of PCL and the [sbnd]OH of TPGS. Additionally, XRD analysis indicated that the prepared copolymers were semi-crystalline in nature, while enzymatic hydrolysis studies showed that increasing TGPS content led to increasing copolymer hydrolysis. In the following step, AL drug-loaded microspheres were prepared via single emulsification process. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the formation of coarse drug-loaded microspheres with particle size close to 5 μm, while XRD analysis showed that the API was amorphously dispersed only in the cases of high TPGS content. Furthermore, FTIR analysis showed that the API did not interact with the copolymer components, while in vitro drug release studies showed that increasing PCL content led to decreasing API release rate. Finally, analysis of the drug release profiles suggested that the API release mechanism was solely governed by the polymer matrix erosion. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Subcutaneous delivery of highly concentrated protein formulations is paramount for reducing healthcare cost and improving patient compliance, where reducing the solution viscosity of formulations is critical for drug delivery. The objective of this paper is to provide some mechanistic understanding about the contribution of electrostatic repulsion to the viscosity of protein solutions at high concentrations, along with the effect of excipients such as salts on relative viscosity. Proteins are treated as charged colloids in this paper. At high concentrations, the electrical double layer starts to overlap, and secondary electroviscous effect becomes significant in addition to primary electroviscous effect. In other words, the hydrodynamic volume of proteins plays a great role in influencing their solution viscosity because of the excluded volume effect. Currently, it is hypothesized that the high viscosity of concentrated protein solutions is attributed to formation of clusters due to either electrostatic attraction or hydrophobic interactions, especially for monoclonal antibodies, in which anybody molecules in high concentration formulations may form networks. Consequently, viscosity reduction in the presence of inorganic or organic salts in these formulations is due to breaking up of these networks. In this review, authors hope to provide another point of view based on the effect of the electrostatic repulsion on the excluded volume-hydrodynamic volume. Finally, authors hope the proposed theoretical framework can be used to guide excipient selection in the product development of highly concentrated proteins. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Carbonate looping (CaL) has been shown to be less energy-intensive when compared to mature carbon capture technologies. Further reduction in the efficiency penalties can be achieved by employing a more efficient source of heat for the calcination process, instead of oxy-fuel combustion. In this study, a kW-scale solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)-integrated calciner was designed and developed to evaluate the technical feasibility of simultaneously generating power and driving the calcination process using the high-grade heat of the anode off-gas. Such a system can be integrated with CaL systems, or employed as a negative-emission technology, where the calcines are used to capture CO2 from the atmosphere. The demonstration unit consisted of a planar SOFC stack, operating at 750 °C, and a combined afterburner/calciner to combust hydrogen slip from the anode off-gas, and thermally decompose magnesite, dolomite, and limestone. The demonstrator generated up to 2 kWel,DC power, achieved a temperature in the range of 530–550 °C at the inlet of the afterburner, and up to 678 °C in the calciner, which was sufficient to demonstrate full calcination of magnesite, and partial calcination of dolomite. However, in order to achieve the temperature required for calcination of limestone, further scale-up and heat integration are needed. These results confirmed technical feasibility of the SOFC-calciner concept for production of calcined materials either for the market or for direct air capture (DAC). © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Ascaris eggs are commonly used as indicators for pathogen inactivation during the treatment of fecal sludge and wastewater due to their highly resistant lipid membrane and ability to survive in the environment for long periods of time. Current guidelines suggest that thermal treatment alone cannot inactivate Ascaris eggs at temperatures below 45 °C, although some evidence in the literature suggests this to be incorrect. Here, we performed a controlled experiment to test the effect of mesophilic temperatures on Ascaris inactivation. We exposed Ascaris suum eggs to a temperature gradient between 34°C and 45 °C under anaerobic and aerobic conditions to observe the required exposure times for a 3-log reduction. Indeed, we found that temperatures lower than 45 °C did inactivate these eggs, and the required exposure times were up to two orders of magnitude shorter than suggested by current guidelines. Results from the anaerobic exposures were used to develop a time-temperature relationship that is appropriate for Ascaris inactivation at mesophilic temperatures. Data from the literature demonstrated that our relationship is conservative, with faster inactivation occurring under environmental conditions when Ascaris eggs were suspended in fecal sludge or manure. A specific aerobic relationship was not developed, but we demonstrated that aerobic conditions cause faster inactivation than anaerobic conditions. Therefore, the anaerobic relationship provides a conservative guideline for both conditions. We demonstrate that relatively low temperatures can considerably impact Ascaris viability and suggest that mesophilic temperatures can be used in waste treatment processes to inactivate pathogens. The development of safe, low-input, mesophilic treatment processes is particularly valuable for ensuring universal access to safe sanitation and excreta management. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Ethosomes are widely used to promote transdermal permeation of both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs, but the mechanism of interaction between the ethosomes and the skin remains unclear. In this work, it was exploded with several technologies and facilities. Firstly, physical techniques such as attenuated total reflectance fourier-transform infrared and laser confocal Raman were used and the results indicated that the phospholipids configuration of stratum corneum changes from steady state to unstable state with the treatment of ethosomes. Differential scanning calorimetry reflected the thermodynamics change in stratum corneum after treatment with ethosomes. The results revealed that the skin of Bama mini-pigs, which is similar to human skin, treated by ethosomes had a relatively low Tm and enthalpy. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed that the microstructure and ultrastructure of stratum corneum was not damaged by ethosomes treatment. Furthermore, confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that lipid labeled ethosomes could penetrate the skin via stratum corneum mainly through intercellular route, while during the process of penetration, phospholipids were retained in the upper epidermis. Cell experiments confirmed that ethosomes were distributed mainly on the cell membrane. Further study showed that only the drug-loaded ethosomes increased the amount of permeated drug. The current study, for the first time, elucidated the mechanistic behavior of ethosomes in transdermal application from molecular configuration, thermodynamic properties, ultrastructure, fluorescent labeling and cellular study. It is anticipated that the approaches and results described in the present study will benefit for better design of drug-loaded ethosomes. © 2019},

abstract={Characterising the structural dynamics of proteins and the effects of excipients are critical for optimising the design of formulations. In this work we investigated four lyophilised formulations containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) and three formulations containing a monoclonal antibody (mAb, here mAb1), and explored the role of the excipients polysorbate 80, sucrose, trehalose, and arginine on stabilising proteins. By performing temperature variable terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) experiments it is possible to study the vibrational dynamics of these formulations. The THz-TDS measurements reveal two distinct glass transition processes in all tested formulations. The lower temperature transition, Tg,β, is associated with the onset of local motion due to the secondary relaxation whilst the higher temperature transition, Tg,α, marks the onset of the α-relaxation. For some of the formulations, containing globular BSA as well as mAb1, the absorption at terahertz frequencies does not increase further at temperatures above Tg,α. Such behaviour is in contrast to our previous observations for small organic molecules as well as linear polymers where absorption is always observed to steadily increase with temperature due to the stronger absorption of terahertz radiation by more mobile dipoles. The absence of such further increase in absorption with higher temperatures therefore suggests a localised confinement of the protein/excipient matrix at high temperatures that hinders any further increase in mobility. We found that subtle changes in excipient composition had an effect on the transition temperatures Tg,α and Tg,β as well as the vibrational confinement in the solid state. Further work is required to establish the potential significance of the vibrational confinement in the solid state on formulation stability and chemical degradation as well as what role the excipients play in achieving such confinement. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Acne vulgaris is a clinically distinct skin condition with evidence suggesting that inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Treatment of severe inflammatory acne often involves the use of oral antibiotics, sometimes in combination with topical products. Oral antibiotics often result in systemic side effects and the risks of antibiotic resistance, but no commercial topical minocycline is currently available. We have developed a unique, stable, hydrophilic topical gel formulation with fully solubilized minocycline (MNC-H). Minocycline delivered in our hydrophilic gel remained more stable in situ, resulting in less degradation product (4-epiminocycline) than a lipophilic formulation (MNC-L). The hydrophilic nature of our formulation enabled 2–3 fold increase in delivery into the skin ex vivo compared to a lipophilic counterpart, mostly seen in the epidermis and pilosebaceous units. The lipophilic formulation also appeared to be more occlusive, resulting in higher sebum production in minipigs, which may exacerbate acne vulgaris. As our results indicate, a 1, 2% minocycline hydrophilic gel may deliver sufficient drug (>15 μg/g) to potentially demonstrate clinical efficacy. These findings suggest that topical hydrophilic minocycline gel may provide a novel tool for topical acne therapy. © 2019},

abstract={A standardized in vitro simulation of the human gastrointestinal tract (M-SHIME®) was used to assess the effect of repeated daily administration of a synbiotic formulation, containing five spore-forming Bacillus strains and a prebiotic fiber blend, on the microbial activity and composition of three simulated human subjects. Firstly, while confirming recent findings, deeper phylogenetic insight was obtained in the resident M-SHIME® microbiota, demonstrating that the model maintains a diverse and representative, colon region-specific luminal and mucosal microbial community. Supplementation of the synbiotic concept increased microbial diversity in the distal colon areas, whereas specific enhancement of Bacillaceae levels was observed in the ascending colon suggesting a successful engraftment of the Bacillus spores, which probably resulted in a stimulatory effect on, among others, Bifidobacteriaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Prevotellaceae, Tannerellaceae and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii contributing directly or indirectly to stimulation of acetate, propionate and butyrate production. When compared with a previous study investigating the Bacillus strains, the generated data suggest a synergistic effect on the intestinal microbiota for the synbiotic formulation. Given the fact that the probiotic strains have been shown to impact post-prandial metabolic endotoxemia in human individuals, it might be interesting to further investigate the efficacy of the synbiotic concept in protecting against obesity-related disorders. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={A range of enteric polymers is used in pharmaceutical industry for developing gastro-resistant formulations. It is generally implied that these coatings are interchangeable due to similar dissolution pH thresholds reported by suppliers. Despite rapid dissolution in compendial phosphate buffers, these products can take up to 2 h to disintegrate in-vivo in the human small intestine. The factors primarily responsible for such variability in dissolution of these polymeric coatings are the differences in ionisation of acidic functional groups on polymer chains and their interplay with ions and buffer species present in gastrointestinal fluids. In this study, we aim to develop a novel, simple and inexpensive technique that can be used under various in-vitro conditions to study the ionisation behaviour of commonly used polymers (EUDRAGIT-E100, L100, S100, HPMC AS-LF, AS-HF, HP-50, HP-55) and to estimate their pKa. Moreover, this method was successfully applied to study the ionisation behaviour of a range of natural polymers (Guar, Tara, locust bean, Konjac gums, gum Arabic, citrus pectin, chitosan and alginate) and their pKa was also estimated. The proposed method would allow a better understanding of the dissolution behaviour of these polymers within gastrointestinal tract and will aid rational design of modified release dosage forms. © 2019},

abstract={The paths via which university-generated knowledge reaches final users and creates value are traditionally considered to be the supply-side channels of the commercialisation of inventions, consultancy, and R&D contracts. Yet, this focus limits universities to being “providers” of knowledge and technology for industrial applications and fails to account for the diversity of mechanisms responsible for the diffusion of academic activities. This paper aims to complete the existing understanding of the contribution made by universities to the corporate innovation process by recognising the impact of university demand on the innovative performance of firms in the scientific value chain. We study the impact of a large French public university on the innovative performance of its suppliers of scientific equipment. We perform micro-econometric analyses showing that university suppliers have a higher propensity to introduce new-to-the-market product innovations than do other firms belonging to the same sectors and with similar characteristics. Our results provide support to the conjecture that innovations and technological changes are the result not only of scientific and technical discoveries, but also of a complex chain reaction triggered by the interplay between specific demands and solutions designed to overcome technology bottlenecks. © 2019},

We developed quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays to quantify haloalkaliphilic sulfur-oxidizing gammaproteobacterial species Alkalilimnicola ehrlichii, Thioalkalivibrio sulfidiphilus, and Thioalkalibacter halophilus that dominate bacterial communities of biodesulfurization lab- and full-scale installations at haloalkaline conditions. The specificity and PCR efficiency of novel primer sets were evaluated using pure cultures of these target species. We further validated the qPCR assays by quantification of target organisms in five globally distributed full-scale biodesulfurization installations. The qPCR assays perform a sensitive and accurate quantification of Alkalilimnicola ehrlichii, Thioalkalivibrio sulfidiphilus and Thioalkalibacter halophilus, thus providing rapid and valuable insights into process performance and SOB growth dynamics in gas biodesulfurization systems. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={An important goal in synthetic biology is to maximize the expression levels of proteins. For this purpose, multiple genes encoding the same protein can be integrated into the host genome. However, this approach is affected by two key issues. Firstly, codons with better adaptation indexes should be used, since some synonymous codons are better adapted than others. Secondly, the multiple protein-coding sequences should be as different as possible to avoid the loss of gene copies due to homologous recombination. Therefore, this task shows strict biological requirements that make it difficult to tackle. In this work, we design and implement a computational intelligence approach to address this problem, the Multi-Objective Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (MOSFLA). This method combines the optimization capabilities provided by parallel searches, multiple operators, and memetic strategies to tackle problems with difficult solution quality requirements. Several alternatives have been comparatively analyzed, including MOSFLA variants with three objectives as in other approaches from the literature and also variants with only two objectives. Experiments on nine real-world protein datasets give account of the improved, statistically significant performance achieved over the related work, attending to different quality metrics, confirming that our proposal satisfactorily deals with the complex nature of the problem. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Metformin, an inexpensive, well-tolerated oral agent that is a commonly used first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, has become the focus of intense research as a potential anticancer agent. In this study, we describe the inhibitory effect of metformin in interleukin 8 (IL-8) upregulation by lithocholic acid (LCA) in HCT116 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Pharmacological inhibition studies indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were involved in LCA-induced IL-8 upregulation through activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. Metformin was demonstrated to block LCA-stimulated ROS production, in turn suppressing NF-κB signaling that was critical for IL-8 upregulation. An NADPH oxidase assay proved that the inhibitory effect of metformin on ROS production was derived from its strong suppression of NADPH oxidase, a key producer of ROS in cells. Compared with conditioned media (CM) derived from HCT116 cells treated with LCA, CM derived from HCT116 cells pretreated with metformin and then treated with LCA lost all stimulatory effect on endothelial cell proliferation and tubelike formation. In conclusion, metformin inhibited NADPH oxidase, which in turn suppressed ROS production and NF-κB activation to prevent IL-8 upregulation stimulated by LCA; this prevention thus obstructed endothelial cell proliferation and tubelike formation. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Capsule: Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, like benzo[a]pyrene, increases, in-vitro and in-vivo, production of exosomes and microvesicles and modifies their compositions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd
Environmental contaminants, to which humans are widely exposed, cause or worsen several diseases, like cardiovascular diseases and cancers. Among these molecules, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) stand out since they are ubiquitous pollutants found in ambient air and diet. Because of their toxic effects, public Health agencies promote development of research studies aiming at increasing the knowledge about PAHs and the discovery of biomarkers of exposure and/or effects. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including small extracellular vesicles (S-EVs or exosomes) and large extracellular vesicles (L-EVs or microvesicles), are delivery systems for multimolecular messages related to the nature and status of the originating cells. Because they are produced by all cells and detected within body fluids, EV releases could act as cell responses and thereby serve as biomarkers. To test whether EVs can serve as biomarkers of PAHs exposure, we evaluate the effects of these pollutants on EV production using an in vitro approach (human endothelial cell line, HMEC-1) and an in vivo approach (urine samples from PAHs-exposed rats). Our study indicates that, i) PAH exposure increases in vitro the EV production by endothelial cells and in vivo the release of EVs in urine, and that the stimulating effects of PAHs concern both S-EVs and L-EVs; ii) PAH exposure and more particularly exposure to B[a]P, can influence the composition of exosomes produced by endothelial cells; iii) the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, a cytosolic receptor associated to most deleterious effects of PAHs, would be involved in the PAH effects on the release of S-EVs, but not L-EVs. These results suggest that EVs may have utility for monitoring exposure to PAHs, and more particularly to B[a]P, considered as reference PAH, and to detect the related early cellular response prior to end-organ damages. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Resource recovery based wastewater services, capable of converting wastewater into clean water, energy, and fertilizer, begun to gain global attention. However, Water Footprints (WFs) of resource recovery based wastewater systems remain unknown. This study provided the first assessment on WFs of resource recovery based wastewater systems. A process-based approach was used to estimate WFs of five representative wastewater systems were including a conventional once-through system (BAU) and four resource recovery based systems. The analyses found that BAU presented the highest total WF, with a median value of 15.9 m3/household/day. In contrast, composting toilet and septic system (CT-SS) showed the lowest total WF, with a median value of 3.4 m3/household/day. The indirect WF and direct grey WFs each contributed to approximately half of total WF for BAU. For four resource recovery based systems, indirect WFs ranked as a dominating contributor, resulting in more than 75% of their total WFs. The WFs of all five systems presented significant variability, mainly because of the embedded variations in electricity's water intensities, electricity consumption during various treatment stages, and effluent quality. The sensitivity analyses indicated that water intensity of electricity was the most influential parameter for total WFs for all five systems. In addition, the comparison across life cycle energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, eutrophication and WF indicators suggested environmental tradeoffs existed among resource recovery based systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

The waste must be immobilized and permanently stored, and the plan is to separate the tank wastes into low activity waste (LAW) and high-level waste (HLW) streams. The U.S. Department of Energy is building a Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant at Hanford site to separately vitrify these two waste streams in borosilicate glass using Joule-heated ceramic melters (JHCM). Although the process of nuclear waste vitrification seems to be well established, in practicality, it is faced with complex problems starting from the design of glass compositions, to processing in melters and long-term performance of the final vitrified waste forms.

abstract={Cats have been known to be extremely sensitive to chemical exposures. To understand these model species' sensitivity to chemicals and their toxicities, the expression profiles of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes should be studied. Unfortunately, the characterization of cytochrome P450 (CYP), the dominant enzyme in phase I metabolism, in cats has not extensively been studied. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are known as CYP inducers in animals, but the information regarding the PCB-induced CYP expression in cats is limited. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to elucidate the mRNA expression of the CYP1–CYP3 families in the cat tissues and to investigate the CYP mRNA expression related to PCB exposure. In cats, the greatest abundance of CYP1–CYP3 (CYP1A2, CYP2A13, CYP2C41, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP2E2, CYP2F2, CYP2F5, CYP2J2, CYP2U1, and CYP3A132) was expressed in the liver, but some extrahepatic isozymes were found in the kidney (CYP1A1), heart (CYP1B1), lung (CYP2B11 and CYP2S1) and small intestine (CYP3A131). In cats, CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 were significantly upregulated in the liver as well as in several tissues exposed to PCBs, indicating that these CYPs were distinctly induced by PCBs. The strong correlations between 3,3′,4,4′-tetrachlorobiphenyl (CB77) and CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA expressions were noted, demonstrating that CB77 could be a potent CYP1 inducer. In addition, these CYP isoforms could play an essential role in the PCBs biotransformation, particularly 3–4 Cl-PCBs, because a high hydroxylated metabolite level of 3–4 Cl-OH-PCBs was observed in the liver. © 2019},

abstract={The antidiabetic drug metformin has been proposed to affect non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) through its effects on intestinal microbiota and barrier function. However, so far most studies focused on long-term effects and more progressed disease stages. The aim of this study was to assess in two experimental settings, if the onset of NAFLD is associated with changes of intestinal microbiota and barrier function and to determine effects of metformin herein. C57Bl/6J mice were fed a liquid control diet (C) or fat-, fructose- and cholesterol-rich diet (FFC) for four days or six weeks ±300 mg/kg BW/day metformin (Met). Markers of liver health, intestinal barrier function and microbiota composition were assessed. Metformin treatment markedly attenuated FFC-induced NAFLD in both experiments with markers of inflammation and lipidperoxidation in livers of FFC + Met-fed mice being almost at the level of controls. Metformin treatment attenuated the loss of tight junction proteins in small intestine and the increase of bacterial endotoxin levels in portal plasma. Changes of intestinal microbiota found in FFC-fed mice were also significantly blunted in FFC + Met-fed mice. Taken together, protective effects of metformin on the onset of NAFLD are associated with changes of intestinal microbiota composition and lower translocation of bacterial endotoxins. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Non-target screening (NTS) including suspect screening with high resolution mass spectrometry has already shown its feasibility in detecting and identifying emerging contaminants, which subsequently triggered exposure mitigating measures. NTS has a large potential for tasks such as effective evaluation of regulations for safe marketing of substances and products, prioritization of substances for monitoring programmes and assessment of environmental quality. To achieve this, a further development of NTS methodology is required, including: (i) harmonized protocols and quality requirements, (ii) infrastructures for efficient data management, data evaluation and data sharing and (iii) sufficient resources and appropriately trained personnel in the research and regulatory communities in Europe. Recommendations for achieving these three requirements are outlined in the following discussion paper. In particular, in order to facilitate compound identification it is recommended that the relevant information for interpretation of mass spectra, as well as about the compounds usage and production tonnages, should be made accessible to the scientific community (via open-access databases). For many purposes, NTS should be implemented in combination with effect-based methods to focus on toxic chemicals. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={The purpose of this review is to compare and contrast silicate natural glasses with so-called un-natural glasses, bringing together literature and common issues in geology and technical glass science and engineering. The review is organized into three proposed ‘frontiers’ of glass science of interdisciplinary interest: 1) extreme conditions for glass formation, 2) crystallization in complex glasses, and 3) long-term glass alteration. In each frontier, examples of natural (geologic) as well as un-natural (accidental anthropogenic) glasses are presented, and their characteristics are compared and contrasted. Since crystallization is an important consideration, not only fully amorphous glasses but also partially crystallized glasses are considered. Natural glasses discussed include primarily impactites, obsidian, and basaltic glass, though glasses formed by other means are also considered. Un-natural glasses discussed include those created in atomic blasts, vitrified Iron Age hillforts, and slags from metallurgical processes. Conditions for extreme glass formation in different types of glasses formed by shock metamorphism are compared to modern time-resolved shock and high-pressure experiments for observing polyamorphism and densification changes. Silicate magmas producing obsidian and basaltic glasses are presented and the differences in crystallization pathways are discussed as they relate to changes in flow properties and eruptions. Vitrified hillfort materials and combustion natural glasses are then compared with respect to their felsic-mafic liquid phase separation and crystal assemblage. Finally, an appeal is made for the use of natural and un-natural glasses for understanding long-term glass corrosion as a function of composition. Glass corrosion models are considered as applied to both types of glasses, particularly relating to the neo-formed crystals, biologically-induced glass corrosion, and nuclear waste management. It is hoped that this unorthodox presentation will foster dialogue between earth scientists and technical glass scientists and further research into these and other frontiers of natural glass science. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are prominent components of tumor stroma that promotes tumorigenesis. Many soluble factors participate in the deleterious cross-talk between TAMs and transformed cells; however mechanisms how tumors orchestrate their production remain relatively unexplored. c-Myb is a transcription factor recently described as a negative regulator of a specific immune signature involved in breast cancer (BC) metastasis. Here we studied whether c-Myb expression is associated with an increased presence of TAMs in human breast tumors. Tumors with high frequency of c-Myb-positive cells have lower density of CD68-positive macrophages. The negative association is reflected by inverse correlation between MYB and CD68/CD163 markers at the mRNA levels in evaluated cohorts of BC patients from public databases, which was found also within the molecular subtypes. In addition, we identified potential MYB-regulated TAMs recruiting factors that in combination with MYB and CD163 provided a valuable clinical multigene predictor for BC relapse. We propose that identified transcription program running in tumor cells with high MYB expression and preventing macrophage accumulation may open new venues towards TAMs targeting and BC therapy. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={The excitability of neurons is tightly dependent on their ion channel repertoire. Among these channels, the leak sodium channel NALCN plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the resting membrane potential. Importantly, NALCN mutations lead to complex neurodevelopmental syndromes, including infantile hypotonia with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies (IHPRF) and congenital contractures of limbs and face, hypotonia and developmental delay (CLIFAHDD), which are recessively and dominantly inherited, respectively. Unfortunately, the biophysical properties of NALCN are still largely unknown to date, as well as the functional consequences of both IHPRF and CLIFAHDD mutations on NALCN current. Here we have set-up the heterologous expression of NALCN in the neuronal cell line NG108-15 to investigate the electrophysiological properties of NALCN carrying representative IHPRF and CLIFAHDD mutations. Several original properties of the wild-type (wt) NALCN current were retrieved: mainly carried by external Na+, blocked by Gd3+, insensitive to TTX and potentiated by low external Ca2+ concentration. However, we found that this current displays a time-dependent inactivation in the −80/−40 mV range of membrane potential, and a non linear current-voltage relationship indicative of voltage sensitivity. Importantly, no detectable current was recorded with the IHPRF missense mutation p.Trp1287Leu (W1287L), while the CLIFAHDD mutants, p.Leu509Ser (L509S) and p.Tyr578Ser (Y578S), showed higher current densities and slower inactivation, compared to wt NALCN current. This study reveals that heterologous expression of NALCN channel can be achieved in the neuronal cell line NG108-15 to study the electrophysiological properties of wt and mutants. From our results, we conclude that IHPRF and CLIFAHDD missense mutations are loss- and gain-of-function variants, respectively. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a potent neurotoxin responsible for countless human intoxications and deaths around the world. The distribution of TTX and its analogues is diverse and the toxin has been detected in organisms from both marine and terrestrial environments. Increasing detections seafood species, such as bivalves and gastropods, has drawn attention to the toxin, reinvigorating scientific interest and regulatory concerns. There have been reports of TTX in 21 species of bivalves and edible gastropods from ten countries since the 1980's. While TTX is structurally dissimilar to saxitoxin (STX), another neurotoxin detected in seafood, it has similar sodium channel blocking action and potency and both neurotoxins have been shown to have additive toxicities. The global regulatory level for the STX group toxins applied to shellfish is 800 μg/kg. The presence of TTX in shellfish is only regulated in one country; The Netherlands, with a regulatory level of 44 μg/kg. Due to the recent interest surrounding TTX in bivalves, the European Food Safety Authority established a panel to assess the risk and regulation of TTX in bivalves, and their final opinion was that a concentration below 44 μg of TTX per kg of shellfish would not result in adverse human effects. In this article, we review current knowledge on worldwide TTX levels in edible gastropods and bivalves over the last four decades, the different methods of detection used, and the current regulatory status. We suggest research needs that will assist with knowledge gaps and ultimately allow development of robust monitoring and management protocols. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Drawing on the conceptual framing and mechanisms of actor-network theory (ANT), we focus on the relationships among human and non-human actors and their roles to enact new products. We do this to contribute both evidence and theory regarding the concept of a sociotechnical assemblage that serves as the innovation network. Advancing a sociotechnical conceptualization of innovation focuses attention on the contributions of, and linkages among, different types of actors; individuals and organizations, visions and concepts, and technological artifacts and prototypes together create a means for innovation to occur. The empirical basis for this theorizing comes from a detailed study of the community of research scientists, faculty, and graduate students; institutions such as research labs, funding sources, and product companies who were (and mostly still are) involved in tabletop computing. Analysis highlights the centrality of visions, concepts and technological artifacts in the innovation network. We also find that formal organizations play important, but often unrealized, roles in supporting innovation. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={Mutated RNA splicing machinery drives many human diseases and is a promising therapeutic target for engineering and small molecule therapy. In the case of mutations in individual genes that cause them to be incorrectly spliced, engineered splicing factors can be introduced to correct splicing of these aberrant transcripts and reduce the effects of the disease phenotype. Mutations that occur in certain splicing factor genes themselves have been implicated in many cancers, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes. Small molecules that target splicing factors have been developed as therapies to preferentially induce apoptosis in these cancer cells. Specifically, drugs targeting the splicing factor SF3B1 have led to recent clinical trials. Here, we review the role of alternative splicing in disease, approaches to rescue incorrect splicing using engineered splicing factors, and small molecule splicing inhibitors developed to treat hematological cancers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The particulate dry deposition was estimated based on measurements using Teflon string samplers as surrogate surfaces, in combination with the net throughfall deposition for sodium (throughfall subtracted with wet deposition). The wet deposition was estimated from bulk deposition measurements, corrected for dry deposition to the collectors. There was a strong gradient for total inorganic nitrogen (N) deposition across Sweden from north to southwest, ranging from 2 to 20 kg N ha−1 yr−1. The values for N deposition derived from measurements were for most sites exceeding the corresponding values derived from modelling with the MATCH and EMEP models, in southern Sweden by up to 4–6 kg N ha−1 y−1. Based on comparisons between total and throughfall deposition, the canopy uptake of atmospheric N deposition to Norway spruce forests in Sweden was estimated to be in the range of 0–7 kg N ha−1 yr−1. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Dairy intensification is a widely used means of achieving food security, improving farmer incomes and enhancing overall economic growth. However, intensification is dependent upon the availability and suitability of natural resources to sustain growth in production. Here, land and water footprints of milk production in three contrasting agro-ecological zones ranging from humid to semi-arid across nine counties of Kenya are quantified. Water and land use footprints across three potential intensification pathways are also outlined and evaluated against the baseline scenario, the currently prevailing practices or the S1 Futures scenario, treated as the benchmark. Intensification pathways focusing on improving livestock breeds, feed provisioning and milk output per cow and distinguished by contrasting management practices perform differentially across the three agro-ecological zones. Total water and land footprints increase for all scenarios relative to the baseline scenario. In particular, all the breed improvement scenarios, have much larger total water footprints than the baseline scenario. Improvement in breed to pure bred cattle across all production systems has the largest total water footprint across all the production systems. Across all the scenarios, the largest reduction in water footprint of milk production (75%) occurs with improvement in breed and feeding practices from two scenarios in the lowlands. Milk production by the cross-bred cattle is most efficient in the lowlands system whereas milk production by the pure breed Ayrshire is most land use efficient in the midlands system. Across the three agroecological zones, improving breeds, feed provisioning and milk production per cow may achieve production intensification but concurrently exacerbates resource limitation. Consequently, the heterogeneity inherent in resource availability across dairy production zones should be considered when developing strategies for increasing dairy production. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Deionization devices that use intercalation reactions to reversibly store and release cations from solution show promise for energy-efficient desalination of alternative water resources. Intercalation materials often display low electronic conductivity that results in increased energy consumption during desalination. Accordingly, we performed experiments to quantify the impact of the size and mass fraction of conductive additives and insulative active particles on the effective electronic conductivity, ionic conductivity, and hydraulic permeability of porous electrodes. We find that Ketjen black conductive additives with nodules &lt;50 nm in diameter produce superior electronic conductivity at lower mass fractions than the larger carbon blacks commonly used in capacitive deionization. Hydraulic permeability and effective ionic conductivity depend weakly on carbon black content and size, though smaller active particles decrease hydraulic permeability. Based on these results we analyzed the energy consumption and salt removal rate of different electrode formulations by constructing an electrochemical Ashby plot predicting the variation of desalination performance with electrode transport properties. Optimized electrodes containing insulative Prussian blue analogue (PBA) particles were then fabricated and used in an experimental cation intercalation desalination (CID) cell with symmetric electrodes. For 100 mM NaCl influent energy consumption varied from 7 to 33 kJ/mol when current density increased from 1 to 8 mA/cm2, approaching ten-fold increased salt removal rate at similar energy consumption levels to past CID demonstrations. Complementary numerical and analytical modeling indicates that further improvements in energy consumption and salt removal rate are attainable by enhancing transport in solution and within PBA agglomerates. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Essential oils have been used in clinical therapies and healing practices for several chronic diseases, but it is still challenging their extent use due to their poor stability. Nanotechnology delivery systems have been proposed as an alternative to improve their stability. Oregano (Origanum vulgare L.) is one of the most important medicinal plant highly reputed as an efficient remedy for infectious diseases. This study proposes the use of polycaprolactone, a biodegradable polymer, as a wall material for the encapsulation of Origanum vulgare L. essential oil, a carvacrol-rich source, using the nanoprecipitation and double emulsion methods. Nanocapsules formulations showed different values of mean particle size ranged between 175.17 ± 0.31 nm and 220.93 ± 2.73 nm, negative zeta potential values ranged between −18.7 ± 0.50 mV up to −42.53 ± 1.01 mV, and encapsulation efficiencies ranging from 50.36 ± 1.86% and 85.89 ± 2.40%. The optimized nano-formulation presented a nano-scale size of 181.6 ± 2.17 nm, a monomodal size distribution with a polydispersity index of 0.133 ± 0.01, a pH value of 4.92 and a zeta potential value of −40.9 ± 0.93 mV. The encapsulation efficiency of 85.89 ± 2.40% was achieved. In addition, microspheres produced by double emulsion, demonstrated porous microspheres morphology in the size of 1759.00 ± 162.6 nm, pH value of 5.98, a zeta potential value of −15.7 ± 1.56 mV and encapsulation efficiency of 47.52 ± 0.52%. Dynamic light scattering and scanning electron microscopy were performed to verify the size and the colloidal morphology. Thermal properties were assessed by thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry and the measurements revealed the thermal stability of the particles and showed that the crystalline state was less ordered in nanocapsules. Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared results indicated a slight shift in the C[dbnd]O band of the polymer from 1723 cm−1 induced by the change in its crystallinity degree due to the successful incorporation of oregano within its shell. Moreover, the long-term stability study was carried out for a period of 60 days at 4 ± 2 °C, 25 ± 2 °C and 40 ± 2 °C. Results showed that nanocapsules were physically stable with high carvacrol retention at different temperatures. However when microspheres were thermally treated at 25 °C and 40 °C, an increase in particle size was observed. Besides, carvacrol retention decreased to 64.56% and 61.84% at 25 °C and 40 °C, respectively. From gathered results, the good physical stability of nanocapsules in long-term storage with high carvacrol retention stability were observed mainly at 4 °C. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Timescales and residence times in reactive multiphase flows are essential for product selectivity. For instance when a gas species is consumed, e.g., by a competitive consecutive reaction with moderate reaction kinetics where reaction timescales are comparable to relevant mixing timescales. To point out the importance of the details of the fluid flow, we analyze experimental velocity data from a Taylor bubble wake by means of Lagrangian methods. By adjusting the channel diameter in which the Taylor bubble rises, and thus the rise velocity, we obtain three different wake regimes. Remarkably, the residence times of passive particles advected in the bubble wake's velocity field show a peak for intermediate rise velocities. This observation seems unintuitive at first glance because one expects a faster removal of passive tracers for a faster overall flow rate. However, the details of the flow topology analyzed using Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) fields and Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) reveal the existence of a coherent vortical pattern in the bubble wake which explains the long residence times. The increased residence times within the vortical structure in combination with the close bubble interface acting as a constant gas species source could enhance side product generation of a hypothetical competitive consecutive reaction, where the first reaction with the gas species forms the desired product and the second the side product. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The mRMJR-KCCA maximizes the relevance between the feature candidate and the target class labels and simultaneously minimizes the joint redundancy between the feature candidate and the already selected features in the view of KCCA. To improve the computation efficiency, we adopt the Incomplete Cholesky Decomposition to approximate the kernel matrix in implementing the KCCA in mRMJR-KCCA for larger-size datasets. The proposed method is experimentally evaluated on 13 classification-associated datasets. Compared with certain popular feature selection methods, the experimental results demonstrate the better performance of the proposed mRMJR-KCCA. © 2019},

abstract={Forecasting future trends of the stock market using the historical data is the exigent demand in the field of academia as well as business. This work has explored the feature optimization capacity of firefly with an evolutionary framework considering the biochemical and social aspects of Firefly algorithm, along with the selection procedure of objective value in evolutionary notion. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using four different stock market datasets, such as BSE Sensex, NSE Sensex, S&P 500 index and FTSE index. The datasets are regenerated using the proper mathematical formulation of the fundamental part belonging to technical analysis, such as technical indicators and statistical measures. The feature reduction through transformation is carried out on the enhanced dataset before employing the experimented dataset to the prediction models such as Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OSELM) and Recurrent Back Propagation Neural Network (RBPNN). For feature reduction, both statistical and optimized based feature reduction strategies are considered, where Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis (FA) are examined for statistical based feature reduction and Firefly Optimization (FO), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Firefly algorithm with evolutionary framework are well thought out for optimized feature reduction techniques. An empirical comparison is established among the experimented prediction models considering all the feature reduction techniques for the time horizon of 1 day, 3 days, 5 days, 7 days, 5 days and 30 days in advance, applying on all the datasets used in this study. From the simulation result, it can be clearly figured out that firefly with evolutionary framework optimized feature reduction applying to OSELM prediction model outperformed over the rest experimented models. © 2019},

abstract={Strongylus vulgaris is considered the most pathogenic nematode parasite of the horse. Frequent deworming programs since the 1970s have reduced the prevalence of S. vulgaris to low levels, but to the price of widespread benzimidazole resistance in the small strongyles (cyathostominae) and ivermectin resistance especially in the equine roundworm Parascaris spp. To slow down the progression of anthelmintic resistance in Sweden, horse anthelmintics were made prescription only medicine in 2007 and selective therapy principles were introduced. This means that only individuals with high egg excretion or clinical signs of helminth infection were treated instead of blanket treatment of all horses on a farm. The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence and risk factors associated with S. vulgaris infection in Sweden ten years after the introduction of a selective therapy regime. A total of 529 faecal samples from 106 farms were collected during March to June in 2016 and 2017. A web-based questionnaire was used to collect information about deworming routines. Strongyle faecal egg counts (FEC) were performed by McMaster and presence of S. vulgaris was demonstrated with a specific PCR on individual larval cultures. Results were analysed by mixed logistic (S. vulgaris prevalence) or linear (FEC) regression models, where farm was included as random factor. The overall prevalence of S. vulgaris at individual and farm levels was 28% and 61%, respectively. We observed a 2.9 increased odds risk of S. vulgaris infection on farms that based their treatment on strongyle FEC only as compared to farms that complemented strongyle FECs with larval cultures or dewormed regularly, 1–4 times per year, without prior diagnosis. We found no association between the prevalence of S. vulgaris and strongyle FEC level, horse age, geographical region or signs of colic. The prevalence of S. vulgaris was 25% in horses shedding ≤150 eggs per gram. Thus horses with low strongyle FECs that are left untreated could be an important source of S. vulgaris infection. This may be an important reason for the approximately three-fold increase in S. vulgaris prevalence since 1999 in Sweden. However, our combined results indicate that selective therapy based on a combination of strongyle FECs and larval cultivation was not associated with an increased risk of S. vulgaris infection. Still, S. vulgaris needs to be monitored continuously and should be taken into careful consideration when the treatment frequency is reduced. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Steady flow of particulate or granular materials and bulk solids through a hopper plays a critical role in many industrial and process engineering applications. The present work investigates hopper discharge of non-spherical particles, specifically cylindrical particles, from a rectangular hopper. The behavior of steel cylindrical particles with varying aspect ratio (both varying diameter with constant length and varying length with constant diameter) was explored experimentally and via DEM simulations. In addition, the effects of fill height, particle friction, hopper orifice width and hopper cone angle on hopper discharge rate of non-spherical particles were studied via DEM simulations and compared with previously published experimental correlations, experimental results of spherical particles. The results indicate that DEM simulations are fully capable of reproducing trends that are established experimentally. The results with particles of high aspect ratio indicate a different trend than that previously observed with rounded particles. As the fill height increases, the mass discharge rate increases and then asymptotes; further increases in fill height cause a decrease in the mass discharge rate. Further, the effect of particle friction showed a significant influence on the hopper discharge behavior. In addition, a decrease in the hopper angle from 90 degree to critical angle 55 degree decreases the mass discharge rate flow and further decrease in hopper angle increases the discharge rate rapidly. © 2019},

abstract={Bubbly flows are used in industrial processes to facilitate efficient mass and heat transfer for gas-liquid contact operations accompanied by chemical transformations, which are often associated with substantial heat liberation due to exothermic reactions. In this paper we study the heat transfer enhancement from a hot wall to bulk liquid, in the presence of bubbles. We use computational fluid dynamics, and specifically apply the local front reconstruction method as interface-tracking method. When a single bubble rises near a wall, the thermal boundary layer is sharpened enhancing heat transfer. This enhancement is initially located near the equator of the bubble, and then shifts to the wake of the bubble. Using stream wise periodic boundary conditions for flow and heat transfer, the wall-to-liquid heat transfer for developed flow conditions is quantified as function of gas fraction. The enhancement is strongly correlated with the relative bubble distance from the wall. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Toxoplasma gondii is the causative agent of the parasitic disease toxoplasmosis, which is an important foodborne zoonosis. Eating undercooked meat of infected animals, including pigs, has been considered the major transmission route of T. gondii to humans. Therefore, it is urgent to develop and implement intervention measures in the pork meat chain to reduce risks of acquiring a T. gondii infection. Proposed measures for control of T. gondii in pigs include serological testing of pigs and audits of pig farms on risk factors for T. gondii infection. So far, these ideas have not been tested in practice. In order to generate knowledge about the epidemiology and seroprevalence of T. gondii, as a basis for developing a surveillance system, we studied the long term seroprevalence over years, farming systems and regions, and seasonal patterns of T. gondii seroprevalence in Dutch slaughter pigs. During a five year study period from 2012 to 2016, serum samples were routinely collected in five Dutch pig slaughterhouses. The sera were tested in an ELISA for the presence of antibodies against Toxoplasma. In total 226,340 serum samples were collected and tested during the study period. The observed seroprevalence varied over years, with the highest overall seroprevalence in 2014 (2.8%) and the lowest in 2016 (1.4%). A higher seroprevalence was observed in pigs from organic farms compared to pigs from conventional farms. The overall risk of infection was on average 2.63 times significantly (p < 0.001) higher for organically raised pigs than for conventionally raised pigs. A seasonal pattern in seroprevalence was observed: the results showed a dominant annual periodicity with a seroprevalence peak in winter around week 1 and a minimum seroprevalence in summer around week 27. To our knowledge, this is the first large scale study on the seroprevalence of T. gondii in slaughter pigs. In comparison to other European serological studies, the observed seroprevalence seems to be relatively low. However, care is needed when comparing the results with other studies because of differences in test setup, the number of samples and time period of sampling. The results can be used as a starting point for developing a surveillance system for T. gondii, and for implementation of intervention measures. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={The effect of pour-on eprinomectin administration on milk yield and somatic cell counts was studied in dairy ewes located on twelve farms in mainland Greece. On each farm, the selected ewes were randomly divided into three similar groups. Group 1 consisted of 10–15 untreated ewes (control group), Group 2 consisted of 10–13 ewes treated with a single dose of eprinomectin at Day 0 and Group 3 consisted of 6 ewes repeatedly treated with eprinomectin at Days 0, 42 and 70. Faecal egg counts and coprocultures were performed on Days 0, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84 and 98. The milk yield and somatic cell counts were measured. The topically administered eprinomectin was highly effective against gastrointestinal nematodes up to 42 days post treatment (94.1% and 99.7% for Groups 2 and 3, respectively). This beneficial effect was extended from Day 42 to 98, in ewes of Group 3. Ewes treated once or thrice presented an increase of daily milk yield by ca. 5% (50 mL/day) and 11% (105 mL/day), respectively, compared to untreated ewes. At the same frame, a significant decrease in somatic cell counts was observed in the eprinomectin treated ewes compared to the untreated ones. In conclusion, this study confirmed the high antiparasitic efficacy and the beneficial effect of pour-on eprinomectin on the milk yield and somatic cell counts in dairy ewes under semi-intensive management. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Nematodes of the genus Ascaridia are known to infect many species of birds and result in fatal diseases. A. galli damages the intestinal mucosa of chickens leading to blood loss, secondary infection and occasionally the obstruction of small intestines due to high worm burden. This study investigated the gene expression profiles in chickens from two different provinces of South Africa naturally exposed to A. galli infestations and tested either positive or negative for the parasite. The study further investigated gene expression profiles of the A. galli infected duodenum, jejunum and ileum tissues of the small intestines. The A. galli positive intestines displayed hypertrophy of the intestinal villi with accumulation of inflammatory cells and necrosis of the crypts of Lieberkühn glands, lesions that were absent in the uninfected intestines. Total RNA isolated from small intestines of infected and non-infected intestines was sequenced using Illumina HiSeq technology to generate up to 23,856,130 reads. Between any two-way comparisons of the intestines, 277 and 190 transcripts were significantly expressed in Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) chickens, respectively. Gene ontology analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed an enrichment of genes reported to function in the immune response, defense response, inflammatory response and cell signalling genes. T cell receptor signalling pathways and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways were among the most significantly impacted pathways. Overall, the study provided insights into adaptative mechanisms for chickens extensively raised in parasite infected environments. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Nucleation is an important wet granulation rate process that sometimes has a profound effect on granule attributes and which needs to be captured in process modelling studies. However, existing models fail to predict nuclei size distribution of a range of spray conditions typically used in industry. In this paper, the dimensionless nucleation number Ψn is used to develop two new nuclei size distribution models, one empirical and one semi-mechanistic. The empirical model assumes a log-normal distribution (LND), and the semi-mechanistic model is based on a approach proposed by Hapgood et al. (2009), which applies the Poisson distribution (PD) function. Modelling parameters are estimated using Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) data. From the models, the nuclei size distribution can be easily determined using analytical equations, which simplifies the inclusion in a population balance modelling (PBM) framework. The results of both models are assessed using MCS data as well as experimental data from literature. The empirical LND model is able to capture the MCS results accurately, and the predictions agree reasonably well with the experimental results over a wide range of dimensionless nucleation number (0&lt;Ψn&lt;3). The predictions of the semi-mechanistic modified Poisson distribution (MPD) model do not agree qualitatively with the MCS or experimental results. A sensitivity analysis shows that the MCS modelling assumptions need to capture the spatial drop distribution in the spray accurately, while the drop size distribution can be assumed to be uniform. Overall, we recommend that the LND model with the parameter values estimated be used in PBM frameworks to determine nuclei size distribution for a wide range of experimental conditions in mixers and fluidised granulators. © 2019},

abstract={Dynamics of gas-liquid two-phase flow in parallel microchannels is the bottleneck to be solved during numbering-up. This paper focuses on the stability and distribution of gas-liquid two-phase flow in asymmetric parallel microchannels. Nitrogen and glycerol-water solutions are used as the gas and liquid phases respectively. The stability of bubble formation is better under higher flow rates of gas and liquid phases. When the flow rate ratio of gas and liquid phases is smaller, the uniformity of bubbles is better. The design of cavities in the microchannel degrades stability, while results in better uniformity. The uniformity of the bubble size is the best in the microchannel configuration with both cavities in the front and the rear. The predictive models of the relative deviation E(L), representing the uniformity of bubbles, are proposed according to the principle of conservation of pressure drop and the resistance relationship in the parallel microchannels. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Canine vector-borne infections gained in importance in Germany due to growing tourist traffic, the increased import of dogs from abroad and the changing of climatic conditions. The Mediterranean region and southeastern Europe are geographical areas where pathogens such as Leishmania (L.) infantum, Hepatozoon (H.) canis, Ehrlichia (E.) canis, Anaplasma (A.) platys and Dirofilaria (D.) spp. are endemic. Meanwhile, Babesia (B.) spp. and A. phagocytophilum are present in central and western Europe. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate whether dogs were exposed to a corresponding risk of infection when travelling to regions in the Mediterranean area and southeastern Europe, which are endemic for these pathogens. Medical records and laboratory test results of 303 dogs that travelled to 14 countries endemic for the mentioned canine vector-borne pathogens and that were presented to the Small Animal Clinic at Freie Universität Berlin between 2007 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 1174 test results from external laboratories were descriptively analysed including 525 test results of direct and 649 of indirect determination methods. Overall, 13% of the tested dogs (40/303) were positive for at least one pathogen. Concurrent infections with two pathogens were detected in 1% of the dogs (4/303). The positive results were: E. canis 8% (18/231 dogs; Polymerase chain reaction [PCR] 3/73, indirect immunofluorescence test [IFAT] 18/209 dogs), L. infantum 5% (14/260 dogs; PCR 5/80, IFAT or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] 11/251 dogs), Babesia spp. 5% (11/232 dogs; Babesia spp. PCR 3/127, B. canis/vogeli IFAT or ELISA 8/160, B. gibsoni IFAT 2/22), Dirofilaria spp. 1% (1/133 dogs; D. immitis antigen-ELISA 1/117, microfilariae PCR 0/16, Knott´s test 0/69 dogs). None of the dogs has been tested positive in a combined Babesia spp./Hepatozoon spp. PCR test (0/15 dogs) and for H. canis (0/17 dogs; PCR) or A. platys (0/11 dogs; PCR). There is a substantial risk for dogs travelling to areas endemic for vector-borne pathogens even with limited time of exposure to get infected. The data indicates the importance of owner education and prophylactic measurements against vector-borne infections in dogs travelling to endemic areas. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Cyclophilins (CyPs) are ubiquitous proteins involved in a wide variety of processes including protein maturation and trafficking, receptor complex stabilization, apoptosis, receptor signaling, RNA processing, and spliceosome assembly. The ubiquitous presence is justified by their peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity, catalyzing the rotation of X-Pro peptide bonds from a cis to a trans conformation, a critical rate-limiting step in protein folding, as over 90% of proteins contain trans prolyl imide bonds. In Arabidopsis 35 CyPs involved in plant development have been reported, showing different subcellular localizations and tissue- and stage-specific expression. In the present work, we focused on the localization of CyPs in pear (Pyrus communis) pollen, a model system for studies on pollen tube elongation and on pollen-pistil self-incompatibility response. Fluorescent, confocal and immuno-electron microscopy showed that this protein is present in the cytoplasm, organelles and cell wall, as confirmed by protein fractionation. Moreover, an 18-kDa CyP isoform was specifically released extracellularly when pear pollen was incubated with the Ca2+ chelator EGTA. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={A mixture of persistent organic pollutants relevant to human exposure antagonized the transcriptional activity of the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor in vitro, whose activity could be predicted. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd
While humans are exposed to mixtures of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), their risk assessment is usually based on a chemical-by-chemical approach. To assess the health effects associated with mixed exposures, knowledge on mixture toxicity is required. Several POPs are potential ligands of the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which involves in xenobiotic metabolism and controls many biological pathways. This study assesses AhR agonistic and antagonistic activities of 29 POPs individually and in mixtures by using Chemical-Activated LUciferase gene eXpression bioassays with 3 transgenic cell lines (rat hepatoma DR-H4IIE, human hepatoma DR-Hep G2 and human mammary gland carcinoma DR-T47-D). Among the 29 POPs, which were selected based on their abundance in Scandinavian human blood, only 4 exerted AhR agonistic activities, while 16 were AhR antagonists in DR-H4IIE, 5 in DR-Hep G2 and 7 in DR-T47-D when tested individually. The total POP mixture revealed to be AhR antagonistic. It antagonized EC50 TCDD inducing AhR transactivation at a concentration of 125 and 250 and 500 fold blood levels in DR-H4IIE, DR-T47-D and DR-Hep G2, respectively, although each compound was present at these concentrations lower than their LOEC values. Such values could occur in real-life in food contamination incidents or in exposed populations. In DR-H4IIE, the antagonism of the total POP mixture was due to chlorinated compounds and, in particular, to PCB-118 and PCB-138 which caused 90% of the antagonistic activity in the POP mixture. The 16 active AhR antagonists acted additively. Their mixed effect was predicted successfully by concentration addition or generalized concentration addition models, rather than independent action, with only two-fold IC50 underestimation. We also attained good predictions for the full dose-response curve of the antagonistic activity of the total POP mixture. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Cattle trypanosomosis caused by Trypanosoma vivax is a widely distributed disease in Africa and Latin America. It causes significant losses in the livestock industry and is characterized by fluctuating parasitemia, anemia, fever, lethargy, and weight loss. In this study we evaluated the virulence (capacity to multiply inside the host and to modulate the host response) and pathogenicity (ability to produce disease and/or mortality) patterns of two T. vivax strains (TvMT1 and TvLIEM176) in experimentally-infected sheep and determined the proteins differentially expressed in the proteomes of these two strains. Hematological and clinical parameters were monitored in experimentally-infected versus non-infected sheep for 60 days. All the infected animals developed discernable parasitemia at 3 days post-infection (dpi), and the first parasitemia peak was observed at 6 dpi. The maximum average value of parasitemia was 1.3 × 107 (95% CI, 7.9 × 105–2 × 108) parasites/ml in TvLIEM176-infected animals, and 2.5 × 106 (95% CI, 1.6 × 105–4 × 107) parasites/ml in TvMT1-infected ones. Anemia and clinical manifestations were more severe in the animals infected by TvMT1 strain than in those infected by TvLIEM176. In the proteomic analysis, a total of 29 proteins were identified, of which 14 exhibited significant differences in their expression levels between strains. Proteins with higher expression in TvLIEM176 were: alpha tubulin, beta tubulin, arginine kinase, glucose-regulated protein 78, paraflagellar protein 3, and T-complex protein 1 subunit theta. Proteins with higher expression in TvMT1 were: chaperonin HSP60, T-complex protein 1 subunit alpha, heat shock protein 70, pyruvate kinase, glycerol kinase, inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase, 73 kDa paraflagellar rod protein, and vacuolar ATP synthase. There was a difference in the virulence and pathogenicity between the T. vivax strains: TvLIEM176 showed high virulence and moderate pathogenicity, whereas TvMT1 showed low virulence and high pathogenicity. The proteins identified in this study are discussed for their potential involvement in strains’ virulence and pathogenicity, to be further defined as biomarkers of severity in T. vivax infections. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Activated carbon is the most common electrode material used in electrosorption processes such as water desalination with capacitive deionization (CDI). CDI is a cyclic process to remove ions from aqueous solutions by transferring charge from one electrode to another. When multiple salts are present in a solution, the removal of each ionic species can be different, resulting in selective ion separations. This ion selectivity is the result of combined effects, such as differences in the hydrated size and valence of the ions. In the present work, we study ion selectivity from salt mixtures with two different monovalent ions, chloride and nitrate. We run adsorption experiment in microporous carbons (i.e., without applying a voltage), as well as electrosorption experiments (i.e., based on applying a voltage between two carbon electrodes). Our results show that i) during adsorption and electrosorption, activated carbon removes much more nitrate than chloride; ii) at equilibrium, ion selectivity does not depend strongly on the composition of the water, but does depend on charging voltage in CDI; and iii) during electrosorption, ion selectivity is time-dependent. We modify the amphoteric Donnan model by including an additional affinity of nitrate to carbon. We find good agreement between our experimental results and the theory. Both show very high selectivity towards nitrate over chloride, βNO3 −/Cl− ∼10, when no voltage is applied, or when the voltage is low. The selectivity gradually decreases with increasing charging voltage to βNO3 −/Cl− ∼6 at Vch = 1.2 V. Despite this decrease, the affinity-effect for nitrate continues to play an important role also at a high voltage. In general, we can conclude that our work provides new insights in the importance of carbon-ion interactions for electrochemical water desalination. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Plant carotenoid cleavage oxygenase (CCO) is an enzyme which catalyzes carotenoids to apocarotenoid products that are involved in several vital physiological functions. The CCO exists in two forms, namely, CCD (Carotenoid Cleavage Dioxygenase) and NCED (Nine-Cis Epoxycarotenoid Dioxygenase). This paper relates to a comparative study on CCD and NCED genes through phylogeny and codon usage analysis. The result of the phylogenetic analysis indicates a closer relationship between CCD and NCED subclass genes, while the RSCU values indicate a high preference for CUC codon in both CCD and NCED gene families. The mean ENc value of NCED genes was found to be 48.76, suggesting a higher codon bias compared to CCD genes. However, the ENc-GC3S plot suggests that both the gene families are under mutational pressure with variations according to their species-specific role. Similarly, the multivariate analysis also suggests that nucleotide mutation bias influences codon usage. Correlation analysis of Axis I and codon adaptation index values indicate a significant correlation between critical indices. Even though the prominence of the variations in codon usage between the two gene families, they are exerted towards the time-specific functional requirement for that plant species. This is evident from the cleaving roles of these enzymes against various carotenoids at different growth stages. The result of this investigation indicates that CCD and NCED genes are under mutational pressure. This codon bias study paves the way for increasing the production of apocarotenoids, which have a great significance in the industry. © 2019},

abstract={Process-based models are valuable tools for simulating crop production, estimating agronomic efficiency and developing optimum management practices to achieve sustainable agriculture. However, a comparison of the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) and Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) models has not been previously used to optimize management practices for spring maize in northeast China. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the performance of the DSSAT and DNDC models in simulating maize growth and soil C &amp; N dynamics and analyse their weaknesses and strengths based on a 7-year spring maize study in northeast China; and to explore the optimal management practices for improving maize production and nitrogen use efficiency under 20-year climate variability. Both DNDC and DSSAT exhibited “good” to “excellent” performance in simulating maize yield, above-ground biomass and plant N uptake for ecological intensification with N fertilizer (EI-N) and farmers’ practice with N fertilizer (FP-N) treatments based on percent bias (PBIAS) of −10.5–4.2%, a normalized root mean squared error (nRMSE) of 7.5–17.2%, a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.17–0.77 and a d index of agreement (d) of 0.81–0.94. Both models showed “fair” to “good” performance in the same simulation for EI without N fertilizer (EI-N0) and FP without N fertilizer (FP-N0) treatments, but the maize yield simulation was better for the DSSAT model. In addition, the two models provided “fair” performance for N-fertilized treatments to “poor” performance for N-unfertilized treatments in simulations of soil organic carbon (0–0.20 m) and mineral N (0–0.30 m), but the simulations were better for the DNDC model. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the optimum yield and agronomic efficiency were achieved at a planting date of late April to early May, a fertilizer N application rate of 180–210 kg N ha−1 with two timing splits in the DNDC and DSSAT model and a planting density of 7 seeds m−2 in the DSSAT model. This study suggests that comparing the management scenarios of multiple dynamic models is more beneficial to develop best management practices for improving crop production and fertilizer use efficiency. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Starting from coupled Boltzmann-Enskog (BE) kinetic equations for a two-particle system consisting of hard spheres, a hyperbolic two-fluid model for binary, hard-sphere mixtures is derived with separate mean velocities and energies for each phase. In addition to spatial transport, the BE kinetic equations account for particle-particle collisions, using an elastic hard-sphere collision model, and the Archimedes (buoyancy) force due to spatial gradients of the pressure in each phase, as well as other forces involving spatial gradients (e.g. lift). In the derivation, the particles in a given phase have identical mass and volume, and have no internal degrees of freedom (i.e. the particles are adiabatic). The 'hard-sphere-fluid' phase is obtained in the limit where the particle diameter in one phase tends to zero with fixed phase density so that the number of fluid particles tends to infinity. The moment system resulting from the two BE kinetic equations is closed at second order by invoking the anisotropic Gaussian closure. The resulting two-fluid model for a binary, hard-sphere mixture therefore consists (for each phase ) of transport equations for the mass , mean momentum (where is the velocity) and a symmetric, second-order, kinetic energy tensor . The trace of the fluctuating energy tensor is where is the phase temperature (or granular temperature). Thus, is the total kinetic energy, the sum over of which is the total kinetic energy of the system, a conserved quantity. From the analysis, it is found that the BE finite-size correction leads to exact phase pressure (or stress) tensors that depend on the mean-slip velocity , as well as the phase temperatures for both phases. These pressure tensors also appear in the momentum-exchange terms in the mean momentum equations that produce the Archimedes force, as well as drag contributions due to fluid compressibility and a lift force due to mean fluid-velocity gradients. The closed BE energy flux tensors show a similar dependence on the mean-slip velocity. The characteristic polynomial of the flux matrix from the one-dimensional model is computed symbolically and depends on five parameters: the particle volume fractions , , the phase density ratio , the phase temperature ratio and the mean-slip Mach number . By applying Sturm's Theorem to the characteristic polynomial, it is demonstrated that the model is hyperbolic over a wide range of these parameters, in particular, for the physically most relevant values. © 2019 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={The temperature-dependent liquid structures of Co-B melts were studied by in-situ measuring the magnetization. A magnetization anomaly in term of the non-Curie-Weiss temperature dependence of magnetization was observed in the overheated state, demonstrating a temperature-induced liquid-liquid structure transition. This anomalous behavior was found to be a universal formula for the Co-B binary alloy system. The transition point (T0) and two paramagnetic Curie temperatures (θp(LI), θp(LII)) corresponding to two distinct kinds of liquids (i.e., high-magnetization liquid (HML) I and low-magnetization liquid (LML) II) were measured. With the increased concentration of Co, T0, θp(LI) and θp(LII) shift to higher temperatures and the Curie constants for the HML and LML decrease. Based on the location of T0, a guideline is drawn above the liquidus in the Co-B phase diagram, which could provide a significant guidance to the practical melt treatment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this work, a series of germanium–sulfur (Ge[sbnd]S) chalcogenide glasses (ChGs) was prepared. The third-order optical nonlinear (TONL) properties of ChGs were measured using Z-scan technique at 800 nm. A rapid decrease of optical bandgap energy (Eopg) and rapid increase of nonlinear refractive index (n2) were observed at a mean coordination number (MCN) of 2.67, which is known as the second topological threshold. Raman spectra showed that the appearance of [Ge(Ge2S2)] tetrahedra in the glass network is responsible for the decrease of Eopg at the threshold MCN and the significant enhancement to the TONL properties of the Ge[sbnd]S ChGs. © 2019},

abstract={The effect of the membrane surface on the oxygen permeation performances is not studied to sufficient detail in the literature. However, this paper shows that the roughness, and the surface physico-chemistry can have a large effect on the oxygen semi-performances of the membrane, in particular on the kinetics of oxygen exchanges at the surface of the mixed electronic and ionic conductors. For instance, the kinetic coefficient of oxygen surface exchanges can increase by more than one order of magnitude in relation with the surface roughness for La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.7Ga0.3O3-δ perovskite-type membrane. Then, the best oxygen fluxes obtained in this work, i.e. 3.9 10−3 mol m−2 s−1, are close to the best performances reported in the literature for a dense 1 mm in thick membrane. Finally, some assumptions are discussed and argued in detail to explain the effect of the surface of the La0.5Sr0.5Fe0.7Ga0.3O3-δ perovskite membrane on their oxygen semi-permeation performances. © 2019},

abstract={In this research paper, a hybrid solar desalination system has been employed. The hybrid solar desalination system includes photovoltaic thermal panels, solar dish concentrator, and humidification-dehumidification desalination unit. The humidification-dehumidification desalination unit comprises a closed-air open-water flow configuration, and the solar dish concentrators are utilized for water heating. Examination of three different shapes of cavity receiver including cylindrical, cubical and hemispherical, as the solar dish absorbers, was carried out. Thermal oil was considered as the solar working fluid. The absorbed solar heat was transferred to the desalination unit using a heat exchanger. In the hybrid solar desalination, photovoltaic panels were used to generate the required power. Water flow was considered at the back of the photovoltaic panels for preheating and improving the photovoltaic efficiency. The principal aim of the current study is to propose hybrid solar desalination system to generate power, and produce freshwater. The solar desalination's performance was examined in terms of various solar dish parameters and different humidification-dehumidification desalination parameters. Examination of various solar dish parameters, including the solar working fluid's inlet temperature and the cavity shapes, was carried out. Also, some humidification-dehumidification desalination parameters, including the water to air flow ratio and the water flow rate, were considered. The effects of these four parameters were investigated on the water production and the gain output ratio. Based on the results, it was found that there was an increase in the production of freshwater by raising the water flow rate, decreasing the solar working fluid inlet temperature and increasing the air flow rate. Besides, there was an increase in the gain output ratio by increasing the water flow rate, increasing the inlet temperature, and increasing the air flow rate. Finally, the highest freshwater production and lowest gain output ratio were resulted by the hemispherical cavity receiver. © 2019},

abstract={JLX001, a novel compound with similar structure with cyclovirobuxine D (CVB-D), has been proved to exert therapeutical effects on permanent focal cerebral ischemia. However, the protective effects of JLX001 on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and its anti-apoptotic effects have not been reported. We investigated the efficacy of JLX001 in two pharmacodynamic tests (pre-treatment test and post-treatment) with rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R). The pharmacodynamic tests demonstrated that JLX001 ameliorated I/R injury by reducing infarct sizes and brain edema. The results of Morris water maze, neurological scores, cylinder test and posture reflex test implied that JLX001 improved the learning, memory and motor ability after MCAO/R in the long term. Anti-apoptotic effects of JLX001 and its regulation of cytosolic c-Jun N-terminal Kinases (JNKs) signal pathway were confirmed in vivo by co-immunofluorescence staining and western immunoblotting. Furthermore, primary cortical neuron cultures were prepared and exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) for in vitro studies. Cytotoxicity test and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) test showed that JLX001 enhanced cell survival rate and maintained MMP. Flow cytometry and TdT-mediated dUTP-X nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining demonstrated the anti-apoptotic effects of JLX001 in vitro. Likewise, JLX001 regulated JNK signal pathway in vivo, which was also confirmed by western immunoblotting. Collectively, this study presents the first evidence that JLX001 exerted protective effects against I/R injury by reducing neuronal apoptosis via down-regulating JNK signaling pathway. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Microplastics (MPs, &lt;5 mm in size) are classified as emerging contaminants but treatment processes are not designed to remove these small particles. Wastewater treatment systems have been proposed as pathways for MPs pollution to receiving waters but quantitative and qualitative data on MP occurrence and transport remains limited, hindering risk assessment and regulation. Here, for the first time, the stepwise abundance and loading of MPs (60–2800 μm) in a tertiary wastewater treatment plant in the UK was assessed by sampling from May 2017 to February 2018. Microplastics were found in all sampling campaigns, with an average inflow of 8.1 × 108 (95% CI, 3.8 × 108 to 1.2 × 109) items day−1. Their prevalence decreased from influent to final effluent. Overall abundances decreased on average by 6%, 68%, 92%, and 96% after the pre-treatment, primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment stages respectively, although considerable variability occurred throughout the year. Sufficient particles remained in the treated effluent to generate an average discharge of 2.2 × 107 (95% CI, 1.2 × 107 to 3.2 × 107]) particles day−1 to the recipient river. Secondary MPs were predominant, while primary MP abundances were minimal. Fibres comprised 67% of all items, followed by films (18%) and fragments (15%). Chemical characterisation confirmed the presence of different types of polymers, with polypropylene fibres and fragments most abundant (23%). This research informs understanding of how wastewater effluent may channel MPs to the natural environment and their composition, and helps understand control points for optimising advanced treatment processes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Drinking water discoloration is one of the most common customer complaints. The accumulation of residual manganese (Mn) in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) accounts for part of the discolored water that reaches household taps. Field studies were conducted at seven full-scale DWDS to investigate the deposition and release behaviors of Mn in different forms and at different concentrations in finished water. The results show that particulate Mn tended to accumulate in DWDS even at concentrations as low as 10 μg/L. The oxidation of soluble Mn(II) ions in DWDS was highly affected by water chemistries as well as water age; 10 μg/L of soluble Mn could still transform into particulate Mn under suitable conditions. When total Mn concentration in finished water was below 5 μg/L, erosion of Mn deposits occurred in DWDS with a Mn deposit inventory. Soluble Mn release was observed when chlorine or chlorine dioxide concentration was lower than 0.1 mg/L, and the release was speculated to be a result of microbial reductive dissolution of Mn oxides. Ensuring the total Mn concentration is below 10 μg/L and decreasing the particulate Mn concentration to 5 μg/L in finished water are both recommended to minimize Mn accumulation risk in DWDS. Enhanced oxidation and filtration for Mn removal during water treatment processes are proposed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={A single workflow based on three approaches (target, suspected and non-target screening) using liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) in data independent acquisition mode (DIA) was developed to assess the presence of emerging pollutants (EPs) in water and sediments from a Mediterranean River Basin. Identification of potential contaminants was based on mass accuracy, isotopic ratio pattern, theoretical fragmentation, and retention time using Waters UNIFI software. In the suspect screening against a library containing 2200 components, 68 contaminants were tentatively identified, 6 of which were confirmed and quantified with analytical standards. Non-target screening (NTS) required additional manual processing and the aid of an on-line database (ChemSpider) to tentatively identify compounds. Eprosartan, an antihypertensive drug not included in the library used for suspected screening, was confirmed and semi-quantified. The identification of Eprosartan proved the workflow to be functional for NTS. Target screening of 171 pesticides and 33 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) including the compounds confirmed using suspect (6) and non target (1) screening achieved monitoring of the most abundant contaminants from the head to the mouth of the Turia basin to establish their spatial distribution. QTOF-MS screening versatility with its high-resolution capability allows for a comprehensive assessment of EPs in the aquatic environment. © 2019},

abstract={Biofouling is a persistent and unmet challenge in reverse osmosis (RO) technology. The attachment of microorganisms on the membrane surface has severely deteriorated the performance of RO membranes hence significantly affected the overall productivity and energy consumption of the system. Different strategies have been established to mitigate the thorny issue in order to minimize the adverse impacts of biofouling. This contribution provides a comprehensive review on the contemporary strategies that are focused on RO membrane design and modification to address the biofouling issues. The strategies for the development of anti-biofouling RO membrane in terms of material characteristics and selections as well as the techniques established to render anti-biofouling properties are extensively discussed. The performance of RO membranes through approaches including coating, layer by layer, grafting immobilization and surface patterning are reviewed. Finally, this review is wrapped up with the technological issues and challenges as well as the future perspective of these strategies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Helichrysum italicum (Roth) G. Don is a thermophilus perennial from family Asteraceae. Due to versatile biological activities and applications, the interest in Helichrysum italicum scientific research and use has increased in the last couple of decades. Consequently, due to the increased industrial demand its plantation farming experienced a huge expansion in Eastern European Mediterranean countries. The aim of this review article was to present the available data on Helichrysum italicum and to identify the gaps in the knowledge, and openings for future potential investigations and contributions to the topic. The review of the Scopus database was performed and scientific studies from 1990 to the most recent publications in 2019 were summarized. The article includes the last reviewed taxonomy, detailed description of morphological characteristics, geographical distribution, uses, chemical diversity, biological activity (antimicrobial, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, repellent, and insecticidal activity), and genetic diversity. Additionally, some other potential uses are described. The majority of the available scientific data is focused on the chemical composition of the essential oil, however, little is known about the cultivation management of Helichrysum italicum that includes sowing requirements, seedling production, plant density, fertilization and nutrition requirements, harvesting, diseases, insects, and weed control. Genetic information on Helichrysum italicum is also scarce, but needed for future breeding programs of Helichrysum italicum and selection of new cultivars. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The photoelastic constant of nominal molar compositions RO(R'2O3)–SiO2 (R = Pb, R' = Sb, Bi) decreases with increasing RO and R'2O3, which is in agreement with calculations based on the quantitative structural information of silicate tetrahedra determined by 29Si MAS-NMR. Compositional dependence of the photoelastic property is attributed to the electronic polarizabilities of the constituent ions. To understand the relationship between the structure and photoelastic response, the reported electronic polarizability is modified to match the value that includes the observed density and refractive index based on Lorentz–Lorenz eq. A composition of photoelastic glass with zero photoelastic constant is identified by an empirical equation that provides the ratio of the metal‑oxygen bond length to the coordination number. Our finding is that the compositional response in the photoelastic constant is due to the variation in the electronic polarizability, despite the different ns2-type metal cations incorporated in the silicate glass. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

This EAA Reservoir project was included by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in a 2018 U.S. Congressional bill that was approved. In May 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to spend $200 million to begin construction of this restoration, three times the amount requested by the state of Florida. While supported with enthusiasm by the Florida state legislature, the SFWMD, and some NGOs such as The Everglades Foundation, a change in leadership in the state of Florida after November 2018 elections and especially in the leadership of the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) has led to a renewed public optimism for major improvements in water quality management in south Florida. It is therefore timely for this review of the advantages and shortcomings of this “EAA (Everglades Agricultural Area) Reservoir Plan” to be widely disseminated in an international forum such as Ecological Engineering to encourage discussions among scientists and engineers. © 2019},

The left front parietal lobe was used as the area of interest for this experimental study. One-centimeter cube polyurethane foam was injected 2-cm deep inside the brain tissue using a plastic injection tube. After 5 minutes, the model was ready to use under the operating microscope for dissection, separation, and removal of the tumor tissue. The compatibility of the training model also was evaluated as poor, acceptable, and perfect. Results: Ten stripped fresh cadaveric cow brains were used in this experimental feasibility study. The compatibility of the model was evaluated as poor, acceptable, and perfect in 1, 6, and 3 subjects, respectively. Conclusions: In intrinsic brain tumor ablation, surgical manipulations of sulcal, cisternal, and fissural dissection must be undertaken while preserving vital neural and vascular structures. We believe that our model holds promise in developing the technical skills of neurosurgeons in training. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Background: Hemangiomas are benign blood vessels tumors that represent less than 1% of all the bone neoplasms. Calvarial hemangiomas are mainly solitary lesions commonly located in the frontal and parietal bone; however, they may occur in any skull region. These tumors increase in size over a period of months to years before they start showing their first symptoms such as headache, bone deformity, and pathological fractures. Differential diagnosis with osteosarcoma should be considered. Surgical resection with a safety margin is a standard treatment of the cranial hemangioma. Furthermore, radiotherapy has proven to stop the tumor's growth but not its size. Case Description: We treated an 11-year-old male who had a rare case of a capillary hemangioma located in the clivus bone. The patient underwent 2 endoscopic endonasal resection because of tumor recurrence. Surgical safety margins are highly recommended, but this procedure could not be performed because of the tumor's location. After the second relapse, the oncology team decided to initiate radiotherapy. At 6-month follow-up, the tumor reduced its size and remained unchanged. Conclusions: Surgical safety margins are highly important to prevent recurrence in this type of bone tumors. Skull base hemangiomas are a big challenge when you want to achieve these safety margins. We believe that a combined treatment of surgery and radiotherapy should be considered as the main treatment. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: Late-onset skull base cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage after stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is a very rare complication. Case Description: A 54-year-old woman came to our department for convulsions and was admitted. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a giant tumor in the skull base region, including the sphenoid sinus, pituitary fossa, right cavernous sinus, right middle fossa, and right basal ganglia. Mild left hemiparesis was noted. An ophthalmologic examination revealed left side homonymous hemianopsia. Using an endonasal endoscopic surgical approach, tumor removal was performed, with the residual tumor removed with a transcranial approach. Residual tumor tissue remained around the right cavernous sinus; therefore, SRT was performed 1 month after the second procedure, which resulted in good control of growth. Four years later, spontaneous CSF leakage occurred, for which endoscopic endonasal surgery was performed. One month later, CSF leakage recurred, and the same procedure was again used. A third episode of recurrent CSF leakage occurred 5 days later. A transcranial approach was finally used for repair, and the patient showed complete recovery. Conclusions: Late-onset CSF leakage after SRT for a pituitary adenoma can be intractable, and several aggressive repair procedures may be needed, including a combination of endonasal and transcranial approaches. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={A selective and sensitive electrochemical sensor for recognition of profenofos (PFF) was fabricated based on the drop coating of synthesized molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) and graphene oxide (GO) on the surface of glassy carbon (GCE). The imprinted layer was systematically characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Electro chemical studies were conducted with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) through a “gate-controlled” effect using [Fe (CN)6] 3-/4- as a probe. Under optimal condition, the modified GCE exhibited linear calibration curve for PFF over a concentration range from 5 × 10−8 to 35 × 10−4 M with a detection limit of 5 nM. The proposed procedure has many advantages such as; high precision, long-term stability and enhanced sensitivity towards PFF compared other pesticide family members. As an application, the proposed sensor has been applied for determination of PFF in real vegetables and spiked water samples with satisfactory results. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={A lectin receptor, CLEC5A, plays an important role in the pathogenic mechanism of dengue virus (DV). The binding affinity between the DV envelope E-protein and CLEC5A is extremely weak and not easily detected using traditional methods, such as ELISA, making the characterization of the binding epitope even more difficult. Therefore, an efficient sensing method for weak binding detection is needed. We propose a novel sensing scheme with an electrode structure of a uniformly distributed nano-hemisphere array that enables multivalent interactions between the viral E-protein and its receptor for effective detection of weak binding. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), which belongs to the same flavivirus genus as DV, was used as a model to investigate the binding epitope between viral E-protein and CLEC5A. To study the influence of glycosylation on the binding, point mutations of JEV E-protein were introduced on amino acids D67 and N154 to gain or lose glycosylation on each site. The glycosylation on D67 of the JEV E-protein is critical for virus-CLEC5A interactions. However, the glycosylation on N154 hinders the interaction between D67 and CLEC5A, reducing the binding affinity between the virus and CLEC5A. The proposed approach provides an effective biosensor method for determining the binding epitope between a virus and CLEC5A. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Humidification–dehumidification technology is an innovative desalination technology which is promising for small-scale desalination applications. The relative low energy efficiency made the early system less competitive. Multi-stage humidification–dehumidification technology is one of the approaches that effectively improve the system energy efficiency. In this study, an air extraction/injection two-stage humidification–dehumidification system with reflux configuration is proposed. The reflux configuration is introduced into the two-stage system to improve the energy efficiency by eliminating the difference between the air temperatures at the extraction and injection points. A thermodynamic model is developed to investigate the system performance. It is found that the air temperatures at the extraction and injection points are only identical when the pinch point heat capacity rate ratio of first-stage dehumidifier less than unity and that of second-stage dehumidifier greater than unity. The influence of liquid-to-air mass flow rate ratio in the second stage on the energy efficiency of the system is negligible when the pinch point heat capacity rate ratio of first-stage and second-stage dehumidifier both greater than unity. The energy efficiency peaks when the pinch point heat capacity rate ratio of first-stage or second-stage dehumidifier equals unity. Additionally, the reflux configuration can improve the energy efficiency of two-stage system by 30%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Understanding the protein-secretion dynamics from single, specific tissues is critical toward the advancement of disease detection and treatments. However, such secretion dynamics remain difficult to measure in vivo due to the uncontrolled contributions from other tissue populations. Here, we describe an integrated platform designed for the reliable, near real-time measurements of cytokines secreted from an in vitro single-tissue model. In our setup, we grow 3D biomimetic tissues to discretize cytokine source, and we separate them from a magnetic microbead-based biosensing system using a Transwell insert. This design integrates physiochemically controlled biological activity, high-sensitivity protein detection (LOD &lt; 20 pg mL−1), and rapid protein diffusion to enable non-invasive, near real-time measurements. To showcase the specificity and sensitivity of the system, we use our setup to probe the inflammatory process related to the protein Interleukine 6 (IL-6) and to the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-α). We show that our setup can monitor the time-dependence profile of IL-6 and TNF-α secretion that results from the electrical and chemical stimulation of 3D skeletal muscle tissues. We demonstrate a novel and affordable methodology for discretizing the secretion kinetics of specific tissues for advancing metabolic-disorder studies and drug-screening applications. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is widely used; however, most of the prior studies have resulted in presurgical decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) values in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). We used ZOOM DTI and could acquire highly accurate FA values during perioperative periods, which indicated different insights than preceding studies. The objective of this study was to assess the perioperative FA change in patients with CSM and determine the prognostic factor. Methods: Twenty-eight patients with CSM and healthy control subjects were enrolled in this study. Twenty patients (71%) had intracordal high intensity before surgery. All patients underwent decompressive surgery. ZOOM DTI and the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) assessment were performed before and after surgery. The region of interest was manually contoured to omit the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid. The axial plane of the most stenotic cervical level was assessed. Results: FA values before surgery and at 1 week after surgery, and FA values at 1 week after surgery and at 6 months after surgery differed significantly as determined. The FA values of patients with intracordal high intensity significantly decreased after surgery and significantly increased from 1 week to 6 months, whereas those of patients without intracordal high intensity did not significantly change. JOA scores at 6 months after surgery (13.1) improved significantly compared with JOA scores before surgery (10.8). Only FA values at 1 week after surgery had a significant positive relationship with JOA scores presurgery and at 6 months after surgery. Conclusions: The presurgical FA value in patients with CSM did not differ from that of normal control subjects, but significantly decreased after surgery, and significantly increased 6 months after surgery. We concluded that the postsurgical FA value approximates the proper state of the damaged cord and the presurgical FA value includes a masked effect as an aligned fiber effect because of compression by degenerative construction. Only the FA value at 1 week had a significant positive relationship with the JOA score presugery and at 6 months, which established that the postsurgical FA value may be a more accurate prognostic factor than the presurgical FA value. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Source-receptor relationships (SRRs) are simplified air quality models. They are usually used to replace fully-fledged Chemical Transport models (CTMs) when simulating a huge number of emission reduction scenarios, in policy-related contexts. Even if SRRs do not contain the same richness of information as CTMs (i.e. in terms of spatial/temporal resolution) and are merely a statistical approximation of the original models, their application is usually deemed to be sufficient in the policy arena, when a condensed (i.e. yearly average concentrations instead of hourly detailed ones) representation of the real scenarios is required; and when “simulation time” is a constraint (as i.e. optimization processes). In this paper we identify and validate SRRs, based on the EMEP MSC-W Chemical Transport Model. The proposed statistical SRR approach is implemented using a limited number of CTM simulations. Also, it allows for a flexible selection of the emission reduction scenarios to be simulated, both from a geographical and a sectoral point of view. The validation results, performed on various domains and sectors, demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be used in a policy context, even if certain limitations on its use needs to be recognized. © 2019},

abstract={In the present work, venoms from five species of the genus Agkistrodon were evaluated in terms of their enzymatic (Phospholipase A2 and caseinolytic) and biological (edema forming, hemorrhagic, procoagulant and lethal) effects. Horses were used to produce monovalent hyperimmune sera against each of three venoms (A. bilineatus, A. contortrix and A. piscivorus) and their neutralizing potency, expressed as Median Effective Dose (ED50), was determined against the venoms of all five species. In terms of PLA2 and caseinolytic activities, all venoms are extremely homogeneous. PLA2 activity is high, while caseinolytic activity is low when in contrast with that of the rattlesnake Crotalus simus. On the other hand, biological activities showed marked interspecific differences, particularly between the species from Mexico and those from the United States. Mexican species displayed higher edema-forming, hemorrhagic and lethal effects than US species, while none of the species studied presented procoagulant activity. All three monovalent hyperimmune sera showed good neutralizing potency against the analyzed venoms. Nonetheless, we observed relevant immunochemical differences among the venoms using ELISA and Western Blot assays. We conclude that the venoms of A. piscivorus (USA) and A. bilineatus would be ideal to use as immunogens for the production of a polyvalent antivenom with good neutralizing potency against the venoms of all the species of the genus. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={D-dimer is a useful diagnostic biomarker for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, collectively referred to as venous thromboembolism (VTE). The ability to detect in real-time the amount of D-dimer with a fast and reliable method is a key step to anticipate the appearance of these diseases. Here, the results of a highly specific and sensitive biosensor for the detection of D-dimer based on lossy mode resonance in fiber optics are presented. The unique features of specialty fibers in light management integrated with microfluidics allow detecting D-dimer in human serum with a detection limit of 100 ng/mL, a value 5-fold below the clinical cutoff value. Comparison of the results achieved with mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, which allows for the identification of beta- and gamma-chains of fibrinogen, demonstrates the ability of our platform to specifically (>90%) recognize D-dimer. Therefore, this technology potentially represents a paradigm shift in the development of a simple, high-specificity and label-free biosensing platform, which can be applied to speed up diagnostic healthcare processes of venous thromboembolism toward an early diagnostic and personalized treatment system. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Background: Previous studies have shown low rupture rates for small aneurysms (&lt;10 mm), suggesting that the risk of treatment could exceed the benefits. However, evidence has changed, showing crescent rates of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) associated with small aneurysms. We report trends in size, localization, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of intracranial aneurysms (IAs). Methods: In this retrospective study, a total of 200 clinical histories of patients diagnosed with IAs over an 8-year period were analyzed. Variables considered included age, sex, tobacco consumption, morphological characteristics of the aneurysm, complications, vasospasm, and mortality. Qualitative variables were assessed by measurements of absolute and relative frequency. Smoking behavior, aneurysm size, and aneurysm rupture (AR) were compared using 1-way analysis of variance. Categorical variables were analyzed using Pearson's χ2 test. Results: The average age at presentation was 58 years. The average size of ruptured aneurysms in the general group was 2.5–7.5 mm, and AR was most common in women (76%) and in patients age 50–60 years (33%). The rate of vasospasm was 19%, and mortality was 37%. Smokers composed 32% of the cohort. Heavy smokers had a 57% rate of aSAH, with an average size of rupture of 5 mm. The most common location of aneurysms and AR was the AComA (33%). Conclusions: Our results suggest increasing AR rates in aneurysms smaller than 10 mm. This trend is seen especially in individuals with heavy tobacco consumption and in women of perimenopausal age. Our findings show a tendency of AR in accordance with previous results and are expected to serve as basis for further research on aneurysm management. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={A 3D fluid–structure coupling between Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Finite Element (FE) methods is proposed in this paper, with its application to complex tire hydroplaning simulations on rough ground. The purpose of this work is to analyze the SPH–FE coupling capabilities for modeling efficiently such a complex phenomenon. On the fluid side, the SPH method is able to handle the three complex interfaces of the hydroplaning phenomenon: free-surface, ground/fluid and fluid/tire interfaces. On the solid side, the FE method is used for its ability to treat tire–ground contact. A new algorithm dedicated to such SPH–FE coupling strategies is proposed to optimize the computational efficiency through the use of differed time steps between fluid and solid solvers. This way, the number of calls to the FE solver is minimized while maintaining the accuracy and stability of the coupling. The ratio between these respective time steps relies on a control procedure based on pressure loading. The present 3D SPH–FE model is first validated with different academic test cases and experimental data before considering the complex problem of the 3D hydroplaning simulations. Hydroplaning simulations are performed and analyzed on 3D configurations involving both smooth and rough grounds. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Stereotactic neurosurgical procedures carry a risk of intracranial hemorrhage, which may result in significant morbidity and mortality. Vascular imaging is crucial for planning stereotactic procedures to prevent conflicts with intracranial vasculature. There is a wide range of vascular imaging methods used for stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) trajectory planning. Computer-assisted planning (CAP) improves planning time and trajectory metrics. We aimed to quantify the effect of different vascular imaging protocols on CAP trajectories for SEEG. Methods: Ten patients who had undergone SEEG (95 electrodes) following preoperative acquisition of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MR + Gad), magnetic resonance angiography and magnetic resonance angiography (MRV + MRA), and digital subtraction catheter angiography (DSA) were identified from a prospectively maintained database. SEEG implantations were planned using CAP using DSA segmentations as the gold standard. Strategies were then recreated using MRV + MRA and MR + Gad to define the “apparent” and “true” risk scores associated with each modality. Vessels of varying diameter were then iteratively removed from the DSA segmentation to identify the size at which all 3 vascular modalities returned the same safety metrics. Results: CAP performed using DSA vessel segmentations resulted in significantly lower “true” risk scores and greater minimum distances from vasculature compared with the “true” risk associated with MR + Gad and MRV + MRA. MRV + MRA and MR + Gad returned similar risk scores to DSA when vessels <2 mm and <4 mm were not considered, respectively. Conclusions: Significant variability in vascular imaging and trajectory planning practices exist for SEEG. CAP performed with MR + Gad or MRV + MRA alone returns “falsely” lower risk scores compared with DSA. It is unclear whether DSA is oversensitive and thus restricting potential trajectories. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Although plants are often exposed to atmospheric nanoparticles (NPs), the mechanism of NP deposition and their effects on physiology and metabolism, and particularly in combination with other stressors, are not yet understood. Exploring interactions between stressors is particularly important for understanding plant responses in urban environments where elevated temperatures can be associated with air pollution. Accordingly, 3-year-old spruce seedlings were exposed for 2 weeks to aerial cadmium oxide (CdO) NPs of environmentally relevant size (8–62 nm) and concentration (2 × 105 cm−3). While half the seedlings were initially acclimated to high temperature (35 °C) and vapour pressure deficit (VPD; 2.81 kPa), the second half of the plants were left under non-stressed conditions (20 °C, 0.58 kPa). Atomic absorption spectrometry was used to determine Cd content in needles, while gas and liquid chromatography was used to determine changes in primary and secondary metabolites. Photosynthesis-related processes were explored with gas-exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence systems. Our work supports the hypothesis that atmospheric CdO NPs penetrate into leaves but high temperature and VPD reduce such penetration due to stomatal closure. The hypothesis that atmospheric CdO NPs influences physiological and metabolic processes in plants was also confirmed. This impact strengthens with increasing time of exposure. Finally, we found evidence that plants acclimated to stress conditions have different sensitivity to CdO NPs compared to plants not so acclimated. These findings have important consequences for understanding impacts of global warming on plants and indicates that although the effects of elevated temperatures can be deleterious, this may limit other forms of plant stress associated with air pollution. Temperature affects absorption of CdO nanoparticles by spruce seedlings from the air which subsequently influence both physiological and metabolic processes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Post-mining landscapes are examples of large-scale disturbances to ecosystems, and reclamation is of worldwide interest and concern. In central and eastern Europe, coal still plays a key role in the energy mix. In particular, open strip mining strongly influences the disturbance to the Earth's surface and hydrological conditions. Large portions of post-mining sites are reforested because forest restoration establishes the existence of an ecosystem that is sustainable over the long term, which ensures landscape and environmental profits. The success of reforestation depends on the adaptations of the tree species to the newly formed reclaimed mine soils, which are characterised by highly changeable chemical and physical soil properties with significant spatial variability in terms of habitat conditions. Thus, in recent years, interest in tree species selection and adaptation to post-mining sites has grown. This review presents information on the consequences of mining extraction and reclamation management with a special focus on the diversity of mine soil substrates. Examples of soil reconstruction techniques, variation in mine soils and reclaimed sites undergoing reforestation and forest management are discussed based on the usefulness of the tree species commonly used for reclamation in central and eastern Europe, such as Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), European larch (Larix decidua Mill.), European oak (Quercus robus L.) and alders (Alnus ssp.). The species response to mine sites is discussed in terms of tree growth, morphology, biomass, root system reaction and macronutrient supply. The general recommendation is that the introduced reforestation methods should be closely related to the desired quality of soil substrates and shares of species from various functional groups. Pioneering, target and phytomelioration species should be selected not only on the basis of their assumed roles but also according to assessments of the response of these species to the habitat conditions at post-mine sites. © 2019 The Author},

abstract={Reactive oxidized nitrogen species play a central role in environmental pollution, and long term monitoring is widespread. But conventional NOx (defined as NO + NO2) analyzers employing heated converters respond to many species in addition to the compounds NO and NO2. The response of these instruments to nitric acid, peroxyacetyl nitrate, alkyl nitrates and other oxidized nitrogen species (the sum of these plus NOx is defined as NOy) is well established, but the ratio of NOx to NOy varies widely in time and space making the accuracy of commercial NOx monitors uncertain. Care must be taken when comparing spectroscopic measurements of NO2 or numerical models to output from commercial NOx monitors. Correction factors can be developed for specific conditions, and long term trends can be meaningful. Recent studies comparing modeled NOx to measurements with large interferences can involve errors of a factor of two or more and produce misleading guidance on science and policy; the need for rigorous model evaluation adds urgency to the deployment of “true NOx” monitors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The possibility of cultivating the microalga Pseudochloris wilhelmii in low cost media obtained by mixing seawater and secondary wastewaters simulants is investigated for the first time in this work. The obtained results show that, under specific conditions, this microalga is not only capable of growing and producing good quality lipids but might also remove about 80%wt of nitrogen and 70%wt of phosphorus from the medium. Moreover, the obtained lipids would permit producing a good quality biodiesel which could be sold in the market. Experimental results are successfully interpreted by a novel mathematical model which simulates the temporal evolution of biomass and nutrients concentration as well as lipid content and pH by properly taking into account the effects of the main limiting factors, CO2 mass transfer phenomena and solution electro-neutrality. The proposed mathematical model might permit identifying the set of operating conditions which increases biomass and lipid productivity as well as macronutrients removal yields. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.},

Complex assembly might be seeded already during translation, if interacting subunits are recruited to the nascent chain. Here, we review recent discoveries suggesting that such cotranslational assembly is a prominent feature throughout the proteome. It might contribute to the efficiency and efficacy of assembly and occurs in coordination rather than competition with chaperones. We discuss how cotranslational assembly structurally contributes to the organizational order of assembly pathways and their surveillance. Taken together, these novel insights suggest that cotranslational assembly is intimately linked with the regulation of protein abundance, stability, and activity, offering an attractive explanation for many cellular phenomena. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Energy storage based on thermochemical systems is gaining momentum as a potential alternative to molten salts in Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants. This work is a detailed review about the promising integration of a CaCO3/CaO based system, the so-called Calcium-Looping (CaL) process, in CSP plants with tower technology. The CaL process relies on low cost, widely available and non-toxic natural materials (such as limestone or dolomite), which are necessary conditions for the commercial expansion of any energy storage technology at large scale. A comprehensive analysis of the advantages and challenges to be faced for the process to reach a commercial scale is carried out. The review includes a deep overview of reaction mechanisms and process integration schemes proposed in the recent literature. Enhancing the multicycle CaO conversion is a major challenge of the CaL process. Many lab-scale analyses carried out show that residual effective CaO conversion is highly dependent on the process conditions and the CaO precursors used, reaching values in a wide range (0.07–0.82). The selection of the optimal operating conditions must be based on materials performance, process integration, technology and economics aspects. Global plant efficiencies over 45% (without considering solar-side losses) show the interest of the technology. Furthermore, the technological maturity and potential of the process is assessed. The direction towards which future works should be headed is discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Ambient particulate matter (PM) continues to be among the top environmental health concerns globally; in 2017, nearly 3 million deaths were attributed to exposure to PM2.5 around the world (HEI, 2019). While much attention is paid towards point and mobile sources of PM (e.g., power plants, vehicles), episodic/periodic events such as dust storms, use of fireworks etc. can also increase ambient PM levels and lead to adverse effects on air quality, visibility, and human health, albeit in the short-term. Fireworks and bonfires are commonly used during religious and cultural festivals including Diwali (India), Lunar New Year (China), Bastille Day (France), Guy Fawkes Night (UK), Australia Day (Australia), Fourth of July/Independence Day (USA), New Year's Eve (worldwide) as well as large sporting and other events. During these events, use of fireworks results in smoke plumes which can raise the PM concentration levels for short periods of time. This review article summarizes the current body of literature on the role of fireworks use (and bonfires) on air quality, visibility, and human health. A summary of distinct type of fireworks and existing legislations/laws in different countries is also presented. Overall, there is clear evidence that such events produce exceptionally high level of pollutants, and as a result there can be intense exposures to a multipollutant mixture. In particular, the sharpest spikes are found in pollutant concentrations (such as PM2.5, PM10, and NOx) during and immediately after the firework event, followed by a decrease in the concentrations back to background levels, typically within 24 h. Peak concentrations of pollutants during firework events can exceed ambient levels by 2–8 times. As a result, overall visibility also decreases significantly, and in some cases, by as much as 92% during fireworks events. Moreover, significant health risks due to fireworks activities are also reported, although limited research has been conducted on this type of rapid air pollution exposure.

abstract={A method has been developed to authenticate aged high-quality wines and to quantify their potential adulterations through multivariate analysis and regression techniques applied to the obtained RGB digital images. Wines of pure Gran Reserva, Crianza, and Joven Rioja as well as synthetic adulterated Gran Reserva samples were studied. Digital images were obtained by a single and inexpensive lab-made device. Each sample was characterized by means of the 256 channels intensities from the RGB-colorgram. Multivariate image analysis revealed differences among the wine classes, and between genuine-aged and adulterated samples. Partial least squares regression was used to develop a model for estimating the adulteration degree of Gran Reserva wines. The model achieved good prediction (RMSEP = 1.6), appropriate precision (RSD = 2.5%) and suitable LOD (2.3%) to quantify cost-effective adulterations. The present method, due to simplicity and low cost, could provide an appropriate alternative to the traditional chemical authentication methods. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={In the present study, protein fingerprints from six novel Indian black gram varieties were obtained using 2D-GE. The results revealed the presence of thirteen well-resolved protein spots in all six varieties. Analysis of the fingerprints using PD Quest™ revealed differential protein expression. In addition, six proteins were found to be uniquely expressed in varieties PDKV Black Gold and TAU-1. Further, analysis of 2D patterns of black gram and potential adulterants such as refined wheat flour and white pea using PD Quest™ revealed the presence of proteins with MW 15.0 kDa, pI 4.89 (refined flour) and MW 21.5 kDa, pI 5.70 (white pea), which can be considered as biomarkers for their presence in black gram food products. The method was sensitive enough to detect adulteration at 5% level and could successfully detect the potential presence of refined flour in one of the black gram papad samples analysed during the study. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Solvent-assisted flavor evaporation (SAFE) is considered to be the best overall method to produce a “clean” aroma extract to avoid the loss of labile aroma compounds or the formation of thermally generated artifacts during gas chromatographic (GC) analysis. However, SAFE is both time consuming and labor intensive, especially when applied repeatedly for quantitation by stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA), which requires the addition of isotopes within specific mass ratio ranges relative to target analytes. The streamlined approach described herein allows for accurate quantitation of odor-active components in liquor products with a single SAFE operation. The quantitative results achieved by this method are nearly identical for most odor-active components, except for specific semi-volatile constituents not recovered well by SAFE (e.g., vanillin and syringaldehyde in oak-aged liquors). The streamlined approach provides a simple and convenient way to expedite the careful and exhaustive study of the flavor chemistry of aged liquors. © 2019},

abstract={The crystallization of amorphous sucrose can be problematic in food products. This study explored how emulsifiers (a range of sucrose esters, polysorbates, and soy lecithin) impact the moisture sorption and crystallization of amorphous sucrose lyophiles. Solutions containing sucrose with and without emulsifiers were lyophilized, stored in desiccators, and analyzed by X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and polarized light microscopy over time. Moisture sorption techniques, Karl Fischer titration, and differential scanning calorimetry were also used. Different emulsifiers had varying impacts on sucrose crystallization tendencies. Polysorbates enhanced sucrose crystallization, decreasing both the RH and time at which sucrose crystallized. These lyophiles did not collapse upon crystallization, unlike all other samples, indicating the likelihood of variations in nucleation sites and crystal growth. All other emulsifiers stabilized amorphous sucrose by up to a factor of 7x, even in the presence of increased water absorbed and independent of glass transition temperatures, indicating emulsifier structure governed sucrose crystallization tendencies. © 2019},

abstract={Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)-based lateral flow strip (LFS) enables a quick screening of foodborne bacteria in point-of-care (POC) diagnostics but suffers from the cumbersome labeling of antibodies and poor sensitive performance. Here, we innovated a label-free immunoassay to detect pathogenic bacteria by introducing diversely positive charges functionalized AuNPs ((+) AuNPs). The (+) AuNPs can be loaded on negatively charged bacteria via electrostatic interaction, leading to a color labeling to target bacteria. Afterward, the (+) AuNPs-bacteria complex can be specifically captured by monoclonal antibody (McAb) immobilized on test (T)-line. Under optimum conditions, the proposed LFS exhibited a lowest detectable concentration of 103 CFU/mL for Salmonella enteritidis (S. enteritidis) and could be well applied in drinking water, lettuce and pork samples. Moreover, this novel (+) AuNPs-LFS possessed a universal applicability, which could also be used for detecting Escherichia coli O157 (E. coli O157) with a superior sensitivity (104 CFU/mL) and specificity. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={To enhance the physicochemical and functional properties of insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) from buckwheat straw, we investigated the effects of alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP) treatment. Electron microscopy showed that the IDF had regular and compact tubes that turned into wrinkled lamellar products. After AHP treatment, X-ray diffraction indicated that the crystalline structure of the IDF was perturbed. And an undesirable decrease was observed in the content of hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives, hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, flavonoids and the antioxidant capacity of IDF modified by AHP; however, the hydration properties (such as water holding capacity), α-amylase inhibition activity and glucose adsorption capacity of IDF were significantly enhanced by AHP. Furthermore, AHP led to a redistribution of monosaccharides in soluble dietary fiber and IDF, an interesting finding hinting at the mechanism and potential applications of AHP modification of IDF. In this study, AHP enhanced the physiological and functional properties of buckwheat straw IDF. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Direct cold plasma treatment has been investigated as an alternative non-thermal technology as a means of maintaining and improving quality of fresh cloudy apple juice. Process variables studied included type of plasma discharge, input voltage and treatment time on polyphenol oxidase (PPO) inactivation. Spark discharge plasma at 10.5 kV for 5 min was the best treatment, with near total inactivation of PPO achieved, although good PPO inactivation was also recorded using shorter treatment times. Residual activity (RA) of PPO was 16 and 27.6% after 5 and 4 min of treatment respectively. This PPO inactivation was maintained throughout the storage trials, but decreased with samples treated for a shorter time. Plasma treatment improved key quality parameters of Golden delicious cloudy apple juice, with retention of critical quality parameters during extended storage trials. Color was the most noticeable change, which was enhanced with retention of a greener color. An increase of 69 and 64% was obtained in the total phenolic content after 4 and 5 min of treatment, respectively. Therefore, cold plasma was demonstrated to be a good alternative to traditional heat treatments for enhanced quality retention of fresh cloudy apple juice and over its storage. © 2019},

abstract={In a recent article I have concluded that phantom nuclei are irrelevant for an isothermal crystallization process that consists of nucleation and spherical growth, and for the type of growth rates considered in my study. I illustrated phantom irrelevance by comparing two solutions of the crystallization formulation I introduced: the first one is a constant nucleation rate model, which can be represented by the Avrami equation and does not excludes phantoms; the second is a solution with a varying nucleation rate that is proportional to the fraction of untransformed material. I maintain that this latter case excludes phantoms. In a Comment on my article by Tomellini and Fanfoni it is claimed that my comparison is invalid. Their main argument is that a varying nucleation rate solution does not exclude phantoms. To refute this claim, I present arguments supporting my assertion that a phantom-excluding model can be obtained by introducing a nucleation rate proportional to the fraction of untransformed phase. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={All known oxide glasses are inherently brittle, but their resistance to damage such as hardness and crack resistance varies strongly as a function of the chemical composition. The damage resistance is in turn related to the underlying deformation mechanism, which is at least partly related to the Poisson's ratio. That is, glasses with high Poisson's ratio tend to mostly deform through shear flow relative to densification, which leads to ductility in metallic glasses for Poisson's ratio above ~0.33. In this study, we investigate the structure and mechanical properties of a binary zinc borate glass with a relatively high Poisson's ratio (0.30), which we modify by partial substitution of ZnO with La2O3. Glass transition temperature, density, Vickers hardness and crack resistance, as well as elastic constants are studied, in addition to the short and intermediate range structure as probed by 11B solid-state NMR and Raman spectroscopy. We find that the substitution of La for Zn leads to a monotonic increase in Poisson's ratio and elastic moduli, while local maxima are recorded in the trends of glass transition temperature, hardness, and crack resistance. Correlations between the mechanical and structural properties are discussed to shed light onto the structural origin of damage resistance in oxide glasses with high Poisson's ratio. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

Analysis of selected polymorphisms in AhR pathway genes in 805 MS patients and 1023 controls revealed a modest association of a CYP1B1 polymorphism with secondary progressive MS that became more pronounced in combination with other SNPs in the pathway, suggesting interactive effects. Additionally, first evidence for an interaction with smoking was found, but due to small sample sizes statistical significance was only nominal. Confirmation of these results in independent cohorts is recommended, since targeting the AhR constitutes a therapeutic option for autoimmune diseases. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Hyporheic zones are increasingly thought of as natural bioreactors, capable of transforming and attenuating groundwater pollutants present in diffuse baseflow. An underappreciated scenario in the understanding of contaminant fate in hyporheic zones is the interaction between point-source trichloroethene (TCE) plumes and ubiquitous, non-point source pollutants such as nitrate. This study aims to conceptualise critical biogeochemical gradients in the hyporheic zone which govern the export potential of these redox-sensitive pollutants from carbon-poor, oxic aquifers. Within the TCE plume discharge zone, discrete vertical profiling of the upper 100 cm of sediment pore water chemistry revealed an 80% increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and 20–60 cm thick hypoxic zones (&lt;2 mg O2 L−1) within which most reactive transport was observed. A 33% reduction of nitrate concentrations coincided with elevated pore water nitrous oxide concentrations as well as the appearance of manganese and the TCE metabolite cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE). Elevated groundwater nitrate concentrations (&gt;50 mg L−1) create a large stoichiometric demand for bioavailable DOC in discharging groundwater. With the benefit of a high-resolution grid of pore water samplers investigating the shallowest 30 cm of hypoxic groundwater flow paths, we identified DOC-rich hotspots associated with submerged vegetation (Ranunculus spp.), where low-energy metabolic processes such as mineral dissolution/reduction, methanogenesis and ammonification dominate. Using a chlorine index metric, we show that enhanced TCE to cDCE transformation takes place within these biogeochemical hotspots, highlighting their relevance for natural plume attenuation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Particular attention has been given to coupling the humidification-dehumidification cycles with refrigeration, power and other desalination technologies with the aim of enhancing the performance of the combined cycle as well as increasing the amount of produced freshwater, cooling effect, power, etc. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art investigations in terms of humidification-dehumidification technologies and their integration with the aforementioned cycles. In other words, an attempt has been made to categorize and discuss the various combined cycles based on humidification-dehumidification technology. A detailed comparison has been drawn regarding the performance criteria of the coupled cycles in terms of freshwater production, gained output ratio, and cost per liter. This comprehensive review lays the groundwork for future research concentrating on humidification-dehumidification based energy cycles. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation acts as an elicitor to enhance the production of secondary metabolites in medicinal plants. To investigate the mechanisms, which lead to secondary metabolites in Catharanthus roseus under UVB radiation, a phosphoproteomic technique was used. ATP content increased in the leaves of C. roseus under UVB radiation. Phosphoproteins related to calcium such as calmodulin, calcium-dependent kinase, and heat shock proteins increased. Phosphoproteins related to protein synthesis/modification/degradation and signaling intensively changed. Metabolomic analysis indicated that the metabolites classified with pentoses, aromatic amino acids, and phenylpropanoids accumulated under UVB radiation. Phosphoproteomic and immunoblot analyses indicated that proteins related to glycolysis and the reactive-oxygen species scavenging system were changed under UVB radiation. These results suggest that UVB radiation activates the calcium-related pathway and reactive-oxygen species scavenging system in C. roseus. These changes lead to the upregulation of proteins, which are responsible for the redox reactions in secondary metabolism and are important for the accumulation of secondary metabolites in C. roseus under UVB radiation. © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Photonic crystal-based biosensors hold great promise as low-cost devices for real-time monitoring of a variety of biotargets, for example, bacterial contaminants in food. Here, we report the proof-of-concept for a new colorimetric sensor of bacterial contamination, which is based on a novel hybrid plasmonic-photonic device. Our system consists of a layer of silver, a plasmonic metal exhibiting a well-known bioactivity, on top of a one-dimensional photonic crystal. We attribute the bioresponsivity to the formation of polarization charges at the Ag/bacterium interface within a sort of "bio-doping" mechanism. Interestingly, this triggers a blue shift in the photonic response. As an example, we assessed the validity of our approach by detecting one of the most hazardous contaminants, Escherichia coli. This work demonstrates that our device can be a low-cost and portable platform for the detection of common bacterial contaminants. © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Introduction: To achieve the global goal of canine-mediated human rabies elimination by 2030 there is an urgent need to scale-up mass dog vaccination activities in regions with large dog populations that are difficult to access; a common situation in much of India. Oral rabies vaccination may enable the vaccination of free-roaming dogs that are inaccessible to parenteral vaccination, and is considered a promising complementary measure to parenteral mass dog vaccination campaigns. WHO and OIE have published detailed minimum requirements for rabies vaccines and baits to be used for this purpose, requiring that baits must not only be well-accepted by the target population but must also efficiently release the vaccine in the oral cavity. For oral rabies vaccination approaches to be successful, it is necessary to develop baits which have a high uptake by the target population, are culturally accepted and amenable to mass production. The aim of this study was to compare the interest and uptake rates of meat-based and an egg-based prototype bait constructs by free roaming dogs in Goa, India. Methods: Three teams randomly distributed two prototype baits; an egg-flavoured bait and a commercial meat dog food (gravy) flavoured bait. The outcomes of consumption were recorded and compared between baits and dog variables. Results: A total of 209 egg-bait and 195 gravy-bait distributions were recorded and analysed. No difference (p = 0.99) was found in the percentage of dogs interested in the baits when offered. However, significantly more dogs consumed the egg-bait than the gravy-bait; 77.5% versus 68.7% (p = 0.04). The release of the blue-dyed water inside the sachet in the oral cavity of the animals was significant higher in the dogs consuming an egg-bait compared to the gravy-bait (73.4% versus 56.7%, p = 0.001). Conclusions: The egg-based bait had a high uptake amongst free roaming dogs and also enabled efficient release of the vaccine in the oral cavity, whilst also avoiding culturally relevant materials of bovine or porcine meat products. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Crystallization by particle attachment (CPA) of amorphous precursors has been demonstrated in modern biomineralized skeletons across a broad phylogenetic range of animals. Precisely the same precursors, hydrated (ACC-H2O) and anhydrous calcium carbonate (ACC), have been observed spectromicroscopically in echinoderms, mollusks, and cnidarians, phyla drawn from the 3 major clades of eumetazoans. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) here also shows evidence of CPA in tunicate chordates. This is surprising, as species in these clades have no common ancestor that formed a mineralized skeleton and appear to have evolved carbonate biomineralization independently millions of years after their late Neoproterozoic divergence. Here we correlate the occurrence of CPA from ACC precursor particles with nanoparticulate fabric and then use the latter to investigate the antiquity of the former. SEM images of early biominerals from Ediacaran and Cambrian shelly fossils show that these early calcifiers used attachment of ACC particles to form their biominerals. The convergent evolution of biomineral CPA may have been dictated by the same thermodynamics and kinetics as we observe today. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Due to the power and impact of social media, unsolved practical issues such as human trafficking, kinship recognition, and clustering family photos from large collections have recently received special attention from researchers. In this paper, we present a new idea for family and non-family photo classification. Unlike existing methods that explore face recognition and biometric features, the proposed method explores the strengths of facial geometric features and texture given by a new fractional-entropy approach for classification. The geometric features include spatial and angle information of facial key points, which give spatial and directional coherence. The texture features extract regular patterns in images. The proposed method then combines the above properties in a new way for classifying family and non-family photos with the help of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Experimental results on our own as well as benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification rate. © 2019},

Bødker et.al (Bødker, Mauro, Youngman, &amp; Smedskjaer, 2019) predicted the Tg using statistical mechanics and topological constraint theory (TCT) over a wide range of contents (to 65 mol% Li2O). Although Bødker's model predicted the fraction of the structures present, this paper examines the linkage between intermediate-range structures and properties of the glasses. Tg was found using TCT with the structural model of Feller, Dell, and Bray (Feller, Dell, Bray, 1982). The topology of the intermediate-range structure was related to rigidity, and to lithium clustering. © 2019},

abstract={Actionable Knowledge Discovery has attracted much interest lately. It is almost a new paradigm shift toward mining more usable and more applicable knowledge in each specific domain. An action is a new tool in this research area that suggests some changes to the user to gain a profit in his/her domain. Currently, most of action mining methods rely on simple data which describes each object independently. Since social data has more complex structure due to the relationships between individuals, a major problem is that such structural information is not taken into account in the action mining process. This leads to miss some useful knowledge and profitable actions. Consequently, more effective methods are needed for mining actions. The main focus of this work is to extract cost-effective actions from social networks in which nodes have attributes. The actions suggest optimal changes in nodes’ attributes that are likely to result in changing labels of users to more desired one when they are applied. We develop an action mining method based on Random Walks that naturally combines the information from the network structure with nodes attributes. We formulate action mining as an optimization problem where the goal is to learn a function that varies the values of nodes’ attributes which in turn affect edges’ weights in the network so that the labels of intended individuals are likely to take the desired label while minimizing the cost of incurring the changes. Experiments confirm that the proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art in action mining. © 2019},

abstract={A previous report (Möncke et al., PCG 2013) discussed the possible formation of a borosilicate layer on the surface of Late Bronze Age glass samples (Mycenaean period, excavated in Palaia Epidavros, Greece). Now, we investigate potential mechanisms for such suggested borate incorporation into the surface of alkali-lime silicate glasses. Since former studies reported that glass relief fragments have been found alongside gold foils featuring identical reliefs, we tested the hypothesis that borates could have been introduced through gold working via the reaction of a borax-treated gold foil with the silicate glass surface at elevated temperature. A borosilicate layer was successfully generated on replica soda lime silicate glass samples and identified by vibrational spectroscopy. Different approaches were used in order to merge gold sheets to the glass samples. At temperatures above 800 °C, borax could have been used either as a solder in the fusion process between a gold sheet and the glass surface, or borate was transferred from the gold sheet previously in contact with a borax melt, presumably for cleaning gold or during ore extraction. The depth of the borosilicate layer on the thus treated glasses extents from the surface several μm into the bulk glass as probed by micro-Raman and IR spectroscopy, while the dimensions of the spread across the glass surface can be visualized by neutron radiography. © 2019},

abstract={Distributed semantic representation of biomedical text can be beneficial for text classification, named entity recognition, query expansion, human comprehension, and information retrieval. Despite the success of high-quality vector space models such as Word2Vec and GloVe, they only provide unigram word representations and the semantics for multi-word phrases can only be approximated by composition. This is problematic in biomedical text processing where technical phrases for diseases, symptoms, and drugs should be represented as single entities to capture the correct meaning. In this paper, we introduce PMCVec, an unsupervised technique that generates important phrases from PubMed abstracts and learns embeddings for single words and multi-word phrases simultaneously. Evaluations performed on benchmark datasets produce significant performance gains both qualitatively and quantitatively. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Using the potential energy landscape formalism we show that, in the temperature range in which the dynamics of a glass forming system is thermally activated, there exists a unique set of ‘basis glass states’ each of which is confined to a single metabasin of the energy landscape of a glass forming system. These basis glass states tile the entire configuration space of the system, exhibit only secondary relaxation and are solid-like. Any macroscopic state of the system (whether liquid or glass) can be represented as a superposition of basis glass states and can be described by a probability distribution over these states. During cooling of a liquid from a high temperature, the probability distribution freezes at sufficiently low temperatures describing the process of liquid to glass transition. The time evolution of the probability distribution towards the equilibrium distribution during subsequent aging describes the primary relaxation of a glass. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The local structures of Cu(I) and Cu(II) in (20-x)Na2O-xK2O-10CaO-70SiO2 glasses with a copper content of 0.4 mol% have been investigated by Cu K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). Complementary data for Cu(II) was derived using UV–Vis-NIR spectroscopy. Indication for mainly linear two-fold coordination of the Cu+ ion was found by both EXAFS and XANES, but other coordination between Cu+ and O2– cannot be excluded. The Cu(I)&amp;O bond lengths were found to be 1.79–1.83 ± 0.02 Å. EXAFS results showed that Cu(II) was mostly present in a Jahn-Teller distorted environment with oxygen, an octahedron with four shorter Cu(II)&amp;O bonds and two longer in axial position. The equatorial bond lengths were found to be 1.89–1.91 ± 0.02 Å and the axial 2.20–2.24 ± 0.02 Å with no effect of the Jahn-Teller distortion of the octahedron when the glass composition was altered. © 2019},

abstract={High energy X-ray diffraction can be combined with containerless techniques to provide information on the atomic arrangements in glass-forming liquids in stable and metastable regimes. The high incident energies provide bulk diffraction data to high values of scattering vector which enables significantly more robust analysis of the local and medium-range order that influences important physical properties such as viscosity and crystal nucleation. These combined techniques have been applied to a range of oxide liquids. In this contribution we illustrate addition of further dimensions to phase space by controlling the partial pressure of oxygen that permits the study liquids containing iron. The advantages of rapid data acquisition are also demonstrated in a study of tellurite glass-forming systems where a transition from ergodic to non-ergodic regimes in the deeply supercooled liquid is shown. Finally we demonstrate how descriptions of the liquid structure can be developed by combining HEXRD with molecular dynamics simulations. © 2019},

abstract={The authors present an expert and intelligent system that (1) identifies influential term groups having causal relationships with real-world enterprise outcomes from Twitter data and (2) quantifies the appropriate time lags between identified influential term groups and enterprise outcomes. Existing expert and intelligent systems, which are defined as computer systems that imitate the ability of human decision making, could enable computers to identify the spread of Twitter users’ enterprise-related feedback automatically. However, existing expert and intelligent systems have limitations on automatically identifying the causal effects on enterprise outcomes. Identifying the causal effects on enterprise outcomes is important, because Twitter users’ feedback toward enterprise decisions may have real-world implications. The proposed expert and intelligent system can support decision makers’ decisions considering the real-world effects of identified Twitter users’ feedback on enterprise outcomes. In particular, (1) a co-occurrence network analysis model is exploited to discover term candidates for generating influential term groups that are combinations of enterprise-related terms, which potentially influence enterprise outcomes. (2) Time series models and (3) a Granger causality analysis model are then employed to identify influential term groups having causal relationships with enterprise outcomes with the appropriate time lags. Case studies involving a real-world internet video streaming and disc rental provider as well as an airline company are used to test the validity of the proposed expert and intelligent system for both predicting enterprise outcomes in a long period and predicting the effects of specific events on enterprise outcomes in a short period. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={The purpose of this research is to study the characteristics of the change in the circadian rhythm of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) content in the peripheral blood serum of patients with stage II essential hypertension (EH) based on 5 time points (8:00, 14:00, 20:00, 2:00, and 8:00) and analyze its connection with the frequency of cardiovascular events. Materials and methods: Identified levels of M-CSF in the peripheral blood serum of 60 patients with stage II EH, before and after 1 year of antihypertensive therapy using enzyme-linked immunoassays (at 8:00, 14:00, 20:00, 2:00, and 8:00). Results: The research demonstrated that stage II EH patients with a medical case history lasting 10–14 years have a greater content of M-CSF in their peripheral blood serum (p > 0.001). Before the start of antihypertensive therapy, they also have an increased variability in the circadian rhythm of M-CSF content in the bloodstream (when compared with healthy individuals) due to an increase at 20:00, decrease at 2:00 and recovery at 8:00. In 70% of those patients taking antihypertensive medication and have reached their target arterial blood pressure, the cytokine decrease stabilizes at 2:00 but the increase at 20:00 remains unchanged. Thirty percent of patients retained the rhythm characteristics of M-CSF content in the blood serum typical of patients before the start of therapy. This is a predictor of an increase in the five-year risk of developing cardiovascular complications, particularly myocardial infarction and acute cerebrovascular accident, in individuals with a comparable risk of cardiovascular complications or death on the Framingham risk score. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Background and aims: Sitosterolaemia (STSL; OMIN #210250) is a disorder of lipid metabolism and a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by loss-of-function biallelic mutations in the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette, subfamily G member 5 (ABCG5) gene (NM_022,436.2) or in the adjacent ABCG8 gene (NM_022,437.2). STSL patients often have high plasma total sterols and present a heterogeneous phenotype. Here, we describe a male patient with a post-mortem diagnosis of STSL who was admitted to the emergency department with advanced heart failure, tendon xanthomas and findings from the follow up with his living family members. Methods: We established a family pedigree and performed whole-exome next-generation sequencing for the patient and Sanger sequencing of DNA samples obtained from his living family members. Plasma sterol (β-sitosterol) level was measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Results: Both the patient and his younger brother carried a homozygous mutation of p. R263Q (c.788G > A) in the ABCG8 gene. The patient's plasma plant sterol level was extremely high (β-sitosterol: 107.5 μg/ml), and the plasma β-sitosterol level of his younger brother without tendon xanthomas was also abnormally high (51.5 μg/ml). The β-sitoserol levels of other living family members including ones with a heterozygous mutation of p. R263Q (c.788G > A) were normal (i.e. undetectable). Based on the results of genetic detection and very high plasma level of β-sitosterol, we made a definitive diagnosis of STSL. Conclusions: Emergency physicians should be aware of the need to further investigate individuals with xanthomas and cardiovascular disease using biochemical and genetic analyses to aid in diagnosis and intervention. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={The Lorentz equations describe the motion of electrically charged particles in electric and magnetic fields and are used widely in plasma physics. The most popular numerical algorithm for solving them is the Boris method, a variant of the Störmer-Verlet algorithm. Boris method is phase space volume conserving and simulated particles typically remain near the correct trajectory. However, it is only second order accurate. Therefore, in scenarios where it is not enough to know that a particle stays on the right trajectory but one needs to know where on the trajectory the particle is at a given time, Boris method requires very small time steps to deliver accurate phase information, making it computationally expensive. We derive an improved version of the high-order Boris spectral deferred correction algorithm (Boris-SDC) by adopting a convergence acceleration strategy for second order problems based on the Generalised Minimum Residual (GMRES) method. Our new algorithm is easy to implement as it still relies on the standard Boris method. Like Boris-SDC it can deliver arbitrary order of accuracy through simple changes of runtime parameter but possesses better long-term energy stability. We demonstrate for two examples, a magnetic mirror trap and the Solev'ev equilibrium, that the new method can deliver better accuracy at lower computational cost compared to the standard Boris method. While our examples are motivated by tracking ions in the magnetic field of a nuclear fusion reactor, the introduced algorithm can potentially deliver similar improvements in efficiency for other applications. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={The layout of manufacturing facilities has a large impact on manufacturing performance. The layout design process produces a block plan that shows the relative positioning of resources that can be developed into a detailed layout drawing. The total material handling distance is commonly used for measuring material flow. Manufacturing systems are subject to external and internal uncertainties including demand and machine breakdowns. Uncertainty and the rerouting of material flows have an impact on the material handling distance. No previous research has integrated robust machine layout design through multiple periods of dynamic demand with machine maintenance planning. This paper presents a robust machine layout design tool that minimises the material flow distance using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), taking into account demand uncertainty and machine maintenance. Experiments were conducted using eleven benchmark datasets that considered three scenarios: preventive maintenance (PM), corrective maintenance (CM) and both PM and CM. The results were analysed statistically. The effect of several maintenance scenarios including the ratio of the number of machines with period-based PM (PPM) to the number with production quantity-based PM (QPM), the percentage of machines with CM (%CM), and a combination of PMM/QPM ratios and %CM on material flow distance were examined. The results show that designing robust layouts considering maintenance resulted in shorter material flow distances. The distance was decreased by 30.91%, 9.8%, and 20.7% for the PM, CM, and both PM/CM scenarios, respectively. The PPM/QPM ratios, %CM, and a combination of PPM/QPM and %CM had significantly resulted in the material flow distance on almost all datasets. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Ice accretion on external surfaces of aircraft due to the impingement of supercooled liquid water droplets can be tackled by the implementation of icephobic surfaces. Among these, superhydrophobic surfaces represent a promising solution, due to their water repellent nature. In the last decade, short/ultra-short pulsed laser technologies have been proposed as a one-step process to manufacture superhydrophobic surfaces. However, the effectiveness and durability of such surfaces in operational icing conditions has not yet been validated.

abstract={We construct high-order derivative operators for smooth functions represented via discontinuous multiwavelet bases. The need for such operators arises in order to avoid artifacts when computing functionals involving high-order derivatives of solutions of integral equations. Previously high-order derivatives had to be formed by repeated application of a first-derivative operator that, while uniquely defined, has a spectral norm that grows quadratically with polynomial order and, hence, greatly amplifies numerical noise (truncation error) in the multiwavelet computation. The new constructions proceed via least-squares projection onto smooth bases and provide substantially improved numerical properties as well as permitting direct construction of high-order derivatives. We employ either b-splines or bandlimited exponentials as the intermediate smooth basis, with the former maintaining the concept of approximation order while the latter preserves the pure imaginary spectrum of the first-derivative operator and provides more direct control over the bandlimit and accuracy of computation. We demonstrate the properties of these new operators via several numerical tests as well as application to a problem in nuclear physics. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Rigidity plays an important role on the relaxation properties of glass forming melts, yet it is usually determined from the average coordination number through the chemical composition. A discussion is presented on how viscoelasticity can be used as an alternative way to determine glass rigidity and to give clues about the relaxation processes. It is shown that the transverse current dynamical structure factor of dense glass and crystal forming fluids contain rich information about rigidity that can be related with the presence of a dynamical-gap for transversal vibrational-modes. Then, the number of floppy modes can be related with the dynamical gap size and with the liquid relaxation time. Furthermore, a dynamical average effective coordination number can be defined. Numerical simulations for hard-disks in a dense fluid phase are provided. A discussion is presented on the need to improve glass viscoelasticity models to describe consistently non-exponential stress and strain relaxation. © 2019},

abstract={Constant-rate pumping tests (CRPT) performed in aquifers having an inclined substratum (IS) cannot be interpreted using Theis-like models, due to an increasing thickness that is beyond conventional hydraulic assumptions. Using an empirical process based on numerical modelling, this study submits original tools for the detection of IS aquifers and the interpretation of their hydrodynamic responses to CRPT, using derivative [ds/dlog(t)] and flow dimension (n) analyses. It is shown that IS aquifers produce a drawdown log-derivative signal composed of two radial regimes and one spherical flow regime (n-sequence = 2–2–3). Comprehensive sensitivity analyses make it possible to constrain relationships between, on one hand, characteristic derivative responses, and on the other hand, hydraulic conditions such as pumping rate, distance from the well to the corner, substratum inclination, and aquifer properties, including anisotropic hydraulic conductivity. This study contributes to widening the array of tools available for the interpretation of pumping tests, by implementing a novel conceptual model for a specific type of nonuniform aquifer that has remained unaddressed; further, it provides another interpretation of the spherical flow regime, which has been interpreted in the petroleum literature to reflect partially penetrating/completing wells. Finally, a field application of the submitted interpretative tools to a CRPT into an IS aquifer is presented. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Magnetic nanocomposites have attracted increasing attention due to its widely applications in different areas in recent years. The conventional synthesis of magnetic nanocomposites is usually based on high temperature annealing technique from biomass. In this paper, a microwave method has been developed to prepare iron oxide based magnetic nanocomposites using ferric acetylacetonate ((Fe(acac)3), oleylamine (OAm), oleic acid (OA), and commercial biochar. The reaction is completed in several minutes. Composite structure composed of γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles with the size of 6–17 nm and biochar is confirmed by TEM, SEM EDX element mapping images. The iron oxide size can be controlled by the microwave time and the ligand ratio. Magnetic properties of the magnetic nanocomposites are studied. The application of the prepared magnetic nanocomposites in magnetic concentration cells are tested with different magnetic fields and different biochar to iron oxide ratios. The method developed in this work on magnetic nanocomposite synthesis will not only facilitate the research progress of magnetic nanocomposite synthesis but also provide an alternative technique to be used in magnetic concentration cells. © 2019},

abstract={The pressure-induced structural transformations in metasilicate MSiO3 glass (M = Mg or Ca) on cold-compression from ambient pressure to 17.5 GPa were investigated by neutron diffraction. The structure of the glass recovered to ambient conditions from a pressure of 8.2 or 17.5 GPa was also investigated by neutron or X-ray diffraction. The experimental work was complemented by molecular dynamics simulations using a newly-developed aspherical ion model. The results show network structures based predominantly on corner-sharing tetrahedral SiO4 units. At pressures up to ~8 GPa, there is little change to the network connectivity as described by the Qn speciation, where n denotes the number of bridging oxygen (BO) atoms per SiO4 tetrahedron. On compression of the glass to 17.5 GPa, the Mg–O coordination number increases from 4.5(1) to 6.2(1), and the Ca–O coordination number increases from 6.15(17) to 7.41(7). In both cases, the increased M-O coordination numbers are accompanied by an increased fraction of M-BO versus M-NBO connections, where NBO denotes a non-bridging oxygen atom. The results give the fraction of triple-bridging oxygen atoms as ~0.5% at 17.5 GPa, which does not support the formation of a substantial fraction of oxygen triclusters in either glass. The M-O coordination number of the recovered glass is larger than for the uncompressed material, which originates from an increased fraction of M-BO connections, and increases with the pressure from which the glass is recovered. The results suggest that the measured decrease in viscosity of molten MSiO3 on pressure increasing from ambient to ~8 GPa is not related to a large change in network polymerization, but to the appearance of higher-coordinated M-centred polyhedra that contain a larger fraction of weaker M-BO bonds. © 2019},

abstract={Recent developments have resulted in electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) becoming a useful tool for the structure determination of biological macromolecules. For samples containing inherent flexibility, heterogeneity or preferred orientation, the collection of extensive cryo-EM data using several conditions and microscopes is often required. In such a scenario, merging cryo-EM data sets is advantageous because it allows improved three-dimensional reconstructions to be obtained. Since data sets are not always collected with the same pixel size, merging data can be challenging. Here, two methods to combine cryo-EM data are described. Both involve the calculation of a rescaling factor from independent data sets. The effects of errors in the scaling factor on the results of data merging are also estimated. The methods described here provide a guideline for cryo-EM users who wish to combine data sets from the same type of microscope and detector. © 2019 Wiley-Blackwell. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Evolution of submicron particles in terms of particle number concentration and mobility-equivalent diameter was measured during Diwali festival–specific intensive pyrotechnic displays in Varanasi over central Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). A scanning mobility particle sizer coupled with an optical particle sizer was used to fit in an overlapping size range, and particle number concentration was analyzed to have an insight into the new particle formation and subsequent evolution of particles from nucleation to accumulation mode. Further, variation in black carbon (BC) concentration and aerosol ionic composition was measured simultaneously. Frequent fluctuation in particle number concentration in and around Diwali festival was evidenced, primarily influenced by local emission sources and meteorology, with three distinct peaks in number concentrations (dN/dlogDp, 3.1–4.5 × 104 cm3) coinciding well with peak firework emission period (18:00–23:00 h). Submicron particle size distribution revealed a single peak covering a size range of 80–130 nm, and for all instances, number concentration maximum coincided with geometric mean minimum, indicating the emission primarily in the ultrafine range (&lt; 0.1 μm). Interestingly, during peak firework emissions, besides rise in accumulation mode, an event of new particle formation was identified with increase in nucleation and small Aitken mode, before being dispersed to background aerosols. On an integral scale, a clear distinction was noted between a normal and an episodic event, with a definite shift in the formation of ultrafine particles compared with the accumulation mode. The BC diurnal profile was typical, with a prominent nocturnal peak (12.0 ± 3.9 μg m-3) corresponding to a decrease in the boundary layer height. A slight variation in maximum BC concentration (16.8 μg m-3) was noted in the night of the event coinciding well with firework emissions. An increase in some specific ionic species was also noted in combination with an increase in the overall cation to anion ratio, which was explained in terms of heterogeneous transformation of NOx and catalytic conversion of SO2.

abstract={5-Alpha-reductase 2 is an interesting pharmaceutical target for the treatment of several diseases, including prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, male pattern baldness, acne, and hirsutism. One of the main approaches in computer aided drug design is structure-based drug discovery. However, the experimental 3D structure of 5-alpha-reductase 2 is not available at present. Therefore, a homology modeling method and molecular dynamics simulation were used to develop a reliable model of 5-alpha-reductase 2 for inhibitor pose prediction and virtual screening. Despite the low sequence identity between the target and template sequences, a useful 3D model of 5-alpha-reductase 2 was generated by the inclusion of experimental data. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Animal venoms are promising sources of novel drug leads, but their translational potential is hampered by the low success rate of earlier biodiscovery programs, in part reflecting the narrow selection of targets for investigation. To increase the number of lead candidates, here we discuss a phylogeny-guided approach for the rational selection of venomous taxa, using tarantulas (family Theraphosidae) as a case study. We found that previous biodiscovery programs have prioritized the three subfamilies Ornithoctoninae, Selenocosmiinae, and Theraphosinae, which provide almost all of the toxin sequences currently available in public databases. The remaining subfamilies are poorly represented, if at all. These overlooked subfamilies include several that form entire clades of the theraphosid life tree, such as the subfamilies Eumenophorinae, Harpactirinae, and Stromatopelminae, indicating that biodiversity space has not been covered effiectively for venom biodiscovery in Theraphosidae. Focusing on these underrepresented taxa will increase the likelihood that promising candidates with novel structures and mechanisms of action can be identified in future bioprospecting programs. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Anthropogenic mineral residues are characterized by their material complexity and heterogeneity, which pose challenges to the chemical analysis of multiple elements. However, creating an urban mine knowledge database requires data using affordable and simple chemical analysis methods, providing accurate and valid results. In this study, we assess the applicability of simplified multi-element chemical analysis methods for two anthropogenic mineral waste matrices: (1) lithium-ion battery ash that was obtained from thermal pre-treatment and (2) rare earth elements (REE)-bearing iron-apatite ore from a Swedish tailing dam. For both samples, simplified methods comprising 'in-house' wet-chemical analysis and energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) spectrometry were compared to the results of the developed matrix-specific validated methods. Simplified wet-chemical analyses showed significant differences when compared to the validated method, despite proven internal quality assurance, such as verification of sample homogeneity, precision, and accuracy. Matrix-specific problems, such as incomplete digestion and overlapping spectra due to similar spectral lines (ICP-OES) or element masses (ICP-MS), can result in quadruple overestimations or underestimation by half when compared to the reference value. ED-XRF analysis proved to be applicable as semi-quantitative analysis for elements with mass fractions higher than 1000 ppm and an atomic number between Z 12 and Z 50. For elements with low mass fractions, ED-XRF analysis performed poorly and showed deviations of up to 90 times the validated value. Concerning all the results, we conclude that the characterization of anthropogenic mineral residues is prone to matrix-specific interferences, which have to be addressed with additional quality assurance measures. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Aims: (5R)-5-hydroxytriptolide (LLDT-8) is a triptolide analog with excellent capability against cancers, cerebral ischemic injury and rheumatoid arthritis. Here, we discovered its hepatoprotective effects in a mouse model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by ameliorating liver lipid accumulation. Main methods: Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with a high-fat/high-fructose (HFHFr) diet for 29 weeks to induce the pathological phenomena of NAFLD. Then the mice were treated with LLDT-8 (0.5mg/kg and 1mg/kg) or Vehicle for 8 weeks. Finally, the serum biochemical indexes, liver histological features, fatty acids (FAs) profile and related gene expression in liver were detected to investigate the effect of LLDT-8 on lipid accumulation and its possible mechanism. Key findings: LLDT-8 treatment significantly inhibited hepatic injury featured by the decrease of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), the lessening of hepatic ballooning and macrovesicular steatosis. Moreover, LLDT-8 could downregulate the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), which further led to the lower ratios of C16:1/C16:0 and C18:1/C18:0 and thus inhibited lipid synthesis. LLDT-8 treatment also could upregulate liver peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a), peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (Acox1), long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acadl) and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Acadm) expression levels involved in fatty acids oxidation (FAO) and markedly promoted lipolysis. Significance: Our results provide a novel application of LLDT-8 in improving NAFLD. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={In this paper, a family of stencil selection algorithms is presented for WENO schemes on unstructured meshes. The associated freedom of stencil selection for unstructured meshes, in the context of WENO schemes present a plethora of various stencil selection algorithms. The particular focus of this paper is to assess the performance of various stencil selection algorithm, investigate the parameters that dictate their robustness, accuracy and computational efficiency. Ultimately, efficient and robust stencils are pursued that can provide significant savings in computational performance, while retaining the non-oscillatory character of WENO schemes. This is achieved when making the stencil selection algorithms adaptive, based on the quality of the cells for unstructured meshes, that can in turn reduce the computational cost of WENO schemes. For assessing the performance of the developed algorithms well established test problems are employed. These include the least square approximation of polynomial functions, linear advection equation of smooth functions and solid body rotation test problem. Euler and Navier-Stokes equations test problems are also pursued such as the Shu-Osher test problem, the Double Mach Reflection, the supersonic Forward Facing step, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, the Taylor-Green Vortex, and the flow past a transonic circular cylinder. © 2019},

abstract={Fluoride phosphate/fluorophosphate (FP) glasses form an intriguing material's basis for diverse applications in optics, photonics and energy storage. The optimization of the materials' properties with regard to the application envisioned demands an understanding of the key concepts describing their local structures on different distance regimes. Because of the inevitable losses of fluoride during melting or annealing, the synthesis and elemental analytical characterization present important and critical challenges. In this contribution we summarize the current state of the literature regarding the structural characterization of these glasses. Foci are the detailed analysis of vibrational spectra with special emphasis on Raman scattering results and multinuclear solid-state NMR spectroscopy. While vibrational spectra give important information about the local environments (short range order) advanced multi-dimensional and multi-resonance methodology can extend the informational content of solid-state NMR into the sub-nanometer distance range, including second and third coordination spheres. Exemplary results will be presented for (a) aluminum fluoride based simple model systems, (b) fluoride phosphate glasses containing heavy transition metals or post-transition metal elements, and (c) rare-earth doped fluoride phosphate glasses for laser applications. The latter application field documents the utility of correlated spectroscopic studies using both methods in understanding the structural foundations of photophysical properties. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Emissions from fuel combustion and agricultural activities contribute significantly to the continuous atmospheric entrainment of pollutants into protected and vulnerable ecosystems where long-term monitoring is often a challenge. Here, results are presented from a 26-year study (1989–2015) of wet precipitation collected at Paradise Station (1654 m above sea level), Mount Rainier National Park, Washington, USA. Weekly samples were analyzed for pH, conductivity and major anions and cations. While precipitation concentrations for sulfate, nitrate, protons and conductivity peaked in the early 2000s, overall trends decreased by 54%, 46%, 41%, and 37%, respectively. Associated pH values increased from 5.2 to 5.6, and were largely controlled by non-sea-salt contributions of sulfate and neutralizing calcium, potassium and magnesium. Between 1999 and 2015, nitrogen (N) deposition rates from ammonium increased by a factor of 3.6, from 0.27 to 0.96 kg N ha−1 yr−1 (p = 0.02), while nitrate deposition did not change statistically (0.91–0.74 kg N ha−1 yr−1, p = 0.30). Combined, these N sources are reaching reported critical loads of 2.0 kg N ha−1 yr−1. Results indicate that emission regulations focused on stationary sources have effectively decreased apparent acid precipitation, however, increased nitrogen deposition from ammonium may lead to further fertilization and acidification of delicate soils and waters. Continued long-term monitoring is thus imperative to track continued anthropogenic inputs to vulnerable ecosystems. © 2019},

abstract={The fructose added to soft drinks and processed food, as well as frequent detection of vitamin D deficiency in the body, are two insults increasingly considered to cause lesions in target organs. We studied the liver after a chronic high-fructose diet deficient and supplemented with vitamin D. Sixty C57BL/6 mature male mice were allocated into six groups (n = 10) for ten weeks: control (C), control deficient in vitamin D (CDD), control supplemented with vitamin D (CDS), fructose (F), fructose deficient in vitamin D (FDD), and fructose supplemented with vitamin D (FDS). The gene expressions of vitamin D receptor and CYP27B1 and 25 hydroxyvitamin D plasma level ensured that the diets caused vitamin D deficiency or supplementation. Body mass did not change, but blood pressure (BP) increased in CDD, F, and FDD, whereas BP was controlled in FDS. Insulinemia, insulin tolerance and resistance were seen in both vitamin D deficiency and fructose groups but improved with vitamin D supplementation. The steatosis and fibrosis were observed in the CDD, F and FDD groups. Also, F and FDD showed activation of stellate cells (HSC). Lipogenesis and inflammation gene expressions were enhanced in the CDD, F and FDD groups, but diminished with vitamin D supplementation. In conclusion, we demonstrated the adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency on metabolism, liver steatosis and, combined with fructose intake, liver interstitial fibrosis with hepatic stellate cell activation, and alteration of the lipogenesis, beta-oxidation, and liver inflammation. All these data improved when vitamin D was supplemented in the animals. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={C-type lectin is a type of carbohydrate-binding protein and plays significant roles in innate immune response against pathogen infection. To date, thousands of C-type lectin had been identified in teleost. In the present study, we isolated a novel isoform of C-type lectin (OppCTL)from spotted knifejaw (Oplegnathus punctatus). The OppCTL encoded a typical Ca2+-dependent carbohydrate-binding protein, and was mainly expressed in liver in a tissue specific fashion. The expression of OppCTL was significantly up-regulated following Vibrio anguillarum infection in vivo, suggesting involvement in immune response. Hemagglutination analysis showed that the recombinant OppCTL (rOppCTL)could agglutinate erythrocyte from Mus musculus, Oplegnathus punctatus, Sebastes schlegelii and Paralichthys olivaceus. The rOppCTL could bind and agglutinate all tested bacteria. The rOppCTL possessed capacities of calcium-dependent agglutination to all tested bacteria. Sugar binding assay revealed that rOppCTL could also bind to the glycoconjugates of the bacterial surface, including lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan. Interestingly, Dual-luciferase analysis revealed that OppCTL could inhibit the activity of NF-κB in HEK-293T cells after OppCTL overexpression. Taken together, these results indicate that OppCTL has immune activity capable of defending invading pathogens and possesses potential immunoregulatory activity, enriching our understanding of the function of C-type lectin. © 2019},

abstract={Introduction Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous inflammatory disorder. Sarcoidosis is associated with significant morbidity and rising healthcare utilisation. Patients with sarcoidosis report higher psychological symptoms than the general population. We evaluated the association between depressive and anxiety symptoms and clinical outcomes in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis requiring treatment. Methods Adult patients in the Johns Hopkins Sarcoidosis Clinic diagnosed with pulmonary sarcoidosis on treatment were eligible for enrollment. Questionnaires were administered to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms, healthcare utilisation and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). results 112 participants were enrolled (57% women, 53% African American, median age: 57 years). 34% of participants screened positive for mild and 20% for moderate–severe depressive symptoms. 25% of participants screened positive for mild and 12% for moderate–severe anxiety symptoms. Participants with moderate–severe psychological symptoms had a higher odds of an emergency department visit in the previous 6 months (8.87 for depressive symptoms and 13.05 for anxiety symptoms) and worse HRQoL compared with participants without psychological symptoms. Participants with moderate–severe depressive symptoms had lower diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide % predicted compared with those without depressive symptoms. There was no association between elevated psychological symptoms and the odds of hospitalisation, forced vital capacity % predicted and forced expiratory volume in 1 second % predicted. conclusion Psychological symptoms may be associated with worse clinical outcomes in sarcoidosis. Improving the recognition through clinic screening and referral for treatment of depression and anxiety in sarcoidosis may reduce acute healthcare utilisation and improve HRQoL. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.},

abstract={Objective: To systematically review original user evaluations of patient information displays relevant to critical care and understand the impact of design frameworks and information presentation approaches on decision-making, efficiency, workload, and preferences of clinicians. Methods: We included studies that evaluated information displays designed to support real-time care decisions in critical care or anesthesiology using simulated tasks. We searched PubMed and IEEExplore from 1/1/1990 to 6/30/2018. The search strategy was developed iteratively with calibration against known references. Inclusion screening was completed independently by two authors. Extraction of display features, design processes, and evaluation method was completed by one and verified by a second author. Results: Fifty-six manuscripts evaluating 32 critical care and 22 anesthesia displays were included. Primary outcome metrics included clinician accuracy and efficiency in recognizing, diagnosing, and treating problems. Implementing user-centered design (UCD) processes, especially iterative evaluation and redesign, resulted in positive impact in outcomes such as accuracy and efficiency. Innovative display approaches that led to improved human-system performance in critical care included: (1) improving the integration and organization of information, (2) improving the representation of trend information, and (3) implementing graphical approaches to make relationships between data visible. Conclusion: Our review affirms the value of key principles of UCD. Improved information presentation can facilitate faster information interpretation and more accurate diagnoses and treatment. Improvements to information organization and support for rapid interpretation of time-based relationships between related quantitative data is warranted. Designers and developers are encouraged to involve users in formal iterative design and evaluation activities in the design of electronic health records (EHRs), clinical informatics applications, and clinical devices. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Capacitive deionization (CDI), an emerging desalination technology, has received considerable attention in recent years due to porous carbon development, new cell designs, and unique operational modes providing higher performance for capacitance-based salt removal. The energy cost of this separation process has also been rigorously evaluated through a variety of efficiency calculations, and direct comparisons are now being made with more conventional membrane-based separation systems. Currently, the thermodynamic energy efficiency (TEE) of CDI is quite low with values typically below 5%, although there are examples where this efficiency can reach 10% or higher under the proper conditions. As the development of CDI and analogous capacitive processes continue, the TEE should remain a metric for comparison to conventional techniques. In addition, the ability of CDI to perform selective separations for trace compounds, resource recovery, and contaminant removal should be more heavily investigated. © 2019},

abstract={The operation of an outdoor membrane photobioreactor plant which treated the effluent of an anaerobic membrane bioreactor was optimised. Biomass retention times of 4.5, 6, and 9 days were tested. At a biomass retention time of 4.5 days, maximum nitrogen recovery rate:light irradiance ratios, photosynthetic efficiencies and carbon biofixations of 51.7 ± 14.3 mg N·mol−1, 4.4 ± 1.6% and 0.50 ± 0.05 kg CO2·m3 influent, respectively, were attained. Minimum membrane fouling rates were achieved when operating at the shortest biomass retention time because of the lower solid concentration and the negligible amount of cyanobacteria and protozoa. Hydraulic retention times of 3.5, 2, and 1.5 days were tested at the optimum biomass retention times of 4.5 days under non-nutrient limited conditions, showing no significant differences in the nutrient recovery rates, photosynthetic efficiencies and membrane fouling rates. However, nitrogen recovery rate:light irradiance ratios and photosynthetic efficiency significantly decreased when hydraulic retention time was further shortened to 1 day, probably due to a rise in the substrate turbidity which reduced the light availability in the culture. Optimal carbon biofixations and theoretical energy recoveries from the biomass were obtained at hydraulic retention time of 3.5 days, which accounted for 0.55 ± 0.05 kg CO2·m−3 influent and 0.443 ± 0.103 kWh·m−3 influent, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Biological removal of organics, nitrogen and from saline wastewaters is adversely impacted by high salinity, which can be a major concern for treatment of industrial or domestic saline wastewater. In anaerobic treatment systems, sulfidogensis, especially when treating sulfate-rich saline wastewaters (e.g. seawater has 930 mgSO4-S L−1, or 2800 mg L−1 as SO42−) can cause additional biological, operational, and safety issues, due to H2S toxicity. Here, the use of anaerobic purple phototrophic bacteria (PPB) is tested as mediator to treat high salinity domestic wastewater (NaCl), and marine wastewater (Red Sea Salt - high sulfate, potassium, etc.) in a continuous anaerobic infra-red photo bioreactor, operated over 372d. Saline adapted PPB simultaneously removed COD, nitrogen and phosphorus with biomass yields of 0.8 gCOD gCOD−1. Batch activity tests found a broad optimum peak for saline adapted PPB between 30 and 70 mS cm−1, and 50% reduced activity at 140 mS cm−1 (3.5x seawater). For marine wastewater, high sulfate influent concentrations (770 mgSO4-S L−1) did not result in substantial H2S production (&lt;1.6 mgS L−1) over 80 d. When irradiation was removed, sulfide rapidly rose to &gt;90 mgS L−1 and the process failed. The results indicate rapid adaptation to high-salt conditions (both NaCl and marine), and the capacity for PPB to form a combined wastewater treatment/resource recovery process, particularly for salty industrial wastewater. © 2019},

abstract={A growing number of companies have started commercializing low-cost sensors (LCS) that are said to be able to monitor air pollution in outdoor air. The benefit of the use of LCS is the increased spatial coverage when monitoring air quality in cities and remote locations. Today, there are hundreds of LCS commercially available on the market with costs ranging from several hundred to several thousand euro. At the same time, the scientific literature currently reports independent evaluation of the performance of LCS against reference measurements for about 110 LCS. These studies report that LCS are unstable and often affected by atmospheric conditions-cross-sensitivities from interfering compounds that may change LCS performance depending on site location. In this work, quantitative data regarding the performance of LCS against reference measurement are presented. This information was gathered from published reports and relevant testing laboratories. Other information was drawn from peer-reviewed journals that tested different types of LCS in research studies. Relevant metrics about the comparison of LCS systems against reference systems highlighted the most cost-effective LCS that could be used to monitor air quality pollutants with a good level of agreement represented by a coefficient of determination R2 &gt; 0.75 and slope close to 1.0. This review highlights the possibility to have versatile LCS able to operate with multiple pollutants and preferably with transparent LCS data treatment. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Various approaches have been proposed to model PM2.5 in the recent decade, with satellite-derived aerosol optical depth, land-use variables, chemical transport model predictions, and several meteorological variables as major predictor variables. Our study used an ensemble model that integrated multiple machine learning algorithms and predictor variables to estimate daily PM2.5 at a resolution of 1 km × 1 km across the contiguous United States. We used a generalized additive model that accounted for geographic difference to combine PM2.5 estimates from neural network, random forest, and gradient boosting. The three machine learning algorithms were based on multiple predictor variables, including satellite data, meteorological variables, land-use variables, elevation, chemical transport model predictions, several reanalysis datasets, and others. The model training results from 2000 to 2015 indicated good model performance with a 10-fold cross-validated R2 of 0.86 for daily PM2.5 predictions. For annual PM2.5 estimates, the cross-validated R2 was 0.89. Our model demonstrated good performance up to 60 μg/m3. Using trained PM2.5 model and predictor variables, we predicted daily PM2.5 from 2000 to 2015 at every 1 km × 1 km grid cell in the contiguous United States. We also used localized land-use variables within 1 km × 1 km grids to downscale PM2.5 predictions to 100 m × 100 m grid cells. To characterize uncertainty, we used meteorological variables, land-use variables, and elevation to model the monthly standard deviation of the difference between daily monitored and predicted PM2.5 for every 1 km × 1 km grid cell. This PM2.5 prediction dataset, including the downscaled and uncertainty predictions, allows epidemiologists to accurately estimate the adverse health effect of PM2.5. Compared with model performance of individual base learners, an ensemble model would achieve a better overall estimation. It is worth exploring other ensemble model formats to synthesize estimations from different models or from different groups to improve overall performance. © 2019},

abstract={This study investigated the role of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent and an abandoned coastal landfill as pathways for microplastics (MPs) input into the marine environment. MPs were first analyzed in raw sewage influent, sludge and effluent samples, and their fate was studied along a distance gradient from the WWTP in three matrices: surface water, sediments and wild mussels. All suspected MPs were characterized according to their polymer nature using micro-Raman spectroscopy. The investigated WWTP had an estimated daily discharge of 227 million MPs. MPs were found in all matrices with a decreasing abundance from the effluent. Strong MPs abundances (higher than those found near the WWTP effluent) were observed in the vicinity of the coastal landfill suggesting its importance as a MPs entry route into the marine coastal environment. Our study supports the idea that blue mussels are a promising sentinel species for MPs (<200 μm). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Cyclophilins are ubiquitous proteins and constitute a large family, with several members possessing peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity that is essential for cis-trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bond. However, information on the cyclophilin gene family in wheat is lacking. In silico analysis of the recently available wheat genome sequence from the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) resulted in identification of 83 different wheat cyclophilin genes that encode 85 different proteins ranging between 17 kDa to 92 kDa. While 58 TaCYPs are single domain proteins and consist of a single cyclophilin-like domain, 27 cyclophilins also contain additional domains including the F-box and PAN domains. The TaCYPs are predicted to be localized to cytosol (28), chloroplasts (22), nucleus (19) mitochondria (9), secretory system (4) and endoplasmic reticulum (3). Besides the open reading frame, the introns are also present in the 5′ and 3'untranslated regions of all but eleven cyclophilin genes. The distribution patterns of TaCYPs on the chromosomes strongly suggest that there are segmental, ectopic and tandem duplications in addition to whole genome duplications. This study also revealed that expression of cyclophilin genes in wheat is differentially modulated under heat stress, suggesting their role in thermotolerance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Revealing the landscape of epigenetic changes in cells during differentiation is important for understanding the development of organisms. In this study, to infer such epigenetic changes during human hematopoiesis, ancestral state estimation based on a phylogenetic tree was applied to map the epigenomic changes in six kinds of histone modifications onto the hierarchical cell differentiation process of hematopoiesis using epigenomes of eight types of differentiated hematopoietic cells. The histone modification changes inferred during hematopoiesis showed that changes that occurred on the branches separating different cell types reflected the characteristics of hematopoiesis in terms of genomic position and gene function. These results suggested that ancestral state estimation based on phylogenetic analysis of histone modifications in differentiated hematopoietic cells could reconstruct an appropriate landscape of histone modification changes during hematopoiesis. Since integration of the inferred changes of different histone modifications could reveal genes with specific histone marks such as active histone marks and bivalent histone marks on each internal branch of cell-type trees, this approach could provide valuable information for understanding the cell differentiation steps of each cell lineage. © 2019 The Author},

abstract={Background: Energy restriction induces adaptations in resting energy expenditure (REE)and physical activity; inter-individual variability could be ascribed to genetic predisposition. The aim was to examine if changes in REE and physical activity as a result of weight loss were affected by candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Methods: 148 subjects (39 men, 109 women), mean ± SD age: 41 ± 9 year; body mass index (BMI): 31.9 ± 3.0 kg/m2, followed a very low energy diet for 8 weeks. SNPs were selected from six candidate genes: ADRB2, FTO, MC4R, PPARG2, PPARD and PPARGC1A. REE (ventilated hood)and physical activity (tri-axial accelerometer)were assessed before and after the diet. General linear modelling included gender, age and additional relevant covariates for all parameters. Results: The heterozygotic genotype of FTO was associated with a higher amount of physical activity (1.71 Mcounts/d; CI 1.62–1.81)compared to the homozygotic major genotype (1.50 Mcounts/d; CI 1.40–1.59)(P &lt; 0.001)while the homozygotic risk allele genotype was not different (1.56 Mcounts/d; CI 1.39–1.74)at baseline; moreover, a similar pattern was observed after energy restriction. Carrying the homozygotic minor genotype of ADRB2 was associated with a larger decrease in REE (P &lt; 0.05)and greater adaptive thermogenesis (P &lt; 0.05)after weight loss. Conclusion: Carrying the minor ADRB2 allele homozygous was associated with a larger diet induced metabolic adaptation in energy expenditure and suggest a central role for reduced lipid mobilization. Carrying the risk allele of FTO homozygous was not associated with lower physical activity at baseline or after weight loss. Heterozygous carriers of one FTO risk allele showed greater physical activity before and after weight loss which might protect them in part from the higher obesity risk associated with FTO. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={More than half of the world's population now lives in cities as a result of unprecedented urbanization during the second half of the 20th century. The urban population is projected to increase to 68% by 2050, with most of the increase occurring in Asia and Africa. Population growth and increased energy consumption in urban areas lead to high levels of atmospheric pollutants that harm human health, cause regional haze, damage crops, contribute to climate change, and ultimately threaten the society's sustainability. This article reviews the air quality and compares the policies implemented in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) and Singapore and offers insights into the complexity of managing air pollution to protect public health and the environment. While the differences in the governance, economics, and culture of the two cities greatly influence the decision-making process, both have made much progress in reducing concentrations of harmful pollutants by implementing comprehensive integrated air quality management programs. The experience and the lessons learned from the MCMA and Singapore can be valuable for other urban centers, especially in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region confronting similar air pollution problems. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Vitiligo is the most common skin pigmentation disorder which affects around 1% of the population worldwide. The disease has complex pathogenesis and is of multifactorial etiology, that finally culminates in patchy depigmentation of skin. Genetic contribution to the disease is well studied, however the information about multiple associated genes and contributing variations are scattered across the literature. To address this complex disorder affecting the skin, we systematically cataloged the genes and variations by creating a Locus Specific Database for vitiligo called, “VitiVar”. This comprehensive resource houses manually curated 322 genes and 254 variations, from 202 articles indexed in PubMed. We applied an integrative approach to stratify genes and variations to facilitate dissection of vitiligo pathogenesis by layering it with expression status in specific constituent cell types of skin and in-house vitiligo expression data. Finally, we were able to demonstrate the utility of VitiVar by generating a vitiligo interactome using GeneMANIA and overlaying the vitiligo and cell type specific information. This interaction network yielded 20 new genes (apart from 322 VitiVar genes)of which we were able to prioritize IFI27 and IFI6 for further validation. This, thereby makes VitiVar a comprehensive integrative platform in unravelling disease biology by providing meaningful leads for functional interrogation. VitiVar is freely accessible to the research community for prioritizing and validating the candidate genes and variations (https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__vitivar.igib.res.in_&d=DwIGaQ&c=sJ6xIWYx-zLMB3EPkvcnVg&r=hPRQO-QHqXhD8p9F43Mezw&m=5Ygbn-ChjRk5z0uQS3lymjWAtJDFin15cLna7hnk9fc&s=6fPRVXYSbd9iNLCasUYa8cltqgV0F0zjnEmJ3xqIiy4&e= ). © 2019},

abstract={This study investigates a desalination system based on a humidification-dehumidification process driven by solar modules and proposes a solution within the framework of equilibrium theory. Although the optimal operation of the considered humidification-dehumidification system has been investigated in the past and despite the simplifications and assumptions characterizing equilibrium theory, the proposed solution provides a thorough understanding of the system operation, which has not been obtained yet. First, it allows an explanation of the asymmetry between the humidifier and the dehumidifier, which results not from mass transport limitations but from the functional dependence of the enthalpy of moist air on temperature, which in turn depends on the functional dependence of the saturation pressure of air. On the one hand, humidifying air becomes easier when the temperature increases, leading to simple wave interactions, to the corresponding smooth transitions, and to greater entropy generation in the humidifier. On the other hand, dehumidifying air becomes more difficult when the temperature decreases, leading to shock interactions, to the corresponding sharp transitions, and to smaller entropy generation in the dehumidifier. Then, it allows description of the behavior of the overall system (i.e., considering the solar modules connecting the dehumidifier and humidifier). Optimal system operation is defined by determining the air-to-water mass flow rate ratio that maximizes the productivity of fresh water for any value of ambient conditions and saline water inlet temperature. Such a maximum productivity curve separates low-productivity and high-productivity regions, with a discontinuity causing a sudden drop in productivity occurring when going from the latter to the former. Such a discontinuity is well explained by equilibrium theory in terms of the operating regimes of the humidifier and dehumidifier. Finally, equilibrium theory is used to derive an analytical approximation of the optimal operating curve. Such an analytical form describes well the actual solution, particularly within the boundary conditions of interest, and provides an immediate tool for easily determining the optimal system operation. © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={To study the impact of fireworks (FW) events on air quality, aerosol particles from FW displays were measured using a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) and collocated instruments during the Independence Day (July 4, 2017) holiday period at Albany, NY, U.S.A. The FW influenced periods were identified using potassium ion (K+) signals in the aerosol mass spectra. The FW influenced peak mass concentration of submicron particles (PM1, or particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 1 μm) measured at the uptown site (approximately 8 km from the FW launch location) was 61.8 μg m-3. The Independence Day FW events resulted in significant increases in concentrations of both organic and inorganic chemical components, including potassium, sulfate, and chloride. An FW-related oxidized organic aerosol factor (FW-OOA) was identified during the most intense FW event of the measurement period. The intense emission of FW particles from the Independence Day celebration contributed about 77% (36.3 μg m-3) of total PM1 (47.0 μg m-3) measured at the uptown site during Independence Day FW significantly influenced period (07/04 23:00-07/05 03:00). A collocated wind LiDAR at the uptown site measured atmospheric transport characteristics during the night of July 4/5. The low observed winds and high aerosol emissions highlight the significant episodic influence of FW burning on fine aerosol mass concentration and chemical characteristics while large numbers of people were clustered together and breathing the outdoor air. © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={A pilot study took place at Whiteface Mountain (WFM) in the Adirondacks of upstate New York during the summer of 2017 to evaluate the chemical processing of aerosol within clouds. Below-cloud and cloud interstitial submicron aerosols were characterized in real-time using an Aerodyne High Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) and other instruments deployed via the Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC) sprinter van mobile laboratory. The primary observation is a dominance of organic aerosol mass, averaging 66%-78% of PM2.5 during urban-influenced periods and 83-93% during biogenic-influenced periods, in stark contrast to observations in the northeastern U.S. in past decades when sulfate dominated the aerosol mass. The observations also show chemical differences between the below-cloud layer, the transition layer (just below-cloud), and the in-cloud layer. Comparison between these layers revealed enhanced inorganic nitrate in interstitial aerosol sampled in the transition and in-cloud layers compared to the below-cloud aerosol. Enhanced particle nitrate mass concentrations were more significant during urban influenced cloud events than biogenic influenced ones. The below-cloud and transition layer aerosols were characterized by similar bimodal number and mass size distributions, and when entrained into the cloud, aerosols with number mean dry diameters of &gt; ∼50 nm were incorporated into cloud droplets, suggesting that cloud supersaturations at WFM can be quite high (&gt;0.6%). The organic component of the interstitial aerosols in the transition and in-cloud layers is slightly less oxidized than the below-cloud aerosol. The hygroscopicity parameter (κ), as determined from size-resolved cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) measurements at water vapor supersaturations ranging from 0.23% to 0.78%, was 0.13-0.19 throughout the majority of the pilot study. Exceptions were two of the five urban-influenced periods (with κ values of 0.27-0.33) and at the lowest supersaturation (0.23%) for two of the three biogenic-influenced periods (with κ values of 0.23-0.25), the latter of which may be attributed to greater accumulation of soluble aerosol mass during aqueous/cloud processing of larger particles. The hygroscopicity of the organic component was estimated to range from 0.08 to 0.22, and was well correlated with the organic oxidation state. The below-cloud and cloud interstitial aerosol observations shown here comprise an important part of the 2017 pilot study at WFM. These observations also provide a baseline for future intensive field campaigns focused on cloud processing at WFM, which will ultimately inform atmospheric models to better simulate cloud processing in the northeastern U.S in comparison to other biogenic-dominated locations. © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={We introduce a free and open-source software package (PES-Learn) which largely automates the process of producing high-quality machine learning models of molecular potential energy surfaces (PESs). PES-Learn incorporates a generalized framework for producing grid points across a PES that is compatible with most electronic structure theory software. The newly generated or externally supplied PES data can then be used to train and optimize neural network or Gaussian process models in a completely automated fashion. Robust hyperparameter optimization schemes designed specifically for molecular PES applications are implemented to ensure that the best possible model for the data set is fit with high quality. The performance of PES-Learn toward fitting a few semiglobal PESs from the literature is evaluated.

abstract={Introduction: Information on immunization delivery costs (IDCs) is essential for better planning and budgeting for the sustainability and performance of national programs. However, delivery cost evidence is fragmented and of variable quality, making it difficult for policymakers, planners, and other stakeholders to understand and use. This study aimed to consolidate and summarize the evidence on delivery costs, answering the question: What are the unit costs of vaccine delivery across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and through a variety of delivery strategies? Methods: We conducted a systematic review of over 15,000 published and unpublished resources from 2005 to 2018 that included IDCs in LMICs. We quality-rated and extracted data from 61 resources that contained 410 immunization delivery unit costs (e.g., cost per dose, cost per fully immunized child). We converted cost findings to a common year (2016) and currency (U.S. dollars) to ensure comparability across studies and settings. We performed a descriptive and gap analysis and developed immunization delivery cost ranges using comparable unit costs for single vaccines and schedules of vaccines. Results: The majority of IDC evidence comes from low-income countries and Sub-Saharan Africa. Most unit costs are presented as cost per dose and represent health facility-based delivery. Discussion: The cost ranges may be higher than current estimates used in many LMICs for budgeting: $0.16–$2.54 incremental cost per dose (including economic, financial, and fiscal costs) for single, newly introduced vaccines, and $0.75–$9.45 full cost per dose (economic costs) for schedules of four to eight vaccines delivered to children under one. Conclusions: Despite increased attention on improving coverage and strengthening immunization delivery, evidence on the cost of delivery is nascent but growing. The cost ranges can inform planning and policymaking, but should be used with caution given their width and the few unit costs used in their development. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Background: Enumerating dog populations is essential to plan and evaluate rabies vaccination campaigns. To estimate vaccination coverage and dog population size in a Haitian commune, 15 sight-resight counts were conducted over two days following a government-sponsored vaccination campaign. Methods: Dogs received temporary laminated collars and livestock wax marks on the head and sides at the time of rabies vaccination. After the vaccination campaign, pairs of surveyors walked pre-defined routes through targeted neighborhoods, photographing and recording characteristics and location of each dog seen on a standardized data sheet. On the second survey day, surveyors retraced the prior day's track, followed the same procedure, and indicated in addition whether they believed the dogs were resighted from the prior day. After completion of the field survey, two independent evaluators reviewed photographs and characteristics of each dog to assess which had vaccination marks and which were resighted. Surveyor and photo-reviewer sight-resight decisions were compared using Cohen's kappa, and population estimates were compared using Lincoln-Petersen 95% confidence intervals. Results: Field-surveyors identified dogs consistent with the photograph evaluations in 629 out of 800 instances (78.6%, Cohen's kappa of 0.12). Despite this inconsistency, the population estimates resulting from the field and final determinations were not significantly different at 1,789 (95% CI 1,677 to 1,901) and 1,978 (95% CI 1,839 to 2,118). Vaccination coverage was also the same at 55% and 56%; however, an observed vaccination mark loss of 13.8% suggests that the true coverage may have been closer to 64%. Conclusion: Using photos improved dog identification during the sight-resight study, leading to a higher population estimate. Despite using a 2-mark system to temporarily identify vaccinated dogs, a significant proportion had lost all identifying marks by the second day of field surveys. Efforts to estimate vaccination coverage using sight-resight surveys should consider improvement of marking techniques or better accounting for potential loss of marks in their free-roaming dog vaccination coverage assessments. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Market shaping for health products used in lower-income countries strives to benefit public health. As a funder of vaccines, Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) has goals for its market shaping efforts, achieved through a strategy developed and implemented by the Gavi Secretariat, UNICEF, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). A case-study of Gavi's fifteen-year engagement with a vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and haemophilus influenzae type b (pentavalent) provides evidence of the benefits and potential risks of trying to influence markets. During 2001–18, Gavi disbursed US$3.5 billion to support use of 50 million pentavalent doses annually before 2005, increasing to ∼300 million doses annually by 2016. During this time, eight manufacturers invested in vaccine development and manufacturing and the first two manufacturers have subsequently ceased production. Following its strategy, Gavi implemented coordinated market interventions including technical assistance to manufacturers, improving market information transparency, risk-sharing agreements and innovative procurement aiming to stimulate and capitalize on a competitive market. In 2018 supply allows ∼80 million children per year to be immunised, a sixteen-fold increase from 2005, with vaccine-related costs per child for donors and countries of one-quarter the 2005 level. Lessons learned include the importance of frameworks and strategies; the need to adjust interventions with changing conditions; the important role of manufacturers; and the potentially powerful effects of interconnected markets. This case study is limited by its focus on a single health product in a specific market, however the lessons can inform other market shaping efforts when taken in context. While countries and children have improved vaccine access, risks of financial sustainability and continued manufacturer investment in Gavi vaccine markets are being monitored. Gavi should continue implementing a market shaping strategy, adjust with market conditions and expect and measure unintended consequences. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Vaccination status is conventionally measured by up-to-date coverage. This method does not take in to account whether the vaccines were received at the correct age and interval which is essential for optimal disease protection. Sri Lanka – a lower middle-income country in the Indian Ocean, has previously presented with high vaccination coverage for all childhood vaccines. However, few studies investigating timeliness of vaccinations have until now been carried out in Sri Lanka. Aim: This study was carried out to investigate the individual coverage and age appropriateness of vaccination, in two different demographic settings in Anuradhapura district, Sri Lanka. The study of cross-sectional descriptive design included 633 children born in 2011. Public Health Midwives kept hand-written documentation of the birth and vaccination dates on each child in her geographic area. Vaccination ages were then compared to the timelines of vaccination provided by the Epidemiology Unit of Sri Lanka. The vaccination coverage for all antigens was 97.5% (94.2–99.7%) at age 5–6 years. Timeliness of doses was between 65.0 and 88.6 % (median 80.7%; 65.0–88.6) and significantly lower in the urban population compared to the rural. The present study shows that the vaccine coverage in both urban and rural areas in Sri Lanka was high and that the timeliness predominantly followed national recommendations. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Introduction: Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) shortages and evidence of improved immunogenicity of two intradermal (ID) fractional IPV (fIPV) doses compared with one full intramuscular dose led to recommendations for fIPV delivery. To provide evidence on the economics of fIPV, we estimated the cost per child vaccinated using full-dose IPV compared with fIPV in routine and campaign settings. We evaluated the impact on costs of alternative devices facilitating ID administration, vaccine vial sizes, and prices. Methods: We used an Excel-based model to estimate the commodity and delivery costs for providing IPV. Commodity costs included vaccine price per dose adjusted for wastage, prices for vaccine administration devices, and safety boxes. Delivery costs included storage costs at each level of the supply chain, transport costs for commodities between levels, and human resource costs for vaccine administration. Model inputs were obtained from various databases and published literature. All costs are reported in 2018 US dollars. Results: In both campaign and routine settings, fIPV had a lower cost per child vaccinated than full dosing, despite the assumed higher vaccine wastage with fIPV in routine settings, and even when novel ID administration devices were used. In routine settings, costs per child fully vaccinated with fractional doses were 15% to 48% lower than those with full-dose delivery across different vial sizes. The cost per child vaccinated ranged from $1.84 to $2.65 for fractional doses, depending on the administration device, compared with $3.57 for full dose, when using 5-dose vials. The magnitude of cost reductions with fIPV relative to full-dose IPV was largest with smaller vial sizes and higher vaccine price. Conclusion: Adopting fIPV can reduce costs per child vaccinated compared with using full doses, especially as IPV prices increase in the short term and more so when two full doses could be recommended in the future. © 2019},

abstract={Background: Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) has been part of the Danish Childhood Vaccination Programme (CVP) since 2009 and initially had a high uptake. Following an intense public debate on the alleged side-effects to the vaccine in 2015, coverage rates declined dramatically leaving the current coverage at 54%. The main aim of this study was to identify differences in the sources of information and factors of importance in mothers’ decision to have or not to have their adolescent daughters vaccinated against HPV. Methods: This cross-sectional study was based on survey and register data from 3,558 mothers of daughters born in 2003 living in the Central Denmark Region. The survey examined, among others, sources of information and factors of value in the decision-making process. Socioeconomic register data were retrieved from Statistics Denmark. Pearson's chi-squared test was used to determine differences in socioeconomic distribution between both respondents and non-respondents, and mothers who had their daughters vaccinated versus those who did not. Associations between vaccination status and various events were estimated using logistic regression. Results: A strong association was found between vaccine uptake and general practitioner (GP) recommendation (odds ratio (OR) 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.10; 0.30), seeking GP guidance (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.50; 0.78) and agreeing with the daughter's father to vaccinate (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37; 0.96). Inversely, vaccination decline was associated with a negative first impression of HPV vaccination (OR 4.05, 95% CI 3.28; 5.00), valuing media stories (OR 3.57, 95% CI 2.63; 4.85) and distrusting the first source of information (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.92; 3.23). Conclusions: The results indicate that the impression left behind by information sources is more important in determining vaccination status than the information sources themselves, indicating that mothers are liable to make healthcare decisions based on sensibility rather than sense. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Bluetongue is a severe, economically important disease of ruminants that is widely distributed in tropical and temperate regions around the world. It is associated with major production losses, restrictions of animal movements and trade, as well as costs associated with developing and implementing effective surveillance and control measures. Mammalian hosts infected with bluetongue virus (BTV) generate a protective neutralising antibody response targeting the major BTV outer-capsid protein and serotype-specific antigen, VP2. BTV VP2 proteins that have been expressed in plants are soluble, with a native conformation displaying neutralising epitopes and can assemble with other BTV structural proteins to form virus-like particles (VLPs). His-tagged VP2 proteins of BTV serotypes 4 and 8 were transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana then purified by immobilised metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Antisera from IFNAR −/− mice prime/boost vaccinated with the purified proteins, were shown to contain VP2-specific antibodies by Indirect ELISA (I-ELISA), western blotting and serum neutralisation tests (SNT). Vaccinated mice, subsequently challenged with either the homologous or heterologous BTV serotype, developed viraemia by day 3 post-infection. However, no clinical signs were observed in mice challenged with the homologous serotype (either prime-boost or single-shot vaccinated), all of which survived for the duration of the study. In contrast, all of the vaccinated mice challenged with a heterologous serotype, died, showing no evidence of cross-protection or suppression of viraemia, as detected by real-time RT-qPCR or virus isolation. The induction of protective, serotype-specific neutralising antibodies in IFNAR −/− mice, indicates potential for the use of plant-expressed BTV VP2s as subunit vaccine components, or as a basis for serotype-specific serological assays. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The recent reduction of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) effectiveness in multivalent formulations was particularly associated with the A(H1N1)pdm09 component. In the 2017 the WHO vaccine composition committee changed its recommendations for the A(H1N1)pdm09 component to include an A/Michigan/45/2015-like virus. We evaluated effectiveness and quality of newly developed and previous A(H1N1)pdm09 LAIV reassortants through assessment of their thermal and pH stability, receptor binding specificity and replication fitness in primary human airway epithelial cells of nasal origin (hAECN). Our analysis showed that LAIV expressed hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) from an A/Michigan/45/2015-like strain A/New York/61/2015 (A/New York/61/2015-CDC-LV16A, NY-LV16A), exhibit higher thermal and pH stability compared to the previous vaccine candidates expressing HA and NA from A/California/07/2009 and A/Bolivia/559/2013 (A17/Cal09 and A17/Bol13). Reassortants A/South Africa/3626/2013-CDC-LV14A (SA-LV14A) and NY-LV16A showed preferential binding to α2,6 sialic acid (SA) receptors and replicated at higher titers and more extensively in hAECN compared to A17/Cal09 and A17/Bol13, which had an α2,3 SA receptor binding preference. Our data analysis supports selection of A/New York/61/2015-CDC-LV16A for LAIV formulation and the introduction of new assays for LAIV characterization. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={This study demonstrates that modulation of IL-25 and IL-33 cytokines responsible for innate lymphoid cell 2 (ILC2) activation/function can differentially regulate ILC profiles at the vaccination site, in a vaccine route-dependent manner. Specifically, recombinant fowlpox (rFPV) vector-based vaccine co-expressing an adjuvant that transiently sequestered IL-25 (FPV-HIV-IL-25 binding protein), delivered intramuscularly (i.m.) was able to induce significantly lower IL-25R+ ILC2-deived IL-13 and ILC1/ILC3-derived IFN-γ expression with significantly elevated IL-17A in muscle. In contrast, intranasal (i.n.) delivery was able to induce all three known ILC2 subsets (ST2/IL-33R+, IL-25R+, and TSLPR+ ILC2) to express varying amounts of IL-13 in lung, and also the TSLPR+ ILC2 to express IL-4, unlike the unadjuvanted control, which only showed ST2/IL-33R+ ILC2 to express IL-13. Interestingly, the sequestration of IL-25 in lung also induced a unique lineage− ST2/IL-33R− IL-25R− TSLPR− ILC2 population to express elevated IL-13 and IL-4. Moreover, both i.m. and, i.n. FPV-HIV-IL-25BP vaccination induced significantly elevated ILC1/ILC3-derived IL-17A in lung, indicating that ILC2 could directly impact ILC1/ILC3 activity. To our surprise, transient sequestration of IL-33 at the lung mucosae did not alter the lung ILC2 profiles or activity. These inhibitor studies showed that in the context of i.n. viral vector vaccination, IL-25 plays a predominant role in early ILC development/regulation than IL-33, and likely acts as a master regulator of ILC. Our previous findings have indicated that level of IL-4/IL-13 at the vaccination site impacts the quality/avidity of T cell immunity. Taken together data suggest that IL-25 binding protein could be used as an effective i.m. not an i.n. adjuvant to enhance quality of vaccine-specific T cell immunity. These findings evoke the notion that route-dependent manipulation of ILCs according to the target pathogen could be exploited to design more effective vaccines against chronic pathogens in the future. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus. The pandemic outbreak of influenza A H1N1 in 2009 (H1N1pdm09) gave us a unique opportunity to study humoral immune responses to a novel influenza vaccine strain. Here, we investigate how an individual's previous encounter with different influenza subtypes influences the humoral response after pandemic vaccination in 2009. We retrospectively chose and grouped 80 vaccinated healthcare workers (HCWs) based on their year of birth into 4 groups, reflecting which influenza subtype they were likely first exposed to during childhood. Pre- and 21 days post- vaccination sera were analyzed. We investigated antibodies to the major surface protein hemagglutinin (HA), and specifically antibodies binding to the conserved stalk domain of the HA-protein. Serological assays were used to assess the quantity and functionality of the influenza-specific antibodies, including virus neutralization and activation of natural killer (NK) cells involved in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The AS03-adjuvanted H1N1pdm09 vaccine elicited robust antibody responses in all groups of HCWs. We found that the more antigenically experienced individuals had higher pre-vaccination antibody-levels towards the stalk domain of the HA. We also demonstrated that despite their inferior pre-vaccination antibody levels, the younger individuals reached similar antibody levels as the older birth-cohorts after pandemic vaccination. Our findings are important for understanding the effect of AS03 adjuvant on the antibody response in individuals exposed to different influenza viruses during their early childhood years, which is crucial for developing vaccine strategies against influenza. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The human papillomavirus (HPV) 9-valent, recombinant vaccine (Gardasil™9) helps protect young adults (males and females) against anogenital cancers and genital warts caused by certain HPV genotypes (ref. Gardasil™9 insert). This vaccine is administered intramuscularly (IM). The aim of this study was to determine preclinically whether intradermal (ID) vaccination with an unadjuvanted 9-valent recombinant HPV vaccine using a first-generation ID delivery device, the Nanopatch™, could enhance vaccine immunogenicity compared with the traditional ID route (Mantoux technique). IM injection of HPV VLPs formulated with Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA Alum Adjuvant (MAA) were included in the rhesus study for comparison. The Nanopatch™ prototype contains a high-density array comprised of 10,000 microprojections/cm2, each 250 µm long. It was hypothesized the higher density array with shallower ID delivery may be superior to the Mantoux technique. To test this hypothesis, HPV VLPs without adjuvant were coated on the Nanopatch™, stability of the Nanopatch™ with unadjuvanted HPV VLPs were evaluated under accelerated conditions, skin delivery was verified using radiolabelled VLPs or FluoSpheres®, and the immune response and skin site reaction with the Nanopatch™ was evaluated in rhesus macaques. The immune response induced by Nanopatch™ administration, measured as HPV-specific binding antibodies, was similar to that induced using the Mantoux technique. It was also observed that a lower dose of unadjuvanted HPV VLPs delivered with the first-generation Nanopatch™ and applicator or Mantoux technique resulted in an immune response that was significantly lower compared to a higher-dose of alum adjuvanted HPV VLPs delivered IM in rhesus macaques. The study also indicated unadjuvanted HPV VLPs could be delivered with the first-generation Nanopatch™ and applicator to the skin in 15 s with a transfer efficiency of approximately 20%. This study is the first demonstration of patch administration in non-human primates with a vaccine composed of HPV VLPs. © 2019},

abstract={Introduction: The World Health Organization recommends vaccination of health workers (HWs) against influenza, but low uptake is intransigent. We conducted a Rapid Evidence Appraisal on: the risk of influenza in HWs, transmission risk from HWs to patients, the benefit of HW vaccination, and strategies for improving uptake. We aimed to capture a ‘whole-of-system’ perspective to consider possible benefits for HWs, employers and patients. Methods: We executed a comprehensive search of the available literature published from 2006 to 2018 in the English language. We developed search terms for seven separate questions following the PICO framework (population, intervention, comparators, outcomes) and queried nine databases. Results: Of 3784 publications identified, 52 met inclusion criteria. Seven addressed HW influenza risk, of which four found increased risk; 15 addressed influenza vaccine benefit to HWs or their employers, of which 10 found benefit; 11 addressed influenza transmission from HWs to patients, of which 6 found evidence for transmission; 12 unique studies addressed whether vaccinating HWs produced patient benefit, of which 9 concluded benefits accrued. Regarding the number of HWs needed to vaccinate (NNV) to deliver patient benefit, NNV estimates ranged from 3 to 36,000 but were in significant disagreement. Fourteen studies provided insights on strategies to improve uptake; the strongest evidence was for mandatory vaccination. Conclusions: The evidence on most questions related to influenza vaccination in HWs is mixed and often of low-quality. Substantial heterogeneity exists in terms of study designs and settings, making comparison between studies difficult. Notwithstanding these limitations, a majority of studies suggests that influenza vaccination benefit HWs and their employers; and HWs are implicated in transmission events. The effects of vaccinating HWs on patient morbidity and mortality may include reductions in all-cause mortality and influenza-like illness (ILI). Taken together, the evidence suggests that HW vaccination is an important policy for HWs themselves, their employers, and their patients. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={While diarrhea mortality in children has declined over the last two decades, there has been a slower decline in diarrheal episodes. Repeated diarrheal episodes are associated with childhood stunting, which leads to increased mortality risk from infectious diseases. Vaccine candidates are under development for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli [ETEC] and Shigella, important enteric pathogens in children in low income countries. These future vaccines could significantly reduce diarrheal burden, prevent ETEC- and Shigella-induced stunting, and stunting-associated mortality. We developed a cost-effectiveness model for two putative standalone ETEC and Shigella vaccine candidates to evaluate vaccine impact on mortality, morbidity, stunting, and stunting-associated deaths from other infectious diseases. We modeled impact over the first ten years after vaccine introduction in children under five years old living in 79 low and low-middle income countries. ETEC and Shigella diarrhea would cause an estimated 239,300 [95% UL: 179,700–309,800] and 340,300 [256,500–440,800] child deaths, respectively, from years 2025 to 2034. Most of these deaths would occur in AFRO countries. ETEC and Shigella moderate-to-severe diarrheal episodes would result in over 13.7 [8.4–19.0] and 21.4 [13.1–29.8] million stunted children, respectively. Introducing ETEC or Shigella vaccine each with 60% efficacy could prevent 92,000 [61,000–129,000] ETEC and 126,600 [84,000–179,000] Shigella direct deaths and 21,400 [11,300–34,800] ETEC- and 34,200 [18,000–56,000] Shigella-induced stunting deaths. ETEC ICERs ranged from $2172/DALY [1457–4369] in AFRO to $19,172/DALY [12,665–39,503] in EURO. Shigella ICERs ranged from $952/DALY [632–2001] in EMRO to $640,316/DALY [434,311–1,297,192] in EURO. Limitations of this analysis include uncertainty of vaccine efficacy, duration of protection, and vaccine price. Inclusion of other infectious disease mortality due to stunting provides a more accurate assessment of total ETEC and Shigella disease burden and increased the projected impact and cost-effectiveness of vaccination. Introducing vaccines only in high burden countries and regions could substantially reduce cost without substantially reducing impact. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={This study presents land-use regression (LUR) models for submicron particulate matter (PM1) components from an urban area. Models are presented for mass concentrations of inorganic species (SO4, NO3, NH4), organic aerosol (OA) factors, and total PM1. OA is source-apportioned using positive matrix factorization (PMF) of data collected from aerosol mass spectrometry deployed on a mobile laboratory. PMF yielded a three-factor solution: cooking OA (COA), hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), and less-oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA). This study represents the first time that LUR has been applied to source-resolved OA factors. We sampled a roughly 20 km2 area of West Oakland, California, USA, over 1 month (mid-July to mid-August, 2017). The road network of the sampling domain was comprehensively sampled each day using a randomized driving route to minimize temporal and spatial bias. Mobile measurements were aggregated both spatially and temporally for use as discrete spatial observations for LUR model building. LUR model performance was highest for those species with more spatial variability (primary OA factors: COA R2 = 0.80, HOA R2 = 0.67) and lowest for secondary inorganic species (SO4 R2 = 0.47, NH4 R2 = 0.43) that were more spatially homogeneous. Notably, the stepwise selective LUR algorithm largely selected predictors for primary OA factors that correspond to the associated land-use categories (e.g., cooking land-use variables were selected in cooking-related PM models). This finding appears to be robust, as we demonstrate the predictive link between land-use variables and the corresponding source-resolved PM1 components through a subsampling analysis. © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={This research aimed to further our understanding of how environmental processes control micropollutant dynamics in surface water systems as a means to predict peak concentration events and inform intermittent sampling strategies. We characterized micropollutant concentrations in daily composite samples from the Fall Creek Monitoring Station over 18 months. These data were compiled alongside environmental covariates, including daily measurements of weather, hydrology, and water quality parameters, to generate a novel data set with high temporal resolution. We evaluated the temporal trends of several representative micropollutants, along with cumulative metrics of overall micropollutant contamination, by means of multivariable analyses to determine which combination of covariates best predicts micropollutant dynamics and peak events. Peak events of agriculture-derived micropollutants were best predicted by positive associations with turbidity and UV254 absorbance and negative associations with baseflow index. Peak events of wastewater-derived micropollutants were best predicted by positive associations with alkalinity and negative associations with streamflow rate. We demonstrate that these predictors can be used to inform intermittent sampling strategies aimed at capturing peak events, and we generalize the approach so that it could be applied in other watersheds. Finally, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to contextualize micropollutant data derived from infrequent grab samples. © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The generation of tar in biomass gasification is highly undesirable since the condensation and agglomeration of tar causes clogging and contamination of downstream equipment, leading to low energy efficiency and high maintenance cost. Currently, the most widely used methods for tar reforming are catalytic reforming and plasma reforming. However, the main drawbacks for these two processes are: (i) the rapid catalyst deactivation caused by poisoning, sintering and coke deposition for catalytic reforming, and (ii) low energy efficiency, low selectivity of syngas and the formation of undesirable byproducts for plasma reforming. Recently, therefore, the hybrid plasma-catalysis system has attracted much attention for tar reforming, since it can overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks and generate a synergy effect. The addition of catalyst in plasma could change the discharge properties of plasma, and the plasma could also modify the catalyst property and change the status of reactants. At present, very few review articles have reported and compared the performances of tar reforming in the plasma-only, catalysis-only and hybrid plasma-catalysis system. Therefore, this review paper focus on: (i) the deactivation characteristics and modification methods of steam-reforming catalysts, as well as the mechanism of tar catalytic reforming; (ii) the performance of tar reforming in various plasma reactors and the reaction mechanism based on the analysis of byproducts and energetic plasma species; and (iii) the possible synergistic effect of plasma and heterogeneous catalyst in a hybrid plasma-catalysis system caused by the multiple interactions of plasma and catalysts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

First, we propose linear relations between fluctuations in radiative quantities (emission, incident radiation and absorption coefficient) and temperature fluctuations, where the coefficients of proportionality are solely functions of averaged quantities (e.g. emission fluctuations E′ can be related with temperature θ in the following way, E′=fE(θ¯)θ′). The validity of these linear relations is supported by an excellent agreement with DNS for all considered gray gas cases. Using these linear relations it is possible to show that gray gas TRI can be fully characterized without accounting for fluctuations in absorption coefficient. Second, TRI for non-gray gases is investigated and the developed concepts are extended to account for the spectrally varying absorption coefficient. In particular, the derived linear relations are used to show that the influence of a wavelength dependent κ manifests itself in an increase of the “effective” optical thickness of the flow. A new turbulence based spectral averaging is proposed that results in a mean κ, which uniquely characterizes TRI of non-gray participating media. Finally, we apply our models to estimate classical TRI (impact of fluctuations in radiative quantities on the mean radiative source) and a perfect agreement with DNS is observed. We anticipate that the proposed formulations also have the potential to allow for a better characterization in TRI, where strong temperature fluctuations are present, such as in combustion applications. Yet, this needs to be explored in future studies. © 2019},

abstract={Due to the need of better understanding of molecular composition of petroleum fractions to meet stricter environmental legislations, molecular level characterization has been investigated by various researchers and showed promising progress in modern refinery design, simulation and optimization. However, not only there is still an unavoidable trade-off between keeping astronomical molecule details and practicality in industrial applications, but also the developed molecular approaches are mainly applied to reaction kinetic modelling, while modelling of separation is largely based on a different method of pseudo-component representation. This inconsistency could lead to the loss of molecular information when multiple processes with reaction and separation are interconnected. In this work, the pseudo-component representation method is extended to incorporate a modified MTHS (Molecular Type-Homologous Series) matrix method [Peng, B., Molecular modelling of petroleum processes. Ph.D. Thesis, UMIST, 1999] to characterize the molecular information of pseudo-components in light to middle distillate petroleum fractions, in which boiling ranges are combined with molecular types of paraffins, olefins, naphthene, aromatics, and their derivatives to represent the molecular composition in a matrix form. The properties of each matrix entry as a component are estimated based on conventional mixing rules and thermodynamic equilibrium of isomer distribution. The composition of each matrix entry can then be estimated through regression analysis to match the predicted and measured bulk properties, with an underlying assumption that the distribution of each homologous series follows a gamma distribution function. Case studies for naphtha and light gas oil show good agreements in molecular composition and bulk properties between calculated and experimental data. © 2019},

abstract={This paper models the breakage of large aspect ratio particles in an attrition cell using discrete element method (DEM)and population balance (PB)models. The particles are modeled in DEM as sphero-cylinders. The stresses within each particle are calculated along the particle length using beam theory and the particle breaks into two parts if the stress exceeds a critical value. Thus, the size distribution changes with time within the DEM model. The DEM model is validated against previously published experimental data. The simulations demonstrate that particle breakage occurs primarily in front of the attrition cell blades, with the breakage rate decreasing as the particle sizes decrease. Increasing the particle elastic modulus, decreasing the particle yield strength, and increasing the attrition cell lid stress also increase the rate of breakage. Particles break most frequently at their center and the daughter size distribution normalized by the initial particle size is fit well with a Gaussian distribution. Parametric studies in which the initial particle size distribution varies demonstrate that the particle sizes approach a distribution that is independent of the initial state after a sufficient amount of work is done on the particle bed. A correlation for the specific breakage rate is developed from the DEM simulations and used within a PB model along with the daughter size distribution fit. The PB model also clearly shows that the particle size distribution becomes independent of the initial size distribution and after a sufficiently long time, is fit well with a log-normal distribution. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Nanodiamond aggregates have interparticle pores of 4.5 nm on average, exhibiting porous nature involved in their water storage. This work studies the hygroscopic nature of porous nanodiamond aggregates by water absorption based on liquid water droplets. Nanodiamond aggregates show hydrophobicity from the water vapor adsorption. Surprisingly, porous nanodiamond aggregates quickly absorb water droplets at the bulk scale. The volume of absorbed liquid water is comparable to that of the water-absorbing clay Montmorillonite and higher than those of zeolites ZSM-5 and molecular sieve 5A. This hygroscopic nature of nanodiamonds is ascribed to the micro- and mesoporous structure of their aggregates and the special core-shell structure of each nanodiamond particle (wrapped by graphene-like carbon). The absorption rate of liquid water in the porous nanodiamonds is influenced by the surface wettability, while the hygroscopic capacity depends mainly on the hierarchical porosity. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Finding the best purification process is a challenging task. Recently, mechanistic models that can accelerate the development of chromatographic unit operations, the most important purification units, became widely available. In previous work, several chromatographic models have been linked together to simulate and optimize integrated processes. However, considering only chromatographic steps may lead to a suboptimal process. Consequently, the aim of this study was to include models for ultra- and diafiltration units into the optimization approach to account for buffer exchange steps before or between chromatography units. This approach was applied to an industrial case, the purification of a monoclonal antibody, where cation exchange, hydrophobic interaction and mixed mode were the possible chromatographic separation modes. It turned out that only the duration of the total filtration step and the duration of the ultrafiltration step were crucial variables for the optimization of the ultra- and diafiltration steps. The ‘best’ in silico purification process was found based on the performance criteria yield and solvent usage. The purity was required to be at least 99.9%. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Multiphasic fermentations where an organic phase is spontaneously formed or when it is added for product removal are commonly used for production of valuable compounds. The turbulent conditions and the presence of surface-active compounds (SACs) during fermentation create a stable emulsion difficult to separate. A gas bubble/oil droplet separation method has been proposed to break such emulsion. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to describe oil/bubble interaction in a region of high oil droplet concentration. Model validation was performed using a synthetic emulsion and an emulsion from a fermentation broth. By applying the optimal parameters predicted by the model, a 6- and 3-times oil recovery improvement was reached for the synthetic emulsion and the fermentation broth, respectively. In conclusion, the proposed mechanistic model allowed to improve oil recovery in the existing laboratory set-up, and can be used to optimize the separation and recovery method at large scale. © 2019},

abstract={Recently we have introduced a novel methodology for efficient transport of heavy oil via a triple-layer core-annular flow. Pumping pressures are significantly reduced by concentrating high shear rates to a lubricating layer, while ideas from visco-plastic lubrication were used to eliminate the possibility of interfacial instabilities. Specifically, we purposefully position a shaped unyielded skin of a visco-plastic fluid between the transported oil and the lubricating fluid layer. The shaping of the skin layer allows for lubrication forces to develop as the core settles under the action of transverse buoyancy forces: adopting an eccentric position where buoyancy and lubrication forces balance. In later work we have explained how to sculpt the interface in a stable controlled way to achieve a desired shape. Here we show an explicit advantage of the proposed method: namely that we are able to produce stable core-annular flows in regimes where conventional core-annular flows are unsuitable, i.e. either dispersed phases or instability result. Essentially the method can give stable flows for a very wide range of fluid input ratio, although not all will produce the desired reduction in frictional pressure losses. © 2019},

abstract={Single crystalline film (SCF) of Lu3Al5O12 (LuAG) garnet doped with Ce3+ ions grown onto Y3Al5O12 (YAG) substrate has been studied for the first time by Raman spectroscopy. In order to record undisturbed spectra (separated signals) of LuAG:Ce SCF and YAG substrate, the sample was broken and the spectra were measured of particular parts of the cross-section. Due to Ce3+ doping and intense Ce3+ luminescence the Raman spectra had to be measured using the excitation wavelength of 785 nm. The Raman modes recorded for LuAG:Ce SCF and YAG substrate are overlapped with electronic transitions attributed to rare earth (RE) trace impurities of the sample. Moreover, many intense lines were recorded in the spectral range above 900 cm−1 in which the first- and higher-order Raman modes do not occur. The lines above 900 cm−1 were assigned to 4f-4f electronic transitions of RE3+ trace impurities present both in SCF and the substrate. The main identified RE impurity ions were Nd3+, Yb3+, Er3+, and Eu3+. Both the Raman map and the map obtained on the basis of electronic transitions allow distinction between the SCF, substrate, and transition layer of the sample investigated. In the temperature range 80–318 K, a strong increase in the intensities of a few lines assigned to electronic transitions was observed with decreasing temperature. Some anomaly in the temperature dependence of intensity at about 180 K for some lines recorded for SCF and YAG substrate was observed. © 2019},

The obtained results were compared with blends of 2-(diethylamino)ethanol (DEEA) and MAPA. The present study indicated that the blended amines, with varying solvent concentration, obtained comparable values for the overall mass transfer coefficient due to competing effects between solubility, diffusivity and reaction kinetics. The solubility of CO2 was higher in DEEA/MAPA than in the other blended amines, while the calculated values for the pseudo-first order kinetic constant were higher for the 3DMA1P/MAPA and 1-(2HE)PRLD/MAPA solutions than for the DEEA/MAPA solution. The pseudo-first order kinetic constants were correlated to the direct mechanism with reasonable accuracy. The contribution of the tertiary amine as a proton receiver for the MAPA-CO2 reaction represented between 53 and 70% of the pseudo-first order kinetic constant. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) and ammonium (NH4-N) and/or dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) load in drainage water from farms can be managed by reactive or biological media filters. The nutrient content of the drainage water can be obtained directly from water analysis, which immediately focuses attention on filter media selection. There are many factors that may be important before choosing a medium or media e.g. nutrient removal capacity, lifetime, hydraulic conductivity, the potential for “pollution swapping”, attenuation of non-target contaminants (e.g. pesticides, organic carbon, etc.), and local availability and transportation cost of media to site. In this study, a novel decision support tool (DST) was developed, which brought all these factors together in one place for five nutrient scenarios. A systematic literature review was conducted to create a database containing 75 media with an associated static scoring system across seven criteria (% of nutrient concentration reduction, removal of other pollutants, lifetime, hydraulic conductivity, negative externalities) and a dynamic scoring system across two criteria (delivery cost and availability). The DST was tested using case studies from Ireland, Belgium and USA with different agricultural practices and nutrient scenarios. It was then validated by SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunities and threats) analysis. The DST provided a rapid, easily modifiable screening of many media-based treatments for specific dual or single nutrient-based water drainage problems. This provides stakeholders (farmers/regulators/advisors) with a versatile, flexible and robust yet easy-to-understand framework to make informed choices on appropriate media-based mitigation measures according to users’ relevant technical, economic and logistical factors. © 2019},

abstract={The rheology of suspensions of high-inertia (or granular) non-spherical particles characterized by high particle Stokes and Reynolds numbers is rarely investigated. In this study, we investigate the rheology of suspensions of inertial rod-like particles of aspect ratio 4 subjected to shear flow. In particular, the effect of fluid medium (air, water) against dry granular simulations on the developed stresses is assessed. CFD-DEM simulations are performed for a periodic shear box for a range of shear rates and volume fractions of particles. The dependence of rheological properties like shear stress, normal stress difference, pressure and relative viscosity on volume fraction, shear rate, granular temperature and the particle orientation are discussed. These results provide insight into the macroscopic rheology of suspensions of rods and demonstrate that the effect of particle shape and surrounding fluid cannot be completely ignored. Air as a fluid medium shows similar scaling as compared to dry granular simulations, but the stress values are generally lower. We observe drastic change in both scaling and values for water as fluid medium. In all cases, the rods show strong alignment in the direction of shear. This study can be further extended to develop stress closures for use in Eulerian flow models. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={A five parameter cubic equation of state, named 5PGDN is presented for the prediction of thermodynamic properties of pure fluids and mixtures. A new alpha function is proposed with two compound specific parameters which are estimated by matching experimental saturation vapor pressure data at two fixed temperatures Tr=0.5,0.7. We have cast three of the five parameters in terms of the remaining two parameters. The 5PGDN uses the critical temperature, the critical pressure, the critical compressibility factor, and two parameters of the alpha function to calculate thermodynamic properties such as saturated vapor pressure, liquid and vapor density, enthalpy of vaporization, sound velocity, heat capacity at constant pressure and volume. The 5PGDN is further used for the prediction of bubble point pressure and vapor mole fraction of several binary mixtures. The accuracy of 5PGDN is demonstrated by comparing results with the Patel-Teja (PT), Haghtalab-Kamali-Mazloumi-Mahmoodi (HKM1) and Ghoderao-Dalvi-Narayan (4PGDN1) equations of state. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Plant growth responds to various environmental and developmental cues via signaling cascades that influence gene expression at the level of transcription and pre-mRNA splicing. Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA increases the coding potential of the genome from multiexon genes and regulates gene expression through multiple mechanisms. Serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins, a conserved family of splicing factors, are the key players of alternative splicing and regulate pre-mRNA splicing under stress conditions. The rice (Oryza sativa) genome encodes 22 SR proteins categorized into six subfamilies. Three of the subfamilies are plant-specific with no mammalian orthologues, and the functions of these SR proteins are not well known. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system is a genome engineering tool that cleaves the target DNA at specific locations directed by a guide RNA (gRNA). Recent advances in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated plant genome engineering make it possible to generate single and multiple functional knockout mutants in diverse plant species. In this study, we targeted each rice SR locus and produced single knockouts. To overcome the functional redundancy within each subfamily of SR genes, we utilized a polycistronic tRNA-gRNA multiplex targeting system and targeted all loci of each subfamily. Sanger sequencing results indicated that most of the targeted loci had knockout mutations. This study provides useful resource materials for understanding the molecular role of SR proteins in plant development and biotic and abiotic stress responses. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Seeds are the basis of propagation for the common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), but the seed set of the beech is unsteady, with 5–10 years between abundant crops. Beech seeds are very difficult to store and lose their viability quickly even in optimum storage conditions. To date, it has not been possible to determine factors indicative of the aging process and the loss of viability of beech seeds during storage. To address this important economic challenge and interesting scientific problem, we analyzed the adjustment of the redox state during the development and storage of seeds. Many metabolic processes are based on reduction and oxidation reactions. Thiol proteins control and react to the redox state in the cells. The level of thiol proteins increased during seed maturation and decreased during storage. Gel-based redox proteomics identified 17 proteins in beech seeds during development. The proteins could be assigned to processes like metabolism and antioxidant functions. During storage, the number of proteins decreased to only six, i.e., oxidoreductases, peptidases, hydrolases and isomerases. The occurrence of peroxiredoxins (PRX) as thiol peroxidases and redox regulators indicates an important role of cytosolic 1CysPRX and PRXIIC, mitochondrial PRXIIF, and plastidic PRXIIE, 2CysPRX, and PRXQ in beech seeds during development and storage. Particularly, 2CysPRX was present in beech seeds during development and storage and may perform an important function in regulation of the redox state during both seed development and storage. The role of thiol proteins in the regulation of the redox state during the development and storage of beech seeds is discussed. © 2019},

abstract={Artificial wetlands are often constructed to replace degraded natural wetlands; however, it is unclear whether constructed wetlands can become functionally equivalent to natural wetlands. We used measurements of soil and plant nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) storage as indicators of initial function in an artificial wetland in southern California, and compared them to the C and N stocks of local naturally occurring wetlands. We hypothesized that C and N stocks would be significantly lower in the constructed wetland. Soil and vegetation C and N stocks of the constructed wetland increased rapidly but plateaued after 6 years, and soil C and N stocks of the constructed wetland were higher than, or comparable to, local natural wetlands. Limited comparisons between constructed and natural freshwater wetlands reported in the literature illustrated high variability in ecosystem C and N storage, but soil C and N stocks in artificial wetlands were significantly lower than in natural wetlands. Southern California wetlands had lower soil C and N storage compared to other temperate zone wetlands, which may be due to the highly variable rainfall and flow regimes of semi-arid wetlands in southern California. © 2019 The Authors},

The basic characterization studies like XRD and EDS have confirmed amorphous nature and contents of the samples. The spectroscopic studies viz., optical absorption, photoluminescence (PL) and decay profiles were carried out. The PL spectra exhibited an intense sharp green emission peak at 544 nm due to 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ ions both in down-conversion (DC, λexc = 377 nm) and up-conversion (UC, λexc = 977 nm) PL spectra. The spectra also exhibited a broad intense NIR band at 1532 nm ascribed to 4I13/2→4I15/2 transition of Er3+ ions at λexc = 977 nm. The analysis of the spectra indicated 0.5 mol% of Er2O3 is the optimal concentration for achieving maximal PL output both in the green and in NIR regions. The CIE color coordinates and the corresponding CCT (K) values were estimated from both UC and DC emission spectra. Overall analysis of the results suggested that the investigated glasses are potential candidates for getting intense green light emission and are quite suitable as optical fibre amplifiers in the green and NIR (around 1.5 μm) regions. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={In the ONE-FLOW project, the concept of a “Functional Solvent Factory” is proposed, in which designer and conventional solvents are used to transform a multiphase system into a single phase system. This change of phases is alike to the creation and the disruption of compartmented spaces, which will be used for conducting multi-step reactions in a continuous flow. Due to the large availability to a great number of solvents, it is imperative to make a holistic solvent selection. Selection which must be in line with the environmental targets of the pharmaceutical industry. Herein, it is elaborated a methodology to assess common and neoteric solvents for its application in the Functional Solvent Factory. Solubility is taken as the main criterion for the assessment in the Functional Solvent Factory case; however, the solubility of a chemical in a particular solvent is not always known. Therefore, a method to circumvent the lack of solubility data, from an environmental perspective, is proposed. Afterwards, the methodology is applied to assess common solvents. The assessment considered economic and safety constraints. Decan-1-oic acid and 2-octanone were found to be the best solvents for the cascade selected. Thereafter, the environmental assessment showed that Decan-1-oic acid is the best option for the cascade. The aim of this methodology was also to include and compare ionic liquids with conventional solvents, and find the most sustainable option. Applying the methodology to compare an ionic liquid with a conventional solvent was found that the environmental impact of an ionic liquid can be lower to that of a conventional solvent. This is possible when the compound of interest has a higher solubility in the ionic liquid compared with the conventional solvent. © 2019},

abstract={Combining low pressure drop and remarkable heat transport properties, open-cell foams offer a combination that makes them a highly attractive option as monolithic catalyst support. The coupled thermal behavior of foams and fluids during heat production, e.g., exothermic chemical reactions, is still not thoroughly described despite their potential to optimize temperature control in fixed-bed reactors. Hence, the aim of this study is to get deeper insight into coupled conjugate heat transfer and heat production in open-cell foams used in a tubular reactor with constant wall temperature. Therefore, we conducted - μCT-based CFD simulations of open-cell foams with artificial heat sources that mimic the heat of reaction during an exothermal chemical reaction and allow to study the effect of heat production on heat transfer while requiring lower computational cost than simulating actual chemical reactions. We implemented a range of heat source intensities, that covers typical exothermic reactions, to study their effect on heat flows as well as temperature fields and used CO2 methanation as a case study. We further quantified the influence of superficial velocity, heat source intensity, and material on the temperature fields inside the foam and found conduction being the dominant heat transport mechanism. We further evaluated the feasible range of even more simplified pseudo-homogeneous models and found high thermal conductivities and low superficial velocities to be appropriate. In conclusion, the presented approach offers the possibility to study thermal effects regarding catalytic supports and give valuable insight in heat transport mechanisms under relevant process conditions in heterogeneous catalysis (heat sources: 5–150 W for a reaction volume of 1.2 × 10−5 m3, superficial velocities 0–0.51 m s−1, thermal conductivities 5–50 W m−1 K−1). © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The dissolved metal adsorption and association was determined for ten different filter materials recommended and/or implemented in bioretention facilities. Batch adsorption and batch kinetic experiments were performed at lab-scale using both single and multi-metal solutions. Metal strengths and association were determined by sequential extraction analysis. All materials adsorbed metals and 90% of adsorption occurred within 1 h. However, as metal solutions became more complex, adsorption behavior changed. Generally, filter materials classified as sand with a naturally high pH, relatively low organic matter (OM) content and large specific surface area seem to be good choices for removing dissolved metals. Additionally, a chalk additive might improve metal adsorption whereas biochar did not significantly improve metal retention and may be an unwanted (due to degradation over time) extra source of OM. Regardless of filter material, metals primarily adsorbed to the exchangeable form which indicates that metal adsorption might not be permanent, but rather substantially reversible in some cases. More research is needed to assess whether dissolved metals adsorbed in filter materials of bioretention systems pose a delayed threat instead of an immediate threat. Finally, the authors strongly recommend filter materials intended for stormwater bioretention facilities to be tested prior to implementation. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={In northern countries, the climate, and consequently the use of studded tyres and winter traction sanding, causes accumulation of road dust over winter and spring, resulting in high PM10 concentrations during springtime dusting events. To quantify the dust at the road surface, a method—the wet dust sampler (WDS)—was developed allowing repeatable sampling also under wet and snowy conditions. The principle of operation is flushing high-pressurised water over a defined surface area and transferring the dust laden water into a container for further analyses. The WDS has been used for some time and is presented in detail to the international scientific community as reported by Jonsson et al. (2008) and Gustafsson et al. (2019), and in this paper, the latest version is presented together with an evaluation of its performance. To evaluate the WDS, the ejected water amount was measured, as well as water losses in different parts of the sampling system, together with indicative dust measurement using turbidity as a proxy for dust concentration. The results show that the WDS, when accounting for all losses, have a predictable and repeatable water performance, with no impact on performance based on the variety of asphalt surface types included in this study, given undamaged surfaces. The largest loss was found to be water retained on the surface, and the dust measurements imply that this might not have as large impact on the sampled dust as could be expected. A theoretical particle mass balance shows small particle losses, while field measurements show higher losses. Several tests are suggested to validate and improve on the mass balances. Finally, the WDS is found to perform well and is able to contribute to further knowledge regarding road dust implications for air pollution. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Oregano herbs and essential oils are considered of great interest for their medicinal virtues as well as for their culinary properties. The present investigation aims to study the chemical diversity of the essential oils (EO) of a rare Origanum species (O. grosii) endemic to the North-West of Morocco based on a large sample size (68 individual plants from 8 natural populations). Besides, 8 individual plants (genotypes) with defined EO yield and composition have been transplanted in the experimental field to show the impact of changing environmental conditions on their EO characteristics. All EOs samples were analyzed by Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID), Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (13C NMR). The EO yields of O. grosii extracted by hydrodistillation ranged from 1.71% to 2.41% with an average of 2%. The analysis showed that chemical profile of O. grosii from natural accessions is dominated by carvacrol (0.48–85.66%), p-cymene (3.01–77.49%), thymol (0–75.56%) and γ-terpinene (0–28.9%), and to a lesser extent with thymohydroquinone, thymoquinone and carvacryl methyl oxide in some individual plants with remarkable intraspecific and intrapopulation variability. The EO production of the transplanted genotypes was positively affected by the experimental field conditions. In addition, the transplantation induced changes in the chemical composition of their major components (γ-terpinene, p-cymene, carvacrol, thymol and thymoquinone) where we stated mainly an increase of γ-terpinene and carvacrol against a decrease of p-cymene. The present findings exhibit the chemical profile of O. grosii in relation with their geographical origins, besides they provide useful data concerning the impact of the culture on their EO characteristics. © 2019 South African Association of Botanists},

abstract={Combined natural and engineered water and waste water systems (cNES)are nature-based solutions that utilise naturally occurring processes to remove impurities from water and therefore contribute to the ecosystem service of water quality enhancement. We hypothesise that these systems may also have a potential to deliver ecosystem services other than their primary purpose of water purification and we use spatially-explicit modelling tools to determine these benefits. We focused on three different types of cNES: bank filtration (BF), managed aquifer recharge/soil aquifer treatment (MAR/SAT), and constructed wetlands (CW), and combined the ecosystem services cascade, DESSIN and CICES conceptual frameworks with multiple InVEST 3.4.4 models to investigate the spatial distribution of intermediate ecosystem services within the sites as well as in the surrounding landscape. We also determined the role of habitats present within the sites in wider landscape's connectivity to the nearest Natura 2000 areas using the Circuitscape 4.0 model, assessed the public perception of the aesthetic value of two of the cNES technologies, i.e. CW and MAR/SAT, via an online survey, and linked the determined ecosystem services to their likely beneficiaries. Our results indicated that the sites characterised with semi-natural ecosystems had a good potential for ecosystem services provision and that the selected cNES technologies were favourably received by the public as compared to their engineered equivalents. We concluded that determination of ecosystem services potential from nature-based solutions, such as cNES technologies, should be done in consideration of various contextual factors including the type of habitats/ecosystems present within the proposed solutions, the location within the landscape as well as properties and ecosystem services potential of the areas surrounding the sites, all of which can be facilitated by deployment of spatially-explicit ecosystem service models at early stages of the planning process. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Hydrogen sulfide is a toxic and corrosive gas that must be removed from gaseous hydrocarbon streams prior to combustion. This paper describes a gas biodesulfurization process where sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) facilitate sulfide conversion to both sulfur and sulfate. In order to optimize the formation of sulfur, it is crucial to understand the relations between the SOB microbial composition, kinetics of biological and abiotic sulfide oxidation and the effects on the biodesulfurization process efficiency. Hence, a physiologically based kinetic model was developed for four different inocula. The resulting model can be used as a tool to evaluate biodesulfurization process performance. The model relies on a ratio of two key enzymes involved in the sulfide oxidation process, i.e., flavocytochrome c and sulfide-quinone oxidoreductase (FCC and SQR). The model was calibrated by measuring biological sulfide oxidation rates for different inocula obtained from four full-scale biodesulfurization installations fed with gases from various industries. Experimentally obtained biological sulfide oxidation rates showed dissimilarities between the tested biomasses which could be explained by assuming distinctions in the key-enzyme ratios. Hence, we introduce a new model parameter α to whereby α describes the ratio between the relative expression levels of FCC and SQR enzymes. Our experiments show that sulfur production is the highest at low α values. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Poisson's ratio (υ) defines a material's propensity to laterally expand upon compression, or laterally shrink upon tension for non-auxetic materials. This fundamental metric has traditionally, in some fields, been assumed to be a material-independent constant, but it is clear that it varies with composition across glasses, ceramics, metals, and polymers. The intrinsically elastic metric has also been suggested to control a range of properties, even beyond the linear-elastic regime. Notably, metallic glasses show a striking brittle-to-ductile (BTD) transition for υ-values above ~0.32. The BTD transition has also been suggested to be valid for oxide glasses, but, unfortunately, direct prediction of Poisson's ratio from chemical composition remains challenging. With the long-term goal to discover such high-υ oxide glasses, we here revisit whether previously proposed relationships between Poisson's ratio and liquid fragility (m) and atomic packing density (Cg) hold for oxide glasses, since this would enable m and Cg to be used as surrogates for υ. To do so, we have performed an extensive literature review and synthesized new oxide glasses within the zinc borate and aluminoborate families that are found to exhibit high Poisson's ratio values up to ~0.34. We are not able to unequivocally confirm the universality of the Novikov-Sokolov correlation between υ and m and that between υ and Cg for oxide glass-formers, nor for the organic, ionic, chalcogenide, halogenide, or metallic glasses. Despite significant scatter, we do, however, observe an overall increase in υ with increasing m and Cg, but it is clear that additional structural details besides m or Cg are needed to predict and understand the composition dependence of Poisson's ratio. Finally, we also infer from literature data that, in addition to high υ, high Young's modulus is also needed to obtain glasses with high fracture toughness. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Novel flexible thin mm-sized resistance-typed sensor film (MRSF)fabricated using ink-jet printing technology (IPT)was developed in this study to monitor water flow rate in pipelines in real time in situ mode. The mechanism of MRSF is that the mm-sized interdigitated electrodes made by printing silver nanoparticles on an elastic polyimide film bend under different flow rates, leading to variation of the resistance of the sensor at different degrees of curvature. Continuous flow tests showed that MRSF possessed a high accuracy (0.2 m/s)and excellent sensitivity (0.1447/ms−1). A model of sensor resistance and flow velocity was established to unfold the correlation between the fundamentals of fluid mechanics and the mechanic flexibility of sensor materials. An analytical model yielded a high coefficient of determination (R2 &gt; 0.93)for the relationship between the resistance increment of the MRSF and the square of the flow velocity at the velocity range of 0.25–2 m/s. Furthermore, a temperature-correction model was developed to quantify the effect of water temperature on the sensor resistance readings. MRSF exhibited a low temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR, 0.001)at the water temperature range of 20–60 °C. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)simulations using the finite element method were conducted and confirmed both the underlying load assumptions and the deformation characteristics of the sensor film under various flow and material conditions. High-resolution monitoring of water flow rate using MRSF technology was expected to save at least 50% energy consumption for a given unit, especially under flow fluctuation. MRSF possesses a great potential to perform real-time in situ monitoring at high accuracy with ultralow cost, thus enabling the feedback control at high spatiotemporal resolution to reduce the overall energy consumption in water and wastewater systems. © 2019},

abstract={Microplastics (&lt;5 mm) are ubiquitous in the marine environment, occurring in both sediments and surface waters worldwide. However, few studies have documented the presence of microplastics and tire wear particles in coastal rivers. A survey of microplastics and low-density tire wear particles (≥63 μm) in the sediment and surface water of the three major tributaries within the Charleston Harbor estuary was conducted. Intertidal sediment, subtidal sediment, and sea surface microlayer concentrations ranged from 0 to 652 microplastics/m2, 3–4,375 microplastics/kg wet weight, and 3–36 microplastics/L, respectively. Blue fibers and tire wear particles were the two most abundant microplastic types observed, constituting 26.2% and 17.1%, respectively, of total microplastics. Tire wear particles were primarily identified by morphology, and ATR-FTIR analysis was conducted for a small subset (n = 5) of larger particles (≥500 μm). The present study provides the first microplastic field assessment of low-density tire wear particles in estuarine tributaries. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Aquaculture is the fastest growing animal food production industry, now producing 50% of all food fish. However, aquaculture feeds remain dependent on fishmeal derived from capture fisheries, which must be reduced for continued sustainable growth. Purple phototrophic bacteria (PPB) efficiently yield biomass from wastewater with high product homogeneity, a relatively high protein fraction, and potential added value as an ingredient for fish feeds. Here we test bulk replacement of fishmeal with PPB microbial biomass in diets for Asian sea bass (Lates calcarifer), a high value carnivorous fish with high protein to energy requirement. Mixed culture PPB were grown in a novel 1 m3 attached photo-biofilm process using synthetic and real wastewater. Four experimental diets were formulated to commercial specifications but with the fishmeal substituted (0%, 33%, 66%, and 100%) with the synthetic grown PPB biomass and fed to a cohort of 540 juvenile fish divided amongst 12 tanks over 47 days. Weight and standard length were taken from individual fish at 18, 28, and 47d. No significant difference in survival was observed due to diet or other factors (94–100%). There was a negative correlation between PPB inclusion level and final weight (p = 5.94 × 10−5) with diet accounting for 4.1% of the variance over the trial (general linear model, R2 = 0.96, p = 1 × 10−6). Feed conversion ratio was also significantly influenced by diet (p = 6 × 10−7) with this factor accounting for 89% of variance. Specifically, feed conversion ratio (FCR) rose to 1.5 for the 100% replacement diet during the last sample period, approximately 1.0 for the partial replacement, and 0.8 for the nil replacement diet. However, this study demonstrates that bulk replacement of fishmeal by PPB is feasible, and commercially viable at 33% and 66% replacement. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Basic understanding of formation of aerobic granular sludge (AGS) has mainly been derived from lab-scale systems with simple influents containing only highly diffusible volatile fatty acids (VFA) as organic substrate. This study compares start-up of AGS systems fed by different synthetic and municipal wastewaters (WW), characterised by increasing complexity in terms of non-diffusible organic substrate. Four AGS reactors were started with the same inoculum activated sludge and operated for one year. The development of AGS, settling characteristics, nutrient and substrate removal performance as well as microbial community composition were monitored. Our results indicate that the higher the content of diffusible organic substrate in the WW, the faster the formation of AGS. The presence of non-diffusible organic substrate in the influent WW led to the formation of small granules and to the presence of 20–40% (% of total suspended solids) of flocs in the AGS. When AGS was fed with complex influent WW, the classical phosphorus and glycogen accumulating organisms (PAO, GAO) were outcompeted by their fermentative equivalents. Substrate and nutrient removal was observed in all reactors, despite the difference in physical and settling properties of the AGS, but the levels of P and N removal depended on the influent carbon composition. Mechanistically, our results indicate that increased levels of non-diffusible organic substrate in the influent lower the potential for microbial growth deep inside the granules. Additionally, non-diffusible organic substrates give a competitive advantage to the main opponents of AGS formation – ordinary heterotrophic organisms (OHO). Both of these mechanisms are suspected to limit AGS formation. The presented study has relevant implications for both practice and research. Start-up duration of AGS systems treating high complexity WW were one order of magnitude higher than a typical lab-scale system treating VFA-rich synthetic WW, and biomass as flocs persisted as a significant fraction. Finally, the complex synthetic influent WW – composed of VFA, soluble fermentable and particulate substrate - tested here seems to be a more adequate surrogate of real municipal WW for laboratory studies than 100%-VFA WW. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Nuclear receptors comprise a class of intracellular transcription factors whose major role is to act as sensors of various stimuli and to convert the external signal into a transcriptional output. Nuclear receptors (NRs) achieve this by possessing a ligand binding domain, which can bind cell permeable agonists, a DNA-binding domain, which binds the upstream sequences of target genes, and a regulatory domain that recruits the transcriptional machinery. The ligand binding alters the activation state of the NR, either by activating or inactivating its transcriptional output. Given the central role of NRs in signal transduction, many currently approved therapeutics modulate the activity of NRs. Here we discuss how PROTAC degraders afford a novel approach to abrogate the downstream signaling activity of NRs. We highlight six broad functional reasons why PROTAC degraders are preferable to the classical ligand binding pocket antagonists, with specific examples provided for each category. Lastly, as Androgen Receptor and Estrogen Receptor PROTAC degraders are being pursued as treatment for prostate cancer and breast cancer, respectively, a rationale is provided for the translational utility for the degradation of these two NRs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Humans unsustainably scavenge massive amounts of nutrients from the environment to feed our agricultural systems, thereby perturbing pre-existing natural re-cycling processes. Only a minor fraction of the nutrients are eventually taken up by crops and converted into food, while the majority runs-off into the environment, causing the release of greenhouse gases (e.g. emission of nitrous and nitrogen oxides from the soil) and threatening water security/biodiversity in several ecosystems. The estimated continued growth in global population in the 21st century is expected to place even greater pressure on nutrient use, with likely consequences for the sustainability of human society. Technologies that are able to balance the requirement for intensification of food production with a mitigation of its impact on the environment will be essential to deploy in the near future. The aim is to substantially increase nutrient use-efficiency in order to lower the pressure on finite resources and lighten the environmental impact of intensive agriculture. In this review, we will discuss one such technology, sunlight-driven prokaryotic and eukaryotic microalgae, as a vehicle for both capture and provision of nutrients leached from and provided to agricultural systems, respectively. This technology has the potential to make a difference, but it remains immature and we need to rapidly enhance our knowledge of its opportunities and challenges in order to exploit it for a sustainable circular nutrient economy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Eutrophication and the resulting formation of harmful algal blooms (HAB) causes huge economic and environmental damages. Phosphorus (P) from sewage effluent and agricultural run-off has been identified as a major cause for eutrophication. Phosphorous concentrations greater than 100 μg P/L are usually considered high enough to cause eutrophication. The strictest regulations however aim to restrict the concentration below 10 μg P/L. Orthophosphate (or phosphate) is the bioavailable form of phosphorus. Adsorption is often suggested as technology to reduce phosphate to concentrations less than 100 and even 10 μg P/L with the advantages of a low-footprint, minimal waste generation and the option to recover the phosphate. Although many studies report on phosphate adsorption, there is insufficient information regarding parameters that are necessary to evaluate its application on a large scale. This review discusses the main parameters that affect the economics of phosphate adsorption and highlights the research gaps. A scenario and sensitivity analysis shows the importance of adsorbent regeneration and reuse. The cost of phosphate adsorption using reusable porous metal oxide is in the range of $ 100 to 200/Kg P for reducing the phosphate to ultra-low concentrations.

abstract={In the last decade, ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) has reemerged as an analytical separation technique, especially due to the commercialization of ion mobility mass spectrometers. Its applicability has been extended beyond classical applications such as the determination of chemical warfare agents and nowadays it is widely used for the characterization of biomolecules (e.g., proteins, glycans, lipids, etc.) and, more recently, of small molecules (e.g., metabolites, xenobiotics, etc.). Following this trend, the interest in this technique is growing among researchers from different fields including food science. Several advantages are attributed to IMS when integrated in traditional liquid chromatography (LC) and gas chromatography (GC) mass spectrometry (MS) workflows: (1) it improves method selectivity by providing an additional separation dimension that allows the separation of isobaric and isomeric compounds; (2) it increases method sensitivity by isolating the compounds of interest from background noise; (3) and it provides complementary information to mass spectra and retention time, the so-called collision cross section (CCS), so compounds can be identified with more confidence, either in targeted or non-targeted approaches. In this context, the number of applications focused on food analysis has increased exponentially in the last few years. This review provides an overview of the current status of IMS technology and its applicability in different areas of food analysis (i.e., food composition, process control, authentication, adulteration and safety). © 2019 by the authors},

abstract={Although zein is a natural protein derived from corn, it has attracted much interest in pharmaceutical and biomedical sciences. Recent remarkable investigations on the use of zein in controlled drug delivery have contributed both important knowledge and potential applications of various products, particularly in the delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs. Zein has also been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for oral delivery. Substantial research has been performed to demonstrate the roles and promise of materials containing zein for pharmaceutical applications. Significant efforts have focused on the biodegradable and hydrophobic properties of zein and on technology using zein as a nanocarrier specifically for nanomedicine. However, important issues concerning the use of zein in technical advances and in the development of poorly water-soluble drugs must be addressed in order to use zein in translational research. This review aims to focus on the classification of potential approaches for using zein in the controlled release of poorly water-soluble drugs and to discuss recommended techniques for creating high-quality products from zein. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

We thoroughly explore the lattice dynamics of the system, and describe a vibrational localized-to-extended transition and discuss the special role of P dynamics. At low energies P is fully contributing to extended modes, but at higher frequencies executes local motion reminiscent of a 'rattler' inside a cage of metal atoms.

abstract={Background: Linking data on laboratory specimens collected during clinical practice with health administrative data permits highly powered vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies to be conducted at relatively low cost, but bias from using convenience samples is a concern. We evaluated the validity of using such data for estimating VE. Methods: We created the Flu and Other Respiratory Viruses Research (FOREVER) Cohort by linking individual-level data on respiratory virus laboratory tests, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and physician services. For community-dwelling adults aged > 65 years, we assessed the presence and magnitude of information and selection biases, generated VE estimates under various conditions, and compared our VE estimates with those from other studies. Results: We included 65,648 unique testing episodes obtained from 54,434 individuals during the 2010–11 to 2015–16 influenza seasons. To examine information bias, we found the proportion testing positive for influenza for patients with unknown interval from illness onset to specimen collection was more similar to patients for whom illness onset date was ≤ 7 days before specimen collection than to patients for whom illness onset was > 7 days before specimen collection. To assess the presence of selection bias, we found the likelihood of influenza testing was comparable between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, although the adjusted odds ratios were significantly greater than 1 for some healthcare settings and during some influenza seasons. Over 6 seasons, VE estimates ranged between 36% (95%CI, 27–44%) in 2010–11 and 5% (95%CI, –2, 11%) in 2014–15. VE estimates were similar under a range of conditions, but were consistently higher when accounting for misclassification of vaccination status through a quantitative sensitivity analysis. VE estimates from the FOREVER Cohort were comparable to those from other studies. Conclusions: Routinely collected laboratory and health administrative data contained in the FOREVER Cohort can be used to estimate influenza VE in community-dwelling older adults. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Capacitive deionization (CDI) is an emerging water treatment technology often applied to brackish water desalination and water softening. Typical CDI cells consist of two microporous carbon electrodes sandwiching a dielectric separator, and desalt feedwater flowing through the cell by storing ions in electric double layers (EDLs) within charged micropores. CDI cells have demonstrated size-based ion selectivity wherein smaller hydrated ions are preferentially electrosorbed over larger hydrated ions. We demonstrate that such size-based selectivity can be substantially enhanced through the addition of chemical charge to micropores via surface functionalization. We develop a micropore EDL theory that includes both finite ion size effects and micropore chemical charge, which predicts such enhancements and elucidates that they result from denser counterion packing in micropores. With our experimental CDI cell, we desalted an electrolyte consisting of equimolar potassium (K+) and lithium (Li+) ions. We show that use of a surface-functionalized (oxidized) cathode significantly increased the electrosorption ratio of smaller K+ to larger Li+ compared to a cell with a pristine cathode, for example, from ?1 to 1.84 for a charging voltage of 0.4 V. Our model predicts yet-higher electrosorption ratios are attainable, but our experimental cell suffered from significant cathode chemical charge degradation at applied voltages of ?1 V. © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Tumor metastasis is a major contributor to the death of cancer patients. It is driven not only by the intrinsic alterations in tumor cells, but also by the implicated cross-talk between cancer cells and their altered microenvironment components. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the key cells that create an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) by producing cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and triggering the inhibitory immune checkpoint proteins release in T cells. In doing so, TAMs exhibit important functions in facilitating a metastatic cascade of cancer cells and, meanwhile, provide multiple targets of certain checkpoint blockade immunotherapies for opposing tumor progression. In this article, we summarize the regulating networks of TAM polarization and the mechanisms underlying TAM-facilitated metastasis. Based on the overview of current experimental evidence dissecting the critical roles of TAMs in tumor metastasis, we discuss and prospect the potential applications of TAM-focused therapeutic strategies in clinical cancer treatment at present and in the future. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={The mixed alkali effect, the deviation from expected linear property changes when alkali ions are mixed in a glass, remains a point of contention in the glass community. While several earlier models have been proposed to explain mixed alkali effects on ionic motion, models based on or containing discussion of structural aspects of mixed-alkali glasses remain rare by comparison. However, the transition-range viscosity depression effect is many orders in magnitude for mixed-alkali glasses, and the original observation of the effect (then known as the Thermometer Effect) concerned the highly anomalous temperature dependence of stress and structural relaxation time constants. With this in mind, a new structural model based on topological constraint theory is proposed herein which elucidates the origin of the mixed alkali effect as a consequence of network strain due to differing cation radii. Discussion of literature models and data alongside new molecular dynamics simulations and experimental data are presented in support of the model, with good agreement.

abstract={Topological constraint theory (TCT) classifies disordered networks as flexible, stressed-rigid, or isostatic based on the balance between the number of topological constraints and degrees of freedom. In contrast with the predictions from a mean-field enumeration of the constraints, the isostatic state—wherein the network is rigid but free of stress—has been suggested to be achieved within a range of compositions, the intermediate phase, rather than at a fixed threshold. However, our understanding of the nature and potential structural signatures of the intermediate phase remains elusive. Here, based on molecular dynamics simulations of calcium–silicate–hydrate systems with varying compositions, we seek for some mechanical and structural signatures of the intermediate phase. We show that this system exhibits a composition-driven rigidity transition. We find that the fracture toughness, fracture energy, mechanical reversibility, and creep compliance exhibit an anomalous behavior within a compositional window at the vicinity of the isostatic threshold. These features are argued to constitute a mechanical signature of an intermediate phase. Notably, we identify a clear structural signature of the intermediate phase in the medium-range order of this system, which is indicative of an optimal space-filling tendency. Based on these simulations, we demonstrate that the intermediate phase observed in this system arises from a bifurcation between the rigidity and stress transitions. These features might be revealed to be generic to isostatic disordered networks. © 2019 Zhou, Wang, Guo, Boolchand and Bauchy.},

abstract={Aneurysms involving the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) have a greater incidence of fusiform morphology, intraluminal thrombi, and wall calcifications. At times, a complex treatment strategy with vessel occlusion and revascularization using a bypass graft is necessary for successful obliteration of these aneurysms. The occipital artery (OA) is often the preferred donor graft for lesions of the posterior fossa because of its proximity to the target recipient vessels. However, dissection of an OA can be challenging, given its anatomically tortuous path and the presence of thick surrounding muscles. This video captures the dissection of the OA using an unconventional, “inside-out” harvesting technique and the end-to-side anastomosis of the OA to the PICA at the p3 segment. This was performed in a 58-year-old man who presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (Hunt and Hess grade IV) from a ruptured fusiform aneurysm located at the origin of the right PICA. Major steps in Video 1 during this case include 1) dissection and harvesting of the OA using the “inside out” technique, 2) placement of 2 temporary clips occluding the PICA and isolating the P3 segment, 3) end-to-side OA-P3 anastomosis, and 4) removal of the temporary clips and confirmation of the PICA's patency using intraoperative indocyanine green. Due to the potential for infarction of the brainstem, the patient was started on dual antiplatelet therapy postoperatively. The patient tolerated the procedure well and suffered no major complications related to the operation or from being placed on dual antiplatelet therapy. He did experience some mild, posterior neck pain and rigidity at the time of his 3-month follow-up, likely due to nerve injury that occurred while harvesting the OA. Overall, the patient remains in good neurologic status 1 year after the operation. Complex fusiform aneurysms at the origin of PICA can be successfully treated via an OA-PICA bypass. © 2019},

abstract={The effective prediction of pavement performance trends can help in achieving the cost-effective management of pavements over their service life. The international roughness index (IRI) is a widely used pavement performance index, which can be considered as a time-dependent variable in terms of scientific modeling. This research aims to develop an innovative IRI prediction model based on fuzzy-trend time-series forecasting and particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques. Raw datasets extracted from the Long-Term Pavement Performance database are used for model training, testing, and performance assessment. First, IRI values are divided into different granular spaces, which are considered as the principal factor and subfactors. In addition, the multifactor interval division method is proposed according to the principle of the automatic clustering technique. Next, a second-order fuzzy-trend model and fuzzy-trend relationship classification method are proposed to predict the fuzzy-trend of each factor. Then, the fuzzy-trend states for multiple granular spaces are generated while giving full consideration to various uncertainties. Finally, the PSO technique is used to optimize the performance model while carrying out future IRI forecasting. Comparative experiments are performed using more than 20,000 data items from different regions to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms other approaches including the polynomial fitting, autoregressive integrated moving average, and backpropagation neural network methods in terms of the root mean squared error (0.191) and relative error (6.37%). © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Air quality over cities is mainly monitored by in-situ surface measurements. However, these stations are too sparse to properly capture the inhomogeneity of pollutant concentrations over urban areas. The need for high-resolution concentration estimate has grown in recent years, together with the awareness of the harmful effects of air pollution. In this study, we develop a Bayesian scheme that combines the high-resolution (3 × 3 m2) Particulate Micro SWIFT SPRAY numerical air quality simulations (PMSS) with operational surface measurements. The goal is to improve NOX and PM10 PMSS concentrations estimates over monitoring stations and within their vicinity. For this purpose, we simulate pollutant concentrations over the city of Paris for ten days over the period of March 2016. The Bayesian model provides an enhanced estimate of pollutant concentration in space and time. At the monitoring stations location, these estimates are characterized by lower temporal dispersion compared to the simulated data. Within the vicinity of the monitor stations, enhanced concentration estimates are closer to observations. For NOX, the improvement is stronger and occurs in a larger area for urban background stations than for traffic stations. Overall, NOX improvement is higher than PM10 improvement. The initial PMSS model prediction is more biased for NOX than for PM10 due to large uncertainties in NOX emissions over the traffic network. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={To address water scarcity in semi-arid regions, rainfall and runoff need to be captured and stored locally before they are lost to the sea. This can be done using a sand dam which consists of a reinforced wall constructed during the dry season across a seasonal riverbed. However it is unclear whether their main utility is to store water in the sand that is also trapped behind them, or to facilitate aquifer recharge. This paper aims to answer this question by the calculation of a water balance in three sand dams in Kenya to quantify the amount of water transferred between the sand dam and the surrounding aquifer system. The components of the water balance were derived from extensive field monitoring. Water level monitoring in piezometers installed along the length of the sand deposits enabled calculation of the hydraulic gradient and hence the lateral flow between the different reaches of the sand dam. In one sand dam water was gained consistently through the dry season, in one it was lost, and in the third it was lost almost all the time except for the early dry season in the upper part of the trapped sand. In conclusion sand dams should not be treated as isolated water storage structures. © 2019},

abstract={Validated analytical measurement protocols for the fast and accurate determination of the uranium (U)isotopic composition (234U, 235U, 236U, 238U)of solid nuclear materials were developed employing ns-laser ablation (LA)coupled to multi-collector ICP-MS. The accuracy of the analytical procedure was assured by frequent (n = 65)analysis of a pressed pellet of certified isotopic reference material CRM U-030 (∼3 wt% 235U). The expanded uncertainty (k = 2)for the n(235U)/n(238U)ratio was as low as 0.05%, rising to 0.62% and 1.09% for n(234U)/n(238U)and n(236U)/n(238U)ratios, respectively. LA-MC-ICP-MS measurements of a pressed pellet of certified isotopic reference material CRM U-020 (∼2 wt% 235U)before analysis of each sample allowed calculation of the ion counter gains and mass bias correction. Both individual spot analysis and line scan analysis were used to measure n(234U)/n(238U), n(235U)/n(238U), and n(236U)/n(238U)ratios in two low-enriched UO2 pellets from the fourth Collaborative Materials Exercise (CMX-4), four seized low-enriched UO2 pellets intercepted from illicit trafficking and one metal sample consisting of depleted U. LA-MC-ICP-MS results of all investigated samples matched well with U isotope ratios obtained by thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS). This independent confirmation of the LA-MC-ICP-MS results by TIMS underpinned the high quality of generated analytical data. Acquisition of several thousand data points within a couple of minutes during line scan analysis yielded detailed information on the spatial distribution of the U isotopic composition of selected UO2 pellets, revealing straightforwardly their (in˗)homogeneity on the μm-scale. Calculating skewness and half width of the frequency distributions of the n(235U)/n(238U)amount ratio allowed the quantitative assessment of the (in-)homogeneity of the investigated samples. This information allows drawing conclusions on the starting materials used for the production of the pellets. From a nuclear forensics perspective, LA-MC-ICP-MS provides quick, accurate results on the spatial distribution of major and minor U isotopes while preserving the sample i.e. piece of evidence, essentially intact. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Previous laboratory investigations have predominantly relied on UV absorption measurement of [HNO3]. Whilst direct, this measurement is difficult at temperatures &lt;298 K, where heterogeneous loss to cold surfaces is significant. Single and two photon photodissociation of HNO3 was studied in N2 and He at 193 and 248 nm, and a unique HNO3 detection method was established using two photons at 248 nm, with good reproducibility and limit of detection (∼1.25 × 1014 cm−3). Emissions from excited products have been identified spectroscopically, over a range of pressures and laser energies to support the HNO3 quantification method. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Using environmental tracers to date groundwater age in fractured systems is difficult since mass exchange processes between fractures and matrix might mask the actual distribution of groundwater velocity, thus leading to biased results. Here, we propose an analytical solution to date groundwater age in fractured media using 4He data. The solution, which is an extension of existing solutions based on linear accumulation methods, decouples the transport equation in the flowing fracture from the diffusion equation in the rock matrix, under the assumption of steady-state conditions. In the proposed analytical solution groundwater age and 4He concentration are linearly related, and the 4He bulk production rate in matrix, scaled by the inverse of fracture volume fraction, is the proportionality constant. This scaling factor accounts for the underlying mass exchange processes between fracture and rock matrix. Moreover, an Equivalent Continuous Porous Medium (ECPM)-based formulation for the numerical assessment of steady-state 4He levels in fractured media is presented and used to test the performance of the proposed dating technique in realistic conditions. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Background: Irritation of the sinuvertebral nerve by a posterior or posterolateral disk desiccation can cause somatic referred pain that can mimic a lumbar radiculopathy. We present a case of a patient presenting with this condition and the positive result in pain improvement after endoscopic radiofrequency ablation of the sinuvertebral nerve. Case Description: An 18-year-old Olympic runner presented to our clinic with back pain and left leg pain in a clear L5 distribution. He did not have a history of trauma. His imaging did not demonstrate any lesion causing compression of the left L5 nerve root as expected. He was found to have a left healing L5 pedicle fracture and ipsilateral chronic L5 pars interarticularis fracture. He was also found to have an ipsilateral minor left L5-S1 disk desiccation. His visual analog scale (VAS) score was 7. After a positive provocative diskogram, the patient underwent percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic radiofrequency ablation of the left L5 sinuvertebral nerve, which was irritated by the left L5-S1 disk desiccation. At his 6-month follow-up visit, the patient's VAS score was 1. Conclusions: It is important for clinicians to remember that back-associated leg pain can be caused by somatic referred pain because of irritation of the sinuvertebral nerve. Endoscopic radiofrequency of this nerve can be beneficial in pain control, but further randomized prospective trials are needed to study these techniques further. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Background: Primary intraosseous hemangioma (PIH) of the skull base, when localized in the sella, is a rare, benign lesion that can mimic other common sellar tumors. Such tumors may be asymptomatic incidental radiologic findings or present with nonspecific symptoms (e.g., headaches). Case Description::We present a case of a primary intraosseous hemangioma of the body of sphenoid bone extending into the sellar cavity, clinicoradiographically mimicking an atypical pituitary adenoma. Conclusions: PIH should be included as a rare differential diagnosis in cases of space-occupying sellar lesions with atypical features. Radiologic and intraoperative findings may be suited to entertain a probable diagnosis; however, a definite diagnosis can only be obtained via histopathologic analysis. Surgical excision may be chosen under the assumption of dealing with a primary pituitary lesion, but extent of resection depends on the accessibility, extent, involvement of surrounding structures (such as the internal carotid artery/cavernous sinus), and control of intraoperative bleeding. When facing inoperable or residual lesions, radiotherapy can be a viable option. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={To provide better access to thermochronological data and understand the long-term denudation history of the Japanese Islands, we compiled a low-temperature thermochronological dataset of fission-track (FT) and (U–Th–Sm)/He (He) ages for apatite and zircon in bedrocks. These thermochronometric ages are compiled from 90 literature sources and 1,096 localities, and include 418 apatite FT ages, 851 zircon FT ages, 42 apatite He ages, and 30 zircon He ages. Many FT ages have been reported previously; however, the number of He ages is limited in the Japanese Islands. The compiled data are spatially biased; for instance, more data are reported for the Chubu and Kinki districts and the Pacific coast of the Shikoku Island, whereas less data were available for the Tohoku and Chugoku districts. For better understanding arc-scale uplift-denudation history, further thermochronological research in the lesser-studied regions and more He thermochronometric measurements are desired.

abstract={The optimal allocation and utilization of irrigation water are particularly significant but complex in multi-stage pumping-water irrigation systems which involve both water distribution processes and machine operation management. This paper proposes a regional optimization-coordination model for optimizing irrigation water allocation in complex multi-stage pumping-water irrigation system, which is developed according to actual water use problems in Guhai pumping-water irrigation system (GPIS) located in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, northwest China. The model is a three-level hieratical structure with minimum water deficiency and energy cost as two objectives for better describing the coordination and constraint between multiple levels of irrigation planning and decision making. The three levels deal with the optimal schemes of pumping and allocating water in each single pumping-irrigation subdistrict (PIS) (first level), among multi-stage pumping-irrigation subdistrict of each subsystem (second level) and among different subsystems (third level) respectively. The model is solved by using decomposition-coordination method and each level is connected and iterated through the exchange of coordinating variables. The model is applied and tested in the optimizations of pumping and allocating water for each PIS in each period in GPIS. Results show that the range of water deficiency among different PIS is significantly reduced and pumping-water amount for the lower-stage PIS is particularly increased under different conditions of total water delivery amount. Spatial-temporal contradictions of water supply among multi-stage pumping stations could be effectively alleviated through optimizations. The application indicates that the optimization-coordination model is practical and effective for decision-making of irrigation water management in the complex multi-stage pumping-water irrigation system, and could be a reference for other similar irrigation systems worldwide. © 2019},

abstract={Numerical integration of the stiffness matrix in higher-order finite element (FE) methods is recognized as one of the heaviest computational tasks in an FE solver. The problem becomes even more relevant when computing the Gram matrix in the algorithm of the Discontinuous Petrov Galerkin (DPG) FE methodology. Making use of 3D tensor-product shape functions, and the concept of sum factorization, known from standard high-order FE and spectral methods, here we take advantage of this idea for the entire exact sequence of FE spaces defined on the hexahedron. The key piece to the presented algorithms is the exact sequence for the one-dimensional element, and use of hierarchical shape functions. Consistent with existing results, the presented algorithms for the integration of H1, H(curl), H(div), and L2 inner products, have the O(p7) computational complexity in contrast to the O(p9) cost of conventional integration routines. Use of Legendre polynomials for shape functions is critical in this implementation. Three boundary value problems under different variational formulations, requiring combinations of H1 H(div) and H(curl) test shape functions, were chosen to experimentally assess the computation time for constructing DPG element matrices, showing good correspondence with the expected rates. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2019.},

abstract={Local fronts, such as sea-breeze and land-breeze fronts, play an important role not only from a meteorological aspect but also for pollutant transport and mixing, in urban areas in particular. Due to the difficulty of measuring three-dimensional (3-D) wind fields, there are few studies focusing on short-term fine-scale spatial and temporal variations in aerosol and gas compositions associated with local front passage. At the end of November 2016, a 3-D coherent Doppler lidar was installed in Fukuoka city (33.55°N, 130.37°E), an urban area in Japan, and 3D-wind fields have been continuously measured since then. Two local fronts with typical density current structure were observed on 3 May and 29 June 2017. On 3 May 2017, there was a stepwise increase in concentrations of aerosol (particularly smaller size aerosol), black carbon (BC) and carbon monoxide (CO), supposedly of surface origin, at the passage of the local front. However, O3 content, which can be higher at higher altitudes, decreased. In another case on 29 June 2017, there was light rain in the early morning and all gas and aerosol contents were low before the passage of the front. At the front passage, there was a stepwise increase in aerosol, BC and CO contents as on 3 May, although O3 content gradually increased after sunrise and no clear change was observed in O3. Vertical aerosol observations by the Doppler lidar indicate that the depth of the front system on 29 June was much thinner (up to 300–400 m) than that on 3 May (up to ∼700 m), and the temperature decrease was larger than on 3 May. These facts suggest that the mixing of air masses within the system with those above or ahead of the system on 29 June was no stronger than on 3 May, and thus the aerosol and gas contents at the ground may be strongly affected by the vertical mixing/dilution of the system as well as by local emission. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The Transition State dividing surface is a key concept, not only for the precise calculation of the rate constant of a reaction, but also for the proper prediction of product ratios. The correct location of this surface is defined by the requirement that reactive trajectories do not recross it. In the case of reactions in solution the solvent plays an important role in the location of the dividing surface. In this paper we show with the aid of a model Hamiltonian that the effective mass of the solvent can dramatically change the location of the dividing surface. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={A previously published radical graft-functionalization method for the synthesis of high performance anion exchangers was further investigated to control the capacity and selectivity of the exchangers. Using a hydrophobic radical initiator instead of a hydrophilic one diminished the influence of rivaling homopolymerization of monomer during the functionalization step. Instead of only generating monomer radicals in free solution the radicals are ideally generated on top of the PS/DVB surface. However, in both cases the selectivity factors of polarizable anions bromide and nitrate in relation to chloride increased strongly with increasing capacity of the exchanger. Higher exchanger capacities could lead to coelution of bromide and/or nitrate with other analytes such as sulfate or phosphate when using the eluent as proposed in this work. By variation of the organic solvent used for functionalization it was possible to remove both the rivaling homopolymerization and the strong influence of the capacity on the selectivity. With increasing solubility of the hydrophobic radical initiator in the organic solvent the influence of the homopolymerization and the influence on the selectivity factor of bromide and nitrate decreased. Additionally, a change of bromate selectivity factor could be observed. The bromate signal is shifted closer towards the chloride signal. However, with increasing solubility of the radical initiator in the organic solvent the observed capacity of the exchangers decreases linearly, resulting in higher amounts of monomer needed for functionalization. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Chromatographic characterization and parameterization studies targeting many solutes require the judicious choice of operating conditions to minimize analysis time without compromising the accuracy of the results. To minimize analysis time, solutes are often grouped into a small number of mixtures; however, this increases the risk of peak overlap. While multivariate curve resolution methods are often able to resolve analyte signals based on their spectral qualities, these methods require that the chromatographically overlapped compounds have dissimilar spectra. In this work, a strategy for grouping compounds into sample mixtures containing solutes with distinct spectral and, optionally, with distinct chromatographic properties, in order to ensure successful solute resolution either chromatographically or with curve resolution methods is proposed. We name this strategy rational design of mixtures (RDM). RDM utilizes multivariate selectivity as a metric for making decisions regarding group membership (i.e., whether to add a particular solute to a particular sample). A group of 97 solutes was used to demonstrate this strategy. Utilizing both estimated chromatographic properties and measured spectra to group these 97 analytes, only 12 groups were required to avoid a situation where two or more solutes in the same group could not be resolved either chromatographically (i.e., they have significantly different retention times) or spectrally (i.e., spectra are different enough to enable resolution by curve resolution methods). When only spectral properties were utilized (i.e., the chromatographic properties are unknown ahead of time) the number of groups required to avoid unresolvable overlaps increased to 20. The grouping strategy developed here will improve the time and instrument efficiency of studies that aim to obtain retention data for solutes as a function of operating conditions, whether for method development or determination of the chromatographic parameters of solutes of interest (e.g., k w ). © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Background: Deep brain stimulation of the motor thalamus or the posterior subthalamic area (PSA) shows promising results for patients with voice tremor, although only for about 50% of patients. There are indications that voice tremor requires more focused stimulation within the target area compared with hand tremor. The objective of the present study was to determine the most efficient location for reducing voice tremor within the PSA. Methods: Thirty-seven patients with essential tremor were evaluated off stimulation and in a set of experimental conditions with unilateral stimulation at increasing amplitude levels. Two listeners performed blinded assessments of voice tremor from recordings of sustained vowel productions. Results: Twenty-five patients (68%) had voice tremor. Unilateral stimulation reduced voice tremor for the majority of patients, and only 6 patients had poor outcomes. Contacts yielding efficient voice tremor reduction were deeper relative to the midcommissural point (MCP) and more posterior relative to the posterior tip of the subthalamic nucleus (pSTN) (z MCP = –3.1, y pSTN = –0.2) compared with poor contacts (z MCP = –0.7, y pSTN = 1.0). High-amplitude stimulation worsened voice tremor for 7 patients and induced voice tremor in 2 patients. Hand tremor improved to a greater extent than voice tremor, and improvements could be seen throughout the target area. Conclusions: Our results indicate that efficient voice tremor reduction can be achieved by stimulating contacts located in the inferior part of the PSA, close or slightly posterior to the pSTN. We observed cases in which voice tremor was induced by high-amplitude stimulation. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Modern anthropogenic activities have significantly increased nitrate (NO3 −) concentrations in surface waters. Stable isotopes (δ15N and δ18O) in NO3 − offer a tool to deconvolute some of the human-made changes in the nitrogen cycle. They are often graphically illustrated on a template designed to identify different sources of NO3 − and denitrification. In the two decades since this template was developed, δ15N- and δ18O-NO3 − have been measured in a variety of ecosystems and through the nitrogen cycle. However, its interpretation is often fuzzy or complex. This default is no longer helpful because it does not describe surface water ecosystems well and biases researchers towards denitrification as the NO3 − removal pathway, even in well oxygenated systems where denitrification is likely to have little to no influence on the nitrogen cycle. We propose a different scheme to encourage a better understanding of the nitrogen cycle and interpretation of NO3 − isotopes. We use a mechanistic understanding of NO3 − formation to place bounds on the oxygen isotope axis and provide a means to adjust for different environmental water isotope values, so data from multiple sites and times of year can be appropriately compared. We demonstrate that any interpretation of our example datasets (Canada, Kenya, United Kingdom) show clear evidence of denitrification or a mixture of NO3 − sources simply because many data points fall outside of arbitrary boxes which cannot be supported once the range of potential δ18O-NO3 − values has been considered. © 2019},

abstract={Early warning systems (EWS) for river flooding are strategic tools for effective disaster risk management in many world regions. When driven by ensemble Numerical Weather Predictions (NWP), flood EWS can provide skillful streamflow forecasts beyond the monthly time scale in large river basins. Yet, effective flood detection is challenged by accurate estimation of warning thresholds that identify specific hazard levels along the entire river network and forecast horizon. This research describes a novel approach to estimate warning thresholds which retain statistical consistency with the operational forecasts at all lead times. The procedure is developed in the context of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS). A 21-year forecast-consistent dataset is used to derive thresholds with global coverage and forecast range up to six weeks. These are compared with thresholds derived from ERA5, a state of the art atmospheric reanalysis used to run the baseline simulation for the years 1986–2017 and to give a best guess of the present hydrological states. Findings show that the use of constant thresholds for 30-day flood forecasting, as in the current operational GloFAS setup, is consistent throughout the entire forecast range in only 30% to 40% of the river network, depending on the flood return period. Findings show that range-dependent thresholds, of weekly duration, are a more suitable alternative to time-invariant thresholds, as they improve the model consistency as well as the skills in flood monitoring and early warning, particularly over longer forecasting range. © 2019},

abstract={Objectives: To retrospectively review the cases with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL)treated with anterior controllable antedisplacement and fusion (ACAF). Patients with postoperative remaining ossification mass (PROM)are analyzed to figure out the causes and preventions of this problem. Methods: A total of 115 patients were included. PROM was identified as remaining OPLL existed in the spinal canal other than included in the vertebral-OPLL complex on postoperative computed tomography. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association scoring system was used to evaluate the neurologic status. Surgery-related complications such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)leakage and spinal cord or nerve injury were all recorded. The patients with the PROM group and those without the PROM group were compared. Results: There were 14 patients with wide-base OPLL (12.2%)and 10 patients (8.7%)with PROM among the 115 patients with OPLL. The 10 patients with PROM were all with wide-base OPLL. The average improvement rate of Japanese Orthopaedic Association score in patients without PROM was significantly larger than that in patients with PROM (69.5 ± 22.6% vs. 36.7 ± 22.0, P < 0.01). Incidence rate of postoperative CSF leakage and neural deterioration were significantly higher in patients with PROM than that in patients without PROM (CSF leakage, 40.0% vs. 5.9%; neural deterioration, 50.0% vs. 3.0%). No other complications were observed. Conclusions: The occurrence of PROM might cause complications and poor neural function recovery in patients treated with ACAF. Surgical techniques should be noted to avoid PROM in ACAF surgery. © 2019},

abstract={Background: Fusiform superior cerebellar artery (SCA) aneurysms are rare, and their management represents a technical challenge. In complex aneurysms, endovascular parent vessel occlusion of the SCA may be a treatment option. Here, we present 2 cases of fusiform SCA aneurysms, 1 ruptured and 1 unruptured, as well as our institution's management with parent vessel occlusion. We also provide a review of the literature. Cases Description: Case 1: A 42-year-old male was transferred from an outside hospital with subarachnoid hemorrhage. On admission, the patient had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8, a Hunt and Hess grade 4, and a Fisher grade 4. A diagnostic angiogram demonstrated a right SCA fusiform lesion with proximal and distal dilatations of 1.45 mm and 5.35 mm long, respectively, likely representing a single dissecting pseudoaneurysm. The distal dilatation was coiled, resulting in parent vessel occlusion. The patient recovered clinically and was discharged in stable condition. Case 2: A 27-year-old female was transferred from an outside hospital due to a brainstem stroke. A diagnostic angiogram revealed an S2/S3 segment left SCA fusiform lesion, likely representing a dissecting aneurysm. The patient was neurologically intact at admission and managed conservatively. At the 2-month follow-up angiogram, the dissection had extended along the length of the SCA. Consequently, the patient underwent coil embolization of the distal left SCA. At the 6-month follow-up, the vessel remained obliterated and the patient's neurologic status had improved. Conclusions: Endovascular coil embolization of fusiform SCA aneurysms offers a reasonable and safe treatment approach. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={It is great significance to precisely monitor lead (II) ions (Pb2+) for environment protection and human health monitoring. We designed a sensitive detection strategy for sensitive and selective determination of Pb2+, based on a Pb2+-specific DNAzyme as the catalytic unit, Cy3-labeled DNA modified gold nanorods (AuNRs) as SERS reporter. Firstly, AuNRs surface were employed as a platform for the immobilization of thiolated probe DNA, and then hybridized with DNAzyme catalytic beacons. By taking advantage of DNAzyme digest, a molecular beacon, causes a “turn-off” SERS signal by disrupting the labeled probes. Under the optical conditions, the DNAzyme-AuNRs sensor system exhibited high sensitivity, acceptable stability and reproducibility with a wide linear range from 0.5 to 100 nM (R2 = 0.9973), and an ultra-low detection limit of 0.01 nM. The proposed strategy has additional advantages of being less time-consuming, low-cost and remote query, and avoids the interference of some metals such as Fe3+, Cd2+, Ba2+, Cu2+, Zn2+. The SERS biosensor system has been successfully applied for detecting Pb2+ in real samples with a satisfactory result. The result indicated that the proposed sensing strategy not only enriches SERS platform of monitoring Pb2+ but also exhibits potential for the point-of-care diagnostic application of the clinical screening in complicated biological samples. © 2019},

abstract={Peatlands are wetland ecosystems where net primary production exceeds organic matter decomposition. They are characterized by a near-surface water table controlled by a combination of internal and external processes, influenced by short-term meteorological and long-term climate variations among other factors. Site-specific conditions, such as peat hydrodynamic properties, surface vegetation patterns, and hydrogeological setting also substantially influence water table dynamics. The objective of this work was to characterize the influence of hydrogeological setting and meteorological conditions on water table depths (WTD) and on fluctuations therein in seven ombrotrophic peatlands in or near the St. Lawrence Lowlands (southern Quebec, Canada). Up-gradient, mid-gradient, and down-gradient locations were monitored in the seven peatlands, using dipwells with hourly WTD recordings. WTD was also monitored in the marginal minerotrophic zone found in three of the seven peatlands. Additionally, heads in the outflow (i.e., receiving diffused water from the peatland) and inflow (i.e., providing diffused water to the peatland) zones within the adjacent mineral deposits were monitored in seven and three peatlands respectively, using piezometers with hourly hydraulic head recordings. Hydraulic conductivities for the outflow zones ranged between 1.4*10−7 and 8.5*10−3 cm/s, whereas those of the inflow zones ranged between 5.6*10−7 and 3.9*10−6 cm/s. Evapotranspiration was shown to be the dominant factor controlling monthly cumulative water table decreases (MCD), while precipitation dominated the monthly cumulative water table increases (MCI). A strong correlation was found between mean peatland WTD and outflow zone hydraulic conductivity. Peatlands that were identified as being strongly connected with the adjacent mineral deposits in a diffuse underground outflow zone showed the greatest variations in water storage. This study highlights the importance of the connection between peatlands and adjacent mineral deposits in controlling WTD, as found for those located in the St. Lawrence Lowlands. The results show that water table fluctuations are strongly controlled by meteorological conditions, and that hydrogeological setting exerts a strong control on MCI and MCD. Moreover, this work shows that WTD in ombrotrophic peatlands is influenced by the hydraulic conductivity of the outflow zones, and confirms that aquifer – peatland connectivity influences peatland water storage variations, and therefore peatland vulnerability to disturbances in aquifer groundwater levels. © 2019},

abstract={G-quadruplex has been an emerging target for drug design due to its physiologically important roles in oncology. A number of quadruplex-interactive ligands have been developed by synthetic and medicinal chemists over the past decades. However, the great challenge still remains that the method for detecting the specific targeting of these ligands to the G-quadruplex structures in cells is still lacking. Herein, a detection system for directly identifying the specific targeting of a ligand to DNA G-quadruplexes in cells was constructed by using a small-molecular fluorescent probe (IMT) as a fluorescent indicator. Four typical ligands have been successfully evaluated, demonstrating the promising application of this detection system in the screening and evaluation of quadruplex-specific therapeutic agents. © 2019},

abstract={Photoluminescence (PL) features arising from intraconfigurational 4f – 4f transitions and also O 2− → Ln 3+ charge transfer (CT) where Ln 3+ = Yb 3+ , Sm 3+ or Eu 3+ are observed for Ln-doped NaMgF 3 with oxygen impurities. The peak CT stimulation energies are 4.54 eV, &gt;5.1 eV, and 3.65 eV for Yb 3+ , Sm 3+ and Eu 3+ , respectively. Exciting into the CT bands produces intense 4f – 4f emissions characteristic of the Ln 3+ dopant in all cases. The CT peak excitation energies are used to construct a host-referred binding energy (HRBE) diagram for all Ln 3+ and Ln 2+ dopants, which can then be referenced to understand the luminescence and trapping properties of Ln 3+ and Ln 2+ ions in all NaMgF 3 :Ln compounds. We demonstrate that the HRBE accurately describes the electron trapping in NaMgF 3 :Yb where Yb 3+ + e − → Yb 2+ after exposure to X-ray irradiation that is stable under UV exposure to stimulation energies up to at least 5 eV. Furthermore, the first 5d levels of the studied Ln 2+ dopants are well described within the HRBE diagram. For NaMgF 3 :Eu, two unique Eu 3+ sites are observed where one is highly distorted and is primarily excited by CT, likely due to an adjacent O 2− impurity. For the distorted site, the peak intensity of the 5 D 0 → 7 F 0 emission is approximately 30 times greater than that of the 5 D 0 → 7 F 1 emission. Ultimately, the incorporation of oxygen impurities into the NaMgF 3 lattice is shown to enhance Ln 3+ luminescence, and the constructed HRBE diagram will be useful for future studies of the compound. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Understanding the drivers and timescales over which groundwater quality changes informs groundwater management, use, and protection. To better understand timescales of water-quality change over short (daily to monthly) and long (seasonal to decadal) timescales, the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Enhanced Trends Network (ETN) program instrumented and sampled three wells in the Edwards aquifer in south-central Texas. The wells were instrumented to provide high-frequency continuous (subhourly) water-quality data (temperature, pH, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen), which were augmented by the collection of discrete samples (about 6 per year) for a range of geochemical constituents (including selected isotopes and age tracers). ETN data (2013–2017) are considered with data from additional sites for the same time period, and also historical records (over more than 80 years) of climatic and hydrologic conditions. During the four-year study, hydrologic conditions transitioned from very dry to very wet. Sites in the updip/unconfined part of the aquifer showed notable changes in water level and geochemistry (1) in response to rainfall/recharge events, and (2) over the multiyear dry/wet cycle. Sites in the downdip/confined part of the aquifer showed changes in water level/spring discharge over similar timescales, although the response is more muted. Geochemistry at the downdip/confined sites, however, varied slowly and minimally, indicating that the geochemical response of the deeper aquifer is decoupled from recent hydrologic responses. Changes at the updip/unconfined sites reflect mixing with recent recharge, whereas the downdip/confined sites were dominated by mineral-solution reactions resulting from longer (decadal) residence times. Mean groundwater ages interpreted from measured age tracers and lumped parameter models range from 7 to >700 years (where mixed with premodern downdip water) but were mostly modern. The aquifer is characterized by updip-to-downdip trends in geochemistry with respect to water-rock interaction and groundwater age. Fourier spectral analysis of historical records indicate hydrologic variability has occurred at dominant periods of 30 and 15 years; in conjunction with age tracers, these results provide insight into timescales at which the aquifer's public supply is vulnerable to changes in the water quality of recharge. © 2019},

abstract={Background: Radiation-induced aneurysms have been previously reported; however, multiple and repeated de novo aneurysm formation chronologically and anatomically during long-term follow-up have not yet been observed. The pathogenesis of persistent radiation-induced vasculopathy is not fully understood. Case Description: A 31-year-old woman presented with intraventricular hemorrhage due to rupture of a right internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm that developed 17 years after surgical resection of a low-grade glioma in the right frontal lobe and postoperative radiotherapy (focal, 50 Gy/25 fractions). During glioma follow-up, salvage surgery with adjuvant gamma knife therapy and chemotherapy (ranimustine, vincristine, temozolomide) were performed for recurrence of the glioma. The aneurysm was treated with endovascular coil embolization. However, she experienced repeated intraventricular hemorrhages, and angiography revealed a de novo ICA aneurysm. The de novo aneurysms were treated with endovascular surgery using coil embolization and stenting. At 2 years after the third hemorrhage, the surgical wound became dehiscent, probably due to wound infection, thus epicranial soft tissue reconstruction using vascularized skin flap was performed. Despite multistaged endovascular surgery for the ICA aneurysm, she experienced repeated subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhages. Angiography revealed a de novo aneurysm of the right posterior cerebral artery and basilar trunk. She underwent coil embolization and stenting. Despite active management with endovascular surgery and close follow-up, she died after an eighth consecutive intraventricular and intracerebral hemorrhage caused by a de novo large aneurysm of the posterior cerebral artery.

abstract={This study assessed the solute permeability of a family of UV and moisture cured acrylates-based adhesives during in vitro ageing in pH 7.4 buffer. Acrylates have a potential role in bone fracture fixation, but their inability to allow microsolute exchange between the fractured bone surfaces may contribute to ineffective healing. Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry were used to determine the diffusion coefficients for various electrochemically active probe molecules (O 2, H 2 O 2 , acetaminophen, catechol, uric acid and ascorbic acid) at proprietary acrylic, urethane – acrylate and cyanoacrylate adhesives. All adhesives proved to be impermeable for up to 9 days ageing, following which a near-exponential increase in permeability resulted for all solutes. At 18 days, the diffusion coefficients were in the range of 10 −5 cm 2 s −1 for O 2 and H 2 O 2 and 10 −6 cm 2 s −1 for the organic solutes; no transport selectivity was seen between the latter. Adhesive joint strength showed a direct, inverse, correlation with permeability, with the more hydrophilic cyanoacrylates showing the greatest loss of strength. Adhesive permeabilisation does not appear to be compatible with the retention of bonding strength, but it serves as a new non-destructive predictor of adhesion strength change during ageing and practical use. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Fugitive emissions or unintentional losses of gas (e.g. leaks) are a significant source of greenhouse gases within the oil and gas sector. Previous work has demonstrated the potential of a scalar transport adjoint method for using sparse sensor data to locate and quantify multiple simultaneous unknown fugitive emission sources within a bluff-body dominated facility environment. This paper builds directly on that work and demonstrates the significant computational time reductions that can be achieved by modifying this approach to use a database of pre-computed retro-tracers (PRT). The computational cost, as well as estimated source emission rates and locations, were compared for both an open field release and multiple releases in a bluff-body dominated domain when using the PRT method versus the concurrent gas transport computations from previous work. For the open-field release, given the same wind input there were no significant differences in results of the two approaches. For the bluff-body dominated multiple source case (a domain representative of an actual gas plant), using simplified wind fields for the PRT database generation allowed major sources to be successfully located. The emission rates were computed within −75% to −32% of their actual value. When the wind direction coverage was increased to 110° from ∼60°, the emission rate computations improved to within approximately −30% to −25%. The total computational cost for both methods was of a similar order of magnitude when including the initial database generation for the PRT method, but non-reusable computational time was reduced by a factor of 200–600 times making the PRT method feasible on a standard desktop computer once the database is generated. This is a noteworthy achievement as it raises the possibility of continuous or near-continuous characterization of unknown fugitive emissions sources within a complex facility which could allow sources to be identified as they arise. © 2019 The Author(s)},

In these bi-layer screens, the top (front) screen is made of metallic hole-array and the bottom(back) screen ismade ofmetallic disk-array. The gap between themis filled with an array of dielectric spheres. The spheres are embedded in a dielectric host material, which is made of either a heat-insulating (air, polyimide) or heat-conducting (MgO) layer. Electromagnetic intensity trapping of 97% is obtained when a 0.15 micron gap is filled with MgO and Si spheres, which are treated as pure dielectrics (namely, with no added absorption loss). Envisioned applications are anti-fogging surfaces, electromagnetic shields, and energy harvesting structures. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Background: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a cardinal feature of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). However, whether to treat brain AVMs in patients with HHT remains questionable because of the possible risks. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of patients with HHT who had been treated for brain AVMs at our institution from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2016. An institutional database was queried for the phrases “hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia” and “HHT,” and those patients who had been treated during the study period were identified. Data were extracted regarding presentation, AVM characteristics, treatment modality, and treatment outcomes. Results: We identified 14 patients (10 males, 4 females) with HHT who had had AVMs (n = 27) from the institutional database. The mean age of the patients was 43 years (range, 2–64). Of the 27 brain AVMs, 13 were Spetzler-Martin grade I, 12 were grade II, and 2 were grade III; none were grade IV or V. Treatment was by microsurgery only (11 AVMs in 10 patients), embolization followed by microsurgery (2 AVMs in 2 patients), and radiosurgery only (12 AVMs in 2 patients). AVM obliteration was achieved in 100% of the patients. No new fixed neurologic deficits developed after treatment of unruptured HHT AVMs. Conclusions: The risk of treatment of brain AVMs in patients with HHT is quite low for appropriately selected patients with treatment individualized to radiosurgery, microsurgery, or a combination of embolization and microsurgery. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Source-term estimation (STE) methods attempt to calculate the most-likely source characteristics of an atmospheric release given concentration observations. The quality of the STE depends partially on the time and space scales of the observations, sensor locations, and release parameters. We quantify the sensitivity of a probabilistic STE algorithm that was previously validated using observational data collected during a controlled tracer release experiment to the spatiotemporal resolution of observing networks. We have also made many improvements to the STE algorithm, which extends applicability to coarser-resolution observational datasets. Improvements include the use of a fully-connected deep neural network model emulator with dynamically optimized architecture and better goodness-of-fit (GoF) metrics to measure the discrepancy between model and observational data. The GoF metrics, which are more robust and resilient than previous metrics, are the Spearman rank-based correlation coefficient and a variation of the binary f1 classification score adapted for regression problems. Using synthetically generated observations over East Asia, the skill of the improved algorithm is quantified over a broad range of sensor configurations and release scenarios. The evaluation is broken into three experiments. First, a validation study shows that the proposed GoF metrics perform more reliably than other possible candidates. Next, data-denial techniques are applied to a single release scenario over the Korean peninsula, where the skill of the inversion is shown to be highly sensitive to the number and location of deployed sensors but less sensitive to temporal resolution. Finally, the STE algorithm is tested for many release locations throughout the geographic model domain, where the STE algorithm performs well for all but a few cases. The results indicate that the STE algorithm provides informative source-parameter posterior probability distributions utilizing data collected by sparse sensor networks; however, the skill of the STE algorithm improves significantly for higher resolution networks. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Forecasts of tropical cyclones have seen rapid improvements in recent years as expanding computational capacity permits more runs of finer resolution meteorological models with increasing representation of physical processes. However, the utilization of a hydrodynamic component in these models is often neglected, meaning flood forecasts typically output point water levels that give little indication of a projected inundation extent on the ground. Here, we append this critical component to the forecast cascade by coupling Fathom-US, a continental-scale hydraulic model which employs the LISFLOOD-FP numerical scheme, to forecasts of streamflow, rainfall and coastal surge height from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Medium-term (2–15 days) flood inundation forecasts, as well as hindcasts driven by real-time observations, were executed for Hurricane Harvey by rapidly simulating pluvial and coastal flood hazard and extracting fluvial flood maps from an existing US-wide simulation library. The resultant ~30 m resolution depth grids were then validated against post-event observations collated by the US Geological Survey. Across the disaster zone, the hindcast (forecast) model captured, on average, 78% (75%) of the benchmark flood extent, obtained a Critical Success Index of 0.66 (0.57) and deviated from observed high water marks by ~1 m (~1.2 m). When compared to a simpler GIS-based approach, the hydraulic model exhibited much higher skill in replicating observations. This study shows that fully hydrodynamic approaches can be practicably employed in large-scale forecast frameworks at high resolution to produce skillful projections of inundation extent without significantly affecting the forecast lead time. © 2019 The Author(s)},

All these studies indicate that there is a weak intermacromolecular hydrogen bonding between these polymers, which facilitates their complete miscibility in solid state. These films were formulated with sodium fluorescein as a model drug and were evaluated for their potential application in ocular drug delivery both in vitro and in vivo.

abstract={Bubble-induced turbulence (BIT) is a two-phase flow phenomenon characterized by complex interfacial interactions that fundamentally alter the resulting liquid turbulent kinetic energy distribution, budgets, and scales. Incorporating this complexity into a BIT model remains a formidable challenge, as existing two-equation BIT closures struggle with accurately predicting the turbulent kinetic energy and mean flow profiles. The present work assembles a BIT model that incorporates additional physical understanding into its formulation by leveraging insights garnered from experiments, DNS, and previous assessment. The model comprises new turbulent viscosity and time-scale formulations, in addition to optimized values for the modulation parameter, dissipation coefficient, and newly proposed turbulent viscosity multiplier. Improved model performance is demonstrated through simulation of air/water experimental cases and direct comparison with existing closures, which includes qualitative inspection of individual sets as well as quantitative assessment of the turbulent kinetic energy error distribution. Future work delving into momentum closure development, new experimental campaigns, and DNS parametric studies is motivated and linked to BIT model improvements. © 2019},

abstract={The large-eddy simulation (LES) model uDALES is used to evaluate the predictive skill of the operational air quality model SIRANE. The use of LES in this study presents a novel approach to air quality model evaluation, avoiding sources of uncertainty and providing numerical control that permits systematic analysis of targeted parametrisations and assumptions. A case study is conducted over South Kensington, London with the morphology, emissions, meteorological conditions and boundary conditions carefully matched in both models. The dispersion of both inert (NOx) and reactive (NO, NO2 and O3) pollutants under neutral, steady-state conditions is simulated for a south-westerly and westerly wind direction. A quantitative comparison between the two models is performed using statistical indices (the fractional bias, FB, the normalised mean squared error, NMSE, and the fraction in a factor of 2, FAC2). SIRANE is shown to successfully capture the dominant trends with respect to canyon-averaged concentrations of inert NOx (FB = −0.08, NMSE = 0.08 and FAC2 = 1.0). The prediction of along-canyon velocities is shown to exhibit sources of systematic error dependant on the angle of incidence of the mean wind (FB = −0.18). The assumption of photostationarity within SIRANE (deviations from equilibrium of up to 170% exist close to busy roads) is also identified as a significant source of systematic bias resulting in over- and underpredictions of NO2 (FB = −0.18) and O3 (FB = 0.14) respectively. The validity of the assumed uniform in-canyon concentration is assessed by analysing the pedestrian, leeward and windward concentrations resolved in uDALES. The use of canyon-averaged concentrations to predict pedestrian level exposure is shown to result in significant underestimations. Linear regression is used to effectively capture the relationship between pedestrian- and canyon-averaged concentrations in uDALES. Correction factors are derived (m≈1.62 and R2=0.92 for inert NOx) that are capable of significantly improving SIRANE's ability to assess pedestrian level exposure for the conditions investigated in this study. The prevalence of intersections and advective nature of the shear layer are highlighted as important differences between modelling real heterogeneous urban morphology and idealised infinite canyons. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Voltage-dependent anion channel isoform 2 of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yVDAC2) was believed for many years to be devoid of channel activity. Recently, we isolated yVDAC2 and showed that it exhibits channel-forming activity in the planar lipid bilayer system when in its so-called native form. Here, we describe an alternative strategy for yVDAC2 isolation, through heterologous expression in bacteria and refolding in vitro. Recombinant yVDAC2, like its native form, is able to form voltage-dependent channels. However, some differences between native and recombinant yVDAC2 emerged in terms of voltage dependence and ion selectivity, suggesting that, in this specific case, the recombinant protein might be depleted of post-translational modification(s) that occur in eukaryotic cells. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={In many cities worldwide, modern fleets have been introduced to reduce gaseous and particle emissions from city buses. To date, most emission studies are limited to a few vehicles, making a statistically significant assessment of control options difficult, especially under real-world driving conditions. Exhaust emissions of 234 individual city buses were measured under real-world stop-and-go traffic conditions at a bus stop in Gothenburg, Sweden. The buses comprised models fulfilling Euro III-VI and EEV (Enhanced Environmentally Friendly Vehicle) standards with different engine technologies, fuels, and exhaust after-treatment systems, and also included hybrid-electric buses (HEV). Both gaseous (NOx, CO, HC, and SO2) and size-resolved particle number (PN) and mass (PM) emission factors (EF) were calculated for vehicles using compressed natural gas (CNG), diesel (DSL), Rapeseed Methyl Ester (RME) and Hydro-treated Vegetable Oil (HVO) equipped with various after-treatment technologies, e.g., diesel particulate filter (DPF), selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) systems. The highest median EFPN was obtained from Euro VHEV-HVO-SCR buses (MdEFPN = 18×1014 # kg-1) when their combustion engines were used though 53% of their accelerations were below detection limits indicating the use of their electrical engine. The highest MdEFPM was obtained from the Euro V-DSL-SCR buses (MdEFPM = 150 mg kg-1) and the lowest from EEV-CNG buses (below detection threshold) and Euro VIHEV-HVO- SCR+EGR+DPF buses (MdEFPM = 19 mg kg-1). The highest MdEFNOx was obtained from the Euro V-RME-SCR (MdEFNOx = 30 g kg-1) and Euro VHEV-HVO-SCR buses (MdEFNOx = 24 g kg-1), and the lowest from CNG buses (MdEFNOx = 4.8 g kg-1) and Euro VIHEV-HVO-SCR+EGR+DPF buses (MdEFNOx = 7.4 g kg-1). Hybrid buses can give higher PN emissions compared to traditional diesel engines, likely due to downsized combustion engines. Replacing diesel by biodiesel fuel reduced MdEFPM significantly but increased MdEFNOx which may be due to the higher combustion temperature and oxygen contents of the fuel (for RME). Overall, the EEV-CNG buses performed the best regarding both the MdEF and low contribution to the high emitters. It was also found that a small (5%) proportion of the buses contributed significantly (14-30%) to the total emissions. Identification and monitoring the maintenance of the high emitters in the fleets should be considered for the improvement of air quality. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Combining metamodels with data assimilation schemes allows the incorporation of up-to-date information in metamodels, offering new opportunities for operational water resources management. We developed a data assimilation scheme for the unsaturated zone metamodel MetaSWAP using OpenDA, which is an open source data assimilation framework. A twin experiment showed the feasibility of applying an Ensemble Kalman filter as a data assimilation method for updating metamodels. Furthermore, we assessed the accuracy of root zone soil moisture model estimates when assimilating the regional SMAP L3 Enhanced surface soil moisture product. The model accuracy is assessed using in situ soil moisture measurements collected at 12 locations in the Twente region, the Netherlands. Although the accuracy of the model estimates does not improve in terms of correlation coefficient, the accuracy does improve in terms of Root Mean Square Error and bias. Therefore, the assimilation of surface soil moisture observations has value for updating root zone soil moisture model estimates. In addition, the accuracy of the model estimates improves on both regional and local spatial scales. The increasing availability of remotely sensed soil moisture data will lead to new possibilities for integrating metamodelling and data assimilation in operational water resources management. However, we expect that significant investments in computational capacities are necessary for effective implementation in decision-making. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={The MJD family of human deubiquitinating enzymes contains four members: Ataxin-3, the ataxin-3-like protein (AT3L), Josephin-1, and Josephin-2. All share a conserved catalytic unit known as the Josephin domain. Ataxin-3 and AT3L also contain extensive regulatory regions that modulate their functions, whereas Josephins-1 and -2 are substantially smaller, containing only the Josephin domain. To gain insight into how these minimal Josephins differ from their larger relatives, we determined the 2.3 Å X-ray crystal structure of human Josephin-2 and probed the enzyme's substrate specificity. Several large disordered loops are seen in the structure, suggesting a highly dynamic enzyme. Josephin-2 lacks several allosteric sites found in ataxin-3, but its structure suggests potential regulation via ubiquitination of a loop adjoining the active site. The enzyme preferentially recognizes substrates containing K11, K48, and K63 linkages, pointing toward a possible role in maintenance of protein quality control. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Background: Despite the most recent surgical aids and tools, surgical removal of infiltrating brain tumors remains a challenge. Unclear margins, edematous areas, and infiltrative behavior are the main causes for failing gross total removals. Also, excessive resection of peri-tumoral tissue often carries risks of damaging the nearby functioning cortical and subcortical structures with an unacceptable decrease in patient's quality of life and postoperative functional status, and the risk of making patients not eligible to adjuvant treatments. Awake surgery and intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (ioMRI) are among the most effective aids in preventing damage to functional brain while maximizing the extent of resection. Methods: We present our series of 46 patients operated on at Southmead Hospital (North Bristol NHS Trust) in between July 2014 and February 2017 using ioMRI plus or minus awake surgery. Setting, patient features, indications, type and size of tumors, surgical times, extent of resection, morbidity, and survival are analyzed and discussed. Results: Overall, ioMRI check led to a +43% resections in Group 1 and +58% in Group 2. In grade 2 tumors, GTR was 46% in Group 1 and 55% in Group 2 (41% in control group). In grade 3 tumors, GTR was 57% in Group 1 and 66% in Group 2 (30% in control group). In Grade 4 tumors, GTR was 63% in Group 1, 66% in Group 2 (36% in control group). In terms of theatre occupation, the use of ioMRI added 1/2 operative session; the addition of awake surgery implied the use of another 1/2 operative session. Morbidity did not differ among the groups, with low incidence of permanent post-operative deficits (<5%). Group 2 OS was statistically longer when compared to the control group. Conclusions: Using ioMRI together with awake surgery is demanding for the anesthetic team, staff nurses, and for the patient. Nevertheless, low morbidity, greater total resections rates, and longer survival suggest its use is effective in making more approachable gliomas of all grades that we would consider “complex” due to their intrinsic features or locations. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={In the context of climate change, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is a global concern. Recent publications estimate that 30–40% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gases are directly emitted by urban areas. This paper focuses on CO2, which is the main anthropogenic greenhouse gas, and presents an implementation of CO2 flux modelling in urban areas within the urban canopy model Town Energy Balance (TEB). Highly weather-dependent contributors to CO2 fluxes (buildings and vegetation) are explicitly modelled by TEB using the Building Energy Model (BEM) for buildings and Interactions between Soil, Biosphere and Atmosphere (ISBA) for urban vegetation. This approach allows the impacts of the urban microclimate on CO2 fluxes to be simulated. Non-weather-dependent contributors (traffic and human respiration) are simulated using simpler approaches. A sensitivity study applied to the centre of Toulouse, France, highlights the relevance of detailed input data related to traffic, building use and human behaviour to simulate accurate CO2 fluxes. The results show that traffic (48.5%) and buildings (42%) are the main contributors to the annual mean CO2 flux. A comparison of the model results with independent eddy-covariance flux data shows good agreement with a root mean square error of 15.3 μmol m−2 s−1 and demonstrates that the model is able to reproduce seasonally averaged daily cycles of CO2 fluxes. In future studies, this model can be used to quantify the impacts on CO2 fluxes of different urban development scenarios such as urban expansion, changes in urban form, changes in practices related to the heating of buildings or urban greening strategies. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Analyses of 20-year records of emissions and ambient air pollutant concentrations were combined with receptor modeling to enhance current understanding of the relative contributions of different emission source types to fine particle (PM2.5) elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) fractions in New York State. Two receptor models, principal component analysis (PCA) and positive matrix factorization (PMF), were applied to determine trends in source contributions to OC and EC at the principal study site, Pinnacle State Park (PSP), between 2001 and 2015. The PSP results are interpreted in relation to state and regional emission and pollutant trends. Multi-site average SO4 concentrations showed a linear relationship to reductions in anthropogenic emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in New York, surrounding states, and eastern Canada from 6.1 million metric tons in 1995 to 1.0 million metric tons in 2015. On average, 0.5 ± 0.1 μg m-3 sulfate (SO4) originated from natural SO2 emissions or from outside the region. Emission-reduction programs yielded measurable reductions of ambient OC, EC, and SO4 concentrations, but OC and EC improvements at PSP were partly offset by increasing concentrations of biomass-burning OC and EC. Between 2001 and 2015, biomass burning contributions increased the PSP 2001–2003 mean EC and OC concentrations by 13–18% and 23–30%, respectively. With decreases in other source contributions, net total reductions of PSP 2001–2003 mean EC and OC concentrations were 36–58% and 26–45%, respectively. Contributions to PSP EC and OC declined from four source types: (1) fossil-fuel combustion associated with SO2, (2) combustion not associated with SO2 (tentatively identified as mobile sources), (3) crustal OC and EC, and (4) sulfate-associated OC and EC. SO2-associated fossil-fuel and biomass-burning OC and EC concentrations were higher in winter, sulfate and non-SO2 combustion OC and EC concentrations were higher in summer, and crustal OC and EC were higher in spring. Spatial and temporal coherence of mean OC and EC concentrations, which was observed as a constant slope of annual-average OC-vs-EC across sites and years, indicates that multiple sites were influenced by similar emission source types and responded similarly to emission reductions during the study period. The lowest mean annual OC and EC concentrations were recorded at the most remote site, Whiteface Mountain Base (WMB), averaging 1.0 ± 0.05 μg m-3 and 0.2 ± 0.01 μg m-3, respectively; these values may represent regional background concentrations. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={In this study, we compared the aerosol profiles derived from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) over China with those simulated by the Global 3-D Atmospheric Chemical Transport model (GEOS-Chem) for the period of 2007–2014. Multiple steps were implemented in the data analysis. First, we validated CALIPSO and GEOS-Chem aerosol optical depth (AOD) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, both CALIPSO and GEOS-Chem AOD were found to 30%∼50% underestimations in eastern China and 60%∼80% underestimations in western China. Second, MODIS AOD was introduced to normalize the aerosol extinction coefficient (AEC) of both CALIPSO and GEOS-Chem in each 1-km layer below 10 km to achieve a uniform comparison. Linear regression analysis between the normalized CALIPSO and GEOS-Chem AECs yielded better correlation coefficients and lower mean relative differences than the direct comparisons from the original data. Finally, we investigated the vertical distributions of aerosol components over the North, South, Northwest and Tibet regions of China. Our findings are summarized based on different aerosol components as the following. Dust aerosols: The percentages of CALIPSO polluted dust to total dust in the North and South regions (50%∼68% in different seasons) are higher than those in the Northwest and Tibet regions (25%∼45%). Thus, the polluted dust classification significantly affects our comparisons in the North and South. For CALIPSO pure dust, its concentrations in the higher layers are larger than those of GEOS-Chem. Continental/sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium (SNA) aerosols: The percentages of CALIPSO continental aerosols to total aerosols are almost negligible throughout the four regions (<10%). Even including the polluted dust in the continental aerosol, their combined contributions remain ∼10% lower than GEOS-Chem SNA. Thus, we found that the current CALIPSO aerosol classification scheme is limited in the detection of anthropogenic aerosols in China. Soot aerosols: The GEOS-Chem soot aerosol values are a factor of 2–4 times lower than those of CALIPSO. The omission of small agricultural field burnings in the GEOS-Chem emission inventory might have resulted in the soot aerosol underestimations. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Australia is currently canine rabies free. However, communities located on the northern coastline–such as the Northern Peninsula Area (NPA), Queensland–are at risk of an incursion due to their large populations of susceptible free-roaming dogs and proximity to rabies-infected Indonesian islands. A rabies-spread model was used to simulate potential outbreaks and evaluate various disease control strategies. A heterogeneous contact structure previously described in the population of interest–explorer dogs, roamer dogs and stay-at-home dogs–was incorporated into the model using six spatial kernels describing contacts between dog roaming categories. Twenty-seven vaccination strategies were investigated based on a complete block design of 50%, 70% and 90% coverage for each of the three roaming categories to simulate various targeted vaccination strategies. The 27 strategies were implemented in four population structures in which the proportion of dogs in each category varied–explorer dominant, roamer dominant, stay-at-home dominant and a field population (based on field estimates of population structure). The overall vaccination coverage varied depending on the subpopulation targeted for vaccination and the population structure modelled. A total of 108 scenarios were simulated 2000 times and the model outputs (outbreak size and duration) were compared to Strategy 14 (a standard recommended overall 70% vaccination coverage). In general, targeting explorer dogs–and to a lesser extent roamer dogs–produced similar outbreaks to Strategy 14 but with a lower overall vaccination coverage. Similarly, strategies that targeted stay-at-home dogs required a higher vaccination coverage to produce significantly smaller and shorter outbreaks. This study provides some theoretical evidence that targeting subpopulations of dogs for vaccination based on their roaming behaviours (and therefore risk of rabies transmission) could be more efficient than blanket 70% vaccination campaigns. Such information can be used in preparedness planning to help improve control of a potential rabies incursion in Australia. © 2019 Hudson et al.},

The prevalence of background conditions in the measurement site has been determined for the period of study. These conditions, which constitute more than 80% of cases, are occasionally altered, mainly by high aerosols loading, as a consequence of biomass-burning events. Biomass-burning periods cover every year from mid-July to mid-October. The identification of these periods has been possible through the classification of aerosols in 6 subtypes. The month with the maximum AOD monthly average is September, and in 2016, the absolute maximum value of 0.91 was registered. The mean AOD value for the study period is 0.10 ± 0.07 and the alpha mean value is 1.49 ± 0.36, indicating presence, of small size aerosols. Some aerosol optical properties were analyzed in order to validate the aerosol classification. The aerosol size distribution revealed a bimodal character with a slight predominance of the fine mode, related to the two main types of aerosols: continental and biomass. © 2019},

abstract={Relationships between regional air pollutant emissions and ambient concentration trends in New York State are studied. Large (∼50–85%) reductions in anthropogenic emissions occurred in the northeastern U.S. and eastern Canada between 1995 and 2015. Spatially and temporally aggregated ambient concentrations of O3 precursors declined steadily along with emission reductions: multi-site mean annual nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and toluene concentrations tracked state and regional emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx, NO + NO2), CO, and volatile organic compounds (VOC), respectively (r2 = 0.97, 0.88, and 0.73), showing linear responses of average O3 precursor concentrations to both state and regional emission reductions. O3 exhibited complex spatial and temporal variations, indicating that O3 was influenced not only by the steady decline of regional emissions but also by subregional emission changes, chemical and physical processes, and day-specific variations in emissions and weather. The statewide multi-site mean annual 4th-highest daily 8-h O3 peak declined at the rate of 0.86 ± 0.14 ppbv y−1 (1.1% y−1). Influences on peak daily 8-h O3 were studied using a long-term data record from a research site at Pinnacle State Park (PSP), located near Addison, New York. A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied to separate the influences of local and regional emission changes, weather, and other factors. GAM results indicate that the reduction of summer O3 peak values and the overall trends in O3 at PSP were due to changes in ambient pollutant levels, rather than to trends in temperature or other meteorological factors. Whereas PSP summer O3 was NOx-sensitive, O3 was often VOC-sensitive during winter and spring days. The frequency of VOC-sensitive days decreased between 2001 – 2005 and 2012–2016, consistent with an expectation of increasing NOx sensitivity as ambient NOx concentrations decline. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Several datasets of PM2.5 concentrations over Europe during the 1990–2015 period, were used to calculate health impacts from chronic exposure to total particle matter below 2.5 μm (i.e. PM2.5). The datasets used in the analysis include the European Topic Centre on Air Pollution and Climate Change Mitigation (ETC/ACM), the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS), the Global Burden of Disease (GBD), the World Health Organization (WHO) as well as the EURODELTA-Trends (EDT) multi-model reanalysis developed specifically for Europe. The exposure to ambient PM2.5 concentrations was calculated as population weighted annual average PM2.5 concentrations by country. The calculated exposure to PM2.5 was later used as input in the health impact assessment (HIA) Alpha-RiskPoll (ARP) tool to retrieve the total number of premature deaths. Our results indicate a substantial reduction in the number of premature deaths from PM2.5 exposure in Europe over the 1990–2010 period, between nearly 30 and 50%. Putting all the data-sets together, even if they do not cover the whole period, a decrease of even around 60% is observed between 1990 and 2015. For the countries included in this study, the estimated number of premature deaths from PM2.5 in 1990 was found to be around 960 000 (median of all the available datasets), whereas in 2015 it was found to be around 445 000. However, the variability in the estimated premature deaths from the different PM2.5 datasets was found to be large during the early 90s (around a factor of 2). For the latest years of the investigated period (2005 onwards), where a relatively flat trend in the PM2.5 exposure was observed, the differences between the different datasets were smaller. Even though our results indicate a reduction in the number of premature deaths from chronic exposure to PM2.5, the numbers remain considerable in 2015, underlining the need to continue improving air quality in the future. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Elevated ozone (O3) pollution is observed every spring over the Northern Indian region including the Himalayan foothills, with a maximum typically in the month of May. However, studies investigating influences of photochemistry and dynamics in the valleys of Central Himalaya are limited. Here, in situ surface O3 observations conducted at Dehradun (77.99° E, 30.27° N, 600 m above mean sea level) in the Doon Valley during April–July 2018 are presented. These O3 observations reveal the prevalence of an urban environment over Dehradun with enhanced levels during noontime (66.4 ppbv ± 11.0 ppbv in May) and lower levels during night (26.7 ppbv ± 11.5 ppbv). Morning time O3 enhancement rate at Dehradun (7.5 ppbv h−1) is found to be comparable to that at Bode (7.3 ppbv h−1) in another valley of Himalayan foothills (Kathmandu), indicating stronger anthropogenic emissions in the Doon Valley as well. Daily average O3 at Dehradun varied in the range of 13.7–71.3 ppbv with hourly values reaching up to 103.1 ppbv during the study period. Besides the in situ photochemical O3 production, the entrainment of O3-rich air through boundary layer dynamics also contributes in noontime O3 enhancement in the Doon Valley. Monthly average O3 at Dehradun (49.3 ppbv ± 19.9 ppbv) is observed to be significantly higher than that over urban sites in Northern India (35–41 ppbv) and Bode (38.5 ppbv) in the Kathmandu Valley during May. O3 photochemical buildup, estimated to be 30.3 ppbv and 39.7 ppbv during April and May, respectively, is significantly lower in June (21.2 ppbv). Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) model simulations successfully reproduce the observed variability in noontime O3 at Dehradun (r = 0.86); however, absolute O3 levels were typically overestimated. The positive relationship between CAMS O3 and CO (r = 0.65) together with an O3/CO slope of 0.16 is attributed to the influences of biomass burning besides anthropogenic emissions on observed O3 variations in the Doon Valley. O3 observations show an enhancement by 35–56% at Dehradun during a high-fire activity period in May 2018 as compared to a low-fire activity period over the Northern Indian region in agreement with the enhancement found in CAMS O3 fields (10–65%) over the region in the vicinity of Dehradun. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Human water use, climate change and land conversion have created a water crisis for billions of individuals and many ecosystems worldwide. Global water stocks and fluxes are estimated empirically and with computer models, but this information is conveyed to policymakers and researchers through water cycle diagrams. Here we compiled a synthesis of the global water cycle, which we compared with 464 water cycle diagrams from around the world. Although human freshwater appropriation now equals half of global river discharge, only 15% of the water cycle diagrams depicted human interaction with water. Only 2% of the diagrams showed climate change or water pollution—two of the central causes of the global water crisis—which effectively conveys a false sense of water security. A single catchment was depicted in 95% of the diagrams, which precludes the representation of teleconnections such as ocean–land interactions and continental moisture recycling. These inaccuracies correspond with specific dimensions of water mismanagement, which suggest that flaws in water diagrams reflect and reinforce the misunderstanding of global hydrology by policymakers, researchers and the public. Correct depictions of the water cycle will not solve the global water crisis, but reconceiving this symbol is an important step towards equitable water governance, sustainable development and planetary thinking in the Anthropocene. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={Oral inhalation of drugs is the classic therapy of obstructive lung diseases. In contrast to the oral route, the link between in vitro and in vivo findings is less well defined and predictive models and parameters for in vitro-in vivo correlations are missing. Frequently used in vitro models and problems in obtaining in vivo values to establish such models and to identify the action of formulations in vivo are discussed. It may be concluded that major obstacles to link in vitro parameters on in vivo action include lack of treatment adherence and incorrect use of inhalers by patients, variation in inhaler performance, changes by humidity, uncertainties about lung deposition, and difficulties to measure drug levels in epithelial lining fluid and tissue. Physiologically more relevant in vitro models, improvement in inhaler performance, and better techniques for in vivo measurements may help to better understand importance and interactions between individual in vitro parameters in pulmonary delivery. © 2019 by the author.

abstract={The use of high time resolution datasets of aerosol organic and inorganic species as input for receptor models poses a number of challenges. The estimation of uncertainties differ between different analytical methods and the number of chemical species may considerably vary among the different techniques. In this study, an approach to harmonise the uncertainties of different online datasets for their combined use in source apportionment with positive matrix factorization (PMF) is presented. The concentration of inorganic ions, organic fragments and trace elements were measured in a Po Valley background site using offline and online methods. Six-hour PM 2.5 samples were collected on filters and chemical analyses were carried out offline. Parallel hourly online measurements were made using the Xact 625 (CES LLC) XRF analyser and the Q-ACSM (Aerodyne Research Inc.) spectrometer. Online and offline methods produced comparable results for the major chemical component and some trace elements, while others (Ba, Ni, As and Se) showed limited comparability between the two methods. To ensure the consistency of the final PMF results, a multistep approach was adopted. In the first step PMF was run with only the offline dataset, in the second step only the online organic data were used and in a third step the PMF run was executed using only the online inorganic species. In the first three steps running PMF with homogeneous data made it possible to identify the main sources and produce chemical profiles to be used as internal reference for the final fourth step in which all the online species (major inorganic ions, m/z of organic fragments and trace elements) were combined. The sources of the final solution were developed using internally consistent chemical profiles and those from the literature and were validated by analysing the source diurnal variations and by comparison with external tracers. The sources identified were: biomass burning, aged biomass burning, secondary ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate, traffic, steel industry and waste thermal treatment. The source profiles with a large set of organic and inorganic species (87) and associated source diurnal variations resulting from this study are expected to serve as reference for future studies. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Objective: To determine the local control rate and complication rate in the treatment of grade I intracranial meningiomas. Methods: A retrospective study was performed of patients with grade I meningioma who received radiosurgery with a dedicated linear accelerator from January 2002 to August 2012 with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. We performed descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and progression-free survival analysis through a Kaplan-Meier curve. Results: Seventy-five patients with 78 grade I meningiomas received radiosurgery, 39 underwent surgery plus adjuvant radiosurgery, and 36 only radiosurgery. The follow-up median time was 68 months (range, 35–120 months). The tumor control rate was 93%, the 5-year progression-free survival was 92% (95% confidence interval, 77%–98%). Acute toxicity was 2.6%, and grade 1–2 late toxicity was 26.6%. Postradiosurgery edema was the main late morbidity. Age >55 years was the only significant factor for attaining a response >75%. The background of surgery before radiosurgery was the only significant prognostic factor for showing edema (odds ratio 5.78 [95% confidence interval, 2.14–15.64]). Conclusions: The local control rate attained in our series is similar to that reported in other series worldwide; the acute toxicity rate was low and late toxicity was moderate. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Vesicular transport between different membrane compartments is a key process in cell biology required for the exchange of material and information. The complex machinery that executes the formation and delivery of transport vesicles has been intensively studied and yielded a comprehensive view of the molecular principles that underlie the budding and fusion process. Tethering also represents an essential step in each trafficking pathway. It is mediated by Rab GTPases in concert with so-called tethering factors, which constitute a structurally diverse family of proteins that share a similar role in promoting vesicular transport. By simultaneously binding to proteins and/or lipids on incoming vesicles and the target compartment, tethers are thought to bridge donor and acceptor membrane. They thus provide specificity while also promoting fusion. However, how tethering works at a mechanistic level is still elusive. We here discuss the recent advances in the structural and biochemical characterization of tethering complexes that provide novel insight on how these factors might contribute the efficiency of fusion. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

abstract={Clare's (1952) classification system for photosensitisation diseases (types I, II, III and Uncertain) has endured many years of use despite some confusion regarding his secondary, or type III, category, as well as the more recent discovery of two mechanisms (types I and II) of phototoxicity. Therefore, to reduce confusion in terminology, I propose that Clare's four groups be known as primary (or direct), secondary (indirect or hepatogenous), endogenous (aberrant porphyrin synthesis), and idiopathic. The use of the word type can then be reserved for the mechanisms of phototoxicity. Clare's (1952, 1955) papers listed three plants as primary photosensitisers and three as idiopathic. In the literature, several other plants have been associated with photosensitisation in farm animals. Most of these are likely to have a primary pathogenesis; however, the weight of evidence for all but a few is sparse. With respect to plants (and certain mycotoxins and insects) implicated in primary photosensitisation outbreaks, McKenzie's “toxicity confidence rankings” (Australia's Poisonous Plants, Fungi and Cyanobacteria, 2012) has been adapted to “phototoxic agent confidence rankings”. Thus, plants, mycotoxins or insects can be categorised regarding phototoxicity, i.e. definite (A); some evidence (B); suspected (C); or phototoxin isolated but no field cases known (D), and weight of evidence, i.e. field cases (1); experimental feeding produces photosensitisation (2); phototoxin isolated (3); phototoxin produces photosensitisation experimentally (4); and/or correlation of the action spectrum/chromatogram in blood or skin with the absorption spectrum/chromatogram of the phototoxin (5). As a result, confidence rankings ranging from A5 to D1 can be allocated. From the available literature, at least seventeen plant species can be ranked as A5 (definite phototoxicity with a maximum weight of evidence). The relatively recent breakthrough regarding the discovery of phototoxic anthraquinones in Heterophyllaea spp. has led to the serendipitous association of the same and similar anthraquinones as the most likely phototoxins in alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides). © 2019 The Author},

abstract={Exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the leading global environmental risk factor for mortality and disease burden, with associated annual global welfare costs of trillions of dollars. Examined within is the ability of current data to answer a basic question about PM2.5, namely the location of the city with the highest PM2.5 concentration. The ability to answer this basic question serves as an indicator of scientific progress to assess global human exposure to air pollution and as an important component of efforts to reduce its impacts. Despite the importance of PM2.5, we find that insufficient monitoring data exist to answer this basic question about the spatial pattern of PM2.5 at the global scale. Only 24 of 234 countries have more than 3 monitors per million inhabitants, while density is an order of magnitude lower in the vast majority of the world's countries, with 141 having no regular PM2.5 monitoring at all. The global mean population distance to nearest PM2.5 monitor is 220 km, too large for exposure assessment. Efforts to fill in monitoring gaps with estimates from satellite remote sensing, chemical transport modeling, and statistical models have biases at individual monitor locations that can exceed 50 μg m−3. Progress in advancing knowledge about the global distribution of PM2.5 will require a harmonized network that integrates different types of monitoring equipment (regulatory networks, low-cost monitors, satellite remote sensing, and research-grade instrumentation) with atmospheric and statistical models. Realization of such an integrated framework will facilitate accurate identification of the location of the city with the highest PM2.5 concentration and play a key role in tracking the progress of efforts to reduce the global impacts of air pollution. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Environmental chambers have proven to be essential for atmospheric photochemistry research. This historical perspective summarizes chamber research characterizing smog. Experiments with volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-nitrogen oxides (NOx) have characterized O3 and aerosol chemistry. These led to the creation and evaluation of complex reaction mechanisms adopted for various applications. Gas-phase photochemistry was initiated and developed using chamber studies. Post-1950s study of photochemical aerosols began using smog chambers. Much of the knowledge about the chemistry of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) derives from chamber studies complemented with specially designed atmospheric studies. Two major findings emerge from post-1990s SOA experiments: (1) photochemical SOAs hypothetically involve hydrocarbons and oxygenates with carbon numbers of 2, and (2) SOA evolves via more than one generation of reactions as condensed material exchanges with the vapor phase during "aging". These elements combine with multiphase chemistry to yield mechanisms for aerosols. Smog chambers, like all simulators, are limited representations of the atmosphere. Translation to the atmosphere is complicated by constraints in reaction times, container interactions, influence of precursor injections, and background species. Interpretation of kinetics requires integration into atmospheric models addressing the combined effects of precursor emissions, surface exchange, hydrometeor interactions, air motion and sunlight. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={The consumption of rice milk has increased, mainly by individuals intolerant to lactose or allergic to cow milk. However, rice milk contains As. In this sense, the concentration of As in rice milk should be controlled. In the present study it is proposed a methodology for determination of As(III), dimethylarsenic (DMA), monomethylarsenic (MMA) and As(V) species in rice milk using LC-ICP-MS. The main features of the methodology are fast analysis, easy and simple sample preparation, where the sample is 3-fold diluted in the mobile phase and then filtered. The four arsenic species investigated were detected in the analysed samples, being As(V) the main species. The limit of quantification of the method ranges from 0.25 to 0.43 μg L−1 As. The analyte recovery ranged from 81 to 116% for samples spiked to 1.00 μg L−1 or 5.00 μg L−1 As and the relative standard deviation was better than 5%. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={In a previous study, we investigated the use of shrimp effluents from well water (WW) and diluted seawater (DSW) (both with 2.7 dS m−1 electrical conductivity (EC)), and a hydroponic solution (HS) as the control treatment in greenhouse lettuce production. This new paper completes the previous one by focusing on the quality of lettuce harvested. Compared to the lettuce from the other treatments, WW-lettuce exhibited higher levels of phenolic compounds and a higher antioxidant capacity, mainly in the soluble fraction. The lettuce cultivated with DSW showed no significant difference in total phenolics and flavonoids with respect to the HS lettuce. These results reveal that the functional properties (antioxidant properties, polyphenols and flavonoid content) are even better in the lettuce produced with WW and DSW shrimp effluents. In contrast, agronomical properties (weight, number of leaves and yield) were found to be better in the case of lettuce grown with the hydroponic solution (control). © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Lipid oxidation is a main source of reactive carbonyls, and these compounds have been shown both to degrade amino acids by carbonyl-amine reactions and to produce important food flavors. However, reactive carbonyls are not the only products of the lipid oxidation pathway. Lipid oxidation also produces free radicals. Nevertheless, the contribution of these lipid radicals to the production of food flavors by degradation of amino acid derivatives is mostly unknown. In an attempt to investigate new routes of flavor formation, this study describes the degradation of phenylalanine, phenylpyruvic acid, phenylacetaldehyde, and β-phenylethylamine in the presence of the 13-hydroperoxide of linoleic acid, 4-oxononenal (a reactive carbonyl derived from this hydroperoxide), and the mixture of both of them. The obtained results show the formation of phenylacetic acid and benzaldehyde in these reactions as a consequence of the combined action of carbonyl-amine and free radical reactions for amino acid degradation. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Sugar beet pectin is rich in rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) region, which is a potential source of prebiotics. RG-I pectin cannot be extracted the same way as commercial homogalacturan-rich pectin using hot acid. Therefore, this study has explored several alternative methods, including microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) and conventional-solvent extraction (CSE) at atmospheric pressure using different solvents, and microwave-assisted hydrothermal extraction (MAHE) under pressure using water. No conclusive differences in microwave and conventional heating were found with heating rate controlled. The optimum treatment times of both MAE and CSE at 90 °C atmospheric pressure and regardless of the solvents used were 120 min; however, MAHE at 130 °C under pressure can dramatically reduce the time to 10 min. Alcohol-insoluble solids (AIS) extracted using pH13 solvent by MAE had both the highest RG-I yield at 25.3% and purity at 260.2 mg/g AIS, followed by AIS extracts using water by MAHE with 7.5% and 166.7 mg/g AIS respectively. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Bananas are important staples in tropical and sub-tropical regions and their potential as a source of provitamin A has recently attracted attention for biofortification. A collection of 189 banana genotypes (AAB-plantains, M. acuminata cultivars and bred hybrids) was screened to determine variability in fruit pulp provitamin A carotenoid (pVAC) content using high performance liquid chromatography. Total carotenoid content in tested genotypes varied from 1.45 µg/g for hybrid 25447-S7 R2P8 to 36.21 µg/g for M. acuminata cultivar ITC.0601 Hung Tu with a mean of 8.00 µg/g fresh weight. Predominant carotenoids identified were α-carotene (38.67%), trans-β-carotene (22.08%), lutein (22.08%), 13-cis-β-carotene (14.45%) and 9-cis-β-carotene (2.92%), indicating that about 78% of the carotenoids in bananas are pVAC. High pVAC genotypes were identified for integration into biofortification strategies to combat vitamin A deficiency in developing countries. © 2019},

abstract={In this study, in order to investigate the role of Ca2+ in GABA signal transduction involved in phenolics accumulation in barley seedlings under NaCl stress, the seedlings were treated with exogenous GABA and its synthesis inhibitor, 3-mercaplopropionic acid (3-MP), as well as Ca2+ channel blockers La3+, Ca2+ chelator EGTA, and Ca2+ release channel inhibitor 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB). The results showed that GABA significantly enhanced phenolics, calcium and calmodulin content. It also induced Ca2+ influx in barley root tips cells, and altered the distribution of Ca2+, making calcium precipitates more uniform and intensive. While, 3-MP treatment led to opposite changes, which suggested that GABA was essential for calcium content increase. In addition, accumulation of phenolics was inhibited by LaCl3, EGTA and 2-APB treatments, and this inhibition could be alleviated partly by exogenous GABA. Taken together, Ca2+ was involved in GABA signal transduction for phenolics accumulation in barley seedlings under NaCl stress. © 2019},

abstract={The aim of this study was to quantitatively characterize 19 green and roasted coffee beans by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A total of 57 phenolic acids including nine methyl ester of mono-, di-caffeoylquinic acid, and feruloylquinic acid were identified. The methyl hydroxycinnamoyl quinates are reported for the first time from Coffea arabica and Coffea robusta. The total phenolic content ranged from 5628 ± 227 to 8581 ± 109 mg/100 g dry weight (DW) in green, and from 791 ± 63 to 1891 ± 37 mg/100 g DW roasted beans. The methyl caffeoylquinates accounted for 2.1% of the total phenolic acids. The result suggested that the phenolic composition was affected by the type of species, cultivars, and roasting process. Hence, to retain the balance between health beneficial phenolics and sensory attributes, optimization of roasting condition specific to the cultivar type substantially required. © 2019},

abstract={The physico-elemental profiles of commercially attained and roasted organic coffee beans from Ethiopia, Colombia, Honduras, and Mexico were compared using light microscopy, X-ray micro-computed tomography, and external beam particle induced X-ray emission. External beam PIXE analysis detected P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Br, Rb, and Sr in samples. Linear discriminant analysis showed that there was no strong association between elemental data and production region, whilst a heatmap combined with hierarchical clustering showed that soil-plant physico-chemical properties may influence regional elemental signatures. Physical trait data showed that Mexican coffee beans weighed significantly more than beans from other regions, whilst Honduras beans had the highest width. X-ray micro-computed tomography qualitative data showed heterogeneous microstructural features within and between beans representing different regions. In conclusion, such multi-dimensional analysis may present a promising tool in assessing the nutritional content and qualitative characteristics of food products such as coffee. © 2019 The Authors},

The results showed that only Loc'kás starch had a unimodal granule size distribution, whereas Imilla negra and Imilla blanca starches showed two and three granule size populations, respectively. The starch from Imilla negra showed higher apparent amylose content, peak viscosity, phosphorous content and paste clarity. The starch from Imilla blanca showed high relative crystallinity, while Imilla blanca and Imilla negra had higher intensity ratios than that from Loc'ka, suggesting high molecular order. Cooked starch from Imilla negra showed higher resistant starch (RS) fraction than the other starches studied. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The aim of this study was to examine both physiological and molecular evidences related to fruit discoloration in postharvest strawberries under high ambient temperature. The results showed the total anthocyanin and their main components in the strawberries under 35 °C were greatly increased due to the significant up-regulations of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes and transportation genes. High ambient temperature greatly improved the activities of peroxidase (POD) and enhanced gene expressions of POD3, POD6 and POD63. At the same time, high storage temperature activated laccase genes expression including laccase-9 and laccase-14, which was closely related to anthocyanin degradation. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism were also increased under high ambient temperature at transcript levels. Therefore, we concluded that high ambient temperature could enhance anthocyanin accumulation and degradation at the same time, which maybe the main reasons for the fruits discoloration of postharvest strawberries under high ambient temperature. © 2019},

abstract={Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations vary among headwaters, with variation typically decreasing with watershed area. We hypothesized that streamflow intermittence could be an important source of variation in DOC concentrations across a small watershed, through (a) temporal legacies of drying on organic matter accumulation and biotic communities and (b) spatial patterns of connectivity with DOC sources. To test these hypotheses, we conducted three synoptic water chemistry sampling campaigns across a 25.5-km2 watershed in south-eastern Idaho during early spring, late summer, and late fall. Using changepoint analysis, we found that DOC variability collapsed at a consistent location (watershed areas ~1.3 to ~1.8 km2) across seasons, which coincided with the watershed area where variability in streamflow intermittence collapsed (~1.5 km2). To test hypothesized mechanisms through which intermittence may affect DOC, we developed temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal metrics of streamflow intermittence and related these to DOC concentrations. Streamflow intermittence was a strong predictor of DOC across seasons, but different metrics predicted DOC depending on season. Seasonal changes in the effects of intermittence on DOC reflected seasonal changes from instream to flowpath controls. A metric that captured spatial connectivity to sources significantly predicted DOC during high flows, when DOC is typically controlled by transport. In contrast, a reach-scale temporal metric of intermittence predicted DOC during the late growing season, when DOC is typically controlled by instream processes and when legacy effects of drying (e.g., diminished biological communities) would likely affect DOC. The effects of intermittence on DOC extend beyond temporal legacies at a point. Our results suggest that legacy effects of intermittence do not propagate downstream in this system. Instead, snapshots of spatial patterns of intermittence upstream of a reach are critical for understanding spatial patterns of DOC through connectivity to DOC sources, and these processes drive patterns of DOC even in perennial reaches. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Glass surfaces are of considerable interest due to their disproportionately large influence on the performance of glass articles in many applications. However, the behavior of glass surfaces has proven difficult to model and predict due to their complex structure and interactions with the environment. Here, the effects of glass network topology on the surface reactivity of glasses have been investigated using reactive and nonreactive force field-based molecular dynamics simulations as well as density functional theory. A topological constraint-based description for surface reactivity is developed, allowing for improved understanding of the physical and chemical origins of surface reactivity. Results show evidence for the existence of a chemically stable intermediate phase on the surface of the glass where the glass network is mechanically isostatic.

abstract={Luminescence measurements of CsCdF3:Mn reveal material properties suitable for UV and X-ray sensing. Mn2+ substitutes for Cd2+ with octahedral crystal field parameters 10Dq = 7020 ± 120 cm-1 and B = 773 ± 13 cm-1. UV stimulation at 250 nm results in intense Mn2+ emission and also in the production of F-centers and additional defects. Continuous 250 nm stimulation charges the material, enhancing the Mn2+ emission intensity over time due to the filling of shallow traps that contribute to persistent luminescence. When the stimulation is ceased, Mn2+ emission is observed as an afterglow. F-centers give rise to optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) that is temporally stable and can be stimulated at wavelengths near 300 nm. We propose a model that describes these effects, where UV stimulation results in electron transfer from Mn2+ to the conduction band and subsequent electron trapping in various defect states. X-ray stimulation produces Mn2+ radioluminescence that varies in intensity by 0.004%/Gy after a 300 Gy priming dose. The X-ray irradiation also produces OSL-active F-centers and the defects that cause the afterglow. Thermoluminescence measurements reveal low-temperature peaks that are correlated with the afterglow and high-temperature peaks that are correlated with the OSL, after both X-ray and UV irradiations. The luminescence of Mn2+ in CsCdF3:Mn may be useful for radiation sensing, where the real-time changes in Mn2+ emission under X-ray and UV stimulation allow for real-time dose measurements, and the OSL induced by each irradiation allows for retrospective dose monitoring. © 2019 Author(s).},

abstract={The Ordos Block is located in the northern part of the North China Craton and its interior is highly stable. A series of fault basins and faults has developed around the periphery, and seismic activity is frequent. To research the dynamic mechanisms that caused the special geomorphology and geological features of the Ordos Block further, this study processed data from two nearly orthogonal profiles laid out in this area and obtained the P-wave velocity structure characteristics of the area. The results showed that the crust–mantle velocity structure, interface depth, and the relationship with the peripheral regions obtained from the two profiles are rather complex: the internal crust structure of the Ordos Block is relatively simple, the low-velocity layer is not developed, the interface does not undulate much, and the crust thickness of the Ordos Block is about 42.0 km. These results show that the Ordos Block is part of a sinking residual feature of the ancient stable continental lithosphere. The crust–mantle structure of the block and its peripheral coupled region shows complex crustal structure features. The velocity structure is abnormally disordered and the interface shows declining or depressed anomalies, revealing the background characteristics of the active structure of the block and the periphery. Another major feature is that the velocity of the Pn wave at the uppermost mantle near the intersection of the two profiles has directional and anisotropic features, i.e., the value of the velocity in the east–west direction is significantly greater than that in the north–south direction and the difference is 0.25 km/s. The reason for this phenomenon may be that since the Mesozoic Era the Ordos Block has been mainly subject to east–west compressive stress, forming a series of north–south structural deformations. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={We applied apatite fission-track (AFT) thermochronometry to the Cretaceous-Paleogene granitic rocks across the southern part of the Northeast (NE) Japan Arc in order to elucidate the denudation history. As the results, AFT ages were estimated at 79.5–66.0 Ma on the fore-arc side, 29.8–5.5 Ma in the Ou Backbone range (OBR) and 19.1–4.6 Ma on the back-arc side. Thermal inverse modeling with HeFTy offered high-resolution thermal histories, which were converted into denudation rates under the assumption of appropriate geothermal gradients. On the fore-arc side, stable and slow denudation setting (denudation rates < 0.05 mm/yr) was deduced through the Paleogene. On the contrary, in the OBR and on back-arc side, rapid denudation rates from 1 to a few mm/yr were estimated at some localities reflecting the uplift event after 3–2 Ma. Besides, the uplifting style of OBR was constrained from the thermochronometric data; the doming uplift is more plausible than the tilted pop-up style, which was previously suggested based on geological observations. The Iide and Asahi mountains on the back-arc side probably have started to uplift at 3–1 Ma, coeval with the uplift of the OBR. This observation disagrees with the previous tectonic models in which the deformation on the back-arc side initiated at 5–3.5 Ma, prior to the deformation in the OBR. This disagreement possibly suggests a heterogenous tectonic history on the back-arc side. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Eocene shallow-water limestone is widespread in small isolated outcrops in Timor. Several occurrences of limestone in the Culocau River of Timor-Leste are significant because they lie within the type locality of the mainly volcanic Barique Formation. The tectonostratigraphic affinity of the Culocau River limestone is investigated by establishing the range of microfacies present (indicative of the inner neritic zone less than 40 m deep to the outer neritic Deep Euphotic Zone), the age of the limestone using planktonic and benthic foraminifers (late Middle Eocene, probably within the 37.8–43.6 Ma interval), and the similarity of the limestone–volcanic association to coeval occurrences elsewhere in Timor and the region. The field association of Middle Eocene neritic limestone with volcanic-volcaniclastic rocks is widespread in Timor, but is not known along the North West Shelf of Australia. Elsewhere in Timor the association of rocks found at the Barique Formation type locality also includes Late Eocene and latest Oligocene-earliest Miocene neritic limestone. This young, mainly volcanic association (Barique Group) is usually found in coherent areas of outcrop with the Late Mesozoic Palelo Group, oceanic facies (radiolarites to carbonate pelagites), Early Jurassic Bahaman-like carbonate-bank deposits (Perdido Group) and associated units of Gondwanan origin that form some high fatus surrounded by the Barique Group, and the Lolotoi/Mutis Metamorphic Complex. This is the Overthrust Terrane Association that is distinct in outcrop area and in lithostratigraphic makeup from the pre-collision Late Carboniferous to Middle Jurassic East Gondwana Interior Rift Association and the Late Jurassic to early Late Miocene Timor-Scott Plateau Association. The Cretaceous to Early Miocene units of the Overthrust Terrane Association, including the Barique Group, are similar to coeval units in Sumba and are considered to be fragments of the fore-arc of the Banda Arc. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={The Masara Gold District in Eastern Mindanao, Philippines, is one of the most prolific gold provinces in the Philippines. Recent district-scale mineral exploration makes it possible to undertake geologic and geochemical studies and thus to yield better insights about the mineralization environment of the Masara Gold District. In the Masara Gold District, mineralization is hosted in andesitic rocks and multiple stocks of diorite intrusions. New U-Pb and whole rock K-Ar age dating of these host rocks reveal Eocene to Plio-Pleistocene ages for the magmatic suites. A new lithologic unit is proposed to accommodate the composite diorite phases associated with mineralization. Major and trace element geochemistry of these host rocks show that the Eocene magmatic suite exhibits a tholeiitic character while the diorite and subvolcanic andesite pulses of the Miocene are calc-alkaline in composition. Adakitic rocks were emplaced during the Late Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene. Mineralization in eastern Mindanao is associated with several intrusive events formed during the Oligocene to the Pliocene. The majority of these mineralization events is associated with calc-alkaline magmatic suites. Based on this study, epithermal gold mineralization in the Masara Gold District is closely related to the Late Miocene magmatic rocks which exhibit calc-alkaline and adakitic signatures. © 2019 The Author(s)},

The ratio of Os isotopes in seawater, in particular, is of wide interest as a source of insight into notable geologic events such as oceanic anoxic events, rapid global warming episodes, and eruption of large igneous provinces, but marine Os isotope records from before 80 Ma are scarce. We present a record of secular variations of marine Os isotope ratios from a thick, continuous succession of Middle and Upper Triassic pelagic chert in the Sakahogi section of the Mino Belt accretionary complex. Initial Os isotope ratios (187Os/188Os) have a wide range in this succession, from 0.197 to 0.813. The variations in this Os record are quite similar to those in the marine Sr isotope record for the same time period, although their amplitudes differ owing to the differing residence times of Os and Sr in the ocean. Together, our results and previous data trace a continuous Os isotope record for ca. 50 Myr starting in Anisian time. We document the following six notable features in the Os record, which also appear in the Sr record, and their interpretation: (1) a negative (unradiogenic) shift associated with euxinia in the latest Anisian reflecting late-stage Siberian Traps eruptions, (2) wide fluctuations from the latest Anisian to Ladinian induced by volcanism and by the late Ladinian humid pulse and volcanism of the Italian Volcanic Center, (3) a continuous decrease in the early Carnian during eruptions of the Wrangellia large igneous province, (4) stable unradiogenic values from the early to early middle Norian associated with a prolonged arid period, (5) a negative spike in the middle Norian associated with the Manicouagan impact event, and (6) a broad rise and fall from the earliest late Norian to the Rhaetian ages, attributed to the Cimmerian-Indosinian orogeny and subsequent volcanism of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={Anhydrous, medium/coarse-grained spinel bearing mantle xenoliths from the Subei Basin, Eastern China have mineral arrangements that reflect low energy geometry. Because of clinopyroxene modal contents, they are grouped into cpx-rich lherzolites (cpx ≥ 14percentage), lherzolites (8 &lt; cpx &lt; 14%), cpx-poor lherzolites (6 &lt; cpx ≤ 8%) and harzburgites (cpx up to 4%), without relevant textural differences from the most fertile to the most depleted lithotypes. The cpx-rich lherzolites have mineral chemistry close in composition to Primitive Mantle (PM), whereas cpx-poor lherzolite (and lherzolite) and harzburgite groups cannot be considered as a result of direct melting of the PM source. In addition, the high LREE, Th and U contents, coupled with a Sr enrichment of clinopyroxenes in these lithotypes, indicate the circulation of a silicate melt (with crustal components) in a variably depleted mantle sector well before the entrapment of the xenoliths by the host basalt. Despite the large differences in refractory lithophile element contents (i.e. Ca, Al and REE), the equilibrium temperatures never exceed 1021 °C with a constant difference (&lt;200 °C) from harzburgites to cpx-rich lherzolites. Measured mineral water contents indicate that the whole rock contains, on average, 19 ± 7 ppm of H2O without any systematic variation among rock types nor correlation with Al2O3, light-REE and Yb (or Y) contents of cpx. The cpx H2O contents of cpx-rich lherzolites (41–96 ppm) are, on average, one order of magnitude lower than those theoretically expected (214–530 ppm) for a residuum after a maximum of 3% of PM fractional (≈ bulk) melting in the spinel stability field. The proposed dehydration model suggests that the cold highly refractory harzburgites and cpx-poor lherzolites (and lherzolites?) may represent old cratonic lithospheric mantle modified at depth by the interaction with silicate melts, which may also have involved crustal components. In turn, cpx-rich lherzolites constitute fragments of upwelling fertile asthenosphere, which caused the removal/erosion of the lowermost part of the lithospheric mantle. This asthenosphere portion may have been incorporated in the lithospheric region since the Jurassic and it may have progressively cooled down after one (or more) partial melting episodes. The water depletion can be accounted for a continuous loss by diffusion during the subsolidus chemical-physical readjustment, well after (&gt;5My, based on modelled H2O solid-solid diffusion rate) the occurrence of the last melting episode. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={The conversion of existing energy systems to intelligent integrated energy systems can happen only if economic benefits due to introduction of the intelligent integrated energy systems will exceed required level of investments. Thus, it is necessary for every optimal design energy systems problem according to the purposes of the study to determine various aspects of equipment configuration, investment and a proposed unit commitment on a case-by-case basis. The studies, taking under consideration energy efficiency of renewable energy units, are particularly important as environmental safety standards are increasing. In the paper optimal design of prosumer energy supply system problem in the intelligent integrated energy system was investigated. For this purpose a super structure for an energy supply system includes different generating capacities with relevant power range. The superstructure for prosumer energy supply system consists of an electric boiler, a gas-fired boiler, a solar photo-voltaic, a solar heating system and a gas-fired CHP. An ability of district energy system to receive the excess generating energy is restricted by the constraints. The heat and electricity tariffs and the received to district energy supply system energy constraints are varying according to time period. As a result of this study, cost-effectiveness analysis of chosen equipment configuration was undertaken. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.},

abstract={Background: Numerous studies have demonstrated that DNA methylation levels in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) gene measured in cord blood are significantly associated with prenatal tobacco smoke exposure and can be used as a fetal exposure biomarker. The mechanism driving this demethylation has not been determined and it is unclear if all cord blood cell types are impacted. Nucleated red blood cells (nRBCs/CD235a+ cells) are developmentally immature RBCs that display genome-wide hypomethylation and are observed at increased frequency in the cord blood of smoking mothers. We tested if AHRR methylation levels in CD235a+ nRBCs or nRBC counts influenced AHRR methylation in whole cord blood. Methods: Cord blood was collected from smoking (n = 34) and nonsmoking (n = 19) mothers and DNA was prepared from whole cord blood, isolated CD235a+ nRBCs, and CD14+ monocytes. AHRR methylation in cord blood DNA was measured using Illumina 850K arrays (cg05575921, chr5:373378). Pyrosequencing was used to compare methylation levels among cord blood, CD235a+, and CD14+ cells. We measured nRBC percentages using conventional complete blood counts and estimated percent nRBCs by a deconvolution model. Results: Methylation levels in AHRR were significantly lower in nRBCs relative to whole cord blood and CD14+ monocytes. While AHRR methylation levels in the cell types were significantly correlated across all subjects, methylation values at the chr5:373378 CpG averaged 14.6% lower in nRBCs (range 0.4 to 24.8%; p = 3.8E-13) relative to CD14+, with nonsmokers showing a significantly greater hypomethylation (- 4.1%, p = 1.8E-02). Methylation level at the AHRR chr5:373378 CpG was strongly associated with self-reported smoking in both CD14+ monocytes (t test p = 5.7E-09) and nRBCs (p = 4.8E-08), as well as cotinine levels (regression p = 1.1E-07 and p = 3.6E-04, respectively). For subjects with whole blood 850K data, robust linear regression models adjusting for estimated cell type composition, either including nRBCs counts or estimates, modestly increased the association between smoking and cg05575921 methylation. Conclusions: Prenatal smoke exposure was highly significantly associated with AHRR methylation in cord blood, CD14+ monocytes, and CD235a+ nRBCs. AHRR methylation levels in nRBCs and nRBC counts had minimal effect on cord blood methylation measurements. However, regression models using estimated nRBCs or actual nRBC counts outperformed those lacking these covariates. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={Diesel-powered road vehicles are important sources for nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, and the European passenger fleet is highly dieselised, which has resulted in many European roadside environments being noncompliant with legal air quality standards for nitrogen dioxide (NO2). On the basis of vehicle emission remote sensing data for 300000 light-duty vehicles across the United Kingdom, light-duty diesel NOx emissions were found to be highly dependent on ambient temperature with low temperatures resulting in higher NOx emissions, i.e., a "low temperature NOx emission penalty" was identified. This feature was not observed for gasoline-powered vehicles. Older Euro 3 to 5 diesel vehicles emitted NOx similarly, but vehicles compliant with the latest Euro 6 emission standard emitted less NOx than older vehicles and demonstrated less of an ambient temperature dependence. This ambient temperature dependence is overlooked in current emission inventories but is of importance from an air quality perspective. Owing to Europe's climate, a predicted average of 38% more NOx emissions have burdened Europe when compared to temperatures encountered in laboratory test cycles. However, owing to the progressive elimination of vehicles demonstrating the most severe low temperature NOx penalty, light-duty diesel NOx emissions are likely to decrease more rapidly throughout Europe than currently thought. © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Introduction: Influenza vaccination is regarded as the most effective way to prevent influenza infection. Due to the rapid genetic changes that influenza viruses undergo, seasonal influenza vaccines must be reformulated and re-administered annually necessitating the evaluation of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) each year. The estimation of influenza VE presents numerous challenges. Areas Covered: This review aims to identify, discuss, and, where possible, offer suggestions for dealing with the following challenges in estimating influenza VE: different outcomes of interest against which VE is estimated, study designs used to assess VE, sources of bias and confounding, repeat vaccination, waning immunity, population level effects of vaccination, and VE in at-risk populations. Expert Opinion: The estimation of influenza VE has improved with surveillance networks, better understanding of sources of bias and confounding, and the implementation of advanced statistical methods. Future research should focus on better estimates of the indirect effects of vaccination, the biological effects of vaccination, and how vaccines interact with the immune system. Specifically, little is known about how influenza vaccination impacts an individual’s infectiousness, how vaccines wane over time, and the impact of repeated vaccination. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Introduction: COPD and lung cancer are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and they share a common environmental risk factor in cigarette smoke exposure and a genetic predisposition represented by their incidence in only a fraction of smokers. This reflects the ability of cigarette smoke to induce an inflammatory response in the airways of susceptible smokers. Moreover, COPD could be a driving factor in lung cancer, by increasing oxidative stress and the resulting DNA damage and repression of the DNA repair mechanisms, chronic exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines, repression of innate immunity and increased cellular proliferation. Areas covered: We have focused our review on the potential pathogenic molecular links between tobacco smoking-related COPD and lung cancer and the potential molecular targets for new drug development by understanding the common signaling pathways involved in COPD and lung cancer. Expert commentary: Research in this field is mostly limited to animal models or small clinical trials. Large clinical trials are needed but mostly combined models of COPD and lung cancer are necessary to investigate the processes caused by chronic inflammation, including genetic and epigenetic alteration, and the expression of inflammatory mediators that link COPD and lung cancer, to identify new molecular therapeutic targets. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The objective of this work is the investigation of a novel refrigeration cycle which utilizes both electricity and heat input. This hybrid cycle compresses the refrigerant by using a conventional compressor in the low-pressure stage and a novel isochoric compression in the high-pressure stage by adding heat in the system. Between the compression devices, there is an intercooler which is vital for reducing the heat input demand. The isochoric process is performed in a closed vessel where refrigerant pressure increases by adding heat, according to the gas laws. Different working fluids are studies like CO 2 , R134a, R404A, R152a, R290 and R32. According to the final results, the electricity consumption is reduced by the incorporation of the partial thermal compression compared to the conventional system with only mechanical compression. The CO 2 and the R32 seem to be the most promising refrigerants for utilization in the novel suggested cycles. For the case with 75% mechanical compression and 25% thermal compression, the electricity savings with CO 2 are found 15.61% for the case with the evaporating temperature at −25 °C and the heat rejection temperature at 35 °C. More specifically, in this scenario for 100 kW refrigeration production there is a need for 47.29 kW electricity and 19.72 kW heat input, while the system COP is 1.492 and the exergy efficiency 41.01%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We present a simulation code which can solve a broad range of partial differential equations in a full sphere. The code expands tensorial variables in a spectral series of spin-weighted spherical harmonics in the angular directions and a scaled Jacobi polynomial basis in the radial direction, as described in Vasil et al. (2018; hereafter, Part-I). Nonlinear terms are calculated by transforming from the coefficients of the spectral series to the value of each quantity on the physical grid, where it is easy to calculate products and perform other local operations. The expansion makes it straightforward to solve equations in tensor form (i.e., without decomposition into scalars). We propose and study several unit tests which demonstrate the code can accurately solve linear problems, implement boundary conditions, and transform between spectral and physical space. We then run a series of benchmark problems proposed in Marti et al. (2014), implementing the hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic equations. We are able to calculate more accurate solutions than reported in Marti et al. (2014) by running at higher spatial resolution and using a higher-order timestepping scheme. We find the rotating convection and convective dynamo benchmark problems depend sensitively on details of timestepping and data analysis. We also demonstrate that in low resolution simulations of the dynamo problem, small changes in a numerical scheme can lead to large changes in the solution. To aid future comparison to these benchmarks, we include the source code used to generate the data, as well as the data and analysis scripts used to generate the figures. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={The elastic response of glass is one of its most important properties for a wide range of applications in architecture, transportation, information display, and healthcare. Unfortunately, there is currently no model to predict quantitatively accurate values of elastic moduli from the underlying network topology of the glass. Here we introduce a topological model to calculate the Young's modulus of glass in terms of the free energy density of rigid constraints in the network. The model shows quantitatively accurate agreement with glasses across a variety of compositional families. More remarkably, the variation of modulus with temperature can also be predicted by accounting for the temperature dependence of the constraints, including the approach to the viscoelastic region near the glass transition. © 2019},

abstract={Neutron and X-ray diffraction experiments with large ranges of scattering vector, up to Q max of 400 nm −1 and 250 nm −1 , respectively, were performed on (SnO) x (P 2 O 5 ) 1-x glasses with 0.5 ≤ x ≤ 0.7, and the structural parameters of the P[sbnd]O and Sn[sbnd]O polyhedra were determined. The fraction of P–NBO (non-bridging oxygen) bonds increases systematically at the expense of the P–BO (bridging oxygen) bonds with SnO additions. The Sn[sbnd]O coordination number decreases in a predictable way from four at the metaphosphate composition (x = 0.5) to about three at the diphosphate composition (x = 0.67). The structural units are assumed to be SnO 4 trigonal bipyramids and SnO 3 trigonal pyramids with the lone-pair of Sn(II) electrons occupying one of the corners, similar to those in related crystal structures. For all glasses up to x = 0.67, the SnO z pyramids and PO 4 tetrahedra form a continuous network with P[sbnd]O[sbnd]P and P[sbnd]O[sbnd]Sn bonds and the Sn[sbnd]O polyhedra do not share oxygen neighbors. From comparisons of the compositional dependences of the Sn[sbnd]O and Zn[sbnd]O coordination numbers and the respective number densities of atoms in the binary tin and zinc phosphate glasses, it is presumed that the Sn[sbnd]O coordination increases further with N SnO &gt; 4 in the ultraphosphate range (x &lt; 0.5). © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Evidence of stress corrosion cracking has been observed in exposed semi-stationary bobbin tool friction stir welded aluminum-copper-lithium alloy 2060-T8. Microstructural analysis confirmed the heterogeneous microstructure transformation caused by the thermomechanical impact of the welding process. Grain boundary phase accumulation initiated anodic dissolution in NaCl solution under stress. In the center and the heat affected zone of the weld, the microstructure was found to form overaged and high copper containing equilibrium phases promoting intergranular stress corrosion. © 2019},

abstract={In this work, we present a novel optical biosensor based on periodically alternated layers of SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles grown by wet methods and working as a Bragg mirror in a label free format. The sensing principle relies on the change of the optical response generated by variations in the dielectric constant of the voids due to a biorecognition probe-target event. This change is reflected in a modification in the photonic band gap frequencies of the Bragg reflector. As a proof of concept, biotin and streptavidin biorecognition on the biosensor surface is monitored in label free format, achieving a LOD of 3.09 mg L−1 (54 nM) for the determination of streptavidin. Our proposed biosensor also shows selective determination against a variety of targets (horseradish peroxidase and bovine serum albumin antibody) working in physiological conditions (diluted human serum). To get a picture of the potential of our development and its ease of integration, we incorporated the immunosensor in an electronic consumable technology, such as compact disk, using the optical disk as analytical platform and a CD player detector for the determination of streptavidin. Thus, our findings point out the feasibility of nanoparticle based Bragg reflectors in the biosensing field and open new avenues towards the rational design of a new generation of versatile, easy to fabricate in mass scale and cost-competitive biosensors. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={This article explores a new, highly scalable bioreactor design for photosynthetic, lipid producing organisms. Microalgae are important to the recovery of resources from wastewater and microalgae derived oils have the potential to become an important source of transportation fuels, but current photobioreactor designs are not readily scalable. In contrast, this article evaluates the productivity of periodic designs that use repeated unit cells defined by fluid dynamically driven recirculation profiles so that scaleup may be achieved simply by increasing (massively) the number of unit cells. Photobioreactors with one, seven, and nineteen unit cells were constructed containing 13.2, 92.4, and 251 gal, respectively, to demonstrate scalability. Development of a kinetic growth model accounting for variations in photointensity versus depth predicts approximately linear (instead of exponential) growth as observed in the first week of productivity. This design decreases the required power per volume by over 50% compared to paddlewheel designs, and material costs per unit cell decrease with increasing reactor size, because flow symmetry defines the boundaries of the unit cells in the absence of internal material walls. These results provide a more efficient path to scale up to commercially relevant acreage, bringing algal biofuels closer to energy parity. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={A germination trial was conducted to screen effects of plant growth regulators (PGRs) on 9 Alberta native grass and forb species with the aim of identifying PGRs with the capacity to improve seed germination and early plant development in disturbed and reconstructed soil conditions. Seeds were treated with 500 mg/L of various gibberellins (GA3_40 [40% GA3], GA3_90 [90% GA3], and GA4/7), 5 mg/L cytokinin (kinetin), and 0.1 mg/L brassinosteroids (brassinolide). Experiments were conducted in a growth chamber following a 24 h soaking period. PGR seed treatment did not significantly increase percent (%) germination for the majority of species, but rather assisted in breaking seed dormancy and enhancing early radical emergence. Early germination at day 7 was measured for Fragaria virginiana (130–150% increase over the control for GA3_40, GA3_90, GA4/7, and brassinolide), Koeleria macrantha (36% increase for GA3 40), Poa palustris (98–123% increase for all PGRs), Agrostis scabra (42–56% increase for all PGRs) and Festuca hallii (85–93% increase for kinetin and brassinolide). Gibberellin treatments were significantly more effective in improving shoot growth; kinetin and brassinolide were significantly more effective in enhancing root development for the majority of tested plant species. PGRs having the greatest overall impact on seed germination and plant development, as measured by vigor index were brassinolide and GA4/7. Tested PGRs have the potential to benefit native grass and forb restoration and revegetation efforts, improving the efficacy of planting prescriptions, with the aim of increasing early ground cover, stabilizing soils, enhancing biodiversity, and reducing the time to reclamation certification. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Microbiome profiling holds great promise for the development of novel disease biomarkers and therapeutics. Next-generation sequencing is currently the preferred method for microbiome data collection and multiple standardized tools, packages, and pipelines have been developed for the purpose of raw data processing and microbial annotation. However, these currently available pipelines come with entry-level barriers such as high-performance hardware, software installation, and sequential command-line scripting that often deter end-users. We thus created Cloud Computing for Microbiome Profiling (CCMP, https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__ccmp.usc.edu&d=DwIGaQ&c=sJ6xIWYx-zLMB3EPkvcnVg&r=hPRQO-QHqXhD8p9F43Mezw&m=5Ygbn-ChjRk5z0uQS3lymjWAtJDFin15cLna7hnk9fc&s=oZtYVQTTauavKclhmxLiALxU3h4yWltlEXa0Lz3mC8U&e= ), a public cloud-based web tool which combines the analytical power of current microbiome analysis platforms with a user-friendly interface. CCMP is a free-of-charge software-as-a-service (SaaS) that simplifies user experience by enabling users to complete their analysis in a single step, uploading raw sequencing data files. Once users upload 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence data, our pipeline performs taxonomic annotation, abundance profiling, and statistical tests to report microbiota signatures altered by diseases or experimental conditions. CCMP took a 125 gigabyte (GB) input of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence data from 1052 specimens in FASTQ format and reported figures and tables of taxonomic annotations, statistical tests, α and β diversity calculations, and principal coordinate analyses within 21 h. CCMP is the first fully-automated web interface that integrates three key solutions for large-scale data analysis: cloud computing, fast file transfer technology, and microbiome analysis tools. As a reliable platform that supplies consistent microbiome analysis, CCMP will advance microbiome research by making effortful bioinformatics easily accessible to public. © 2019},

abstract={This paper reports a procedure of building a functionalized reduced graphene oxide (rGO) library and an electronic nose based on the library. Functionalized rGO was prepared by reducing and modifying graphene oxide (GO) with chemically diverse amine ligands. We used the unmodified rGO and eight different functionalized rGO to build the chemiresistive sensor arrays in the electronic nose. Four potential cancer-related biomarkers in breath, ethanol, 2-ethylhexanol, nonanal and ethylbenzene, were used as the model volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analytes. The electronic nose showed linear responses to the model VOCs with high sensitivity of 25 ppm. Principal component analysis (PCA) results demonstrated the successful discrimination of the four model VOCs and binary VOC mixtures. The procedure of building the rGO library was simple and yielded consistent performance. We expected more versatile and sensitive electronic noses to be constructed based on the functionalized rGO library with potential applications in recognition and quantitative measurement of VOCs for health monitoring and disease diagnosis. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={In the past years, the demand for small batches of clinical grade plasmid DNA has been growing. For that purpose, we designed and qualified a scaled-down Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) production method, able to produce small batches (1-4 mg) of plasmid. The developed method does not require any complex production equipment and utilizes only disposable production materials, which makes it easy to implement and simplifies line-clearance. We have successfully used this method to produce several small batches of two different plasmids. The produced plasmids, both formulated in an Electroporation Buffer, are mixed and filled into small, single-use, aliquots. Quality control confirmed the robustness of the developed method and a stability study showed that the final formulation is stable for at least two years. The final patient formulation will be subsequently used in a phase I/II clinical trial in which retina cells of patients with Age Related Macular Degeneration, are transfected. The presented production method can be generically used for other plasmid constructs and final formulation designs. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Ecological wastewater treatment systems that incorporate aquatic plants (like duckweed) have the potential to recover nutrients and produce high-quality protein, simultaneously alleviating two global issues: hunger and lack of sanitation. Although protein production by duckweed in simple lagoon systems and laboratory trials has been reported, its physiology throughout more complex wastewater treatment systems containing a range of different environmental conditions has not been examined. In this study, a duckweed co-culture (Lemna japonica/minor and Wolffia columbiana) was grown on wastewater from four different stages of a pilot-scale ecological treatment system. Contrary to the literature, the protein content of duckweed did not consistently increase with increasing aqueous nitrogen concentrations, but rather appeared to also be dependent on chemical and microbial interactions. This study indicates that with proper management, duckweed grown in ecological wastewater systems can sustainably produce protein at rates exceeding those of common land-grown forage crops (10.1 ton ha−1 yr−1). © 2019 The Authors},

The spectrally varying absorption coefficient is treated in a narrow-band fashion with a correlated-k distribution. The implementation is verified with analytical solutions and validated with results from literature and line-by-line Monte Carlo computations. The method is implemented on GPU with a thorough attention to memory transfer and computational efficiency. The bottlenecks that dominate the computational expenses are addressed, and several techniques are proposed to optimize the GPU execution.

abstract={DNA sequencing witnessed significant research efforts to improve its efficiency and to reduce the production cost. Successful DNA sequencing of quick and low cost techniques associate with the personalized medicine as well as procedures and the different genetics subfields of applications. In this article, a novel two-terminal z-shaped sensor is developed and studied to detect the sequence of DNA nucleobases. The z-shaped sensor consists of two metallic zigzag graphene nanoribbon (ZGNR), a semiconducting channel made of armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR), and a nanopore in the middle of the channel through which DNA nucleobases are translocated. First-principle modeling and non-equilibrium Green's function along with density functional theory (NEGF + DFT), are utilized to investigate the developed device. Various electronic characteristics are investigated, including transmission spectrum, conductance, and electrical current of DNA nucleobases inside the graphene sensors' nanopore. In particular, these properties are studied with variation of nucleobase orientation. The developed sensor resulted in unique signatures for the individual four DNA nucleobases placed within the nanopore. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Since extremely high quench rates (10 12 to 10 14 K/s) are normally necessary to form elemental metallic glasses, very few are known. Even when synthesized, very little is known about their properties because of the limited quantities of material produced under such extreme conditions. In particular, the glass transition temperature, T g , of most of the elemental glasses are unknown. Here, predictions of T g for many elemental metals are made based on the properties of the liquids. The basis for these predictions comes from a number of recently observed correlations in metallic alloy liquids between the liquid fragility, thermal expansion coefficient, rate of change of liquid structure with temperature, and cohesive energy. Using those quantitative correlations and the properties of elemental liquids, T g ′ s for several metallic elements are predicted. Where experimental data are available, they are in reasonable agreement with these predictions. © 2019},

abstract={In this paper, we develop sparse grid discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes for the Vlasov-Maxwell (VM) equations. The VM system is a fundamental kinetic model in plasma physics, and its numerical computations are quite demanding, due to its intrinsic high-dimensionality and the need to retain many properties of the physical solutions. To break the curse of dimensionality, we consider the sparse grid DG methods that were recently developed in [20,21] for transport equations. Such methods are based on multiwavelets on tensorized nested grids and can significantly reduce the numbers of degrees of freedom. We formulate two versions of the schemes: sparse grid DG and adaptive sparse grid DG methods for the VM system. Their key properties and implementation details are discussed. Accuracy and robustness are demonstrated by numerical tests, with emphasis on comparison of the performance of the two methods, as well as with their full grid counterparts. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Existing oil leakage detection approaches on the ocean or on the land have suffered from shortcomings like low-sensitivity, environment-vulnerability and high cost and energy consumption. A unique simple-structured upward open-channel microbial fuel cell (UOC-MFC) was developed to solve these challenges, in which the open-channel rolled cathode vertically floated on the electrolyte solution surface and simultaneously contacted with both air and water. Oil presence covered the cathode surface, blocked the oxygen diffusion on the cathode and thus caused the prompt drop of the potential readings of the UOC-MFC sensors. The oil shock tests using engine oil (EO) showed that the potential decrease and the response time exhibited excellent linear relationships (R2 &gt; 0.99) with the EO amount, indicating a good sensitivity. Due to the separation of the anode and the invading oil, the UOC-MFC sensor recovered its external potential within 2.3 h after the EO shock tests, indicating a good reusability. The power density of the UOC-MFC was 450 mW/m3 under normal condition and dropped to 207 mW/m3 after EO shock due to the internal resistance increasing from 1.29 to 3.80 kΩ. The UOC-MFC integrated with a power management system (PMS) theoretically supported a voltage meter and data transmitter. This study well demonstrated the great potential of the UOC-MFC for in-situ detecting oil presence in a real-time self-sustained mode. © 2019},

abstract={Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA)proteins accumulate in the late stage of plant seed development, and are upregulated in most plants during drought, cold, heat, or salinity stress. LEA proteins can be classified by amino-acid sequence into seven groups. Dehydrins belong to LEA protein group II. In previous studies, the maize KS type dehydrin ZmDHN13 increased the tolerance of transgenic tobacco to oxidative stress. In the present study, ZmDHN13 was identified under copper stress conditions, and the protein was then characterized using transgenic yeast and tobacco plants to investigate its functions. ZmDHN13 bound Cu2+. Its overexpression in transgenic tobacco conferred tolerance to copper stress by binding metals and reducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Three conserved domains displayed a cooperative effect under copper stress conditions. © 2019},

abstract={Drug manufacturing processes must consistently deliver safe and effective product. A key part of achieving this is process validation utilizing Quality by Design (QbD)principles. To meet process validation requirements, process characterization (PC)studies are often performed to expand process understanding and establish an appropriate control strategy that enables the manufacturing process to consistently deliver a target product profile. Two key elements of the control strategy resulting from PC work are a list of critical process parameters (CPPs)and defined operating ranges (ORs). These are frequently derived based on mathematical models describing the relationship between process parameters and critical quality attributes (CQAs). Risk assessment and design of experiments (DOE)techniques are effectively deployed in the industry to identify parameters to study and build process understanding. However, traditional data analysis techniques do not fully utilize the data produced by these studies. In particular, stepwise regression algorithms based on p-values are prone to generate false positives and overfit data, potentially leading to unnecessarily complex control strategies. Many of the deficiencies of traditional stepwise regression can be alleviated by applying cross validation to stepwise regression algorithms, as well as Monte Carlo simulations to estimate model accuracy and predict CQA distributions. These methods can greatly enhance process understanding and assist in the selection of CPPs. A series of PC studies were performed in bioreactors to evaluate a process to produce a recombinant monoclonal antibody. The studies examined process parameters such as dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, inoculation density, as well as cell density at two key process steps. The resulting data were analyzed using several Monte Carlo based methods. First, cross validation was used to determine model size and select parameters to be included in the model. Next, Monte Carlo cross validation was used to compare the accuracy of different models. Finally, simulated CQA profiles were generated to validate proposed ORs. This workflow provides greater process understanding based on a given PC data set and provides higher statistical confidence in both CPP selection and establishment of a control strategy. © 2019 Gilead Sciences, Inc},

abstract={Developing a turbulence model that is computationally inexpensive and compatible with the nature of the numerical scheme is a crucial step in expanding the application of spectral element methods for large eddy simulation (LES) in complex geometries. In this paper, an element-level modal low-pass explicit filtering procedure, which operates in the spectral space, is implemented in a discontinuous spectral element method (DSEM). The application of the modal filter is studied for LES without a subgrid-scale (SGS) model. The method is tested for a configuration featuring isotropic turbulence, and its performance is compared with a previously used method—a spectral interpolation-based nodal filter. The modal filter shows superior performance over the nodal filter. The filtering procedure is then applied to a turbulent channel flow at a friction Reynolds number of Reτ=544, and the results are compared with a previous direct numerical simulation (DNS). It is also shown that the filter strength that provides the best comparison with DNS depends only on the polynomial order and is not a function of the grid resolution. An anisotropic version of the modal filter, which damps high-frequency modes in a specific direction, is also introduced and tested for the channel flow. It is observed that filtering in the spanwise direction is the most effective approach based on the comparison of velocity mean and fluctuations with DNS. In general, the modal filter has shown good performance for both isotropic and wall-bounded flows; the calculated channel friction Reynolds number for the modal filter is within 0.26% error with respect to the DNS data, compared to 5.8% error for a case with no filtering. © 2019},

abstract={Hydroxy fatty acids and carbonyl fatty acids are important multi-functional materials for the manufacture of fragrances and other fine chemicals. In this study, a novel oleate hydratase (PaOH) was cloned from Paracoccus aminophilus DSM 8538 and solubly expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant PaOH efficiently catalyzed the hydration of oleic acid, with a specific activity of 5.21 U mg−1 protein. Enzymatic hydration of oleic acid was optimized for the production of 10-hydroxystearic acid. Under the optimal conditions, a pilot reaction was performed on a 1-L scale, where 90 g L−1 of oleic acid was converted into 10-hydroxystearic acid by 10 g L−1 of lyophilized enzyme within 4 h, achieving a conversion of 96.1% and a space-time yield of up to 552 g L−1 d−1. The resultant 10-hydroxystearic acid was further converted into 10-oxostearic acid, via enzymatic cascade with a secondary alcohol dehydrogenase (MlADH) from Micrococcus luteus WIUJH20, using a lactate dehydrogenase (LdLDH) from Lactobacillus delbrueckii to drive the co-enzyme regeneration. The cascade reaction was carried out stepwise in one pot. Total conversion reached 95.0% after 10 h reaction at a scale of 1 L, with a space time yield of 217 g L−1 d−1. The final yield of 10-oxostearic acid isolated was 52.2% (mol mol−1), with a purity of &gt;99.0%. © 2019 The Authors},

The average runoff volume from the bioretention cell was 82% lower than that of the traditional asphalt pavement section. Water quality samples from bioretention effluents showed a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in various pollutants, including indicator bacteria. For indicator bacteria, the bioretention showed an overall E. coli removal of 49%. Antecedent dry periods were found to influence the treatment performance of runoff reduction and water quality improvement. The bioretention cell field results were used to evaluate WinSLAMM model performance, and the calibrated model outflow volumes were not significantly (p > 0.05) different and showed a strong correlation with the observed results and calculated storage volumes. © 2019},

abstract={This paper presents a method for accurate and efficient computations on scalar, vector and tensor fields in three-dimensional spherical polar coordinates. The method uses spin-weighted spherical harmonics in the angular directions and rescaled Jacobi polynomials in the radial direction. For the 2-sphere, spin-weighted harmonics allow for automating calculations in a fashion as similar to Fourier series as possible. Derivative operators act as wavenumber multiplication on a set of spectral coefficients. After transforming the angular directions, a set of orthogonal tensor rotations put the radially dependent spectral coefficients into individual spaces each obeying a particular regularity condition at the origin. These regularity spaces have remarkably simple properties under standard vector-calculus operations, such as gradient and divergence. We use a hierarchy of rescaled Jacobi polynomials for a basis on these regularity spaces. It is possible to select the Jacobi-polynomial parameters such that all relevant operators act in a minimally banded way. Altogether, the geometric structure allows for the accurate and efficient solution of general partial differential equations in the unit ball. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Objective: Milk holds an anti-inflammatory response that is particularly important to protecting infants against necrotizing enterocolitis. Milk might also exert anti-inflammatory effects in adulthood, including the oral cavity where macrophages of the oral mucosal control innate immunity defense. It remains unknown, however, whether milk can modulate the local inflammatory response by affecting the polarization of macrophages. Material and Methods: To determine whether pasteurized human milk and pasteurized cow milk can provoke macrophage polarization, murine bone marrow macrophages and RAW264.7 cells were exposed to human saliva or the inflammatory cytokines IL1β and TNFα. Activation of pro-(M1) inflammatory response is indicated by the expression of IL1 and IL8. To determine polarization towards a M2 phenotype, the expression of arginase 1 (ARG1) and chitinase-like 3 (Chil3) was determined by reverse transcriptase PCR and immunoassay. Western blot was done on phosphorylated p38 and JNK. Results: Aqueous fractions of human milk and cow milk from different donors, respectively, significantly decreased the inflammatory response of primary macrophages and RAW264.7 cells when exposed to saliva or IL1 and TNFα. Similar to IL4, human milk and cow milk caused a robust expression of ARG1 and Chil3 in primary macrophages. The polarization of macrophages by pasteurized milk occurred independent of the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK. Conclusion: These data suggest that pasteurized milk, independent of the origin, can cause the polarization of macrophages from a pro-inflammatory M1 towards a pro-resolving M2 phenotype. Thus, milk might have a protective role for the oral cavity by modulation of the macrophage-based innate immune system. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient, which in excessive concentrations from sewage treatment systems can cause eutrophication of waterways. The use of adsorption substrates is becoming a common method for P-removal from wastewater. To achieve sustained P-removal from passive wastewater treatment systems, such as constructed wetlands, it is essential to select substrates with a high capacity to retain P which can be replaced when saturated. An enriched hemp biochar substrate was added to experimental constructed wetland cells to treat domestic wastewater. Hemp feedstock was treated with hematite, melanterite and dolomite prior to pyrolysis at 400 °C. The amount of P which was present in the wastewater from the biochar wetlands cells after treatment was compared to gravel control wetland cells. During the 7-month study period, the wetlands containing the enriched biochar consistently reduced PO4-P concentrations in primary treated sewage to lower levels than in the control wetlands, with an average inlet P concentration of 15.5 mg/L, to below 2 mg/L. Various analytical methods were used to characterise the changes in the biochar substrate. Concentration of P in the substrate increased by 77% over the test period. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed iron phosphate formation. Scanning electron microscopy together with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM–EDX) showed P captured on the biochar surface was associated with aluminium, silica, iron, magnesium and calcium-rich mineral phases. This study showed that an enriched biochar can be used as a substrate to capture phosphorus in passive wastewater treatment. © 2019},

abstract={The word “ontology” was introduced to information systems when only closed-world reasoning systems were available. It was “borrowed” from philosophy, but literal links to its philosophical meaning were explicitly disavowed. Since then, open-world reasoning systems based on description logics have been developed, OWL has become a standard, and philosophical issues have been raised. The result has too often been confusion. The question “What statements are ontological” receives a variety of answers. A clearer vocabulary that is better suited to today's information systems is needed. The project to base ICD-11 on a “Common Ontology” required addressing this confusion. This paper sets out to systematise the lessons of that experience and subsequent discussions. We explore the semantics of open-world and closed-world systems. For specifying knowledge bases and software, we propose “invariants” or, more fully, “the first order invariant part of the background domain knowledge base” as an alternative to the words “ontology” and “ontological.” We discuss the role and limitations of OWL and description logics and how they are complementary to closed world systems such as frames and to less formal “knowledge organisation systems”. We illustrate why the conventions of classifications such as ICD cannot be formulated directly in OWL, but can be linked to OWL knowledge bases by queries. We contend that while OWL and description logics are major advances for representing invariants and terminologies, they must be combined with other technologies to represent broader background knowledge faithfully. The ICD-11 architecture is one approach. We argue that such hybrid architectures can and should be developed further. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={In this paper we present and analyze finite difference numerical schemes for the Cahn-Hilliard equation with a logarithmic Flory Huggins energy potential. Both first and second order accurate temporal algorithms are considered. In the first order scheme, we treat the nonlinear logarithmic terms and the surface diffusion term implicitly, and update the linear expansive term and the mobility explicitly. We provide a theoretical justification that this numerical algorithm has a unique solution, such that the positivity is always preserved for the logarithmic arguments, i.e., the phase variable is always between −1 and 1, at a point-wise level. In particular, our analysis reveals a subtle fact: the singular nature of the logarithmic term around the values of −1 and 1 prevents the numerical solution reaching these singular values, so that the numerical scheme is always well-defined as long as the numerical solution stays similarly bounded at the previous time step. Furthermore, an unconditional energy stability of the numerical scheme is derived, without any restriction for the time step size. Such an analysis technique can also be applied to a second order numerical scheme in which the BDF temporal stencil is applied, the expansive term is updated by a second order Adams-Bashforth explicit extrapolation formula, and an artificial Douglas-Dupont regularization term is added to ensure the energy dissipativity. The unique solvability and the positivity-preserving property for the second order scheme are proved using similar ideas, namely, the singular nature of the logarithmic term plays an essential role. For both the first and second order accurate schemes, we are able to derive an optimal rate convergence analysis. The case with a non-constant mobility is analyzed as well. We also describe a practical and efficient multigrid solver for the proposed numerical schemes, and present some numerical results, which demonstrate the robustness of the numerical schemes. © 2019},

abstract={Emissions from transportation sources can impact local air quality and contribute to adverse health effects. The Kansas City Transportation and Local-Scale Air Quality Study (KCTRAQS), conducted over a 1-year period, researched emissions source characterization in the Argentine, Turner, and Armourdale, Kansas (KS) neighborhoods and the broader southeast Kansas City, KS area. This area is characterized as a near-source environment with impacts from large railyard operations, major roadways, and commercial and industrial facilities. The spatial and meteorological effects of particulate matter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5), and black carbon (BC) pollutants on potential population exposures were evaluated at multiple sites using a combination of regulatory grade methods and instrumentation, low-cost sensors, citizen science, and mobile monitoring. The initial analysis of a subset of these data showed that mean reference grade PM2.5 concentrations (gravimetric) across all sites ranged from 7.92 to 9.34 μg/m3. Mean PM2.5 concentrations from low-cost sensors ranged from 3.30 to 5.94 μg/m3 (raw, uncorrected data). Pollution wind rose plots suggest that the sites are impacted by higher PM2.5 and BC concentrations when the winds originate near known source locations. Initial data analysis indicated that the observed PM2.5 and BC concentrations are driven by multiple air pollutant sources and meteorological effects. The KC-TRAQS overview and preliminary data analysis presented will provide a framework for forthcoming papers that will further characterize emission source attributions and estimate near-source exposures. This information will ultimately inform and clarify the extent and impact of air pollutants in the Kansas City area. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={This paper presents an explicit vertex centred finite volume method for the solution of fast transient isothermal large strain solid dynamics via a system of first order hyperbolic conservation laws. Building upon previous work developed by the authors, in the context of alternative numerical discretisations, this paper explores the use of a series of enhancements (both from the formulation and numerical standpoints) in order to explore some limiting scenarios, such as the consideration of near and true incompressibility. Both Total and Updated Lagrangian formulations are presented and compared at the discrete level, where very small differences between both descriptions are observed due to the excellent discrete satisfaction of the involutions. In addition, a matrix-free tailor-made artificial compressibility algorithm is discussed and combined with an angular momentum projection algorithm. A wide spectrum of numerical examples is thoroughly examined. The scheme shows excellent (stable, consistent and accurate) behaviour, in comparison with other methodologies, in compressible, nearly incompressible and truly incompressible bending dominated scenarios, yielding equal second order of convergence for velocities, deviatoric and volumetric components of the stress. © 2019},

abstract={The extensive research for predicting highly expressed genes in plant genome sequences has been going on for decades. The codon usage pattern of genes in Arabidopsis thaliana genome is a classical topic for plant biologists for its significance in the understanding of molecular plant biology. Here we have used a gene expression profiling methodology based on the score of modified relative codon bias (MRCBS) to elucidate expression pattern of genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. MRCBS relies exclusively on sequence features for identifying the highly expressed genes. In this study, a critical analysis of predicted highly expressed (PHE) genes in Arabidopsis thaliana has been performed using MRCBS as a numerical estimator of gene expression level. Consistent with previous other results, our study indicates that codon composition plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression. We found a systematic strong correlation between MRCBS and CAI (codon adaptation index) or other expression-measures. Additionally, MRCBS correlates well with experimental gene expression data. Our study highlights the relationship between gene expression and compositional signature in relation to codon usage bias and sets the ground for the further investigation of the evolution of the protein-coding genes in the plant genome. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={In order to enhance the ecological value of vertical hard coastal structures, hybrid designs with complex surface textures (such as a combination of grooves and pits) have been recommended. This strategy optimises ecological colonisation at two spatial scales: 1) at the mm-scale for barnacle abundance (shown to have bioprotective capabilities), and 2) at the cm-scale for species richness and abundance through the incorporation/creation of habitat features. To determine the optimal design for improving the intertidal habitat quality of vertical coastal defence structures, we conducted an ecological enhancement trial involving 160 artificial concrete tiles of different designs (and thus topographic complexity) and 24 cleared natural surfaces (150 × 150 mm) at three sites in the UK. Within 18 months, tile designs with intermediate levels of complexity (mm-scale surface roughness) were optimal in increasing barnacle cover compared to plain-cast tiles. Tiles with high complexity (with microhabitat recesses up to 30 mm deep) developed greatest species richness and mobile species abundance and had lowest peak air temperatures and highest humidity. Such textured ecological enhancements can help improve the habitat value of existing and future hard coastal structures by favouring the conservation of intertidal species in urban marine habitats and enhancing otherwise weak or absent ecosystem service provision. © 2019},

We evaluated the expression pattern of CBR3-AS1 in breast cancer tissues and cell lines, explored the correlation between CBR3-AS1 expression and the survival time of breast cancer patients, and probed the effect of CBR3-AS1 on tumor progression of breast cancer through loss-of-function and gain-of-function strategies. Our results showed that CBR3-AS1 was overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and cell lines and predicted the prognosis of breast cancer patients. And CBR3-AS1 exerted biological function as an oncogenic lncRNA, involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, colony formation, apoptosis and tumor growth in breast cancer. Taken together, CBR3-AS1 was up-regulated in breast cancer and promoted the risk of breast cancer.

abstract={Anaplasmosis, the most prevalent tick-transmitted disease of cattle, is caused by the rickettsial intracellular parasite Anaplasma marginale. The pathogen replicates within a parasitophorous vacuole formed from the invagination of the erythrocyte membrane. Several strains of A. marginale form “tails” or “appendages” which are attached to, and extend out from, the cytoplasmic side of the parasitophorous vacuole. Genomic analysis of the parasite antigen distributed along the appendage led to the discovery of the aaap (Anaplasma appendage associated protein) gene family located within a highly plastic region in the genome. The aaap gene family consists of aaap and several alps (for aaap-like proteins), depending on the strain. These genes/proteins are characterized by repeat sequences. To investigate locus plasticity, different versions of the locus were cloned from the same strain as well as from different strains, sequenced and aligned to identify changes. Our findings show that repeat sequences both within and between genes facilitated rearrangement events within the locus. Structural variation of the locus in the St. Maries strain was further investigated during infection of different cellular environments, i.e., bovine erythrocytes and tick cells, with a reduction in subpopulations of the aaap locus within the tick as compared to erythrocytes. Interestingly, subpopulations bearing alternative locus structures began to arise again when the pathogen was transferred from the tick environment into a naïve calf. Additionally, the Aaap protein expression profile between blood and tick samples showed a regulatory shift, indicating a host-specific response. Alignment of the protein sequences from different species of Anaplasma reveals six similar repeating motifs that appear to be unique to a few species of Anaplasma. The role the aaap locus may play in the pathogenesis of the bovine host or in tick infection/transmission remains unknown; however, the changes in aaap locus subpopulations, locus structure, and protein expression indicate that these genes have a role in strain diversification. © 2019},

abstract={Background and aim: The Receptor Activity Modifying Proteins (RAMPs) are a group of accessory proteins, of which there are three in humans, that interact with a number of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) and play various roles in regulation of endocrine signaling. Studies in RAMP3 knockout (KO) mice reveal an age related phenotype with altered metabolic regulation and high bone mass. To translate these findings into a clinically relevant perspective, we investigated the association between RAMP3 gene variants, body composition and bone phenotypes in two population-based cohorts of Swedish women. Methods: Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the vicinity of the RAMP3 gene were genotyped in the PEAK-25 cohort (n = 1061; 25 years) and OPRA (n = 1044; 75 years). Bone mineral density (BMD), fat mass and lean mass (total body; regional) were measured by DXA at baseline, 5 and 10 year follow-up. Results: BMD did not differ with RAMP3 genotype in either cohort, although fracture risk was increased in the elderly women (OR 2.695 [95% CI 1.514–4.801]). Fat mass tended to be higher with RAMP3 SNPs; although only in elderly women. In the young women, changes in BMI and fat mass between ages 25–35 differed by genotype (p = 0.001; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Variation in RAMP3 may contribute to age-related changes in body composition and risk of fracture. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The objective of the present study was to determine the influence of dietary supplementation with pomegranate seed oil (PSO) and/or an aqueous extract of dried bitter melon fruits (BME) on breast cancer risk and fatty acid profile in serum of female rats with chemical carcinogen-inflicted mammary tumours. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 96) were fed control diet or experimental diets supplemented with 0.15 ml PSO/day, BME or jointly PSO and BME. After 21 weeks mammary tumours were subjected to histopathological examination and in serum fatty acids, 8-isoprostaglandin F 2α content and indices of desaturases activity were analysed. Supplementation of the diet with PSO and BME did not inhibit the breast cancer formation. Conjugated linolenic acids (CLnA), present in PSO, were converted into cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), however, its content was lower in groups treated with a carcinogen. A similar tendency was observed for the content of SFA, MUFA, PUFA, 8-iso PGF 2α and the activity of Δ 6 -desaturase. Enhanced pro-carcinogenic effect of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), caused by applied supplements, may be a result of their influence on DMBA metabolism. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Cux1 is a homeodomain protein involved in cell cycle regulation and kidney development. Cux1 represses the cyclin kinase inhibitor p27 during early kidney development, promoting cell proliferation in the nephrogenic zone. Promoter reporter analysis of p27 revealed that Cux1 represses p27 in a concentration dependent manner, and immunoprecipitation showed that Cux1 interacts with the co-repressor Grg4 and the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) identified the interaction of Cux1, Grg4, HDAC1, and HDAC3 at two different sites in the p27 promoter. To determine whether there was an interaction between these two loci in the developing kidney, we performed chromatin conformation capture (3C) assay. Analysis of newborn kidney tissue with 3C and ChIP-loop showed that the p27 promoter forms a loop intersecting at these two loci and that Cux1 bridges these two sites. To determine whether HDACs are required for Cux1 repression of p27 we analyzed p27 promoter activity in the presence of the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). TSA treatment completely relieved the repression of p27 by Cux1 and Grg4, demonstrating that Cux1 represses p27 in an HDAC dependent manner. To begin to test whether HDAC inhibitors could be used to target Cux1 repression of p27 for the treatment of PKD, we treated Pkd1 targeted pregnant mice with TSA or vehicle beginning at embryonic day 10.5 until embryonic day 18.5. Newborn Pkd1 mutant mice that received vehicle exhibited extensive collecting duct cysts, while newborn Pkd1 mutant mice that received TSA showed a significant reduction in cysts. Moreover, p27 expression was upregulated in TSA treated Pkd1 mice. Taken together, these results suggest that HDACs are required for cyst growth, and further support studies indicating that HDAC inhibitors may be an effective treatment for PKD. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={During the last decades, both governments and companies have been committed to the continuous checking of biological parameters, which can prevent extra costs to administrations. A very efficient way to address this issue is by designing biosensors. This contribution reviews the advances made using optical fibre technology, which have lately agglutinated much of the scientific interest related to the development of biosensors. However, the wide number of publications describing the use of optical fibre for detecting biomarkers has probably blurred the main goal: obtaining portable, simple, easy-to-handle and cost-effective biosensors. With this purpose, this contribution presents some optical fibre structures which have been analysed in terms of several optical parameters of interest from a photonics point of view: sensitivity, quality factor, full width at half minimum, limit of detection and figure of merit. This has made it possible to classify the most advanced optical fibre sensing techniques and, hence, their suitability when developing biosensing applications. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Dengue virus (DENV), an arthropod-borne virus, has rapidly spread in recent years. DENV diagnosis is performed through virus serology, isolation or molecular detection, while genotyping is usually done through Sanger sequencing of the envelope gene. This study aimed to optimize the use of shotgun metagenomics and subsequent bioinformatics analysis to detect and type DENV directly from clinical samples without targeted amplification. Additionally, presence of DENV quasispecies (intra-host variation) was revealed by detecting single nucleotide variants. Viral RNA was isolated with or without DNase-I treatment from 17 DENV (1–4) positive blood samples. cDNA libraries were generated using either a combination of the NEBNext® RNA to synthesize cDNA followed by Nextera XT DNA library preparation, or the TruSeq RNA V2 (TS) library preparation kit. Libraries were sequenced using both the MiSeq and NextSeq. Bioinformatic analysis showed complete ORFs for all samples by all approaches, but longer contigs and higher sequencing depths were obtained with the TS kit. No differences were observed between MiSeq and NextSeq sequencing. Detection of multiple DENV serotypes in a single sample was feasible. Finally, results were obtained within three days with associated reagents costs between €130−170/sample. Therefore, shotgun metagenomics is suitable for identification and typing of DENV in a clinical setting. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins are conserved RNA-binding proteins that play major roles in RNA metabolism. They function as molecular adaptors, facilitate spliceosome assembly and modulate constitutive and alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs. Pre-mRNAs encoding SR proteins and many other proteins involved in stress responses are extensively alternatively spliced in response to diverse stresses. Hence, it is proposed that stress-induced changes in splice isoforms contribute to the adaptation of plants to stress responses. However, functions of most SR genes and their splice isoforms in stress responses are not known. Lack of easy and robust tools hindered the progress in this area. Emerging technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 will facilitate studies of SR function by enabling the generation of single and multiple knock-out mutants of SR subfamily members. Moreover, CRISPR/Cas13 allows targeted manipulation of splice isoforms from SR and other genes in a constitutive or tissue-specific manner to evaluate functions of individual splice variants. Identification of the in vivo targets of SR proteins and their splice variants using the recently developed TRIBE (Targets of RNA-binding proteins Identified By Editing) and other methods will help unravel their mode of action and splicing regulatory elements under various conditions. These new approaches are expected to provide significant new insights into the roles of SRs and splice isoforms in plants adaptation to diverse stresses. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A series of eight experiments were carried out to analyse the effects of light intensity, light duration and photoperiods on a microalgae culture for treating AnMBR effluent at an outdoor photobioreactor (PBR) plant. Improved performance was achieved in terms of nutrient recovery rates, biomass productivity and effluent nutrient concentrations at a higher net photon flux. However, the higher irradiance was also responsible for lower biomass productivity:light irradiance ratios. None of the experiments with different lighting regimes and the same net photon flux showed any significant differences. The data obtained suggest that microalgae performance in this system did not depend on the time of day when light was applied or the length of the photoperiods, but on the net photon flux. No photoinhibiton was observed in any of the experiments, probably because of the significant shadow effect on the microalgae in the PBRs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Androgens are steroid hormones essential for human male and female development. Steroid reductases 5α (SRD5As)are key enzymes in androgen biosynthesis. Mutations in the human SRD5A2 are known to cause loss-of-function and severe 46,XY undervirilization. Gain-of-function variants have been suggested in androgen excess syndromes, but have not been found so far. Therefore we searched for gain-of-function mutations in the human SRD5A2 gene which might explain hyperandrogenic disorders such as the polycystic ovary syndrome, premature adrenarche and prostate cancer. We screened databases for candidate variants and characterised them in silico with the help of a novel SRD5A2 model. We selected 9 coding SNPs (A49T, R50A, P106L, P106A, N122A, L167S, R168C, P173S, R227Q)that have not been described in manifesting individuals, and assessed their enzyme kinetic properties in HEK293 cells. SRD5A2 activity was assessed by conversion of testosterone (T), progesterone (Prog)and androstenedione (Δ4A)to their 5α-reduced metabolites. Variants R50A and P173S showed partial activity with substrates T (34% and 28%)and Δ4A (37% and 22%). With substrate Prog variants P106L, P106A, L167S and R168C in addition showed partial activity (15% to 64%). Functional testing of all other variants showed loss-of-function. As predicted in our in silico analysis, all coding SNPs affected enzyme activity, however none of them showed gain-of-function. Thus excess 5α-reductase activity might be rather regulated at the (post)-transcriptional and/or post-translational level. However through this work seven new coding SNPs were characterised which might be of clinical relevance. It is possible that individuals carrying these SNPs show a minor phenotype that is not yet identified. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Microplastics (MPs) have recently been detected in oceans, seas and freshwater bodies worldwide, yet few studies have revealed the occurrence of MPs in potable water. Although the potential toxicological effects of MPs are still largely unknown, their presence in water intended for human consumption deserves attention. Drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) pose a barrier for MPs to enter drinking water; thus, the fate of MPs at DWTPs is of great interest. This review includes a summary of the available information on MPs in drinking water sources and in potable water, discusses the current knowledge on MP removal by different water treatment processes, and identifies the research needs regarding MP removal by DWTP technologies. A comparison of MPs with other common pollution agents is also provided. We concluded that special attention should be given to small-size MPs (in the range of several micrometres) and that the relationship between MP character and behaviour during distinct treatment processes should be explored. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Representing hydrologic connectivity of non-floodplain wetlands (NFWs) to downstream waters in process-based models is an emerging challenge relevant to many research, regulatory, and management activities. We review four case studies that utilize process-based models developed to simulate NFW hydrology. Models range from a simple, lumped parameter model to a highly complex, fully distributed model. Across case studies, we highlight appropriate application of each model, emphasizing spatial scale, computational demands, process representation, and model limitations. We end with a synthesis of recommended “best modeling practices” to guide model application. These recommendations include: (1) clearly articulate modeling objectives, and revisit and adjust those objectives regularly; (2) develop a conceptualization of NFW connectivity using qualitative observations, empirical data, and process-based modeling; (3) select a model to represent NFW connectivity by balancing both modeling objectives and available resources; (4) use innovative techniques and data sources to validate and calibrate NFW connectivity simulations; and (5) clearly articulate the limits of the resulting NFW connectivity representation. Our review and synthesis of these case studies highlights modeling approaches that incorporate NFW connectivity, demonstrates tradeoffs in model selection, and ultimately provides actionable guidance for future model application and development. © 2019 American Water Resources Association},

abstract={In metazoan genome, the mechanism of gene expression regulation between transcriptional regulatory elements and their target gene is spatiotemporal. Active promoters possess many specific chromosomal features, such as hypersensitive to DNaseI and enrichment of specific histone modifications. In this article, we proposed a novel method which possesses a high efficiency to find promoters in vitro. A promoter-trap library was constructed with totally 706 random mouse genomic DNA fragment clones, and 260 promoter-active fragments of the library were screened by transient transfection into 4T1 cells. To demonstrate the accuracy of this promoter finding method, 13 fragments with promoter activities were randomly selected for published DNase-seq and ChIP-seq data analysis, downstream transcripts prediction and expression confirmation. qRT-PCR results showed that six predicted transcription units were successfully amplified in different mouse tissues/cells or in reconstituted mouse mammary tumors. Our results indicate that this promoter finding method can successfully detect the promoter-active fragments and their downstream transcripts. © 2019},

abstract={The paired-type homeodomain transcription factor Uncx is involved in multiple processes of embryogenesis in vertebrates. Reasoning that zebrafish genes uncx4.1 and uncx are orthologs of mouse Uncx, we studied their genomic environment and developmental expression. Evolutionary analyses indicate the zebrafish uncx genes as being paralogs deriving from teleost-specific whole-genome duplication. Whole-mount in situ mRNA hybridization of uncx transcripts in zebrafish embryos reveals novel expression domains, confirms those previously known, and suggests sub-functionalization of paralogs. Using genetic mutants and pharmacological inhibitors, we investigate the role of signaling pathways on the expression of zebrafish uncx genes in developing somites. In identifying putative functional role(s) of zebrafish uncx genes, we hypothesized that they encode transcription factors that coordinate growth and innervation of somitic muscles. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={The successful phytoextraction of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) from polluted soils can be achieved by growing non-food and industrial crops. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) is one of the main industrial crops and is widely grown in many countries. Tobacco can uptake high concentrations of PTEs especially in aboveground biomass without suffering from toxicity. This review highlighted the potential of tobacco for the phytoextraction of heavy metals and tolerance mechanisms under metal stress. Different management practices have been discussed which can enhance the potential of this plant for metal extraction. Finally, suitable options for the management/disposal of biomass enriched in excess metal have been elaborated to prevent secondary pollution. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Cancers are one of the leading causes of deaths affecting millions of people around the world, therefore they are currently a major public health problem. The treatment of cancer is based on surgical resection, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or immunotherapy, much of which is often insufficient and cause serious, burdensome and undesirable side effects. For many years, assorted secondary metabolites derived from plants have been used as antitumor agents. Recently, researchers have discovered a large number of new natural substances which can effectively interfere with cancer cells’ metabolism. The most famous groups of these compounds are topoisomerase and mitotic inhibitors. The aim of the latest research is to characterize natural compounds found in many common foods, especially by means of their abilities to regulate cell cycle, growth and differentiation, as well as epigenetic modulation. In this paper, we focus on a review of recent discoveries regarding nature-derived anticancer agents. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Background: Toltrazuril is frequently administered for the metaphylactic control of piglet cystoisosporosis. In a previous study, the efficacy of parenteral toltrazuril (45 mg/piglet, Group Forceris®) applied on the 2nd day of life (dol), and of oral toltrazuril (20 mg/kg of body weight, Group Baycox®) applied on the 4th dol was evaluated in an experimental model with Cystoisospora suis infection on the 3rd dol (late infection, LI). In a follow-up study, efficacy and safety were evaluated against infections with C. suis on the 1st dol (early infection, EI). Parameters included oocyst excretion and faecal consistency, body weight development, bacteriological examinations and animal health. Results: All control piglets (n = 12) shed oocysts and had diarrhoea, while parasite excretion was completely suppressed in both treatment groups (n = 13 each) and diarrhoea was reduced to a single animal (Forceris® group), resulting in significant differences for these parameters between the treated groups and the controls without significant differences among the treatment groups. No treatment-related adverse events were noted. Body weight gain was reduced in the control group during the acute phase of infection, resulting in significantly lower body weight on the 15th dol. Sows and piglets shed high numbers of Escherichia coli. Clostridium perfringens type A was only detected in low amounts in pooled litter samples. In comparison to the LI study oocyst shedding was more intense in the control animals in EI, while diarrhea was more frequent in LI. In both infection models a high efficacy of toltrazuril in the control of parasitological and clinical outcomes of experimental C. suis infection could be demonstrated. Since in the LI study high numbers of Cl. perfringens type A were detected, it is hypothesized that colonization with these opportunistic pathogens has synergistic effects with C. suis and may explain variable clinical outcomes in untreated animals as well as the sporadic occurrence of diarrhea in toltrazuril-treated piglets. Conclusions: Parenteral and oral toltrazuril administered on the 2nd or 4th dol is safe and effective against experimental infections with C. suis on the 1st to 3rd dol. The clinical outcome of experimental infections seems influenced by bacterial coinfections. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={Ethnopharmacological relevance: There are insufficient safe and effective treatments for chronic pain in pets. In cases such as osteoarthritis there is no commercially available cure and veterinarians use NSAIDs to manage pain. Pet owners may have to plan for a lifetime of plant-based treatment for the conditions that lead to chronic pain in pets. Phytopharmacotherapies have the advantage of being less toxic, cheap or free, readily available, are more likely to be safe for long-term use and have the potential to reset the immune system to normal functioning. Aim of the study: To examine the recently published medicinal plant research that matches unpublished data on ethnoveterinary medicines (EVM) used for pets in Canada (British Columbia) to see if the EVM data can provide a lead to the development of necessary drugs. Materials and methods: In 2003 semi-structured interviews were conducted with 60 participants who were organic farmers or holisitic medicinal/veterinary practitioners obtained using a purposive sample. A draft manual prepared from the data was then evaluated by participants at a participatory workshop that discussed the plant-based treatments. A copy of the final version of the manual was given to all research participants. In 2018, the recently published research matching the EVM data was reviewed to see if the EVM practices could serve as a lead for further research. Results and conclusion: Medicinal plants are used to treat a range of conditions. The injuries treated in pets in British Columbia included abscesses (resulting from an initial injury), sprains and abrasions. Dogs were also treated with medicinal plants for rheumatoid arthritis, joint pain and articular cartilage injuries. More than 40 plants were used. Anal gland problems were treated with Allium sativum L., Aloe vera L., Calendula officinalis L., Plantago major L., Ulmus fulva Michx., Urtica dioica L. and Usnea longissima Ach. Arctium lappa, Hydrangea arborescens and Lactuca muralis were used for rheumatoid arthritis and joint pain in pets. Asthma was treated with: Linum usitatissimum L., Borago officinalis L., Verbascum thapsus L., Cucurbita pepo L., Lobelia inflata L., and Zingiber officinale Roscoe. Pets with heart problems were treated with Crataegus oxyacantha L., Cedronella canariensis (L.) Willd. ex Webb & Berth, Equisetum palustre L., Cypripedium calceolus L., Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex Lawson, Humulus lupulus L., Valeriana officinalis L., Lobelia inflata L., Stachys officinalis (L.) Trev., and Viscum album L. The following plants were used for epilepsy, motion sickness and anxiety- Avena sativa L., Valeriana officinalis, Lactuca muralis (L.) Fresen., Scutellaria lateriflora L., Satureja hortensis L., and Passiflora incarnata L. Plants used for cancer treatment included Phytolacca decandra, Ganoderma lucidum, Lentinula edodes, Rumex acetosella, Arctium lappa, Ulmus fulva, Rheum palmatum, Frangula purshiana, Zingiber officinale, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Ulmus fulva, Althea officinalis, Rheum palmatum, Rumex crispus and Plantago psyllium. Trifolium pratense was used for tumours in the prostate gland. Also used were Artemisia annua, Taraxacum officinale and Rumex crispus. This review of plants used in EVM was possible because phytotherapy research of the plants described in this paper has continued because few new pharmaceutical drugs have been developed for chronic pain and because treatments like glucocorticoid therapy do not heal. Phytotherapuetic products are also being investigated to address the overuse of antibiotics. There have also been recent studies conducted on plant-based functional foods and health supplements for pets, however there are still gaps in the knowledge base for the plants Stillingia sylvatica, Verbascum thapsus, Yucca schidigera and Iris versicolor and these need further investigation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Peatlands provide a range of ecosystem services but are sensitive to changes in climate and land-use, and many peatlands globally are degraded. We analyse a large-scale, unique and diverse dataset, collected over 15 years, as part of major landscape scale blanket peat restoration projects in the south Pennines, UK. Trajectories of ecosystem change after restoration were assessed by measuring key ecosystem responses including: vegetation cover and indicator species; water table, runoff, and water quality. The reactions of these metrics vary in their behaviour, both in the timing of first response and the rate of change towards a new stable state. Re-establishment of vegetation is a key driver in rapidly reducing particulate carbon loss and attenuating stormflow, while over time biodiversity is improved by the return of native species, and water tables gradually rise. The phasing of these ecosystem service responses indicates that there are different characteristic timescales for the improvement of peatland functions, driven by both surface and subsurface processes. The rapid establishment of vegetation cover over two years, and its importance in improving a broad range of functions, signify it as a key milestone for reporting project success within typical funding timeframes. This study supports the adoption of Lime-Fertiliser-Seed-Mulch restoration on eroding blanket peatlands globally. The trajectories developed are important to help guide practitioners of ecological restoration. Better understanding of the dynamics underpinning the slower response times of subsurface hydrological and biogeochemical function is identified as a key knowledge gap. An understanding of the limits of ecosystems recovery is important when target setting for restoration projects, especially where attaining pristine conditions is unachievable. © 2019},

abstract={A comprehensive view of all the structural aspects related to NCp7 is essential to understand how this protein, crucial in many steps of the HIV-1 cycle, binds and anneals nucleic acids (NAs), mainly thanks to two zinc fingers, ZF1 and ZF2. Here, we inspected the structural properties of the available experimental models of NCp7 bound to either DNA or RNA molecules, or free of ligand. Our analyses included the characterization of the relative positioning of ZF1 and ZF2, accessibility measurements and the exhaustive, quantitative mapping of the contacts between amino acids and nucleotides by a recent tessellation method, VLDM. This approach unveiled the intimate connection between NA binding process and the conformations explored by the free protein. It also provided new insights into the functional specializations of ZF1 and ZF2. The larger accessibility of ZF2 in free NCp7 and the consistency of the ZF2/NA interface in different models and conditions give ZF2 the lead of the binding process. ZF1 contributes to stabilize the complexes through various organizations of the ZF1/NA interface. This work outcome is a global binding scheme of NCp7 to DNA and RNA, and an example of how protein–NA complexes are stabilized. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The amino acetonitrile derivative, monepantel, represented the first new broad spectrum anthelmintic to be brought to market for use in sheep for over 25 years when it was introduced in 2009. This study characterised monepantel efficacy, using faecal egg count reduction and controlled efficacy tests, against gastrointestinal nematodes following a report of treatment failure in a UK lowland sheep flock. Twelve lambs were each artificially administered 15,000 infective larvae that had been propagated from lamb faeces collected from the farm of interest. The controlled efficacy test showed that a recommended dose rate of monepantel (2.5 mg/kg body weight) administered at day 28 post infection was ineffective at removing the infection in the treated lambs. The result demonstrated simultaneous resistance to monepantel in Teladorsagia circumcincta, Trichostrongylus vitrinus and Oesophagostomum venulosum with efficacies based on adult worm burden reductions, compared to untreated controls, of 78%, 27% and 22% respectively. Monepantel efficacy based on undifferentiated egg count in treated animals, seven day post administration, compared to untreated controls was 85%. The results raise questions about the origins of, and predisposing factors for, resistance development in the three different species, and reinforces the value of differentiating post treatment faecal egg counts to genus or species level. © 2019},

abstract={Current diagnostic methods for detecting the presence or absence of Dictyocaulus viviparus in dairy herds, are insensitive when based on detection of antibody levels in bulk tank milk (BTM). Here we present a novel technique to confirm the presence of the parasite based on a pooled-milk sample from 10 randomly selected first – lactation heifers (FLH). This study was run in two parts. First, a longitudinal study was performed to look at infection dynamics in milk samples across the grazing season using a prototype ELISA developed by Svanova (Boehringer-Ingelheim, Uppsala). We identified that mean ODR values in milk samples from FLH was significantly higher than that for older cows (0.13 versus 0.07 respectively, p < 0.001) suggesting that samples from the FLH cohort should be pooled to produce the test. Second, the pooled – milk test was evaluated on a cross-sectional survey of UK dairy herds (n = 25 grazing and n = 25 zero-grazing herds) to evaluate test performance under field conditions. The optical density ratio (ODR) cut-off value for our pooled-milk test using 10 FLH milk samples was optimal at a value of 0.16. Pooling 10 FLH samples created a sensitivity and specificity of 66.7% and 95.5% respectively. In comparison, whole-herd BTM samples had a maximum sensitivity of 37.5% and specificity of 63.6% at an ODR cut-off of 0.18. The area under the curve according to receiver-operative-characteristic (ROC) analysis was high for the 10-heifer test (0.87) but poor for the whole herd BTM testing (0.45). This study provides a more sensitive diagnostic test strategy for the screening of D.viviparus in dairy herds. Testing herds at the end of a grazing season would facilitate the planning of effective control measures, such as the use of the lungworm vaccination or strategic deworming, for the following grazing season. This may prove to be a useful test strategy for the diagnosis of a variety of parasitic diseases of livestock. © 2019},

abstract={The present study evaluated the effects of coccidiosis on histological parameters and performance of broilers submitted to a mild challenge with Eimeria sp. A total of 132 broilers were randomly divided into two groups with 6 replicates of 11 birds each: negative control (NC) – birds uninfected and challenge (CH) - birds infected by gavage at day-one with 10x the manufacturer recommended dose of Bio-Coccivet R ® live vaccine by Biovet, with strains of E. acervulina, E. brunetti, E. maxima, E. necatrix, E. praecox, E. tenella and E. mitis. From 1 to 28 d of age, weekly the zootechnical performance was evaluated and samples of the liver, duodenum, jejunum and ileum were collected and submitted to histological analysis by the I See Inside methodology (ISI). The ISI methodology is a metric evaluation of histological alterations in the intestine and liver. Which translates macroscopic and microscopic alterations into numbers and allows their correlation with the animal zootechnical performance. Pearson's correlation was used to demonstrates how the damages to the gut, evaluated by ISI method, could affect negatively the performance of broilers. The presence of oocysts in histological analysis of the jejunum and ileum at 7d indicate a negative effect on performance over the next 2 weeks (14d and 21d). When the ISI total score was measured in the ileum at 14d, we observed a strong negative effect on zootechnical performance from that period on 14d, 21d and 28d. The obtained data demonstrates that the higher the ISI scores, the worse are the zootechnical performance results of broilers challenged with Eimeria sp. and the I See Inside scores could be applied to evaluate coccidiosis effect on performance in future. © 2019},

abstract={We present experimental measurements of the penetration depth of the bubble cloud generated by a plunging water jet, when this jet is oscillated parallel to the free surface. We demonstrate that when the Reynolds number is larger than 104 the penetration depth can be adequately described with the model introduced by Clanet and Lasheras (1997) for a non-oscillating jet tilted relative to the normal of the liquid surface, provided an effective inclination angle is introduced to account for the jet translation velocity. In the case of jets with a Reynolds number smaller than 104, we find that the penetration depth of the oscillated jet can be increased of up to 30% by moderate oscillation velocities. This increase of the penetration is due to the decrease of the mixing layer angle when the symmetry around the bubble cloud is broken by the oscillation. We finally discuss the shape of the overall region impacted by the oscillating bubble cloud. We show that there is a regime for which the penetration is maximum at the center of this region, and a regime for which the penetration is maximum at the periphery. We propose a cartography to predict when each regime is relevant. © 2019},

We identified 29 Lorentzian lines corresponding to 5D0 → 7F0-6 transitions obtained from photoluminescence spectra at 10 K. The levels were analyzed in terms of the 14 crystal field parameters corresponding to the site symmetry. The energy-level fit yielded a final standard deviation of 12.0 cm−1. The resulting crystal field strength parameter is Nv = 3869 ± 185. This value confirms the linear dependence on the host atomic radius predicted by the extended point charge electrostatic model (PCEM).

A maximum enhancement factor (EF) of 7.8 × 1014 for R6G and a 9.38% relative standard deviation (RSD) of repeatability at a R6G concentration of 10−12 M are obtained, confirming the high sensitivity and excellent uniformity. The strong SERS activity is ascribed to the advantages of photonic crystal effect of PSi PhC and microwave radiation in regulating absorption and distribution of Ag NPs on PSi PhC, which results in a high density of hot spot regions to improve the SERS signals.

abstract={Formic acid (FA) is a chemical with numerous industrial applications. Available literature including patents on FA processes are limited and do not provide sufficient information for process simulation. In the present study, a conventional FA process, known as the Kemira-Leonard (KL) process, for producing 98 wt% FA is developed and simulated using Aspen Plus V9. Then, heat integration and optimization of the process for two objectives (namely, minimization of total capital cost and annual utility cost) are performed. Finally, further improvement of the optimized process via vapor recompression (VR) is investigated. Bi-objective optimization provides many Pareto-optimal solutions for selection. Total annual cost (TAC) of the chosen optimized KL process without VR is found to be $19,887,834 (=0.724 USD/kg of FA produced), with total capital cost of $18,476,733. Addition of VR brings savings of $1,560,427 in annual utility cost, with an additional investment of $2,517,191 for the compressor and new heat exchangers; overall, this leads to TAC reduction of $1,035,748 (by 5.2%).

abstract={Carbon based materials are considered as a rewarding contestant for optical devices due to its novel properties. In this study, graphite is laser-ablated and different analytical methods such as XRD and Raman spectroscopy are used to evaluate the crystalline nature. In XRD, it indicates the decreased intensity after laser ablation but no change in peak positions resulted as graphite is very strong and hard material. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) used to evaluate structural characteristics shows the overlapping layered structure after ablation. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is prepared by using modified Hummers' method and reduced it by thermal reduction method. UV–Vis spectra confirmed the peaks of graphite and rGO at 274 nm and 267 nm, respectively. To study the carrier relaxation dynamics of graphite and rGO, ultrafast Visible-pump/NIR-probe femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy was used. Carrier relaxation occurred between 260 and 309 fs even after laser ablation damage, which is useful for future application of optical switching under high laser repetition. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={We investigated the effects of gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) challenge on activity patterns in first season grazing (FSG) steers exposed to two different levels of Ostertagia ostertagi and Cooperia oncophora. At turn-out, experimental animals were allocated to one of two treatment groups grazing in different enclosures each with 32 animals. The first group (High) received 5000 third stage (L3) O. ostertagi (50%) and C. onchophora (50%) larvae; whereas the second group (Low) were dewormed monthly with 0.5 mg ivermectin (Noromectin®, Pour-on) per kg bodyweight. Activity patterns were monitored by fitting some animals in each group (High, n = 10; Low, n = 8) with leg mounted sensors (IceTag® 3D-accelerometers) during three two-week periods. In animals fitted with sensors body weight gain (BWG) was recorded every fortnight, whereas faecal and blood samples were collected every four weeks for nematode faecal egg count (FEC) and serum pepsinogen concentrations (SPC). Differences between the periods in daily (P = 0.046) and diurnal (P = 0.0502) activities were recorded between groups during the course of the study. A significant (P = 0.038) increase in the number of lying bouts was recorded in group High during the second period (days 74–86), which was correlated (r = 0.55, P = 0.018) to an increase in SPC ≈ 85 days after turn-out. BWG was reduced (P = 0.037) in group High compared to group Low, deviating from day 45. Strongyle nematode eggs were observed in both groups 29 days after turn-out, however the mean EPG remained low in group Low throughout the experiment. An increase in SPC was observed (P < 0.0038) in group High with levels peaking on day 58. In conclusion, our data supports that changes in activity patterns monitored with sensors could contribute to the identification of animals challenged with GIN, but also improve our understanding in the potential welfare impairments caused by such infections. © 2019},

abstract={In order to investigate the infection dynamics of Cryptosporidium bovis and Cryptosporidium ryanae, a Swedish dairy farm known to be free of C. parvum was recruited for a one-year study. Fecal samples were collected every four weeks (a total of 13 occasions) from 20 randomly selected calves younger than 65 days. A total of 238 feces samples were collected directly from the rectum and then examined with immunofluorescence microscopy; those positive for Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were further processed by molecular species determination. Oocysts were found in 92 samples, and in 72 of these the species was successfully determined: 87.5% C. bovis, 9.7% C. ryanae and 2.8% a mix of both species. No C. parvum was found. The prevalence of shedding calves was highest at ages 4 and 5 weeks; however, the feces with the highest oocyst per gram (OPG) were registered at 2–4 weeks of age. This is earlier than what has been found in most other studies, indicating that the infection dynamics of C. bovis/C. ryanae may be affected by the presence of C. parvum. The OPG for the positive calves ranged from 200 to 1.1 × 106 (geometric mean 6.88 × 103). The youngest calf in which C. bovis was identified was 5 days old, and the youngest calf in which C. ryanae was identified was 15 days old. Calves’ housing type and seasonality were not associated with differences in the shedding of oocysts. Furthermore, there was no association between the presence of diarrhea and oocyst shedding. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The efficacy and safety of an injectable combination product containing toltrazuril and gleptoferron (Forceris ® – CEVA) for the control of coccidiosis due to Cystoisospora suis was investigated in neonatal piglets. The study was carried out on five European commercial pig farms in France, Germany and Spain and 122 litters consisting of 1508 piglets were selected and randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups. The first group received a single intramuscular injection per piglet of the test product, containing 45 mg toltrazuril and 200 mg iron and this was compared with a control group, which was administered a single intramuscular treatment of iron at 200 mg per piglet only. Body weights, faecal scores and oocysts counts, recorded as oocysts per gram of faeces, (OPG) were observed for 21 days. Only 1138 piglets were actually exposed to coccidiosis and data sets of these animals were selected for statistical analysis. The efficacy of the test product in the control of coccidiosis was shown in higher body weight gains, a lower percentage of animals with diarrhoea, fewer samples with positive oocysts counts as well as a lower excretion peak and a reduced area under the curve of OPG from study day (SD) 4 – SD 21. The combination product of toltrazuril and gleptoferron provided an effective alternative approach to current conventional separate treatment for the prevention of iron deficiency anaemia and coccidiosis in neonatal piglets. It reduced the numbers of potentially stressful interventions and work time. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Post-launch field investigations of recently-approved flea control products establish an efficacy baseline and in subsequent years can detect any efficacy decline suggestive of emerging resistance. As part of a continuing program of yearly assessment of flea control products in west central Florida, this study, using client-owned dogs, investigated the efficacy of lotilaner and spinosad in controlling fleas and in alleviating dermatologic signs likely associated with flea infestations. Forty-four qualifying households were randomized to either a lotilaner (Credelio®) (minimum dose rate 20 mg/kg) or a spinosad (Comfortis®) (30 mg/kg) group, with 33 and 36 dogs in each group, respectively. On Days 0 and 28 (±2) all dogs in each household were treated with the allocated product according to label directions, and all household cats received spinetoram (Cheristin®). On Day 0 and at weekly intervals through Day 56 (±2), on-animal and premises flea burdens were enumerated, a veterinary dermatologist scored integumental changes using canine atopic dermatitis extent and severity index (CADESI)-4 and flea allergy dermatitis (FAD) scales, and owners scored pruritus using the validated canine pruritus severity scale (CPSS). At study entry geometric mean flea counts were 33.2 and 29.9 in the lotilaner and spinosad groups, respectively. For both groups, reductions in flea counts were &gt; 99% at the first post-treatment assessment (Week 1), and 100% from Week 6 through the final assessment (Week 8) when all study dogs were flea-free. For both groups, at each timepoint, flea counts on dogs and in traps were significantly reduced compared to the initial assessment (p &lt; 0.001), as were improvements in median CADESI-4, FAD and CPSS scores (p ≤ 0.001). At Week 4, the geometric mean flea count on dogs in the lotilaner group (0.1) was significantly lower than that of dogs in the spinosad group (0.6) (p = 0.027), significantly fewer dogs in the lotilaner group were found to have fleas (p = 0.034), and mean owner-rated pruritus scores were significantly lower (p = 0.025). Under field conditions favoring heavy flea challenge, two consecutive monthly treatments of dogs with either lotilaner or spinosad produced a 100% reduction in canine flea infestations and dramatic improvements in dermatologic lesions and pruritus, based on scoring by a veterinary dermatologist and by dog owners. Household flea burdens were driven to extinction in all but one home in each treatment group. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The diagnosis, monitoring and flukicide efficacy testing of fasciolosis on-farm is reliant on non-terminal methods. The coproantigen ELISA (cELISA) has been recommended for diagnosis of fasciolosis and associated flukicide efficacy testing as an alternative to fluke egg counts for monitoring parasitism. Recently experimental multi-age infections have suggested that the reliability of efficacy results can be improved by a second cELISA testing at 6 weeks post-treatment (wpt) in addition to the generally accepted 1 wpt. A field study was conducted to determine the suitability of faecal fluke egg counts (FFEC) and cELISA as diagnostic, drug efficacy testing and epidemiological tools on Australian sheep and cattle farms. Faecal samples from sheep and/or cattle on three endemic farms were taken at monthly intervals for 12 months and examined by both methods. Normal farm management was maintained during the study period and opportunistic efficacy testing, in line with each farm's normal flukicide management was undertaken. Additionally, the suitability of the Ollerenshaw Index as a predictive model for fasciolosis under Australian conditions was examined. While both diagnostics demonstrated their value in the farm environment, the current data demonstrate a distinct and significant increase in diagnostic sensitivity for epidemiological studies by using the two tests in parallel. The agreement between the two diagnostics was found to be higher in cattle, despite the poor sensitivity of FFEC in this species. Similar levels of agreement between the two tests were demonstrated at both sheep properties, regardless of the marked difference in the intensity of F. hepatica challenge. Linear regression models demonstrated the results of the two diagnostics utilized in parallel were explained substantially (R2 = 0.91) as were series data (R2 = 0.88) when the respective models were fitted. In contrast, the fitted models for FFEC (R2 = 0.54) and cELISA (R2 = 0.58) were poor explanations for test outcomes. The outcomes of these models support previous findings that suggest that the two diagnostic tests are best utilized together, particularly in parallel. The application of the Ollerenshaw Index to Australian conditions requires further investigation. © 2018},

abstract={Several operating and control strategies with the purpose of manipulating the size and shape of crystals exhibiting needle-like morphology are presented using an ex situ wet mill as the actuator. A model-based operating policy and different model-free controllers are discussed. These controllers were coupled with an online particle size and shape monitoring tool. First, the attainable region in the size and shape space for a wet milling operation was evaluated in a simulation framework using a multidimensional population balance model describing the breakage phenomenon. Second, the operating and control strategies were tested experimentally in a lab-scale setup using two different milling configurations and two different compounds, namely, β l-glutamic acid and γ d-mannitol. The goal of the experiments was to drive various seed populations of the two compounds to several target average lengths in the size and shape space. It was observed that the model-based operating policy, run without any feedback action, was not able to achieve this goal for arbitrary seed populations. The model-free controllers incorporating feedback were able to do so without relying on any multidimensional breakage model. These controllers enable the robust operation of wet milling stages in complex crystal size and shape modification processes. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Platinum is a special kind of impurity in Nd-doped phosphate laser glasses. Firstly, its presence in the glass depends on the production processes, rather than the purity of the raw materials used. Secondly, there coexist Pt ion and Pt inclusion in the glass, which one is the oxidized and the other is the reduced. The detection for these two kinds of Pt impurities in the large-scale produced Nd-doped phosphate laser glasses can reflect the control level and stability of the processes. To determine more accurately the content of Pt ion in the glass, a hemi-cyanine dye, instead of SnCl2 previously used, is utilized to color Pt ion solution by dissolving the glass. On the basis of such a new hemi-cyanine spectrophotometric analysis, the factor of proportionality between Pt ion content and its absorption coefficient at 400 nm is determined and discussed. To avoid the interference from other cations in the multi-cation solution by dissolving the glass, when doing ICP-MS analysis for Pt, a magnetic poly-ionic liquid is synthesized successfully by bonding an ionic liquid to nano-Fe3O4 particles covered by C. Such a new magnetic poly-ionic liquid can adsorb Pt ions with a better selection. The element distribution of Pt, O and P for differently sized Pt inclusions in the glass is analyzed by EPMA. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Current industrial production of polymer resins is generally undertaken in large multi-tonne stirred tank reactors. These are characterised by relatively slow heating and cooling cycles, resulting in long vessel cycle times and extended production campaigns. In this work we present a design for a hybrid microwave/oil jacket proof of concept system capable of producing up to 4.1 kg of polymer resin per batch. By exploiting rapid volumetric heating effects of microwave energy at 2.45 GHz, we have optimised the synthetic regime, such that a 3.7 kg batch of polyester resin pre-polymer can be made in only 8 h 20 min, with higher molecular weight (Mn 2100) compared to the conventional process taking 22 h 15 min (Mn 1200), yielding an increase in synthesis rate of at least 265%.

abstract={Eudragit® E PO (EPO) is a terpolymer based on N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate with methylmethacrylate and butylmethacrylate, produced by Evonik Industries AG as a pharmaceutical excipient. In this work, EPO was chemically modified through reaction with acryloyl chloride. The successful modification of EPO was confirmed by FTIR, NMR-spectroscopy, elemental and thermal analysis. The degree of acrylation was determined by permanganatometric titration. The slug mucosal irritation test was used to demonstrate non-irritant nature of EPO and its acrylated derivatives (AEPO). The mucoadhesive properties of EPO and AEPO were evaluated using freshly excised sheep nasal mucosa and it was demonstrated that acrylated polymers facilitated greater retention of sodium fluorescein on mucosal surfaces compared to solution mixture of this dye solution with EPO as well as free dye. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={For CO2 capture from air on a supported amine sorbent, the effects of water co-adsorption and steam purge on the CO2 working capacity and energy requirement for CO2 desorption are studied. Working capacities are studied by fixed bed operation for changing temperature, pressure and amount of steam purge. Results show that for pressure-temperature swing adsorption a temperature above 100 °C and a pressure below 200 mbar as desorption conditions are required to maximize CO2 working capacity and reduce energy requirement for desorption. Co-adsorption of water reduces energy requirement due to an increased CO2 working capacity. Application of a steam purge increases the CO2 working capacity and hence reduces sorbent inventory required. However, the net energy requirement per kilogram CO2 does not decrease due to the latent heat of water. Concluding, steam purge regeneration for air capture does not reduce opex but might reduce capex. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={In multiphase devices, fluid dynamics have a high impact on concentration profiles and mass transfer between the phases and therefore influence efficiency. Standard models often assume ideally mixed conditions or plug flow. The application of such models for multiphase devices with complex flow patterns causes inaccuracies, if the flow deviates from ideally mixed or plug flow conditions. Therefore, for a precise model based design and operation parameter determination of devices with complex flow patterns, the local fluid dynamics should be considered. CFD simulations for multiphase systems including mass transfer, population balance equations for coalescence and breakage as well as reactions are still time consuming. Thus, we developed a compartment-model based on prior calculated CFD flow-data. In the CFD simulations, the time consuming population balance equations for coalescence and breakage, mass transfer and reactions are neglected. These phenomena are considered in the compartment-model. Thereby we reduce the overall computing time. This paper presents the CFD based compartment-model applied on a loop-reactor. First, a three-phase CFD model of the developed multiphase loop-reactor is introduced. Following, the paper presents the compartment-model and the application of a time-driven constant-number Monte-Carlo approach to solve population balances. Finally, the compartment-model is applied to the liquid-liquid extraction part of the loop-reactor calculating the drop size distribution and mass transfer based on previously calculated CFD data. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Endoglucanases are enzymes widely employed in different industrial fields, albeit with high production costs. Studies on new microbial sources and low-cost substrates are highly relevant, including those on agro-industrial. Current analysis evaluates peanut hull (PH) and sawdust (SD) as substrates for submerged cultures of 14 endophytic fungi isolated from grapevine (Vitis labrusca L.) cultivars Bordô and Concord. Endophytes were grown on a carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) medium and the cup plate assay showed that eight strains (belonging to genera Cochliobolus, Diaporthe, Fusarium and Phoma) had positive results: enzymatic halos ranged from 10.8±0.02 to 15.5±0.07 mm in diameter. Diaporthe sp. strains (GenBank accession codes KM362392, KM362368 and KM362378) and Fusarium culmorum KM362384 were highlighted as the most promising sources. Further, PH and SD as substrates for the fermentation of these fungi were evaluated by the cup plate assay and endoglucanase activity assay. Highest halo diameters were obtained for Diaporthe sp. KM362392: 16.1±0.01 mm (CMC), 14.5±0.01 mm (PH) and 14.7±0.03 mm (SD). The fungus also presented the highest levels of endoglucanase activity: analysis of variance revealed that CMC (3.52±0.98 µmol/min), PH (2.93±0.23 µmol/min) and SD (3.26±0.38 µmol/min) were similarly efficient as substrates. Results deepen knowledge on V. labrusca endophytes that may be endoglucanase sources, even though further optimizations in submerged cultures with PH and SD should be undertaken to increase the enzymatic production from these wastes. © 2019, Universidade Federal de Uberlandia.

abstract={Fractures of particle assemblies happen frequently in dense gas-solid systems leading to a notable heterogeneity in the particle configuration, especially in case of cohesive powders and non-spherical particle interlocking. In this work, we investigate the influence of such heterogeneities on the hydrodynamic drag by studying the idealized case of a random arrangement of spheres with a channel-like void region. More specifically, we introduce this heterogeneity to a homogeneous particle arrangement by shifting apart two bulk regions, such that a void channel divides particle bulk. Single-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann simulations were performed to resolve fluid flow through such arrested particle configurations and calculate the corresponding gas-particle momentum exchange and pressure drop. The calculated drag forces acting on the solids for random sphere arrangement are in good agreement with previously reported results of Hill et al. (2001b), Tenneti et al. (2011), and Tang et al. (2015). However, the overall momentum exchange obtained for configurations containing a heterogeneity is significantly lower. Obviously, the channel allows for a by-passing of a considerable amount of the flow leading to a reduced overall pressure drop and thereby underestimating the minimum fluidization velocity in a fluidized bed. Based on these direct numerical simulations, we examine the overall pressure drop dependence on the characteristic length scale (i.e. width) of the channel-like heterogeneity Lc, the superficial Reynolds number (30 ⩽ Re ⩽ 300), and the solid volume fraction in the dense (i.e. bulk) region (0.4 ⩽ϕp⩽ 0.55). The width of the channel is varied within the order of magnitude of particle diameter Dp (1 ⩽Lc/Dp⩽4.36), decreasing an overall solid volume fraction (0.25 ⩽ϕ⩽ 0.55). In addition to the numerical simulations, we derive (semi)-analytic correlations for the dense bulk region as well as for the channel. As the simulations range from laminar to transitional flow, providing a single pressure drop correlation is very challenging. Therefore, we estimate the channel pressure drop with the appropriate correlations selected according to calculated superficial Reynolds number. For laminar flow, we achieved a good agreement between a combined (i.e. bulk and channel) analytical prediction of overall pressure drop and our resolved numerical simulation. In the transitional regime, the pressure drop values are more difficult to predict, with the better agreement as we approach the turbulent regime. We believe that this work can act as a basis for the development of future drag laws accounting for channel-like sub-grid heterogeneities. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={In gas-liquid systems, bubble motion and interaction with the surrounding liquid medium serves to dramatically modify the liquid turbulent kinetic energy profile. While several two-equation bubble-induced turbulence (BIT) models have been advanced to predict this phenomenon, the intrinsic non-linearities that accompany the solution of the governing equations, interfacial forces, and turbulence models complicate their assessment. This hinders understanding of model performance and obstructs necessary model improvements. Here, the mathematical formulation of existing BIT models is investigated, and selected models are quantitatively assessed through simulation of the entire Liu (1989) air/water pipe flow experimental database in OpenFOAM. Critical to this work is the approach adopted to decouple the connection between turbulence and momentum closures, which ensures physically consistent volume fraction profiles and enables fair comparison between models. The assessment reveals that existing closures struggle with reliably predicting the turbulent kinetic energy profile as well as routinely worsen mean flow predictions. These observations are used to propose a pathway for the assembly of new BIT model formulations. © 2019},

abstract={Background and aims: Hippocampal calcification is a recently described type of intracranial calcification and might be a risk factor for ischemic stroke and dementia. Data on its risk factors and insight into the etiology are limited. We aimed to investigate the association of risk factors for hippocampal calcification in two independent cohorts in the Netherlands. Methods: Unenhanced CT scans of the brain were scored for the presence and severity of hippocampal calcification in two independent prospectively collected patient cohorts, the first consisting of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients (N = 741) and the second of patients participating in the Second Manifestation of ARTerial disease (SMART) study (N = 498). We estimated the association of the risk factors age, sex, smoking, dyslipidemia, overweight, hypertension, diabetes, family history, cardiac history, cerebrovascular history, use of vitamin K antagonists and renal disease with the presence and moderate/severe calcification using logistic regression analysis. Results: In both cohorts, age ≥60 years was associated with the presence of hippocampal calcification (odds ratio (OR) 2.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37–4.45 in SAH and OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.30–2.82 in SMART); in SMART, age was associated with moderate/severe calcification as well (OR 2.77, 96%CI 2.77 (1.36–3.65). All other risk factors, including a cumulative risk score of 5 or more risk factors, did not show any association with hippocampal calcification presence or severity. Conclusions: We identified age as a risk factor for hippocampal calcification. All other risk factors studied were not associated with hippocampal calcification. This contradicts findings on arterial calcifications elsewhere in the body. Therefore, more research is needed to understand this discrepancy. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Interleukin (IL)-17 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammation and autoimmune diseases. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a transcription factor responsible for the elimination of xenobiotic chemicals. However, it remains unknown whether AHR is involved in IL-17 signaling. Here, we demonstrate that knockdown of AHR significantly enhances, while overexpression or activation of AHR inhibits IL-17-induced inflammation in Hela cells. AHR specifically suppresses IL-17-induced p38 activation, and inhibition of p38 activity markedly reverses the effect of AHR knockdown on IL-17-induced inflammation. Mechanistically, AHR physically interacts with TAK1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3/6 (MKK3/6) and disrupts TAK1-MKK3/6 interaction, leading to impaired IL-17 signaling. Thus, our study indicates that AHR negatively regulates IL-17-mediated signaling and inflammation at least partially through interfering with the interaction between TAK1 and MKK3/6. © 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies},

abstract={Most clinical trials with combination therapy fail. One of the reasons is that not enough forethought is given to the interaction between the different agents, as well as the potential negative side-effects that may arise in the combined therapy. In the present paper we consider a generic cancer model with combination therapy consisting of chemotherapy agent X and checkpoint inhibitor A. We use a mathematical model to investigate the results of injecting different amounts γ X of X and γ A of A. We show that there are some regions in the (γA, γ X )-plane where as increase in γX or γA actually decreases the tumor volume; such ‘regions of antagonism’ should be avoided in clinical trials. We also show how to achieve the same level of tumor volume reduction with least negative-side effects, where the side-effects are represented by the level of inflammation of the tumor microenvironment. © 2019 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

abstract={In the present work, a data-driven model for identification of flow regime in a bubble column is developed by combining data from optical probe technique and machine learning. Optical probe data from previous work was combined with new data in the present work to expand the database for model development. A novel methodology for determination of two key parameters from the optical probe signal, bubble time and characteristic time of the signal, is presented. The significance of these two parameters is that they contain rich information on operating flow regime in the bubble column. A map of these two parameters for various operating conditions is created, showing points belonging to identical flow regime lie in a cluster. A machine learning methodology based on support vector analysis was developed to identify flow regime using map developed in this work. This approach was able to uniquely classify flow regimes for various experimental conditions on single map, which is the highlight of this work. © 2019},

abstract={The introduction of singular therapies, such as proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i), to lower high cholesterol levels requires better classification of patients eligible for intensive lipid lowering therapy. According to the European Medicines Administration, PCSK9i are recommended in primary prevention in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)patients. Therefore, an FH diagnosis is not simply an academic issue, because it has many clinical implications. The bases of a diagnosis of FH are not entirely clear. The availability of genetic testing, including large genome-wide association analyses and whole genome studies, has shown that some patients with a clinical diagnosis of definite FH have no mutations in the genes associated with the disease. This fact does not exclude the very high cardiovascular risk of these patients, and an early and intensive lipid lowering therapy is recommended in all FH patients. Because an FH diagnosis is a cornerstone for decisions about therapies, a precise definition of FH is urgently required. This is an expert consensus document from the Spanish Atherosclerosis Society. We propose the following classification: familial hypercholesterolemia syndrome integrated by (1)heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: patients with clinically definite FH and a functional mutation in one allele of the LDLR, ApoB:100, and PCSK9 genes; (2)homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: mutations affect both alleles; (3)polygenic familial hypercholesterolemia: patients with clinically definite FH but no mutations associated with FH are found (to be distinguished from non-familial, multifactorial hypercholesterolemia); (4)familial hypercholesterolemia combined with hypertriglyceridemia: a subgroup of familial combined hyperlipidaemia patients fulfilling clinically definite FH with associated hypertriglyceridemia. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Solid sponges provide large surface areas, low pressure drops, and excellent heat transport properties and are thus promising monolithic catalyst carriers. Their potential compared to randomly packed beds at industrial scales, however, is largely unknown. To facilitate scale-up and future simulation studies, we present a 2-d mulstiscale reactor model for catalytic sponges. Therefore, we couple a 2-d pseudo-homogeneous reactor model with a 1-d reaction–diffusion model to explicitly consider heat and mass transfer and diffusional limitations at the catalyst scale. A comparison of simulated temperature profiles with experimental ones during CO2 methanation at the lab scale demonstrates the validity of the developed model. Further, the results show that it is necessary to include heat and mass transport at the catalyst scale to adequately simulate concentration and temperature distributions in solid sponges although the applied catalyst layers are typically thinner than 100 μm. The presented model thus allows to obtain insights into the interplay between heat and mass transport at both, the reactor and the catalyst scale, and provides a solid foundation for scale-up and techno-economic studies to assess the performance of solid sponges as catalyst carrier at industrial scales. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)levels is associated with a well-documented reduction in cardiovascular (CV)disease (CVD)risk. Current guidelines and literature support lifestyle interventions as the primary strategy for reducing CV risk. Association of dietary modifications (such as the Mediterranean diet), physical activity and the cessation of smoking with reduced CV morbidity and mortality has been evidenced. Where lifestyle interventions are not adequate for lowering LDL-C levels and CV risk, pharmacological therapies, most commonly statins, may also be considered. The benefits of lifestyle and pharmacological interventions in the prevention of CVD are widely known, but poor adherence and persistence to these necessitate an approach that aims to improve LDL-C lowering for CVD prevention. Nutraceuticals (targeted functional foods or dietary supplements of plant or microbial origin)are included in EU guidelines as lifestyle interventions and may provide an additional approach to controlling LDL-C levels when a pharmaceutical intervention is not (yet)indicated. However, among different nutraceuticals, the level of clinical evidence supportive of efficacy for lipid lowering needs to be considered. Meta-analyses of randomised clinical trials have demonstrated that some nutraceuticals (e.g. red yeast rice and berberine)and some nutraceutical combinations improve lipid profiles, including lowering of LDL-C, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Therefore, nutraceuticals may be considered in specific patient groups where there is appropriate evidence to support the efficacy and safety. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Technical ceramics are being widely employed in the electric power, medical and engineering industries because of their thermal and mechanical properties, as well as their high resistance qualities. The manufacture of technical ceramic components involves complex processes, including milling and stirring of raw materials in aqueous solutions, spray drying and dry pressing. In general, the spray-dried powders exhibit an important degree of variability in their performance when subjected to dry-pressing, which affects the efficiency of the manufacturing process. Commercial additives, such as deflocculants, biocides, antifoam agents, binders, lubricants and plasticizers are thus applied to ceramic slips. Several bacterial and fungal species naturally occurring in ceramic raw materials, such as Sphingomonas, Aspergillus and Aureobasidium, are known to produce exopolysaccharides. These extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) may confer unique and potentially interesting properties on ceramic slips, including viscosity control, gelation, and flocculation. In this study, the microbial communities present in clay raw materials were identified by both culture methods and DNA-based analyses to select potential EPS producers based on the scientific literature for further assays based on the use of EPS for enhancing the performance of technical ceramics. Potential exopolysaccharide producers were identified in all samples, such as Sphingomonas sp., Pseudomonas xanthomarina, P. stutzeri, P. koreensis, Acinetobacter lwoffi, Bacillus altitudinis and Micrococcus luteus, among bacteria. Five fungi (Penicillium citrinum, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum, Acremonium persicinum and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa) were also identified as potential EPS producers. © 2019, MDPI AG.

abstract={Chalcogenide glasses have attracted much attention for the realization of photonic components owing to their outstanding optical properties in the mid-infrared (MIR) region. However, relatively few refractive index dispersion data are presently available for these glasses at MIR wavelengths. This paper presents a mini review of methods we have both used and developed to determine the refractive indices and thermo-optic coefficients of chalcogenide glasses at MIR wavelengths, and is supported by new results. The mini review should be useful to both new and established researchers in the chalcogenide glass field and fields of MIR optics, fiber-optics and waveguides. Three groups of methods are distinguished: (1) spectroscopic ellipsometry, (2) prism-based methods, and (3) methods using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) transmission data. The mini review is supported by a brief discussion of refractive index models. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Bismuth is a non-toxic posttransition metal with a large number of possible valence states which, together with to its tendency to form clusters, make it a versatile but complex dopant for possible luminescence applications. The outer orbitals responsible for luminescence are unshielded and strongly influenced by the surrounding environment, so that their energies are host dependent. In this review article we surveyed models that have been developed to understand the optical properties of bismuth based materials and compiled a few case studies on the luminescence of bismuth doped materials, with some emphasis on trivalent Bi3+ and simple oxide hosts (e.g. CaO:Bi; Y2O3:Bi; ZnO:Bi; La2O3:Bi; SrO:Bi; YPO4:Bi and LaPO4:Bi). Special emphasis was given to the compilation of simplified energy diagrams under different conditions. For the most stable trivalent Bi3+ state it has been experimentally found by many researchers that the absorption spectra consist of medium, weak and strong bands in order of increasing energy (designated the A, B and C bands, respectively), which were interpreted in terms of transitions to the states associated with the 3P1, 3P2 and 1P1 levels of the excited 6s1p1 configuration. Traditionally above the C band energy, but before the host absorption, a further D band is generally encountered, which is attributed to a metal-to-metal charge transfer (MMCT) transition corresponding to the transfer of an electron from the Bi3+ ion to the bottom of the conduction band. Recent modelling of this MMCT band in different materials has clarified that it may occur at energies below the C band and be an important influence on excitation spectra at lower energies. The challenge of unambiguously identifying the nature of emissions is still an ongoing challenge, as illustrated by some of the case studies. © 2019 The Author(s)},

Cellulose-based fabrics released more microfibers (0.2–4 mg/g fabric) during accelerated laundering than polyester (0.1–1 mg/g fabric). Using well-controlled aquatic biodegradation experiments it was shown that cotton and rayon microfibers are expected to degrade in natural aquatic aerobic environments whereas polyester microfibers are expected to persist in the environment for long periods of time. © 2019},

abstract={In this paper, we present a number of key numerical methods that can be used to study elongated particles in fluid flows, with a specific emphasis on fluidised beds. Fluidised beds are frequently used for the production of biofuels, bioenergy, and other products from biomass particles, which often have an approximate elongated shape. This raises numerous issues in a numerical approach such as particle-particle contact detection and the accurate description of the various hydrodynamic forces, such as drag, lift, and torque, that elongated particles experience when moving in a fluid flow. The modelling is further complicated by a separation of length scales where industrial flow structures that can extend for many metres evolve subject to solid-solid and solid-fluid interactions at the millimetre scale. As a result, it is impossible to simulate both length scales using the same numerical approach, and a multiscale approach is necessary. First, we outline the direct numerical simulation (DNS) approach that may be employed to estimate hydrodynamic force closures for elongated particles in a fluid flow. We then describe the key aspects of a CFD-DEM approach, which can be used to simulate laboratory scale fluidisation processes, that must be addressed to study elongated particles. Finally, we briefly consider how current industrial-scale models, which concretely assume particle sphericity, could be adapted for the simulation of large collections of elongated particles subject to fluidisation. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Plants are exposed to diverse abiotic stresses like drought, heat, salinity, and high-metal concentrations at different stages of their life cycle. As protection against stress, plants release signaling molecules that initiate a cascade of stress-adaptation responses leading either to programmed cell death or plant acclimation. Nitric oxide (NO) is a small but important redox signaling molecule that in plants is involved in a diverse range of physiological processes including germination, development, flowering, senescence, and abiotic stress. Although the exact role of NO in plants remains unclear and is species dependent, various studies have suggested a positive correlation between NO accumulations in stress in plants. In this article, we review and discuss the biosynthesis of NO, sources and exogenous application of NO donors under drought, salt, and heavy metal stress. A review of publications indicated that, in general, application of exogenous NO alleviates the negative stress effects in plants and improves antioxidant activity in most plant species. In addition, S-nitrosylation and tyrosine nitration are two NO-mediated posttranslational modification. All these factors are important in protecting plants from diverse stresses and vary with the species. Furthermore, to determine precise mechanisms of action of NO is expected to help in efficient utilization of crop cultivation under stress conditions. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={In recent years, natural polysaccharides have received increasing attention and become one type of popular dietary nutrient because of their various biological functions. In this paper, the sources, extraction, purification and structural characterization methods of natural polysaccharides are introduced. Natural polysaccharides are favorable for the proliferation of short chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, the presence of which can improve the intestinal microenvironment. Natural polysaccharides can not only enhance immunity, but also suppress excessive immune responses caused by various stimuli. In particular, natural polysaccharides can regulate immunity by acting directly on the immune cells and targeting the gut microbiota. Natural polysaccharides can enhance immunity by promoting beneficial microorganisms and strengthening the function of immune cells. However, natural polysaccharides can also suppress excessive inflammatory responses by improving the intestinal microbiota composition, strengthening intestinal barrier function, enhancing antioxidant activities, promoting SCFA production and reducing pro-inflammatory mediators. Therefore, a comprehensive review is presented on the impacts of natural polysaccharides on the gut microbiota and immune responses, as well as their interactions. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) participate from the initial phases of cancer onset to the settlement of a metastatic niche in a second organ. Their role in cancer progression is related to their involvement in the extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and in the regulation and processing of adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins, growth factors, chemokines and cytokines. MMPs participation in cancer progression makes them an attractive target for cancer therapy. MMPs have also been used for theranostic purposes in the detection of primary tumor and metastatic tissue in which a particular MMP is overexpressed, to follow up on therapy responses, and in the activation of cancer cytotoxic pro-drugs as part of nano-delivery-systems that increase drug concentration in a specific tumor target.

abstract={Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)cholesterol (LDL-C)is the primary target in cardiovascular (CV)disease prevention and is commonly used in estimating CV risk; however, alternative markers may be needed when LDL-C is not an appropriate marker (e.g. in the presence of low LDL-C levels or elevated triglyceride [TG]levels). Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C)and apolipoprotein B (apoB)are markers of atherogenic lipoproteins with evidenced associations with CV risk and are, therefore, recommended as secondary targets, appropriate for use in the presence of elevated TG levels. The reported strength of the associations of non-HDL-C and apoB in comparison to LDL-C is conflicting between studies, potentially due to discordance of the markers which can alter their predictive pattern. Although LDL-C levels are commonly managed with statin treatment, a residual risk of CV events still remains, and an abnormal lipid profile can persist. Combination therapy to further reduce LDL-C levels can be beneficial; a statin therapy combined with other LDL-C-lowering therapy further reduced the number of CV events. In addition, targeting other markers, including non-HDL-C, apoB, total cholesterol and TGs may also be beneficial, specifically in patients with low HDL-C and elevated TG levels. More clinical evidence is required before definitive recommendations can be made; however, a statin–fenofibrate combination demonstrated favourable reductions in major CV events in these specific patients. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs responsible for regulating 40% to 60% of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. The discovery of circulating microRNAs in several biological fluids opened the path for their study as biomarkers and long-range cell-to-cell communication mediators. Their transfer between individuals in the case of blood transfusion, for example, and their high enrichment in milk have sparked the interest for microRNA transfer through diet, especially from mothers to infants during breastfeeding. The extension of such paradigm led to the study of milk microRNAs in the case of cow or goat milk consumption in adults. Here we provide a comprehensive critical review of the key findings surrounding milk microRNAs in human, cow, and goat milk among other species. We discuss the data on their biological properties, their use as disease biomarkers, their transfer between individuals or species, and their putative or verified functions in health and disease of infants and adult consumers. This work is based on all the literature available and integrates all the results, theories, debates, and validation studies available so far on milk microRNAs and related areas of investigations. We critically discuss the limitations and outline future aspects and avenues to explore in this rapidly growing field of research that could impact public health through infant milk formulations or new therapies. We hope that this comprehensive review of the literature will provide insight for all teams investigating milk RNAs’ biological activities and help ensure the quality of future reports. © 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®},

abstract={A group of experts convened by the Spanish Society of Arteriosclerosis (SEA) has been in charge of updating the SEA document on the indications of PCSK9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) in clinical practice that was published in 2016. This update is justified by the fact that the data from clinical trials carried out on a large scale with PCSK9i have shown that in addition to their high potency to lower atherogenic cholesterol, they reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, both in patients with stable disease, and with recent disease, and with a high degree of security. This update provides the recommendations and level of evidence for the prescription of iPCSK9 in patients with homozygous and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and in primary prevention in patients with very high cardiovascular risk. These recommendations have been established taking into account the concentration of LDL-C, the clinical situation of the patient, the additional risk factors and the cost-effectiveness of their use. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={A key strategy in preventing cardiovascular (CV) disease is the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Statins are a crucial therapy for achieving LDL-C reductions, with the highest tolerated dose often prescribed, especially for patients who are at the greatest risk of CV disease. However, statin intolerance, heterogeneous responses to statins and non-adherence make alternative therapies necessary in some cases. Statins can be combined with a multitude of therapies with synergistic mechanisms of action to effectively manage lipid profiles, while improving safety and tolerability profiles. Addition of a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, bile acid sequestrant or fibrate to statin therapy leads to greater numbers of patients achieving and maintaining LDL-C goals. Furthermore, combination therapies can alter the plasma profiles of other molecules involved in hypercholesterolaemia, including triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. An additional strategy is proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition therapy, for use in patients who are statin intolerant, patients with heterozygous or homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, and patients at very high CV risk, as a potential means for achieving large LDL-C reductions and maintaining LDL-C goals. Clinical trials have demonstrated that PCSK9 inhibition therapy is not only effective but can also be combined with statin therapy to ensure greater reductions in LDL-C. Current, ongoing studies are investigating the efficacy of novel therapies, including selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha modulators, PCSK9-specific ribonucleic acid (RNA) interference and anti-inflammatory therapies. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={The increasing global demand for farmland products is placing unprecedented pressure on the global agricultural system and its water resources. Many regions of the world, that are affected by a chronic water scarcity relative to their population, strongly depend on the import of agricultural commodities and associated embodied (or virtual) water. The globalization of water through virtual water trade (VWT) is leading to a displacement of water use and a disconnection between human populations and the water resources they rely on. Despite the recognized importance of these phenomena in reshaping the patterns of water dependence through teleconnections between consumers and producers, their effect on global and regional water resources has just started to be quantified. This review investigates the global spatiotemporal dynamics, drivers, and impacts of VWT through an integrated analysis of surface water, groundwater, and root-zone soil moisture consumption for agricultural production; it evaluates how virtual water flows compare to the major 'physical water fluxes' in the Earth System; and provides a new reconceptualization of the hydrologic cycle to account also for the role of water redistribution by the hidden 'virtual water cycle'. © 2019 The Author(s).

abstract={Marine photosynthetic organisms emit organic gases, including the polyolefins isoprene (C 5 H 8 ) and monoterpenes (MTPs, C 10 H 16 ), into the boundary layer. Their atmospheric processing produces particles that influence cloud formation and growth and, as a result, the Earth's radiation balance. Here, we report that the heterogeneous ozonolysis of dissolved α-pinene by O 3 (g) on aqueous surfaces is dramatically accelerated by I - , an anion enriched in the ocean upper microlayer and sea spray aerosols (SSAs). In our experiments, liquid microjets of α-pinene solutions, with and without added I - , are dosed with O 3 (g) for τ &lt; 10 μs and analyzed online by pneumatic ionization mass spectrometry. In the absence of I - , α-pinene does not detectably react with O 3 (g) under present conditions. In the presence of ≥ 0.01 mM I - , in contrast, new signals appear at m/z = 169 (C 9 H 13 O 3 - ), m/z = 183 (C 10 H 15 O 3 - ), m/z = 199 (C 10 H 15 O 4 - ), m/z = 311 (C 10 H 16 IO 3 - ), and m/z = 461 (C 20 H 30 IO 4 - ), plus m/z = 175 (IO 3 - ), and m/z = 381 (I 3 - ). Collisional fragmentation splits CO 2 from C 9 H 13 O 3 - , C 10 H 15 O 3 - and C 10 H 15 O 4 - , and I - plus IO - from C 10 H 16 IO 3 - as expected from a trioxide IOOO ° C 10 H 16 - structure. We infer that the oxidative processing of α-pinene on aqueous surfaces is significantly accelerated by I - via the formation of IOOO - intermediates that are more reactive than O 3 . A mechanism in which IOOO - reacts with α-pinene (and likely with other unsaturated species) in competition with its isomerization to IO 3 - accounts for present results and the fact that soluble iodine in SSA is mostly present as iodine-containing organic species rather than the thermodynamically more stable iodate. By this process, a significant fraction of biogenic MTPs and other unsaturated gases may be converted to water-soluble species rather than emitted to the atmosphere. © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Glassy silicates are substantially weaker when in contact with aqueous electrolyte solutions than in vacuum due to chemical interactions with preexisting cracks. To investigate this silicate weakening phenomenon, classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of silica fracture were performed using the bond-order based, reactive force field ReaxFF. Four different environmental conditions were investigated: vacuum, water, and two salt solutions (1M NaCl, 1M NaOH) that form relatively acidic and basic solutions, respectively. Any aqueous environment weakens the silica, with NaOH additions resulting in the largest decreases in the effective fracture toughness (eKIC) of silica or the loading rate at which the fracture begins to propagate. The basic solution leads to higher surface deprotonation, narrower radius of curvature of the crack tip, and greater weakening of the silica, compared with the more acidic environment. The results from the two different electrolyte solutions correspond to phenomena observed in experiments and provide a unique atomistic insight into how anions alter the chemical-mechanical fracture response of silica. © 2019 Rimsza, Jones and Criscenti.},

abstract={During the past twenty years, the Nordic countries (Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway) have introduced a range of measures to reduce losses of nitrogen (N) to air and to aquatic environment by leaching and runoff. However, the agricultural sector is still an important N source to the environment, and projections indicate relatively small emission reductions in the coming years. The four Nordic countries have different priorities and strategies regarding agricultural N flows and mitigation measures, and therefore they are facing different challenges and barriers. In Norway farm subsidies are used to encourage measures, but these are mainly focused on phosphorus (P). In contrast, Denmark targets N and uses control regulations to reduce losses. In Sweden and Finland, both voluntary actions combined with subsidies help to mitigate both N and P. The aim of this study was to compare the present situation pertaining to agricultural N in the Nordic countries as well as to provide recommendations for policy instruments to achieve cost effective abatement of reactive N from agriculture in the Nordic countries, and to provide guidance to other countries. To further reduce N losses from agriculture, the four countries will have to continue to take different routes. In particular, some countries will need new actions if 2020 and 2030 National Emissions Ceilings Directive (NECD) targets are to be met. Many options are possible, including voluntary action, regulation, taxation and subsidies, but the difficulty is finding the right balance between these policy options for each country. The governments in the Nordic countries should put more attention to the NECD and consult with relevant stakeholders, researchers and farmer's associations on which measures to prioritize to achieve these goals on time. It is important to pick remaining low hanging fruits through use of the most cost effective mitigation measures. We suggest that N application rate and its timing should be in accordance with the crop need and carrying capacity of environmental recipients. Also, the choice of application technology can further reduce the risk of N losses into air and waters. This may require more region-specific solutions and knowledge-based support with tailored information in combination with further targeted subsidies or regulations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={There is significant overlap between the cellular and molecular mechanisms of aging and pathways contributing to carcinogenesis, including the role of genome maintenance pathways. In the field of geroscience analysis of novel genetic mouse models with either a shortened, or an extended, lifespan provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the synergistic roles of longevity assurance pathways in cancer resistance and regulation of lifespan and to develop novel targets for interventions that both delay aging and prevent carcinogenesis. There is a growing need for robust assays to assess the susceptibility of cancer in these models. The present review focuses on a well-characterized method frequently used in cancer research, which can be adapted to study resilience to genotoxic stress and susceptibility to genotoxic stress-induced carcinogenesis in geroscience research namely, chemical carcinogenesis induced by treatment with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA). Recent progress in understanding how longer-living mice may achieve resistance to chemical carcinogenesis and how these pathways are modulated by anti-aging interventions is reviewed. Strain-specific differences in sensitivity to DMBA-induced carcinogenesis are also explored and contrasted with mouse lifespan. The clinical relevance of inhibition of DMBA-induced carcinogenesis for the pathogenesis of mammary adenocarcinomas in older human subjects is discussed. Finally, the potential role of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in the regulation of pathways responsible for cellular resilience to DMBA-induced mutagenesis is discussed. © 2019, American Aging Association.},

abstract={Films of titanate nanosheets (approx. 1.8-nm layer thickness and 200-nm size) having a lamellar structure can form electrolyte-filled semi-permeable channels containing tetrabutylammonium cations. By evaporation of a colloidal solution, persistent deposits are readily formed with approx. 10-μm thickness on a 6-μm-thick poly(ethylene-terephthalate) (PET) substrate with a 20-μm diameter microhole. When immersed in aqueous solution, the titanate nanosheets exhibit a p.z.c. of − 37 mV, consistent with the formation of a cation conducting (semi-permeable) deposit. With a sufficiently low ionic strength in the aqueous electrolyte, ionic current rectification is observed (cationic diode behaviour). Currents can be dissected into (i) electrolyte cation transport, (ii) electrolyte anion transport and (iii) water heterolysis causing additional proton transport. For all types of electrolyte cations, a water heterolysis mechanism is observed. For Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ ions, water heterolysis causes ion current blocking, presumably due to localised hydroxide-induced precipitation processes. Aqueous NBu 4 + is shown to ‘invert’ the diode effect (from cationic to anionic diode). Potential for applications in desalination and/or ion sensing are discussed.

abstract={Background and aims: We aimed to understand the risk factors associated with incomplete vaccination, which may help to identify and prioritise opportunities to intervene. Methods: Consenting parents of children <6 years old attending an outpatient clinic completed a questionnaire, which captured demographic information and their level of agreement with belief statements about vaccination using a 7-point Likert scale. Vaccination status was determined from the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register and deemed either “complete” (no doses overdue) or “incomplete” (1 or more doses overdue) at the time of questionnaire completion. Results: Of 589 children of respondents, 116 (20%) had an incomplete vaccination status. Of these, nearly two-thirds (63%) of parents believed that their child was, in fact, fully-vaccinated. Compared to those with a complete vaccine status, children with an incomplete vaccine status were more likely to be born overseas (p < 0.001), have a larger family size (p = 0.02) and to have parents with lower educational attainment (p = 0.001). Parents of children with an incomplete status reported more doubt about the importance of vaccination and greater concern about vaccine safety, compared to parents of children with a complete status. Conclusion: Most parents are supportive of vaccination. Sociodemographic factors may contribute more to the risk of incomplete vaccination than attitudes or beliefs. Some parents are unaware of their child's vaccination status, suggesting that simple and modern reminders may assist parents to keep up to date. © 2019},

abstract={Background: Strengthening immunisation programmes in Africa remains a key strategy of improving vaccine coverage. Research plays a vital role in the design and implementation of strategic immunisation plans for improving vaccination coverage, in turn providing context specific evidence to inform policy and practice. We therefore updated an evidence map describing the types and quality of available literature on childhood immunisation in Africa from 2011 to 2017. Methods: PubMed and Africa Wide databases were searched for English studies on childhood immunisation in Africa published from January 2011 to September 2017. Studies had to be conducted in humans and the reported information needed to be on either: vaccines; immunisation programmes; immunisation policies; or epidemiology of vaccine preventable diseases targeted by Expanded Programme on Immunisation vaccines. Results: Out of 5567 studies retrieved, 797 studies from 165 journals met the inclusion criteria. During 2011–2017, 42 African countries contributed to research on childhood immunisation. Most studies were carried out in multiple countries (15.1%). Five countries contributed 41% of the total research output. Nigeria and South Africa contributed the highest proportion of studies at 12% and 11.4% respectively. The quantity of research output increased progressively from 2011 to 2015 after which there was a significant decline. Conclusion: There was a remarkable increase in childhood immunisation research in the period 2011 to 2017 when compared to the initial assessment. However, the reason for decline in research output from 2015 requires further investigation. Most childhood immunisation research was still generated by five countries as previously observed, highlighting the critical need for strategic investment in research capacities and improved collaboration between countries in Africa. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={Background: We report on an outbreak of hepatitis A among men who have sex with men (MSM) in England and its associated healthcare resource burden, the strategies used to control the outbreak and the role of past and current hepatitis A vaccination policy and practice in England. Methods: National surveillance of hepatitis A, including reference laboratory confirmation and molecular sequencing, and a case questionnaire, was enhanced in 2017 to collect demographic and risk information, disease severity and healthcare utilisation. National Health Service (NHS) data was used to calculate associated healthcare costs. Results: During the outbreak period (July 2016 to January 2018), 670 confirmed cases were identified in England, caused by three distinct viral strains. The public health response included raising public and professional awareness, reinforcing vaccine recommendations for MSM, contact tracing for post-exposure vaccination, and mass community vaccination where spill-over of infection into the general population occurred. Hepatitis A vaccine was centrally procured to ensure sexual health clinics in England could offer vaccination to MSM. Outbreak associated healthcare costs were estimated to be approximately £1,500,000. Conclusions: While MSM are at increased risk of hepatitis A infection, inconsistent implementation of MSM vaccination policy in previous years led to an increasingly susceptible MSM population. The large number of cases, hospital admission rate and public health actions contributed to a significant healthcare burden. Recommending hepatitis A vaccination for MSM and clarifying commissioning responsibilities is essential to prevent future outbreaks. © 2019},

abstract={Background: Vaccination history may confound estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) when two conditions are present: (1) Influenza vaccination is associated with vaccination history and (2) vaccination modifies the risk of natural infection in the following seasons, either due to persisting vaccination immunity or due to lower previous risk of natural infection. Methods: Analytic arguments are used to define conditions for confounding of VE estimates by vaccination history. Simulation studies, both with accurate and inaccurate assessment of current and previous vaccination status, are used to explore the potential magnitude of these biases when using different statistical models to address confounding by vaccination history. Results: We found a potential for substantial bias of VE estimates by vaccination history if infection- and/or vaccination-derived immunity persisted from one season to the next and if vaccination uptake in individuals was seasonally correlated. Full adjustment by vaccination history, which is usually not feasible, resulted in unbiased VE estimates. Partial adjustment, i.e. only by prior season's vaccination status, significantly reduced confounding bias. Misclassification of vaccination status, which can also lead to substantial bias, interferes with the adjustment of VE estimates for vaccination history. Conclusions: Confounding by vaccination history may bias VE estimates, but even partial adjustment by only the prior season's vaccination status substantially reduces confounding bias. Misclassification of vaccination status may compromise VE estimates and efforts to adjust for vaccination history. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={In recent years, vaccination rates in the Netherlands have declined slightly, but steadily. The Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) commissioned a Committee for Vaccine Willingness (VWC) to study the societal context of the decline. One of the societal contexts is the Internet, where audiences discuss vaccination and refer to sources of health-related information of varying quality. Working for the VWC, we have explored the Dutch vaccination debate on Twitter in order to: (1) identify online communities in the vaccination debate, (2) identify vaccine-related narratives; and (3) understand how the online communities interact with each other. We identified seven different communities, including (public) health professionals, writers and journalists, anti-establishment, and international vaccination advocates. The debate is spearheaded by the writers & journalists community, while the health- and anti-establishment communities try to influence it. The health community circulates facts, figures and scientific studies, while negative messages about vaccination – either from a homeopathy or conspiracy perspective – are most prevalent in the anti-establishment. The facts and figures shared by the health community hardly reach other communities, whereas the myths introduced by the anti-establishment do spill over to other communities. Our study provides further evidence that negative perceptions about vaccination might be rooted in a wider sentiment of distrust of traditional institutions. We argue that Dutch health organizations should try to address questions, doubts, and worries among the general audience more actively, and present scientific information in a simpler and more attractive way. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Introduction: A number of national/multi-national networks provide annual estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) based on the test-negative design. Most of these networks use subject self-reports to define influenza vaccination history. In this study, we used simulations to estimate the degree to which self-reported vaccination status can bias test-negative VE estimates. Methods: We simulated a population whose members are at risk for acute respiratory illness (ARI) due to influenza and for ARI due to other respiratory pathogens. Vaccination was assumed to reduce the risk of influenza but not of non-influenza ARI. We simulated a range of possible values for VE and for vaccine coverage. Across simulations, we varied the sensitivity and specificity of self-reported vaccination status relative to true vaccination. We estimated bias as the percent difference in VE in the presence of misclassification relative to true simulated VE. Results: Assuming self-report has sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90%, estimated VE underestimated true VE by 16% (95% confidence interval, 4–30%). Decreasing specificity of self-reports resulted in greater bias than decreasing sensitivity of self-reports. Bias also increased as vaccine coverage decreased. Conclusions: The use of self-reported influenza vaccination history can meaningfully bias influenza VE in test-negative studies. Researchers using test-negative designs should attempt to supplement or validate self-reported vaccination history using additional data sources. © 2018},

abstract={Immortalized cell lines used to produce vaccines are expected to be described in terms of their tumorigenicity. However, current in vivo tumorigenicity assays can be time-consuming and results can be equivocal, especially for weakly tumorigenic cells. Basement membrane extract (BME) derived from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse tumor, such as Matrigel and Cultrex, consists of laminin, collagen IV, entactin, heparan sulfate, and proteoglycans, as well as biologically active peptides and growth factors. For nearly three decades, BME has been used in cancer research to enhance tumorigenicity assays (both tumor “take” as well as tumor growth are substantially improved). We assessed the feasibility of using BME to facilitate the evaluation of vaccine cell substrate tumorigenicity. Vero cells (WHO 10-87) were serially passaged and banked at every ten passages beginning with p140; for the present study, low-passage Vero cells (Vero LP, originating from cells banked at p140) and high-passage Vero cells (Vero HP, originating from cells banked at p250) were used. In addition, Vero TPX2 and Vero NM1, cell lines established from tumors formed in nude mice by Vero HP cells, as well as other cell lines relevant to vaccine production (HeLa, MDCK, 293, and ARPE-19), were assessed. Female adult athymic nude mice were injected subcutaneously with cells in the absence or presence of BME. We observed that the tumorigenicity of ARPE-19 cells as well as Vero cells below passage 258 (Vero LP and Vero HP; previously characterized as non-tumorigenic or weakly tumorigenic, respectively) was not enhanced by BME. In contrast, BME shortened the latency and decreased the tumor-producing cell dose of HeLa, 293, and MDCK cells as well as the tumorigenic Vero derivatives TPX2 and NM1. Thus, responsiveness to BME may reflect the status of the neoplastic process and possibly serve as a useful trait for better defining the tumorigenic phenotype of cells. © 2019},

abstract={Background: The monovalent oral rotavirus vaccine Rotarix® was introduced into the UK infant immunisation programme in 2013. We estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the first two years of the programme. Methods: We used a test-negative case-control design and enhanced national surveillance data for 1869 vaccine-eligible children tested for rotavirus infection to obtain adjusted odds ratios and VE against laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infections. Linked anonymised UK primary care and hospitalisation data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (40,723 children) and random-effects Poisson regression were used in a cohort study to estimate VE against all-cause acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and AGE hospitalisations. Results: VE against laboratory-confirmed infection was 69% (95% Confidence Interval: 40–84%) for one dose and 77% (95%CI: 66–85%) for two doses. Two-dose VE in children aged <12 months and ≥12 months was 85% (95%CI: 74–91%) and 54% (95%CI: 15–75%), respectively. In contrast, we found no evidence that the vaccine was effective against all-cause AGE (VE = −20%, 95%CI: −36% to −5%), or against AGE hospitalisations (VE = 35%, 95% CI: −86% to 77%). Conclusions: In this first detailed assessment of VE of the Rotarix® vaccine in the English national programme, we show that Rotarix® was highly effective in preventing laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infection in young children. This provides reassurance about the vaccine's performance in real-life settings and gives key information for future cost-effectiveness analyses. The high VE against rotavirus-specific AGE, and the exceptionally successful implementation of the national rotavirus vaccine programme (with >90% vaccine coverage), explains the lack of VE against all-cause AGE because most AGE in the post-vaccine era would not have been due to rotavirus, although some underestimation of VE could also have occurred due to differential healthcare utilisation by vaccinated and unvaccinated infants. This highlights the importance of using specific vaccine-preventable endpoints for these scenarios. © 2019},

abstract={Background: Pertussis disease rates are high in Switzerland, especially in infants and young infants. To protect newborns from this serious disease, EKIF, the Swiss National Immunization Technical Advisory Group, has recommended vaccination against pertussis during pregnancy (2nd or 3rd trimester) since 2013. Also, since 2009, EKIF has recommended vaccination against influenza during pregnancy. We conducted this study to assess acceptance and implementation of these recently introduced recommendations. Methods: We performed standardized interviews with parents of children born on or after 01.01.2013, hospitalized at the University of Basel Children's Hospital, Switzerland, between January and June 2017. If participation was declined, partial consent was sought for four questions regarding age, education level, attitudes towards vaccinations in general and availability of vaccination records. Results: In 193 of 398 eligible children the mother participated. Five (3%) of 172 mothers had received both pertussis and influenza vaccines during pregnancy, 15 (9%) only against pertussis and 12 (7%) only against influenza. Very few mothers had received vaccination recommendation during pregnancy: 17 (10%) for both pertussis and influenza and 15 (9%) each for pertussis and influenza only. Main reasons for refusal of vaccination despite recommendation were that they were not deemed useful (59% for influenza and 37% for pertussis) and safety concerns for the child (18% for influenza and 26% for pertussis). Conclusions: Recommendation for and immunization rates against pertussis and influenza during pregnancy are low and need to be improved. As recommendations from health care personnel have been shown to have the most significant impact on immunization rates, we propose to focus on improving awareness and acceptance for immunization in pregnancy among health care personnel involved in the care of pregnant women. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The tumor necrosis factor receptor associated protein 1 (TRAP1) is a mitochondria chaperon protein that has been previously implicated as a target for cancer therapy due to its expression level is linked to tumor progression. In this study, an immunodominant phosphopeptide of TRAP1 was identified from an HLA-A2 gene transfected mouse cancer cell line using mass spectrometry, and a synthetic phosphopeptide was generated to evaluate the potency on cancer immunotherapy. In the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) deficient cell, the conjugated phosphate group plays a critical role to enhance the binding affinity of phosphopeptide with HLA-A2 molecule. On the basis of immunological assay, immunization of synthetic phosphopeptide could induce a high frequency of IFN-γ-secreting CD8 + T cells in HLA-A2 transgenic mice, and the stimulated cytotoxic T lymphocytes showed a high target specificity to lysis the epitope-pulsed splenocytes in vivo and the human lung cancer cell in vitro. In a tumor challenge assay, vaccination of the HLA-A2 restricted phosphopeptide appeared to suppress the tumor growth and prolong the survival period of tumor-bearing mice.

abstract={Background: The United Kingdom introduced routine vaccination with the live-attenuated zoster vaccine for 70 year-olds in 2013, with the vaccine also offered to 79 year-olds as part of a catch-up campaign. In the subsequent years, the catch-up campaign was extended to also include adults aged 78 years. We investigated 14 pre-identified potential risk factors for potential modified vaccine effectiveness. Methods: This retrospective cohort study in England included subjects born in 1943–1946 (the routine cohort) and in 1934–1937 (the catch-up cohort). We used the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to identify herpes zoster (HZ) cases and the risk factors: age, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status, asthma, type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, body mass index, immunosuppression, history of HZ, co-administration with influenza or pneumococcal vaccine. We derived HZ incidence by risk groups, overall vaccine effectiveness (VE) and modified VE expressed as relative differences in VE from Poisson regression models. Results: Overall VE was 66.8% [95% CI: 62.2; 71.0]. Two out of the 14 investigated risk factors modified the HZ VE. Notably, lower VE was observed in diabetics and in persons with a history of HZ with relative differences in VE of –22·2%, [95% CI: −39·6, −4·5] and –22·5%, [95% CI: −44·9, −0·1]. Conclusions: Live-attenuated zoster vaccine protection against HZ was lower in type 2 diabetics and in subjects with a history of HZ. Contrary to clinical trial results, age did not affect the observed VE. Further study is required to gain insights into why certain risk groups are less protected. Identifying and understanding the effect modifiers of VE is important for future vaccine development as well as vaccine recommendations. © 2019},

abstract={Rabies has profound public health, social and economic impacts on developing countries, with an estimated 59,000 annual human rabies deaths globally. Mass dog vaccination is effective at eliminating the disease but remains challenging to achieve in India due to the high proportion of roaming dogs that cannot be readily handled for parenteral vaccination. Two methods for the vaccination of dogs that could not be handled for injection were compared in Goa, India; the oral bait handout (OBH) method, where teams of two travelled by scooter offering dogs an empty oral bait construct, and the catch-vaccinate-release (CVR) method, where teams of seven travel by supply vehicle and use nets to catch dogs for parenteral vaccination. Both groups parenterally vaccinated any dogs that could be held for vaccination. The OBH method was more efficient on human resources, accessing 35 dogs per person per day, compared to 9 dogs per person per day through CVR. OBH accessed 80% of sighted dogs, compared to 63% by CVR teams, with OBH accessing a significantly higher proportion of inaccessible dogs in all land types. All staff reported that they believed OBH would be more successful in accessing dogs for vaccination. Fixed operational team cost of CVR was four times higher than OBH, at 127 USD per day, compared to 34 USD per day. Mean per dog vaccination cost of CVR was 2.53 USD, whilst OBH was 2.29 USD. Extrapolation to a two week India national campaign estimated that 1.1 million staff would be required using CVR, but 293,000 staff would be needed for OBH. OBH was operationally feasible, economical and effective at accessing the free roaming dog population. This study provides evidence for the continued expansion of research into the use of OBH as a supplementary activity to parenteral mass dog vaccination activities in India. © 2019},

abstract={A hybrid biological-biomaterial antigen delivery vector comprised of a polymeric shell encapsulating an Escherichia coli core was previously developed for in situ antigen production and subsequent delivery. Due to the engineering capacity of the bacterial core, the hybrid vector provides unique opportunities for immunogenicity optimization through varying cellular localization (cytoplasm, periplasm, cellular surface) and type (protein or DNA) of antigen. In this work, three protein-based hybrid vector formats were compared in which the pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) was localized to the cytoplasm, surface, and periplasmic space of the bacterial core for vaccination against pneumococcal disease. Furthermore, we tested the hybrid vector's capacity as a DNA vaccine against Streptococcus pneumoniae by introducing a plasmid into the bacterial core to facilitate PspA expression in antigen presenting cells (APCs). Through testing these various formulations, we determined that cytoplasmic accumulation of PspA elicited the strongest immune response (antibody production and protection against bacterial challenge) and enabled complete protection at substantially lower doses when compared to vaccination with PspA + adjuvant. We also improved the storage stability of the hybrid vector to retain complete activity after 1 month at 4 °C using an approach in which hybrid vectors suspended in a microbial freeze drying buffer were desiccated. These results demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of the hybrid vector formulation, which has the potential to be a potent vaccine against S. pneumoniae. © 2019 University at Buffalo, The State University of New York},

abstract={Background: We estimated influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in 2015–2016 season against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza, when quadrivalent inactivated vaccine (IIV4) was first introduced in Japan, using test-negative case-control design. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cocirculated with B/Yamagata and B/Victoria during the study period in Japan. Method: We based our case definition on two laboratory tests, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR), and virus isolation and compared VEs based on these tests. In addition, VE was evaluated by rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from outpatients who visited clinics with influenza-like illness (ILIs) in Hokkaido, Niigata, Gunma and Nagasaki prefectures. Results: Among 713 children and adults enrolled in this study, 578 were influenza positive by RT PCR including, 392 influenza A and 186 influenza B, while 135 were tested negative controls. The adjusted VE by RT PCR for all ages against any influenza was low protection of 36.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1% to 58.6%), for influenza A was 30.0% (95% CI: −10.0% to 55.5%), and influenza B was moderate 50.2% (95% CI: 13.3% to 71.4%). Adjusted VE for virus isolation for A(H1N1)pdm09 was 37.1% (95% CI: 1.7% to 59.7%), Yamagata lineage 51.3% (95% CI: 6.4% to 74.7%) and Victoria lineage 21.3% (95% CI: −50.0% to 58.9%). VE was highest and protective in 0–5 years old group against any influenza and influenza A and B/Yamagata, but the protective effect was not observed for other age groups and B/Victoria. RDT demonstrated concordant results with RT PCR and virus isolation. Sequencing of hemagglutinin gene showed that all A(H1N1)pdm09 belong to clade 6B including 31 strains (88.6%), which belong to clade 6B.1 possessing S162N mutations that may alter antigenicity and affect VE for A(H1N1)pdm09. Conclusions: IIV4 influenza vaccine during 2015–2016 was effective against A(H1N1)pdm09 and the two lineages of type B. Younger children was more protected than older children and adults by vaccination. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Background: Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia pseudomallei are the causative agents of glanders and melioidosis, respectively. There is no vaccine to protect against these highly-pathogenic and intrinsically antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and there is concern regarding their use as biological warfare agents. For these reasons, B. mallei and B. pseudomallei are classified as Tier 1 organisms by the U.S. Federal Select Agent Program and the availability of effective countermeasures represents a critical unmet need. Methods: Vaccines (subunit and vectored) containing the surface-exposed passenger domain of the conserved Burkholderia autotransporter protein BatA were administered to BALB/c mice and the vaccinated animals were challenged with lethal doses of wild-type B. mallei and B. pseudomallei strains via the aerosol route. Mice were monitored for signs of illness for a period of up to 40 days post-challenge and tissues from surviving animals were analyzed for bacterial burden at study end-points. Results: A single dose of recombinant Parainfluenza Virus 5 (PIV5) expressing BatA provided 74% and 60% survival in mice infected with B. mallei and B. pseudomallei, respectively. Vaccination with PIV5-BatA also resulted in complete bacterial clearance from the lungs and spleen of 78% and 44% of animals surviving lethal challenge with B. pseudomallei, respectively. In contrast, all control animals vaccinated with a PIV5 construct expressing an irrelevant antigen and infected with B. pseudomallei were colonized in those tissues. Conclusion: Our study indicates that the autotransporter BatA is a valuable target for developing countermeasures against B. mallei and B. pseudomallei and demonstrates the utility of the PIV5 viral vaccine delivery platform to elicit cross-protective immunity against the organisms. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The Brighton Collaboration Viral Vector Vaccines Safety Working Group (V3SWG) was formed to evaluate the safety and characteristics of live, recombinant viral vector vaccines. A recent publication by the V3SWG described live, attenuated, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) as a chimeric virus vaccine for HIV-1 (Clarke et al., 2016). The rVSV vector system is being explored as a platform for development of multiple vaccines. This paper reviews the molecular and biological features of the rVSV vector system, followed by a template with details on the safety and characteristics of a rVSV vaccine against Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV). The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is a live, replication competent vector in which the VSV glycoprotein (G) gene is replaced with the glycoprotein (GP) gene of ZEBOV. Multiple copies of GP are expressed and assembled into the viral envelope responsible for inducing protective immunity. The vaccine (designated V920) was originally constructed by the National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada, further developed by NewLink Genetics Corp. and Merck & Co., and is now in final stages of registration by Merck. The vaccine is attenuated by deletion of the principal virulence factor of VSV (the G protein), which also removes the primary target for anti-vector immunity. The V920 vaccine caused no toxicities after intramuscular (IM) or intracranial injection of nonhuman primates and no reproductive or developmental toxicity in a rat model. In multiple studies, cynomolgus macaques immunized IM with a wide range of virus doses rapidly developed ZEBOV-specific antibodies measured in IgG ELISA and neutralization assays and were fully protected against lethal challenge with ZEBOV virus. Over 20,000 people have received the vaccine in clinical trials; the vaccine has proven to be safe and well tolerated. During the first few days after vaccination, many vaccinees experience a mild acute-phase reaction with fever, headache, myalgia, and arthralgia of short duration; this period is associated with a low-level viremia, activation of anti-viral genes, and increased levels of chemokines and cytokines. Oligoarthritis and rash appearing in the second week occur at a low incidence, and are typically mild-moderate in severity and self-limited. V920 vaccine was used in a Phase III efficacy trial during the West African Ebola epidemic in 2015, showing 100% protection against Ebola Virus Disease, and it has subsequently been deployed for emergency control of Ebola outbreaks in central Africa.

abstract={Effect-directed analysis was used to identify previously unidentified aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists in sediments collected from a highly industrialized area of Ulsan Bay, Korea. The specific objectives were to (i) investigate potent fractions of sediment extracts using the H4IIE-luc bioassay, (ii) determine the concentrations of known AhR agonists (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and styrene oligomers (SOs)), (iii) identify previously unreported AhR agonists in fractions by use of GC-QTOFMS, and (iv) evaluate contributions of individual compounds to overall AhR-mediated potencies, found primarily in fractions containing aromatics with log Kow 5-8. Greater concentrations of PAHs and SOs were also found in those fractions. On the basis of GC-QTOFMS and GC-MSD analyses, 16 candidates for AhR agonists were identified in extracts of sediments. Of these, seven compounds, including 1-methylchrysene, benzo[j]fluoranthene, 3-methylchrysene, 5-methylbenz[a]anthracene, 11H-benzo[b]fluorene, benzo[b]naphtho[2,3-d]furan, and benzo[b]naphtho[2,1-d]thiophene, exhibited significant AhR activity. Relative potency values of newly identified AhR agonists were found to be greater than or comparable to that of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP). The potency balance analysis showed that newly identified AhR agonists explained 0.07-16% of bioassay-derived BaP-EQs. These chemicals were widely distributed in industrial sediments; thus, it is of immediate importance to conduct studies on sources and potential effects of those chemicals. © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={This operative video demonstrates the important considerations and details to perform a suction decompression technique to assist in clipping of a large middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm (Video 1). We present the case of a 58-year-old man with a 5-day history of dizziness. A computed tomography angiography revealed a 15-mm-diameter aneurysm in the left middle cerebral artery and a 6-mm-diameter aneurysm in the anterior communicating artery. Characterization of both lesions was obtained with a cerebral angiogram. Given the wide nature of the base of the MCA lesion, a surgical obliteration was considered best. A left frontotemporal craniotomy with the patient under total intravenous anesthesia and continuous neurophysiological monitoring was performed to approach both intracranial aneurysms. Access through the Sylvian fissure corridor was obtained, and the dome of the MCA lesion was quickly identified. The large aneurysm neck challenged visualization of the takeoff vessels of the MCA divisions, and after careful dissection, visualization remained poor; therefore, a suction decompression technique was considered appropriate to gain anatomical control. 1,2 For doing so, we used a 21-gauge needle wired to a 3-mm retractor on the Greenberg System, connected distally to suction. After cornering the lesion with temporary aneurysm clips, needle insertion was performed, enabling aneurysmal collapse and perfect visualization of the take-off vessels, which allowed proper clip deployment across the lesion. Next, we approached the anterior communicating artery aneurysm through the subfrontal region with successful clip deployment. Careful suction decompression could help the surgeon in obtaining better visualization. Patient approval and consent was obtained for submission of this video to this journal. © 2019},

abstract={Most studies of the uncertainties in climate change impact assessments focus on each stage independently without considering correlations between stages. Therefore, it is difficult to quantify the relative contribution of each stage to the total uncertainty and to identify how uncertainties are propagated as the stages proceed. In this study, we propose a new method for decomposing total uncertainty to components from individual stages. The proposed method is more theoretically sound compared to existing methods because the sum of the uncertainties from individual stages is always equal to the total uncertainty. In addition, the results of real data analysis indicate that our proposed method provides reasonable uncertainty decomposition. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Context: Recent developments in requirements engineering (RE) methods have seen a surge in using machine-learning (ML) algorithms to solve some difficult RE problems. One such problem is identification and classification of non-functional requirements (NFRs) in requirements documents. ML-based approaches to this problem have shown to produce promising results, better than those produced by traditional natural language processing (NLP) approaches. Yet, a systematic understanding of these ML approaches is still lacking. Method: This article reports on a systematic review of 24 ML-based approaches for identifying and classifying NFRs. Directed by three research questions, this article aims to understand what ML algorithms are used in these approaches, how these algorithms work and how they are evaluated. Results: (1) 16 different ML algorithms are found in these approaches; of which supervised learning algorithms are most popular. (2) All 24 approaches have followed a standard process in identifying and classifying NFRs. (3) Precision and recall are the most used matrices to measure the performance of these approaches. Finding: The review finds that while ML-based approaches have the potential in the classification and identification of NFRs, they face some open challenges that will affect their performance and practical application. Impact: The review calls for the close collaboration between RE and ML researchers, to address open challenges facing the development of real-world ML systems. Significance: The use of ML in RE opens up exciting opportunities to develop novel expert and intelligent systems to support RE tasks and processes. This implies that RE is being transformed into an application of modern expert systems. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={When using a ground water elevation dataset for the development of a ground water model, it is prudent to first evaluate the quality of the data before using it in a ground water model. However, it may not be practical to evaluate every data point when working with large datasets associated with a regional model. To isolate misrepresentative points in a large dataset, a graphical technique has been developed which examines the variance of ground water elevation values from an unconfined aquifer to identify points with high variance. The potential outliers identified using the graphical variogram process are subsequently evaluated by reviewing well borings, well installation records, and available time series of water level measurements to retain or reject outlier status. Supplemental ground elevation data from a digital elevation model is used to create a threshold on the experimental variogram of the ground water elevation data. This process is verified using a developed synthetic ground water dataset, then applied to a case study at the Fort Leonard Wood Military Reservation, Missouri. The method showed good results in identifying points that were justified for removal upon inspection of the available records and provides recommendations based on common causes of error. With this method's reliance on both, an experimental variogram of measured water levels and a binned variogram of ground elevation measures, it naturally fits as a preprocessing step that can be applied prior to kriging. © 2019},

abstract={Major restructuring including commercialisation of the water authorities in Australia during the past several decades has resulted in the loss of much valuable information on dam infrastructure costs. This paper sets out to provide an Australian perspective on dam costs and dam cost overruns, examine patterns of dam costs and cost overruns, and develop a good predictor of costs and cost overruns for the Australian situation. Several cost metrics, dam costs and related data, were collated for 98 dams constructed across Australia since 1888. Dam costs, operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, and construction overrun costs were related to independent variables including dam site terrain characteristics and catchment and climate attributes. Each metric was related through multiple regression to mainly physical and climate attributes associated with the dam. Multiple correlation coefficients account for between 50% and 80% of the variance in the dependent variable. The exceedance range (defined as 75% exceedance to 25% exceedance) of final dam costs (2016 AUD) (98 dams) is from $393 per ML of reservoir storage to $2040 per ML. Annual O&M costs (33 dams), expressed as a % of final dam cost, varies from 0.14% to 0.35%, though these O&M costs do not include major upgrades. The results of this study of Australian dams are in keeping with international studies that have found the estimated costs of large infrastructure projects are systematically biased downwards. In this study the median and mean cost overruns (40 dams), expressed as a percentage of the dam cost estimated immediately prior to construction, are 49% and 120% respectively with the smallest and largest cost overrun values being −48% and 825% respectively. Based on the available data dam cost overruns appear to be more prevalent in sedimentary rock than hard rock (e.g. igneous and metamorphic rocks) settings. The strong likelihood of dam cost overruns occurring has implications to forecasted benefit-cost ratios, and supports assertions that large dam cost and contingency estimates should be checked at pre-feasibility and feasibility stages by an independent organisation and by persons highly experienced in dam design, construction and costing. © 2019},

abstract={Background: Spinal cord astrocytomas are rare lesions in adults. Case Description: In this report, we present the case of a 28-year-old female patient who presented with a 2-year history of back pain and 3-month history of leg weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging of the patient showed an intrinsic expansive spinal cord lesion with extensive vertebral body destruction. Open biopsy from the tumor with limited debulking confirmed World Health Organization grade II astrocytoma. Postoperatively, the patient had mild improvement in neurologic status. Conclusions: This case represents a rare presentation of a spinal cord astrocytoma with extensive erosion of the vertebral body. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Trend analysis of air pollutant concentrations becomes problematic when applied to data from air quality monitoring networks containing time series of differing lengths. The average trend from such data can be misleading due to biases in the monitoring network. For example, if new monitoring sites located in more polluted locations are added to a network, the introduction of these time series can leverage the trend upwards. A method for resolving this problem was developed, using rolling window regression to recursively calculate the change in pollutant concentration as a function of time, which can be used as a proxy for the true trend. The efficacy of the method was established by conducting simulations with known trends. The rolling change trend was shown to more accurately reflect the true trend than simply averaging the time series. Application of the technique to estimate trends in NOx, NO2 and NO2/NOx concentrations at London roadside monitoring sites over the period 2000–2017 revealed clear differences from the simple average. In particular, a significant monotonic downward trend in NOx concentration was observed, in stark contrast to the average trend, which suggested little change in NOx concentration had occurred over the same period. By accurately representing trends using time series of different lengths, this method has the benefit of being able to describe changes in air quality for locations and time periods with otherwise insufficient data. © 2019},

Port Blair is strategically situated in the Bay of Bengal (BoB), which is known to be a significant moisture source to ISM rainfall over the Indian landmass. On the other hand, sites in the mainland are receivers of the BoB moisture. This dataset includes 1030 isotopic analyses made on daily water samples as well as rainfall amount (24 hours) during ISM.

abstract={Sorbitol can be produced photosynthetically in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 harboring sorbitol-6-phosphate (S6P) dehydrogenase (S6PDH) from apple, representing a promising metabolic engineering strategy for environmentally friendly carbon-based compound production. However, no gene for S6P phosphatase has been reported to date. We previously found that members of the Escherichia coli haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase (HAD) superfamily, a group of promiscuous hydrolases, exert phosphatase activity to S6P in vitro. Here, we examined the effects of HADs on sorbitol production in cyanobacterial cells. Overexpression of E. coli HAD1 improved sorbitol production induced by toxic S6PDH, whereas it suppressed growth even without induction. Moreover, overexpression of HAD1 in combination with engineering of other pathways successfully allowed for the constitutive expression of toxic S6PDH. Consequently, the sorbitol production was highly improved, which in turn suppressed the growth suppression effect of promiscuous HAD1. These results provide a good example of a novel metabolic engineering strategy using a combination of a promiscuous enzyme with an abundant supply of one of its substrates. © 2019},

The calculated frequencies of NH3 based on the new coordinates agreed well with the experimental values, even at the VSCF level, including overtone and combination bands as well as tunnel doubling.

Periodic DFT calculations (CASTEP) of a model 4FB crystal proved useful for vibrational assignment, yielding estimates of experimental spectra with near one-to-one correspondence – including the correct estimation of overtone and combination modes. A striking similarity among the Far-IR spectrum of liquid 4FB and that estimated based on a periodic structure indicates that the solid-liquid transition induces soft structural changes which leave most vibrational modes unaffected – except for those directly involved in C–H…O bonding, where crystal field splitting is observed. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={The impact of drying and temperature on the reduction of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in stormwater bioretention systems with and without a submerged zone was assessed using 16 pilot-scale bioretention columns under controlled laboratory conditions. The experimental design enabled analysis of possible interactions between the factors. First outflow and event-based samples were collected. Outflow concentrations were independent of inflow concentrations and hence controlled by internal processes. Overall TSS removal was high but sensitive to bacterial synthesis. Event-based samples had significantly higher bacteria concentrations than first outflow samples, suggesting that remaining/surviving bacteria in the bioretention cells have little effect on initial peak outflow concentrations. The effect of temperature varied between bacterial species and sample types. Long dry periods seemed beneficial for bacteria reduction, but outflow bacteria concentrations peaked during the second watering after long dry periods. Submerged zones significantly reduced bacteria outflow concentrations. However, sudden temperature increases caused bioretention cells with a submerged zone to produce significantly higher bacteria outflow concentrations than before the temperature increase, which was not the case for standard cells. Bioretention cells with submerged zones may thus be poor choices for reducing bacterial concentrations in stormwater runoff in areas experiencing winter conditions.

abstract={Detonation nanodiamonds hard-hydrogels are aggregates of polyhedral particles of sp3-hybridized-carbon coated by atomically thin sp2-hybridized carbon. Electronic properties of diamond are sensitive to water in the surrounding environment. The effect of adsorbed water on the electrical conductivity of detonation nanodiamonds was studied by exposure to humid air after thermal treatment in vacuo. The electrical conductivity increases with heating and decreases during the isothermal treatment at 393 K due to release of strongly adsorbed water, and gradually increases on exposing to humid air, indicating adsorption of water molecules on micropores and mesopores in the nanodiamond aggregates. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Background: Petroclival tumors are formidable challenges for skull base surgeons. Obtaining adequate surgical access is a paramount consideration. Although the combined transpetrosal approach provides a wide surgical corridor, it is technically challenging and, to a degree, morbid. This article describes the transpetrosal-ridge approach, which is a modification of the combined transpetrosal approach with improvements with regards to ease of execution and reduced surgical morbidity. Methods: The key elements of the transpetrosal-ridge approach are outlined, followed by a detailed description of the steps. The head is placed in the lateral position. After skin incision and muscle elevation, a temporo-suboccipital craniotomy is performed. Middle fossa dura is elevated to the petrous ridge. A limited mastoidectomy is performed with preservation of the semicircular canals. The remaining petrous ridge is then resected and the posterior fossa dura is opened, with the opening extending through the trigeminal dural ring. Results: Steps of the combined transpetrosal approach that do not contribute to the final surgical corridor are omitted. Extensive mastoid and petrous apex resection is avoided. Posterior fossa dural opening extending through the trigeminal dural ring is a critical step, as it detaches the superior petrosal sinus and sigmoid sinus from the petrous bone. With the retraction of the temporal lobe and the cerebellum and sigmoid sinus, a wide surgical corridor is obtained. Conclusions: The transpetrosal-ridge approach is a modification of the combined transpetrosal approach with optimization of the operative steps while continuing to provide a wide surgical corridor to the petroclival region. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Background: An aplastic or twig-like middle cerebral artery (Ap/T-MCA) is a rare congenital anomaly that can present with both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. The etiology of this pathology has remained unclear. Here, we report 2 cases of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) owing to an Ap/T-MCA in pregnant patients. Case Description: In both patients, cerebral angiography revealed a steno-occlusive lesion and an abnormal arterial network on the unilateral middle cerebral artery. One patient was treated conservatively for a putaminal hemorrhage, and a cesarean section was performed uneventfully 6 months after onset of the ICH. The other patient underwent a craniotomy for evacuation of the lobar hemorrhage. Subsequently, a cesarean section was performed uneventfully. Both patients gradually recovered without significant disabilities. Conclusions: An Ap/T-MCA is a rare congenital anomaly and is a potential cause of ICH for pregnant patients. A cesarean section is a useful option for pregnant patients with this condition. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Background: Glioblastoma multiforme with a primitive neuronal component is a rare entity, with few cases reported in the literature. Case Description: A patient who had a supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme with a primitive neuronal component developed spinal metastasis during the disease course. With his history of leukemia during childhood, he was likely exposed to therapeutic ionizing brain radiation, which could have increased the risk of developing brain cancer in adulthood. Conclusions: The range of incidence rates of dissemination in the literature is 2%–4%, typically in cases of cerebellar glioblastoma multiforme, but as high as 25% in autopsy series. Our case highlights several other topics in the literature, such as immunohistochemical patterns that differ between the primary tumor and spinal metastases and dissemination locations, typically leptomeningeal or ventricular invasion. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Objective: There are several material options for duraplasty in surgery for foramen magnum decompression (FMD). We retrospectively analyzed surgical results and the impact of sequential alteration of posterior fossa (PF) size in patients with Chiari malformation type 1 after duraplasty using local fascia. Methods: The patients with Chiari malformation type 1 who underwent FMD with duraplasty using local fascia at our institution between 2004 and 2015 were included in the study. Some pediatric patients who underwent FMD without duraplasty and patients with insufficient follow-up data were excluded. Improvement of clinical signs, regression of syrinx, and temporal alteration of PF size were analyzed with perioperative magnetic resonance imaging. Postoperative clinical outcomes were evaluated at the final follow-up using the Chicago Chiari Outcome Scale. Correlations between the PF size alteration and size of dural patch or Chicago Chiari Outcome Scale were statistically analyzed. Results: Twelve patients were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 31.9 (range, 18–48) years. Syrinx was incorporated in 11 patients and regressed postoperatively in all patients. The PF was significantly enlarged sequentially over time (P < 0.05). The degree of enlargement was positively correlated with size of the fascial patch (r = 0.540). Postoperative clinical outcomes at final follow-up were positively correlated with the degree of PF enlargement (r = 0.678). Conclusions: The PF was enlarged sequentially over time after duraplasty using local fascia. The degree of enlargement was positively correlated with the size of the fascial patch and the likelihood of a favorable postoperative outcome. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={We investigated photocatalytic water-oxidation performance of tetrahedron-shaped silver phosphate (Ag3PO4) crystals with various particle sizes. The performance was clearly influenced by the particle size. The maximum activity was found for the particle with a tetrahedron edge with 1.5 μm length, which showed the highest rate of oxygen evolution. A series of analysis against time-resolved diffuse reflection spectra of the powder samples reveals that not only carrier recombination dynamic but also photoexcited carrier density can play important roles in the water oxidation. Our finding should contribute to give one of the basic ideas when designing semiconductor photocatalysts for water splitting. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={This study evaluates the hypothesis that increased organic-contaminant sorption and hence residence time in urban riverbed deposits may occur due to the presence of highly sorbing sediment components of anthropogenic origin that contain thermally altered carbonaceous materials (TACM). The hypothesis was confirmed through laboratory-batch studies examining tetrachloroethene (PCE) sorption on riverbed sediment samples from the highly urbanised River Tame headwaters catchment (Birmingham, UK) and the River Tern (Shropshire) providing a nearby rural benchmark. Urban-riverbed sorption was elevated with observed organic-carbon partition coefficient (Koc) values over an order of magnitude greater than rural values. The latter compare to the widely used US EPA geometric-mean Koc and attributed to absorption-dominated partitioning into (recent) natural organic matter. Use of that mean is inappropriate for the urban riverbed, potentially underestimating retardation by an order of magnitude. Organic petrography confirmed the urban riverbed contained a high proportion of TACM-rich organic-matter particles to which significant adsorption might be expected; furthermore, elevated urban Koc values were consistent with TACM-rich sediment literature estimates. The TACM source appears to be riverine transport of particulate matter from historical industrial/urban or coal-mining/processing activities prevalent upstream since the Industrial Revolution. Consequences of the increased urban riverbed residence time on attenuation and bioavailability assumption sensitivities were modelled. Under the standard assumption of sorbed contaminant being non-bioavailable, rapid rates of aqueous-phase biodegradation are necessary for complete attenuation within a riverbed. Conversely, if adsorbed contaminant is bioavailable, then complete attenuation is probable where highly adsorbing (Anthropocene urban) riverbed sediments are present, even for long half-lives. Therefore, Anthropocene-sediment occurrence may significantly influence modern-day contaminant fate within the urban riverbed; the principal implication being greatly increased sorption and residence times may occur in urban riverbeds than conventionally assumed. Further research should focus upon whether adsorbed contaminants have any bioavailability causing increased contaminant flux attenuation and surface-water quality protection. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Gaseous emissions from vehicles contribute substantially to air pollution and climate change. Vehicular emissions also contain secondary pollutants produced via chemical reactions that occur between the emitted gases and atmospheric air. This study aims at understanding patterns concerning emission of regulated, greenhouse, and precursor gases, which demonstrate potential for secondary aerosol (SA) formation, from vehicles incorporating different engine technologies-multi-point injection (MPI) and gasoline direct injection (GDI)-and using different fuels-gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and diesel. Drive cycles from the National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER) were used in this study. Results obtained from drive cycle tests demonstrate a decline in aggregate gas emissions corresponding to an increase in average vehicle speed. CO2 accounts for more than 99% of aggregate gaseous emissions. In terms of concentration, CO and NH3 form predominantly non-CO2 emissions from gasoline and LPG vehicles, whereas nitrogen oxides (NOx) and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) dominate diesel-vehicle emissions. A higher percentage of SO2 is emitted from diesel vehicles compared to their gasoline- and LPG-powered counterparts. EURO-5- and EURO-6-compliant vehicles equipped with diesel particulate filters (DPFs) tend to emit higher amounts of NO2 compared to EURO-3-compliant vehicles, which are not equipped with DPFs. Vehicles incorporating GDI tend to emit less CO2 compared to those incorporating MPI, albeit at the expense of increased CO emissions. The authors believe that results reported in this paper concerning regulated and unregulated pollutant-emission monitoring can contribute towards an accurate evaluation of both primary and secondary air-pollution scenarios in Korea. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={An approach is proposed to obtain approximate geometries for minimum energy conical intersections between the ground and first excited singlet electronic states (S0/S1-MECIs) using the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). This approach uses the energy shift method to avoid discontinuities on TDDFT potential energy surfaces around conical intersections. It is shown numerically that the approximate S0/S1-MECIs of benzene and naphthalene obtained by this approach qualitatively reproduce the geometries and energies of the S0/S1-MECIs obtained by multireference theories. Moreover, the performance of the present approach when combined with an automated MECI searching method is examined through applications to benzene and naphthalene. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Background: The success of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) depends on multiple preoperative and intraoperative factors. The multifactorial influence adds an element of unpredictability to the outcome of the most well-planned procedure. Clinical symptoms and signs may not reflect the status of the ETV stoma postprocedure and the morbidity associated with ETV failure could be catastrophic. In this study, the authors look at the role of early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict failure to avoid morbidity secondary to malfunction and propose a modified success criterion to guide treatment plan post-ETV failure. Our aim is to prospectively and retrospectively study the use of early postoperative MRI in predicting potential early ETV failure. Methods: Patients who underwent ETV at Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences from March 2011 to August 2017. The study was a retrospective and prospective observational blinded study. Inclusion criteria included patients with any form of obstructive hydrocephalus who underwent ETV and had undergone an early postoperative MRI in the first 48 hours—or latest by discharge—with a follow-up of at least 3 months. The patient details and the presence of the flow void in the immediate postoperative MRI were documented. Follow-up was for at least 3 months to identify early failures. Results: A total of 67 ETVs were performed in 65 patients. At 3 months follow-up, of the 59 ETVs with flow void on MRI, 53 were successful, whereas 6 failed. Of the 8 without flow void, 4 were successful. The overall sensitivity was 93.0, whereas specificity was 40.0. With increasing age, the negative predictive value improved from 25% in age <1 year to 100% in age >5 years, with an accuracy reaching 96% to predict failure of ETV. Conclusions: An early postoperative MRI is very sensitive to failure of ETV, but not highly specific. The negative predictive value and accuracy of MRI improve significantly with increasing age and in non-hemorrhagic non-infective obstructive etiology. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Background: Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor (World Health Organization grade I) is considered as a benign tumor with very low potential for progression. The potential for malignant transformation of this tumor is not known and has never been reported before in literature. Case Description: We report a 42-year-old man, diagnosed with rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor of the fourth ventricle with a positive isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation, progressed to glioblastoma after 6 years from diagnosis. We discuss the clinical history, radiological findings, and histopathological characteristic with immunohistochemistry findings observed in this unique case. Conclusions: Despite being acceptable as benign, based on our observations in this case, there is a potential for malignant transformation of rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor. The role of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation leading to malignant transformation could not be established as our finding is novel and further prospective studies are required to prove this association. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Peptidic toxins that target specifically mammalian channels and receptors can be found in the venom of animals. These toxins are rarely used directly as tools for biochemical experiments, and need to be modified via the attachment of chemical groups (e.g., radioactive or fluorescent moieties). Ideally, such modifications should maintain the toxin specificity and affinity for its target. With the goal of obtaining fluorescent derivatives of BeKm-1, a toxin from the scorpion species Buthus eupeus that selectively inhibits the voltage-gated potassium ion channel hERG, we produced four active analogues using a model of BeKm-1 docking to the outer mouth of the channel. In these BeKm-1 analogues, the natural peptide was linked to the fluorescent cyanine 5 (Cy5) probe via four different linkers at Arg 1 or Arg/Lys 27 . All analogues retained their specificity towards the hERG channel in electrophysiological experiments but displayed a lesser affinity. These results validate our strategy for designing toxin analogues and demonstrate that different chemical groups can be attached to different residues of BeKm-1. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The United States Environmental Protection Agency held an international two-day workshop in June 2018 to deliberate possible performance targets for non-regulatory fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) air sensors. The need for a workshop arose from the lack of any market-wide manufacturer requirement for documented sensor performance evaluations, the lack of any independent third party or government-based sensor performance certification program, and uncertainty among all users as to the general usability of air sensor data. A multi-sector subject matter expert panel was assembled to facilitate an open discussion on these issues with multiple stakeholders. This summary provides an overview of the workshop purpose, key findings from the deliberations, and considerations for future actions specific to sensors. Important findings concerning PM2.5 and O3 sensors included the lack of consistent performance indicators and statistical metrics as well as highly variable data quality requirements depending on the intended use. While the workshop did not attempt to yield consensus on any topic, a key message was that a number of possible future actions would be beneficial to all stakeholders regarding sensor technologies. These included documentation of best practices, sharing quality assurance results along with sensor data, and the development of a common performance target lexicon, performance targets, and test protocols. © 2019},

abstract={Air pollution in large urban areas has become a serious issue due to its negative impacts on human health, building materials, biodiversity and urban ecosystems in both developed and less-wealthy nations. In most large urban areas, especially in developed countries air quality monitoring networks (AQMN) have been established that provide air quality (AQ) data for various purposes, e.g., to monitor regulatory compliance and to assess the effectiveness of control strategies. However, the criteria of structuring the network are currently defined by single questions rather than attempting to create a network to serve multiple functions. Here we propose a methodology supported by numerical, conceptual and GIS frameworks for structuring AQMN using social, environmental and economic indicators as a case study in Sheffield, UK. The main factors used for air quality monitoring station (AQMS) selection are population-weighted pollution concentration (PWPC) and weighted spatial variability (WSV) incorporating population density (social indicator), pollution levels and spatial variability of air pollutant concentrations (environmental indicator). Total number of sensors is decided on the basis of budget (economic indicator), whereas the number of sensors deployed in each output area is proportional to WSV. The purpose of AQ monitoring and its role in determining the location of AQMS is analysed. Furthermore, the existing AQMN is analysed and an alternative proposed following a formal procedure. In contrast to traditional networks, which are structured based on a single AQ monitoring approach, the proposed AQMN has several layers of sensors: Reference sensors recommended by EU and DEFRA, low-cost sensors (LCS) (AQMesh and Envirowatch E-MOTEs) and IoT (Internet of Things) sensors. The core aim is to structure an integrated AQMN in urban areas, which will lead to the collection of AQ data with high spatiotemporal resolution. The use of LCS in the proposed network provides a cheaper option for setting up a purpose-designed network for greater spatial coverage, especially in low- and middle-income countries. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Temperature-dependent optical absorption spectra have been recorded for Cr3+ doped silicate glasses between 10 K and 773 K. Due to the intermediate ligand field strength of the Cr3+ coordination environment, overlap of the lowest-energy spin-allowed 4A2 → 4T2 band and the two spin-forbidden transitions to the 2E and 2T1 states at approximately 650 nm results in interference dips. An analytical model equation is fitted to the spectra and electronic structure parameters extracted. This represents the first time that variations of these parameters with temperature are obtained over a large temperature range, revealing characteristics of all three overlapping d-d transitions. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={Air pollution measured as particulate matter (PM) has been shown to be detrimental to human health and can lead to increased mortality rates. There are four main indoor sources of episodic PM emissions: smoking, cooking, cleaning and resuspension. This study has eliminated all human activity and provides data on the variability of the contribution from external sources via mechanical ventilation. The transportation of PM from an external to internal environment by mechanical ventilation is investigated in the same room in two, similar timber-framed houses, constructed identically apart from details affecting their airtightness. There was significant variation in the transportation of PM from an external to internal environment in two similar houses ([PM] Control &gt; [PM] Test (ρ = 0.001)) despite both houses operating the same mechanical ventilation system. Mean internal PM10 concentrations = 2.4 μg m−3 (Control) and 1.3 μg m−3 (Test) with corresponding mean external PM10 concentrations of 5.4 μg m−3 and 5.2 μg m−3 respectively. Particle removal efficiency between the two houses varied by approximately 20%. These findings indicate that there is considerable variation in filtration efficiencies even when the same mechanical ventilation system is in use in similar homes in the same location. The infiltration factor (Finf) was calculated and demonstrated considerable variability both between houses (Control-Test PM10 0.40–0.23) and over time (Control PM10 0.40–0.18) which indicates that relationship between external and internal concentrations of PM is not linear and should therefore be used with caution. This questions simplifying Finf into one factor as there are likely to be multiple contributing factors. For example, the effect of air flow on particle adsorption to internal surfaces, natural variations in filter efficiency and variations in particle loss. Over the duration of this study, PM concentrations decreased in both bedrooms by 52% (Control) and 37% (Test), which may be due to a number of factors including changes in internal environmental conditions, filter age and the cumulative effect of the use of mechanical ventilation over time reducing the transportation of PM into the houses. © 2019 The Author(s)},

Numerous BVOCs were observed in the headspace samples, including n-alkanes (e.g., n-dodecane, n-tridecane, n-tetradecane and n-pentadecane) and oxygenated hydrocarbons (e.g., octanal, nonanal, geranyl acetone, and 6-methyl-hepten-2-one), though the majority of VOCs emitted was not identified. The emissions from Ulva spp., Callophyllis spp. and F. gardneri samples contained a similar assortment of n-alkanes and oxygenated BVOCs (e.g., n-aldehydes) as observed at Mace Head, Ireland, whereas the headspaces above N. luetkeana and A. marginata contained monoterpenes, foremost limonene, and toluene. Further studies are needed to constrain emissions of BVOCs from near-coastal vegetation as they have the potential to substantially impact coastal O3 budgets and the organic content of marine derived aerosol. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Several snake species possess, in their circulating blood, endogenous PLA 2 inhibitors (sbPLIs) with the primary function of natural protection against toxic enzymes from homologous and heterologous venoms. Among the three structural classes of sbPLIs – named α, β, and γ − the β class (sbβPLIs) is the least known with only four identified sequences, so far. The last class of inhibitors encompass molecules with leucine rich repeats (LRRs) motifs containing repeating amino acid segments. In the present study, we identified and characterized putative sbβPLIs from the liver and venom glands of six Latin American pit vipers belonging to Bothrops and Crotalus genera. The inhibitor from Crotalus durissus terrificus snakes (CdtsbβPLI) was chosen as a reference for the construction of the first in silico structural model for this class of inhibitors, using molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations. Detailed analyses of the electrostatic surface of the CdtsbβPLI model and protein-protein docking with crotoxin B from homologous venoms predict the interacting surface between these proteins. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={In this paper, a novel multi-module neural network system named MMNNS is proposed to solve the imbalance problem in electrocardiogram (ECG) heartbeats classification. Four submodules are designed to construct the system: preprocessing, imbalance problem processing, feature extraction and classification. Imbalance problem processing module mainly introduces three methods: BLSM, CTFM and 2PT, which are proposed from three aspects of resampling, data feature and algorithm respectively. BLSM is used to synthesize virtual samples linearly around the minority samples. CTFM consists of DAE-based feature extraction part and QRS-based feature selection part, in which selected features and complete features are applied to determine the heartbeat class simultaneously. The processed data are fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN) by applying 2PT to train and fine-tune. MMNNS is trained on MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database following AAMI standard, using intra-patient and inter-patient scheme, especially the latter which is strongly recommended. The comparisons with several state-of-the-art methods using standard criteria on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of MMNNS for improving detection of heartbeats and addressing imbalance in ECG heartbeats classification. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Background: Brain tumor surgery requires careful balance between maximizing tumor excision and preserving eloquent cortex. In some cases, the surgeon may opt to perform an awake craniotomy including intraoperative mapping of brain function by direct cortical stimulation (DCS) to assist in surgical decision-making. Preoperatively, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) facilitates planning by identification of eloquent brain areas, helping to guide DCS and other aspects of the surgical plan. However, brain deformation (shift) limits the usefulness of preoperative fMRI during surgery. To address this, an integrated visualization method for fMRI and DCS results is developed that is intuitive for the surgeon. Methods: An image registration pipeline was constructed to display preoperative fMRI data corrected for brain shift overlaid on images of the exposed cortical surface at the beginning and completion of DCS mapping. Preoperative fMRI and DCS data were registered for a range of misalignments, and the residual registration errors were calculated. The pipeline was validated on imaging data from five brain tumor patients who underwent awake craniotomy. Results: Registration errors were well under 5 mm (the approximate spatial resolution of DCS) for misalignments of up to 25 mm and approximately 10–15°. For rotational misalignments up to 20° the success rate was 95% for an error tolerance of 5 mm. Failures were negligible for rotational misalignments up to 10°. Good quality registrations were observed for all five patients. Conclusions: A proof-of-concept image registration pipeline is presented with acceptable accuracy for intraoperative use, providing multimodality visualization with potential benefits for intraoperative brain mapping. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Many occupant activities can adversely affect indoor air quality which has been shown to be detrimental to human health. This research eliminated some of the variability of previous measured levels of indoor particulate matter (PM) by removing all human activity and providing baseline data on the contribution occurring from home furnishings. Further objectives included investigating the effects of airtightness and mechanical ventilation on internal PM concentrations with controlled simulated occupancy. With natural ventilation, PM concentrations were 15% greater in bedroom of the less airtight (Control) house than that of the (Test house), post-furnishing which indicates that there is a considerable amount of natural variation which may not be solely due to occupant activities. Simulated occupancy dramatically increased the concentration of PM found in both houses by just under 5-fold. With simulated occupancy, the majority of the PM was present as fine particles (≤PM1) for both houses (93–94%), whereas without simulated occupancy, the proportion of fine particles was lower (88–89%). After furnishing and without the use of mechanical ventilation, PM10 concentrations exceeded the WHO Guidelines for PM10 of 50 μg m−3 for 56% of the testing duration for the Control bedroom and 35% for the Test bedroom. The use of mechanical ventilation reduced the mean internal PM concentrations by approximately 90% for all PM sizes in both study bedrooms which highlights the importance of use and maintenance of effective ventilation systems especially after furnishing activities. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Air quality model results are used in a relative sense as part of the process to demonstrate attainment of the U.S. ozone standard. Ozone model predictions for a future year are divided by corresponding model results for a base year to obtain a Relative Reduction Factor (RRF), and the base-year measured ozone design value (DV) is multiplied by the RRF to estimate the future-year design value (DVF). We developed alternative RRFs and DVFs that focus on the increment of local ozone production above regional background (RB). An advantage of the alternative DVFs is that measurements can be used to determine RB ozone, thereby increasing the use of measurements in the DVF estimates. We simulated ozone formation in the Houston area for May–September 2012 and 2028 using the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions and compared the standard and alternative RRFs and DVFs. If model results are used for all the RB ozone concentrations in our new equation to calculate DVFs, the alternative and standard DVFs are very similar for Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB). If measurements are used for the RB ozone concentrations we combine with the base-year DVs, the alternative DVFs are noticeably larger than the standard DVFs for about half the sites, with the increase being 7 ppb at the site (Deer Park) with the largest standard and alternative DVFs. The differences arise primarily from including different days in the averaging process for the RRFs versus the base-year DVs. We evaluated model performance for the days included in the RRFs and found that the model over-predicted RB ozone (normalized mean bias (NMB) = 26%) and under-predicted the anthropogenic ozone increment (NMB = -22%) from HGB emissions and therefore can be expected to under-estimate ozone response to HGB emission controls. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Crops and crop residues contribute to pollution of the environment by ammonia (NH3) volatilization. This study focusses on the volatilization from crop residues, defined as residues after a management action or frost i.e. residues that are left on the field after harvest, after killing by use of herbicides or after frost. The objective of this study was to develop a general methodology to calculate the volatilization from crop residues and to estimate their contribution to the NH3 volatilization at a national scale. A regression model was developed to assess the NH3 volatilization from crop residue based on the nitrogen (N) content of the residue (emission factor). Information on farm practices (degree of incorporation of residues, the application of crop killing and mowing frequency of grass), harvested crop areas, and N load in crop was used to calculate the emission from crop residues at national scale. The contribution of crop residues to the national NH3 volatilization in the Netherlands was substantial and calculated at 1.9 million kg NH3-N. Grassland contributed about three quarters of total NH3 volatilization from crop residues. Most volatilization occurs from the mowing losses (54%) and renovation of grassland (14%). Residues of arable crops also have a contribution of 14% to total volatilization. Within arable crops, potatoes are responsible for more than half of the NH3 volatilization, with the largest contribution from seed potatoes, followed by sugar beet and cabbage crops. NH3 volatilization from green manure crop residues (killed by freezing or spraying herbicides) is about half the volatilization from arable crop residues (7%). The developed general approach for estimating the NH3 volatilization from crop residues was applied for the Netherlands but may also be applicable to other countries, taking into account their site specific emission factors and farm practices statistics. © 2019},

abstract={The influence of metal removal with a chelating reagent, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and metal reconstitution on the activity of particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b toward methane oxidation to methanol was investigated. For this study, a membrane fraction containing pMMO and bacterial cell membrane components was prepared. pMMO activity was assessed with two different reductants, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl hydroquinone (duroquinol). The partial removal of metal ions with EDTA resulted in the selective inhibition of NADH-driven activity. The NADH-driven activity was restored by exogenous copper ions, but not by other divalent metal cations. Furthermore, both NADH- and duroquinol-driven activities were lost completely by increasing the amount of metal removed. Duroquinol-driven activity of the metal-deficient membrane fraction increased with increasing the amount of copper ions added, while NADH-driven activity increased when more than 5 mol of copper ions per mol of pMMO monomer was added. These results suggest that NADH-driven pMMO activity requires not only the catalytic copper center of pMMO but also copper ions outside the catalytic site. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={The Genus Alexandrium is a widespread dinoflagellate marine phytoplankton that is the primary causative organism causing Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) intoxications in European waters. EU food safety directives specify that EU Member States must implement a routine monitoring programme to mitigate risks associated with bio-accumulation of biotoxins by bivalve shellfish, such as those produced by Alexandrium. This strategic drive comprises of both direct testing of bivalve flesh for the presence of regulated toxins and an early warning phytoplankton monitoring programme. In the UK the flesh testing moved away from animal bio-assays to analytical chemistry techniques, whereas phytoplankton monitoring methods have seen little technological advancement since implementation. Methods currently utilize light microscopy and manual enumeration of different algal species. These methods although proven are time consuming, reliant on highly trained staff, have high limits of detection (LOD) with low specificity, unable to reliably identify Alexandrium to species level. The implications of these limitations of the techniques mean that in the case of Alexandrium the LOD is also the action limit and as such it is easy to miss positive samples affecting the efficacy of any early warning strategy. This study outlines the development, preliminary method characterisation, validation and trial implementation of an alternative early warning technique, utilizing quantitative PCR to identify water samples containing Alexandrium cells. The approach outlined in this document, showed an improved correlation with flesh toxicity, improved sensitivity, improved throughput compared to traditional light microscopy methods and there was also good correlation with higher cell abundance samples when compared to the light microscopy results. The application of this approach to routine water samples was explored and was found to demonstrate potential as a corroborative method for use during flesh intoxication episodes. This study offers potential for future improvements in the accuracy and sensitivity of phytoplankton monitoring whilst ensuring continuity of public safety, providing cost savings and offering new research opportunities. © 2019},

abstract={Background: Ventral brainstem compression secondary to complex craniovertebral junction abnormality is an infrequent cause of neurologic deterioration in pediatric patients. However, in cases of symptomatic, irreducible ventral compression, 360° decompression of the brainstem supported by posterior stabilization may provide the best opportunity for improvement in symptoms. More recently, the endoscopic endonasal corridor has been proposed as an alternative method of odontoidectomy associated with less morbidity. We report the largest single case series of pediatric patients using this dual-intervention surgical technique. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the surgical outcomes of pediatric patients who underwent posterior occipitocervical decompression and instrumentation followed by endoscopic endonasal odontoidectomy performed to relieve neurologic impingement involving the ventral brainstem and craniocervical junction. Methods: Between January 2011 and February 2017, 7 patients underwent posterior instrumented fusion followed by endonasal endoscopic odontoidectomy at our unit. Standardized clinical and radiological parameters were assessed before and after surgery. A univariate analysis was performed to assess clinical and radiologic improvement after surgery. Results: A total of 14 operations were performed on 7 pediatric patients. One patient had Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, 1 patient had a Chiari 1 malformation, and the remaining 5 patients had Chiari 1.5 malformations. Average extubation day was postoperative day 0.9. Average day of initiation of postoperative feeds was postoperative day 1.0. Conclusions: The combined endoscopic endonasal odontoidectomy and posterior decompression and fusion for complex craniovertebral compression is a safe and effective procedure that appears to be well tolerated in the pediatric population. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Objective: Intracranial aneurysms are considered large if >10 mm and giant if >25 mm. The risk of aneurysmal rupture compounds with increase in size of the aneurysm, thus, warranting appropriate intervention. In this study, we have analyzed the outcome and effectiveness of microsurgical procedures in large and giant aneurysms. Methods: A retrospective analysis of all the patients who underwent microsurgical procedures for large and giant cerebral aneurysms from 2014–2018 in our institute was conducted. There were a total of 52 patients, in which direct clipping was performed in 42 (80.7%) patients, proximal trapping in 3 (5.7%) patients, trapping with bypass in 3 (5.7%) patients, suction decompression in 3 (5.7%) patients, and 1 (1.9%) patient underwent surgical reconstruction. Results: Among the 52 patients, in the postoperative period, 1 (1.9%) patient became comatose, 1 (1.9%) patient developed hemiplegia, 1 (1.9%) patient had a transient hemiparesis, and 1 (1.9%) patient had transient lower cranial nerve palsy. Two (3.8%) patients had chronic subdural hematoma during the 3-month follow-up. There was no mortality in our series. Conclusions: There are several treatment strategies available to manage large and giant cerebral aneurysms. In this study, we had minimal morbidity (3.8%), favorable outcome (96.1%), and no mortality. Therefore, we would like to conclude that appropriate microsurgical procedures, in experienced hands, can be considered as first line in the management for large and giant intracranial aneurysms, especially those with complex anatomy, wide neck, mass effect, partial thrombosis, and the presence of critical perforating vessels from the aneurysm wall. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Groundwater seepage influences the temperature of streams and rivers by providing a relatively cool input in summer and warm input in winter. Because of this, groundwater seepage can be a determining factor in the provision of suitable water temperatures for aquatic biota. Climate warming affects stream and groundwater temperatures, and changes the thermal characteristics of streams leading to the potential disappearance of habitats. In this study the importance of groundwater for the temperature of two Dutch lowland streams and its possible role in mitigating the effects of climate change was determined by combining field measurements and a modelling experiment. Stream temperature measurements using fibre optic cables (FO-DTS) and sampling of 222Rn were done to map localized groundwater inflow. Several springs and seepage ‘hot-spots’ were located which buffered the water temperature in summer and winter. A stream temperature model was constructed and calibrated using the FO-DTS-measurements to quantify the energy fluxes acting on stream water. This way, the contribution to the stream thermal budget of direct solar radiation, air temperature and seepage were separated. The model was then used to simulate the effects of changes in shading, groundwater seepage and climate. Shading was shown to be an important control on summer temperature maxima. Groundwater seepage seemed to buffer the effect of climate warming, potentially making groundwater dominated streams more climate robust. Protecting groundwater resources in a changing climate is important for the survival of aquatic species in groundwater-fed systems, as groundwater seepage both sustains flow and buffers temperature extremes. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) is a major atmospheric pollutant which is produced from a variety of anthropogenic sources, notably vehicular emissions. High NO2 concentrations are found in and around the urban environment and as such pose a significant threat to human health. Diffusion tube surveys of NO2 concentrations were carried out at a variety of intersections and road layouts over a 3-month period in 2017. This study identified that ‘hotspots’ in NO2 concentrations frequently occurred in sections of road where vehicles are accelerating or queueing. Under these conditions, concentrations were elevated by 58.6% and 52.6% respectively compared to when vehicles were cruising. Analysis of environmental factors which influence NO2 concentrations show that meteorology, topography, traffic volume and driver behaviour all contribute. The results highlight the complexity of monitoring hotspot locations and show the need for traffic and driver behaviour to be included in vehicle emission models. Additionally, the investigation suggests need for caution when relying on in-situ monitors to determine pollutant exceedances as there is shown to be substantial variation along a street and the location of the monitor is critical. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={The metropolitan area of Tokyo, the capital of Japan, emits a large amount of carbon dioxide (CO2), an anthropogenic greenhouse gas. We measured the day-time column-averaged dry-air molar mixing ratios of atmospheric CO2, XCO2, in the central area of Tokyo during September 2014 – August 2016 using a desktop optical spectrum analyzer. The observed seasonal cycle is compared with the seasonal cycle that is observed at the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) site in Tsukuba, which is located 60 km to the northeastern direction of Tokyo. The differences in XCO2 between the two sites are high (∼5 ppm) during December – February and low (∼0.5 ppm) during June – September. The characteristic variations of XCO2 in Tokyo are interpreted in terms of local emission sources and surface meteorological data, by referring to the variations in the concentrations of surface CO2. The sharp peaks in XCO2 at both the Tokyo and Tsukuba sites in July are interpreted in terms of local air retention in the areas, as indicated by the aircraft profiles and wind-flow forward trajectory calculations. Finally, we compare the ground-based column measurements with the top-down satellite column observations. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={PM2.5 concentration fields that correspond to just meeting national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) are useful for characterizing exposure in regulatory assessments. Computationally efficient methods that incorporate predictions from photochemical grid models (PGMs) are needed to realistically project baseline concentration fields for these assessments. Thorough cross validation (CV) of hybrid spatial prediction models is also needed to better assess their predictive capability in sparsely monitored areas. In this study, a system for generating, evaluating, and projecting PM2.5 spatial fields to correspond with just meeting the PM2.5 NAAQS is developed and demonstrated. Results of ten-fold CV based on standard and spatial cluster withholding approaches indicate that performance of three spatial prediction models improves with decreasing distance to the nearest neighboring monitor, improved PGM performance, and increasing distance from sources of PM2.5 heterogeneity (e.g., complex terrain and fire). An air quality projection tool developed here is demonstrated to be effective for quickly projecting PM2.5 spatial fields to just meet NAAQS using realistic spatial response patterns based on air quality modeling. PM2.5 tends to be most responsive to primary PM2.5 emissions in urban areas, whereas response patterns are relatively smooth for NOx and SO2 emission changes. On average, PM2.5 is more responsive to changes in anthropogenic primary PM2.5 emissions than NOx and SO2 emissions in the contiguous U.S. © 2019},

abstract={In a changing climate it is expected that the predicted temperature rise will also affect wind conditions and parameters needed to determine atmospheric stability. In this paper we investigate how the changes in wind conditions and stability will affect the dispersion of airborne emissions. For odorous substances, the separation distances around livestock farms are calculated to protect the neighbourhood from odour annoyance. This is done for two Central European sites in Austria with different meteorological conditions, situated in areas with considerable livestock activity, namely around Wels in the north-alpine foreland and at Feldbach in the Raab valley south of the Alpine chain. Two climate scenarios have been used, namely the time period 1981–2010 (present climate) and the period 2036–2065 (future climate). Slight changes in wind and stability conditions for the two sites have been obtained, influencing the changes in separation distances. Although these are only minor, they show some interesting differences not expected a priori. We conclude that the climate change signal has mostly only a low impact on the separation distances. This will not substantially affect the zoning and licensing of livestock buildings in Austria in the course of this century. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Cavity receivers are the most usual design in solar dish concentrators in order to achieve high thermal performance. The objective of this work is the investigation of five different cavity receivers under different operating temperature levels and the selection of the most appropriate designs. More specifically, the examined cavities have the following shapes: cylindrical, rectangular, spherical, conical and cylindrical-conical. All the cavities are optimized in order to determine the best design which maximizes the thermal efficiency of the solar collector. The optimization variables are different for every design and they regard the cavity length, the cone angle and the distance from the concentrator base. According to the results, the best design is the novel one with cylindrical-conical shape, while the conical and the spherical are the next choices. The worst design is rectangular, while the cylindrical is the fourth design in the performance sequence. For operation at 300 °C, the cylindrical-conical design is found to have 67.95% thermal efficiency, 35.73% exergy efficiency while the optical efficiency is 85.42%. The analysis is conducted with a developed model in SolidWorks Flow Simulation which is validated with literature experimental data. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The transition of the manufacturing industry towards carbon neutrality requires a reduction of the emissions from combustion for the supply of process heat. Heat pumps are an efficient alternative technology for supplying heat while improving the overall efficiency and shifting to potentially carbon neutral electricity. The state-of-the-art technology is limited to supply temperatures between 100 °C and 150 °C because of lower efficiency and component limitations. This paper has therefore analyzed two promising concepts for higher supply temperatures and found technically and economically feasible solutions for process heat supply of up to 280 °C. These solutions are using large-scale equipment from oil and gas industries for applications in energy-intensive industries. The suggested systems benefitted from the economy of scale and access to low electricity prices. The concepts outperformed a biogas-based solution, and they were competitive with biomass or natural gas systems with respect to economic performance. It was concluded that an electricity-based heat supply is possible for a wide range of industrial applications and accordingly represents an important contribution to fulfilling the objectives of lower climate impact of energy supply in industry. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Wet deposition to Sweden has been measured on a monthly basis since 1955. Data from all national and international precipitation chemistry networks operating in Sweden during 1955–2017 was collected in one unique database. During 1990–2000, 146 sites were operated on average and the spatial distribution of deposition across Sweden was determined. The measurement sites were divided into three regions representing southwestern, southeastern and northern Sweden. The three regions clearly differ in deposition amount while the temporal variations were similar between the regions. Non-sea-salt sulphate (nss-SO42-) wet deposition reached a maximum around 1970 and ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3−) in the mid-1980s. There was a reasonable agreement between the decreasing wet deposition trends of NH4+ and nss-SO42-, during 1990–2016 and the estimated decrease in the emissions in Sweden and Europe. The decreasing wet deposition trend of NO3− was, however, weaker than the corresponding estimated reduction in emissions of NOx. The wet depositions of NH4+ and NO3− were similar in magnitude during the whole measurement period and distributed in a similar manner between the three regions despite that these pollutants are transported over long distances and that the sources and atmospheric chemistry for NHx and NOx are different. © 2019},

abstract={Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a potent neurotoxin responsible for many human intoxications globally. Despite its potency and widespread occurrence in taxonomically diverse species, the primary source of TTX remains uncertain. Paphies australis, an endemic clam found in New Zealand, has been found to contain TTX in several locations. However, it is unknown if this represents endogenous production or accumulation from an external source. To address this question, the concentrations of TTX in whole P. australis and dissected organs (siphons, foot, digestive gland and the ‘rest’) from thirteen sites around New Zealand were determined using liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS/MS). Depuration rate of TTX was also investigated by harvesting and measuring concentrations in P. australis maintained in captivity on a toxin-free diet every three to 15 days for 150 days. The LC-MS/MS analyses of the spatial samples showed that TTX was present in P. australis from all regions tested, with significantly (p &lt; 0.001) higher concentrations (15–50 μg kg −1 ) observed at lower latitudes of the North Island compared with trace levels (0.5–3 μg kg −1 ) in the South Island of New Zealand. Tetrodotoxin was detected in all the dissected organs but the siphons contained the highest concentrations of TTX at all sites analysed. A linear model of the depuration data identified a significant (p &lt; 0.001) decline in total TTX concentrations in P. australis over the study period. The siphons maintained the highest amount of TTX across the entire depuration study. The digestive glands contained low concentrations at the start of the experiment, but this depurated rapidly and only traces remained after 21 days. These results provide evidence to suggest that P. australis does not produce TTX endogenously but obtains the neurotoxin from an exogenous source (e.g., diet) with the source more prevalent in warmer northern waters. The association of higher TTX concentrations in shellfish with warmer environments raises concerns that this toxin's distribution and abundance could become an increasing human health issue with global warming. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={The use of antibody-based therapy to treat a variety of diseases and conditions is well documented. The use of antibodies as an antidote to treat tetanus infections was one of the first examples of immunotherapy and remains the standard of care for cases involving potential infections. Plasma-derived immunoglobulins obtained from human or horse pose risks of infection from undetectable emergent viruses or may cause anaphylaxis. Further, there is a lack of consistency between lots. In the search for new formulations, we obtained a series of clonally related human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from B cells sorted from donors that presented anti-tetanus neutralizing titers. Donors were revaccinated prior to blood collection. Different strategies were used for single-cell sorting, since it was challenging to identify cells at a very low frequency: memory B cell sorting using fluorescent-labeled tetanus toxoid and toxin as baits, and plasmablast sorting done shortly after revaccination. Screening of the recombinant mAbs with the whole tetanus toxin allowed us to select candidates with therapeutic potential, since mAbs to different domains can contribute additively to the neutralizing effect. Because of selective binding to different domains, we tested mAbs individually, or in mixtures of two or three, in the neutralizing in vivo assay specified by Pharmacopeia for the determination of polyclonal hyperimmune sera potency. An oligoclonal mixture of three human mAbs completely neutralized the toxin injected in the animals, signaling an important step for clinical mAb development. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Traffic related non-exhaust particulate sources and road dust are an increasingly important source for PM10 air pollution as exhaust sources are decreasing due to regulations. In the Nordic countries, the road dust problem is enhanced by use of studded tyres, causing increased road wear and winter road maintenance including gritting. Efforts to reduce road dust emissions requires knowledge on temporal and spatial road dust load dynamics. The city of Stockholm, Sweden, has therefore financed seasonal (October to May) road dust sampling to be able to optimize their winter and spring time street operation measures for reduced road dust emissions. This work describes the outcome of six seasons (2011/2012–2016/2017) of road dust sampling in five central streets using the VTI wet dust sampler (WDS).The results show that road dust load, expressed as DL180 (dust load smaller than 180 μm) has a seasonal variation with the highest loads (up to 200 g/m2) in late winter and early spring and a minimum (down to about 15 g/m2) in early autumn and late spring. The dust load varies between streets and is depending on pavement surface properties. On a smaller scale the dust load has a high variability across streets due to differences in rates of suspension from different parts of the road surface, with low amounts in wheel tracks and higher in-between and outside the tracks. Between 2 and 30% of the DL180 is smaller than 10 μm and could directly contribute to PM10 emissions. In general, higher road surface texture leads to higher dust loads, but the condition of the pavement (e.g. cracks, aggregate loss) might also have an effect. A new, wear resistant pavement accumulated markedly higher road dust amounts than a several years old pavement. This paper closes with a discussion on the complex relation between road dust load and PM10 concentrations and a discussion on the challenges and comparability of road dust sampling techniques and measures. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins broadly distributed in plants and have several biological functions, including antimicrobial action. Portulaca elatior is a Caatinga plant whose chemical composition and biotechnological potential have not been extensively studied. In this work, a lectin was isolated from P. elatior root extract and evaluated for antimicrobial activity. The P. elatior root lectin (PeRoL) showed native molecular mass of 33 kDa, pI 3.8 and is comprised of two subunits of 15 kDa linked by disulfide bonds. No sequence similarities with Viridiplantae proteins were observed. The PeRoL hemagglutinating activity (HA) was not affected by heating and was detected in a pH ranging from 4.0 to 8.0. Trehalose was identified as an endogenous inhibitor of PeRoL present in the roots. Bacteriostatic activity was detected against Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus (minimal inhibitory concentration of 8.1, 32.5 and 4.06 μg/mL, respectively). PeRoL induced the death of Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, and Candida tropicalis cells, with a minimal fungicidal concentration of 16 μg/mL. The lectin (100 μg/mL) was not cytotoxic to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and did not show hemolytic activity. In conclusion, the roots of P. elatior contain a trehalose-binding, thermostable, and antimicrobial lectin. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Wastewater treatment plants serve to collect and treat wastes that are known to include microplastic (MP; synthetic polymer materials <5 mm in size) and other small anthropogenic litter as particles, fibers and microbeads. Here, we determined the microplastic loads and removal efficiencies of three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with different treatment sizes, operations and service compositions discharging to Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, USA over the course of a year. Overall, we found that MP concentrations (counts per L) varied within a factor of 2.5 in influent and 4.8 in effluent at each WWTP, and that neither concentrations nor removal efficiencies demonstrated a seasonal trend. The largest wastewater treatment plant in the study, which also employed primary clarification, had the highest MP removal efficiency of 97.6 ± 1.2%. The other two smaller facilities had average removal efficiencies of 85.2 ± 6.0% and 85.5 ± 9.1%. We demonstrate through source modeling that microplastic fiber loads in influent were consistent with service area populations laundering textiles given previously published rates of microplastic generation in washing machines. Using measured WWTP flow rates and MP counts, we find a combined load of MPs leaving all three WWTPs with discharged effluent totaling 500–1000 million MPs per day. We estimate from this the emission of 0.34–0.68 g MP per capita per year in treated wastewater, which may only account for <0.1% of plastic debris input to this metropolitan area's surface waters on an annual mass basis when land-based (mis)managed plastic waste sources are also considered. However, the potential for sorption of chemicals present in wastewater to microplastics and their small size, which confers immediate bioaccessibility, may present unique toxicological risks for microplastics discharged from WWTPs. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Background: Internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm may be a good target for supraorbital keyhole clipping. We discuss the surgical indications and risks of keyhole clipping for ICA aneurysms based on long-term clinical and radiologic results. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 51 patients (aged 35–75 years, mean 62 years) with ICA aneurysms (mean 5.8 ± 1.8 mm) who underwent clipping via the supraorbital keyhole approach between 2005 and 2017. Neurologic and cognitive functions were examined by several methods, including the modified Rankin Scale and Mini-Mental Status Examination. The state of clipping was assessed 1 year and then every few years after the operation. Results: Complete clipping was confirmed in 45 patients (88.2%), dog-ear remnants behind the clip persisted in 4 patients, and wrapping was performed in 2 patients. Mean duration of postoperative hospitalization was 3.4 ± 6.9 days. The mean clinical follow-up period was 6.6 ± 3.2 years. The overall mortality was 0, and overall morbidity (modified Rankin Scale score ≥2 or Mini-Mental Status Examination <24) was 3.9%. Completely clipped aneurysms did not show any recurrence during the mean follow-up period of 6.3 ± 3.1 years, but the 2 (3.9%) aneurysms with neck remnants showed regrowth. Conclusions: The risk of neck remnant behind the clip blade is a drawback of supraorbital keyhole clipping. The surgical indication requires preoperative simulation and careful checking of the clip blade state is essential. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Source apportionment results from CAMx/PSAT v6.3 model simulation at an urban receptor placed in Milan city centre are presented. CAMx was run over a domain covering the Po valley for the calendar year of 2010. Model simulations considered nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and its primary and secondary components, i.e.: elemental carbon (EC) and nitrate (NO3−). Source apportionment results are separately reported with respect to emission regions (e.g.: local, urban, metropolitan areas, counties) and emission categories (e.g.: transport, space heating, industrial activities) and to the combination of emission regions and categories. Five emission regions were considered, starting from a narrow region covering Milan city centre, up to Milan municipality, Milan metropolitan area, Lombardy region, and to the entire Po valley. In terms of emission region contributions, Milan municipality, its metropolitan area, and Lombardy region account for about 60% of PM2.5 total mass at the selected receptor. However, local scale emissions contribute for more than 50% to EC ambient levels at this receptor. Conversely, the sources located in the farthest emission regions (Lombardy and Po valley) and long range transport determine the largest contribution (80%) to NO3− concentration. For NO2, local scale emissions are responsible for more than 60% of the ambient concentration levels in Milan city centre. In terms of source categories, traffic is the main contributor to NO2 and NO3−, biomass burning and traffic to EC and PM2.5 mass. The emission categories contributions to PM2.5 estimated by CAMx/PSAT for the selected receptor show a rather good agreement with Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) source apportionment results available for Milan area. However, the two approaches provide similar estimations only for biomass burning and traffic contributions (24% and 20%, respectively) whereas CAMx gives remarkably lower estimates for the share of secondary organic aerosol (SOA), likely because of missing formation processes in CAMx chemical module. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Size-fractionated aerosols were collected by a Micro-Orifice Uniform Deposit Impactor at an urban site in Shanghai during the autumn and winter of 2014. The results showed that the average concentration of PM1.8 increased from 49 μg m−3 in autumn to 74 μg m−3 in winter. By contrast, the relative contribution of the water-soluble inorganic species decreased from 40% in autumn to 31% in winter. This finding suggests that the increase of organic matter (OM) greatly contributed to the deterioration of particle pollution in winter. Compared to autumn, the concentration of sulfate decreased whereas the concentration of NH4Cl increased significantly and became an important constituent of the fine particles in winter. The formation of nitrate in autumn became significant at [NH4+]/[SO42−] &gt; 2, indicating that H2SO4 was fully neutralized by NH3 to form (NH4)2SO4. Our results showed that the regression between [NO3−]/[SO42−] and [NH4+]/[SO42−] drawn an unrealistic nitrate formation mechanism when the particulate NH4Cl was abundant. Replacing [NO3−] with {[NO3−]+[Cl−]} in the regression between [NO3−]/[SO42−] and [NH4+]/[SO42−], it is established that (NH4)2SO4 is preferentially formed before the excess available NH3 can react with HNO3 and HCl to form NH4NO3 and NH4Cl during wintertime. The concentrations of particulate sulfate and nitrate were not positively correlated with the ambient relative humidity, indicating that heterogeneous reactions on wet particles were not the key to haze formation in Shanghai during winter. Our results suggest that more studies are needed to understand the complex haze formation mechanisms in China. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Siderocalin/Lipocalin 2/Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalin/24p3 is an innate immune system protein with bacteriostatic activity, acting by tightly binding and sequestering diverse catecholate and mixed-type ferric siderophores from enteric bacteria and mycobacteria. Bacterial virulence achieved through siderophore modifications, or utilization of alternate siderophores, can be explained by evasion of Siderocalin binding. Siderocalin has also been implicated in a wide variety of disease processes, though often in seemingly contradictory ways, and has been proposed to bind to a broader array of ligands beyond siderophores. Using structural, directed mutational, and binding studies, we have sought to rigorously test, and fully elucidate, the Siderocalin recognition mechanism. Several proposed ligands fail to meet rigorous binding criteria, including the bacterial siderophore pyochelin, the iron-chelating catecholamine hormone norepinephrine, and the bacterial second messenger cyclic diguanylate monophosphate. While possessing a remarkably rigid structure, in principle simplifying analyses of ligand recognition, understanding Scn recognition is complicated by the observed conformational and stoichiometric plasticity, and instability, of its bona fide siderophore ligands. Since the role of Siderocalin at the early host/pathogen interface is to compete for bacterial ferric siderophores, we also analyzed how bacterial siderophore binding proteins and enzymes alternately recognize siderophores that efficiently bind to, or evade, Siderocalin sequestration – including determining the crystal structure of Bacillus cereus YfiY bound to schizokinen. These studies combine to refine the potential physiological functions of Siderocalin by defining its multiplexed recognition mechanism. © 2019},

abstract={Background: Machine learning (ML) is the application of specialized algorithms to datasets for trend delineation, categorization, or prediction. ML techniques have been traditionally applied to large, highly dimensional databases. Gliomas are a heterogeneous group of primary brain tumors, traditionally graded using histopathologic features. Recently, the World Health Organization proposed a novel grading system for gliomas incorporating molecular characteristics. We aimed to study whether ML could achieve accurate prognostication of 2-year mortality in a small, highly dimensional database of patients with glioma. Methods: We applied 3 ML techniques (artificial neural networks [ANNs], decision trees [DTs], and support vector machines [SVMs]) and classical logistic regression (LR) to a dataset consisting of 76 patients with glioma of all grades. We compared the effect of applying the algorithms to the raw database versus a database where only statistically significant features were included into the algorithmic inputs (feature selection). Results: Raw input consisted of 21 variables and achieved performance of accuracy/area (C.I.) under the curve of 70.7%/0.70 (49.9–88.5) for ANN, 68%/0.72 (53.4–90.4) for SVM, 66.7%/0.64 (43.6–85.0) for LR, and 65%/0.70 (51.6–89.5) for DT. Feature selected input consisted of 14 variables and achieved performance of 73.4%/0.75 (62.9–87.9) for ANN, 73.3%/0.74 (62.1–87.4) for SVM, 69.3%/0.73 (60.0–85.8) for LR, and 65.2%/0.63 (49.1–76.9) for DT. Conclusions: We demonstrate that these techniques can also be applied to small, highly dimensional datasets. Our ML techniques achieved reasonable performance compared with similar studies in the literature. Although local databases may be small versus larger cancer repositories, we demonstrate that ML techniques can still be applied to their analysis; however, traditional statistical methods are of similar benefit. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Recycling post-hydrothermal liquefaction wastewater (PHWW) may allow the use of nutrients in the aqueous phase that may otherwise go unused. PHWW is an attractive option for use as fertilizer in systems like crop production. However, there are potential contaminants in the PHWW that may inhibit crop growth or pose a food safety risk. This study investigated the concentrations of heavy metals and nutrients in the PHWW, as well as the presence of indicator pathogens. In addition, four different water treatment methods were used: (1) dilution of raw PHWW, (2) sand filtration after dilution, (3) sand and carbon filtration after dilution, and (4) reverse osmosis after dilution. Our results indicate that the concentrations of cadmium, lead, and arsenic in raw PHWW were well below the maximum recommended concentrations set by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) for Water Reuse. In addition, the treatment methods in this study achieved percent removals ranging from 82-100% for cadmium, 99-100% for mercury, 75-99.5% for lead, and 71-99% for arsenic. Nitrogen in raw PHWW was predominantly in the total N form, preventing it from being accessible to plants. After nitrification was induced, the concentration of NO3 + NO2 increased by 1.75 mg/L in the untreated 5% PHWW mixture, but remained unchanged or decreased for all other treatments and mixtures. There were no E. coli or coliform colonies detected in the raw PHWW, or in any PHWW mixtures. All PHWW mixtures with and without treatment are within US EPA guidelines for metals for irrigation water reuse. However, fertilizer supplementation may be required for PHWW to be suitable for crop production, as the low concentrations of NO3 + NO2 may prove challenging for growing crops. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Capacitive deionization (CDI) with electric double layers is an electrochemical desalination technology in which porous carbon electrodes are polarized to reversibly store ions. Planar composite CDI electrodes exhibit poor energetic performance due the resistance associated with salt depletion and tortuous diffusion in the macroporous structure. In this work, we investigate the impact of bi-tortuosity on desalination performance by etching macroporous patterns along the length of activated carbon porous electrodes in a flow-by CDI architecture. Capacitive electrodes were also coated with thin asymmetrically charged polyelectrolytes to improve ion-selectivity while maintaining the bitortuous macroporous channels. Under constant current operation, the equivalent circuit resistance in CDI cells operating with bi-tortuous electrodes was approximately 2.2 times less than a control cell with unpatterned electrodes, leading to significant increases in working capacitance (20–22 to 26.7–27.8 F g−1), round-trip efficiency (52–71 to 71–80%), and charge efficiency (33–59 to 35–67%). Improvements in these key performance indicators also translated to enhanced salt adsorption capacity, rate, and most importantly, the thermodynamic efficiency of salt separation (1.0–2.0 to 2.2–4.1%).

abstract={Regional to global river hydrodynamic models are now a reality, and have largely improved in the recent years due to increasing computation power, remote sensing datasets and new modeling methods. It is fundamental then to understand to which extent these models can provide locally relevant estimates of variables as discharge and water levels. It is addressed here by setting up three different versions of the large scale MGB hydrologic-hydrodynamic model with increasing spatial scale (global, regional and local), based on different topography datasets, cross section parameterization and reach lengths. These model versions are then compared to a detailed HEC-RAS model, set up with >620 locally surveyed cross sections in the Itajaí-Açu basin in Brazil. All models are run with calibrated rainfall-runoff parameters, so that effects of non-calibrated runoff fields or uncertain forcing data are not taken into consideration. To assist interpretation, three main requirements to define estimates from a river hydrodynamic model as locally relevant are defined: the model errors should be equal or smaller (i) than the accuracy requirement for a particular application and location, (ii) than typical local, reach scale models’ errors, and (iii) than observation uncertainties. Results then indicate that the regional and local MGB versions (and to a lesser extent, the global one) could estimate locally relevant discharges and water level anomalies for many parts of the basin. For absolute water levels, all models failed to provide RMSE smaller than 0.4 m basin-wide, although the local MGB model yields an average 2.1 m RMSE, in comparison to 4.4 m (regional) and 26.1 m (global). For flood extent, all model versions generally yielded unsatisfactory results with average Fit metric values smaller than 65%. Lastly, different setups of the regional MGB model were run to investigate the role of different factors in improving model estimates. Results showed that a coarse reach length (15 km) is unable to capture flood dynamics and water level variations in the basin, while a smaller 1 km long reach improves discharges, water level and flood extent. A locally derived DEM did not lead to significant improvements in relation to a global DEM. In turn, the smallest water level errors would be attained by using information from the in-situ cross sections in the regional models. This study's outcomes are encouraging for the future development of regional to global hydrodynamic models, with new remote sensing techniques and higher computational power improving cross section estimation and model discretization. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Background: We have been performing the clipping on crossed wrapping (COCW) method using 2 strips of cotton on patients with an internal carotid artery blood blister-like aneurysm (IC-BLA). This method is reliable in preventing the clips from slipping off and the aneurysm walls from being damaged during clipping, and it enables more appropriate and safer clipping. Here we report the technical details of this method and the long-term outcomes of patients receiving this procedure. Methods: Fifteen of 1275 (1.5%) patients with a ruptured cerebral aneurysm who received treatment at the Saiseikai Kumamoto Hospital during the period from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2016, had an IC-BLA. All 15 patients were treated with COCW, except for the first patient, who was treated using a single strip of cotton. The long-term outcome of the treatment was analyzed. Results: The mean follow-up period was 74 months. The first patient experienced rerupture of an aneurysm 10 days after the operation. No complications or regrowth of an aneurysm were observed in the remaining 14 patients during the follow-up period, except for 1 patient who received a reoperation for the regrowth of an aneurysm. As the final outcome, the numbers of patients with a Modified Rankin Score of 0, 3, and 6 were 13, 1, and 1, respectively. Conclusions: It is suggested that COCW is a treatment that enables safe and long-term management of lesions in IC-BLAs. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Snake venom may vary in composition and toxicity across the geographic distribution of a species. In the case of the three species of the Neotropical rattlesnakes Crotalus simus, C. culminatus and C. tzabcan recent research has revealed that their venoms can contain a neurotoxic component (crotoxin homologs), but is not always the case. In the present work, we detected and quantified crotoxin homologs in venom samples from three species distributed across Mexico, to describe variation at the individual and subspecific levels, using slot blot and ELISA immunoassays. We found that all C. simus individuals analyzed had substantial percentages of crotoxin homologs in their venoms (7.6–44.3%). In contrast, C. culminatus lacked them completely and six of ten individuals of the species C. tzabcan had low percentages (3.0–7.7%). We also found a direct relationship between the lethality of a venom and the percentage of crotoxin homologs it contained, indicating that the quantity of this component influences venom lethality in the rattlesnake C. simus. © 2019},

abstract={Nowadays more and more emphasis is placed on the protection of the natural environment. Scientists notice that global warming is associated with an increase of carbon dioxide emissions, which results inter alia fromthe combustion of gasoline, oil, and coal. To reduce the problemof pollution fromtransport, the EUis introducing increasingly stringent emission standardswhich should correspond to sustainable conditions of the environment during the operation of motor vehicles. The emissivity value of substances, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), as well as solid particles, was determined. The aim of this paper was to examine, by means of simulation in the Scilab program, the exhaust emissions generated by the 1.3MultiJet Fiat Panda diesel engine, and in particular, carbonmonoxide and nitrogen oxides (verified on the basis of laboratory tests). The Fiat Panda passenger car was selected for the test. The fuels supplied to the tested engine were diesel and FAME (fatty acid methyl esters). The Scilab program, which simulated the diesel engine operation, was the tool for analyzing the exhaust toxicity test. The combustion of biodiesel does not necessarily mean a smaller amount of exhaust emissions, as could be concluded on the basis of information contained in the subject literature. The obtained results were compared with the currently valid EURO-6 standard, for which the limit value for CO is 0.5 g/km, and for NOx -0.08 g/km, and it can be seen that the emission of carbon monoxide did not exceed the standards in any case examined. Unfortunately, when analyzing the total emissions of nitrogen oxides, the situation was completely the opposite and the emissions were exceeded by 20-30%. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Scientists and policymakers increasingly recognize that headwater regions contain numerous temporary streams that expand and contract in length, but accurately mapping and modeling dynamic stream networks remain a challenge. Flow intermittency sensors offer a relatively new approach to characterize wet stream length dynamics at high spatial and temporal resolutions. We installed 51 flow intermittency sensors at an average spacing of 40 m along the stream network of a high-relief, headwater catchment (33 ha) in the Valley and Ridge of southwest Virginia. The sensors recorded the presence or absence of water every 15 min for 10 months. Calculations of the wet network proportion from sensor data aligned with those from field measurements, confirming the efficacy of flow intermittency sensors. The fine temporal scale of the sensor data showed hysteresis in wet stream length: the wet network proportion was up to 50% greater on the rising limb of storm events than on the falling limb for dry antecedent conditions, at times with a delay of several hours between the maximum wet proportion and peak runoff at the catchment outlet. Less stream length hysteresis was evident for larger storms with higher event and antecedent precipitation that resulted in peak runoff > 15 mm/day. To assess spatial controls on stream wetting and drying, we performed a correlation analysis between flow duration at the sensor locations and common topographic metrics used in stream network modeling. Topography did not fully explain spatial variation in flow duration along the stream network. However, entrenched valleys had longer periods of flow on the rising limbs of events than unconfined reaches. In addition, large upslope contributing areas corresponded to higher flow duration on falling limbs. Future applications that explore the magnitude and drivers of stream length variability may provide further insights into solute and runoff generation processes in headwater regions. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The fireworks activity in Christmas and New Year is the culprit of a substantial increase in the particles pollution during those festivity dates in Mexico City. The fireworks’ thrilling explosions fill the air with small particles full of metals and organic and inorganic species, and noxious gases such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrous acid (HONO). The stagnant atmosphere at night accumulates the fireworks haze under a shallow boundary layer. By sunrise, once the fireworks activity has stopped, the photolysis of the abundant HONO accumulated throughout the night, leads to a rapid production of nitrate (NO3−), ammonium (NH4+), sulfate (SO42−) and low volatility secondary organic aerosols. This was the pattern observed during the winter of 2013–2014, when online measurements of water-soluble inorganic ions in particles smaller than 2.5 μm (PM2.5), non-refractory ions and organics in particles smaller than 1 μm (PM1), equivalent black carbon, and above-mentioned gases were conducted. The geometric average of the sum of the three major inorganic ions, NO3−, NH4+ and SO42− accounted for 25% (28%) and 34% (37%) of the total PM2.5 mass during the fireworks activity at night and the following morning on Christmas Day (New Year's Day), respectively. Similarly, their sum in the non-refractory fraction accounted for 37% (49%) and 47% (53%) of the total NR-PM1 mass concentration, while the organic fraction accounted for 56% (44%) and 49% (44%). Biomass burning organic aerosols and semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosols (BBOA and SV-OOA, respectively) dominated the organic fraction during the fireworks period at night, while the low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosols (LV-OOA) increased substantially their concentration along the post-firework hours the following morning. Concentrations of PM2.5 &gt; 100 μg m−3 and PM1 &gt; 50 μg m−3 were observed on both days, with maximums of 157 and 137 μg m−3 for PM2.5 and PM1, respectively. The meteorological conditions helped to reduce the fireworks impact by late afternoon on both days, limiting the firework episodes to 22 h.

abstract={Objective: Strategies to improve traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcomes in India are ill defined. The objective of this study was to examine baseline prehospital (PH) factors associated with outcomes from the Andhra Pradesh Traumatic Brain Injury Project. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of adult patients with TBI admitted to the primary referral hospital. Modes of injury, prehospital care and transport, and factors associated with increased in-hospital mortality were evaluated. Poisson regression with robust error variance and adjusted attributable risk percent estimates determined factors associated with outcomes. Results: A total of 447 adults (38% with mild TBI, 30% with moderate TBI, and 32% with severe TBI; 81% men) with isolated TBI (89%) from road traffic accidents (48.1%) or falls (46.5%) were enrolled. Of the patients, 45.7% were transported by ambulance, 61% had scalp/facial bleeding, 11% had respiratory distress, and 7% had cervical spine stabilization. Of these, 25.3% died and 34% had unfavorable outcomes. Among 335 direct admits, 45% traveled more than 50 km and nearly 20% traveled more than 100 km. Bleeding was associated with higher mortality (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05–2.31) and unfavorable outcome (aRR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.18–2.17). Of the patients, 45 (31%) with severe TBI received PH airway management prior to definitive treatment, and respiratory distress was associated with unfavorable discharge outcomes (aRR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.00–1.51). Conclusions: Patients with TBI often received treatment far away from injury, bypassing closer hospitals. Scalp/facial bleeding was common and associated with unfavorable outcomes. Ambulance use was infrequent, and few patients received PH airway management, hemorrhage control, or cervical spine stabilization when needed. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM) is the most visited National Park in the United States and has the highest levels of biodiversity of any park unit. It is a relatively small park (∼210,433 ha), but topographically complex, with an elevational range of 1757 m. The Park has historically been subject to elevated levels of pollutants, including sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Ozone trends are analyzed from 1989 to 2016 for six monitoring sites in and adjacent to GRSM and ranging in elevation from 564 m to 2030 m. Low-elevation sites have minimum O3 concentrations in early morning and maximum concentrations in mid-to late afternoon. High-elevation sites have flatter profiles, smaller diurnal ranges, and maxima that occur in early evening or at night. The W12624-h exposure index increases with elevation up to 823 m, after which it plateaus. W12624- h exposures increased between the years 1989–∼2002, and have substantially decreased afterwards. The highest 1-h concentration ever recorded in the Park was 135 ppb, which occurred on 25 August 1998. At most sites the maximum 3-month W12624-h exposures have shifted from mid-summer to spring (Apr–Jun). Decreases in exposure result primarily from reduction of hourly averaged O3 concentrations ≥ 60 ppb. Ozone episodes (3 or more consecutive hours when O3 ≥ 60 ppb) have decreased in frequency, magnitude, and duration from 1999 to 2016. Decreases in W126 exposures are correlated with lowered NOx emissions from regional TVA power plants and appear to be a direct result of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) call associated with the Clean Air Act Amendments, resulting in the cleanest air in GRSM over the period of record. Lower cumulative W126 O3 exposures and reduction in high O3 concentrations appear to be having beneficial effects on the vegetation within the Park. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Long- and short-term exposure to airborne pollutants results in adverse health effects. Regulatory monitors can be used to determine if regional concentrations meet regulatory standards of air pollution. As assessments of air pollutant exposure become more spatially resolved, evaluation is needed to assess the spatial representativeness of monitors in different environments. We measured NO2, ultrafine particle concentration (UFP), and PM1 with both stationary and mobile platforms in Pittsburgh, PA in 2016 and 2017. We sampled in eight ∼1 km2 neighborhoods representing different land use and exposure regimes (e.g., urban and suburban, high and low traffic). Mobile sampling was conducted on up to 25 days in each neighborhood to study fine-scale spatial variation in pollutant concentrations. NO2 exhibited within-neighborhood spatial variation, with hotspots elevated by up to a factor of 5 above the regional background. Spatial differences in UFP within the same 1 km2 neighborhoods could be a factor of 2.4 times regional background. PM1 was more regional and less spatially variable. Most neighborhoods exhibited less than 1 μg m−3 spatial variability in PM1. Spatial variability of NO2 and UFP showed moderate correlation (R2 &gt; 0.5) with traditional land use covariates such as traffic volume and restaurant density. We used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to calculate the fraction of each neighborhood represented by the same underlying concentration distribution. PM1 was the most spatially homogeneous, with 80–100% of each 1 km2 area being statistically similar to a reference location. Quantifying pollutant spatial patterns with high fidelity (e.g., &lt;2 ppb NO2 or &lt;1 μg m−3 PM1) seems unattainable in many urban areas unless the sampling network is significantly dense, with more than one or two nodes per km2. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Ozone production efficiency (OPE) represents the number of ozone (O3) molecules produced per molecule of NOx (NO2+NO), before NOx is converted to a sink or reservoir species. Observations from NASA's July 2011 DISCOVER-AQ (D-AQ) campaign in the Baltimore-Washington region are used to quantify OPE, which is compared to output from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. The baseline model run of CMAQ (CB05-TUCL mechanism; mobile NOx emissions from the National Emissions Inventory; biogenic emissions from BEIS model v3.61) underestimates observed OPE by 34 ± 20%. The payload of D-AQ lacked direct observations of HO2 and RO2, so we infer the rate at which these peroxy radicals react with NO (termed inROx) from observations of NO, NO2, O3, and j(NO2). The baseline run of CMAQ underestimates inROx by 35 ± 19%. A modified run of CMAQ with a factor of 10 reduction in the lifetime of organic nitrates, a factor of 2 reduction in mobile NOx emissions, an update to the thermal dissociation rate of PAN and PANX to the IUPAC 2014 value, and a correction for the rate constant for OH + PANX results in better overall model performance based on a number of comparisons to data that include column NO2 measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument, a value of OPE that is 21 ± 13% less than observed, and inROx that is low by 30 ± 19%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the peroxy radical discrepancy involves either emission of VOCs other than isoprene or HCHO, or a problem with the model production of HO2 and RO2. Our analysis suggests surface O3 may exhibit stronger declines to further reductions of NOx than is indicated by baseline runs of CMAQ.

abstract={The carbonaceous aerosol accounts for an important part of total aerosol mass, affects human health and climate through its effects on physical and chemical properties of the aerosol, yet the understanding of its atmospheric sources and sinks is still incomplete. This study shows the state-of-the-art in modelling carbonaceous aerosol over Europe by comparing simulations performed with seven chemical transport models (CTMs) currently in air quality assessments in Europe: CAMx, CHIMERE, CMAQ, EMEP/MSC-W, LOTOS-EUROS, MINNI and RCGC. The simulations were carried out in the framework of the EURODELTA III modelling exercise and were evaluated against field measurements from intensive campaigns of European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) and the European Integrated Project on Aerosol Cloud Climate and Air Quality Interactions (EUCAARI). Model simulations were performed over the same domain, using as much as possible the same input data and covering four seasons: summer (1–30 June 2006), winter (8 January – 4 February 2007), autumn (17 September- 15 October 2008) and spring (25 February - 26 March 2009). The analyses of models’ performances in prediction of elemental carbon (EC) for the four seasons and organic aerosol components (OA) for the last two seasons show that all models generally underestimate the measured concentrations. The maximum underestimation of EC is about 60% and up to about 80% for total organic matter (TOM). The underestimation of TOM outside of highly polluted area is a consequence of an underestimation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA), in particular of its main contributor: biogenic secondary aerosol (BSOA). This result is independent on the SOA modelling approach used and season. The concentrations and daily cycles of total primary organic matter (TPOM) are generally better reproduced by the models since they used the same anthropogenic emissions. However, the combination of emissions and model formulation leads to overestimate TPOM concentrations in 2009 for most of the models. All models capture relatively well the SOA daily cycles at rural stations mainly due to the spatial resolution used in the simulations. For the investigated carbonaceous aerosol compounds, the differences between the concentrations simulated by different models are lower than the differences between the concentrations simulated with a model for different seasons. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Sports nutrition products are developed and targeted mainly for athletes to improve their nutrient intake, performance, and muscle growth. The fastest growing consumer groups for these products are recreational sportspeople and lifestyle users. Although athletes may have elevated physiological protein requirements and they may benefit from dietary supplements, the evidence regarding the role of dietary protein and supplements in the nutrition of recreational sportspeople and sedentary populations is somewhat complex and contradictory. In high-protein diets, more undigested protein-derived constituents end up in the large intestine compared to moderate or low-protein diets, and hence, more bacterial amino acid metabolism takes place in the colon, having both positive and negative systemic and metabolic effects on the host. The aim of the present review is to summarize the impact of the high-protein products and diets on nutrition and health, in sportspeople and in sedentary consumers. We are opening the debate about the current protein intake recommendations, with an emphasis on evidence-based effects on intestinal microbiota and personalized guidelines regarding protein and amino acid supplementation in sportspeople and lifestyle consumers. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of liver diseases, of which the first stage is steatosis. It is one of the most common liver diseases in developed countries and there is a clear association between type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and NAFLD. It is estimated that 70% of people with T2DM have NAFLD and yet there is currently no licensed pharmacological agent to treat it. Whilst lifestyle modification may ameliorate liver fat, it is often difficult to achieve or sustain; thus, there is great interest in pharmacological treatments for NAFLD. Metformin is the first-line medication in the management of T2DM and evidence from animal and human studies has suggested that it may be useful in reducing liver fat via inhibition of lipogenesis and increased fatty acid oxidation. Findings from the majority of studies undertaken in rodent models clearly suggest that metformin may be a powerful therapeutic agent specifically to reduce liver fat accumulation; data from human studies are less convincing. In the present review we discuss the evidence for the specific effects of metformin treatment on liver fat accumulation in animal and human studies, as well as the underlying proposed mechanisms, to try and understand and reconcile the difference in findings between rodent and human work in this area. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Long-chain menaquinones (MK) are of bacterial origin. We investigated the possibility that MKs observed in honey are also the products of bacteria present in honey. The bacterial composition of honey was analyzed using culture-dependent methods. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and MALDI-TOF showed prevalence of the members of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus groups. The dominant menaquinones in both bacteria and honey were menaquinones MK-7 and MK-8 as indicated by UHPLC–ESI-MS/MS coupled to quadrupole orbitrap. The EICs showed alignment of mass ions of MK-7 and MK-8 from culture supernatants with that of honey. The unique MS/MS fragmentation pattern indicated that fragment ions were arising from the same menaquinone present in both samples. During Bacillus growth, the accumulation of MK-7 in supernatants occurred in a stationary phase and coincided with cell death. These novel findings suggest that the soluble MKs in honey originate from shedding of cell membranes of dead vegetative cells. © 2019},

abstract={This work aimed to evaluate the digestive stability of the peptides previously identified from a Corolase PP soy protein hydrolysate (SPH) and to respond to the uncertainty about the merit of controlled hydrolysis. For this purpose, we applied an empirical and theoretical analysis, determining peptide sequences, oxygen radical scavenging (ORAC) and ACE inhibitory (iACE) activities, and the effect of hydrolysis on solubility. Results showed that during digestion most of SPH peptides were degraded as smaller ones. However, both SPH bioactivities improved significantly after digestion (3.9 ± 0.1 μmol TE/mg protein for ORAC and IC 50 = 52 ± 4μg protein/mL for iACE) with similar values for soy protein isolate (SPI). With respect to solubility, the controlled hydrolysis considerably increased this functional property. In conclusion, the results indicated that controlled enzymatic hydrolysis of SPI with Corolase PP produced an ingredient more apt to be incorporated in certain nutritional or nutraceutical formulations. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Peanuts contain four major allergens with differences in allergenic potency. Thermal processing can influence the allergenic properties of peanuts. Until now, a kinetic model has not been reported to assess the changes of soluble allergen (extracted from processed peanuts) content as affected by various thermal processing methods. Our objective is to characterize the reaction kinetics of the thermal processing methods, including wet processing (boiling with/without high-pressure, steaming with/without high-pressure), deep-frying and dry processing (microwaving and roasting) using five time intervals. The relationships between processing time and extractable major allergen content could be explained by a simple linear regression kinetic model (except high-pressure steaming). Among all the methods with optimal processing point, frying for 6 min had a relatively lower IgE binding (linear epitopes) ratio, possibly due to the processing conditions, which caused break down, cross-linking and aggregation of Ara h 2, and a relatively lower solubility. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and peracetic acid (PAA) are being used for sanitization in food processing, but their chemical behaviors regarding disinfection byproducts (DBPs) formation during washing processes are still largely unknown. This study compared these two sanitizers in simulated washing processes for fresh-cut lettuce. Different doses of sanitizers were applied, and the wash water and washed lettuce were extracted and analyzed for 45 conventional and emerging DBPs of concern. Overall, washing by PAA generated much less DBPs than washing by NaOCl in both wash water and lettuce. Interestingly, the formation potentials of different groups of DBPs varied considerably in wash water versus in washed lettuce. This study is among the first to compare the two sanitizers for that many DBPs in both produce and wash water. The comprehensive data will facilitate the development of safer produce sanitization processes, and guide further research on DBPs in food. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Wine fraud leaves wineries vulnerable to damage in reputation and potential lost revenue. To reduce this risk for wines from Washington State (WA), USA, advanced analytical instrumentation and statistical methods were employed to geographically classify 133 wines from 4 major wine producing regions, including 70 wines from WA. Analyses of 37 elements and 2 water isotopes were performed with Triple Quadrupole Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry and Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy, respectively. Linear discriminant analysis resulted in 96.2% discrimination, achieved with 11 parameters (Mn, Zn, Pb, Ni, As, D/H, La, Ce, Si, Zr and Sr) that were linearly combined into 3 functions. WA wines were uniquely distinguished in large part with low D/H ratios and Mn concentrations derived from the isotopically light precipitation and volcanic loess soils encountered in this region, respectively. This study is the first of its kind to focus on the authentication of WA wines. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Caffeine and related purine alkaloids are common ingredients of many stimulating drinks. Studies have shown that lower concentrations of caffeine have a protective role in aging-related disorders. However, the associated mode of action of caffeine and its related methylxanthines is still not clear. In this study, we demonstrated that caffeine and theophylline promote longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Lifespan studies with the wild type, DAF-16 and SKN-1 mutant strains indicated that the methylxanthines-mediated lifespan extension in C. elegans was independent of DAF-16/FOXO and SKN-1. All the tested methylxanthines could protect C. elegans against acute oxidative stress. At early stages of life, an increase of ROS (reactive oxygen species) induced the translocation of DAF-16 and SKN-1, resulting in upregulation of several antioxidant genes, for example, sod-3p::GFP, gst-4p::GFP, gcs-1p::GFP; and downregulation of hsp-16.2p::GFP. RT-PCR corroborates the upregulation of gst-4 and skn-1 genes. The expression of DAF-16 decreased although its nuclear translocation was induced. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Sample preparation techniques, measurement routines and custom calibrations were developed and optimized for the quantification of Pb and additional heavy metals in dried and wet consumable vegetable tissues via WD-XRF and/or portable ED-XRF spectroscopy. After mitigating matrix influences fundamental to XRF quantification of heavy metals in a carbon matrix, the custom measurement and calibration routines were capable of detecting and quantifying Pb in dried prepared vegetable samples at concentrations relevant to the World Health Organization. The viability of each calibration was evaluated with measurements of vegetables grown in metals-rich garden soil collected from residential properties. Although robust calibrations for dried vegetables were obtained with WD-XRF, the slight compromise in the precision and accuracy of measurements with portable ED-XRF is offset by the portability of this technology. Heavy metal concentrations in wet coarsely-homogenized raw consumable vegetable tissues were quantified; however, further work is needed to test the viability of ED-XRF calibrations. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Rocket species (Eruca spp. and Diplotaxis spp.) are becoming increasingly important leafy salad crops across the world. Numerous scientific research papers have been published in recent years surrounding the potential health benefits associated with phytochemicals contained in leaves, such as flavonoids and isothiocyanates. Other research of note has also been conducted into the unique taste and flavour properties of leaves, which can be hot, peppery, bitter, and sweet depending upon the genotype and phytochemical composition. While research into these aspects is increasing, some studies lack cohesion and in-depth knowledge of commercial breeding and cultivation practices that makes interpretation and application of results difficult. This review draws together all significant research findings in these crops over the last five years, and highlights areas that require further exploration and/or resolution. We also advise on experimental considerations for these species to allow for more meaningful utilisation of findings in the commercial sector. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={The APOBEC3 family of deoxycytidine deaminases has the ability to restrict HIV-1 through deamination-dependent and deamination-independent mechanisms. Although the generation of mutations through deamination of cytosine to uracil in single-stranded HIV-1 (−) DNA is the dominant mechanism of restriction, the deaminase-independent mechanism additionally contributes. Previous observations indicate that APOBEC3 enzymes competitively bind the RNA template or reverse transcriptase (RT) and act as a roadblock to DNA polymerization. Here we studied how the deamination-independent inhibition of HIV-1 RT by APOBEC3C S188I, APOBEC3F, APOBEC3G, and APOBEC3H affected RT template switching. We found that APOBEC3F could promote template switching of RT, and this was dependent on the high affinity with which it bound nucleic acids, suggesting than an APOBEC3 “road-block” can force template switching. Our data demonstrate that the deamination-independent functions of APOBEC3 enzymes extend beyond only disrupting RT DNA polymerization. Since alterations to the RT template switching frequency can result in insertions or deletions, our data support a model in which APOBEC3 enzymes use multiple mechanisms to increase the probability of generating a mutated and nonfunctional virus in addition to cytosine deamination. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={The recent development of nanoscale fillers, such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and nanocellulose, allows the functionality of polymer nanocomposites to be controlled and enhanced. However, conventional synthesis methods of polymer nanocomposites cannot maximise the reinforcement of these nanofillers at high filler content. Approaches for the synthesis of high content filler polymer nanocomposites are suggested to facilitate future applications. The fabrication methods address the design of the polymer nanocomposite architecture, which encompasses one, two, and three dimensional morphologies. Factors that hamper the reinforcement of nanostructures, such as alignment, dispersion of the filler and interfacial bonding between the filler and polymer, are outlined. Using suitable approaches, maximum potential reinforcement of nanoscale fillers can be anticipated without limitations in orientation, dispersion, and the integrity of the filler particle-matrix interface. High filler content polymer composites containing emerging materials such as 2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes) are expected in the future. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Although new vehicles are designed to comply with specific emission regulations, their in-service performance would not necessarily achieve them due to wear-and-tear and improper maintenance, as well as tampering or failure of engine control and exhaust after-treatment systems. In addition, there is a lack of knowledge on how significantly these potential malfunctions affect vehicle performance. This study was therefore conducted to simulate the effect of various engine malfunctions on the fuel consumption and gaseous emissions of a 16-tonne Euro VI diesel truck using transient chassis dynamometer testing. The simulated malfunctions included those that would commonly occur in the intake, fuel injection, exhaust after-treatment and other systems. The results showed that all malfunctions increased fuel consumption except for the malfunction of EGR fully closed which reduced fuel consumption by 31%. The biggest increases in fuel consumption were caused by malfunctions in the intake system (16%–43%), followed by the exhaust after-treatment (6%–30%), fuel injection (4%–24%) and other systems (6%–11%). Regarding pollutant emissions, the effect of engine malfunctions on HC and CO emissions was insignificant, which remained unchanged or even reduced for most cases. An exception was EGR fully open which increased HC and CO emissions by 343% and 1124%, respectively. Contrary to HC and CO emissions, NO emissions were significantly increased by malfunctions. The largest increases in NO emissions were caused by malfunctions in the after-treatment system, ranging from 38% (SCR) to 1606% (DPF pressure sensor). Malfunctions in the fuel injection system (24%–1259%) and intercooler (438%–604%) could also increase NO emissions markedly. This study demonstrated clearly the importance of having properly functioning engine control and exhaust after-treatment systems to achieve the required performance of fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Oxysterols are derivatives of cholesterol and an important regulator of cholesterol metabolism, in part due to their role as ligands for nuclear receptors, such as the liver X receptors. Oxysterols are also known to be ligands for the RAR-related orphan receptors, involved in normal T cell differentiation. However, increasing evidence supports a role for oxysterols in the progression of several diseases. Here, we review recent developments in oxysterol research, highlighting the biological functions that oxysterols exert through their target nuclear receptors: the liver X receptors, estrogen receptors, RAR-related orphan receptors and the glucocorticoid receptor. We also bring the regulation of the immune system into the context of interaction between oxysterols and nuclear receptors, discussing the effect of such interaction on the pro-inflammatory function of macrophages and the development of T cells. Finally, we examine the impact that oxysterols have on various disease models, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis, stressing the role of nuclear receptors if previously identified. This review underscores the need to consider the multifaceted roles of oxysterols in terms of multiple receptor engagements and selective modulation of these receptors. © 2019},

abstract={An integral equation for crystallization kinetics that takes into account impingement and prevents the emergence of phantom nuclei is derived. We assume that crystallization proceeds by the growth of crystalline spherical domains, which develop from stable nuclei that emerge in the untransformed phase. In contrast to previous formulations, our approach does not require elaborate geometrical considerations or the need of concepts such as correlation functions or extended volume. Instead, by introducing two crystallization-dependent factors, we assume that nucleation and growth are restricted to the untransformed phase. It is shown that in the special case in which the nucleation rate is made constant, allowing in this way the emergence of unphysical phantom nuclei, our integral expression reduces to the classical Avrami exponential equation. It is found that this latter expression predicts values very close to those corresponding to the case in which phantom nuclei are not allowed to exist, confirming in this way the numerical insignificance of phantom nuclei. Geometric and kinetic arguments are given to shed light on this issue. For comparison purposes, it is illustrated that in the case of two-dimensional crystallization, phantom nuclei are slightly more relevant. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Data management in universities is a challenging endeavor in particular due to the diverse infrastructure of devices and software in combination with limited budget. Nevertheless, in particular the analytical measurements and data sets need to be stored if possible digitally and in a well-organized manner. This manuscript describes how scientists can achieve a data management workflow focusing on data capture and storage by small adaptions to commonly used systems. The presented method includes data transfer options from ubiquitous devices like NMR instruments, GC (MS) or LC (MS), IR and Raman, or mass spectrometers to a central server and the visualization of the available data files in an electronic lab notebook (ELN). The given instruments were chosen according to the needs of synthetic chemists, in particular devices needed in organic, inorganic and polymer chemistry where single data files in the range of several megabytes per data set are produced. Altogether, three different data transfer systems were elaborated to allow a flexible handling of different devices running with different proprietary software: The first procedure allows data capture via the use of a mail server as data exchange point. With the second procedure, data are automatically mirrored from a local file folder to a central storage server where new files are monitored and processed. The third procedure was designed to transfer data with manual support to a central server which is supervised to register new information. All components that are necessary to install and use the herein elaborated functions are available as Open Source and the designed workflows are described step by step to facilitate the adaption of procedures in other universities accordingly if desired. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Conservation laws in the form of elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental to the modeling of many problems such as heat transfer and flow in porous media. Many of such PDEs are stochastic due to the presence of uncertainty in the conductivity field. Based on the relation between stochastic diffusion processes and PDEs, Monte Carlo (MC) methods are available to solve these PDEs. These methods are especially relevant for cases where we are interested in the solution in a small subset of the domain. The existing MC methods based on the stochastic formulation require restrictively small time steps for high-variance conductivity fields. Moreover, in many applications the conductivity is piecewise constant and the existing methods are not readily applicable in these cases. Here we provide an algorithm to solve one-dimensional elliptic problems that bypasses these two limitations. The methodology is demonstrated using problems governed by deterministic and stochastic PDEs. It is shown that the method provides an efficient alternative to compute the statistical moments of the solution to a stochastic PDE at any point in the domain. A variance reduction scheme is proposed for applying the method for efficient mean calculations. © 2019 The Authors},

In addition to that, the 31 P MAS-NMR spectrum of the fully magnesium substituted glass showed the presence of amorphous magnesium pyrophosphate, Mg 2 P 2 O 7 . Al(IV) was the major Al species with small amount of Al(V) and Al(VI), but the amount of Al(V) increased with increase in magnesium substitution.

abstract={Inelastic x-ray scattering measurements using high-pressure apparatus were carried out for liquid Te up to 1673 K above the boiling point at the normal pressure. We could obtain the dynamic structure factor S(Q,E) of good quality at 1.8 ≤ Q ≤ 22 nm −1 . Although the excitation energies of the acoustic mode are fluctuating more at lower temperatures, we found that the dynamical sound speed at 1.8 and 2.1 nm −1 becomes fast with increasing temperature from 773 to 923 K, similarly to the temperature dependence of ultrasonic sound speed in liquid Te. Despite this unusual temperature dependence at the lowest Q, the sound speed at higher Q is consistent with those obtained by the previous inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering studies, in which the dynamical sound just slows down with increasing temperature. The present results may be correlated with the temperature-driven semiconductor-metal transition in liquid Te, and if so, it is inferred that a domain size of inhomogeneity induced with the transition is comparable to the wave length corresponding to the lowest Q. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Ultrasound reporting plays an important role in diagnosis as images produced during an ultrasound examination do not give the whole view of the medical conditions. However, in practice there are many issues that are inherent to ultrasound reporting and the most important was identified to be the lack of standardisation when producing these reports. There is a resistance to change from some radiologists preferring the free writing style, making any attempt to computerise the processing of these reports difficult. This paper explores the possibility of using Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) together with a domain ontology to transform free-form ultrasound reports into a structured form. It discusses a new approach in segmenting and identifying rhetorical relations that are more applicable to ultrasound reports from classical RST relations. The approach was evaluated on a sample ultrasound reports where the system's parsing was compared to the manual parsing performed by experts. The results show that discourse parsing using RST in ultrasound reports can be performed effectively using the support of a domain ontology. The results also demonstrate that the transformation of free-form ultrasound reports into a structured form can be performed with the support of RST relations identified and the domain ontology. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={We report lateral deformation experiments on rare earth substituted glasses from percalcic CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -Tm 2 O 3 . Using instrumented Berkovich indentation with normal loads below 100 mN, the scratch hardness was obtained from the work of lateral deformation per deformed volume in the elastic-plastic regime. The positive effect of rare-earth substitution on normal hardness, Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus was found to extent also to scratch hardness: in 25CaO-15Al 2 O 3 -60SiO 2 , partial replacement of alumina by Tm 2 O 3 leads to an enhancement of the scratch hardness by about 1 GPa per 2 mol% of substitution, reaching the highest values of scratch hardness which have been reported for oxide glasses thus far. The enhancement of scratch hardness is attributed to enhanced cation packing fraction and super-structural cohesion as a result of rare earth substitution. The previously reported linear correlation between scratch hardness and bulk modulus is confirmed. © 2019 The Authors},

The addition of Al 2 O 3 and Y 2 O 3 slightly decreases the rate of the glass crystallization. Surface crystallization occurs upon heat treatment. Crystallization was confirmed by the presence of sharp peaks in the XRD patterns of the glasses. Independently of the glass composition, different crystalline phases precipitate in the glasses upon heat treatment. The precipitation of the Na 1 O 7 P 2 Yb 1 crystal phase leads to an increase of the excited state 2 F 5/2 lifetime of Yb 3+ and also of the bandwidth of the Yb 3+ emission band centered at 1 μm. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={The Euler equations for inviscid and compressible flows are used for modeling interfacial instabilities, and in doing so all the physical dissipations are ignored under the consideration that they are extremely weak. However, numerical simulations of interfacial instabilities with numerical dissipations or with little dissipations suffer from nonphysical artifacts on the interfaces in late times of the interfacial developments. In this paper we introduce numerical dissipations for our previously developed conservative front-tracking method that simulate tangentially the missing physical dissipations in the Euler equations on the interfaces. Numerical examples show that they suppress numerical artifacts on the tracked interfaces and help to accomplish the simulations of interfacial instabilities on fine grids. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Glass foam is a cellular material with excellent thermal insulating ability. The thermal conductivity (λ) of cellular materials is complex to understand because it is determined by the composition of the solid and gas phases, pore size, solid microstructure (amorphous or crystalline, struts, and walls), and radiation. In this paper, we focus on the influence of gas composition on λ of glass foams. Glass foams were prepared by a physical foaming approach, where powder pellets of cathode ray tube (CRT) panel glass were sintered at 640 °C in Ar or N 2 atmosphere at elevated pressure (5–25 MPa), and then cooled down to room temperature. When heating the sintered samples to the viscous state (approx. 10 8 –10 6 Pa s corresponding to 650–740 °C), the high internal gas pressure in the closed pores expands the glass melt. We heat-treated each sintered sample multiple times in air at atmospheric pressure to gradually decrease the density, and thereby to obtain multiple λ values of each sample at different densities, while the chemistry of the sample remained almost identical. Gas chromatography revealed binary Ar-CO 2 and N 2 -CO 2 gas compositions in the Ar- and N 2 -sintered samples, respectively. The thermal conductivities of these gas mixtures (λ gas,mix ) were calculated to be 16.4 and 23.1 mW m −1 K −1 , presenting 22 and 31% of the effective λ for the Ar- and N 2 -sintered samples, respectively. The lower λ gas,mix resulted in a lower λ of the Ar-sintered samples compared to the N 2 -sintered ones at low density (&lt;0.6 g cm −3 ). Therefore, it is crucial to control the gas composition for tailoring λ of low density glass foams. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={FOAMGLAS® is a closed-cell glass insulation that has a high porosity, is impermeable, and can be heated above its glass transition temperature (Tg) without fracturing. Here, we characterize, using standard laboratory techniques, the thermal and transport properties of FOAMGLAS®, and report viscometry and calorimetry results. Based on this characterization, we propose that FOAMGLAS® be used as a proxy material in studies of the deformational behaviour of natural crystal-free melts populated with isolated bubbles. We demonstrate its utility with a case study: cores of FOAMGLAS® are deformed at high temperature (>Tg) in uniaxial compression. Deformed FOAMGLAS® samples record a different pattern of strain accumulation (volume loss vs. bulging) compared to deformed natural materials where bubble connectivity is high (e.g., sintered ash, vesicular lavas). The divergent behaviour can be ascribed to pressurization of the isolated gas-filled bubbles as a result of compression. The pressurized bubbles resist deformation, and expand when unloaded. In contrast, the high connectivity of open-cell foams allows gas escape and collapse of pore space during compression. The different behaviours of open- and closed-cell melt foams highlight the influence of isolated bubbles on magma rheology. These results demonstrate the utility of FOAMGLAS® as an experimental analogue for closed-cell bubble-rich magmas. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={A significant drawback of Lagrangian (particle-tracking) reactive transport models has been their inability to properly simulate interactions between solid and liquid chemical phases, such as dissolution and precipitation reactions. This work addresses that problem by implementing a mass-transfer algorithm between mobile and immobile sets of particles that allows aqueous species of reactant that are undergoing transport to interact with stationary solid species. This mass-transfer algorithm is demonstrated to solve the diffusion equation for an arbitrarily small level of diffusion and thus does not introduce any spurious mixing. The algorithm can be combined with random walks to simulate the desired total level of diffusion in a reactive transport system. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The Du Fort–Frankel scheme for the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation is shown to be equivalent, under a time-dependent unitary transformation, to the Ablowitz–Kruskal–Ladik scheme for the Klein–Gordon equation. The Schrödinger equation describes a non-relativistic quantum particle, while the Klein–Gordon equation describes a relativistic particle. The conditional convergence of the Du Fort–Frankel scheme to solutions of the Schrödinger equation arises because solutions of the Klein–Gordon equation only approximate solutions of the Schrödinger equation in the non-relativistic limit. The time-dependent unitary transformation is the discrete analog of the transformation that arises from seeking a non-relativistic limit using the interaction picture of quantum mechanics to decompose the Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian into the relativistic rest energy and a remainder. The Ablowitz–Kruskal–Ladik scheme is in turn decomposed into a quantum lattice gas automaton for the one-dimensional Dirac equation, which is also the one-dimensional discrete time quantum walk. This relativistic interpretation clarifies the origin of the known discrete invariant of the Du Fort–Frankel scheme as expressing conservation of probability for the 2-component wavefunction in the one-dimensional Dirac equation under discrete unitary evolution. It also leads to a second invariant, the matrix element of the evolution operator, whose imaginary part gives a discrete approximation to the expectation of the non-relativistic Schrödinger Hamiltonian. © 2019 The Author},

abstract={Perfluorinated C8-(PerfluoroC8) and bidentate anchored C8-(BDC8)-modified silica hydride stationary phases have been employed for the isocratic separation of homologous phenylalkanols and phenylalkylamines differing in their n-alkyl chain length, using aqueous-acetonitrile (ACN) mobile phases of different ACN contents from 10 to 90% (v/v) in 10% increments. These analytes showed reversed-phase (RP) retention behaviour with mobile phases of &lt;40% (v/v) ACN content with both stationary phases but with the BDC8 stationary phase providing longer retention. The PerfluoroC8, but not the BDC8, stationary phase also exhibited significant retention of these analytes under conditions typical of an aqueous normal phase (ANP) mode (i.e. with mobile phases of &gt;80% (v/v) ACN content), with the analytes exhibiting overall U-shape retention dependencies on the ACN content of the mobile phase. Further, these stationary phases showed differences in their selectivity behaviour with regard to the n-alkyl chain lengths of the different analytes. These observations could not be explained in terms of pK a , log P, molecular mass or linear solvation energy concepts. However, density functional theory (DFT) simulations provided a possible explanation for the observed selectivity trends, namely differences in the molecular geometries and structural organisation of the immobilised ligands of these two stationary phases under different solvational conditions. For mobile phase conditions favouring the RP mode, these DFT simulations revealed that interactions between adjacent BDC8 ligands occur, leading to a stationary phase with a more hydrophobic surface. Moreover, under mobile phase conditions favouring retention of the analytes in an ANP mode, these interactions of the bidentate-anchored C8 ligands resulted in hindered analyte access to potential ANP binding sites on the BDC8 stationary phase surface. With the PerfluoroC8 stationary phase, the DFT simulations revealed strong repulsion of individual perfluoroC8 ligand chains, with the perfluoroC8 ligands of this stationary phase existing in a more open brush-like state (and with a less hydrophobic surface) compared to the BDC8 ligands. These DFT simulation results anticipated the chromatographic findings that the phenylalkanols and phenylalkylamines had reduced retention in the RP mode with the PerfluoroC8 stationary phase. Moreover, the more open ligand structure of the PerfluoroC8 stationary phase enabled greater accessibility of the analytes to water solvated binding sites on the stationary phase surface under mobile phase conditions favouring an ANP retention mode, leading to retention of the analytes, particularly the smaller phenylalkylamines, via hydrogen bonding and electrostatic effects. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={This paper reports a rapid (5 min), low temperature (120 °C) method to platinize the counter electrodes of dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) devices. This new method uses aqueous solutions and is based on chemical bath deposition of an activating Pd layer followed by Pt only using H 2 gas as the reductant. This method has been tested on flexible, plastic substrates (indium tin oxide-coated polyethylene terephthalate or polyethylene naphthalate, ITO-PET or ITO-PEN, respectively). We report device efficiencies up to 7.2% on ITO-PET which is comparable to devices made using high temperature (400 °C) processing on rigid, fluoride-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass counter electrodes. The method is scalable and suitable for continuous roll-to-roll production. © 2018},

abstract={Topological constraint theory classifies network glasses into three categories, viz., flexible, isostatic, and stressed–rigid, where stressed–rigid glasses have more topological constraints than atomic degrees of freedom. Such over-constrained glasses are expected to exhibit some internal stress due to the competition among the redundant constraints. However, the nature and magnitude of this internal stress remain poorly characterized. Here, based on molecular dynamics simulations of a stressed–rigid sodium silicate glass, we present a new technique allowing us to directly compute the internal stress present within a glass network. We show that the internal stress comprises two main contributions: (i) a residual entropic stress that depends on the cooling rate and (ii) an intrinsic topological stress resulting from the over-constrained nature of the glass. Overall, these results provide a microscopic picture for the structural instability of over-constrained glasses. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Ge x S 100-x glasses with a wide compositional range of 10 ≤ x ≤ 43 (mol%) were prepared for the investigation and understanding of compositional trends of physical properties and structural features in this binary chalcogenide glasses. Both of mechanical and thermal properties were studied by the techniques of micro-indentation, resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, dilatometer, and DSC. The compositional evolution of network structure was discussed with the detailed investigation of Raman spectra. The thermo-mechanical properties, including hardness, thermal expansion coefficient, and elastic modulus, are firstly studied systematically in this binary glass system. Together with structural model theories, the correlation between thermo-mechanical properties and network structure of Ge x S 100-x glasses is established.

abstract={Population, intervention, comparison and outcome (PICO) facets of clinical studies are required both for physicians in a clinical setting and for reviewers as they compare the effectiveness of different treatment strategies. Automated methods developed for the first three of these facets identify entities, but outcome detection has been limited to identifying the entire sentence. We frame outcome detection as a noun phrase prediction task and use semi-supervised learning to detect new outcomes (aka endpoints) from the method section of 88 K MEDLINE abstracts. A manual analysis showed that 96.7% of all outcomes can be captured using a noun phrase representation. With respect to the machine learning classifiers, the Support Vector Machine produced higher precision, F1-score, and accuracy than the General Linear Model when evaluated with respect to the initial gold standard of survivorship seed terms and a manual gold standard that considered all outcomes. However, the best model does not employ machine learning, but rather leverages list structure and resulted in 90.14 precision, 60.69 recall, 75.41 F1-score, and 92.60 accuracy with respect to the manual gold standard of all outcomes. Finally we developed a silver standard with a precision of 89.28 and recall of 86.77 compared to the manual gold standard and used the silver standard to identify all outcomes reported for five breast cancer treatments. The increased precision afforded by this approach reveals that in contrast to chemotherapy and targeted therapy, the surrogate outcome disease free survival (DFS) is reported more frequently than the clinically relevant outcome overall survival (OS) for hormone therapies, which is consistent with findings that DFS translates into firm OS improvements in a hormone therapy setting. © 2019},

abstract={The pursuit of increased efficiency and quality of clinical care based on the analysis of workflow has seen the introduction of several modern technologies into medical environments. Electronic health records (EHRs) remain central to analysis of workflow, owing to their wide-ranging impact on clinical processes. The two most common interventions to facilitate EHR-related workflow analysis are automated location tracking using sensor-based technologies and EHR usage data logs. However, to maximize the potential of these technologies, and especially to facilitate workflow redesign, it is necessary to overlay these quantitative findings on the contextual data from qualitative methods such as ethnography. Such a complementary approach promises to yield more precise measures of clinical workflow that provide insights into how redesign could address inefficiencies. In this paper, we categorize clinical workflow in the Emergency Department (ED) into three types (perceived, real and ideal) to create a structured approach to workflow redesign using the available data. We use diverse data sources: sensor-based location tracking through Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), summary EHR usage data logs, and data from physician interviews augmented by direct observations (through clinician shadowing). Our goal is to discover inefficiencies and bottlenecks that can be addressed to achieve a more ideal workflow state relative to its real and perceived state. We thereby seek to demonstrate a novel data-driven approach toward iterative workflow redesign that generalizes for use in a variety of settings. We also propose types of targeted support or adjustments to offset some of the inefficiencies we noted. © 2019},

abstract={Porous glass tiles have been reacted with a low-surface energy coating to produce hydrophobic surfaces. Washing the surface with surfactant reduces hydrophobicity and the wetting state changes from Cassie-Baxter to Wenzel. Passing air through the porous glass when it is immersed in water causes a solid-gas-liquid interface to form and this is associated with recovery of hydrophobicity. The processing and microstructural characteristics of the porous glass that show this effect are reported. Potential applications include low-friction pipes, where maintaining the Cassie-Baxter state at the water-pipe interface would significantly reduce the energy required to transport water. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={We present a parallel hp-adaptive high order (spectral) discontinuous Galerkin method for approximation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The spatial discretization consists of equal-order polynomial approximations of the fluid velocity and pressure via discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretizations. For the nonlinear convective term we select the local Lax-Friedrichs flux, while for the divergence and gradient operators central fluxes are chosen. For the diffusive term, we use an interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin method to ensure stability and invertibility. The temporal discretization is an implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta method paired with a high-order splitting procedure to efficiently enforce the incompressibility condition at each time step. The compact stencil size, explicit time stepping of nonlinear terms, and inversion of sparse linear systems make the resulting method simple to parallelize while the local nature of the discontinuous Galerkin approximation makes hp-adaptive refinement natural to implement. We detail our implementation consisting of a tensor product basis of high order polynomials on quadrilateral elements, and implement hp-adaptivity using an inexpensive a posteriori error estimator to determine where refinement is necessary. p-Multigrid and pressure projection techniques are used to precondition the conjugate gradient linear solvers. We present several numerical tests to demonstrate the efficacy of the method, in particular in reducing the number of degrees of freedom needed and allocating computing resources to regions of sharp variation in transient incompressible Navier-Stokes flows. © 2019},

abstract={The interaction thermodynamics of the thrombin receptor agonistic peptide (TRAP-1), H-Ser-Phe-Leu-Leu-Arg-Asn-Pro-OH, and a set of alanine scan substitution peptides, have been investigated with an n-octadecylacrylic polymer-bonded porous silica (Sil-ODA 18 ) and water-acetonitrile mobile phases at temperatures ranging from 5 to 80 °C in 5 °C increments. The retention of these peptides on the Sil-ODA 18 stationary phase decreased as the water content in the mobile phase was lowered from 80% (v/v) to ca. 45% (v/v) and reached a minimum value for each peptide at a specific water-acetonitrile composition. Further decreases in the water content of the mobile phase led to increased retention. The magnitude of the changes in enthalpy of interaction, ΔH assoc 0 , changes in entropy of interaction, ΔS assoc 0 , and changes in heat capacity, ΔC p 0 , were found to be dependent on the molecular properties of the mobile phase, the temperature, the structure/mobility of the stationary phase, and the conformation and solvation state of the peptides. With water-rich mobile phases, the retention behaviour of the TRAP analogues was dominated by enthalpic processes, consistent with the participation of strong hydrogen bonding effects, but became dominated by entropic effects with acetonitrile-rich mobile phases as the temperature was increased. These changes in the retention behaviour of these TRAP peptides are consistent with the generation of water or acetonitrile clusters in the mobile phase depending on the volume fractions of the organic solvent as the Sil-ODA 18 stationary phase transitions from its crystalline to its isotropic state. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Titanate nanosheets (single layer, typically 200 nm lateral size) deposited from aqueous colloidal solution onto electrode surfaces form lamellar hosts that bind redox active molecular redox probes. Here, hydrophobic redox systems such as anthraquinone, 1-amino-anthraquinone, deca-methylferrocene, 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphine manganese (III) chloride (TPPMnCl), and α-tocopherol are shown to bind directly from cyclopentanone solution (and from other types of organic solvents) into the titanate nanosheet film. For anthraquinone derivatives, stable voltammetric responses are observed in aqueous media consistent with 2-electron 2-proton reduction, however, independent of the pH of the outside solution phase environments. For decamethylferrocene a gradual decay of the voltammetric response is observed, but for TPPMnCl a more stable voltammetric signal is seen when immersed in chloride containing (NaCl) electrolyte. α-Tocopherol exhibits chemically irreversible oxidation and is detected with 1 mM–20 mM linear range and approximately 10 −3 M concentration limit of detection. All redox processes exhibit an increase in current with increasing titanate film thickness and with increasing external electrolyte concentration. This and other observations suggest that important factors are analyte concentration and mobility within the titanate host, as well as ion exchange between titanate nanosheets and the outside electrolyte phase to maintain electroneutrality during voltammetric experiments. The lamellar titanate (with embedded tetrabutyl-ammonium cations) behaves like a hydrophobic host (for hydrophobic redox systems) similar to hydrophobic organic microphase systems. Potential for analytical applications is discussed. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Background: Hydrogen is received as an inert gas that thought to be non-functional in vivo previously. Recently, emerging evidences showed that in ischemia/reperfusion (IR) condition, hydrogen reduced cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ameliorated cell apoptosis. However, the underlying mechanism of hydrogen on IR-induced apoptosis remains elusive. Here we tried to unravel the mode of action of hydrogen with rat adrenal medulla cell line PC-12 in vitro. Methods: The mitochondrial functions before and after oxygen glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/RP) were determined with corresponding dyes. The expression of Bcl-2, Bax, VDAC1, cytochrome c and caspase 9 was detected using qRT-PCR and Western Blotting method. Then Bcl-2 inhibitor, AB-199, was applied to investigate the role of Bcl-2 in OGD/RP-induced cell apoptosis. Finally, we manipulated the expression of VDAC1 with plasmids transfection to understand the effects of VDAC1 on Bcl-2-mediated anti-apoptosis in OGD/RP. Results: In this study, we demonstrated that hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) reduced OGD/RP-mediated neuronal loss by stimulating the expression of Bcl-2, which suppressed the activity of VDAC1. Consequently, HRS maintained the mitochondrial functions, restrained the release of cytochrome c and caspase 9 activation, resulting in ameliorated cell viability. Conclusions: HRS ameliorated OGD/RP-induced PC-12 cell apoptosis and provided a novel treatment option for ischemia. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Cracking is one of the most serious and unfavorable phenomena in glass. To enhance the damage resistance of glass, methods for controlling factors related to cracking have been discussed for many years. In this brief review, various works on indentation-induced fracture in oxide glass are introduced and relevant issues regarding indentation techniques are discussed. In particular, various aspects of the indentation fracture (IF) method, which is a well-known empirical technique for evaluating the apparent fracture toughness of brittle materials, are discussed and it is emphasized that indentation techniques are powerful tools for comparing crack resistances between glass compositions. Finally, some novel approaches to analyzing indentation deformation and fracture in oxide glass are introduced to aid in understanding the brittle behaviors of glass and improving the mechanical properties of glass. © 2019 The Author},

abstract={We present the results of large scale simulations of 4th order nonlinear partial differential equations of diffusion type that are typically encountered when modeling dynamics of thin fluid films on substrates. The simulations are based on the alternate direction implicit (ADI)method, with the main part of the computational work carried out in the GPU computing environment. Efficient and accurate computations allow for simulations on large computational domains in three spatial dimensions (3D)and for long computational times. We apply the methods developed to the particular problem of instabilities of thin fluid films of nanoscale thickness. The large scale of the simulations minimizes the effects of boundaries, and also allows for simulating domains of the size encountered in published experiments. As an outcome, we can analyze the development of instabilities with an unprecedented level of detail. A particular focus is on analyzing the manner in which instability develops, in particular regarding differences between spinodal and nucleation types of dewetting for linearly unstable films, as well as instabilities of metastable films. Simulations in 3D allow for consideration of some recent results that were previously obtained in the 2D geometry [28]. Some of the new results include using Fourier transforms as well as topological invariants (Betti numbers)to distinguish the outcomes of spinodal and nucleation types of instabilities, describing in precise terms the complex processes that lead to the formation of satellite drops, as well as distinguishing the shape of the evolving film front in linearly unstable and metastable regimes. We also discuss direct comparison between simulations and available experimental results for nematic liquid crystal and polymer films. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={We present a new method for evolving the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (both Newtonian and relativistic) that is capable of maintaining a divergence-free magnetic field (∇⋅B=0) on adaptively refined, conformally moving meshes. The method relies on evolving the magnetic vector potential and then using it to reconstruct the magnetic fields. The advantage of this approach is that the vector potential is not subject to a constraint equation in the same way the magnetic field is, and so can be refined and moved in a straightforward way. We test this new method against a wide array of problems from simple Alfvén waves on a uniform grid to general relativistic MHD simulations of black hole accretion on a nested, spherical-polar grid. We find that the code produces accurate results and in all cases maintains a divergence-free magnetic field to machine precision. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={We present a multiscale continuous Galerkin (MSCG) method for the fast and accurate stochastic simulation and optimization of time-harmonic wave propagation through photonic crystals. The MSCG method exploits repeated patterns in the geometry to drastically decrease computational cost and incorporates the following ingredients: (1) a reference domain formulation that allows us to treat geometric variability resulting from manufacturing uncertainties; (2) a reduced basis approximation to solve the parametrized local subproblems; (3) a gradient computation of the objective function; and (4) a model and variance reduction technique that enables the accelerated computation of statistical outputs by exploiting the statistical correlation between the MSCG solution and the reduced basis approximation. The proposed method is thus well suited for both deterministic and stochastic simulations, as well as robust design of photonic crystals. We provide convergence and cost analysis of the MSCG method, as well as a simulation results for a waveguide T-splitter and a Z-bend to illustrate its advantages for stochastic simulation and robust design. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Thermoluminescence (TL) measurements for Gd 2 O 3 nanoparticles were carried out for various heating rates between 0.3 and 0.8 K/s at low temperatures (10–280 K). TL spectrum exhibited two observable and one faint peaks in the temperature region of 10–100 K, and four peaks in the temperature region of 160–280 K. Heating rate analysis was achieved to understand the behaviors of trap levels. It was seen that the peak maximum temperatures and TL intensities of all peaks increase with increasing heating rate. This behavior was ascribed to anomalous heating rate effect. T max − T exc. analysis was accomplished for TL peaks at relatively higher temperature region to reveal the related traps depths. T max − T exc. plot presented a staircase structure indicating that the TL glow curve is composed of well separated glow peaks. Mean activation energies of trapping centers corresponding to these separated peaks were found as 0.43, 0.50, 0.58 and 0.80 eV. © 2019},

abstract={Objective: To provide a theoretical basis for further development and utilization of the Thuja's resources, the composition and relative content of chemical constituents of essential oils from leaves of Thuja plicata and Thuja occidentalis from different provenances were analyzed. Method: The healthy 2-year-old seedlings with same size and consistent growth were selected as study materials. The volatile components of new leavesin the same position of seedlings from different provenances were extracted by solid-phase micro-extraction(SPME), and separated and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Qualitative analysis was carried out by mass spectrometry and the relative content of volatile components was calculatedby peak area normalization. Result: A total of 156 chemical components of essential oils of T.plicata and T.occdentalis were identified, among which 74 components were identified in T.plicata, and95 components in T.occdentalis. The volatile components of the two species from 10 provenances were dominated by monoterpenes, and the average relative content of T.plicata (80.258%) was higher than that of T.occdentalis (69.445%), but not forthe sesquiterpenoidsand other terpenoids.The two specieswere significantly differentin the composition of the essential oil. For example, 27 components were uniquely obtainedfrom 5 T.plicata provenancesand 35 components from 5 T.occdentalis provenances. There were only 6 common components in 10 provenances and their contents were significantly different The common components wereα-Thujone, γ-Terpinene, (8β, 13β)-13-methyl-17-Norkaur-15-ene, α, α-4-trimethyl-3-cyclohexene-1-methanol acetate, Caryophyllene and Hexadecanoic acidmethyl ester, respectively.The main components ofthe essential oildiffered obviously betweentwo species. The same main componentswere only thujone and β-phellandrene whichcontents were the highestinT.plicata and T.occdentalis. Conclusion: The chemical compositionand content of essential oils from leaves of T.plicata and T.occdentalis in different provenances weresignificantlydifferent, but the content of thujone was the highest in both species. © 2019, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

abstract={We propose a three dimensional Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin Maxwell approach for modeling Raman gain in fiber laser amplifiers. In contrast with popular beam propagation models, we are interested in a truly full vectorial approach. We apply the ultraweak DPG formulation, which is known to carry desirable properties for high-frequency wave propagation problems, to the coupled Maxwell signal/pump system and use a nonlinear iterative scheme to account for the Raman gain. This paper also introduces a novel and practical full-vectorial formulation of the electric polarization term for Raman gain that emphasizes the fact that the computer modeler is only given a measured bulk Raman gain coefficient. Our results provide promising qualitative corroboration of the model and methodology used. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Pentacoordinated silicon (SiO 5 ) has long been considered as a possible reactive intermediate in bond-swapping reactions in even ambient pressure viscous flow, diffusion, nucleation and crystallization. In this paper, new results are presented for potassium silicate glasses and for two lithium silicates. In the former, SiO 5 is readily detectable by 29 Si MAS NMR on 29 Si-enriched glasses at concentrations as low as about 0.02 mol%; in the latter this species is below detection limits. SiO 5 concentrations are higher at higher fictive temperatures, and first increase, then decrease, as K 2 O is added to SiO 2 . This pattern in compositional variation resembles those long-known in alkali borate and germanates, although high coordinate species (BO 4 and GeO 5 /GeO 6 ) are orders of magnitude more abundant than in ambient pressure silicates. A simple thermodynamic model, considering only the non-ideal mixing of bridging and non-bridging oxygens, at least qualitatively predicts the shape of the compositional variation of SiO 5 in the potassium silicates, and is sensible with respect to known tendencies for clustering and unmixing; such a model also predicts curves of network cation coordination vs. compositon that resemble those known for borates and germanates, suggesting an underlying similarity in the energetics of mixing of anionic species. © 2019 The Author},

abstract={Non-targeted analysis is nowadays applied in many different domains of analytical chemistry such as metabolomics, environmental and food analysis. Conventional processing strategies for GC-MS data include baseline correction, feature detection, and retention time alignment before multivariate modeling. These techniques can be prone to errors and therefore time-consuming manual corrections are generally necessary. We introduce here a novel fully automated approach to non-targeted GC-MS data processing. This new approach avoids feature extraction and retention time alignment. Supervised machine learning on decomposed tensors of segmented chromatographic raw data signal is used to rank regions in the chromatograms contributing to differentiation between sample classes. The performance of this novel data analysis approach is demonstrated on three published datasets. © 2019},

abstract={During the last few years, World Health Organisation (WHO) has emphasized for the quality control for herbal drugs. The present study was designed and executed to check the heavy metal ions content in the most commonly used Ayurvedic/herbal drugs in Indian Ayurvedic hospitals. Based upon the medicinal applications, we have examined 23 most common and important drug sample contained 7 vati, 5 guggulu, 7 churna, and 4 lauha samples. Essential metal ions, antioxidant and protein binding qualities of drug samples under study were analyzed. Metal ions (heavy metal and essential metal ions) were determined by using the Inductive Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The antioxidant potential was evaluated through spectrophotometric analysis by using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), metal chelating (MC), ferric reducing (FRAP), Scavenging activity of superoxide anion (SA) and nitric oxide (NO) assays. The observed total phenolic content of the samples varied from 14.91 to 208.34 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g dry weight (DW) of sample(s). The values of total flavanoids content were varied from 48.0 to 208.0 mg quercetin equivalent (QE)/g DW of sample(s). As, compared to control (ascorbic acid), herbal drug samples have shown excellent antioxidant activities over a range from 40.51 to 92.34%. The observed protein binding constants values were almost close to control (aspirin). It was noticed that maximum drugs have a good source of essential metal ions like Na, Mg, Ca, Fe, Cu, Zn etc. The observed concentration values for the heavy metal ions were within the prescribed limits of WHO and API. Only two drugs contained aluminium concentrations more than 50 mg/kg. These findings may validate and boost up the quality control process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In recent years, the commercialization of hybrid ion mobility-mass spectrometers and their integration in traditional LC-MS workflows provide new opportunities to extend the current boundaries of targeted and non-targeted analyses. When coupled to LC-MS, ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) provides a novel characterization parameter, the so-called averaged collision cross section (CCS, Ω), as well as improves method selectivity and sensitivity by the separation of isobaric and isomeric molecules and the isolation of the analytes of interest from background noise. In this work, we have explored the potential and advantages of this technology for carrying out the determination of phase II steroid metabolites (i.e. androgen and estrogen conjugates, including glucuronide and sulfate compounds; n = 25) in urine samples. These molecules have been selected based on their relevance in the fields of chemical food safety and doping control, as well as in metabolomics studies. The influence of urine matrix on the CCS of steroid metabolites was evaluated in order to give more confidence to current CCS databases and support its use as complementary information to retention time (Rt) and mass spectra for compound identification. Samples were only diluted 10-fold with aqueous formic acid (0.1%, v/v) prior analysis. Only an almost insignificant effect of adult bovine urine matrix on the CCS of certain steroid metabolites was observed in comparison with calve urine matrix, which is a less complex sample. In addition, high accuracy was achieved for CCS measurements carried out over four months (ΔCCS < 1.3% for 99.8% of CCS measurements; n = 1806). Interestingly, it has been observed that signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio could be improved at least 2 or 7-fold when IMS is combined with LC-MS. In addition to the separation of isomeric steroid pairs (i.e. etiocholanolone glucuronide and epiandrosterone glucuronide, as well as 19-noretiocholanolone glucuronide and 19-norandrosterone glucuronide), steroid-based ions were also separated in the IMS dimension from co-eluting matrix compounds that presented similar mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). Finally, based on CCS measurements and as a proof of concept, 17α-boldenone glucuronide has been identified as one of the main metabolites resulted from boldione administration to calves. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are classified at a highest degree of threat in biodefense, due largely to their high lethality. With the growing risk of biowarfare, the shortcomings of the gold standard test for these neurotoxins, the mouse bioassay, have underscored the need to develop alternative diagnostic testing strategies. This paper reports on the detection of inactivated Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT-A) and serotype B (BoNT-B), the two most important markers of botulism infection, by using a sandwich immunoassay, gold nanoparticle labels, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) within the context of two threat scenarios. The first scenario mimics part of the analysis needed in response to a “white powder” threat by measuring both neurotoxins in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), a biocompatible solvent often used to recover markers dispersed in a powdered matrix. The second scenario detects the two neurotoxins in spiked human serum to assess the clinical potential of the platform. The overall goal is to develop a test applicable to both scenarios in terms of projections of required levels of detection. We demonstrate the ability to measure BoNT-A and BoNT-B in PBS at a limit of detection (LoD) of 700 pg/mL (5 pM) and 84 pg/mL (0.6 pM), respectively, and in human serum at 1200 pg/mL (8 pM) and 91 pg/mL (0.6 pM), respectively, with a time to result under 24 h. The steps required to transform this platform into an onsite biodefense screening tool that can simultaneously and rapidly detect (<1 h) these and other agents are briefly discussed. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Al 86 Ce 10 TM 4 amorphous alloys (TM = Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu; where the alloys are denoted by A 1 ~A 7 , respectively) were fabricated using melt-spin fast-quenching method. The glass-forming ability (GFA), thermal stability (TS), and mechanical and corrosion behavior of the as-spun alloys were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy - energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), micro-indentation and electrochemical techniques. It was found Al and Ce microalloyed with Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu, respectively enhance glass formation, thus the as-spun Al 86 Ce 10 TM 4 alloys form an amorphous matrix embedded with short range ordered (SRO) Al-TM, Al-Ce and Al-Ce-TM quasi-crystalline clusters due to a strong heteroatomic interaction related to a covalent character of atomic bonds (for A 1 ~A 7 ) or/and inlaid with face-centered-cubic aluminum (FCC-Al) nano-crystallites which were precipitated during the melt-spin quenching (for A 1 ~A 3 ). The GFA of the alloys ranks in the sequence of A 4 &gt; A 5 &gt; A 6 &gt; A 7 &gt; A 2 &gt; A 3 &gt; A 1 which can be assessed by the supercooled liquid region ΔT m (=T m -T x ) the reduced glass transition temperature T rg (=T g /T m ), and other criteria such as γ′ = T x /(T g + T m ), δ′ = T x /(T m − T g ), β′ = T x T g /(T m + T x ) 2 , and ω′ = T m (T m + T x )/(T x (T m − T x )); while the TS of the alloys lists in the series of A 5 &gt; A 6 ~ A 4 &gt; A 7 &gt; A 3 &gt; A 2 &gt; A 1 that can be evaluated by the first crystallization activation energy E c , first crystallization activation enthalpy ΔH ⁎ , frequency factor K o , fragility parameter m, and theoretical glass transition temperature T g ⁎ . The hardness of the alloys A 1 ~A 7 accounts to 707, 809, 940, 863, 762, 809, and 715 MPa, respectively, attributing to a composite structure consisting of an amorphous matrix tessellated with SRO quasi-crystalline clusters or/and FCC-Al nano-crystallites. In addition, the alloys exhibit high corrosion resistance in the rate of 10 −7 –10 −8 A/cm 2 with a large passivation scope except that the alloy A 7 presents a corrosion rate of 10 −6 A/cm 2 with an active anodic dissolution behavior. The results manifest the Al 86 Ce 10 TM 4 alloys can be fabricated into a unique composite consisting of an amorphous matrix embedded with SRO quasi-crystalline or/and nano-crystalline phases which confers high mechanical hardness and corrosion resistance for potential engineering applications. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Small organic molecules are used as solution additives in electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to increase the charge states of protein ions and improve the performance of intact protein analysis by tandem mass spectrometry. The properties of the additives that are responsible for their charge-enhancing effects (e.g. dipole moment, gas-phase basicity, Brønsted basicity, and surface tension) have been debated in the literature. We report a series of solution additives for ESI-MS based on cyclic alkyl carbonates and sulphites that have alkyl chains that are from two to ten methylene units long. The extent of charging of [Val [5]]-angiotensin II, cytochrome c, carbonic anhydrase II, and bovine serum albumin in ESI-MS using the additives was measured. For both the alkyl carbonate and sulphite additives with up to four methylene units, ion charging increased as the side chain lengths of the additives increased. At a critical alkyl chain length of four methylene units, protein ion charge states decreased as the chain length increased. The dipole moments, gas-phase basicity values, and Brønsted basicities (i.e. the pK a of the conjugate acids) of the additives were obtained using electronic structure calculations, and the surface tensions were measured by pendant drop tensiometry. Because the dipole moments, gas-phase basicities, and pK a values of the additives did not depend significantly on the alkyl chain lengths of the additives and the extent of charging depended strongly on the chain lengths, these data indicate that these three additive properties do not correlate with protein charging under these conditions. For the additives with alkyl chains at or above the critical length, the surface tension of the additives decreased as the length of the side chain decreased, which correlated well with the decrease in protein charging. These data are consistent with protein charging being limited by droplet surface tension below a threshold surface tension for these additives. For additives with relatively high surface tensions, protein ion charging increased as the amphiphilicity of the additives increased (and surface tension decreased) which is consistent with protein charging being limited by the emission of charge carriers from highly charged ESI generated droplets. © 2018},

abstract={Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a proinflammatory mediator, is recognized as a player in inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Cyclophosphamide (CYP) results in bladder inflammation and pain and it's a frequently used animal model of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). Because pretreatment with a MIF inhibitor (ISO-1) prevented both CYP-induced bladder pain and inflammation we used genetic MIF knockout (KO) mice to further investigate MIF's role in CYP-induced bladder pain and inflammation. Abdominal mechanical threshold measured bladder pain induced by CYP in wild type (WT) and MIF KO mice at several time points (0–48 h). End-point (48 h) changes in micturition parameters and histological signs of bladder inflammation were also evaluated. Abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity developed within 4 h after CYP injection (and lasted for the entire observation period: 48 h) in WT mice. MIF KO mice, on the other hand, did not develop abdominal mechanical hypersensitivity suggesting that MIF is a pivotal molecule in mediating CYP-induced bladder pain. Both WT and MIF KO mice treated with CYP showed histological signs of marked bladder inflammation and showed a significant decrease in micturition volume and increase in frequency. Since both changes were blocked in MIF KO mice by pretreatment with a MIF inhibitor (ISO-1) it is likely these are non-specific effects of ISO-1. MIF mediates CYP-induced bladder pain but not CYP-induced bladder inflammation. The locus of effect (bladder) or central (spinal) for MIF mediation of bladder pain remains to be determined. © 2019},

abstract={The main drinking water source supplying Uruguay (Santa Lucía River, SLR) was threatened in 2013 by a cyanobacterial bloom transported downstream to the water treatment plant that provides water to half of this country population. Several eutrophic reservoirs and stabilization ponds located in the river basin may have been the source of cyanobacterial populations. Such conditions may be common in productive basins; however, few studies have evaluated the impact of microalgae from wastewater stabilization ponds on rivers and its viability downstream. The effect of a dairy wastewater effluent on SLR was studied by means of nutrient and chlorophyll a loads, phytoplankton composition, and effluent incubation in river water in order to evaluate the potential development of cyanobacteria. Total phosphorus and nitrogen loads of the effluent reached up to 25% and 17% of SLR, respectively, while chlorophyll a was up to 37%. The upstream-downstream evaluation showed an increase in dissolved phosphorus and chlorophyll a. The effluent phytoplankton (14.16 mm 3  L −1 ) was dominated by organisms &lt; 10 μm and diatoms (91%), and 3% of cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria were not detected in SLR, though it appeared downstream of the effluent discharge. At the end of the bioassay, cyanobacterial biomass became the dominant group (37%). This study shows the potential development of cyanobacteria present in industrial effluents when diluted in river water. The effect of phytoplankton discharge from stabilization ponds is not generally considered in monitoring assessments and environment management, despite representing a particular risk if the water body is used as a drinking water source. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Improving the fracture resistance of oxide glasses through adjustment of the chemical composition remains a challenging task, although composition-mechanical property relations have been established for simple model systems. The glass mechanical properties are, among other methods, conventionally tested using instrumented indentation, which is a fast and convenient technique that mimics the real-life damage for certain applications, although interpretation can be challenging due to the complex stress fields that develop under the indenter. Early indentation experiments have shown that oxide glasses exhibit pronounced tendency to densify under compressive load compared to metals and ceramics. After decades of investigations, it is now known that the extent of densification is strongly dependent on the glass’ chemical composition and in turn its atomic packing density and Poisson's ratio. Spectroscopic techniques have shed light on the mechanism of densification, which include changes in the bond angle distributions as well as an increase in the coordination number of the network-forming cations. Knowledge of such details is crucial for understanding the link between chemical composition and resistance to cracking in oxide glasses, since densification is an efficient way to dissipate the elastic energy applied to the material during indentation. Here, we review the experimental work on identification and quantification of indentation deformation in glasses, as well as on probing the accompanying structural changes in the glassy network. We also include the conclusions drawn from computer simulation studies, which can provide atomistic details of the indentation deformation mechanisms. Finally, we discuss the link between the mechanism of deformation and the crack resistance. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Host immunity is crucial for controlling M. tuberculosis infection. Functional polymorphisms in the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) show global population stratification, with the highest prevalence of low expression MIF alleles found in sub-Saharan Africans, which is a population with the greatest confluence of both TB and HIV infection and disease. We investigated the association between MIF alleles and tuberculosis (TB) and HIV in South Africa. We acquired clinical information and determined the frequency of two MIF promoter variants: a functional −794 CATT 5-8 microsatellite and an associated −173 G/C SNP in two HIV-positive cohorts of patients with active laboratory-confirmed TB and in controls without active TB who were all HIV positive. We found a greater frequency of low expression MIF promoter variants (-794 CATT 5,6 ) among TB disease cases compared to controls (OR = 2.03, p = 0.023), supporting a contribution of genetic low MIF expression to the high prevalence of TB in South Africa. Among those with HIV, circulating MIF levels also were associated with lower CD4 cell counts irrespective of TB status (p = 0.016), suggesting an influence of HIV immunosuppression on MIF expression. © 2019},

abstract={Cyclophilin (Cyp), a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase), acts as a virulence factor in many bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus. The enzymatic activity of Cyp is inhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug. To precisely determine the unfolding mechanism and the domain structure of Cyp, we have investigated a chimeric S. aureus Cyp (rCyp) using various probes. Our limited proteolysis and the consequent analysis of the proteolytic fragments indicate that rCyp is composed of one domain with a short flexible tail at the C-terminal end. We also show that the urea-induced unfolding of both rCyp and rCyp-CsA is completely reversible and proceeds via the synthesis of at least one stable intermediate. Both the secondary structure and the tertiary structure of each intermediate appears very similar to those of the corresponding native protein. Conversely, the hydrophobic surface areas of the intermediates are comparatively less. Further analyses reveal no loss of CsA binding activity in rCyp intermediate. The thermodynamic stability of rCyp was also significantly increased in the presence of CsA, recommending that this protein could be employed to screen new CsA derivatives in the future. © 2019 Seal et al.

abstract={Standard methods for detecting cancer-associated genes rely on comparison of sample means between cancer patients and healthy controls. While such methods have successfully identified several oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, they neglect to account for heterogeneity within the cancer population. Genetic mutations, translocations, and amplifications are often inconsistent across tumors, and instead they often affect smaller subsets of patients. This concept gives rise to the idea of bimodally expressed genes, or genes that display two modes of expression within one population. Analysis of bimodal gene expression has been explored via a variety of techniques including test statistics and clustering. In this review, we summarize the methodologies used to quantify bimodal gene expression and address the utility of these genes in patient stratification and specialized therapeutics in breast and lung cancer. Finally we discuss the limitations and future directions for bimodal genes in the era of high-throughput sequencing and personalized medicine. © 2018},

abstract={Inflammation of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) tissues are the most common cause of pain conditions associated with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). After a tissue and/or neural damage, the inflammatory response is characterized by plasma extravasation and leukocytes infiltration in the TMJ tissues, which in turn, release inflammatory cytokines cascades responsible for inflammatory pain. Lectins are glycoproteins widely distributed in nature that may exhibit anti-inflammatory properties. This study demonstrated by molecular docking and MM/PBSA that the lectin from Dioclea violacea (DVL) interacts favorably with α-methyl-D-mannoside, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, and core1-sialyl-Lewis X which are associated with leukocytes migration during an inflammatory response. Wistar rats pretreated with intravenously injection of DVL demonstrated a significant inhibition of plasma extravasation induced by carrageenan (a non-neurogenic inflammatory inductor) and mustard oil (a neurogenic inflammatory inductor) in the TMJ periarticular tissues (p < 0.05; ANOVA, Tukey's test). In addition, DVL significantly reduced carrageenan-induced leukocyte migration in the TMJ periarticular tissues mediated by down-regulation of ICAM-1 expression. These results suggest a potential anti-inflammatory effect of DVL in inflammatory conditions of TMJ. © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM)},

abstract={Classical myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) include polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). MPN has been defined as a chronic inflammation-driven tumor model. It is clear that there is a close link between chronic inflammation and MPN pathogenesis. Several studies have demonstrated cytokine profiles in MPN patients. Other studies have used cell lines or animal models aiming to clarify the underlying mechanism of cytokines in the pathogenesis of MPN. However, important questions remain: (1) among all these cytokines, which are more predictive? and (2) which are more critical? In this review, we summarize cytokines that have been investigated in MPN and highlight several cytokines that may be more significant in MPN. We suggest that cytokines are more critical in PMF than PV or ET. These cytokines include IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, PDGF, IFNs and TGF-β, all of which should be more closely investigated in MPN. Based on our extensive literature search, several key factors have emerged in our understanding of MPN: first, TNF-α could correlate with MPN progression including PMF, PV and ET. IL-1β plays a role in PMF progression, while it showed no relation with PV or ET. Second, IL-8 could be a prognostic factor for PMF, and IL-6 could be important for MPN progression. Third, VEGF and PDGF play an indirect role in MPN development and their inhibitors could be effective. Fourth, different subtypes of IFNs could have different effects in MPN. Finally, TGF-β is closely linked to MF, although the data are inconsistent. Agents that have targeted these cytokines described above are already in clinical trials, and some of them have even been used to treat MPN patients. Taken together, it will be critical to continue to investigate the precise role of these cytokines in the pathogenesis and progression of MPN. © 2019},

abstract={Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of citrulline (Cit) supplementation on inflammatory markers and liver histopathology in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this clinical trial, fifty NAFLD patients were assigned to receive 2 g/day Cit or placebo for 3 months. Results: At the end of study, serum high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and activity of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) were reduced in Cit group significantly more than placebo group (P-value = 0.02 and < 0.01 respectively). Serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was reduced in Cit group significantly more than placebo after adjusting for levels of baseline (P-value < 0.001). Moreover, Cit supplementation decreased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and hepatic steatosis significantly (P = 0.04). Anthropometric measurements and hepatic enzymes did not change significantly in any group (P ≥ 0.05). In conclusion, our results showed that 12 weeks supplementation with 2 g/day Cit improved inflammatory markers in patients with NAFLD. Further studies with longer period of supplementation and different dosages of Cit are needed to be able to conclude. Trial registration IRCT201703194010N18 on 2017-10-13 © 2019 The Author(s).},

Thus, we meant to evaluate the effect of EPA and DHA, administered alone or combined, with the activation of browning markers in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT), and thermogenic markers in brown adipose tissue (BAT). C57BL/6 adult male mice received a control diet or a high-fructose diet (HFru) for eight weeks, but after the first three weeks, HFru was divided into new groups: HFru, HFru + EPA, HFru + DHA, and HFru-EPA + DHA. EPA and DHA diminished adipocyte hypertrophy, recovered markers of browning in sWAT and thermogenic factors in the BAT, and improved gene expressions linked with mitochondrial biogenesis and lipid metabolism. Importantly, EPA and DHA administrated alone showed stronger results than the combination of EPA + DHA. The results suggest that EPA and DHA might be useful as adjuvant strategies to treat metabolic-associated disorders. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This work describes the development of electrophoretic deposition method for the elaboration of a porous coating on a dense membrane in order to improve its oxygen permeation performance. The dense membrane material produced from La 0.5 Sr 0.5 Fe 0.7 Ga 0.3 O 3-δ perovskite is coated with La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Fe 0.8 Co 0.2 O 3-δ perovskite layer by electrophoretic deposition method in order to improve the kinetics of oxygen surface exchanges. Then, the oxygen flux through the La 0.5 Sr 0.5 Fe 0.7 Ga 0.3 O 3-δ dense membrane is largely impacted by La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Fe 0.8 Co 0.2 O 3-δ electrophoretic coating, from 0.5 to 2.6 10 −3 mol⋅m −2 ⋅s −1 without and with La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Fe 0.8 Co 0.2 O 3-δ coating after heating at 900 °C, respectively. Besides, a large impact of the thickness of the electrophoretic coating on the oxygen flux through the membranes is observed. The electrophoretic deposition has shown to be a powerful elaboration method of membrane to produce gaseous oxygen with high purity. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={In this article, we present experimental and numerical techniques to investigate the transfer, transport, and reaction of a chemical species in the vicinity of rising bubbles. In the experiment, single oxygen bubbles of diameter d b =0.55…0.85mm are released into a measurement cell filled with tap water. The oxygen dissolves and reacts with sulfite to sulfate. Laser-induced fluorescence is used to visualize the oxygen concentration in the bubble wake from which the global mass transfer coefficient can be calculated. The ruthenium-based fluorescent dye seems to be surface active, such that the rise velocity is reduced by up to 50% compared to the experiment without fluorescent dye and a recirculation zone forms in the bubble wake. To access the local mass transfer at the interface, we perform complementary numerical simulations. Since the fluorescence tracer is essential for the experimental method, the effect of surface contamination is also considered in the simulation. We employ several improvements in the experimental and numerical procedures which allow for a quantitative comparison (locally and globally). Rise velocity and mass transfer coefficient agree within a few percents between experiment, simulation and literature results. Because the fluorescence tracer is frequently used in mass transfer experiments, we discuss its potential surface activity. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Isobutyl isobutyrate (IBIBE) is a typical long-chain ester widely used as a solvent, additive, or raw material. To address problems such as acidic waste emission and tedious downstream separation in traditional synthesis routes, a reactive extraction process concept employing the ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ([BMIm][HSO 4 ]) as a dual catalyst and solvent is proposed. To develop such an intensified process, thermodynamic analysis of the reaction system is firstly performed. Liquid-liquid equilibria indicate that [BMIm][HSO 4 ] is a proper extractant that can not only remove the formed IBIBE from the esterification system via phase splitting but also keep the reactants in the IL phase, both facilitating the forward reaction and thus improving the conversion of the reactant and the purity of IBIBE. The kinetics of the esterification is then experimentally determined and fitted using the activity-based kinetic model, which suggests the good catalytic performance of [BMIm][HSO 4 ]. Combining the NRTL model and activity-based kinetic model, a reactive extraction process for IBIBE formation is developed and simulated. High purity of IBIBE (0.9799) and high conversion (0.9931) are obtained. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={We show that confined impinging jet mixers (CIJMs) improve lipid extraction from microalgae. CIJMs turbulently mix organic solvent into algae suspensions. Turbulent flow shrinks the Kolmogorov length between algae cells and organic solvent, accelerating lipid diffusion and increasing lipid yield. Lipid extraction from Synechococcus Elongatus, for example, into hexane obtains yields similar to the performance of Bligh and Dyer methods using stronger chloroform and methanol solvent cocktails but much faster. Lipid yield does not vary significantly with the concentration of algae feedstock in the tested algae concentration range, implying that algae culture may be used directly as feedstock to CIJMs without intervening dewatering steps. Algal biocrude obtained from CIJMs converts successfully into biodiesel, and cascades of CIJMs increase the net lipid production. CIJMs provide fast lipid extraction, suggesting compelling opportunities to use CIJMs for extraction generally. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Urban water and wastewater utilities are striving to improve their environmental and economic performances due to multiple challenges such as increasingly stringent quality criterion, aging infrastructure, constraining financial burden, growing urban population, climate challenges and dwindling resources. Growing needs of holistic assessments of urban water systems are required to identify systems-level cross-domain solutions. This study evaluated the life cycle environmental and economic impacts of urban water and wastewater systems with two utilities in Greater Cincinnati region as a case study. The scope of this study includes the entire urban water and wastewater systems starting from raw water acquisition for drinking water to wastewater treatment and discharge. The detailed process-based life cycle models were developed based on the datasets provided by local water and wastewater utilities. The life cycle assessment indicated that the operation and maintenance of drinking water distribution was a dominating contributor for energy consumption (43%) and global warming potential (41%). Wastewater discharge from the wastewater treatment plant contributed to more than 80% of the total eutrophication potential. The cost analysis determined that labor and maintenance cost (19%) for wastewater collection, and electricity cost (13%) for drinking water distribution were major contributors. Electricity purchased by the utility was the driver for the majority of impact categories assessed with the exception of eutrophication, blue water use, and metal depletion. Infrastructure requirements had a negligible influence on impact results, contributing less than 3% to most categories, with the exception of metal depletion where it led to 68% of total burdens. Sensitivity analysis showed that the life cycle environmental results were more sensitive to the choice of the electricity mixes and electricity consumption than the rest of input parameters such as chemical dosages, and infrastructure life time. This is one of the first comprehensive studies of the whole urban water system using real case data. It elucidates a bigger picture of energy, resource and cost distributions in a typical urban centralized water system. Inherent to a modern city as large population centers, a significant expenditure has to be invested to provide water services function (moving water, treating water/wastewater) in order to avoid human and environmental health problems. This study provides insights for optimization potentials of overall treatment efficiency and can serve as a benchmark for communities considering adoption of alternative water systems. © 2018},

abstract={A 3-stage process, consisting of a combination of crystallization, milling, and dissolution stages for the selective manipulation of the size and shape of crystals, is investigated to characterize its performance when applied to different substances. To this aim, simulations are used to screen, via a parametric analysis, the effect of different compound properties and operating conditions on the size and shape of the final products. Through this analysis, characteristic trends of general validity are identified, thus allowing to define families of compounds with similar behavior and features. Based on these results, a set consisting of a small number of experiments is devised to fully characterize the outcome of the 3-stage process for a specific substance. An experimental validation is carried out by performing this set of experiments with two compounds, namely β L-Glutamic acid and γ D-Mannitol, thus assessing the suitability of this method for a comprehensive characterization of the process and its outcome. The information collected at the end of the different stages throughout all the experiments is further exploited to estimate the growth rates of γ D-Mannitol, in order to validate the observations made through simulations regarding the effect of growth kinetics on the process outcome. Finally, the model, fitted to the experimental evidence collected, has been used to further investigate and characterize the design space. © 2018},

abstract={Flow cytomtery (FCM) has become a standard approach to enumerate viruses in water research. However, the nature of the fluorescent signal in flow cytometric analysis of water samples and the mechanism of its formation, have not been addressed for bacteriophages expected in wastewaters. Here we assess the behaviour of fluorescent DNA-staining dyes in aqueous solutions, as well as sensitivity and accuracy of FCM for enumeration of DNA-stained model bacteriophages λ P1, and T4. We demonstrate that in aqueous systems fluorescent dyes form a self-stabilized (pseudolyophilic) emulsion of auto-fluorescing colloid particles. Sample shaking and addition of surfactants enhance auto-fluorescence due to increased dispersion and, in the presence of surfactants, stabilization of the dye emulsion. Bacteriophages with genome sizes <100 kbp (i.e. λ & P1) did not generate a distinct population signal to be detected by one of the most sensitive FCM instruments available (BD LSR Fortessa™ X-20), whereas the larger T4 bacteriophage was resolved as a distinct population of events. These results indicate that the use of fluorescent dyes for bacteriophage enumeration by flow cytometry can produce false positive signals and lead to wrong estimation of total virus counts by misreporting colloid particles as virions, depending on instrument sensitivity. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Introduction: Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder, characterized by the overproduction of myeloid cells in all stages of maturation. It is usually defined by three sequential stages (Chronic, Accelerated and Blast-crisis) where the transition from chronic to accelerated to blast phases is presumed to occur due to secondary genetic changes, viz. accumulation of mutations, activation of downstream pathways and failure of apoptosis. Caspase 9 is the initiator caspase involved in mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway. Polymorphisms in the promoter (−1263 A>G, -712C>T, -293 del) and coding (Ex5 +32G>A) regions of CASP9 gene are found to influence the expression levels by either impairing the activation or loss of expression of CASP9 or insufficient formation of apoptosome. Methods: The present case-control study was carried out on 999 individuals, comprised of 485CML cases reported at Nizams Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS), Hyderabad and 514 age and gender-matched healthy individuals from local population. DNA was isolated by non-enzymatic/salting-out method and was genotyped using RFLP technique. Results: It was observed that the presence of G allele of CASP9 -1263A>G polymorphism enhanced the risk for CML while CASP9 -712C>T and CASP9 -293del SNPs conferred protection against development of CML. Haplotype analysis of promoter and exonic polymorphisms had revealed increased risk associated with two haplotypes G_C_del (+)_G (OR-1.61, 95% CI-0.97-2.65, p-0.06#) and G_C_del (–)_G (OR-2.09, 95% CI-0.94-4.66, p-0.07#) suggesting the role of G allele of CASP9 -1263A>G in conferring risk independent of other SNPs. Pairwise LD analysis performed for all the four SNPs revealed the presence of LD among the SNPs. Conclusion: The results of the present study therefore concludes the role of CASP9 -1263A>G polymorphism in increasing the risk for the development and progression while CASP9 -712C>T and CASP9 -293del SNPs conferred protection and CASP9 Ex5 +32G>A was involved in conferring resistance which could be in combination with other SNPs or factors affecting them. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={Samples from the secondary clarifier effluent of a waste water treatment plant (serving 98500 inhabitants) were analyzed to determine the microplastics (MP) emission. The samples were collected using a stainless steel centrifugal pump and filtered through a 10 μm stainless steel cartridge filter. Microplastics particles (MPPs) and microplastics fibers (MPFs) were recovered by chemical and physical sample purification. To remove natural organic matter, the samples were first subjected to oxidative treatment with H2O2 and NaClO. Inorganic materials were subsequently removed by density separation in ZnCl2 (ρ = 1.9 g/cm3) using a centrifuge. Special centrifuge tubes were developed for this purpose. Sample analysis was performed on a Si filter by Raman micro-spectroscopy. Particles with a diameter (dp) ≥ 10 μm were analyzed. The results were differentiated by dry and wet weather samples. On average, 5900 MPPs m−3 were identified in the effluent on wet weather days compared to 3000 MPPs m−3 on dry weather days. Most of the MPPs detected were in the 30 μm &lt; dp &lt; 100 μm size range. The MPFs ranged between 100 μm and 1000 μm in length. While most of the MPFs were of PET origin, the MPPs consisted mainly of PET, PP, PE and PS. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Culture-based methods to measure Escherichia coli (E. coli) are used by beach administrators to inform whether bacteria levels represent an elevated risk to swimmers. Since results take up to 12 h, statistical models are used to forecast bacteria levels in lieu of test results; however they underestimate days with elevated fecal indicator bacteria levels. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) tests return results within 3 h but are 2–5 times more expensive than culture-based methods. This paper presents a prediction model which uses limited deployments of qPCR tested sites with inter-beach correlation to predict when bacteria will exceed acceptable thresholds. The model can be used to inform management decisions on when to warn residents or close beaches due to exposure to the bacteria. Using data from Chicago collected between 2006 and 2016, the model proposed in this paper increased sensitivity from 3.4 percent to 11.2 percent–a 230 percent increase. We find that the correlation between beaches are substantial enough to provide higher levels of precision and sensitivity to predictive models. Thus, limited deployments of qPCR testing can be used to deliver better predictions for beach administrators at lower cost and less complexity. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={Despite the substantial simplicities inherent in pseudo-continuum models of fixed bed reactors, there is a continued interest in the use of such models for predicting fluid flow and transport scalars. In this paper, we aim to quantitatively address the inadequacy of 2D pseudo-continuum models for narrow-tube fixed beds. We show this by comparing with spatially resolved 3D results obtained by a robust and integrated numerical workflow, consisting of a sequential Rigid Body Dynamics and Computational Fluid Dynamics (RBD-CFD) approach. The RBD is founded on a physics-based hard-body packing algorithm, recently proposed by the authors (Moghaddam, E.M., Foumeny, E.A., Stankiewicz, A.I., Padding, J.T., 2018. A Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithm for Modelling Random Packing Structures of Non-Spherical and Non-Convex Pellets. Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 57, 14988–15007), which offers a rigorous method to handle resting contacts between particles. The methodology is benchmarked for simulations of flow fields in all flow regimes, for 5 ≤ Re p ≤ 3,000, in random packings of spheres and cylinders with tube-to-pellet diameter ratios, N, between 2.29 and 6.1. The CFD results reveal a remarkable influence of local structure on the velocity distribution at the pellet scale, particularly in low-N packings, where the spatial heterogeneity of the structure is very strong along the bed axis. It is also demonstrated that azimuthal averaging of the 3D velocity field over the bed volume, which has been considered as an advancement over plug flow idealization in classical pseudo-continuum models, cannot reflect the role of vortex regions emerging in the wake of the pellets, and leads to underestimation of the local velocity values by more than 400% of the inlet velocity. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={We summarize the effects of bergamot (extract, juice, essential oil, and polyphenolic fraction) on cardiovascular, bone, inflammatory, skin diseases, mood alteration, anxiety, pain, and stress. This review included a total of 31 studies (20 studies on humans with 1709 subjects and 11 in animals (rats and mice)). In humans, bergamot-derived extract (BE) exerts positive effects on hyperlipidemia with an oral dose from 150 mg to 1000 mg/day of flavonoids administered from 30 to 180 days, demonstrating an effect on body weight and in modulating total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and HDL. Studies in animals confirm promising data on glucose control (500/1000 mg/day of BE with a treatment lasting 30 days) are available in rats. In animals models, bergamot essential oil (BEO, 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg daily for 20 weeks) increases bone volume, decreases psoriatic plaques, increases skin collagen content, and promotes hair growth. Bergamot juice (20 mg/kg) is promising in terms of pro-inflammatory cytokine reduction. In humans, aromatherapy (from 15 to 30 min) does not appear to be useful in order to reduce stress, anxiety, and nausea, compared to placebo. Compared to baseline, BE topical application and BEO aromatherapy reduce blood diastolic and systolic pressure and could have a significant effect on improving mental conditions. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Innovative solutions are necessary to enable the decentralized recycling of greywater for applications requiring high-quality water, such as hand washing. While physical barriers such as ultrafiltration membranes effectively prevent the passage of bacteria, and chemical and biological treatments can effectively reduce the carbon content of the treated water, there exists a knowledge gap regarding the application of anti-bacterial strategies to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria following treatment. In this study, the effluent water from a household-scale greywater treatment system was fed to seven parallel experimental post-treatment tanks: three receiving direct chlorination with free chlorine residuals of 0.2, 1 or 5 mg Cl2/L, three with chlorine produced through electrolysis at the same residual concentrations, and one control with no chlorine added. For increasing concentrations of direct chlorination, the median total cell count (TCC) values were 9 × 104, 2.9 × 104 and 1.8 × 103 cells/mL, respectively. Electrolysis treatment produced very similar TCC concentrations, 8.8 × 104, 1.1 × 104 and 2.3 × 103 cells/mL. The TCC concentrations were lower than the concentration of the water entering each tank (∼3 × 105 cells/mL). Intact cell count (ICC) measurements indicated that the viable cell concentrations, were less than 10% of the TCC values. Though electrolysis treatment can produce powerful oxidants, such as hydroxyl radical, there was no evidence that electrolysis in this system provided additional benefits beyond chlorine production for control of total or intact cell counts. Oxidation of bacteria by chlorine was the dominant anti-bacterial mechanism in our system. Monitoring of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and assimilable organic carbon (AOC) did not suggest that carbon-limitation significantly impacted cell counts when chlorination or electrolysis treatment was applied. This work demonstrates that either direct chlorination or electrolysis treatment are able to reduce bacteria concentrations over long-term operation of a hand washing water treatment system. We recommend selecting chlorine residual targets such that a chlorine residual is maintained during periods of challenging operating conditions. We observed that a target residual of 1 mg Cl2/L, in our system, maintained the TCC below the concentration found in Zürich drinking water. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={With increasing populations, mounting environmental pressures and aging infrastructure, urban water and wastewater utilities have to make investment decisions limited by both economic and environmental constraints. The challenges facing urban water systems can no longer be sustainably solved by traditional siloed water management approaches. A central premise of contemporary urban water management paradigms is that in order for urban water systems to be more sustainable and economical, an improvement in resource use efficiency at system level must be achieved. This study provides a quantification of the total resource use of a typical urban water system exemplified in Greater Cincinnati region from raw water extraction for drinking water to wastewater treatment and discharge, providing a better understanding of resource expenditure distributions within the system and a necessary benchmark to which future system improvements can be compared. The emergy methodology was used so that the total environmental work required to produce disparate system inputs could be expressed using a common unit. The results were compared to the concurring life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) results of the same system. Emergy results highlight drinking water treatment and drinking water distribution as two resource-intensive stages, with energy for pumping and chemicals for conditioning representing the greatest inputs to the former and energy for pumping and metals for piping representing the greatest inputs to the latter. For wastewater collection and treatment stages, aeration and sludge handling were identified as the highest emergy unit processes, mostly due to energy use. Comparison with LCA results substantiate the environmental concerns associated with energy use in the drinking water treatment and distribution stages but indicate that environmental burdens associated with infrastructure are more dependent upon upstream resource use rather than downstream environmental impact. Results from emergy, LCA and LCC point towards aeration and sludge handling as two unit processes on the wastewater side that are particularly costly and environmentally impactful. Results in total are used to suggest alternative strategies that can alleviate identified environmental burdens and economic costs. © 2018},

abstract={Exopolysaccharides (EPSs) are high-molecular-weight carbohydrates with a wide range of biophysiological activities, such as antioxidant activity, immunostimulatory activity, antitumor activity, hepatoprotective activity, and antifatigue effects. In the present work, two water-soluble EPSs, namely, A14EPS-1 and A14EPS-2, were isolated and purified from the fungal endophytic strain A14 using ethanol precipitation, DEAE-cellulose ion exchange chromatography and Sepharose G-150 gel filtration chromatography. A14EPS-1 (∼2.4 × 10 4 Da, the major fraction) was mainly composed of mannose, rhamnose, glucose, galactose, xylose and arabinose with a molar ratio of 0.31:0.55:10.00:0.34:0.03:0.06. The major monosaccharide of A14EPS-1 was pyranose, which was connected by α-glycosidic linkages. And the side chains of A14EPS-1 may be composed of rhamnose, arabinose, glucose and galactose; moreover, the backbone of A14EPS-1 may be composed of rhamnose, xylose, arabinose and glucose. A14EPS-2 (∼0.5 × 10 4 Da) was mainly composed of mannose, rhamnose, glucose, galactose, xylose and arabinose in a ratio of 0.16:0.88:10.00:0.39:0.06:0.06. Pyranose was observed in both the α- and β-configurations in A14EPS-2, and the α configuration was dominant. In addition, the results of the bioactivity assays indicated that both A14EPS-1 and A14EPS-2 had moderate antioxidant activity in vitro, and A14EPS-2 showed a moderate antiproliferation effect on human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. © 2018 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan},

abstract={Here we report for the first time the Y27-STR Yfiler plus profiles of the insular population of Cebú in the central region of the Philippine Archipelago and the general continental population of Thailand, two strategic locations of interest in connection with the Austronesian expansion. Traditionally, the peopling of Taiwan has been envisioned as a single wave of agriculturists migrating from mainland Southeast Asia. Yet, more recent data support a scenario in which a number of migrations from the continent populated the island. Genetic affinity parameters from this study indicate that certain Formosan tribes are genetically closer to geographical distant populations in the Solomon Island than to other nearby Taiwanese tribes. Furthermore, Taiwanese aboriginal populations in this study partition into three clusters, one associated with populations from the Philippines and Thailand, a second one segregating with populations of the Solomon Islands and a third grouping made up exclusively of Taiwanese aboriginal tribes. The populations within each of these three clusters exhibit different degrees of differentiation among them suggesting unique population histories. All together, these differential genetic affinities of specific Taiwanese tribes to groups from different geographical regions and to each other are compatible with multiple origins of the Austronesian expansion from Formosa as well as from mainland Southeast Asia. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={Objectives: To investigate whether endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) T786C, 4VNTR and G894 T gene polymorphisms could mediate in andrological treatment response in Spaniards. Subject patients/methods: The study participants were Spaniard males with erectile dysfunction (ED) and chronic pain (n = 105) recruited at the Pain Unit. eNOS polymorphisms were genotyped by quantitative polymerase chain reaction using Taqman specific probes. Statistical analyses were carried out using R-3.2.4 software. Results: A total of 69 patients required andrological treatment and 76% of them improved ED upon iPED5 (20%), testosterone (35%) or iPDE5/testosterone treatment (45%); being significantly better in T786C-CC patients. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that age, opioid daily dose and carriage of T786C-C allele influenced the risk and ED severity in Spaniard chronic pain patients. Conclusion: T786C polymorphism at eNOS locus appeared to be a major contributor in the variable erectile function iPDE5/testosterone response in Spaniards. © 2019},

abstract={Rural households in developing countries rely on communal water supplies and household water frequently becomes contaminated following its collection, transportation and during its storage. Using culture-dependent and -independent techniques, we examined the changes in microbial water quality between communal tap water and household water storage in a rural area of Cameroon, Africa. The culturable fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) were used to assess the potential health risks associated with different household water storage conditions (e.g., type of container and open vs. closed container) and interventions (e.g., water storage days, cleaned on the last day of use, and hygiene practices). Only the amount of days the water was stored significantly differed (p-value < 0.05), which showed that potential health risks increased when water was stored for more than 3 days. The higher abundance of molecular FIB in biofilm than household water suggested that omnipresent biofilm in household water could potential health risk. The high-throughput sequencing revealed that the most abundant phylum was Proteobacteria, followed by Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes in both the water and the biofilm samples. Bacterial genera seen in biofilm bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and Comamonas. Acinetobacter, Chryseobacterium, Stenotrophomonas and Corynebacterium, were relatively more abundant in the biofilm than in the water. Potential bacterial pathogens including Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter freundii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Haemophilus influenza, were detected in household water and biofilm. The microbial quality might be affected by water-storage time and households repeatedly using the same water storage containers without proper sanitization, triggering microbial regrowth and biofilm formation on water containers. Higher bacterial diversity and potentially pathogenic bacteria found in the biofilm samples of a household water supply are unhealthy for the house's inhabitants. It is important to develop interventions aimed at preventing the formation of these dangerous biofilms in a communal water supply. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Lem2 family proteins, i.e. the LAP2-Emerin-MAN1 (LEM) domain-containing nuclear envelope proteins, are well-conserved from yeasts to humans, both of which belong to the Opisthokonta supergroup. However, whether their homologs are present in other eukaryotic phylogenies remains unclear. In this study, we identified two Lem2 homolog proteins, which we named as Lem2 and MicLem2, in a ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila belonging to the SAR supergroup. Lem2 was localized to the nuclear envelope of the macronucleus (MAC) and micronucleus (MIC), while MicLem2 was exclusively localized to the nuclear envelope of the MIC. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that Lem2 in T. thermophila was localized to both the inner and outer nuclear envelopes of the MAC and MIC, while MicLem2 was mostly localized to the nuclear pores of the MIC. Molecular domain analysis using GFP-fused protein showed that the N-terminal and luminal domains, including the transmembrane segments, are responsible for nuclear envelope localization. During sexual reproduction, enrichment of Lem2 occurred in the nuclear envelopes of the MAC and MIC to be degraded, while MicLem2 was enriched in the nuclear envelope of the MIC that escaped degradation. These findings suggest the unique characteristics of Tetrahymena Lem2 proteins. Our findings provide insight into the evolutionary divergence of nuclear envelope proteins. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={This study presents a new gel based technique to describe the pore water ammonium distribution through the sediment-water interface in two dimensions at a millimeter scale. The technique is an adaptation of the classical colorimetric method based on the Berthelot's reaction. After the thin film of the gel probe was equilibrated by diffusion either in standard solutions or in pore waters, a colorimetric reagent gel was set on the gel probe, allowing development of the characteristic green color. A flatbed scanner and subsequent densitometry image analysis allowed to determine the concentration distribution of ammonium. The gel probe was tested in the laboratory for two media, deionized water and seawater, within the range 0–3000 μM in NH4+. Detection limit is about 20 μM and accuracy about ±25 μM. The field validation was realized in a tidal mudflat of the French Atlantic coast by comparison with conventional pore water extraction and colorimetric analysis. The large range of concentrations and its applicability in continental and marine sediments suggest a wide range of applications of the technique for a reasonable cost. © 2018},

abstract={Reverse-Transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) provides a valuable tool to study gene expression with exquisite sensitivity. To retain its inferential power, user-introduced technical variability must be reduced and accounted for. Selecting a set of stably expressed internal control genes (ICG), validated for each experimental condition/sample set, is widely accepted as a reliable way to normalize RT-qPCR data and account for said variability. Despite significant efforts in establishing standardized and resource-efficient normalization approaches, numerous recent reports have underlined deficiencies in the state of RT-qPCR normalization. Livestock science has benefitted tremendously from the use of RT-qPCR; however, the issue of lack of proper normalization likely affects this discipline as well. We thus decided to determine whether this is true, and to which extent. We conducted an in-depth analysis of all (225) RT-qPCR articles published in the six most prominent livestock journals in the field from 2013 to 2017. A quantitative scale was constructed, and values were assigned to each article based on the number of ICG used, the use of a publicly available algorithm to assess the reliability of ICG, and the reporting of pertinent information related to ICG (ranges from 0 = total noncompliance - to 100 = total compliance). Out of the surveyed group, only 10.7% of the publications obtained a score of 100, while the largest group (n = 158) was represented by articles that scored 0. Subdividing articles based on whether an algorithm to validate ICG was used (YAL) or not (NAL) revealed the use of a larger number of ICG to normalize RT-qPCR in the YAL group compared to NAL (1.4-fold more, 95% C.I.: 1.11–1.84) and was closer to the “gold standard” of three ICG. Using an algorithm also increased the diversity of ICG and significantly reduced the use of RNA18S, whose suitability as ICG has been thoroughly debated. These remarkably low normalization standards are likely to generate questionable results that can severely hinder the advance of transcriptomic studies in livestock science and related fields. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={Background: Avian avulavirus-1 (AAvV-1, previously Newcastle Disease Virus) is responsible for poultry and wild birds' disease outbreaks. Numerous whole genome sequencing methods were reported for this virus. These methods included cloning, specific primers amplification, shotgun PCR approaches, Sequence Independent Single Primer Amplification and next generation sequencing platform kits. Methods: Three methods were used to sequence 173 Israeli Avian avulavirus-1 field isolates and one vaccine strain (VH). The sequencing was performed on Proton and Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine and to a lesser extent, Illumina MiSeq and NextSeq sequencers. Target specific primers (SP) and Sequence Independent Single Primer Amplification (SISPA) products sequenced via the Ion torrent sequencer had a high error rate and truncated genomes. All the next generation sequencing platform sequencing kits generated high sequence accuracy and near-complete genomic size. Results: A high level of mutations was observed in the intergenic regions between the avian avulavirus-1 genes. Within genes, multiple regions are more mutated than the Fusion region currently used for typing. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the whole genome sequencing by the Ion torrent sequencing kit is sufficient. However, when higher fidelity is desired, the Illumina NextSeq and Proton torrent sequencing kits were found to be preferable. © 2019},

abstract={Microalgal and cyanobacterial resource recovery systems could significantly advance nutrient recovery from wastewater by achieving effluent nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) levels below the current limit of technology. The successful implementation of phytoplankton, however, requires the formulation of process models that balance fidelity and simplicity to accurately simulate dynamic performance in response to environmental conditions. This work synthesizes the range of model structures that have been leveraged for algae and cyanobacteria modeling and core model features that are required to enable reliable process modeling in the context of water resource recovery facilities. Results from an extensive literature review of over 300 published phytoplankton models are presented, with particular attention to similarities with and differences from existing strategies to model chemotrophic wastewater treatment processes (e.g., via the Activated Sludge Models, ASMs). Building on published process models, the core requirements of a model structure for algal and cyanobacterial processes are presented, including detailed recommendations for the prediction of growth (under phototrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic conditions), nutrient uptake, carbon uptake and storage, and respiration. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={The full configuration interaction (full-CI) method is capable of providing the numerically best wave functions and energies of atoms and molecules within basis sets being used, although it is intractable for classical computers. Quantum computers can perform full-CI calculations in polynomial time against the system size by adopting a quantum phase estimation algorithm (QPEA). In the QPEA, the preparation of initial guess wave functions having sufficiently large overlap with the exact wave function is recommended. The Hartree-Fock (HF) wave function is a good initial guess only for closed shell singlet molecules and high-spin molecules carrying no spin-β unpaired electrons, around their equilibrium geometry, and thus, the construction of multiconfigurational wave functions without performing post-HF calculations on classical computers is highly desired for applying the method to a wide variety of chemistries and physics. In this work, we propose a method to construct multiconfigurational initial guess wave functions suitable for QPEA-based full-CI calculations on quantum computers, by utilizing diradical characters computed from spin-projected UHF wave functions. The proposed approach drastically improves the wave function overlap, particularly in molecules with intermediate diradical characters. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

The data is based on the series of 37 years of the Finnish Ice Service’s ice charts for navigational purposes. The earlier ice charts from the winters 1980/1981 to 2005/2006 were first digitized for the statistical analysis. The later ice charts from the winters 2006/2007 to 2016/2017 were already available in digital form. From these charts, parameters such as ice thickness, ice type, concentration and degree of ridging were analyzed to achieve design parameters for the offshore wind turbine design.

abstract={The recent regulation concerning the ban of the hydro-fluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants has led to the employment of environmentally friendly solutions for refrigeration. Systems that employ CO2 seem to be a viable option which is compatible with the current legislation. The objective of the present work is the investigation of ten different refrigeration systems with CO2 and to compare them with a conventional system with R404A in energetic terms. The analysis is conducted on an annual basis by using the measured energy consumptions and loads for an existing system with R404A. Except for the refrigeration system comparison, a model for the prediction of the hourly refrigeration loads of the existing supermarket is developed using experimental results. This model is applied for the yearly evaluation of the proposed CO2 refrigeration systems. The examined CO2 system configurations include a simple booster system, a system with parallel compression, a system with parallel compression and overfed evaporators in the medium temperature, a system with parallel compression and overfed evaporators in both medium and low temperature, a system similar to the last one with the addition of an intercooler after the low temperature compressors, and all the aforementioned systems with the addition of a mechanical subcooling cycle after the gas cooler. According to the final results, the most promising configuration is the one with parallel compression, overfed evaporators in medium and low temperature, intercooler and mechanical subcooling, which leads to 8.53% yearly electricity savings compared to the conventional R404A system. Moreover, it is important to state that the simple booster CO2 system is found to be less efficient than the conventional R404A system with 15.23% higher yearly electricity consumption. © 2019},

abstract={Oxide glasses are one of the most important engineering and functional material families owing to their unique features, such as tailorable physical properties. However, at the same time intrinsic brittleness has been their main drawback, which severely restricts many applications. Despite much progress, a breakthrough in developing ultra-damage-resistant and ductile oxide glasses still needs to be made. Here, a critical advancement toward such oxide glasses is presented. In detail, a bulk oxide glass with a record-high crack resistance is obtained by subjecting a caesium aluminoborate glass to surface aging under humid conditions, enabling it to sustain sharp contact deformations under loads of ≈500 N without forming any strength-limiting cracks. This ultra-high crack resistance exceeds that of the annealed oxide glasses by more than one order of magnitude, making this glass micro-ductile. In addition, a remarkable indentation behavior, i.e., a time-dependent shrinkage of the indent cavity, is demonstrated. Based on structural analyses, a molecular-scale deformation model to account for both the ultra-high crack resistance and the time-dependent shrinkage in the studied glass is proposed. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Background: Lipomatous meningiomas are a rare variety of meningioma, in which fat storage occurs in adipocytes and lipoblasts are found within the tumor. World Health Organization grade II atypical meningiomas with lipometaplasia and extensive hyperostosis of calvarium is a rare type with a good prognosis after complete removal. Case Description: Here we report a case of intracranial atypical meningioma with lipometaplasia and disproportionately large hyperostosis of overlying calvarium in a 40-year-old man. His computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans showed right frontotemporoparietal homogenous bony swelling with an underlying diffusely enhancing extra-axial, dural-based lesion with areas of hyperintensity on T1 and isointensity on T2 with perilesional edema. Microscopically, it revealed a meningeal neoplasm with hypercellularity, small cell changes, sheathing pattern, and extensive lipomatous metaplasia. Conclusions: World Health Organization grade II atypical meningiomas with lipometaplasia and extensive hyperostosis of calvarium is a rare type with a good prognosis after complete removal. Clinical features in patients are similar to those of conventional meningioma; however, radiologic features depend on the amount of fat present in the tumor. To the best of our knowledge, there are no case reports in the current literature regarding this. Every new case will widen our horizon.

abstract={Objective: Sino-implant (II) is a contraceptive implant approved for 4 years of use in China. We evaluated the contraceptive efficacy during the third, fourth and fifth year, and assessed additional pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and acceptability endpoints. Study design: We enrolled a cohort of 255 current Sino-Implant (II) users entering their third year and a second cohort of 243 users entering their fourth year. We followed these two cohorts for 12 and 24 months, respectively. To characterize PK endpoints (i.e. levonorgestrel (LNG), sex hormone binding globulin and free LNG index) over 5 years, we collected blood samples in a subset of 50 participants we followed during the third, fourth and fifth year. We also enrolled small cohorts (n = 20) of Sino-implant (II) users entering their sixth month and second year and followed them each for up to 6 months. Our primary efficacy measures were the pregnancy Pearl Indices during Year 3 and 4. Secondary objectives included assessments of PK, safety, acceptability and efficacy in the fifth year. Results: We recorded four pregnancies, with a higher pregnancy rate during Year 3 [1.34 (95% CI: 0.28–3.93)] than Year 4 [0.44 (95% CI: 0.01–2.47)] or Year 5 [0.00 (95% CI: 0.00–2.02)]. The overall pregnancy rate for the third, fourth and fifth years of product use was 0.63 per 100 WY; 95% CI: (0.17–1.62). Mean LNG concentrations remained well above 200 pg/mL (Year 3 = 280.9; Year 4 = 233.6; Year 5 = 270.6). Most participants (93.7%) described their bleeding pattern as acceptable. Conclusion: Sino-implant (II) is a highly effective contraceptive method in this population of Chinese women over 5 years. Implications: Sino-implant (II) is a highly effective contraceptive method with an estimated Pearl Index of less than 1% over the third, fourth and fifth years of use in a population of Chinese women of reproductive age. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The rotational spectra of the –OH and –OD isotopologues of 3,5-difluorobenzyl alcohol have been measured by pulsed jet Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. The main structural evidence is that the OCα-C1C2 dihedral angle, approximately 20° is ca. 40° smaller than in benzyl alcohol. This difference is reflected in the features of the rotational spectrum: μc-type (instead of μb-) transitions are split into two evenly spaced component lines (by 14.367(1) × 2 MHz) showing that the CH2OH group undergoes a tunnelling motion which connects two equivalent minima above and below the aromatic ring. The barrier for the interconversion of the two mirror form has been estimated from the experimental tunnelling splitting to be 380 cm−1. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={An innovative solution for groundwater velocity measurement in wells, the Direct Velocity Tool (DVT), is developed and tested. The DVT allows measurement of Darcy flux at centimeter scale vertical resolution requiring only a few minutes for each measurement (typically 5–10 min). Results are generated in real time through the use of an equation. The theoretical functional Darcy flux range is between 1 and 40 cm.day−1 for an aquifer with a hydraulic conductivity, K, less than 10−3 m.s−1. Laboratory tests showed a linear response between Darcy flux imposed and Darcy flux measured with the DVT, with a high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.99). The DVT was tested for velocities ranging from 5 to 30 cm.day−1 where a higher standard deviation was observed for higher velocity (±6.46 cm.day−1 for 30 cm.day−1). At a hydraulically controlled field site, tracer tests, borehole dilutions, Passive Flux Meter (PFM) and DVT were tested under constant flow conditions. The PFM, tracer test and DVT technologies measured similar Darcy flux ranging from 10 to 17 cm.day−1. The DVT and PFM had uncertainties of 2.70 cm.day−1 and 2.50 cm.day−1, respectively. At a contaminated field site, velocities measured with the PFM range between 5 and 9 cm.day−1, while the DVT provided velocities of 4 to 8 cm.day−1. Velocity measurement showed similar results at the contaminated field site between PFM and DVT. The DVT offers an innovative solution for Darcy flux measurement and can be deployed easily. It provides the capability to characterize the vertical distribution of the horizontal velocity for a well in a period of 1–2 h. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={Objective: Sino-implant (II) is a contraceptive implant that had a commodity price one-third of the competing products a decade ago. To make Sino-implant (II) more widely available, we conducted a trial to collect safety and efficacy data required for World Health Organization (WHO) prequalification, a quality standard allowing global donors to procure a pharmaceutical product. Study design: This was a randomized controlled trial allocating 650 participants to either Sino-implant (II) or Jadelle®. Participants were seen at 1 and 6 months, and then semiannually. The primary efficacy measure was the pregnancy Pearl Index [number of pregnancies per 100 women-years (WY) of follow-up] in the Sino-implant (II) group during up to 4 years of implant use. Results: For the primary outcome, Sino-implant (II) had a 4-year Pearl Index of 0.74 (95% confidence interval, 0.36–1.37) compared to 0.00 (95% confidence interval, 0.00–1.04) for Jadelle®. The Sino-implant (II) pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the fourth year (3.54 per 100 WY) than in the first 3 years combined (0.18 per 100 WY; p <.001). Total levonorgestrel concentrations were equivalent between groups at month 12, but were 19%, 22% and 32% lower in the Sino-implant (II) group at months 24, 36 and 48, respectively (p <.001 at each time point). Safety and acceptability of the two products were similar, while providers documented significantly higher breakage rates during removal of Sino-implant (II) (16.3% vs. 3.1%; p <.001). Conclusion: Based on these results, WHO prequalified Sino-Implant (II) with a 3-year use label in June 2017, 2 years shorter than the 5-year duration of Jadelle®. Implications: WHO prequalification allows global donors to procure Sino-implant (II), which means women in many low resource countries will have greater access to highly effective and acceptable contraceptive implants. Our study noted important clinical differences, including shorter duration of high effectiveness with Sino-implant (II) when compared to the other available two-rod system, Jadelle®. Introduction strategies should include appropriate training on these differences. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Atmospheric chemistry studies are frequently conducted in flow reactors, such as the potential aerosol mass (PAM) reactor. To characterize the flow condition in such a reactor, an axially-dispersed plug flow reactor (AD-PFR) model has been applied to explain the observed residence time distribution (RTD). Compared with the traditional RTD analysis that directly fits the observed data from a pulse input or differentiates the data points from a step input, we introduce here a direct method to retrieve the axial diffusivity in an AD-PFR model by fitting an analytical formula to the rising profile of the tracer at the beginning of the experiment (the transition data before the reactor reaches steady state). This method can be readily used to determine the flow conditions inside an AD-PFR. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={The direct emission of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from road vehicle exhaust has been an important contributor to near-road ambient concentrations of NO2 in many European cities. Diesel vehicles and their use of emission control technologies such as Diesel Oxidation Catalysts, have dominated the emission of NO2 from road vehicles. In this work, we summarise findings from recent vehicle emission remote sensing measurements in the UK that provide detailed information on the emissions of NO2 and total NOx(NO2 + NO). We show that while new diesel cars and light commercial vehicles are associated with high (typically 30%) proportions of NO2/NOx, the amount of absolute NOx and NO2 emitted by most Euro 6 vehicles has decreased substantially and that absolute emissions of NO2 have been reducing since around 2007. Additionally, we find that the amount of NO2 decreases as the vehicle mileage increases. Taken together, these factors have led to substantial reductions in emissions of NO2 in recent years from light duty diesel vehicles, which has contributed to reduced roadside NO2 concentrations. There is a need however for commonly used emission factor models to account for these changes in emissions of NO2. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={In this investigation, application of linear solvent energy relationships (LSERs) and principal component analysis (PCA) methods have been employed to investigate the structure-retention dependencies of E-resveratrol analogues separated under different stationary and mobile phase conditions. To this end, the retention of 22 analogues have been determined with phenyl, diol, bidentate anchored C18 (BDC18) and Diamond Hydride™ C18 (DHC18) substituted silica hydride stationary phases under isocratic chromatographic conditions using mobile phases containing 0.1 (% v/v) formic acid and different acetonitrile or methanol contents from 10 to 90% (v/v) in 10% increments. In general, these compounds showed decreasing retention with increased acetonitrile or methanol content in the mobile phase with all the stationary phases. The retention order generally followed their log P values, although some unique selectivity variations were apparent depending on the nature of the selected stationary and mobile phases. These 22 compounds contained different backbone functionalities linking the phenyl ring A to phenyl ring B and different numbers of hydroxyl groups in the phenyl ring A/phenyl ring B. Structure-retention descriptors, derived according to LSER concepts, were analysed by PCA methods to provide group classification of these resveratrol analogues from the associated PC1 versus PC2 score plots. These results revealed that the selectivity of these compounds was dominated by hydrophobic and steric interactions. Based on the number and position of hydroxyl groups in a specific resveratrol analogue, a reliable curve fitting approach (indicated by R2 &gt; 0.99 for the correlation between experimental and predicted log k values) was derived for prediction of the retention of these analytes under different mobile phase isocratic separation conditions. The application of similar methods are anticipated to find general utility for the analysis of diverse classes of other low molecular mass compounds in the different modes of liquid chromatography, permitting enhanced levels of prediction and evaluation of the retention attributes of polar and non-polar compounds. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Shallow groundwater extraction for irrigating park trees in the Taipei Basin is a sustainable solution for environmental resource management and urban landscape preservation because it reduces the potential for damage to the underground infrastructure caused by rising groundwater levels. This study identified appropriate locations with clean and stable groundwater for irrigating park trees in the metropolitan Taipei Basin according to variability conditions of water quality. First, six hydrochemical parameters of groundwater associated with the Taiwan irrigation water quality standard were collected from a 12-year Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration survey. The first, second, and third quartiles of the six hydrochemical parameters were obtained to establish three estimation thresholds. According to the irrigation water quality standard, multivariate indicator kriging (MVIK) was adopted to probabilistically evaluate the integration of the six hydrochemical parameters. Subsequently, entropy based on the MVIK estimates was applied to quantify the spatial and seasonal variability of the hydrochemical parameters. Finally, the locations with high estimated probabilities and low local uncertainties were identified as appropriate locations for extracting groundwater to irrigate park trees. The results revealed that MVIK and entropy can be combined to determine the variability conditions of groundwater quality parameters and identify parks suitable for extracting groundwater for irrigation. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Potency testing of tetanus antitoxin must be performed in vivo, in a very painful, stressful and prone to high variability assay. It is, therefore, mandatory to find alternatives to this kind of potency assessment. Immunochemical tests as ELISA or ToBI test are already available but usually results in a poor correlation to the in vivo protection. Considering research and development of mono and oligoclonal antibodies against tetanus and the improvement of equine polyclonal antitoxin production and control, we developed an alternative instrumental test for tetanus antitoxin by using surface plasmon resonance. Tetanus antitoxin from hyperimmune equine sera (16 batches) were tested and the results indicated excellent concordance and correlation to the in vivo test (Lin's ρ = 0.9). This innovative approach should now be improved in order to extend it to oligoclonal and monoclonal human antibodies aiming to replace mice for the potency assessment of tetanus antitoxin especially during research and development steps. © 2019 International Alliance for Biological Standardization},

The theoretical Ligand to Metal Charge Transfer (LMCT) energies were overestimated in the case of simple CI calculations. Therefore in order to overcome this problem we considered the configuration-dependent correction (CDC) and the effect of lattice relaxation based on the Shannon's crystal radii. As a result, the quantitative agreement between the theoretical LMCT energies and the experimental ones was greatly improved and the characteristic dependence of the LMCT energies on atomic species was also successfully reproduced without any experimental parameter. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={We examine arrays of metal-mesh frameworks for their wide-band absorption. These take the form of quasi-crystal optical cages. While there are many plasmonic structures that exhibit lossy behavior, they tend to be narrow band. By defining a quality loss metric, L = A/Q, where A is the absorption coefficient and Q is the quality factor, we are able to show that all absorbers fall in the range L:[0,2]. Metastructures have L∼0.04 while in our case L∼0.35. An array of cages tends to concentrate the incoming radiation within each framework. An array of cage-within-cage funnels the radiation from the outer cage to its inner core even further raising the possibility for new applications. We report on two surprising outcomes: copper based frameworks are better than silver based, and larger cage opening (thinner wires) are more effective than smaller openings (thicker wires). © 2019},

abstract={This paper presents the design of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) tri-generation system that consists of an SOFC-combined heat and power subsystem, an adsorption refrigeration subsystem, and coupling devices between the two subsystems. Whereas typical extant designs use absorption techniques, the proposed design employs adsorption refrigeration. In this paper, the dynamics of adsorption refrigeration are reported in detail to evaluate the feasibility of the tri-generation system design. The design of the coupling devices and instrumentation strategies of the overall system are discussed in detail. Simulation results indicate that the proposed SOFC tri-generation system can output 4.35 kW of electrical power, 2.448 kW of exhaust heat power, and 1.348 kW of cooling power. The energy efficiency is 64.9%, and the coefficient of performance of the refrigeration is 0.32. Varying the electrical output power results in the variation of exhaust heat power but not the cooling power; varying the cooling power affects the exhaust heat power but not the electrical power. These favorable features can be attributed to the proposed heat exchange sequence and active temperature controls of the system. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={The refrigeration systems with CO2 seem to be attractive choices for the design of refrigeration systems with small environmental impact. The objective of this work is the comparison of different transcritical CO2 refrigeration systems and the determination of the most promising configurations. A typical system (evaporator, compressor, gas cooler, expansion valve) is the reference system and it is compared with a system with internal heat exchanger, a parallel compression system, a two-stage compression system and a system with mechanical subcooling after the gas collector. The examined systems produce refrigeration at one temperature level and they are examined for various operation scenarios. More specifically, the refrigeration temperature is examined from −35 °C to +5 °C, while the condenser temperature (or the gas cooler outlet temperature) from 35 °C to 50 °C. The analysis is conducted with developed models in Engineering Equation Solver (EES). According to the results, all the examined systems are more efficient than the reference system for all the examined scenarios. The system with the mechanical subcooling and the two-stage compression system are found to be the most efficient choices with a mean coefficient of performance enhancement at 75.8% and 49.8% respectively. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={We study the Back and Forth Error Compensation and Correction (BFECC) method for linear hyperbolic systems and in particular for the Maxwell's equations. BFECC has been applied to schemes for scalar advection equations to improve their stability and order of accuracy. Similar results have been established in this paper for linear hyperbolic systems with constant coefficients. We apply BFECC to the central difference scheme, Lax-Friedrichs scheme and a combination of them for the Maxwell's equations and obtain second order accurate schemes with large CFL numbers (greater than 1 in one or two dimensions). The method is further applied to schemes on non-orthogonal unstructured grids. The new BFECC schemes for the Maxwell's equations operate on a single non-staggered grid and are simple to implement on unstructured grids. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new schemes. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Ultrafast-laser inscribed optical memories have been considered as a high-density low-energy-consumption alternative to the magnetization-based memories. The optical memories are based on laser-induced material modifications resulting in the refractive index change. The long-term stability of such modifications has been indicated by subjecting them to the accelerated aging by annealing at elevated temperatures. Here, the first direct evidence is provided of the durability of the type II refractive index change in BK7 glass. The investigation was performed for over 27 months at room temperature. The results show the existence of the laser pulse intensity threshold above which the magnitude of the index change does not deteriorate with time and, hence, is suitable for optical memory, photonic crystal and fibre-grating writing. © 2019},

abstract={The choice of uranine (UR) and sulforhodamine B (SRB) as hydrological tracers has recently been questioned since they might interact with the soil or become degraded. In this context, microbiological degradation of UR and SRB and the factors influencing it remain poorly studied. Here, we conducted a long-term mesocosm experiment where the effects of plants and hydrologic conditions on the dissipation and degradation of UR and SRB was separately investigated. Mass balances were combined with excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy to characterize microbially-derived organic matter. Results revealed that most of SRB accumulated in the sand while UR was mainly found in the pore water. The estimated degradation of UR and SRB was greater in the treatments with plants and under unsaturated conditions. Overall, UR exhibited higher presumable degradation than SRB. Two components were identified by parallel factor analysis of the EEMs in addition to the UR-related component (U), one humic-like of high molecular weight primarily derived from terrestrial or soil organic matter sources (A + C) and a second humic-like of lower molecular weight related to recent microbial activity (M). A high positive correlation (Spearman's rho = 0.74, p < 0.001) between M and U suggested a possible link, in which the presence of UR fostered microbial processes, thus supporting the hypothesis of biodegradation of UR, which seemed independent of the presence of plants, whereas it was not possible to point out such a correlation for SRB. These results show for the first time that plants and the alternation of oxic and anoxic conditions are favourable to increase degradation of UR and SRB and that microbiological degradation can be involved and dominant in UR dissipation. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={To study the atmospheric moisture transport processes from the source to a receiver region, isotopic analysis of rainwater from Port Blair (as source region), the Andaman Islands, Bay of Bengal has been carried out. In addition to the island site, rainwater collected at three sites on the Indian mainland (as receiver region) namely Nagpur, Kolkata, and Tezpur has also been isotopically analyzed. We present a daily variation of long-term (2012–2015) record of rain isotope from Port Blair to understand the moisture dynamics on a sub-seasonal timescale. It was observed that the Port Blair rainwater oxygen isotope ratios (δ18O) maintain a temporally dependent correlation with the average rainfall over the Core Monsoon Zone (CMZ) of India, though the seasonal rainfall over these two regions appears to be mutually independent. Rain isotopes are controlled more by the moisture dynamics rather than the individual rainfall events. Consequently, the correlation between rainfall over the CMZ and δ18O of Port Blair rain provides conclusive evidence of the transport of the Bay of Bengal (BoB) moisture to the central and the northeast Indian regions during the summer monsoon season. The spatial dependency of Port Blair rain-isotopes with the CMZ rain shows interannual variability and also indicates different pathways of the BoB moisture to the Indian mainland within a given season. The pathways of the source moisture to the receiver are identified by the trajectory analysis with Port Blair being the source area. We observed analogous variation in δ18O of island rain and that of the mainland rain, and δ18O at these two regions is modulated by the monsoon intra-seasonal oscillation (MISO). The correlation between the two isotopic records appears to arise from the propagation of the rain/cloud band from the Bay to the Indian landmass and the associated moisture transport linked to the MISO. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: To evaluate the association between contraceptive knowledge and type of method used. Methods: We analyzed data from a cross-sectional study of sexually active women in Hanoi, Vietnam, not desiring pregnancy. We used linear and logistic regression to evaluate contraceptive knowledge of users of the intrauterine device (IUD), combination oral contraception (COC) and male condoms. We measured contraceptive knowledge with seven questions on relative effectiveness of methods, reversibility, covert use, contraindications and side effects. Results: Respondents used IUD (n = 128), COC (n = 126) or condoms (n = 167). Summary knowledge scores did not differ by current type of method used. Only one knowledge domain, contraceptive effectiveness, varied by method. Compared to condom users, IUD users had higher odds of correctly identifying the IUD as more effective than COC, condoms and withdrawal (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 4.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7–8.3). Higher proportions of condom users (49.7%) mistakenly identified condoms as the most effective of listed methods compared to IUD (20.3%) and COC users (23.0%). On the other hand, IUD and COC users had lower odds (aOR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.2–1.0 and aOR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1–0.6, respectively) of identifying consistent condom use as better for pregnancy prevention than other practices (e.g., withdrawal and postcoital douching). Conclusions: IUD users more often recognized that the IUD is highly effective while condom users appeared to overestimate condom effectiveness. Contraceptive counseling should ensure that women understand the relative effectiveness of methods. We found no evidence that other types of contraceptive knowledge differed by type of method used. Implications: Knowledge of contraceptive effectiveness was the sole difference detected in contraceptive knowledge between women in Hanoi, Vietnam, using the IUD, COC or male condoms. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objectives: In approximately 15% of cases of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), an obvious source of bleeding cannot be identified by angiography; these are considered cases of SAH of unknown etiology. A rare case of cisternal pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) presenting with SAH is reported. The usefulness of the balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) sequence for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect small cisternal lesions is discussed. Case Description: The case of a 73-year-old woman who developed repeated SAHs owing to a cisternal PA is presented. She experienced sudden onset of headache and vomiting, and brain computed tomography showed diffuse SAH, whereas angiography demonstrated normal vasculature. Follow-up imaging, including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, T1-weighted contrast-enhanced, and diffusion-weighted MRI, did not show any parenchymal or cisternal lesions, although computed tomography and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI showed SAH in the same region. In contrast, the bSSFP sequence, taken as a different sequence on the same day, showed mixed-intensity reticular lesions in the left basal cistern, while neither hematoma nor positive findings were identified with the other sequences. Based on the radiologic finding and the repeated history of SAH, the lesions were partially removed 2 weeks after onset. Histological examination showed a PA. Conclusions: Despite being extremely rare, a small cisternal lesion should be considered as a cause of SAH of unknown etiology. The bSSFP sequence may be useful for detecting cisternal lesions that may be missed on the routine MRI sequences. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={While analytic calculations may give access to complex-valued electromagnetic field data which allow trivial access to envelope and phase information, the majority of numeric codes uses a real-valued representation. This typically increases the performance and reduces the memory footprint, albeit at a price: In the real-valued case it is much more difficult to extract envelope and phase information, even more so if counter propagating waves are spatially superposed. A novel method for the analysis of real-valued electromagnetic field data is presented in this paper. We show that, by combining the real-valued electric and magnetic field at a single point in time, we can directly reconstruct the full information of the electromagnetic fields in the form of complex-valued spectral coefficients (k→-space) at a low computational cost of only three Fourier transforms. The method allows for counter propagating plane waves to be accurately distinguished as well as their complex spectral coefficients, i.e. spectral amplitudes and spectral phase to be calculated. From these amplitudes, the complex-valued electromagnetic fields and also the complex-valued vector potential can be calculated from which information about spatiotemporal phase and amplitude is readily available. Additionally, the complex fields allow for efficient vacuum propagation allowing to calculate far field data or boundary input data from near field data. An implementation of the new method is available as part of PostPic 1 , a data analysis toolkit written in the Python programming language. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={A study was conducted to assess the projected impact of future climate on Alamo Lake and the Bill Williams River basin. We analyzed simulations of three-selected Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 Global Climate Models (GCM) (i.e. HadGEM2-ES, MPI-ESM-LR and GFDL-ESM2M). These GCMs which, were part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report, were selected as well performing GCMs that represent the historic climatology and prevailing precipitation bearing synoptic conditions in the southwest US. An analysis of both statistically and dynamically downscaled simulations projected increase in the frequency of dry winters during the mid-21st century (2020–2059) in two out of the three selected GCMs. For summer precipitation, the statistically downscaled simulations are inconclusive whereas, the dynamically downscaled simulations showed significant but contradicting future projections. In order to assess the impact of the projected climate on the hydrologic cycle at the Bill Williams River basins, we developed a modeling framework that includes the following components: 1) a weather generator that produces realizations of likely hourly precipitation events over the basin; 2) a hydrologic model that is based on the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center (CBRFC), National Weather Service modeling configuration that predicts flow at ten internal points and inflow into Alamo Lake; and 3) a lake model with the existing operation rules to simulates the lake outflow and levels. Using the above-described modeling framework, the impact of the projected mid 21-century climate on Alamo Lake was examined with respect to the total outflow from the dam, the frequency of large outflow events, and the frequency of high and low lake levels. The results show that dynamic downscaling provides a larger range of impacts than those provided by statistical downscaling. The results also indicate a wide range of impact scenarios with contradicting trends among the selected climate projections for mid-21st Century. These results imply increasing challenges in operating the Lake at its target level. This modeling framework can potentially be used to examine various future scenarios and to develop recommendations for a sustainable management scheme for the Alamo Lake. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Objective: To describe the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) offerings of transition to practice training programs for certified primary care nurse practitioners in the United States. Study design: Program Directors from all identified primary care training programs (n = 51) were invited to participate in an online survey to assess the SRH didactic and clinical offerings based on competencies developed by the World Health Organization and adapted for the US across 15 domains and 15 related procedures. Results: Twenty-two (43%) surveys were completed. There was considerable variation in offerings, with no single domain required by all programs, nor any program requiring trainees to complete didactic and clinical offerings in all domains. On average, programs required didactic and clinical training for approximately a third of the competencies in the Reproductive Tract Cancers domain (the most required domain) and for approximately a quarter of the competencies in the Contraceptive domain. Infertility/Fertility and Environmental Risks to Reproductive Health were the least commonly required domains. Clinical training tended to be more frequently required or offered than didactic instruction in almost all domains. Regarding procedures, both didactic and clinical training on insertion and removal of intrauterine devices were required by one third of programs. No-scalpel vasectomy was the procedure in which programs were least likely to offer trainees either didactic or clinical training, followed by uterine aspiration for missed or elective abortion or heavy menstrual bleeding. Conclusion: Although SRH is recognized as an essential component of primary care, its inclusion in transition to practice primary care training programs for NPs is low and inconsistent. Implications statement: Preparing primary care NPs to deliver competent SRH care is important for workforce development and patient care. Our study highlights a need for additional research to determine the baseline competency in SRH care among primary care NPs in order to further enhance education, training and policies with this aim. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: To assess whether young men's reports of hormonal and long-acting contraceptive methods match their female partner's reports. Study design: We analyzed a sample of 1096 heterosexual couples (aged 18–26) from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health Romantic Pair subsample. We compared male and female partner reports of hormonal/long-acting method use using class of method (hormonal/long-acting) rather than type (e.g., intrauterine device). Regression analyses linked men's reports of individual and relationship characteristics with alignment of reporting. Results: Sixteen percent of young men reported hormonal/long-acting method use at last sex differently than their female partner, that is, had a mismatched report. Men who had fewer lifetime sexual partners, had greater relationship satisfaction, believed their partner was monogamous and had a matched report of condom use at last sex were more likely to match their partner's report of hormonal/long-acting contraceptive use. Men living with children (from either partner) were less likely to have a matched report. Hispanic men were more likely to have a matched report than black men. Conclusions: Men are an increasingly important part of pregnancy prevention efforts. Pregnancy prevention and healthy relationship programs that incorporate communication skills may also indirectly improve young men's knowledge of their partner's contraceptive use and engagement in contraceptive decision making. Implications: Analyses showed that nearly two thirds of the 16% of young men that did not accurately report their partner's hormonal/long-acting method use at last sex underreport method use. Men at increased risk of misreporting may benefit the most from targeted pregnancy prevention programs. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Background: Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is a benign disease caused by the hyper excitement of facial nerves owing to vessel compression. The offending vessels are usually arteries, such as anterior and posterior inferior cerebellar or vertebral arteries, but there are few reports of vein involvement cases. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate veins as offending vessels in patients with HFS confirmed by abnormal muscle response (AMR). Methods: We analyzed 5 patients with HFS caused by veins among 78 patients with HFS over the past 10 years. All patients underwent microvascular decompression (MVD) with AMR monitoring, whereas 3 of them underwent a second MVD. The mean follow-up time was 97 months. Results: Arteries were thoroughly decompressed in 3 patients with a failed first MVD surgery who received a second surgery, during which veins at the root exit point (RExP) were decompressed with the disappearance or a significant decrease in the amplitude of AMR. Two patients showed spasm resolution after the first surgery when veins were decompressed together with the disappearance of AMR. The location of veins was RExP and the cisternal portion. All patients had excellent outcomes within 3 months, and no complications were observed. Conclusions: Veins can be offending vessels in HFS patients. AMR is useful to determine the endpoint in these cases. Once arteries are decompressed thoroughly with residual AMR, surrounding veins at unusual sites, such as the RExP or the cisternal portion, must be checked to prevent persistent HFS. Complete decompression of veins leads to a good clinical outcome. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The conditional hyperbolic quadrature method of moments (CHyQMOM) was introduced by Fox et al. [19] to reconstruct 1- and 2-D velocity distribution functions (VDF) from a finite set of integer moments. The reconstructed VDF takes the form of a sum of weighted Dirac delta functions in velocity phase space, and provides a hyperbolic closure for the spatial flux term in the corresponding moment equations derived from a kinetic equation for the 3-D VDF. Here, CHyQMOM is extended for 3-D velocity phase space using the modified conditional quadrature method of moments with 16 (or 23) trivariate velocity moments up to fourth order. In order to verify the numerical implementation, it is applied to simulate several canonical particle-laden flows including crossing jets, cluster-induced turbulence (CIT), and vertical channel flow. The numerical results are compared with those from Euler–Lagrange simulations and two other quadrature-based moment methods, namely, anisotropic Gaussian (AG) and 8-node tensor-product (TP) quadrature. The relative advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. The crossing-jet problem highlights that CHyQMOM handles particle crossing more accurately than AG. For CIT, the results from all methods are similar, but the computational cost of TP is significantly larger than AG and CHyQMOM, both of which have nearly the same cost. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={A novel polygeneration concept, which has been proposed recently, comprises a fuel-cell calciner integrated system in order to produce electricity and lime which can be used for direct air capture (DAC) to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. However, the scalability of the integrated system needs to be further studied. In this work, calcination of limestone under steam-rich conditions simulating flue gas from a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), and subsequent ambient carbonation has been explored. Limestone was calcined under two steam concentration (21% and 35% vol) conditions in a 25 kWth pilot-scale bubbling fluidised bed (BFB), and then exposed to ambient air to evaluate DAC performance. Samples were characterised in order to quantify the hydration and carbonation conversions over time and, therefore, their DAC capacity. It was observed that steam reduces calcination time, confirming its catalytic effect, while the calcination temperature remained the same regardless of the steam composition at the same CO2 partial pressure. Moreover, increasing steam concentration during calcination affected the material performance and DAC capacity at ambient conditions positively. Therefore, these findings demonstrate that limestone calcined under typical SOFC afterburner exhaust conditions is suitable as a DAC sorbent. © 2019},

abstract={Ambient pollutant concentrations in Paris, France are routinely measured by the local surface-monitor network of the AIRPARIF agency. Such networks, however dense, have a limited spatial representativeness around the monitoring-site and are not capable to represent the strong horizontal gradients of pollutant concentrations over urban areas. High resolution models simulate 3D pollutant concentration fields at a spatial resolution as fine as a few meters over the urban area by integrating the underlying emission sources and accounting for the effect of buildings on the dispersion patterns. These models, provide a good spatial variability over the urban area but suffer from uncertainties related to the emission inventories, meteorological fields and parametrizations of the physical and chemical processes. In this paper, simulations conducted by ARIA Technologies with the Parallel Micro-Swift-Spray (PMSS) model (https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.aria.fr_projets_aircity&d=DwIGaQ&c=sJ6xIWYx-zLMB3EPkvcnVg&r=hPRQO-QHqXhD8p9F43Mezw&m=5Ygbn-ChjRk5z0uQS3lymjWAtJDFin15cLna7hnk9fc&s=jX7zKqF9SkD9YCmu0byKNKOFA3BOOnIiMNyA6AjTzpg&e= ) are used to assess NOX and PM10 representativeness areas around five urban background and five traffic-oriented monitoring-sites of the AIRPARIF network during ten days in March 2016. Commonly, the spatial representativeness of a monitor site is defined through homogeneity areas, namely the area around a monitoring-site where pollutant concentration is above 20% of the concentration at the location of the monitoring-site. Here, we propose a novel approach that uses similarity areas to define the spatial representation of monitor sites. Similarity areas integrate points that respect the additional condition to be highly correlated in time with the concentration at the monitor station. Thus, the criterion to select similarity areas is a combination of a high value of the correlation coefficient and a small value of the normalized root mean square error with regards to the concentration at the grid-cell corresponding to the location of the monitor. Criteria thresholds are determined through an iterative analysis and a representative area is defined through image processing that selects all the connected pixels that satisfy criteria thresholds and incorporate the grid-cell of the monitor. Daily similarity areas estimated around each monitor are compared against homogeneity areas with regards to their shape, spatial extent, and urban specific characterization. Around urban background sites they are of the same order of magnitude, whereas around traffic sites similarity areas are generally larger than homogeneity areas. PM10 representativeness areas are found to be 2.2 times larger than the NOX ones. Urban background areas are representative of the broad neighborhood around the monitoring-site, whereas traffic-oriented monitoring-sites are representative of specific urban features such as sections of roads and sidewalks along the road. Averaged over the 10 days of the study and across all monitoring-sites, representativeness areas for urban background monitoring-sites are about 8 times larger than traffic representativeness areas (0.6 km2 vs. 0.07 km2). © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objectives: To describe the types of contraception used by women attending Title X-funded clinics and a comparable group of low-income reproductive-age women at risk of unintended pregnancy. Study design: We estimated the percentage of reproductive aged (15–44 years) women using contraception, by method type and level of effectiveness in preventing pregnancy (i.e., most, moderately, and less effective), using Title X Family Planning Annual Report (2006–2016) and National Survey of Family Growth (2006–2015) data. We divided most effective methods into permanent (female and male sterilization) and reversible (long-acting reversible contraceptives [LARCs]) methods. Results: Among Title X clients during 2006–2016, use of LARCs increased (3–14%); use of moderately effective methods decreased (64–54%); and use of sterilization (~ 2%), less effective methods (21–20%), and no method (8–7%) was unchanged. These same trends in contraceptive use were observed in a comparable group of women nationally during 2006–2015, during which LARC use increased (5–19%, p <.001); moderately effective method use decreased (60–48%, p <.001); and use of sterilization (~5%), less effective methods (19%), and no method (11–10%) was unchanged. Conclusions: The contraceptive method mix among Title X clients differs from that of low-income women at risk of unintended pregnancy nationally, but general patterns and trends are similar in the two populations. Research is needed to understand whether method use patterns among low-income women reflect their preferences, access, or the conditions of the supply environment. Implications: This study contributes to our understanding of patterns and trends in contraceptive use among two groups of reproductive-age women — Title X clients and low-income women nationally who are at risk of unintended pregnancy. The findings highlight areas for further research. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: The objective of this study was to compare Rh alloimmunization rates in two countries (Canada and the Netherlands) with completely different policies regarding abortion-related use of anti-D immunoglobulin to ultimately determine any benefit in use. In the Netherlands, the policy is to offer anti-D immunoglobulin to Rh-negative women having spontaneous abortions over 10 weeks 0 days gestation and induced abortions over 7 weeks 0 days. In Canada, it is recommended to offer all Rh-negative women having induced or spontaneous abortions anti-D immunoglobulin. Methods: We used public databases to obtain the population data, the number of births, the abortion rates (the percentage of women having induced abortions in one year) and the Rh-negativity rates (percentage of Rh negative women) in Canada and the Netherlands. Both countries do routine prenatal blood screening and we obtained the rates of clinically significant antibodies from public databases. Results: In nearly 2 million blood samples from pregnant women in both Canada and the Netherlands, the prevalence of clinically significant antibodies was statistically lower in the Netherlands: 4.21 (95% CI: 4.12 to 4.30) and 4.03 (95% CI: 3.93 to 4.12) per 1000, respectively. Canada and the Netherlands had small differences in rates of abortion (1.9 per 100 vs 1.2 per 100) and of Rh negativity (13.0% vs 14.5%). Conclusion: Despite different anti-D Ig treatment policies, we found a similar prevalence of clinically significant perinatal antibodies among women in Canada and the Netherlands. Implications: Our findings suggest that The Dutch policy of not treating Rh-negative women having spontaneous abortions under 10 weeks’ or induced abortions under 7 weeks’ gestation can be safely adopted by other countries. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={The Kilauea volcano in Hawai'i has been erupting continuously since 1983. The eruptions are a major source of air pollution. Sulfur oxides released from the volcano react with sunlight, atmospheric gases and aerosols, and convert to fine particles. The resulting volcanic smog, known as vog, is a recognized health hazard. Data sets for volcanic emissions, sulfur dioxide gas and particulate matter are analyzed. Volcanic emissions are available at a daily resolution. Emissions show evidence of nonlinear variability, and intermittent trending over periods of several months. Forecasting tests at horizons of 1–7 days find that emissions can be predicted only with a substantial error. Air quality data is available hourly. Forecasting experiments for SO2 and particulate matter are run over horizons of 1–24 h and 1–7 days, using time series models. Volcanic emissions were tested as causal inputs in the models for the SO2 and particulate matter data, but were found to increase the forecast error. The daily and hourly SO2 series are predicted more accurately by ARIMAs. The results for particulate matter are more ambiguous. Over short horizons, they are often predicted better by regressions on levels or simple persistence models. At horizons associated with cycles (24 h, 7 days), ARIMAs and persistence forecasts achieve the most accurate results. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={During the last decades, mid-infrared (3–12 μm) laser sources using crystals with nonlinear optical properties have attracted a particular attention due to their potential applications in different fields such as optical counter-measures and remote chemical sensing. As transparency of common oxide crystals is limited to about 4 μm, many researches have been focused on chalcopyrite compounds because of their wide transparency in the mid-IR range and their strong nonlinear optical coefficients. There is a need of such crystals able to convert efficiently the near infrared wavelengths from commercially available lasers into wavelengths higher than 5 μm through Optical Parametric Oscillators (OPO) systems. This paper presents a new compound: ZnGa 2 Se 4 (ZGSe). Measurements made on dense polycrystals show a high thermal conductivity value in comparison with other selenides (2.9 W m −1 K −1 ), a wide transparency from visible to beyond the band III of the mid IR (0.6 μm–17 μm) and a coefficient of thermal expansion inferior to 10 −5 K −1 . These results are very encouraging and improvements of the growth process are now undertaken to obtain single crystals with the required optical quality. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Over the past 15 years there has been a proliferation of projects aiming to restore the structure and function of UK upland blanket mires, primarily by revegetation of bare peat and the blocking of erosion gullies. These restoration measures have potential to alter stormflow responses and contribute to Natural Flood Management, but their impacts on storm hydrographs are poorly quantified. This paper reports a before-after-control-intervention (BACI) study from three experimental headwater micro-catchments in the South Pennines (UK) representing the first rigorous experimental assessment of the impact of blanket peat restoration on catchment runoff. We evaluate the hydrological impacts of two standard restoration interventions; revegetation of bare peat, and revegetation of bare peat with additional gully blocking. Following revegetation there was a significant decrease in depth to water table and an increase in the prevalence of hillslope overland flow production. There were no significant changes in storm runoff coefficient following either restoration treatment. Storm hydrographs following revegetation had significantly longer lag times (106% increase relative to the control), reduced peak flows (27% decrease relative to the control), and attenuated hydrograph shapes. With the addition of gully blocking the effect is almost doubled. Lag times increased by a further 94% and peak flows reduced by an additional 24% relative to the control. We argue that the primary process controlling the observed changes in storm hydrograph behaviour is retardation of overland stormflow due to increased surface roughness. The significant changes to lag times and peak flow provide evidence that the restoration of degraded headwater peatlands can contribute to Natural Flood Management and the reduction of downstream flood risk, subject to wider catchment scale effects and sub-catchment storm hydrograph synchronicity. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={CHEMKIN software was used to optimize the reaction mechanism of sodium in flue gas to study the influence of targeted design for purely burning Zhundong (ZD) coal on boiler characteristics. Then, the optimized 32-step elemental reaction was combined with CFD software. An eddy-dissipation concept model considering detailed chemical reactions was used to simulate the transformation behavior of sodium-containing substances. The combustion characteristics of the 660 MW face-fired boiler under various loads were also simulated. The field distribution in the furnace and the migration path of sodium along the track of pulverized coal particles were obtained. The results show that the interference between each burner in the furnace is small at the BMCR load, and the phenomenon of “wind wrapping fire” is distinctly clear. The temperature at furnace outlet is approximately 970.98 °C. At a low load, the combustion in the furnace is stable, and the temperature at the furnace outlet reaches the design value. The sodium present in ZD coal is involved in the reaction after it is released in the form of Na and NaCl. Sodium is present in different forms in the main burner zone, mainly NaCl (67%), NaOH (12%), Na (9%), and Na2SO4 (7%). The forms of sodium at the furnace outlet are NaCl (50%), Na2SO4 (37%), Na2Cl2 (9%) and NaHSO4 (4%). A small amount of Na2SO4 is formed by NaHSO4 reaction in the main burner zone. It then reacts to form NaSO4, wherein NaHSO4 is formed by path 2. Na2SO4 is mainly generated in the burnout zone through path 1, and paths 2, 3, and 4 are hardly observed. The findings of this research can provide reference for the design of a purely fired ZD coal boiler and further studies on slagging observed on the heating surface. © 2019 Energy Institute},

abstract={The extraction into aqueous solution of total soluble iodine (TSI), iodide and iodate were examined as a function of extraction times between 5 and 60 min for two different extraction methods and from two types of commonly used aerosol collection substrates. The extraction methods tested were ultrasonic agitation and mechanical shaking, while the substrates were cellulose fibre (CF) and glass fibre (GF). Tests were carried on substrates spiked with known amounts of iodide and iodate and on a pair of ambient aerosol samples collected at the University of East Anglia on both substrates over the same time period. The combination of ultrasonic agitation and CF substrates (which has been used in many published studies of aerosol iodine speciation) was shown to lead to variable recovery of iodine species and changes in speciation over extraction time. Mechanical shaking of GF substrates gave good recoveries of iodide and iodate from spiked experiments and stable speciation with time for the ambient aerosol sample. This combination is recommended for future use in the determination of aerosol iodine speciation. Mechanical shaking also appeared to be preferable to ultrasonic agitation for samples that were collected on CF substrates. The optimised conditions (mechanical shaking of GF substrates for 30 min) were applied to the analysis of samples collected during the Stratospheric ozone: Halogen Impacts in a Varying Atmosphere (SHIVA) cruise in the South China and Sulu Seas in November 2011. The results obtained showed variable proportions of iodide, iodate and soluble organic iodine species in these samples, with iodide concentrations possibly related to airmass history and background chemistry. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={The dynamic analysis and optimal design of reactive extraction are challenging due to high nonlinearity of model equations and tough decision of judging criteria. In this work, a dynamic rate-based method is developed on gPROMS platform to get easy access to the solutions of reactive extraction with phase splitting. Based on rigorous criteria, dynamic analysis from initial state to final equilibrium (e.g., evolution of phase composition, mass transfer rate and reaction rate) and optimal design of operating conditions (e.g., extractant dosage and feed molar ratio) are achieved. To illustrate the method, the esterification of n-hexyl acetate is taken as an example. The approach proves to be reliable in the analysis and optimization of the exemplified system, which provides instructive reference for further process design and simulation of reactive extraction. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Similar to the obstacle or medium scattering problems, an important property of the phaseless far field patterns for source scattering problems is the translation invariance. Thus it is impossible to reconstruct the location of the underlying sources. Furthermore, the phaseless far field pattern is also invariant if the source is multiplied by any complex number with modulus one. Therefore, the source can not be uniquely determined, even the multi-frequency phaseless far field patterns are considered. By adding a reference point source into the model, we propose a simple and stable phase retrieval method and establish several uniqueness results with phaseless far field data. We proceed to introduce a novel direct sampling method for shape and location reconstruction of the source by using broadband sparse phaseless data directly. We also propose a combination method with the novel phase retrieval algorithm and the classical direct sampling methods with phased data. Numerical examples in two dimensions are also presented to demonstrate their feasibility and effectiveness. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={An original strategy to address hydrodynamic flow was recently proposed through a high-order weakly-compressible Cartesian grid approach [1]. The method, named Weakly-Compressible Cartesian hydrodynamics (WCCH), is based on a fully-explicit temporal scheme for solving the Navier-Stokes equations while implicit incompressible schemes are usually preferred in the literature to address such flows. The present study aims to position and compare the WCCH method with a standard incompressible formulation. To this end, an incompressible scheme has been implemented in the same numerical framework. As far as possible, the algorithm used in the incompressible approach has been designed to be the same as (or close to) the one used in the weakly-compressible approach. In particular, high-order schemes for spatial and time discretization are employed. Pros and cons for each formulation are discussed in conjunction with a series of test cases on extensive criteria including implementation convenience, easy use of mesh refinement, convergence order and accuracy, numerical diffusion, parallel CPU scaling for high performance computing, etc. These comparisons demonstrate the relevance of the incompressible approach, at least for the selected test cases. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Lateral nanoindentation provides access to the scratch hardness of glass surfaces. The specific sensitivity of the scratching experiment to surface mechanical properties can be enhanced when the local load at the tip apex is reduced. Here, we report on ramp-load scratch tests on a range of silicate glasses using a sphero-conical tip shape. Similar as with regular scratching experiments using sharp indenters, such tests create a sequence of micro-ductile, micro-cracking, and micro-abrasive regimes. Detailed investigation of the indenter displacement h and of the lateral force FL as recorded in situ, however, reveals pronounced deviations in comparison to Vickers or Berkovich scratching experiments. Most notably, this includes an abrupt increase in both h and FL at moderate normal load, marking the onset of ductile fracture, and a yield point at the transition from fully elastic deformation to the elastic-plastic regime at low load. For the range of examined silicate glasses, we find that structural cohesion controls yielding, whereas scratch-induced fracture and micro-abrasion are dominated by the volume density of bond energy. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a potent neurotoxin that is receiving increasing interest in the European Union because it has been found in different fishery products (fish, bivalves and gastropods) captured in European waters. Since available information is scarce, further analytical data regarding the incidence of this toxin in European fishery products is needed in order to perform an appropriate risk assessment devoted to protecting consumers’ health. Hence, samples of bivalves and gastropods were collected at different points of the Spanish coast and analyzed by high-performance hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS) to evaluate the presence of TTX. None of the analyzed samples showed TTX above an internal threshold of 10 µg/kg or even showed a peak under it. Our results on TTX occurrence obtained in bivalve molluscs and gastropods did not show, at least in the studied areas, a risk for public health. However, taking into account previous positive results obtained by other research groups, and since we did not detect TTX in our samples, a more completed study increasing sampling frequency is needed to ensure proper risk evaluation towards the food safety of these products. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Soil was sampled and XAD-2 based passive air samplers were deployed for one year at several locations on four mountains and a mountain pass in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The mountains, ranging between ca. 1100–1500 m in altitude, varied in their proximity to likely sources of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Considered mountain-by-mountain, proximity to sources determines the concentrations of PCBs: Grouse Mountain, immediately to the North of Vancouver, had the highest PCB concentrations in both atmospheric gas phase and soil, while three other mountains in southern BC had levels approximately a factor of three lower. PCB concentrations along the Chilkoot Trail in remote Northern BC were more than an order of magnitude lower. While Grouse Mountain also had the highest PAH concentrations, gas phase concentrations of PAHs elsewhere were only slightly lower and varied little between the different mountains. Soil concentrations of PAHs were highly elevated on urban Grouse Mountain and lowest on Blue Grouse Mountain, which stands out by having the driest climate. On a site-by-site basis, PCB concentrations in the atmospheric gas phase decreased with increasing elevation but show indication of upslope enrichment in the soils of three of the mountains. These include the most urban mountain and two rural mountains, which have more precipitation and forest coverage than the remaining two mountains. There was no difference between congeners in the extent of upslope enrichment, indicating that the temperature gradient along the mountains was not sufficiently large to cause fractionation. Atmospheric gas phase and soil concentrations of PAHs on a mountain decrease with distance from likely sources. Although sources of PAHs are too widespread to observe any trends of mountain cold-trapping, PCBs are clearly experiencing cold-trapping in Western Canadian mountains. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={Preferred particle orientation presents a major challenge for many single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) samples. Orientation bias limits the angular information used to generate three-dimensional maps and thus affects the reliability and interpretability of the structural models. The primary cause of preferred orientation is presumed to be due to adsorption of the particles at the air/water interface during cryo-EM grid preparation. To ameliorate this problem, detergents are often added to cryo-EM samples to alter the properties of the air/water interface. We have found that many bacterial transcription complexes suffer severe orientation bias when examined by cryo-EM. The addition of non-ionic detergents, such as NP-40, does not remove the orientation bias but the Zwitter-ionic detergent CHAPSO significantly broadens the particle orientation distributions, yielding isotropically uniform maps. We used cryo-electron tomography to examine the particle distribution within the ice layer of cryo-EM grid preparations of Escherichia coli 6S RNA/RNA polymerase holoenzyme particles. In the absence of CHAPSO, essentially all of the particles are located at the ice surfaces. CHAPSO at the critical micelle concentration coats the air/water interface and eliminates particle absorption there, allowing particles to randomly orient within the vitreous ice layer. We find that CHAPSO reduces orientation bias for a number of bacterial transcription complexes containing E. coli or Mycobacterium tuberculosis RNA polymerases. Findings of this study confirm the presumed basis for how detergents can help remove orientation bias in cryo-EM samples and establishes CHAPSO as a useful tool to facilitate cryo-EM studies of bacterial transcription complexes. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor (RGNT) is a rare and distinct primary nervous system tumor. The literature on this novel neoplasm is sparse and limited to mostly case reports. Reviews on the characteristics of this tumor are fewer and far between with the latest up to a decade old. We thus provide a comprehensive review of recent literature to characterize presenting symptoms, radiological evidence, treatment options, and prognosis of this novel neoplasm. A Medline search for case reports detailing primary rosette-forming glioneuronal tumors was performed. RGNTs are a benign tumor of indolent course with mixed glial and neurocytic components. There is a slight female predominance with mean age of presentation at 23.57 years. Headaches, visual disturbances, and nausea and vomiting are the most common symptoms. Most RGNTs have solid and cystic components, arising most frequently in the fourth ventricle or cerebellum. Management is usually through surgery with gross total resection (GTR) providing better prognosis. © 2019, Federación de Sociedades Españolas de Oncología (FESEO).},

abstract={Genetically encoded reporter proteins are important and widely used tools for the identification and capture of a promoter, tracking the dynamic behavior of transcription, and the quantification of promoter activity. The sensitivity of the reporter gene is a critical factor for an ideal reporter system because weak transcriptional signal has usually failed to be detected using classical reporters. In this study, we present a novel reporter system for improved monitoring of transcription in E. coli based on β-galactosidase α-complementation. In this reporter system, the β-galactosidase activity resulting from the assembly of a reporter lacZα and an existing α-acceptor in advance serves as a measure of transcriptional activity in vivo. To validate the potential of the lacZα-derived reporter system, a series of artificial operons were constructed, and the moderately strong lac promoter, ara promoter, and weak pbr promoter were chosen as the detection promoters. The response profiles of lacZα was similar to that of wild type lacZ in artificial lac operons. Due to its small size and efficient expression profile, the detection sensitivity of a lacZα-derived reporter system was significantly higher than that of the traditional full-length β-galactosidase and the fluorescent protein mCherry reporter system in artificial ara operons. As expected, the response sensitivity of the lacZα-derived reporter system was also demonstrated to be significantly higher than that of the β-galactosidase and mCherry reporter systems in lead-sensitive artificial pbr operons. The lacZα-derived reporter system may prove to be a valuable tool for detecting promoter activity, especially low-level transcription in vivo. © 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

abstract={Snakebite is predominantly an occupational disease affecting poor rural farmers in tropical regions and was recently added to the World Health Organisation list of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD). We document an overview of methodologies developed and deployed in the Myanmar Snakebite Project, a foreign aid project largely funded by the Australian Government, with the core aim to “improve outcomes for snakebite patients”. A multidisciplinary team of experts was assembled that worked in a collaborative manner with colleagues in Myanmar, first to identify problems related to managing snakebite and then develop interventions aimed to improve selected problem areas. A broad approach was adopted, covering antivenom production, antivenom distribution and health system management of snakebite. Problems identified in antivenom production included poor snake husbandry resulting in poor survival of captive specimens, lack of geographical diversity; poor horse husbandry, resulting in high mortality, inadequate stock acquisition protocols and data collection, and inappropriate immunisation and bleeding techniques; and inadequate production capacity for freeze dried antivenoms and quality control systems. These problems were addressed in various ways, resulting in some substantial improvements. Antivenom distribution is being reorganised to achieve better availability and utilisation of stock. Health system management of snakebite was assessed across all levels within the area selected for the study, in Mandalay region. A comprehensive community survey indicated that hospital statistics substantially underestimated the snakebite burden, and that access to care by local villagers was delayed by transport and cost issues compounded by lack of antivenom at the most peripheral level of the health service. A health system survey confirmed under-resourcing at the local village level. Prospective case data collection initiated at tertiary hospitals indicated the extent of the snakebite burden on health resources. Interventions initiated or planned include training of health staff, development of a core of senior trainers who can “train the trainers” nationwide in a sustainable way, development and deployment of management guidelines and algorithms for snakebite and a distribution of solar powered fridges to remote health facilities to allow storage of antivenom and prompt treatment of snakebite cases before transfer to major hospitals, thereby reducing the “bite to needle” time. © 2018},

abstract={The Myanmar Snakebite Project is an Australian government (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade) supported foreign aid project in collaboration with the Myanmar government with the aim of improving outcomes for snakebite patients in Myanmar. As part of the project a case record database was established to document prospective cases of snakebite presenting to Mandalay General Hospital, in Upper Myanmar. The study period was 12 months (1-2-2016 to 31-1-2017). Snake identity was based on a mixture of identified dead snakes brought with patients, doctor's clinical opinion and patient identification. 965 patients were enrolled during the 12 month period, of whom 948 were included for analysis. The male: female ratio was 1.58:1. Most cases involved bites to the lower limbs (82.5%) and adults involved in farm work, confirming snakebite as an occupational disease in this community. Motorised transport was by far the most common form of transport to health care and most patients sought care from the health system (87.7%), not traditional healers (11.5%) as their first point of contact. The officially promoted application of a pressure pad, bandage and immobilisation as first aid for snakebite was almost never used, while most patients used some form of tourniquet (92.0%). 85.4% of cases where a snake ID was listed were bitten by Russell's vipers. Russell's viper bites were responsible for all fatalities (9.8% of cases) and all cases of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). For all cases, clinical features included local swelling (76.5%), local pain (62.6%), AKI (59.8%), incoagulable blood (57.9%), regional lymphadenopathy (39.8%), nausea/vomiting (40.4%), thrombocytopenia (53.6%), abdominal pain (28.8%), shock (11.8%), secondary infection (8.6%), panhypopituitarism (2.1%). AKI required renal replacement therapy (RRT) in 23.9% of cases, all ascribed to Russell's viper bite. Green pit viper bites were the next most common cause of bites (7.6%) and were associated with incoagulable blood (29%) and occasionally shock (5%) and local necrosis (3%), and in one case AKI not requiring RRT. In contrast to Russell's viper bites, green pit viper bite was most likely to occur in the home (49%). Some green pit viper patients were treated with Russell's viper antivenom (15%), presumably because they had incoagulable blood, although this antivenom is not effective against green pit viper envenoming. For the entire patient group, antivenom was given in 80.5% of cases. The most common indications were presence of coagulopathy/non-clotting blood (59.8%), local swelling (47.4%), oliguria/anuria (19.8%), heavy proteinuria (19.4%). A febrile reaction to antivenom was reported in 47.9% of cases, while anaphylaxis, occurred in 7.9% of cases. © 2018},

abstract={In this study the glass transition temperatures (Tgα and Tgβ) in mesoporous silica-based amorphous drugs were characterized. For this purpose, mesoporous silica Parteck SLC (MPS) was loaded with the drugs ibuprofen and carvedilol, either below, at, or above the monomolecular drug loading capacities, i.e. the concentration at which the entire MPS surface is covered with a monolayer of drug molecules. The resulting amorphous forms were analysed using X-ray powder diffraction and the thermal behaviour was characterised with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The drug monolayer did not contribute to the thermal signal in DSC. Using DMA however, it could be shown that the monolayer indeed exhibited a very weak Tgα, and that the temperature range of this transition did not differ from that of the quench cooled amorphous drugs. Theoretical ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the nature of hydrogen bonding geometry of the functional groups interacting with the MPS surface were similar to that of the respective crystalline drugs, which results in restricted molecular motions for those functional groups. On the other hand, the non-interacting parts of the molecules exhibited molecular motions similar to what is observed in pure amorphous drugs. As a result of the interactions of the monolayer with the MPS surface, the monomolecular drug layer did not reveal a Tgβ. However, a Tgβ was found at any drug-MPS ratios above the monomolecular drug loading capacity as a result of the excess drug which forms a "true" amorphous phase. Overall, this study demonstrated that drug molecules forming an amorphous monolayer on the surfaces of a mesoporous silica particle, even though they are restricted in their mobility, exhibit a Tgα, but lack a Tgβ, whereas any excess drug confined in the MPS pores showed similar properties as the pure amorphous drug. These findings will help to increase the overall understanding of drug loaded MS systems, including their physical stability as well as release properties. © the Owner Societies 2019.},

abstract={The well-known translation invariance property of the phaseless far field patterns with incident plane waves make it is impossible to reconstruct the location of the underlying scatterers even for multiple incident directions and frequencies. To overcome this difficulty, we take the superpositions of plane waves and point sources as the incident fields. The point sources have fixed source location with at most three different scattering strengths. By adding a reference sound-soft obstacle into the scattering system, we show some uniqueness results with phaseless far field data. Of possibly even more interest are the phase retrieval technique and direct sampling methods, without using the reference obstacle. With the help of the point sources, we propose a simple and stable phase retrieval algorithm and design some novel direct sampling methods using the phaseless data directly. The novel phase retrieval algorithm can then be combined with the classical sampling methods for scatterer reconstruction. Finally, we present a variant of numerical examples in two dimensions to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithms. © 2019 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

abstract={Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were made on AMgF3:Mn (A = Na, K, or Rb) before and after X-ray irradiation. F-centre/Mn (F/Mn) complexes were seen in all samples after irradiation where the energy levels are perturbed from the original Mn2+ levels. The perturbed energy of each level depends on the total angular momentum and decreased for the Mn2+ 4G levels and increased for the 4D levels. KMgF3:Mn contains two F/Mn complexes where the second complex has a significantly smaller Mn2+ perturbation for low energies. The Mn2+ crystal field parameters have been calculated from the PL data and 10Dq is found to be smallest for the largest ionic radius, where A = Rb. Oxygen-related PL is observed in all compounds. Our measurements of the F/Mn complex energies will assist in computational and theoretical studies of these complexes, which is important given their potential application in radiation dosimetry. © 2019},

abstract={The abundance and fluxes of selected dissolved trace elements (TE), nutrients, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were quantified in the Atchafalaya River Basin to better understand its influence on the chemical regime of the Louisiana Shelf, a region where bottom water hypoxia occurs annually during late spring to early fall. Water samples were collected from throughout the entire Atchafalaya River Basin including from the Mississippi and Red Rivers as well as basin swamp waters during April and November 2010, and June 2011, which represent “typical” high and low, and “unusual” high river discharges, respectively. Within the total dissolved (<0.45 µm) pool, most of the TEs were mainly partitioned to the <0.02 µm dissolved phase with the exception of Cr, Cs, Fe, Pb and Zn which were dominantly in the colloidal (0.02–0.45 µm) phase. In the Atchafalaya River, seasonal concentration variations in nutrients, DOC and most TEs were similar to those in the Mississippi River, reflecting a major contribution of water from the Mississippi River. Contributions of the Red River to the Atchafalaya River's DOC and nutrients were estimated to be 1–35%, similar to previous estimates for this system. The Red River contribution to the fluxes of Co, Cr, Cs, Fe, Mn, Pb, Rb, and Zn was generally disproportionally high (>20%), exceeding its hydrological contribution (∼10%) to the Atchafalaya River, due to greatly enriched concentrations of these elements in the Red River. The Atchafalaya River Basin wetland/floodplain contribution to chemical constituents was noticeable, accounting for more than a 20% decrease of some elements (Cd, Cs, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mo, P, U, and Zn). Mn was the only element with persistent addition during all sampling campaigns. However, the contributions from the Red River were greater than the wetland/floodplain contributions for DOC, nutrients and most of TEs (except Mn), suggesting that the Red River plays a disproportionate role in regulating water quality in the Atchafalaya River. Overall, the Atchafalaya River with its chemical modification of Mississippi River water via contributions from the Red River and interactions with floodplain wetlands, plays a critical role in chemical distributions on the Louisiana Shelf in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Thus, the Atchafalaya River contribution should be adequately accounted for in biogeochemical studies and models of trace elements and nutrients on the Louisiana Shelf, particularly during periods of bottom water hypoxia. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Biophysical agricultural models are needed for assessing science-based mitigation options to improve the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural cropping systems. It is crucial that they can accurately simulate soil hydrology and nutrient flows which strongly influence crop growth, biogeochemical processes and water quality. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of the DeNitrification DeComposition model (DNDC), which utilizes simplified hydrologic processes, to a more comprehensive water flow model, the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2), to determine which processes are sufficient for simulating water and nitrogen dynamics and recommend improvements. Both models were calibrated and validated for simulating soil hydrology, nitrogen loss to tile drains and crop biomass using detailed observations from a corn (Zea mays L.) -soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) rotation in Iowa, with and without cover crops. DNDC performed adequately across a wide range of metrics in comparison to a more hydrologically complex model. Soybean and corn yield, and corn biomass over the growing season were well simulated by both models (NRMSE < 25%). Soybean yields were also very well simulated by both models (NRMSE < 20%); however, soybean biomass was over-predicted by RZWQM2 in the validation treatments. The magnitude of winter rye biomass and N uptake was well simulated but the timing of growth initiation in the spring was inaccurate at times. The annual and monthly estimation of tile flow and nitrogen loss to tiles drains were well simulated by both models; however, RZWQM2 performed better for simulating soil water content, and the dynamics of daily water flow to tile drains (DNDC: NSE −0.32 to 0.24; RZWQM2: NSE 0.35–0.69). DNDC overestimated soil water content near the soil surface and underestimated it in the deeper profile. We recommend that developments be carried out for DNDC to include improved root density and penetration functions, a heterogeneous and deeper soil profile, a fluctuating water table and mechanistic tile drainage. However, the inclusion of computationally intensive processes needs to be assessed in context to improved accuracy weighed against the model's broad applicability. © 2018},

abstract={The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has developed the PRObability of Streamflow PERmanence (PROSPER) model, a GIS raster-based empirical model that provides streamflow permanence probabilities (probabilistic predictions) of a stream channel having year-round flow for any unregulated and minimally-impaired stream channel in the Pacific Northwest region, U.S. The model provides annual predictions for 2004–2016 at a 30-m spatial resolution based on monthly or annually updated values of climatic conditions and static physiographic variables associated with the upstream basin. Predictions correspond to any pixel on the channel network consistent with the medium resolution National Hydrography Dataset channel network stream grid. Total annual precipitation and percent forest cover were consistently the most important predictor variables among global and most subregional models, which had error rates between 17 and 22%. Probabilities were converted to wet and dry streamflow permanence classes with an associated confidence. Wet and dry classifications were used to derive descriptors that characterize the statistical and spatial distribution of streamflow permanence in three focal basins. Predicted dry channel segments account for 52–92% of the stream network across the three focal basins; streamflow permanence decreased during climatically drier years. Predictions are publicly available through the USGS StreamStats platform. Results demonstrate the utility of the PROSPER model as a tool for identifying areas that may be resilient or sensitive to drought conditions, allowing for management efforts that target protecting critical reaches. Importantly, PROSPER's successful predictive performance can be improved with new datasets of streamflow permanence underscoring the importance of field observations. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Renewable energies from residential photovoltaic systems can be used in the electricity sector as well as in the residential heating sector. Therefore, sector coupling, for example by using heat pump systems, is mandatory. Integrated homes use photovoltaic energy for space heating and domestic hot water to contribute to the decarbonization of the heating sector. The economics are a key to increasing the market penetration of integrated homes. Combined operation strategies for the electricity sector as well as for the heating sector can enhance the economics of these systems. This paper analyses different operation strategies for both electrical and thermal systems and examines the gain in efficiency by combined strategies. Furthermore, the dimensioning of the different system components heavily influences the economics of the integrated home. Capital-intensive components, such as photovoltaic generators, battery storage systems, heat pumps, and thermal storage units, play a major role for the profitability. Therefore, the optimization of component sizing is necessary in order to enhance the economics of the system. This paper presents optimization results based on the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. The results of the paper indicate that combined operation strategies as well as the optimization of the component sizes strongly influence the economics of photovoltaic battery energy storage systems with power-to-heat coupling. The impact of the optimization on the economic efficiency is higher compared to the influence of advanced combined operation strategies. The optimization indicates that relatively small storage units are more economical. The use of the heating sector as additional storage for excess photovoltaic energy is only economical to a minor degree, because it reduces the coefficient of performance of the heat pump. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Colletotrichum gloeosporioides BIOMASS. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides biomass was submitted to ethanolic extraction (78 oC, 12 h) to remove low molecular weight compounds followed by hot aqueous extraction (100 oC, 4 h, 4x) to obtain polysaccharides. Consecutive freezing/thawing treatments of the aqueous extract yielded a soluble fraction in cold water that was separated on five components (PI to PV) by gel exclusion chromatography on Sepharose CL-6B. The PIV was homogeneous on HPSEC/RID, with apparent MW of 2.8 x 104 g mol-1, Mw/Mn 1.17, 100% of total sugar. The PIV was composed by galactose (61%), glucose (34%) and mannose (5%). 1H and 13C NMR analysis mono- A nd two-dimensional, homo-(COSY) and heteronuclear (HSQC and HMBC) showed that PIV is a heteropolysacharide with a main chain constituted by β-D-galactofuranosidic units (1(5) and (1(6) linked with some of the β-D-galactofuranosidic (1(6) units substituted in O-3 by β-D-glucopiranosidic residues. Cytotoxic assays (MTT) indicated that the viability of CHO-K1 cells, when exposed to different heteropolysaccharide concentrations, did not show significant differences when compared to the viability of the negative control (CN), in the experimental times of 24 and 48 hours. These results suggest the possibility of new cytotoxic assays in other normal cell lines as well as in tumor cells. © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The reaction of the simplest Criegee intermediate CH2OO with NO2 is considered to be important in atmospheric chemistry because of its prospective contribution to the decay of CH2OO and the additional source of NO3, hence its effects on the NOx and HOx cycles. The reported rate coefficients of this reaction varied by a factor of 5. Employing a cw quantum-cascade laser with wavelength near 11 μm coupled with Herriott mirrors to probe CH2OO sensitively, we investigated in detail the reaction CH2OO + NO2 under total pressure 5.9-9.7 Torr at 298 K and reported a rate coefficient kNO2 = (1.0 ± 0.2) × 10-12 cm3 molecule-1 s-1, about one-seventh the value determined with direct measurements of CH2OO by Weltz et al. This smaller rate coefficient implies that the title reaction contributes to the atmospheric source of NO3 and the decay of CH2OO much less than previously conceived. © 2019 the Owner Societies.},

abstract={Objectives: The clinical benefit of once-daily fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI) versus twice-daily budesonide/formoterol (BUD/FOR) for patients with symptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was demonstrated in a clinical trial setting (FULFIL [NCT02345161]). The lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis of FF/UMEC/VI versus BUD/FOR, based on FULFIL data, is reported here. Methods: A previously developed and validated GALAXY-COPD linked-risk equation model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of FF/UMEC/VI from the UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. Baseline characteristics and efficacy results from FULFIL and UK NHS reference cost data (2017) were included as inputs. Exacerbation rates (undiscounted), costs, life years (LYs; undiscounted) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated over a lifetime horizon. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3.5% per year, beyond one year, in accordance with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the results. Results: Predicted cumulative exacerbations per patient over a lifetime were 8.393 with FF/UMEC/VI and 10.456 with BUD/FOR. Patients receiving FF/UMEC/VI gained an additional 0.764 LYs and 0.492 QALYs, at an additional mean cost of £1,652, resulting in an ICER of £3,357 per QALY gained (95% confidence interval: £1,816, £5,194) compared with BUD/FOR. The ICER remained below £6,000 in all but one of the scenario and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Compared with BUD/FOR, treatment with FF/UMEC/VI was predicted to improve health outcomes at an additional cost that suggests it would be cost-effective for patients with COPD in the UK. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={This review examines estimations made over the last two decades of the wheat yield losses in India due to elevated tropospheric ozone (O3) and to aerosol pollution. Notwithstanding the poor record of O3 and solar radiation measurement in wheat regions, a reasonable estimate can be made yield losses around 2010. From an average of the more credible studies, this is around 30% compared to the yield which would have been achieved with 1970 solar radiation and O3 assumed to be &lt;40 ppb (parts per billion by volume). The results suggest that O3 causes two-thirds of the loss and reduced total solar radiation due to aerosols (but corrected for increased diffuse radiation) one-third. Ozone, in particular, appears to be still increasing. It is likely that increased stomatal conductance (e.g. due to more irrigation (97% of production now irrigated) and the unwitting consequence of breeding for increased potential yield) has added to current O3 losses. Much is known about the physiology of O3 damage in the wheat leaf and plant. What is lacking is a thorough search for genetic tolerance independent of stomatal conductance and potential yield penalties, and this requires, at least initially, many chamber and/or FACE (free-air CO2 enhancement) experiments under typical Indian field conditions. Genetic engineering could offer a solution for O3 but only in the long term. Other solutions to pollution damage are very limited, but earlier planting should help wheat escape the rising O3 level in the spring. The 40 million tonnes of wheat currently foregone annually by India due to these two pollutants, even if an overestimate, far exceeds estimates of wheat yield loss to date due to climate change and demands concerted action to reduce the sources of this pollution, bringing added direct advantages for other crops and for human health. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={Macro-scale models of coupled free flow and flow through a permeable medium often lack the capabilities to account for process-relevant complexities on the pore scale. Direct numerical simulation of such systems, on the other hand, inherently includes these micro-scale features but is only feasible for problems of very limited spatial and temporal extent. A new class of hybrid models aims to combine the individual strengths, i.e., computational efficiency and local accuracy on the micro scale, of models of different dimensionality. We propose, to our knowledge for the first time, a fully coupled model concept that involves a (Navier-) Stokes model for the free flow and a pore-network model for the porous domain. As a first step, we consider isothermal single-phase flow with and without component transport, but the model is open for extension for more complex physics. Appropriate coupling conditions guarantee the continuity of mass and momentum fluxes across the interface between the two domains. The coupled model is implemented in DUMU(Figure presented.), an open-source toolbox for the simulation of flow in porous media. We use a monolithic approach, i.e., all balance equations are assembled into a single system matrix and no coupling iterations between the submodels are required. Newton's method is applied to solve the potentially non-linear system of equations. The model is able to handle both structured and unstructured, randomly-generated networks. For the structured porous domains, the simulation results of the coupled model were compared to numerical reference solutions where excellent agreement was found, both for Reynolds numbers below one and around 400 in the free-flow channel. When applied to a geometrically complex unstructured network and considering compositional flow, clear paths of preferential flow could be identified which also locally affect the adjacent region of free flow at the respective interface. The ability to account for such pore-scale characteristics makes the model an interesting option, e.g., for simulating coupled flow problems that feature non-Fickian transport behavior or multi-phase flow, which will be investigated in future work. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the antifertility activity and vaginal irritation effects of tideglusib in vivo using rabbit models and to evaluate the cytotoxical effects of tideglusib to sperm, vaginal cells and vaginal bacteria (L. acidophilus) in vitro. Study design: We treated female rabbits with vaginal tideglusib 1 mM, nonoxynol-9 (N-9) or vehicle control (Poloxamer 407). In experiment 1, we sacrificed females (n = 6 each) after 10 days of daily administration and assessed vaginal histological changes using Eckstein irritation score. In experiment 2, females (n = 9 each) received estradiol benzoate to induce ovulation 24 h prior to vaginal treatment followed by introduction of a fertile male. These females underwent necropsy at the 21st day to assess pregnancy status. In experiment 3, we used an HTM-TOX IVOS sperm motility analyzer and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate the effect of tideglusib on human sperm samples. In experiment 4, we evaluated the effect of tideglusib on lactobacillus and vaginal cell growth in vitro. Results: The total irritation score of tideglusib vs. N-9 was 3.4 ± 2.07 vs. 7.8 ± 3.82, p <.05. The pregnancy rate of tideglusib, N-9 and control group was 11.1%, 0% and 88.9%, respectively. Tideglusib exhibited a dose-dependent spermostatic/spermicidal activity, and the minimum effective concentrations of tideglusib and N-9 were 8.724 ± 3.047 μM and 219.75 ± 41.78 μM, respectively. SEM and transmission electron microscopy revealed acrosomal membrane impairments caused by tideglusib. Tideglusib was much less toxic to vaginal cells and L. acidophilus than N-9 in vitro. Conclusions: Evaluation using rabbit models indicated that tideglusib is a prospective spermicidal contraceptive with low vaginal irritation effects. Implications: Tideglusib or tideglusib analogues may be a contraceptive with perspective to replace N-9. It is possible for a spermicide to balance spermicidal activity and vaginal/cervical irritation effects very well. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Production of synthetic natural gas (SNG) has received increasing attention due to the clean nature and unbalanced reserve of natural gas. One of the technical bottlenecks for SNG production is the lack of feasible catalyst for CO methanation process. Herein, Mg-Al mixed oxides were prepared as supports by the co-precipitation method and La promoter was subsequently introduced by the co-impregnation method for Ni-based methanation catalysts. The initial activity of the Ni/Mg-Al catalysts depended on molar ratio of Mg/Al. The Ni/MgAl2O4 catalyst exhibited the best activity among the catalysts with various Mg/Al molar ratios (2/1, 1/1, 1/2, 1/3). Enhanced low-temperature activity and improved high-temperature stability were realized on the La-promoted Ni/MgAl2O4 catalyst. The Ni-La/MgAl2O4 catalyst possessed CO conversion of 95.1% at 270 °C and remained stable for 100 h at 550 °C under ambient pressure at a WHSV of 72 000 ml/(h gcat). The effect of La promoter on the catalytic performance of the Ni/MgAl2O4 catalyst was elucidated by N2 sorption, XRD, TEM, H2-TPR, H2 pulse chemisorption, TG/DSC, and CO2-TPD characterizations. The obtained results demonstrated that the enhanced low-temperature activity was related to reduced size of Ni nanoparticles and increased reducibility of the catalyst. The improved high-temperature stability was associated with better sintering- and coke- resistance properties induced by stronger metal-support interactions and increased basic sites respectively. The present work suggests La-promoted Ni/MgAl2O4 catalyst as a promising candidate for efficient SNG production from synthesis gas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Torrefaction is an important thermal pretreatment method to produce solid biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass to replace coal for sustainable heat and power generation. In this study, a thermodynamic-based process simulation model was developed for an integrated biomass torrefaction and pelletization (iBTP) plant to conduct mass and energy balances and to determine equipment size and design parameters using an Aspen Plus simulation tool. The key unit operations of an iBTP plant consisted of a biomass drying, fuel combustion, torrefaction, grinding, pelletizing, and cooling operations. A solid convective rotary dryer was simulated to study the temperature profiles and moisture content of hot gas and solid biomass along the dryer length. A rotary kiln torrefaction reactor was modeled through pre-defined reactor modules to investigate the main thermal and electrical energy requirements. The reactor output parameters such as mass and energy yield, HHV, and torgas compositions were validated for a torrefaction temperature range of 230–290 °C. The other main unit operations including combustion, grinding, pelletization, and cooling were also simulated to conduct detailed thermodynamic mass and energy balances at an industrial scale (pellet production capacity of 100,000 Mg yr−1) from pine wood chip feedstock. When wood bark is used as an auxiliary fuel over natural gas (base case), a separate solid fuel burner unit was simulated. The total thermal energy consumption for the production of torrefied pellets were ranged from 5.2 to 14.1 MJ kg−1 with the torgas energy contributions of 30–90% for the torrefaction temperature range of 250–290 °C. For the base case torrefaction temperature of 270 °C, the overall thermal and electrical energy consumptions were 7.2 and 0.9, respectively for the Mg of torrefied pellets produced. The developed model can be used to conduct process economics and safety assessments of a commercial scale plant. © 2019},

abstract={Humidification-dehumidification (HDH) processes have proved to be a promising solution for small-scale desalination, appropriate for water production in off-grid locations where the water demand does not justify the installation of conventional large-scale systems. With this contribution, we investigate the design and operation of an HDH process coupled with photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) solar modules for the simultaneous generation of clean water and electricity. The HDH system consists of established technologies, namely a humidification column and a heat exchanger, and is simulated through a commercial software accounting for heat and mass transfer limitations. On the other hand, PVT modules are a relatively new technology and their performance is determined experimentally to characterize the simultaneous generation of electricity and heat under realistic operating conditions. Based on the maximum-efficiency ratio of water to air mass flow rates, the optimal design of the system is determined for a wide range of ambient conditions by evaluating the impact of saline water flow rate, PVT configuration and HDH size on the amount of clean water produced. Then, the optimal operation of the system is characterized as function of the ambient conditions for a fixed system design. The state of the system is represented by the maximum process temperature, at the outlet of the PVT modules, whereas the performance is evaluated in terms of clean water and electricity generation. Finally, a techno-economic assessment is carried out to compare the proposed technology against conventional solar-driven HDH units, which use thermal and photovoltaic panels, for a wide range of electricity price, ambient conditions, amount of yearly water produced and size of the HDH process. © 2019},

abstract={We report here thermoluminescence properties of Eu3+ doped Na2Sr2Al2PO4Cl9 phosphor via doping of singly, doubly and triply ionized ions on the basis of PL studies done for this sample. The proposed sample was synthesized using solid state reaction method. Vibrational feature of this phosphor was confirmed by FT-IR spectra. This sample shows high degrees of crystallinity. All subseries are irradiated with 60Co- γ (gamma) source and thermoluminescence studies were done for all subseries formed by doping of singly, doubly and triply ionized ions. The result shows that all the series give highest TL intensity at low dose rate. On doping of triply doped ionized ion (Y3+), TL intensity is enhanced to some extent. Deconvolution of broad TL glow data formed for some sample were done by using TLAnal computerized software. Thermoluminescence studies of these Eu3+ doped SrYAl3O7 phosphor were done by Nucleonix TL 1009I thermoluminescence (TL) reader. Trapping parameters of each phosphor such as activation energy (E), order of kinetics (b) and frequency factor (s) were calculated by Chen's peak shape method, Initial rise method and Ilich method. Thus, the singly, doubly and triply ionized ions co-doped with Na2Sr2Al2PO4Cl9: Eu3+phosphor may be used in high dose thermoluminescence dosimetric application in various fields. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.},

Specifically, a silica-glass clad, aluminum-metal foil wrapped crystalline Er:YAG (Y3Al5O12) rod was drawn (during which the aluminum metal oxidizes) into an erbium-doped yttrium aluminosilicate glass core fiber. The sesquioxide dopants in the core promote an intrinsically low Brillouin gain coefficient, deduced via additivity modeling and direct measurement to be 0.19 × 10−11 m/W. Fiber losses of 0.25 dB/m (1310 nm) were obtained as was a slope efficiency of 38.2%.

Two TL peaks at ∼170 °C and 220 °C were found to be directly connected with V-electron traps and were assigned to the release of first (170 °C) and second (220 °C) electron from VX Lu. It was evidenced that each of the two TL bands results from strongly overlapping components showing continuous distribution of energies.

abstract={Quantum computers have an enormous impact on quantum chemical calculations. Approaches to calculate the energies of atoms and molecules on quantum computers by utilizing quantum phase estimation (QPE) and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) have been well documented, and dozens of methodological improvements to decrease computational costs and to mitigate errors have been reported until recently. However, the possible methodological implementation of observables on quantum computers such as calculating the spin quantum numbers of arbitrary wave functions, which is a crucial issue in quantum chemistry, has been discussed less. Here, we propose a quantum circuit to simulate the time evolution of wave functions under an S2 operator, exp(-iS2t)Ψ〉, and integrate it into the QPE circuit enabling us to determine the spin quantum number of the arbitrary wave functions. We demonstrate that the spin quantum numbers of up to three spins can be determined by only one qubit measurement in QPE. © the Owner Societies.},

abstract={Crop Yield Loss (CYL) due to surface ozone substantially affects the Indian economy and the food availability for a billion residents. Nevertheless, the incurring losses over India remain uncertain due to limited measurements and significant uncertainties in the surface O3 simulated by chemistry-transport models, amongst other causes. Here, we revisit the ozone-attributable CYL using WRF-Chem model, with a set up previously shown to better reproduce the observed ozone variations over the contrasting chemical environments across the Indian region. WRF-Chem simulated ozone fields are converted to Accumulated Ozone above a Threshold of 40 ppbv (AOT40) for two primary crop growing seasons in India, i.e. Kharif (mid-June to mid-September), and Rabi (December to February). Relative Yield Losses (RYL) for wheat are found to be higher (∼21–26%) than those in a recent study based on observations (∼15%), as the model accounts for the rural chemistry which can be different from urban/suburban/high altitude environments where measurements are largely conducted. Additionally, RYL for rice estimated here (∼6%) is 3 times greater than a previous study using this model at a relatively coarser resolution to derive average surface ozone with a set of simulations with varying emission inventories, not evaluated in detail before deriving crop losses. The economic losses due to CYL estimated in this study (∼5 billion USD for wheat and 1.5 billion USD for rice) are on the higher side, when estimations from various studies are inter-compared (0.6–4.3 billion USD for wheat, and 0.5–1.5 billion USD for rice), for which increasing crop prices is also a contributing factor. Our study highlights an urgent need to conduct strategic ozone observations especially over agricultural fields, and the development of yearly regional-emission database to support policy making in India. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Six heavy metals - Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Se, and Pb among other elemental species were monitored in ambient PM2.5 at three near-road ambient air monitoring locations in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) with semi-continuous X-ray fluorescence (XRF) instrumentation over a period spanning January 1st, 2014 to June 30th, 2017. Land use in these air monitoring locations includes residential, institutional and industrial, thus, air monitoring is representative of typical urban areas. Ambient metal concentrations were found below Ontario's ambient air quality criteria. Temporal trends however indicated that high concentrations of Fe and Cu correlated with peak commuting and working hours on weekdays. To further understand the potential sources of these metals, scatterplots of metal concentrations and criteria pollutant gases were made on weekdays and weekends. These scatterplots reveal edges that are due to multiple sources of these metals. When these scatterplots are colour-coded by the hour of day, edges associated with the morning rush hour on weekdays for Fe and Cu (also Mn and Zn to a lesser extent) likely due to traffic-related emissions are more clearly-delineated from other edges arising from industrial or regional sources that were prevalent during other times of the day. Finally, an auxiliary receptor model was used to explore the potential source regions of these metals. It was observed that Mn, Fe and Cu had intense potential source regions within the GTHA on weekdays that diminished on the weekends, and in the case of Fe, the potential source regions in the GTHA were sensitive to the morning rush hour period, indicating that traffic-related emissions are a major source of Fe. Other metals, especially Zn, Se and Pb have source regions that are less sensitive to the morning rush hour period and are usually situated outside the GTHA. © 2019},

abstract={● AIM: To illustrate the isoform-specific role and mechanism of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) in mouse optic nerve axotomy induced neurotrauma. ● METHODS: We firstly investigated the expression of JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3 in the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) by double-immunofluorescent staining. Then we created optic nerve axotomy model in wild type as well as JNK1, JNK2, JNK3, isoform specific gene deficiency mice. With that, we checked the protein expression profile of JNKs and its active form, and quantified the survival RGCs number by immunofluorescence staining. We further explored the molecules underlying isoform specific protective effect by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting assay. ● RESULTS: We found that all the three isoforms of JNKs were expressed in the RGCs. Deficiency of JNK3, but not JNK1 or JNK2, significantly alleviated optic nerve axotomy induced RGCs apoptosis. We further established that expression of Noxa, a pro-apoptotic member of BH3 family, was significantly suppressed only in JNK3 gene deficiency mice. But tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and Fas, two key modulators of death receptor mediated apoptosis pathway, did not display obvious change in the expression. ● CONCLUSION: It is suggested that mitochondria mediated apoptosis, but not death receptor mediated apoptosis got involved in the JNK3 gene deficiency induced RGCs protection. Our study provides a novel insight into the isoform-specific role of JNKs in neurotrauma and indicates some cues for its therapeutics. © 2019, International Journal of Ophthalmology (c/o Editorial Office).

abstract={This study used the Source Loading and Management Model forWindows (WinSLAMM) to develop a set of calibrated hydrologic models for three types of regional permeable pavements-porous concrete pavement (PCP), permeable interlocking concrete pavement (PICP), and interlocking block pavement with gravel (IBPG). The objective was to assess the hydrologic performance of permeable pavements, including the runoff depth, peak discharge, percentage increment in runoff reduction of pavements as a function of rainfall depth, development area, and base aggregate porosity, respectively. The permeable pavements were monitored over a wide range of rainfall events in the semi-arid Lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas. Data regarding rainfall intensities, source characterizations, runoff coefficients, and pavement design were initialized asWinSLAMM input. Validation results showed that the calibrated models could over or under-predict runoff reduction within a 30% error range. PCP and IBPG were very effective and could be capable of handling storms as large as 50-year frequency over a 24-h time period. The modeling results showed that PCP might require a 50-60% lesser footprint area as compared to PICP and IBPG, respectively. Additionally, PCP might be able to store 30% additional runoff if the porosity of base aggregates was increased by 40%. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Objective: This systematic review aims to evaluate the benefits of oral continuous combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) in managing dysmenorrhea by comparing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of continuous vs. cyclic CHC use for the following outcomes: (a) reducing dysmenorrhea duration and frequency, (b) severity, (c) recurrence and (d) interference with daily activity. Study design: Cochrane, PUBMED and Popline databases were searched from 1934 to 2018 for all relevant studies evaluating CHC for treatment of dysmenorrhea. A study was selected if it (a) compared continuous regimen vs. cyclic regimen of oral CHC, (b) measured dysmenorrhea as a primary or secondary outcome, (c) was an RCT and (d) was published in English. Due to differences in CHC used and outcome measurement, a systematic analysis of individual study results and a limited meta-analysis were conducted. Results: Of 780 studies that were screened by title and abstract, 8 were included in the final analysis; 6 evaluated cyclic vs. continuous CHC, and 2 evaluated cyclic vs. extended/flexible CHC use. Quality of evidence was low for all outcome measures. Overall, compared to cyclic use, flexible/extended CHC resulted in 4 fewer days of dysmenorrhea. Studies revealed conflicting results for interference with daily activity, pain severity and pain recurrence. Side effects were few in both comparison groups. Conclusions: Continuous or extended/flexible CHC use may reduce dysmenorrhea duration compared to cyclic regimen; however, more rigorous research is needed. Implications: This systematic review shows that continuous CHC use may reduce dysmenorrhea duration compared to cyclic regimen, although the quality of evidence is low. Future double-blinded RCTs with more rigorous study design, consistent outcome measures and comprehensive outcome reporting are needed. © 2019},

abstract={Full configuration interaction (full-CI) calculations can be executed efficiently on quantum computers (QCs) by utilizing a quantum phase estimation algorithm (QPEA). In the QPEA-based full-CI on QCs, the preparation of the initial guess wave functions having large overlap with the full-CI root is crucial. Recently, we proposed a quantum circuit to prepare spin symmetry-adapted configuration state functions (CSFs) toward open shell electronic structure calculations of molecules on QCs. Here, we propose an improved quantum circuit, based on Serber construction of spin eigenfunctions, enabling us to prepare CSFs with much less and easier-to-implement quantum gates than the previously proposed one. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={Thirty-two 14-month old steers died during a period of four days (19–23 June 2017) after drinking from Junipers Reservoir (southeastern Oregon, USA) during a cyanobacterial bloom. Clinical and histopathological findings were consistent with acute liver disease, and microcystin-LR was present at 3000 μg/L in a reservoir water sample and at 7100 μg/L in the rumen contents of one of the mortalities. Serum biochemistry and histological examination indicated severe liver damage consistent with microcystin toxicosis. Microscopic observation of reservoir water samples, limited to frozen or poorly stored and partially degraded samples, indicated the presence of abundant Anabaena/Dolichospermum, but the presence of other toxic cyanobacteria such as Microcystis could not be excluded. Metagenomic analysis showed the presence in these samples of a single cyanobacterium whose cpcBA, rpoB and rbcL genes indicated membership in the Anabaena/Dolichospermum genus. The sequence of a complete mcy gene cluster with homology to previously identified Anabaena mcy genes was recovered. These results emphasize the capacity for Anabaena/Dolichospermum blooms to produce lethal levels of microcystin, posing a danger to public health and livestock. Further, our findings indicate that such occurrences can occur outside the far-northern latitudes in which microcystin-producing Anabaena have typically been found. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={The phenomenon of dichroism has been achieved in aluminophosphate glass via precipitation of plasmonic copper nanoparticles (NPs), and further revealed to enhance the orange-red emission of Sm3+ ions relevant to optical applications. The precursor amorphous material was synthesized by melt-quenching in ambient atmosphere. A subsequent heat treatment is shown to induce the precipitation of Cu NPs exhibiting distinct plasmonic behavior, and consequently manifest the dichroic effect wherein the material transmits blue light but scatters the red. Optical absorption and transmission electron microscopy analysis allow for a novel interpretation regarding the origin of the dichroic effect in copper nanocomposite glasses, namely an enhanced scattering due to plasmonic coupling between Cu NPs. The improved Sm3+ photoluminescence (PL) was achieved in an excitation-dependent fashion, manifested under non-resonant excitation conditions where divalent tin and monovalent copper centers can first absorb photons and subsequently participate in energy transfer to Sm3+ ions. Moreover, the PL enhancement is selective for Sm3+ emission transitions 4G5/2 → 6H9/2, 6H7/2 in resonance with the plasmonic band in the dichroic nanocomposite, thus suggesting that light scattering by Cu NPs plays an important role in the improved output. It is the first time to the author's knowledge that this type of effect is reported for copper and rare-earth co-doped glasses. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={In this paper, the La1−xCexCo0.5Ti0.5O3−δ perovskite materials were explored for steam reforming of biomass tar (SRT) reactions using toluene as a model compound at various steam-to-carbon conditions. The perovskite materials were also investigated for steam reforming reaction at 750 °C and 700 °C, respectively in the presence of poisonous compounds such as H2S and NOx. The role of Ce-doping to La1.0-Co0.5Ti0.5O3 material catalytic performances was also investigated. Among all the catalysts, catalyst composition of La0.8Ce0.2-Co0.5Ti0.5O3 displayed a stable toluene conversion of around 90% at 700 °C and S/C of 2 for a period of 22 h tested in toluene reforming reaction. Additionally, La0.8Ce0.2-Co0.5Ti0.5O3 catalyst displayed stable SRT performance in the presence of 500 ppm of NOx. On the other hand, by introducing 50 ppm of H2S during SRT reaction at 750 °C, all the catalysts showed deactivation behaviour. At the same reaction temperature regeneration of about 90% of activity was observed for La0.8Ce0.2-Co0.5Ti0.5O3 catalyst. Overall, the best catalytic performance of La0.8Ce0.2-Co0.5Ti0.5O3 catalyst is due to the availability of higher amount of surface Co species and oxygen vacancies than other catalysts. From XRD analysis of calcined, reduced and spent catalysts, the presence of perovskite structural phase was observed for all the La-based catalysts and negligible Co species agglomeration observed during SRT reaction. CO2-TPD studies showed that the basicity of La0.8Ce0.2-Co0.5Ti0.5O3 and La1.0Co0.5Ti0.5O3 catalysts was higher compared to other perovskite compositions. TGA and Raman analysis revealed, suppressed rate of carbon deposition for all the Ce-contained materials and the deposited carbon was mostly amorphous in nature. Finally, low carbon deposition rate and high surface oxygen mobility were the possible reasons for La0.8Ce0.2-Co0.5Ti0.5O3 catalyst's stable catalytic performance over other catalysts. © 2019},

abstract={A simple and rapid method was developed for the simultaneous determination of five preservatives, six artificial sweeteners, and nine synthetic dyes in kimchi using ultra-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS) with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The chromatographic separation was performed in 5.5 min using an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.7 µm) with a mobile phase composed of 0.002% trifluoroacetic acid and 10 mM aqueous ammonium acetate or 9:1 (v/v) methanol:acetonitrile. Linear calibration curves were obtained with correlation coefficients above 0.98. The limits of quantification ranged between 0.227 and 8.569 ng/mL, while the recovery values in kimchi samples were from 83.1 to 113.5%. Forty kimchi samples were analyzed for the food additives, with sweeteners detected in more than half of these samples. The most commonly detected sweetener was saccharin, and six of the kimchi samples contained a combination of sweeteners; dulcin, sucralose, acesulfame K, preservatives, and synthetic dyes were not detected. Based on these results, the developed method can be used for the rapid quality control of food additives in kimchi. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Besides their impacts on health, BTEX play an important role in the formation of secondary organic aerosols and ozone for which limit values are regularly exceeded in Paris megacity and Ile de France region. An enrichment by a factor of 3 in the C7–C9 aromatic fraction in the Paris atmosphere compared to other northern mid-latitude cities was shown in 2013. Here, we combined different approaches to investigate the role of transport-related sources in such enrichment (gasoline composition and vehicle fleet composition): a statistical analysis of a large BTEX dataset including multi-year and multi-site measurements (traffic, background, tunnel) and a coupled experimental and modelling analysis of liquid and headspace composition of representative fuels distributed in Ile de France region (SP95, SP95 E10, and SP98). For the latter the experimental set-up was designed to analyze the composition of 87 VOCs from C2 to C17 in both liquid and headspace phases. The model is able to predict the headspace composition at ± 15% and with an R2 &gt; 0.9. First a strong positive spatial gradient in BTEX composition at traffic stations is observed, with higher TEX-to-benzene ratio in Paris center compared to the suburbs and outskirts up to a factor of 2. This gradient reflects differences in fleet composition especially gasoline powered vehicles in Paris with a larger proportion of two-wheelers (15% in 2012). This gradient is also consistent with the inter-annual increase of TEX-to-benzene ratios along with the doubling of two-wheelers use and the decrease in the number of passenger cars. The gasoline evaporation model cannot solely explain the observed spatial variability. Finally, we investigated the potential contribution of two-wheelers to the aromatic enrichment in IdF region by introducing an additional unburned gasoline term to the model. The results support the suggestion that two-wheelers are a potential contributor to this enrichment. Considering the high use of two-wheelers in other European cities such as London or Barcelona if Europe is to decrease transport-related air pollution and inner city traffic, policy makers should consider finding alternatives to the conventionally-powered two-wheelers and supporting electric two-wheelers for example. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={Proteins that are unfolded in solution produce higher charge states during electrospray ionization (ESI) than their natively folded counterparts. Protein charge states can be further increased by the addition of supercharging agents (SCAs) such as sulfolane. The mechanism whereby these supercharged [M + zH]z+ ions are formed under unfolded conditions remains unclear. Here we employed a combination of mass spectrometry (MS), ion mobility spectrometry (IMS), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for probing the ESI mechanism under denatured supercharging conditions. ESI of acid-unfolded apo-myoglobin (aMb) in the presence of sulfolane produced charge states around 27+, all the way to fully protonated (33+) aMb. MD simulations of aMb 27+ to 33+ in Rayleigh-charged water/sulfolane droplets culminated in electrostatically driven protein expulsion, consistent with the chain ejection model (CEM). The electrostatically stretched conformations predicted by these simulations were in agreement with IMS experiments. The CEM involves partitioning of mobile H+ between the droplet and the departing protein. Our results imply that supercharging of unfolded proteins is caused by residual sulfolane that stabilizes protonated sites on the protruding chains, thereby promoting H+ retention on the protein. The stabilization of charged sites is due to charge-dipole interactions mediated by the large dipole moment and the low volatility of sulfolane. Support for this mechanism comes from the experimental observation of sulfolane adducts on the most highly charged ions, a phenomenon previously noted by Venter (J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2012, 23, 489-497). The "CEM supercharging model" proposed here for unfolded proteins is distinct from the charge trapping mechanism believed to be operative during native ESI supercharging. © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Outgassing of volcanic systems is a ubiquitous phenomenon. Yet the mechanisms facilitating gas escape from vesiculating magmas and lavas remain poorly understood. Pervasive outgassing is thought to depend on the efficient and abundant formation of permeable pathways. Here we present results from experiments designed to identify the conditions and mechanisms needed to form such permeable pathways. We use a foamed silicate melt (FOAMGLAS®) in our experiments as a proxy for natural vesicular melts. FOAMGLAS® cores are compressed under a range of temperatures and strain rates, and results are evaluated against the state of melt relaxation (parameterized using the Deborah number). We find that foam microstructure and rheological and outgassing behaviors evolve with strain and as a function of melt relaxation state. Relaxed melt foams harden during deformation but remain impermeable. As foams become less relaxed at higher strain rate and/or melt viscosity, they show complex responses to deformation (strain weakening and hardening) yet remain impermeable. Strain localization and formation of high-permeability bands occur only in highly strained, unrelaxed foams. However, these bands are thin and oriented perpendicular to the principal stress, resulting in limited outgassing. Permeable pathways do not readily form in foams; rather, high-porosity melts are “persistently impermeable.” Our results imply that vesicular silicic lavas may not outgas as efficiently as previously thought. Instead, sustained impermeability allows the lava to maintain low effective viscosities, and to flow extended distances. In addition, pore pressures may rise in deforming impermeable lavas, perhaps priming the lava for later explosive behavior. ©2019. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (C I/R) accelerates neuronal injury through the overproduction of reactive oxygen species due to mitochondrial dysfunction. Hesperidin has cerebroprotective effects due to its antioxidant and anti-apoptotic nature against oxidative damage caused by C I/R. The blood-brain barrier also limits the hesperidin passage into the cerebral region due to its poor bioavailability. Current research included analysis of binding energy, hesperidin inhibitory constant on inflammatory cytokines (TNF α, IL 6) and apoptotic protein (caspase 3), hesperidin nanoparticles prepared, and investigation of their defense against C I/R rats. Binding energy and IC50 of hesperidin on pathological proteins using AutoDoc. 1.5.6 and PyRx in silico tools were compared with thalidomide. The fabrication method was engaged in the preparing of nano-hesperidin, characterized by SEM assessment. Bilateral common carotid artery occlusion technique has been used in experimental rats to cause C I/R. Nano-hesperidin cerebroprotective activity was assessed by differing infarction magnitude, oxidative stress parameters, TNF α and IL 6, and hippocampal histopathology with rats treated with unformulated hesperidin. Hesperidin found stronger binding strength and IC50 was relative to thalidomide on TNF α, IL 6, and caspase 3. Nano-hesperidin with a size of 100–500 nm was shown in a uniform nano-size and spherical form. Nano-hesperidin-treated rats showed significantly increased glutathione (p &lt; 0.00***), catalase (p &lt; 0.01**), and total protein (p &lt; 0.001***), and decreased cerebral infarction size, TNF α (p &lt; 0.01**), IL 6 (p &lt; 0.01**), and malondialdehyde (p &lt; 0.05*), compared with hesperidin-treated ischemic rats. Therefore, hesperidin nanoparticles may confer protection to the neurons against ischemic injury compared with hesperidin treatment. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={There is a lack of fundamental knowledge on deep eutectic solvents, even for the most extensively studied mixtures, such as the mixture of cholinium chloride and urea, which prevents a judicious choice of components to prepare new solvents. The objective of this work is to study and understand the fundamental interactions between cholinium chloride and urea that lead to the experimentally observed melting temperature depression. To do so, the structure of urea was strategically and progressively modified, in order to block certain interaction centres, and the solid-liquid equilibrium data of each new binary system was experimentally measured. Using this approach, it was concluded that the most important interaction between cholinium chloride and urea occurs through hydrogen bonding between the chloride anion and the amine groups. Any blockage of these groups severely hampers the melting point depression effect. Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations were utilized to study in more detail this hydrogen bonding and its nuances. © 2019 the Owner Societies.},

abstract={The development of accurate and robust heat transfer correlations for gas–solids flows is integral to the development of efficient multiphase unit operations. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) has been shown to be an effective method for developing such correlations. Specifically, the highly-resolved fields present in DNS may be averaged for use at the macroscopic level. Most commonly, particle-resolved immersed boundary or thermal lattice Boltzmann methods are employed. Here we develop a hybrid DNS framework where the hydrodynamics are resolved by the lattice Boltzmann method and the temperature field by random walk particle tracking (Brownian tracers). The random walk algorithm provides an efficient means for simulating scalar transport and can easily handle complex geometries. However, discontinuous fields pose a significant challenge to the random walk framework – e.g., a particle and fluid with different diffusivities. We derive a technique for handling discontinuities via the diffusivity, arising at a particle–fluid interface, and implement said method within the tracer algorithm. In addition, the heat transfer coefficient in the random walk method is defined and a technique for handling phases with different volumetric heat capacities is also developed. Moreover, the present algorithm is shown to correctly characterize intra-particle temperature gradients present in high Biot number systems. Verification of the code is completed against a host of cases: effective diffusivity of a static gas–solids mixture, hot sphere in unbounded diffusion, cooling sphere in unbounded diffusion, and uniform flow past a hot sphere. Predictions made by the new code are observed to agree with analytical solutions, numerical solutions, empirical correlations, and previous works. © 2019},

abstract={This work is intended to report pertinent studies covering several aspects viz., spectroscopic, higher order non-linear optical studies and positron annihilation spectroscopic studies on lead zirconium silicate glass ceramics admixed with different contents of MnO. Lead zirconium silicate glasses mixed with small contents (up to 1.0 mol%) of MnO were prepared and crystallized by subjecting them to the prolonged heat treatment at crystallization temperature ∼ 830 °C. The structural analysis of the samples carried out using XRD, TEM, EDS and differential scanning calorimetric techniques has suggested that the glass ceramics are entrenched with coagulated poly-crystallites viz., Mn2SiO4, Pb2MnO4 and Pb3Mn7O15 that contain manganese ions in multiple oxidation states. These studies have also suggested that Mn2+ ions occupy octahedral as well as tetrahedral positions and the tetrahedral occupancy is predominant in the glass ceramic sample mixed 0.6 mol% of MnO (M6). Infrared, Raman, optical absorption and photoluminescence spectral investigations have further supported the above conclusions and indicated an increasing rigidity of the glass network (attributed to the enhanced tetrahedral occupancy of manganese ions) with increasing concentration of MnO up to 0.6 mol%. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopic studies (carried out with 22Na isotope source of strength 0.1 MBq) suggested the sample M6 contains the lowest magnitude of free volume space. This is attributed to the participation of the maximal concentration of Mn2+ ions in the glass network forming. Non-linear optical (NLO) studies using NIR Er-glass laser (λ = 1540 nm) indicated the highest intensity third harmonic generation (THG) beam in the glass ceramics doped with small contents (∼0.2 mol%) of MnO. Overall analysis of these results suggested that the samples with lower concentrations of MnO possess highly disordered internal structure and facilitated the increase of intensity of THG beam; Hence, such samples may be considered as potential candidates for the applications in the fabrication of various micro sized opto-electronic devices, for example, optical switches, optical cross-connectors, microbolometers, photovoltaics, light sensors etc. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={The creation of an effective second order nonlinearity via the process of thermal poling in materials such as glasses, which naturally lack any second order susceptibility, has been known since the early 1990s. In this review, we present a historical overview via an introduction presenting early evidence of second order nonlinear effects in glass to explain the working principles of the thermal poling technique. An overview is then given to the transfer of the technique from bulk materials to optical fibers. Different configurations of poling are presented and compared, namely the conventional anode-cathode set-up, the development of the cathode-less process and most recently, the induction poling technique, which allows for poling fibers without any physical contact between the embedded electrodes and the high voltage supply. 2D-numerical models of the induction poling technique are later presented. An overview is also given of the different solutions for embedding electrodes inside the cladding holes of the fiber. Apart from solid electrodes, the more recent results have been presented about the adoption of liquid electrodes, both metallic and aqueous. For the first time silica optical fibers have been thermally poled using tap water as electrode. Both these two main results, namely induction poling and the liquid electrodes can allow to overcome some of the apparently intrinsic limits shown by the thermal poling technique so far, such as for example the length of the nonlinear devices and the complexity of the geometrical structure of microstructured optical fibres, both solid and PCF. Finally, we review the most recent outcomes and published applications of periodically poled silica fibers from our group, including high harmonic generation and phase sensitive amplification. All these promising results demonstrate that the way towards a full exploitation of the thermal poling technique for all-fiber nonlinear photonics is opening up many new vistas. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Environmental research has widely utilized the ambient concentrations of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) modeled by the National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) program; however, limited studies have evaluated the model's performance. This study aims to evaluate the model-to-monitor agreement of the 2011 NATA data with the monitoring data reported to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS). Concentrations of 27 representative HAPs measured at 274 sites in the U.S. in 2011 were merged with NATA data by census tract. The comparison consisted of two steps for each HAP: first, the model-monitor difference at each site was compared with the limit of quantitation (LOQ); second, the modeled annual average was compared to the 95% confidence interval of the monitored annual average. Nationally, NATA could predict national medians of most HAPs well; however, it was unable to capture high concentrations. At individual sites, a large portion of model-monitor differences was below the LOQs, indicating they were unquantifiable. Model-to-monitor agreement displayed inconsistent patterns in terms of chemical groups or EPA regions and was strongly impacted by the comparison methods. The substantial non-agreements of NATA predictions with monitoring data require caution in environmental epidemiology and justice studies that are based on NATA data. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Electron transfer is the most fundamental reaction in chemistry, yet its exact mechanistic details are often complex. Laccases are important electron-transfer enzymes of substantial utility in bleaching, bioremediation, catalytic synthesis, and enzymatic fuel cells. These multi-copper oxidases catalyze the one-electron oxidation of substrates by outer-sphere electron transfer to a copper T1 site, and subsequent intramolecular electron transfer to a tri-nuclear copper site where O2 is reduced to water. Understanding the molecular mechanism of the first, supposedly rate-determining pure electron transfer step is of major fundamental and technological interest. It is widely thought that the difference in the half potentials of the substrate and the T1 copper enables the powerful electron abstraction from nearby substrates. However, the reorganization energy during electron transfer could also contribute to catalytic turnover. To explore this, we computed the self-exchange reorganization energies of 54 substrates with experimentally known activity or kcat data using density functional theory. We show that the energy costs of changing the substrate geometries during electron removal correlate significantly with experimental activity data with a physically meaningful direction of correlation. This means that substrate electronic reorganization, rather than only potential differences, plays a role in the activity of electron transfer proteins such as laccases. This finding is consistent with the Marcus theory and suggests that the first electron transfer step from substrate to T1 is rate-determining in the real enzymes; the electronic reorganization energies can rationalize "good" vs. "bad" laccase substrates, which has not previously been possible. © 2019 the Owner Societies.},

abstract={Thrombocytopenia is closely associated with heparin therapy and hematological disorders and other common diseases in patients admitted in the hospital. Globally, thrombocytopenic cases in hospitals leading to 80% of deaths are mainly due to refractory bleeding and lack of availability of platelet concentrates. Currently, chemical compounds for managing thrombocytopenia are needed. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of methanolic leaf extract of Bauhinia monandra as a potential antidote for treating heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). A total of 30 mice were used for the experimental study. The mice were divided into five Groups (I-V) of six mice each. Group I (normal control) was given distilled water only, and Group II (positive control) was given heparin only. Groups III, IV, and V (treatment groups) were given heparin and methanolic leaf extract of B. monandra at a dose of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg body weight (b. wt), respectively. Furthermore, blood samples were collected to determine the blood platelet count. Bleeding time and clotting time were also determined. This study showed that the mice in the group treated with methanolic leaf extract of B. monandra at a dose of 400 mg/kg b. wt had significantly (P < 0.05) higher platelet counts (225.10 ± 6.41) than the control groups: normal control (181.90 ± 11.38) and positive control (127.65 ± 5.79). It also significantly decreased the bleeding and clotting time. Acute toxicity test showed no significant physical and behavioral changes. The results from this study show that leaf methanolic extract of B. monandra is effective as an antidote for treating HIT. © 2019, Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Water is indispensable for Earth resilience and sustainable development. The capacity of social-ecological systems to deal with shocks, adapting to changing conditions and transforming in situations of crisis are fundamentally dependent on the functions of water to e.g., regulate the Earth's climate, support biomass production, and supply water resources for human societies. However, massive, inter-connected, human interference involving climate forcing, water withdrawal, dam constructions, and land-use change have significantly disturbed these water functions and induced regime shifts in social-ecological systems. In many cases, changes in core water functions have pushed systems beyond tipping points and led to fundamental shifts in system feedback. Examples of such transgressions, where water has played a critical role, are collapse of aquatic systems beyond water quality and quantity thresholds, desertification due to soil and ecosystem degradation, and tropical forest dieback associated with self-amplifying moisture and carbon feedbacks. Here, we aggregate the volumes and flows of water involved in water functions globally, and review the evidence of freshwater related linear collapse and non-linear tipping points in ecological and social systems through the lens of resilience theory. Based on the literature review, we synthesize the role of water in mediating different types of ecosystem regime shifts, and generalize the process by which life support systems are at risk of collapsing due to loss of water functions. We conclude that water plays a fundamental role in providing social-ecological resilience, and suggest that further research is needed to understand how the erosion of water resilience at local and regional scale may potentially interact, cascade, or amplify through the complex, globally hyper-connected networks of the Anthropocene. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Today it is still common practice to analyse pumping tests assuming Theissian conditions, resulting in interpretations that are at best grossly approximated, if not erroneous, with potentially negative impacts on the quality of water resource management. Over the last several decades, numerous technological advances in hydrogeology have been developed that make it possible to perform more realistic analyses of heterogeneous, non-purely Theissian flow systems (e.g. aquifers with non-uniform geometry and/or hydraulic properties). For this study a catalog of available behavioral flow models was compiled from the literature and consolidated into a unique interpretative scheme. This is based on two first-order flow modelling breakthrough developments derived from research works: the derivative analysis (Bourdet et al., 1983) and the flow dimension theory (Barker, 1988). Each derivative type-curve is segmented and converted into a sequence of stable flow dimensions, in order to integrate a large panel of models into a comprehensive conceptual hydrodynamic and interpretative framework. This allowed us to conduct a thorough discussion on a range of different hydraulic conditions and their associated most common responses to constant-rate pump tests, namely, the linear, bilinear, radial, and spherical flow regimes and various sequential combinations of these elementary flow regimes. The relevance of the catalogued behavioral flow models is examined based on the realism of their postulates and on their frequency of occurrence in the field.

abstract={In various mineralizing marine organisms, calcite or aragonite crystals form through the initial deposition of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC)phases with different hydration levels. Using X-ray PhotoEmission Electron spectroMicroscopy (X-PEEM), ACCs with varied spectroscopic signatures were previously identified. In particular, ACC type I and II were recognized in embryonic sea urchin spicules. ACC type I was assigned to hydrated ACC based on spectral similarity with synthetic hydrated ACC. However, the identity of ACC type II has never been unequivocally determined experimentally. In the present study we show that synthetic anhydrous ACC and ACC type II identified here in sea urchin spines, have similar Ca L2,3-edge spectra. Moreover, using X-PEEM chemical mapping, we revealed the presence of ACC-H2O and anhydrous ACC in growing stereom and septa regions of sea urchin spines, supporting their role as precursor phases in both structures. However, the distribution and the abundance of the two ACC phases differ substantially between the two growing structures, suggesting a variation in the crystal growth mechanism; in particular, ACC dehydration, in the two-step reaction ACC-H2O → ACC → calcite, presents different kinetics, which are proposed to be controlled biologically. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={P-Rex family Rho guanine-nucleotide exchange factors are important regulators of cell motility through their activation of a subset of small GTPases. Both P-Rex1 and P-Rex2 have also been implicated in the progression of certain cancers, including breast cancer and melanoma. Although these molecules display a high level of homology, differences exist in tissue distribution, physiological function, and regulation at the molecular level. Here, we sought to compare the P-Rex2 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain structure and ability to interact with PIP3 with those of P-Rex1. The 1.9 Å crystal structure of the P-Rex2 PH domain reveals conformational differences in the loop regions, yet biochemical studies indicate that the interaction of the P-Rex2 PH domain with PIP3 is very similar to that of P-Rex1. Binding of the PH domain to PIP3 is critical for P-Rex2 activity but not membrane localization, as previously demonstrated for P-Rex1. These studies serve as a starting point in the identification of P-Rex structural features that are divergent between isoforms and could be exploited for the design of P-Rex selective compounds. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Low-cost sensors for the measurement of fine particulate matter mass (PM2.5) enable dense networks to increase the spatial resolution of air quality monitoring. However, these sensors are affected by environmental factors such as temperature and humidity and their effects on ambient aerosol, which must be accounted for to improve the in-field accuracy of these sensors. We conducted long-term tests of two low-cost PM2.5 sensors: Met-One NPM and PurpleAir PA-II units. We found a high level of self-consistency within each sensor type after testing 25 NPM and 9 PurpleAir units. We developed two types of corrections for the low-cost sensor measurements to better match regulatory-grade data. The first correction accounts for aerosol hygroscopic growth using particle composition and corrects for particle mass below the optical sensor size cut-point by collocation with reference Beta Attenuation Monitors (BAM). A second, fully-empirical correction uses linear or quadratic functions of environmental variables based on the same collocation dataset. The two models yielded comparable improvements over raw measurements. Sensor performance was assessed for two use cases: improving community awareness of air quality with short-term semi-quantitative comparisons of sites and providing long-term reasonably quantitative information for health impact studies. For the short-term case, both sensors provided reasonably accurate concentration information (mean absolute error of ∼4 µg/m3) in near-real time. For the long-term case, tested using year-long collocations at one urban background and one near-source site, error in the annual average was reduced below 1 µg/m3. Hence, these sensors can supplement sparse networks of regulatory-grade instruments, perform high-density neighborhood-scale monitoring, and be used to better understand spatial patterns and temporal air quality trends across urban areas.

abstract={Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) is an essential biomolecule that participates in the redox homeostasis and synthesis of signaling compounds. NAD kinase (NADK) (EC 2.7.1.23 / 2.7.1.86) is the only enzyme capable of synthesizing NADP. This study offers an approach to the NADP metabolism in the parasite Giardia intestinalis, the etiological agent of giardiasis, a disease of high prevalence in America, Asia and Africa. Through bioinformatics tools a NADK enzyme candidate was identified, whose tertiary structure modeling demonstrated distinctive and universal motifs of characterized NADKs. The corresponding recombinant protein (His-GINADK) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and its partial purification was achieved by nickel affinity chromatography. Functional identification, which showed NADP synthesis, was completed through enzymatic assays evaluated by RP-HPLC. A cytosolic localization of the endogenous GINADK enzyme was observed in trophozoites throughout indirect immunofluorescence analysis, using polyclonal antibodies produced in mice by its immunization with the His-GINADK protein, purified from inclusion bodies. Taken together, our results contribute to the understanding of the NADP metabolism and the physiological role of NADK in the Giardia model. © 2019, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

abstract={In order to explore the association of long-term high light (HL) with leaf senescence in wheat, two wheat genotypes Xiaoyan 54 (HL-tolerant) and Jing 411 (HL-sensitive) grown in low light were subjected to HL for 2-8 d. The results showed that 6-8 d of HL led to dramatic decline of chlorophyll content, photochemical efficiency, and activity of Rubisco and antioxidant enzymes. Meanwhile, the content of malondialdehyde (MDA), soluble proteins, soluble sugars, superoxide anion, and ascorbic acid increased markedly. Additionally, the expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) was induced by HL. Xiaoyan 54 accumulated less MDA, soluble sugars, and superoxide anions but showed a higher ratio of reduced to oxidized ascorbic acid than that in Jing 411 under long-term HL stress. Moreover, most of the assayed SAGs were less induced in Xiaoyan 54 than that in Jing 411. Altogether, the reduction of antioxidant enzyme activities and accumulation of soluble sugars may result in long-term HL-induced leaf senescence. © The authors.},

abstract={Cells and extracellular matrix (ECM)are mutually interdependent: cells guide self-assembly of ECM precursors, and the resulting ECM architecture supports and instructs cells. Though bidirectional signaling between ECM and cells is fundamental to cell biology, it is challenging to gain high-resolution structural information on cellular responses to the matrix microenvironment. Here we used cryo-scanning transmission electron tomography (CSTET)to reveal the nanometer- to micron-scale organization of major fibroblast ECM components in a native-like context, while simultaneously visualizing internal cell ultrastructure including organelles and cytoskeleton. In addition to extending current models for collagen VI fibril organization, three-dimensional views of thick cell regions and surrounding matrix showed how ECM networks impact the structures and dynamics of intracellular organelles and how cells remodel ECM. Collagen VI and fibronectin were seen to distribute in fundamentally different ways in the cell microenvironment and perform distinct roles in supporting and interacting with cells. This work demonstrates that CSTET provides a new perspective for the study of ECM in cell biology, highlighting labeled extracellular elements against a backdrop of unlabeled but morphologically identifiable cellular features with nanometer resolution detail. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Background: Many patients with COPD are ventilatory limited and unable to tolerate effective levels of aerobic training. A scooter could be an enticing training modality if muscle activity is partitioned and distal leg muscle activity is emphasized. The aim of this study was to determine whether scooting might emphasize leg heaviness (desired muscle burden), relative to the breathing heaviness, when compared with walking. Methods: Participants completed two endurance tests, walking and scooting. The intensity for each targeted similar tolerable exercise times (t limit ) simulating comparable training session exposure. Participants scored (Borg 0-10 ) leg and breathing heaviness throughout each test and the slope calculated. Electromyography was used to quantify leg muscle activity. Results: 15 participants with COPD (mean[SD]: age = 64[11]y; FEV 1 = 52[17]%predicted; FEV 1 /FVC = 50[10]%) completed the study. Successful matching of intensity between modalities was demonstrated by similar t limit (difference [95%CI] = -0.3[-2.8 to 2.1]min). Scooting resulted in more (60[24 to 95]%) activity of the gastrocnemius in the propulsion and less (−82[-91 to −72]%) in the support leg. Rectus femoris activity was reduced (−68[-95 to −41]%) and increased (117[49 to 184]%) in the propulsion and support leg, respectively. There was no significant difference (0.1[-0.1 to 0.2]) in the relationship between breathing and leg heaviness when scooting was compared to walking. Conclusions: Scooting is associated with increased activity of the distal muscles of propulsion of the scooting leg. However, this is offset by the increased activity of the support leg as it resists the rotational force of propulsion, such that the relationship between breathing and leg heaviness is not altered. © 2019},

abstract={There is an incentive for dairy farmers to maximize crop production while minimizing costs and environmental impacts. In cold climates, farmers have limited opportunity to balance field activities and manure storage requirements while limiting nutrient losses. A revised DeNitrification DeComposition (DNDC) model for simulating tile drainage was used to investigate fertilizer scenarios when applying dairy slurry or urea on silage corn (ZeamaysL.) to examine N losses over a multidecadal horizon at locations in eastern Canada and the US Midwest. Management scenarios included timing (spring, fall, split, and sidedress) and method of application (injected [10 cm], incorporated [5 cm], and broadcast). Reactive N losses (NO3− from drainage and runoff, N2O, and NH3) were greatest from broadcast, followed by incorporated and then injected applications. Among the fertilizer timing scenarios, fall manure application resulted in the greatest N loss, primarily due to increased N leaching in non-growing-season periods, with 58% more N loss per metric ton of silage than spring application. Split and sidedress mineral fertilizer had the lowest N losses, with average reductions of 9.5 and 4.9%, respectively, relative to a single application. Split application mitigated losses more so than sidedress by reducing the soil pH shift due to urea hydrolysis and NH3 volatilization during the warmer June period. This assessment helps to distinguish which fertilizer practices are more effective in reducing N loss over a long-term time horizon. Reactive N loss is ranked across 18 fertilizer management practices, which could assist farmers in weighing the tradeoffs between field trafficability, manure storage capacity, and expected N loss. © 2019 The Author(s) and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada.

abstract={β-Ca3(PO4)2-type phosphors have received much attention due to their ability for heterovalent substitution of Ca2+ by different cations to form the new phases, and their abundant crystallographic sites for the doped activator, such as Eu2+, to tune the photoluminescence. Thus, these phosphors have great potential on the applications in white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) for their tunable emission. Accordingly, there is increasing interest in the discovery of new β-Ca3(PO4)2-type phosphors for WLEDs and the deep understanding on the mechanisms responsible for occupation by Eu2+ ions of particular sites in the host lattice, so that the modulation of emission color and intensity can be controlled. In this review, we summarized the structural construction of β-Ca3(PO4)2-type compounds based on such a mineral-inspired prototype evolution perspective. Then we reviewed the recent research on the luminescence properties and sites occupancy of Eu2+ ions in different β-Ca3(PO4)2-type phosphors. Finally, combining with the current advances, we proposed the research prospects and future work of β-Ca3(PO4)2-type phosphors. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Background: The association of obesity and asthma has been described in children and adults. However, whether a different life course of weight in men and women may explain gender differences in asthma incidence, has not been addressed. Objectives: Using data from the Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults, we investigated the role of overweight/obesity as measured by body silhouettes at different life stages in men and women for asthma incidence. Methods: Our analysis included 5417 subjects who were asthma free at age 8, followed up to 2011, and had complete covariate information. The main predictor of interest was self-reported body silhouettes at age 8, menarche, 30, 45, menopause, and 60, and additionally changes in body silhouette number across these different time points. Asthma incidence was defined as newly reported doctor-diagnosed asthma after the body silhouette time point. Asthma incidence and its association with body silhouettes was analysed using sex stratified logistic regression, adjusting for age, atopy, urbanity, smoking, parental asthma, education and study area. Results: Men at age 60 had an increased risk of asthma incidence per unit increase in body silhouette number (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.13–3.30). This association was stronger in women at age 60 (OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.49–5.18) and observed also at menopause (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.03–1.78), as well as per unit change in body silhouette number between age 45 – menopause (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.15–2.63). Conclusion: In this longitudinal study, the risk of incident asthma increased in men and women with a larger body silhouette in late adulthood. In women, this risk appeared present between age 45 and menopause. At age 60, both men and women were at higher risk of asthma incidence per unit increase in body silhouette, the risk being more pronounced in women. The age-related increase of obesity may underlie gender differences in asthma incidence at higher ages. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Depressional wetlands are dominant features in many low-gradient landscapes, where they provide water storage and exchange. Typical basin morphology enables water storage during drier periods, when surface flow paths are disconnected and exchange is limited to slower groundwater flow paths. Under wetter conditions, wetland stage can exceed surface connection thresholds, activating surface flow paths to downstream waters. Empirical methods are needed to quantify these dynamics and thus to assess their role in landscape hydrology and associated functions. We developed a new water budget-based approach to enumerate connectivity thresholds and flows from stage measurements. We propose that this approach, termed Connectivity and Flow from Stage (CFS), has broad applicability across wetlandscapes. We applied the CFS method in the Big Cypress National Preserve, where we hypothesized that surface connectivity episodes control water and solute flux, with consequences for exported carbonate weathering products and thus for karst landform evolution. Across five study wetlands, this analysis detected surface connectivity thresholds and assessed temporal flow dynamics. Imputed connectivity thresholds were clear from stage-dependent net flow dynamics and aligned well with LiDAR-derived thresholds. Water export occurred overwhelmingly when stage exceeded these thresholds, indicating that water and solute export from these wetlands is dominated by periods of enhanced landscape connectivity. Notably, the presented CFS method can quantify wetland connectivity thresholds from stage data, even without supporting geomorphic information. This approach is useful for understanding hydrologic controls on biogeomorphic evolution in this particular karst landscape, and more broadly for inferring wetland connectivity patterns and magnitudes in other wetlandscape settings. ©2019.

In this mini-review, the most recently developed broadband near-infrared phosphors activated by Cr3+ are listed and classified according to their major chemical element constituents. In addition to the luminescence mechanism of Cr3+, the association between the number of crystallographic sites and spectral distribution of near-infrared light is mainly reviewed with the example of known near-infrared phosphors, which may be helpful in exploring future broadband near-infrared phosphors.

abstract={Indian biodiversity is a hub for medicinal plants. Extensive research has been carried out to select plants with numerous properties which can be used for human welfare. Present research is about Cymbopogon citratus, an economically valuable medicinal plant. In this study Cymbopogon citratus was elected as a subject plant over the five selected plants (Azadirachta indica, Plumeria obtuse, Sapindus mukorossi, Capsicum annuum and Phyllanthus emblica) on the basis of antibacterial effect against dominating pathogenic species of gram positive (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis) and gram negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli) bacteria. Further, bioactive agents behind antibacterial potential of Cymbopogon citratus was analyzed using analytical method (Phyto-chemical, FTIR, NMR and GC-MS). Due to the broad antimicrobial spectrum, silver nanoparticles have turned into a noteworthy decision for the improvement of new medication. Therefore, this investigation further elaborated in the development of Cymbopogon citratus silver nano-particles (CNPs). Antibacterial potential of CNPs examine in a range of C25-C150 (μg/ml) through minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) where, C25 (μg/ml) concentration of CNPs were recorded as the MIC for all bacterial species and C25 (μg/ml) and C50 (μg/ml) noted as the MBC for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis, respectively. In agar disk diffusion assay of CNPs, maximum diameter of zone of inhibition was observed for C150 (μg/ml) concentration Bacillus cereus (20.12 ± 0.42), Bacillus licheniformis (22.34 ± 0.4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35.23 ± 0.46) and Escherichia coli (31.87 ± 0.24). Involvement of bioactive component as a reducing and capping agent can be confirmed through FTIR spectrum of CNPs. Moreover XRD, EDXRF and SEM showed crystalline and cuboidal nature of CNPs with ∼35 nm sizes. Prominently, cytotoxic analysis was conducted to understand the toxic effect of CNPs. This research highlights the potential of CNPs due to the bioactive components present in Cymbopogon citratus extract: Polyphenols (phenol; 1584.56 ± 16.32 mg/L, Flavanoids) and mixture of terpenoids (Citral, Myrcene, Farnesol, β-myrcene and β-Pinene). © 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

We investigated food and water intake, body mass, blood pressure, glucose tolerance, plasma and liver biochemistry, hepatic protein and gene expression. There were no changes in body mass, food intake and glucose tolerance among the groups. The F group presented increased water intake and blood pressure associated with hepatic steatosis and elevated de novo lipogenesis, beta-oxidation, mitochondrial biogenesis and inflammation in the liver. Surprisingly, the C-MCT group also showed hepatic steatosis and inflammation in the liver, and the F-MCT group had no exacerbations of fructose-induced abnormalities, showing marked hepatic steatosis, lipogenesis de novo and hepatic inflammation. The MCT oil groups also presented increased beta-oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis. In conclusion, MCT oil showed detrimental hepatic effects and should be used with caution, especially in the presence of hepatic alterations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Observations of iodine oxide (IO) were made in the Indian Ocean and the Southern Ocean marine boundary layer (MBL) during the 8th Indian Southern Ocean Expedition. IO was observed almost ubiquitously in the open ocean with larger mixing ratios south of the Polar Front (PF). Contrary to previous reports, IO was not positively correlated to sea surface temperature (SST)/salinity, or negatively to chlorophyll a. Over the whole expedition, SST showed a weak negative correlation with respect to IO while chl a was positively correlated. North of the PF, chl a showed a strong positive correlation with IO. The computed HOI and I2 fluxes do not show any significant correlation with atmospheric IO. Simulations with the global CAM-Chem model show a reasonably good agreement with observations north of the PF but the model fails to reproduce the elevated IO south of the PF indicating that the current emission parametrizations are not sufficient to explain iodine chemistry in the Southern Indian Ocean. © 2019 The Author(s)},

An overview of the absorption and emission properties of Dy3+-doped crystalline lattices is presented, based on the inspection of the available literature as well as on experimental measurements. Systematic behaviors have been related to the host composition in the frame of the Judd-Ofelt approach, and the development of criteria for predicting the luminescence characteristics of new materials is discussed. Some open problems have been pointed out, evidencing weaknesses of the theoretical model still waiting for solution. Suggestions for further experimental projects are finally proposed. © 2019},

abstract={This article discusses applications of Bayesian machine learning for quantum molecular dynamics. One particular formulation of quantum dynamics advocated here is in the form of a machine learning simulator of the Schrödinger equation. If combined with the Bayesian statistics, such a simulator allows one to obtain not only the quantum predictions but also the error bars of the dynamical results associated with uncertainties of inputs (such as the potential energy surface or non-adiabatic couplings) into the nuclear Schrödinger equation. Instead of viewing atoms as undergoing dynamics on a given potential energy surface, Bayesian machine learning allows one to formulate the problem as the Schrödinger equation with a non-parametric distribution of potential energy surfaces that becomes conditioned by the desired dynamical properties (such as the experimental measurements). Machine learning models of the Schrödinger equation solutions can identify the sensitivity of the dynamical properties to different parts of the potential surface, the collision energy, angular momentum, external field parameters and basis sets used for the calculations. This can be used to inform the design of efficient quantum dynamics calculations. Machine learning models can also be used to correlate rigorous results with approximate calculations, providing accurate interpolation of exact results. Finally, there is evidence that it is possible to build Bayesian machine learning models capable of physically extrapolating the solutions of the Schrödinger equation. This is particularly valuable as such models could complement common discovery tools to explore physical properties at Hamiltonian parameters not accessible by rigorous quantum calculations or experiments, and potentially be used to accelerate the numerical integration of the nuclear Schrödinger equation. © the Owner Societies.},

abstract={Effective management of dairy manure is important to minimize N losses from cropping systems, maximize profitability, and enhance environmental sustainability. The objectives of this study were (i) to calibrate and validate the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model using measurements of silage corn (Zea mays L.) biomass, N uptake, soil temperature, tile drain flow, NO3− leaching, N2O emissions, and soil mineral N in eastern Canada, and (ii) to investigate the long-term impacts of manure management under climate variability. The treatments investigated included a zero-fertilizer control, inorganic fertilizer, and dairy manure amendments (raw and digested). The DNDC model overall demonstrated statistically “good” performance when simulating silage corn yield and N uptake based on normalized RMSE (nRMSE) &lt; 10%, index of agreement (d) &gt; 0.9, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) &gt; 0.5. In addition, DNDC, with its inclusion of a tile drainage mechanism, demonstrated “good” predictions for cumulative drainage (nRMSE &lt; 20%, d &gt; 0.8, and NSE &gt; 0.5). The model did, however, underestimate daily drainage flux during spring thaw for both organic and inorganic amendments. This was attributed to an underestimation of soil temperature and soil water under frequent soil freezing and thawing during the 2013-2014 overwinter period. Long-term simulations under climate variability indicated that spring applied manure resulted in less NO3− leaching and N2O emissions than fall application when manure rates were managed based on crop N requirements. Overall, this study helped highlight the challenges in discerning the short-term climate interactions on fertilizer-induced N losses compared with the long-term dynamics under climate variability. © 2019 The Author(s) and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada.},

abstract={Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) has accelerated novel discoveries across multiple disciplines including medicine. Clinical medicine suffers from a lack of AI-based applications, potentially due to lack of awareness of AI methodology. Future collaboration between computer scientists and clinicians is critical to maximize the benefits of transformative technology in this field for patients. To illustrate, we describe AI-based advances in the diagnosis and management of gliomas, the most common primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancy. Methods: Presented is a succinct description of foundational concepts of AI approaches and their relevance to clinical medicine, geared toward clinicians without computer science backgrounds. We also review novel AI approaches in the diagnosis and management of glioma. Results: Novel AI approaches in gliomas have been developed to predict the grading and genomics from imaging, automate the diagnosis from histopathology, and provide insight into prognosis. Conclusion: Novel AI approaches offer acceptable performance in gliomas. Further investigation is necessary to improve the methodology and determine the full clinical utility of these novel approaches. © 2019 Sotoudeh, Shafaat, Bernstock, Brooks, Elsayed, Chen, Szerip, Chagoya, Gessler, Sotoudeh, Shafaat and Friedman.},

The structure and composition of the PNNNP-Ru pincer MOFs have been determined using synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction, solid-and solution-state NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Reaction of 2 with KOtBu results in deprotonation of an NH group of the PNNNP-RuCl(CO)2 linkers. Subsequent treatment with Me3NO removes a Ru-coordinated CO ligand, generating 2-b, which proved to be a recyclable catalyst for the hydrosilylation of aryl aldehydes with Et3SiH. A similar postsynthetic treatment of 1 and 3 does not generate active catalysts, highlighting the importance of precatalyst design and activation. A homogeneous analogue of 2-b also showed inferior catalytic performance, demonstrating the benefit of catalyst immobilization. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Predicting gene functions from genome sequence alone has been difficult, and the functions of a large fraction of plant genes remain unknown. However, leveraging the vast amount of currently available gene expression data has the potential to facilitate our understanding of plant gene functions, especially in determining complex traits. Gene coexpression networks—created by integrating multiple expression datasets—connect genes with similar patterns of expression across multiple conditions. Dense gene communities in such networks, commonly referred to as modules, often indicate that the member genes are functionally related. As such, these modules serve as tools for generating new testable hypotheses, including the prediction of gene function and importance. Recently, we have seen a paradigm shift from the traditional “global” to more defined, context-specific coexpression networks. Such coexpression networks imply genetic correlations in specific biological contexts such as during development or in response to a stress. In this short review, we highlight a few recent studies that attempt to fill the large gaps in our knowledge about cellular functions of plant genes using context-specific coexpression networks. © 2019 Gupta C and Pereira A.},

abstract={Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease that kills as many Americans as breast cancer each year. This study investigated whether lung function decline and survival associates with adaptive immunity in patients with IPF, specifically the expression of checkpoint molecules ICOS, CD28 and PD-1 on circulating CD4 T cells. Clinical data, blood samples and pulmonary function tests were collected prospectively and longitudinally from 59 patients with IPF over a study period of 5 years. Patients were followed until death, lung transplantation, or study end, and cell surface expression of CD45RO, CD28, ICOS, and PD-1 was measured on CD4 T cells via flow cytometry. Repeated measures of ICOS and CD28 on CD4 T cells revealed significant associations between declining ICOS and CD28 expression, and declining lung function parameters FVC and DLCO, independent of age, sex, race, smoking history, or immunosuppressant use. Strikingly, patients in the highest quintile of ICOS at study entry had markedly improved survival, while those with low CD28 fared poorly. No change in PD-1 expression was found. Analysis of ICOS and CD28 from the first blood draw identified three populations of IPF patients; those at high risk for early death, those with intermediate risk, and those at low risk. These results highlight the role of T cell mediated immunity in IPF survival, finding the assessment of two T cell stimulatory checkpoint molecules, CD28 and ICOS, was sufficient to discriminate three distinct survival trajectories over 5 years of patient follow up. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Eu3+ activated phosphors have been a subject of scientific investigation for more than 100 years. Various host materials have been employed, among which molybdate hosts play an important role. They offer an array of advantageous properties such as high critical activator concentrations, facile solid state synthesis and excitation via the Mo6+/O2− charge transfer (CT) transition. This review paper discusses the basics of Eu3+ luminescence and presents the most important properties and synthesis conditions of various Eu3+ activated molybdates. Furthermore, relations between the crystallographic structure of the host and the optical properties of Eu3+ are shown. The point symmetry of the Eu3+ doping site can be determined from specific features of the Eu3+ emission spectrum and the number of crystallographic sites can be estimated. The concept of optical basicity is discussed in regard to the spectral position of the Mo6+/O2− charge transfer band. The influence of the CT band on the thermal quenching properties and consequently the photoluminescence efficiency of Eu3+ is investigated. Disadvantages of molybdates as phosphor host materials are discussed as well, such as the formation of Mo5+ defect states. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Cellular components of the tumour microenvironment (TME) are recognized to regulate the hallmarks of cancers including tumour proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis, as well as chemotherapeutic resistance. The linkage between miRNA, TME, and the development of the hallmarks of cancer makes miRNA-mediated regulation of TME a potential therapeutic strategy to complement current cancer therapies. Despite significant advances in cancer therapy, lung cancer remains the deadliest form of cancer among males in the world and has overtaken breast cancer as the most fatal cancer among females in more developed countries. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop more effective treatments for NSCLC, which is the most common type of lung cancer. Hence, this review will focus on current literature pertaining to antitumour or protumourigenic effects elicited by nonmalignant stromal cells of TME in NSCLC through miRNA regulation as well as current status and future prospects of miRNAs as therapeutic agents or targets to regulate TME in NSCLC. © 2019 Sook Shien Lee and Yoke Kqueen Cheah.},

abstract={The absorption and luminescence properties (centroid shift and crystal field splitting of 5d orbitals) of Ce3+-doped garnets are summarized from the viewpoints of chemical composition (electron negativity and optical basicity) and the local crystal structure of the Ce3+ ion (bond length and distortion). Clear trends exist between (1) the centroid shift of 5d energy (εc) and the optical basicity of the host garnets and between (2) the crystal field splitting of the lowest 5d1-5d2 levels (Δ12) and a new distortion parameter obtained from the crystal structure data. The data of quantum yield and quenching temperatures of Ce3+-doped garnets are also considered, indicating the thermal ionization process as the main mechanisms for the quenching process. Based on our recent experimental results, to prove the thermal ionization process, the principle and the most important features of the photocurrent excitation (PCE) and thermoluminescence excitation (TLE) spectra measurements are summarized. Finally, a general trend for the quenching temperature of Ce3+ luminescence in the garnets is discussed in terms of the energy gap between the lowest 5d1 level and the conduction band bottom obtained from the vacuum referred binding energy (VRBE) diagram. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Nardostachys chinensis Batalin (Valerianaceae) has been widely used in different traditional systems of medicine, including Islamic, Ayurvedic, Chinese, and Korean folk medicine. It has been used in traditional medicine as a tranquilizer, hepatotonic, cardiotonic, diuretic, and analgesic. Preliminary in vitro and in vivo studies have provided valuable scientific evidence for its traditional uses. This review aims to summarize reported traditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacological potential of N. chinensis while identifying potential areas of further research of plant. The review comprises literature pertaining to the pharmacological potential and phytochemistry of N. chinensis using worldwide accepted scientific databases via electronic search (Elsevier, Google Scholar, Pub Med, Scopus, Springer, Wiley online library). Moreover, data from ethno botanical text books available in library and electronic search were also included. The Plant List and Kew Herbarium Catalogue databases were used to authenticate the scientific name. Different pharmacological experiments in many in vitro and in vivo models have proved the potential of N. chinensis, namely, anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, antibacterial, antihypertensive, antifungal, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, aldose reductase inhibition, and antioxidant activities. The plant contains sesquiterpenenes of various varieties including aristolane, guaiane, and nardosinane types. Moreover, it also contains coumarins, phenols, lignans, neolignans, and glycosides. Reported activities suggested that there may be pharmacological potential for developing N. chinensis as a drug for infections, hypertension, cardiac diseases, Alzheimer's disease, insomnia, epilepsy, cancer, gastric, and liver diseases. More toxicological studies should be performed that will aid the progress to clinical trial studies of N. chinensis. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Many animals can change the size, shape, texture and color of their regenerated coats in response to different ages, sexes, or seasonal environmental changes. Here, we propose that the feather core branching morphogenesis module can be regulated by sex hormones or other environmental factors to change feather forms, textures or colors, thus generating a large spectrum of complexity for adaptation. We use sexual dimorphisms of the chicken to explore the role of hormones. A long-standing question is whether the sex-dependent feather morphologies are autonomously controlled by the male or female cell types, or extrinsically controlled and reversible. We have recently identified core feather branching molecular modules which control the anterior-posterior (bone morphogenetic orotein [BMP], Wnt gradient), medio-lateral (Retinoic signaling, Gremlin), and proximo-distal (Sprouty, BMP) patterning of feathers. We hypothesize that morpho-regulation, through quantitative modulation of existing parameters, can act on core branching modules to topologically tune the dimension of each parameter during morphogenesis and regeneration. Here, we explore the involvement of hormones in generating sexual dimorphisms using exogenously delivered hormones. Our strategy is to mimic male androgen levels by applying exogenous dihydrotestosterone and aromatase inhibitors to adult females and to mimic female estradiol levels by injecting exogenous estradiol to adult males. We also examine differentially expressed genes in the feathers of wildtype male and female chickens to identify potential downstream modifiers of feather morphogenesis. The data show male and female feather morphology and their color patterns can be modified extrinsically through molting and resetting the stem cell niche during regeneration. © 2018 Japanese Society of Developmental Biologists},

abstract={Bronchial asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized, in a percentage of patients, as an eosinophilic inflammation of the airways. Eosinophils are recognized as a proinflammatory granulocyte playing a major role in the T2-high phenotype, which includes severe eosinophilic asthma. Eosinophilic asthma represents the majority of the phenotypic variants clinically characterized by severity and frequent exacerbations. For patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, monoclonal antibodies are used as add-on treatments. Among them, in addition to anti-immunoglobulin E therapy, biologic agents directed toward the interleukin (IL)-5/IL-5Rα axis and, thus, interfering with the pathologic functions of eosinophils, are now available. Unlike the other anti‒IL-5 monoclonal antibodies which exert an indirect effect on eosinophils, benralizumab, an afucosylated IgG1 kappa antibody directed against the α subunit of IL-5R, directly depletes eosinophils and their associated bone marrow progenitor cells through induction of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, through recruitment of natural killer cells. This article reviews the role of eosinophils in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma and discusses the potential advantageous biologic effects of benralizumab in comparison with other monoclonal antibodies targeting the IL-5 ligand. © 2019},

abstract={The historic emissions of polar micropollutants in a natural drinking water source were investigated by nontarget screening with high-resolution mass spectrometry and open cheminformatics tools. The study area consisted of a riverbank filtration transect fed by the river Lek, a branch of the lower Rhine, and exhibiting up to 60-year travel time. More than 18,000 profiles were detected. Hierarchical clustering revealed that 43% of the 15 most populated clusters were characterized by intensity trends with maxima in the 1990s, reflecting intensified human activities, wastewater treatment plant upgrades and regulation in the Rhine riparian countries. Tentative structure annotation was performed using automated in silico fragmentation. Candidate structures retrieved from ChemSpider were scored based on the fit of the in silico fragments to the experimental tandem mass spectra, similarity to openly accessible accurate mass spectra, associated metadata, and presence in a suspect list. Sixty-seven unique structures (72 over both ionization modes) were tentatively identified, 25 of which were confirmed and included contaminants so far unknown to occur in bank filtrate or in natural waters at all, such as tetramethylsulfamide. This study demonstrates that many classes of hydrophilic organics enter riverbank filtration systems, persisting and migrating for decades if biogeochemical conditions are stable. © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

Natural language processing (NLP) was used to model topics across the corpus and to identify keywords within surgical subspecialties. ML applications were heterogeneous. The densest cluster of studies focused on preoperative evaluation, planning, and outcome prediction in spine surgery. The main algorithms applied were NN, LR, and SVM. Input and output features varied widely and were listed to facilitate future research. The accuracy (F(2,19) = 6.56, p &lt; 0.01) and specificity (F(2,16) = 5.57, p &lt; 0.01) of NN, LR, and SVM differed significantly. NN algorithms demonstrated significantly higher accuracy than LR. SVM demonstrated significantly higher specificity than LR. We found no significant difference between NN, LR, and SVM AUC and sensitivity. NLP topic modeling reached maximum coherence at seven topics, which were defined by modeling approach, surgery type, and pathology themes. Keywords captured research foci within surgical domains. ML technology accurately predicts outcomes and facilitates clinical decision-making in neurosurgery. NNs frequently outperformed other algorithms on supervised learning tasks. This study identified gaps in the literature and opportunities for future neurosurgical ML research. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Background: There are similar risk factors for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. It is recognized that COPD is common in patients with lung cancer. However, the prevalence of lung cancer in the COPD population remains unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence of lung cancer in COPD. Methods: Four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL) examining the prevalence of lung cancer in COPD were searched for studies published between 1997 and 2018. Meta-analysis with a random effects model was used to calculate pooled prevalence for the included studies. A sub-group analysis was performed for studies of similar population and design. Odds ratios were calculated for case-control studies. Results: Twenty-one studies that examined the prevalence of lung cancer in a population of 1,682,908 individuals with COPD were included. The pooled prevalence for lung cancer in COPD was 2.79% (95% CI: 1.88–3.88). Results are confounded by significant heterogeneity among studies (Q = 12,622, I 2 = 100%), particularly related to the large variation in sample size and study design. Seven studies compared lung cancer prevalence in COPD to controls without COPD with an odds ratio of 6.35 (95% CI: 3.98–10.15). Conclusions: Although the prevalence of lung cancer in individuals with COPD is low, it is greater than the prevalence of lung cancer in the general population. Knowledge of the co-occurrence of lung cancer in COPD will inform the screening of lung cancer for patients who have COPD. © 2019},

abstract={Controversial, sensational and often contradictory scientific reports have triggered active debates over the biological effects of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) in literature and mass media the last few decades. This could lead to confusion and distraction, subsequently hampering the development of a univocal conclusion on the real hazards caused by EMFs on humans. For example, there are lots of publications indicating that EMF can induce apoptosis and DNA strand-breaks in cells. On the other hand, these effects could rather be beneficial, in that they could be effectively harnessed for treatment of various disorders, including cancer. This review discusses and analyzes the results of various in vitro, in vivo and epidemiological studies on the effects of non-ionizing EMFs on cells and organs, including the consequences of exposure to the low and high frequencies EM spectrum. Emphasis is laid on the analysis of recent data on the role of EMF in the induction of oxidative stress and DNA damage. Additionally, the impact of EMF on the reproductive system has been discussed, as well as the relationship between EM radiation and blood cancer. Apart from adverse effects, the therapeutic potential of EMFs for clinical use in different pathologies is also highlighted. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain-containing proteins are critical to homeostatic regulatory networks that mediate responsiveness to environmental change. PAS domains are multifunctional structural motifs that allow protein-protein interactions amongst family members, typically forming heterodimeric transcription factors to affect the transcription of target genes. Prototypical PAS domain-dependent pathways include the circadian clock network and metabolic regulation of the xenobiotic response through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Both pathways are increasingly linked to health, and alteration in their function contributes to development of disease. The AhR demonstrates promiscuity in ligand binding and selectivity during heterodimer formation, which allows varied combinations of protein-protein interactions with other Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain-containing proteins and crosstalk amongst signalling pathways, including the molecular clockworks. AhR and the circadian signalling pathways are highly integrated and reciprocally regulated. AhR exhibits a rhythmic expression and time-dependent sensitivity to activation by AhR agonists. Conversely, AhR influences amplitude and phase of rhythms in circadian clock genes, hormones, and behaviour. Understanding the molecular interactions between AhR and the clock provides insight into physiological regulation of rhythmic processes and provides an innovative approach to development of therapeutics. © 2019 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

One property is the energy resolution for the detection of γ-rays, and during past 20 years we witnessed enormous progress. The state of the art resolution for the detection of 662 keV γ photons was 5–6% at the end of the 20th century, and today scintillators with 2.2% resolution are commercially available. This work will provide a review on the development of high resolution chloride, bromide, and iodide based scintillators that occurred since the discovery of the LaCl3:Ce3+ scintillator in 2000. Bandgap engineering and co-doping to eliminate afterglow or to improve proportionality have become new tools in optimizing scintillator performance.

abstract={Phenolic compounds are an important class of plant secondary metabolites which play crucial physiological roles throughout the plant life cycle. Phenolics are produced under optimal and suboptimal conditions in plants and play key roles in developmental processes like cell division, hormonal regulation, photosynthetic activity, nutrient mineralization, and reproduction. Plants exhibit increased synthesis of polyphenols such as phenolic acids and flavonoids under abiotic stress conditions, which help the plant to cope with environmental constraints. Phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway is activated under abiotic stress conditions (drought, heavy metal, salinity, high/low temperature, and ultraviolet radiations) resulting in accumulation of various phenolic compounds which, among other roles, have the potential to scavenge harmful reactive oxygen species. Deepening the research focuses on the phenolic responses to abiotic stress is of great interest for the scientific community. In the present article, we discuss the biochemical and molecular mechanisms related to the activation of phenylpropanoid metabolism and we describe phenolic-mediated stress tolerance in plants. An attempt has been made to provide updated and brand-new information about the response of phenolics under a challenging environment. © 2019 MDPI AG. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Given their sessile nature, plants continuously face unfavorable conditions throughout their life cycle, including water scarcity, extreme temperatures and soil pollution. Among all, metal(loid)s are one of the main classes of contaminants worldwide, posing a serious threat to plant growth and development. When in excess, metals which include both essential and non-essential elements, quickly become phytotoxic, inducing the occurrence of oxidative stress. In this way, in order to ensure food production and safety, attempts to enhance plant tolerance to metal(loid)s are urgently needed. Nitric oxide (NO) is recognized as a signaling molecule, highly involved in multiple physiological events, like the response of plants to abiotic stress. Thus, substantial efforts have been made to assess NO potential in alleviating metal-induced oxidative stress in plants. In this review, an updated overview of NO-mediated protection against metal toxicity is provided. After carefully reviewing NO biosynthetic pathways, focus was given to the interaction between NO and the redox homeostasis followed by photosynthetic performance of plants under metal excess. © 2019 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society},

abstract={Biodegradable magnesium-based implants are the subject of a great deal of research for different orthopedic and vascular applications. The targeted design and properties depend on the specific medical function and location in the body. Development of the biomaterial requires a comprehensive understanding of the biological interaction between the implant and the host tissue, as well as of the behavior in the physiological environment in vivo. Research into and the development of innovative magnesium implants entails interdisciplinary research efforts and communication between materials science, bioscience, and medical experts. The present study provides a transparent planning and communication tool for market-oriented implant development processes. The objective was to identify medical needs at an early stage of the development process and to quantify the importance of the engineering characteristics of different research fields that cater to specific implant requirements. The method is demonstrated by the performance of a survey-based conjoint analysis, which was integrated into a quality function deployment approach. Twenty-seven medical professionals and 29 biomaterial scientists assessed the importance of identified medical requirements, whereby the control of mechanical integrity and degradation along with nontoxicity and nonimmunogenicity showed the highest number of preferences. The evaluation of implant options by 31 experts indicated that the engineering characteristic with the highest importance was the condition and sterilization of the surface. These values can be used to set priorities in strategic decisions. Research trials can be aligned to medical preferences, ensuring high product quality and an effective development process. This is the first paper to report on the application of conjoint-based quality function deployment in biomaterial research. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Lead halide perovskites (LHP) have been intensively studied over the past years due to their attractive optical electronic and optoelectronic properties, including narrow band emission covering whole visible region, defect tolerance, and near-unity luminescence quantum yield, which makes them to be promising materials for next generation lighting and display. However, the poor stability of LHP remains the key obstacle restricting their practical applications. This review summarizes the factors which influences the stability of the structure and luminescence properties of LHP, such as the light, heat, humidity and gases. Furthermore, the recent strategies for improving the stability are highlighted at the current state of the art. On the basis of the function mechanism, these methods can be classified into four types: compositional engineering, waterproof materials encapsulation, embedded in heterogeneous crystals, and super-hydrophobic structure, which will be as a guide to overcome the limitations of LHP and impel the development of their practical application. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The devastating Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa in 2013–2016 has flagged the need for the timely development of vaccines for high-threat pathogens. To be better prepared for new epidemics, the WHO has compiled a list of priority pathogens that are likely to cause future outbreaks and for which R&D efforts are, therefore, paramount (R&D Blueprint: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.who.int_blueprint_priority-2Ddiseases_en_&d=DwIGaQ&c=sJ6xIWYx-zLMB3EPkvcnVg&r=hPRQO-QHqXhD8p9F43Mezw&m=5Ygbn-ChjRk5z0uQS3lymjWAtJDFin15cLna7hnk9fc&s=FAAyjEYp1zHnxrKJFV26TukZx1odQV1KTJkMIM0ch6I&e= ). To this end, the detailed characterization of vaccine platforms is needed. The vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has been established as a robust vaccine vector backbone for infectious diseases for well over a decade. The recent clinical trials testing the vaccine candidate VSV-EBOV against EBOV disease now have added a substantial amount of clinical data and suggest VSV to be an ideal vaccine vector candidate for outbreak pathogens. In this review, we discuss insights gained from the clinical VSV-EBOV vaccine trials as well as from animal studies investigating vaccine candidates for Blueprint pathogens. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

abstract={Exosomes are small membrane vesicles (ranging from 30 nm to 150 nm), secreted by different cell types upon fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVB) to the cell plasma membrane under a variety of normal and pathological conditions. Through transferring their cargos such as proteins, lipids and nucleic acids from donor cells to recipient cells, exosomes play a crucial role in cell-to-cell communication. Due to their presence in most body fluids (such as blood, breast milk, saliva, urine, bile, pancreatic juice, cerebrospinal and peritoneal fluids), and their role in carrying bioactive molecules from the cells of origin, exosomes have attracted great interest in their diagnostic and prognostic value for various diseases and therapeutic approaches. Although a large body of literature has documented the importance of exosomes over the past decade, there is no article systematically summarizing protein markers of exosome from different resources and the antibodies that are suited to characterize exosomes. In this review, we briefly summarize the exosome marker proteins, exosomal biomarkers for different diseases, and the antibodies suitable for different bio-resources exosomes characterization. © 2019, © 2019 National Society for Histotechnology.},

abstract={Stroke is the second leading cause of death globally and represents a major cause of devastating long-term disability. Despite sustained efforts to develop clinically effective neuroprotective therapies, presently there is no clinically available neuroprotective agent for stroke. As a central mediator of neurodamaging events in stroke, mitochondria are recognised as a critical neuroprotective target, and as such, provide a focus for developing mitochondrial-targeted therapeutics. In recent years, cationic arginine-rich peptides (CARPs) have been identified as a novel class of neuroprotective agent with several demonstrated mechanisms of action, including their ability to target mitochondria and exert positive effects on the organelle. This review provides an overview on neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction in ischaemic stroke pathophysiology and highlights the potential beneficial effects of CARPs on mitochondria in the ischaemic brain following stroke. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

The aim of this study was to isolated and identified the exopolysaccharide-producing endophytic fungi from leaf midrib of oil palm. Leaf midrib was collected from oil palm in Kuala Bekala Plantation in Medan, Indonesia. Endophytic fungal isolates were characterized morphologically and then identified molecularly by amplification of ITS region of ribosomal RNA. Endophytic fungi of exopolysaccharides-producing were selected by cultivated on mineral medium with sucrose as carbon and NaNO 3 as nitrogen sources. Exopolysaccharides were collected, purified and characterized the FTIR spectrum. The isolation results obtained 14 isolates of fungal endophytes; eleven isolates were characterized as Ascomycetes, and 3 isolates as Basidiomycetes. Based on molecular identification were founded eight of Genera; two Genera in Basidiomycetes. (Schizophyllum and Psathyrella) and 6 Genera in Ascomycetes (Pestalotiopsis, Phyllosticta, Curvularia, Nectria, Diaporthe and Nigrospora). The dominant species of Ascomycetes group were genus Pestalotiopsis. Almost all of fungal endophytes were as exopolysaccharides producer strains. The major functional groups of the exopolysaccharides produced by 11 species of endophytic fungi of oil palm were -OH, -CH, -C = C, and C-O-C groups. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The fungi were isolated from local forest Gunung Barus North Sumatera. Six isolates of decolorizing fungi cultivated on basal medium and basal medium enriched with wastewater containing dyes for the production of exopolysaccharide. The isolates were then cultivated on basal medium with and without glucose content. Results showed that only one isolate ZN03 of six tested isolates produced the exopolysaccharide both in basal medium and basal medium enriched with wastewater containing dyes. Isolate ZN03 showed the highest decolorization activity (58.5%) among other fungi. Then the production of exopolysaccharide was found only in culture supplemented with glucose. The exopolysaccharide produced by ZN03 absorbed dyes containing in wastewater and changed its color from white to dark brown. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Groundwater contamination by pathogenic bacteria present in land-applied manure poses a threat to public health. In cold climate regions, surface soil layers experience repeated temperature fluctuations around the freezing point known as freeze-thaw (FT) cycles. With global climate change, annual soil FT cycles have increased, and this trend is expected to continue. It is therefore of interest to understand how FT cycles impact soil microbial communities. This study investigates the influence of FT cycles on the growth, culturability, biofilm formation, and virulence of the bacterial opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a ubiquitous bacterium found in soil and water, responsible for infections in immunocompromised hosts. Our findings demonstrate that exposure to FT had no significant effect on growth or culturability of the bacteria. However, FT treatment significantly increased biofilm formation and delayed the onset of swimming motility, factors that are important for the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa. An in vivo study using a chronic infection model revealed an increase in the virulence of P. aeruginosa after FT exposure. These results suggest that the impact of climate change on natural FT cycles may be affecting the ecology of soil-borne pathogens and host-pathogen interactions in unexpected ways. © 2018 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={It was proposed that most biological processes are performed by different protein complexes. In contrast to individual proteins and enzymes, their complexes usually have other biological functions, and their formation may be important system process for the expansion of diversity and biological functions of different molecules. Identification and characterization of embryonic components including proteins and their multiprotein complexes seem to be very important for an understanding of embryo function. We have isolated and analyzed for the first time a very stable multiprotein complex (SPC; approximately 1100 kDa) from the soluble fraction of extracts of the sea urchin embryos. By fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) gel filtration the SPC was well separated from other extract proteins. Stable multiprotein complex is stable in different drastic conditions but dissociates moderately in the presence of 8M urea + 1.0M NaCl. According to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis data, this complex contains many major, moderate and minor proteins with molecular masses from 10 to 95 kDa. The SPC was destroyed by 8M urea or SDS, and its components were separated using thin layer chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and reverse phase chromatography. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry of partially dissociated SPC, it was shown that the complex contains not only proteins (10-95 kDa) but also few dozens of peptides with molecular masses from 2 to 9.5 kDa. Short peptides form very strong complexes, which at the treatment of SPC with urea or SDS can be partially break down into smaller complexes having different peptide compositions. Reverse phase chromatography of these complexes after all type of abovementioned chromatographies led to detection from 6 to 11 distinct peaks corresponding to new complexes containing up to a few dozens of peptides. The SPCs possess alkaline phosphatase activity. Progress in the study of embryos protein complexes can help to understand their biological functions. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Prediction of bathing water quality is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Union (EU) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and is an established element in bathing water management designed to protect public health. Most commonly, historical regulatory compliance data are used for model calibration and provide the dependent variable for modelling. Independent (or predictor) variables (e.g. rainfall, river flow and received irradiance) measured over some antecedent period are used to deliver prediction of the faecal indicator concentration measured on the day of the regulatory sample collection. The implied linked assumptions of this approach are, therefore, that; (i) the independent variables accurately predict the bathing-day water quality; which is (ii) accurately characterized by the single regulatory sample. Assumption (ii) will not be the case where significant within-day variability in water quality is evident. This study built a detailed record of water quality change through 60 days at a UK coastal bathing water in 2011 using half-hourly samples each subjected to triplicate filtration designed to enhance enumeration precision. On average, the mean daily variation in FIO concentrations exceeded 1 log10 order, with the largest daily variations exceeding 2 log10 orders. Significant diurnality was observed at this bathing water, which would determine its EU Directive compliance category if the regulatory samples were collected at the same time each day. A sampling programme of this intensity has not been reported elsewhere to date and, if this pattern is proven to be characteristic of other bathing waters world-wide, it has significance for: (a) the design of regulatory sampling programmes; (b) the use of historical data to assess compliance, which often comprises a single sample taken at the compliance point on a regular, often weekly, basis; and (c) the use of regulatory compliance data to build predictive models of water quality. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={Vanadate, a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor which elicits insulin-like effects, has previously been shown to inhibit expression of the insulin receptor gene at the transcriptional level in rat hepatoma cells. In an attempt to identify the DNA sequence and transcription factors potentially involved in this effect, a fragment of the proximal 5′flanking region of the IR gene (−1143/−252 upstream the ATG codon) has been cloned and functionally characterized. RNase protection allowed the identification of several transcription start sites in the conserved region of the gene, among which two major sites at −455 and −396. Upon fusion to the luciferase gene and transient transfection into hepatoma cells, the −1143/−252 fragment showed promoter activity. This was unaffected by deletion of the −1143/−761 sequence, but markedly decreased (90%) by additional deletion of the −760/−465 sequence. Treatment of hepatoma cells with vanadate led to a dose-dependent decrease in promoter activity of the 1143/−252, −760/−252 and −464/−252 constructs (change relative to untreated cells, 40, 55 and 23% at 125 μM, and 70, 85 and 62% at 250 μM, respectively). These data suggest that although the entire DNA sequence upstream the transcription start sites is probably involved in vanadate-induced inhibition, the short sequence downstream of position −464 and is sufficient for inhibition. Potential targets of vanadate are the transcription factors FoxO1 and HMGA1, two downstream targets of the insulin signaling pathway which have been shown to mediate the inhibitory effect of insulin on IR gene expression. © 2018},

abstract={Ion channels are located in plasma membranes as well as on mitochondrial, lysosomal, and endoplasmic reticulum membranes. They play a critical role in physiology and drug targeting. It is particularly challenging to measure the current mediated by ion channels in the lysosomal and the endoplasmic reticulum membranes using the conventional patch clamp method. In this study, we show that our proposed device is applicable for an electrophysiological measurement of various types of ion channel in plasma and organelle membranes. We designed an on-chip device that can form multiple electrical contacts with a measurement system when placed on a mount system. Using crude cell membranes containing ion channels extracted from cultured cells without detergents, we detected open/close signals of the hERG, TRPV1, and NMDA channels on plasma membranes, those of the TRPML1 channels on lysosomal membranes, and open/close signals of the RyR channels on SR membranes. This method will provide a highly versatile drug screening system for ion channels expressed by various cell membranes, including plasma, SR, mitochondrial, Golgi, and lysosomal membranes. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={Origanum vulgare commonly known as oregano belongs to mint family (Laminaceae), and native to temperate western and mediterranean region. In our present study, we have identified the bio-active principles of oregano essential oil (EO) and evaluated its apoptotic effects against human stomach cancer cell lines (AGS). The EO altered colony forming characteristics of cancer cell, migration ability of cancer cell and thus prevented cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, to evaluate the molecular mechanism involved in cancer cell death, we studied the genes that are involved in fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis pathway including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), Acetyl CoA synthase (ACC), sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SPREPB1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) respectively. The pathway genes such as HMGCR, ACC, SPREPB1 and FASN decreased in transcript profile and protein accumulation resulting in the inhibition of cell growth. The increase of BAX expression and downregulation of BCL2 expression indicated that oregano EO induced mitochondrial mediated apoptosis. In addition, the cancer cell undergone apoptosis was also confirmed by Hoechst, PI staining and DNA fragmentation. The present study finds rationale to use the oregano EO for stomach cancer treatments in traditional medicinal practice. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Current groundwater treatment facilities, mostly relying on aeration-filtration configurations, aim at the removal of iron (Fe), ammonia (NH4+) and manganese (Mn). However, recently water companies expressed the ambition to also reduce arsenic (As) concentrations in these rapid sand filters. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the Fe oxidation state entering a biological filter bed on As removal. By varying supernatant water level, either Fe(II) or Fe(III) in the form of hydrous ferric oxides (HFO) could be stimulated to enter the filter bed at alkaline groundwater pH (7.6). The experimental pilot column filters showed that once the As(III) oxidation stabilised in the top layer of the filter sand, As removal reached its maximum (±75% at 120 cm supernatant level and 1.5 m/h filtration velocity). The increase in supernatant level from 5 to 120 cm resulted in additional HFO production prior to rapid filtration (1.5, 5 and 10 m/h), i.e. homogeneous Fe(II) oxidation and flocculation, and subsequently, HFO ending up deeper into the filter bed (120 cm filter depth). At a low supernatant water level of 5 cm, Fe(II) oxidised heterogeneously and was removed within the top 20 cm of the filter bed. Consequently, filters with high supernatant levels removed As to lower levels (by 20%) than in filters with low supernatant water levels. The benefits of Fe(II) oxidation prior to filtration for As removal was confirmed by comparing Fe(III) to Fe(II) additions in the supernatant water or in the filter bed. Overall it is concluded that in biological groundwater filters, the combination of a higher supernatant level and/or Fe(III) addition with biological As(III) oxidation in the top of the filter bed promotes As removal. © 2018 The Authors},

In this paper it is hypothesized that Mn-reducing bacteria present in a biofilm on the filter media may be a factor in this Mn-release phenomenon. The primary objective of this research was to assess the role of Mn-reducing microorganisms in the release of soluble Mn from MnOx(s)-coated filter media following interruption of pre-filtration chlorination. Bench-scale filter column studies were inoculated with Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 to investigate the impacts of a known Mn-reducing bacterium on release of soluble Mn from MnOx(s) coatings. In situ vial assays were developed to gain insight into the impacts of MnOx(s) age on bioavailability to Mn-reducing microorganisms and a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method was developed to quantify gene copies of the mtrB gene, which is involved in Mn-reduction. Results demonstrated that microbially-mediated Mn release was possible above a threshold equivalent of 2 × 102 S. oneidensis MR-1 CFU per gram of MnOx(s) coated media and that those organisms contributed to Mn desorption and release. Further, detectable mtrB gene copies were associated with observed Mn desorption. Lastly, MnOx(s) age appeared to play a role in Mn reduction and subsequent release, where MnOx(s) solids of greater age indicated lower bioavailability. These findings can help inform means of preventing soluble Mn release from drinking water treatment plant filters. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Progress towards a more circular phosphorus economy necessitates development of innovative water treatment systems which can reversibly remove inorganic phosphate (Pi) to ultra-low levels (&lt;100 μg L−1), and subsequently recover the Pi for reuse. In this study, a novel approach using the high-affinity E. coli phosphate binding protein (PBP) as a reusable Pi bio-adsorbent was investigated. PBP was expressed, extracted, purified and immobilized on NHS-activated Sepharose beads. The resultant PBP beads were saturated with Pi and exposed to varying pH (pH 4.7 to 12.5) and temperatures (25–45 °C) to induce Pi release. Increase in temperature from 25 to 45 °C and pH conditions between 4.7 and 8.5 released less than 20% of adsorbed Pi. However, 62% and 86% of the adsorbed Pi was released at pH 11.4 and 12.5, respectively. Kinetic experiments showed that Pi desorption occurred nearly instantaneously (&lt;5 min), regardless of pH conditions, which is advantageous for Pi recovery. Additionally, no loss in Pi adsorption or desorption capacity was observed when the PBP beads were exposed to 10 repeated cycles of adsorption/desorption using neutral and high pH (≥12.5) washes, respectively. The highest average Pi adsorption using the PBP beads was 83 ± 5%, with 89 ± 4.1% average desorption using pH 12.5 washes over 10 wash cycles at room temperature. Thermal shift assay of the PBP showed that the protein was structurally stable after 10 cycles, with statistically similar melting temperatures between pH 4 and 12.5. These results indicate that immobilized high-affinity PBP has the potential to be an effective and reversible bio-adsorbent suitable for Pi recovery from water/wastewater. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Population growth paired with growing freshwater scarcity in various parts of the world will reduce the potential of food self-sufficiency in many countries. Today, two thirds of the global population are already living in areas facing severe water scarcity at least one month of the year. This raises the importance of addressing the relationship between water availability and food import in water-scarce countries. Net import of staple crops (including cereals, roots, and tubers) is analysed in relation to water availability per capita for the period 1961–2010, considering five decadal averages. The relation found is used, together with the population growth scenarios from the United Nations, to project staple crop imports in water-scarce countries for the year 2050. As a result of population growth in water-scarce countries alone, global international trade in staple crops is projected to increase by a factor of 1.4–1.8 towards 2050 (compared to the average in 2001–2010), in order to meet the staple food needs of the 42 most water-scarce countries in the world. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={In densely populated areas, surface waters are affected by many sources of pollution. Besides classical pollutants like nutrients and organic matter that lead to eutrophication, micropollutants from various point- and non-point sources are getting more attention by water quality managers. For cost-effective management an integrated assessment is needed that takes into account all relevant pollutants and all sources of pollution within a catchment. Due to the difficulty of identifying and quantifying sources of pollution and the need for considering long-term changes in boundary conditions, typically substantial uncertainty exists about the consequences of potential management alternatives to improve surface water quality. We therefore need integrated assessment methods that are able to deal with multiple objectives and account for various sources of uncertainty. This paper aims to contribute to integrated, prospective water management by combining a) multi-criteria decision support methods to structure the decision process and quantify preferences, b) integrated water quality modelling to predict consequences of management alternatives accounting for uncertainty, and c) scenario planning to consider uncertainty from potential future climate and socio-economic developments, to evaluate the future cost-effectiveness of water quality management alternatives at the catchment scale. It aims to demonstrate the usefulness of multi-attribute value functions for water quality assessment to i) propagate uncertainties throughout the entire assessment procedure, ii) facilitate the aggregation of multiple objectives while avoiding discretization errors when using categories for sub-objectives, iii) transparently communicate the results. We show how to use such multi-attribute value functions for model-based decision support in water quality management. We showcase the procedure for the Mönchaltorfer Aa catchment on the Swiss Plateau. We evaluate ten different water quality management alternatives, including current practice, that tackle macro- and micropollutants from a wide spectrum of agricultural and urban sources. We evaluate costs and water quality effects of the alternatives under four different socio-economic scenarios for the horizon 2050 under present and future climate projections and visualize their uncertainty. While the performance of alternatives is catchment specific, the methods can be transferred to other places and other management situations. Results confirm the need for cross-sectoral coordination of different management actions and interdisciplinary collaboration to support the development of prospective strategies to improve water quality. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={Groundwater contamination by bacteria poses a serious threat to our drinking water supplies. In cold climate regions, microorganisms introduced to upper soil layers by spreading of animal manure are subject to low temperatures and multiple cycles of freezing and thawing at the beginning of winter and during spring melt. We investigated the influence of temperature fluctuations around the freezing point, known as freeze-thaw (FT), on the inactivation rates, growth, and biofilm formation of a manure-isolated strain of Salmonella typhimurium. Moreover, the effects of FT on the transport characteristics of S. typhimurium in quartz sand were monitored in model porewater solutions of two different ionic strengths (IS: 10 and 100 mM KCl) and two different humic acid (HA) concentrations (1 and 5 mg/L). Increasing numbers of FT cycles were found to decrease the deposition of S. typhimurium onto quartz sand and increase the percentage of detached cells in sand-packed column experiments. Based on the calculated bacterial attachment efficiencies, the predicted minimum setback distances between the location of water supply wells and manure spreading activities are higher when the effects of FT are taken into consideration. While FT treatment significantly affected cell viability (in the presence of HA), most cells were in a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state with compromised ability to form biofilm. This investigation demonstrates the effects of spring temperature variations in upper soil layers on S. typhimurium properties and the potential increased risk of bacterial contamination in representative aquifer environments in cold climate regions. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={Capacitive deionization (CDI) is a promising technique for salt removal and may have potential for highly selective removal of ion species. In this work, we take advantage of functional groups usually used with ionic exchange resins and apply these to CDI. To this end, we functionalize activated carbon with a quaternary amines surfactant and use this surface to selectively and passively (no applied field) trap nitrate ions. We then set the cell voltage to a constant value to regenerate these electrodes, resulting in an inverted capacitive deionization (i-CDI) operation. Unlike resins, we avoid use of concentrated chemicals for regeneration. We measure the selectivity of nitrate versus chloride ions as a function of regeneration voltage and initial chloride concentration. We experimentally demonstrate up to about 6.5-fold (observable) selectivity in a cycle with a regeneration voltage of 0.4 V. We also demonstrate a novel multi-pass, air-flush i-CDI operation to selectively enrich nitrate with high water recovery. We further present a dynamic, multi-species electrosorption and equilibrium solution-to-surface chemical reaction model and validate the model with detailed measurements. Our i-CDI system exhibits higher nitrate selectivity at lower voltages; making it possible to reduce NaNO3 concentrations from ∼170 ppm to below the limit of maximum allowed values for nitrate in drinking water of about 50 ppm NaNO3. © 2018},

abstract={Peracetic acid (PAA) is a sanitizer with increasing use in food, medical and water treatment industries. Amino acids are important components in targeted foods for PAA treatment and ubiquitous in natural waterbodies and wastewater effluents as the primary form of dissolved organic nitrogen. To better understand the possible reactions, this work investigated the reaction kinetics and transformation pathways of selected amino acids towards PAA. Experimental results demonstrated that most amino acids showed sluggish reactivity to PAA except cysteine (CYS), methionine (MET), and histidine (HIS). CYS showed the highest reactivity with a very rapid reaction rate. Reactions of MET and HIS with PAA followed second-order kinetics with rate constants of 4.6 ± 0.2, and 1.8 ± 0.1 M−1⋅s−1 at pH 7, respectively. The reactions were faster at pH 5 and 7 than at pH 9 due to PAA speciation. Low concentrations of H2O2 coexistent with PAA contributed little to the oxidation of amino acids. The primary oxidation products of amino acids with PAA were [O] addition compounds on the reactive sites at thiol, thioether and imidazole groups. Theoretical calculations were applied to predict the reactivity and regioselectivity of PAA electrophilic attacks on amino acids and improved mechanistic understanding. As an oxidative disinfectant, the reaction of PAA with organics to form byproducts is inevitable; however, this study shows that PAA exhibits lower and more selective reactivity towards biomolecules such as amino acids than other common disinfectants, causing less concern of toxic disinfection byproducts. This attribute may allow greater stability and more targeted actions of PAA in various applications. © 2018},

abstract={Chemical cleaning is routinely performed in reverse osmosis (RO) plants for the regeneration of RO membranes that suffer from biofouling problems. The potential of urea as a chaotropic agent to enhance the solubilization of biofilm proteins has been reported briefly in the literature. In this paper the efficiency of urea cleaning for RO membrane systems has been compared to conventionally applied acid/alkali treatment. Preliminary assessment confirmed that urea did not damage the RO polyamide membranes and that the membrane cleaning efficiency increased with increasing concentrations of urea and temperature. Accelerated biofilm formation was carried out in membrane fouling simulators which were subsequently cleaned with (i) 0.01M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 0.1M hydrochloric acid (HCl) (typically applied in industry), (ii) urea (CO(NH2)2) and hydrochloric acid, or (iii) urea only (1340 g/Lwater). The pressure drop over the flow channel was used to evaluate the efficiency of the applied chemical cleanings. Biomass removal was evaluated by measuring chemical oxygen demand (COD), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), protein, and carbohydrate content from the membrane and spacer surfaces after cleaning. In addition to protein and carbohydrate quantification of the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), fluorescence excitation−emission matrix (FEEM) spectroscopy was used to distinguish the difference in organic matter of the remaining biomass to assess biofilm solubilization efficacy of the different cleaning agents. Results indicated that two-stage CO(NH2)2/HCl cleaning was as effective as cleaning with NaOH/HCl in terms of restoring the feed channel pressure drop (&gt;70% pressure drop decrease). One-stage cleaning with urea only was not as effective indicating the importance of the second-stage low pH acid cleaning in weakening the biofilm matrix. All three chemical cleaning protocols were equally effective in reducing the concentration of predominant EPS components protein and carbohydrate (&gt;50% reduction in concentrations). However, urea-based cleaning strategies were more effective in solubilizing protein-like matter and tyrosine-containing proteins. Furthermore, ATP measurements showed that biomass inactivation was up to two-fold greater after treatment with urea-based chemical cleanings compared to the conventional acid/alkali treatment. The applicability of urea as an alternative, economical, eco-friendly and effective chemical cleaning agent for the control of biological fouling was successfully demonstrated. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Animals and humans are exposed each day to a multitude of chemicals in the air, water and food. They have developed a battery of enzymes and transporters that facilitate the biotransformation and elimination of these compounds. Moreover, a majority of these enzymes and transporters are inducible due to the activation of xenobiotic receptors which act as transcription factors for the regulation of their target genes (such as xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, see below §4 for the AhR). These receptors include several members of the nuclear/steroid receptor family (CAR for Constitutive Androstane Receptor, PXR for Pregnane X Receptor) but also the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor or AhR, a member of the bHLH-PAS family (basic Helix-Loop-Helix - Period/ARNT/Single minded). In addition to the regulation of xenobiotic metabolism, numerous alternative functions have been characterized for the AhR since its discovery. These alternative functions will be described in this review along with its endogenous functions as revealed by experiments performed on knock-out animals. © 2018 The Author(s)},

abstract={Riverbank filtration (RBF) is used worldwide to produce high quality drinking water. With river water often contaminated by micropollutants (MPs) from various sources, this study addresses the occurrence and fate of such MPs at three different RBF sites with oxic alluvial sediments and short travel times to the drinking water well down to hours. A broad range of MPs with various physico-chemical properties were analysed with detection limits in the low ng L−1 range using solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem high resolution mass spectrometry. Out of the 526 MPs targeted, a total of 123 different MPs were detected above the limit of quantification at the three different RBF sites. Of the 75–96 MPs detected in each river, 43–59% were attenuated during RBF. The remaining total concentrations of the MPs in the raw drinking water accounted to 0.6–1.6 μgL−1 with only a few compounds exceeding 0.1 μgL−1, an often used threshold value. The attenuation was most pronounced in the first meters of infiltration with a full elimination of 17 compounds at all three sites. However, a mixing with groundwater related to regional groundwater flow complicated the characterisation of natural attenuation potentials along the transects. Additional non-target screening at one site revealed similar trends for further non-target components. Overall, a risk assessment of the target and estimated non-target compound concentrations finally indicated during the sampling period no health risk of the drinking water according to current guidelines. Our results demonstrate that monitoring of contamination sources within a catchment and the affected water quality remains important in such vulnerable systems with partially short residence times. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={An infectious retroviral particle contains 1000–1500 molecules of the nucleocapsid protein (NC) that cover the diploid RNA genome. NC is a small zinc finger protein that possesses nucleic acid chaperone activity that enables NC to rearrange DNA and RNA molecules into the most thermodynamically stable structures usually those containing the maximum number of base pairs. Thanks to the chaperone activity, NC plays an essential role in reverse transcription of the retroviral genome by facilitating the strand transfer reactions of this process. In addition, these reactions are involved in recombination events that can generate multiple drug resistance mutations in the presence of anti-HIV-1 drugs. The strand transfer reactions rely on base pairing of folded DNA/RNA structures. The molecular mechanisms responsible for NC-mediated strand transfer reactions are presented and discussed in this review. Antiretroviral strategies targeting the NC-mediated strand transfer events are also discussed. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={For this chapter, a literature search of PubMed/ScienceDirect was performed on January 20th, 2017 using the following search terms: "essential oils AND skin conditions AND treatment". The authors (PM-AOM) screened titles and abstracts for relevance. Articles that did not have an abstract or full text available in English or Spanish were excluded. The remaining publications that included information on treatments of essential oils for skin diseases were analyzed in-depth.After this literature search,11 scientific studies in 8 families of medicinal plants were selected.The species were Lippia sidoides, Origanum vulgare, Cymbopogon flexuosus, Cymbopogon citratus, Curcuma longa, Citrus limetta, Artemisia sieberi Besser, Pamburus missionis (Wight) Swingle, Croton rhamnifolioides, Arborvitae (Thuja plicata) and Frankincense. The major chemical components of the essential oils that exhibited a 20% or higher percentage of relative abundance included neral, germacrone, a-phellandrene, geranial, citronellal, terpinolene, 1,8 cineol, camphor, limonene, methyl-thujane, and carvacol. Most of the studies described investigations of the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of the essential oils. Only one study showed antipigmentation activity, and two studies demonstrated antifungal and anticancer activity in human dermal fibroblasts and skin epidermoid cancer cells. © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={Essential oils are concentrated liquids of complex mixtures of volatile compounds produced during secondary metabolism of plants. Essential oils can be extracted from several plant organs by simple methods, the main is hydro-distillation. Essential oils are a good source of several bioactive compounds, which possess antioxidative and antimicrobial properties. In addition, some essential oils have been used as medicine, recent applications have been studied, for instance anticarcinogens, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antidiabetic. Furthermore, the uses of essential oils have received increasing attention as the natural additives for the shelf-life extension of food products, due to the risk in using synthetic preservatives. Essential oils can be incorporated into packaging, in which they can provide active or smart packaging. Those essential oils can modify the matrix of packaging materials, thereby rendering the improved properties. Other applications of essential oils are in human health as antidiabetic and hypolipidemic.

The formulations were subjected to various in vitro (A549 cell lines) and in vivo evaluations in urethane-induced lung cancer. Co-administration of Gnb and Nar NPs displayed a significant reduction in tumour volume while restoring the biochemical parameters and serum metabolites to normal levels. Significant down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (P-16, MMP-9 and Bcl-2) and up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (caspase-9 and BAX) was displayed with co-therapy. This investigation demonstrated the superiority of co-therapy over individual therapy for improved therapeutic efficacy and is favourable for developing a safe, effective and targeted delivery for lung carcinoma therapy. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={To investigate the role of S100B, oxidative stress and the apoptosis signaling pathways in the sevoflurane induced neuroprotective effect on stroke. The brain injury, molecular and cellular damage, and functional recovery were investigated upon ischemic brain injury followed by sevoflurane treatment. Longa rodent stroke scales was used to quantify neurological deficits. TTC staining was used to measure infarct volume of brain tissue. Absolute brain water content was measured by wet/dry weight method. The neuronal morphological change was assessed by H and E staining. The spatial learning and memory ability were measured by water maze test. Serum proteins including S100B, GSH-PX, SOD, Bcl-2, Bax, Caspase-3 were measured by ELISA. The level of NOS and NO in serum was determined by colorimetric method. Compared with control, the serum proteins including S100B, Bax, NO, Caspase-3, and NOS activity in cerebral infarction rats increased significantly while SOD, GSH-PX, and Bcl-2 decreased significantly. Diabetic mellitus complicated with cerebral infarction rats showed more dramatic increase for S100B, Bax, NO, Caspase-3, and NOS activity and dramatic decrease for SOD, GSH-PX, and Bcl-2. Interestingly, sevoflurane reduced the changes significantly. The S100B level positively correlated with brain damage, NO, Bax, caspase-3, and NOS activity but negatively correlated with SOD, Bax, and GSH-PX. Brain damage in sevoflurane groups decreased while behavior outcomes including Longa neurologic score, learning, and memory increased significantly. The neuroprotective effect of sevoflurane is associated with defense mechanisms against free radical-induced oxidative stress and inhibition of apoptosis. S100B protein correlated with oxidative stress and the apoptosis signaling pathways. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Exosomes are nanovesicles (40–100 nm) containing various RNAs and different proteins. Exosomes are involved in intracellular communication and immune system function. Exosomes from different sources are usually isolated using standard methods—centrifugation and ultracentrifugations. Exosomes isolated by these procedures were reported to contain from a few dozen to thousands of different proteins. Here crude vesicle preparations from five placentas (normal pregnancy) were first obtained using standard centrifugation procedures. According to electron-microscopic studies, these preparations contained vesicles of different size (30–225 nm), particles of round shape of average electron density (“nonvesicles” 20–40 nm) (A), structured clusters of associated proteins and shapeless aggregations (B), as well as ring-shaped 10–14 nm structures formed by ferritin (C). After additional purification of the vesicle preparations by gel filtration on Sepharose 4B, the main part of protein structures was removed; however, the preparations still contained small admixtures of components A–C. Further purification of the preparations by affinity chromatography on Sepharose bearing immobilized antibodies against exosome surface protein CD81 led to isolation of highly purified exosomes (40–100 nm). These exosomes according to electron microscopy data contained tetraspanin embedded in the membrane, which was stained with antibodies against CD81 conjugated with 10–12 nm gold nanoparticles. SDS-PAGE and MALDI MS and MS/MS mass spectrometry of tryptic hydrolysates of proteins contained in these exosomes revealed eleven major proteins (>10 kDa): hemoglobin subunits, CD81, interleukin-1 receptor, annexin A5, cytoplasmic actin, alpha-actin-4, alkaline phosphatase, human serum albumin, serotransferrin, and lactotrasferrin. Using MALDI mass analysis of the highly purified exosomes, we for the first time found that in addition to the large proteins (>10 kDa), exosomes having affinity to CD81 contain more than 27 different peptides and small proteins of 2–10 kDa. This finding can be useful for revealing biological functions of pure exosomes. © 2018 IUBMB Life, 70(11):1144–1155, 2018. © 2018 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology},

abstract={Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most common maligant cancers in the world, is difficult to diagnose in the early time. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs, perform vital functions in cellular differentiation, metabolism and physiological processes. MiR-133a acts as a tumor suppressor in breast, lung and gastric cancer, while the molecular circadian mechanism has not been clear in HCC. In the present study, we certified that the expression of miR-133a decreased in HCC tissues and cell lines and that miR-133a inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Fos-related antigen 2 (FOSL2), also named FRA-2, was predicted to be a downstream target of miR-133a based on bioinformatic analysis and the prediction was verified by Western Blot, qRT-PCR and luciferase reporter assay. In addition, there was a negative correlation between miR-133a and FOSL2 expression in HCC samples. Furthermore, we verified that overexpression of miR-133a suppressed biological behaviour of HCC through TGF-β/Smad3 signaling pathway. In brief, miR-133a may be a potential prognostic biomarker and may thus be a new therapy in HCC. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Aims: A prevalence of vitamin D deficiency has been reported in association with the postmenopause. Thus, we aimed to experimentally study the effect of the vitamin D deficiency and ovariectomy, alone or combined, in the liver damage. Main methods: Three-months-old female mice C57BL/6 with bilateral ovariectomy (Ovx group, n = 30) or a sham procedure (n = 30) were separated feeding control diet (C, n = 15) or a diet restricted in vitamin D (D-, n = 15) during additional 12 weeks. Key findings: Body mass (BM) and blood pressure (BP) were higher in Ovx than in C animals, but highest in Ovx (D-) that also showed glucose intolerance/ insulin resistance. Plasmatic lipids, alanine aspartase transferase, and hepatic steatosis were increased because of the combination of Ovx and D-. However, D- had little implication in the changes of the BM and BP, but affected hepatic steatosis. Gene and protein expressions demonstrated an impaired glucose uptake in the liver because of Ovx and D-, and an increase in lipogenesis and decrease in beta-oxidation in the liver associated more to the Ovx, but also evident in D-. Also, interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha showed an enhancement due to dietary restriction of vitamin D. Significance: The findings demonstrated that ovariectomy and dietary restriction of vitamin D are inducers of harmful effects on the liver of mice, enhancing lipogenesis and inflammation and compromising beta-oxidation. The treatment of vitamin D deficiency is simple and not costly and can reduce the impact of menopause on metabolism and especially the liver. © 2018},

abstract={Many biological functions played by current proteins were not created by evolution from scratch, rather they were obtained combining already available protein scaffolds. This is the case of MocR-like bacterial transcription factors (MocR-TFs), a subclass of GntR transcription regulators, whose structure is the outcome of the fusion between DNA-binding proteins and pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes. The resultant chimeras can count on the properties of both protein classes, i.e. the capability to recognize specific DNA sequences and to bind PLP and amino-compounds; it is the modulation of such binding properties to confer to MocR-TFs chimeras the ability to interact with effector molecules and DNA so as to regulate transcription. MocR-TFs control different metabolic processes involving vitamin B6 and amino acids, which are canonical ligands of PLP-dependent enzymes. However, MocR-TFs are also implicated in the metabolism of compounds that are not substrates of PLP-dependent enzymes, such as rhizopine and ectoine. Genomic analyses show that MocR-TFs are widespread among eubacteria, implying an essential role in their metabolism and highlighting the scarcity of our knowledge on these important players in microbial metabolism. Although MocR-TFs have been discovered 15 years ago, the research activity on these transcriptional regulators has only recently intensified, producing a wealth of information that needs to be brought back to general principles. This is the main task of this review, which reports and analyses the available information concerning MocR-TFs functional role, structural features, interaction with effector molecules and the characteristics of DNA transcriptional factor-binding sites of MocR-based regulatory systems. © 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies},

abstract={In current study, we investigated the changes of proteome profiles of Pycnoporus sanguineus after a single exposure of Cr(VI), TBBPA and a combined exposure of TBBPA and Cr(VI), with the goal of illuminating the cellular mechanisms involved in the interactions of co-existed TBBPA and Cr(VI) with the cells of P. sanguineus at the protein level. The results revealed that some ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters were obviously induced by these pollutants to accelerate the transportation, transformation and detoxification of TBBPA and Cr(VI). Cr(VI) could inhibit the bioremoval of its organic co-pollutants TBBPA through suppressing the expression of several key proteins related to the metabolism of TBBPA by P. sanguineus, including two cytochrome P450s, pentachlorophenol 4-monooxygenase and glutathione S-transferases. Furthermore, Cr(VI) possibly reduced the cell vitality and growth of P. sanguineus by enhancing the expression of imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase as well as by decreasing the abundances of proteins associated with the intracellular metabolic processes, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle, purine metabolism and glutathione biosynthesis, thereby adversely affecting the biotransformation of TBBPA. Cr(VI) also inhibited the expression of peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases, thus causing the damage of cell membrane integrity. In addition, some important proteins participated in the resistance to Cr(VI) toxicity were observed to up-regulate, including heat shock proteins, 26S proteasome, peroxiredoxins and three critical proteins implicated in S-adenosyl methionine synthesis, which contributed to reducing the hazard of Cr(VI) to P. sanguineus. The results of this study provide novel insights into the physiological responses and molecular mechanism of white rot fungi P. sanguineus to the stress of concomitant TBBPA and Cr(VI). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Lectins are proteins of non-immune origin present throughout all kingdoms of life. They are capable of binding to specific carbohydrates reversibly, thus performing several biological roles. Plant lectins are the most studied ones, with hundreds of isolated and characterized hemagglutinins. Most of the known lectins have been isolated from plants belonging to family Leguminosae, which includes genus Bauhinia. This genus comprises over 300 species located in the tropical zones of the planet, where these are utilized in folk medicine because of their numerous medicinal effects, such as anti-inflammatory and antidiabetic actions. Despite being studied for over fifty years, the literature regarding Bauhinia hemagglutinins is scarce, describing just ten proteins isolated from seven different species. Structurally as well as biophysically, there is great similarity among all the known Bauhinia lectins, which may classify them as chemotaxonomic markers; however, the carbohydrate-binding sites and further specificities are unique for each of these proteins. The activities identified for these lectins include growth inhibition in cancer cell lines, cell marking, anti-inflammatory and insecticidal effects, which are just a few among their various other activities of high economic importance. Besides their versatility, four recombinant Bauhinia lectins have already been successfully expressed in heterologous microbial systems, further suggesting that these proteins could serve as promising biotechnological products in future. © 2018},

abstract={Ischemic stroke is one of the leading health issues and the major cause of permanent disability in adults worldwide. Energy depletion and hypoxia occurring after ischemic stroke result in cell death, which activates resident glia cells and promotes the peripheral immune cells breaching into brain performing various functions even contradictory effects. The infiltration of immune cells may mediate neuron apoptosis and escalate ischemic damage, while it enhances neuron repair, differentiation, and neuroregeneration. The central nervous system (CNS) is immune-privileged site as it is separated from the peripheral immune system by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Pathologically, the diapedesis of peripheral immune cells to CNS is controlled by BBB and regulated by immune cells/endothelial interactions. As immune responses play a key role in modulating the progression of ischemic injury development, understanding the characteristics and the contribution on regulating inflammatory responses of glia cells and peripheral immune cells may provide novel approaches for potential therapies. This review summarizes the multistep process of periphery immune cell extravasation into brain parenchyma during immunosurveillance and chronic inflammation after ischemic stroke onset. Furthermore, the review highlights promising target intervention, which may promote the development of future therapeutics for ischemic stroke. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein platform which is activated upon cellular infection or stress. Its activation leads to caspase-1-dependent secretion of proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18, and an inflammatory form of cell death termed as pyroptosis. Recent studies have unveiled the pivotal roles of mitochondria in initiation and regulation of the NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-repeat containing family, pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasome. NLRP3 activators induce mitochondrial destabilization, NLRP3 deubiquitination, linear ubiquitination of ASC, and externalization or release of mitochondria-derived molecules such as cardiolipin and mitochondrial DNA. These molecules bind to NLRP3 that is translocated on mitochondria and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Here we review recently described mechanisms by which mitochondria regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: There is limited data about the anti-breast cancer activity of noni fruit ethanolic extract. Topical route is gaining interest as an alternative route for breast cancer treatment. Objectives: The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of noni fruit extract on cytotoxicity and cell migration suppression in Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) human breast cancer cells and to develop topical microemulsions (MEs). Materials and Methods: The noni fruit ethanolic extract was prepared. Rutin content, a marker, in the extract was analyzed, and the antioxidant activity of the extract was determined. Cytotoxicity and cell migration suppression, indicating anti-breast cancer activity, were also assessed in MCF-7 cells by SRB assay and wound-healing assay. The MEs were developed by titration method. The developed noni MEs were evaluated regarding their physical appearance, viscosity, and pH before and after stability test. Results: Results showed that the rutin content in the noni extract was 4.02 ± 0.34 mg/g. The extract possessed antioxidant activity with inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 1.03 ± 0.01 mg/ml. It also showed cytotoxicity with IC 50 values of 158.4 ± 12.5 μg/ml and cell migration suppression on MCF-7 cells with significant effect at 100 μg/ml. Eight ME systems were selected to incorporate the extract. Conclusion: Noni extract had potential anti-breast cancer activity. The ME, named noni ME-3, consisting of 0.7% w/w noni extract, 56% w/w olive oil, 20% w/w polysorbate 80, 20% w/w sorbitan oleate, and 4% w/w water phase, was shown to be the most attractive noni ME for the topical treatment of breast cancer. © 2019 Pharmacognosy Magazine Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.},

The influence of five doses of each EOs was tested against Botrytis cinerea, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Fusarium oxysporum, Phytophthora parasitica, Pythium aphanidermatum, Alternaria brassicae, Cladobotryum mycophilum and Trichoderma aggressivum f.sp. europaeum using disc-diffusion method. The mycelial growth inhibition and ED50 were calculated. The chemical analysis of the EOs was analysed using gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy. A total of 58 compounds were identified in the 12 EOs. All essential oils (EOs) analysed showed antifungal activity against the test pathogens in the range of 5·32–100%. The inhibitory effect of oils showed dose-dependent activity on the tested fungus. Based on the ED50 values, clove, rose geranium, peppermint and patchouli were the most effective. This study warrants further research into the practical use of EOs for the control of important myco- and phytopathogens in intensive horticulture. Significance and Impact of the Study: Due to the serious damage caused by fungal pathogens of vegetables and mushrooms, it is necessary to search for integrated strategies of disease control. This study provides relevant information about the effects of 12 essential oils (EOs) against eight pathogens of agricultural interest, included mycopathogens with emphasis on the possible future application of the EOs as alternative antifungal agents. © 2018 The Society for Applied Microbiology},

A Smith–Waterman algorithm was used to infer a couple of lncRNAs from WES samples of CPC with predictions from the Noncode database. Further screening and quantification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we ascertained interactions using Micro Scale Thermophoresis (MST).

abstract={Very few studies have investigated the biological activities of black pepper essential oil (BPEO) in human cells. Therefore, in the current study, we examined the biological activities of BPEO in cytokine-stimulated human dermal fibroblasts by analyzing the levels of 17 important protein biomarkers pertinent to inflammation and tissue remodeling. BPEO exhibited significant antiproliferative activity in these skin cells and significantly inhibited the production of Collagen I, Collagen III, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1. In addition, we studied the effect of BPEO on the regulation of genome-wide expression and found that BPEO diversely modulated global gene expression. Further analysis showed that BPEO affected many important genes and signaling pathways closely related to metabolism, inflammation, tissue remodeling, and cancer signaling. This study is the first to provide evidence of the biological activities of BPEO in human dermal fibroblasts. The data suggest that BPEO possesses promising potential to modulate the biological processes of tissue remodeling, wound healing, and metabolism. Although further research is required, BPEO appears to be a good therapeutic candidate for a variety of health conditions including wound care and metabolic diseases. Research into the biological and pharmacological mechanisms of action of BPEO and its major active constituents is recommended. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Naringenin, a citrus flavonoid that possesses various biological activities, has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for the management of a variety of diseases. Studies using cell culture system have shown that naringenin can inhibit inflammatory response in diverse cell types. Moreover, research using various animal models has further demonstrated therapeutic potentials of naringenin in the treatment of several inflammation-related disorders, such as sepsis, fulminant hepatitis, fibrosis and cancer. The mechanism of action of naringenin is not completely understood but recent mechanistic studies revealed that naringenin suppresses inflammatory cytokine production through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Surprisingly, naringenin not only inhibits cytokine mRNA expression but also promotes lysosome-dependent cytokine protein degradation. This unique property of naringenin stands in sharp contrast with some widely-studied natural products such as apigenin and curcumin, which regulate cytokine production essentially at the transcriptional level. Therefore, naringenin may provide modality for the development of novel anti-inflammatory agent. This review article summarizes our recent studies in understanding how naringenin acts in cells and animal models. Particularly, we will discuss the anti-inflammatory activities of naringenin in various disease context and its potential use, as an immunomodulator, in the treatment of inflammatory related disease. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Origanum vulgare is a well-known medicinal plant that has been used since ancient times as an additive in foods and cosmetic preparations. The possible application of O. vulgare extracts in fish was assessed by using gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) as a marine fish model due to its importance in aquaculture. The in vitro effects of aqueous and ethanolic leaf extracts of O. vulgare were tested in order to observe any immunostimulant, cytotoxic, bactericidal or antioxidant properties. The results showed that medium or high concentration of aqueous extracts and low concentrations of ethanolic extract, increased head kidney leucocyte activities as well as the number of SAF-1 cells. However, moderate to high concentrations of ethanolic extracts decreased both leucocyte activities and the number of viable SAF-1 cells, suggesting some possible toxic effect towards them. Only the highest concentration of the aqueous extract and medium to high concentrations of the ethanolic extracts showed cytotoxic activity against the tumor PLHC-1 cell line. Bactericidal activity was only detected against Vibrio harveyi, V. anguillarum and Photobacterium damselae when using the highest concentration of aqueous extract and moderate to high concentrations of ethanolic extract. Finally, both plant extracts presented antioxidant activity particularly the aqueous extract. Overall, the results suggest that both extracts (when used at the appropriate concentration) have immunostimulant, cytotoxic, bactericidal and antioxidant properties, making O. vulgare an interesting candidate for incorporation as additive in functional diets for farmed fish. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Diminished bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO), the gaseous signaling molecule involved in the regulation of numerous vital biological functions, contributes to the development and progression of multiple age-and lifestyle-related diseases. While L-arginine is the precursor for the synthesis of NO by endothelial-nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), oral L-arginine supplementation is largely ineffective at increasing NO synthesis and/or bioavailability for a variety of reasons. L-citrulline, found in high concentrations in watermelon, is a neutral alpha-amino acid formed by enzymes in the mitochondria that also serves as a substrate for recycling L-arginine. Unlike L-arginine, L-citrulline is not quantitatively extracted from the gastrointestinal tract (i.e., enterocytes) or liver and its supplementation is therefore more effective at increasing L-arginine levels and NO synthesis. Supplementation with L-citrulline has shown promise as a blood pressure lowering intervention (both resting and stress-induced) in adults with pre-/hypertension, with pre-clinical (animal) evidence for atherogenic-endothelial protection. Preliminary evidence is also available for L-citrulline-induced benefits to muscle and metabolic health (via vascular and non-vascular pathways) in susceptible/older populations. In this review, we examine the impact of supplementing this important urea cycle intermediate on cardiovascular and metabolic health outcomes and identify future directions for investigating its therapeutic impact on cardiometabolic health. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={Buckypapers have emerged as an important material for the construction of enzyme-based electrodes and biofuel cells for energy harvesting. In this work, commercial and lab-made buckypapers have been compared to establish their properties for future use as advanced bioelectrodes. The physical properties of the paper-like carbon nanotube films were characterised by electron microscopy, four-point probe conductivity, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical properties were investigated by voltammetry in the absence and presence of redox probes. Bioelectrocatalytic oxygen reduction was evaluated with iron-protoporphyrin modified buckypapers after immobilisation of bilirubin oxidase. Lab-made buckypaper exhibited a wider potential window, lower background capacitance, and cleaner voltammetry compared to commercial buckypaper. The catalytic current of lab-made buckypaper was 10-fold larger due to factors which include the 10-fold larger BET surface area, higher enzyme loading, more defective structure, and the smaller nanotube diameters. The presence of porphyrin groups enhanced the catalytic current in O2-saturated solution up to 0.5 mA cm−2 and 1.3 mA cm−2 for commercial and lab-made buckypaper, respectively. This work sheds new light on the effects of various physicochemical properties on the electrochemical and DET-type bioelectrocatalytic activity of buckypapers, and promises to be important for the development of bioelectronics devices. © 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={The coconut kernel-associated fungus, Lasiodiplodia theobromae VBE1, was grown on coconut cake with added coconut oil as lipase inducer under solid-state fermentation conditions. The extracellular-produced lipases were purified and resulted in two enzymes: lipase A (68,000 Da)—purified 25.41-fold, recovery of 47.1%—and lipase B (32,000 Da)—purified 18.47-fold, recovery of 8.2%. Both lipases showed optimal activity at pH 8.0 and 35 °C, were activated by Ca2+, exhibited highest specificity towards coconut oil and p-nitrophenyl palmitate, and were stable in iso-octane and hexane. Ethanol supported higher lipase activity than methanol, and n-butanol inactivated both lipases. Crude lipase immobilized by entrapment within 4% (w/v) calcium alginate beads was more stable than the crude-free lipase preparation within the range pH 2.5–10.0 and 20–80 °C. The immobilized lipase preparation was used to catalyze the transesterification/methanolysis of coconut oil to biodiesel (fatty acyl methyl esters (FAMEs)) and was quantified by gas chromatography. The principal FAMEs were laurate (46.1%), myristate (22.3%), palmitate (9.9%), and oleate (7.2%), with minor amounts of caprylate, caprate, and stearate also present. The FAME profile was comparatively similar to NaOH-mediated transesterified biodiesel from coconut oil, but distinctly different to petroleum-derived diesel. This study concluded that Lasiodiplodia theobromae VBE1 lipases have potential for biodiesel production from coconut oil. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Natural polyphenols, frequently called secondary metabolites, play an important role in cancer prevention and treatment. Polyphenols are characterized by high structural diversity, which translates into a very wide therapeutic spectrum, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, proapoptotic, anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic activities. These compounds can modulate the activities of some functional proteins and enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases, including type IV collagenases (MMP-2 and MMP-9). Type IV collagenases are able to degrade the protein components of the extracellular matrix and play key roles in physiological processes, such as tissue repair and morphogenesis, as well as in carcinogenesis and other pathological processes. This review discusses the current state of knowledge concerning the anti-invasion and anti-metastatic potential of natural polyphenol-rich extracts, with a focus on in vitro and in vivo evidence. Based on these findings, plant extracts may be a promising alternative strategy to synthetic MMP-2/-9 inhibitors of cancer invasiveness and metastasis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Overall survival benefits of cancer therapies have, in general, fallen short of what was expected from them. By examining the many parallels that exist between embryogenesis and carcinogenesis, we discuss how clinical and fundamental cancer research can benefit from computational morphogenesis (CM) insofar as carcinogenesis is causally related to altered mechanisms underlying embryogenesis and post-embryonic tissue homeostasis. We also discuss about the critical role played by digital pathology (DP) since it constitutes the main source of data for the model-fitting and validation of CM-generated virtual tissues. Conversely, we outline how CM can provide support to DP by generating annotated synthetic 2D and 3D data that can be fed into machine-learning methods dedicated to the automated diagnosis of DP slides. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Flooding negatively affects the growth of soybean, whereas the plant-derived smoke enhances seedling growth of crops. To clarify the mechanism underlying the recovery from flooding stress, proteomic analysis was performed based on morphological results. Growth of soybean seedlings was inhibited under flooding stress, but it recovered after water removal following treatment with plant-derived smoke. Sucrose/starch metabolism and glycolysis were suppressed in smoke-treated flooded soybean compared to flooded soybean. The protein abundance and gene expression of O-fucosyltransferase family proteins related to the cell wall were higher in smoke-treated flooded soybean than in flooded soybean. Protein abundance and gene expression of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase and Bowman-Birk proteinase isoinhibitor D-II were lower in smoke-treated flooded soybean than in flooded soybean. Taken together, these results suggest that plant-derived smoke enhances soybean growth during recovery from flooding stress through the balance of sucrose/starch metabolism and glycolysis. Furthermore, the accumulation of cell-wall related protein might be an important factor contributing to recovery of soybean from flooding stress. Biological significance: Flooding negatively affects the growth of soybean, whereas the plant-derived smoke enhances the seedling growth of crops. To clarify the mechanism underlying the recovery from flooding stress, proteomic analysis of soybean with different treatments including normal conditions, flooding stress, and flooding stress in the presence of plant-derived smoke was performed in this study. Growth of soybean seedlings was inhibited under flooding stress, however, it recovered with plant-derived smoke treatment during recovery from flooding stress. Sucrose/starch metabolism and glycolysis were suppressed in smoke-treated flooded soybean compared to flooded soybean, which suggests altered sucrose/starch metabolism and glycolysis contribute to soybean growth recovery from flood stress. Furthermore, the protein abundance and gene expression of O-fucosyltransferase family proteins related to the cell wall was higher in smoke-treated flooded soybean than in flooded soybean, which might be an important factor contributing to the recovery of soybean from flooding stress. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

The results indicate that FRP reacted strongly with human blood group ABH and L-Fucα1→2-active glycotopes and in their polyvalent (super) forms. When expressed by mass relative potency, the binding affinities of FRP to poly-L-Fucα1→glycotopes were about 5.0 × 105 folds higher than that of the mono-L-Fucα1→glycotope form. This unique binding property of FRP can be used as a special tool to differentiate complex forms of L-Fucα1→2 and other forms of glycotopes. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={The sodium leak channel NALCN is poorly understood, but is reported as a Na+-permeable, nonselective cation leak channel which regulates resting membrane potential and electrical excitability. Previous work has indicated that NALCN currents can be stimulated by activation of several G protein coupled receptors, including the M3 muscarinic receptor. We undertook a study using voltage clamp electrophysiology to investigate NALCN currents. We compared currents elicited from untransfected control HEK239 cells in response to M3R agonists muscarine or Oxotremorine M to currents elicited from cells transfected with M3R only or the M3R plus NALCN and cDNA encoding accessory proteins UNC-80 and Src. Currents with similar properties were observed in all three groups of cells in response to muscarine agonists, in similar proportions of cells tested, from all three groups of cells. Our findings do not support previous electrophysiological studies suggesting that heterologously expressed NALCN functions as a Na+ leak channel in HEK293 cells. More research will be required to determine the molecular requirements for successful expression of the NALCN channel. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Introduction Production of isoprostanes (IsoPs) is enhanced after acute, intense, and prolonged exercise, in untrained subjects. This effect is greater in older subjects. The present study aims to delineate the profile of acute-exercise-induced IsoPs levels in young and older endurance-trained subjects. Methods All included subjects were male, young (n = 6; 29 yrs ± 5.7) or older (n = 6; 63.7 yrs ± 2.3), and competitors. The kinetics of F2-IsoPs in blood-sera was assessed at rest, for the maximal aerobic exercise power (MAP) corresponding to the cardio-respiratory fitness index and after a 30-min recovery period. Results No significant time effect on F2-IsoPs kinetics was identified in young subjects. However, in older athletes, F2-IsoPs blood-concentrations at the MAP were higher than at rest, whereas these blood-concentrations did not differ between rest and after the 30-min recovery period. Conclusion Because plasma glutathione (GSH) promotes the formation of some F2-IsoPs, we suggest that the surprising decrease in F2-IsoPs levels in older subjects would be caused by decreased GSH under major ROS production in older subjects. We argue that the assessment F2-IsoPs in plasma as biomarkers of the aging process should be challenged by exercise to improve the assessment of the functional response against reactive oxygen species in older subjects. © 2017 The Author(s)},

abstract={Herbal drugs, on which 80% of the world's population rely, are relatively safe over conventional drugs. Conventional drugs are costly, have serious side effects and hence over the past few decades researchers have focused on drug discovery from herbal medicines or botanical sources. The majority of new herbal drugs have been generated from secondary metabolites (alkaloids, terpenoids and phenolic compounds) of plant metabolism. Till date, only a small fraction of the vast diversity of plant metabolism has been explored for the production of new medicines and other products. The emergence of new herbal genomics research, medicinal plant genomics consortium, together with advances in other omics information may help for the speedy discovery of previously unknown metabolic pathways and enzymes. This review highlights the importance of genomics research in the discovery of some previously unknown enzymes/pathways which may make significant contributions in plant metabolic biology and may be used for the future discovery of many new pharmaceutical agents. © 2018},

abstract={The chemical and phytochemical characteristics of argan oil (Argania spinosa L. skeels), olive oil (Olea europaea L. cv. Moroccan picholine), cactus pear (Opuntia megacantha salm-dyck) seed oil and cactus cladode essential oil were investigated. The values for acidity varied from 0.28% in argan oil to 1.05% in olive oil. The peroxide values were between 2.26 and 2.84 meq O2/kg oil while the coefficients of specific extinction at 232 and 270 nm ranged from 1.04 to 1.83 and from 0.14 to 0.23, respectively. Regarding fatty acids composition, the essential oil of cactus cladodes (CCEO) contains high concentration of linolenic acid. The cactus pear seed oil has the highest content of linoleic acid, while in argan oil, oleic and linoleic acids were the main fatty acids detected. The total phytosterols content ranged from 203.80 mg/100 g in olive oil to 2131.40 mg/100 g in the CCEO. β-sitosterol was the main phytosterol found in olive oil and cactus pear seed oil. The argan oil is rich in spinasterol and schottenol while the CCEO contains high level of sitostanol. Olive oil encloses 115.80 mg/kg of tocopherols, mainly α-tocopherol form; argan oil has 752.20 mg/kg of tocopherols with dominantly γ-tocopherol, while cactus pear seed oil contains mainly both β-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol. However, α-tocopherol was the only tocopherol detected in CCEO, which interestingly revealed the highest concentration (17.82 mg/kg) of saturated hydrocarbons. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Background: An important step in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication is the packaging of tRNA3 Lys from the host cell, which plays the role of primer RNA in the process of initiation of reverse transcription. The viral GagPol polyprotein precursor, and the human mitochondrial lysyl-tRNA synthetase (mLysRS) from the host cell, have been proposed to be involved in the packaging process. More specifically, the catalytic domain of mLysRS is supposed to interact with the transframe (TF or p6) and integrase (IN) domains of the Pol region of the GagPol polyprotein. Results: In this work, we report a quantitative characterization of the protein:protein interactions between mLysRS and its viral partners, the Pol polyprotein, and the isolated integrase and transframe domains of Pol. A dissociation constant of 1.3 ± 0.2 nM was determined for the Pol:mLysRS interaction, which exemplifies the robustness of this association. The protease and reverse transcriptase domains of GagPol are dispensable in this association, but the TF and IN domains have to be connected by a linker polypeptide to recapitulate a high affinity partner for mLysRS. The binding of the viral proteins to mLysRS does not dramatically enhance the binding affinity of mLysRS for tRNA3 Lys. Conclusions: These data support the conclusion that the complex formed between GagPol, mLysRS and tRNA3 Lys, which involves direct interactions between the IN and TF domains of Pol with mLysRS, is more robust than suggested by the previous models supposed to be involved in the packaging of tRNA3 Lys into HIV-1 particles. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Catalytic four-electron reduction of O2 to water is one of the most extensively studied electrochemical reactions due to O 2 exceptional availability and high O2 /H 2 O redox potential, which may in particular allow highly energetic reactions in fuel cells. To circumvent the use of expensive and inefficient Pt catalysts, multicopper oxidases (MCOs) have been envisioned because they provide efficient O 2 reduction with almost no overpotential. MCOs have been used to elaborate enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs), a subclass of fuel cells in which enzymes replace the conventional catalysts. A glucose/O2 EBFC, with a glucose oxidizing anode and a O 2 reducing MCO cathode, could become the in vivo source of electricity that would power sometimes in the future integrated medical devices. This review covers the challenges and advances in the electrochemistry of MCOs and their use in EBFCs with a particular emphasis on the last 6 years. First basic features of MCOs and EBFCs are presented. Clues provided by electrochemistry to understand these enzymes and how they behave once connected at electrodes are described. Progresses realized in the development of efficient biocathodes for O2 reduction relying both on direct and mediated electron transfer mechanism are then discussed. Some implementations in EBFCs are finally presented. © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The study aims to investigate the effect of argan oil on plasma lipid concentrations through a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials. Randomized controlled trials that investigated the impact of at least 2 weeks of supplementation with argan oil on plasma/serum concentrations of at least 1 of the main lipid parameters were eligible for inclusion. Effect size was expressed as the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Meta-analysis of data from 5 eligible trials with 292 participants showed a significant reduction in plasma concentrations of total cholesterol (WMD: −16.85 mg/dl, 95% CI [−25.10, −8.60], p <.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (WMD: −11.67 mg/dl, 95% CI [−17.32, −6.01], p <.001), and triglycerides (WMD: −13.69 mg/dl, 95% CI [−25.80, −1.58], p =.027) after supplementation with argan oil compared with control treatment, and plasma concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (WMD: 4.14 mg/dl, 95% CI [0.86, 7.41], p =.013) were found to be increased. Argan oil supplementation reduces total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Additionally, larger clinical trials are needed to assess the impact of argan oil supplementation on other indices of cardiometabolic risk and on the risk of cardiovascular outcomes.

abstract={Lung carcinoma is the most common cancer in men and second in women (preceded by breast cancer) worldwide. Around 1 in 10 of all cancers diagnosed in men, lung cancer contributed to a total fraction of 20% cancer deaths. Naringenin (NAR) is well known for its chemopreventive properties since ancient times but lacks an appropriate delivery carrier. The objective of present study was to expand the functionality of naringenin loaded poly caprolactone (PCL) nanoparticles in terms of release, chemoprevention and therapeutics. Polymeric nanoparticles such as PCL lack target specificity; hence, surface modification was attempted using layer by layer technique (LBL) to achieve improved and desired delivery as well as target specificity. The designing of Hyaluronic acid (HA) decorated PCL nanoparticles were prepared by utilizing self-assembling LBL technique, where a polycationic layer of a polymer was used as a linker for modification between two polyanionic layers. Additionally, an attempt has been made to strengthen the therapeutic efficacy of PCL nanocarriers by active targeting and overcoming the extracellular matrix associated barriers of tumors using HA targeting cluster determinant 44 receptor (CD44). Cell cytotoxicity study on A549 cells and J774 macrophage cells depicted enhanced anticancer effect of NAR-HA@CH-PCL-NP with safe profile on macrophages. Uptake study on A549 cells advocated enhanced drug uptake by cancer cells. Cell cycle arrest analysis (A549 cell lines) demonstrated the superior cytotoxic effect and active targeting of NAR-HA@CH-PCL-NP. Further chemopreventive treatment with NAR-HA@CH-PCL-NP was found effective in tumor growth inhibitory effect against urethane-induced lung cancer in rat. In conclusion, developed formulation possesses a promising potential as a therapeutic and chemopreventive agent against urethane-induced lung carcinoma in albino wistar rats. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={Bacterial proteins belonging to the YczE family are predicted to be membrane proteins of yet unknown function. In many bacterial species, the yczE gene coding for the YczE protein is divergently transcribed with respect to an adjacent transcriptional regulator of the MocR family. According to in silico predictions, proteins named YczR are supposed to regulate the expression of yczE genes. These regulators linked to the yczE genes are predicted to constitute a subfamily within the MocR family. To put forward hypotheses amenable to experimental testing about the possible function of the YczE proteins, a phylogenetic profile strategy was applied. This strategy consists in searching for those genes that, within a set of genomes, co-occur exclusively with a certain gene of interest. Co-occurrence can be suggestive of a functional link. A set of 30 mycobacterial complete proteomes were collected. Of these, only 16 contained YczE proteins. Interestingly, in all cases each yczE gene was divergently transcribed with respect to a yczR gene. Two orthology clustering procedures were applied to find proteins co-occurring exclusively with the YczE proteins. The reported results suggest that YczE may be involved in the membrane translocation and metabolism of sulfur-containing compounds mostly in rapidly growing, low pathogenicity mycobacterial species. These observations may hint at potential targets for therapies to treat the emerging opportunistic infections provoked by the widespread environmental mycobacterial species and may contribute to the delineation of the genomic and physiological differences between the pathogenic and non-pathogenic mycobacterial species. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.},

abstract={Hypoxia, the most commonly observed characteristic in cancers, is implicated in the establishment of an immunosuppressive niche. Recent studies have indicated that extracellular vesicle (EV)-mediated cancer-stroma interactions are considered to play a critical role in the regulation of various cellular biological functions, with phenotypic consequences in recipient cells. However, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between EVs and hypoxia during cancer progression remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that EVs derived from hypoxic lung cancers increased M2-type polarization by miR-103a transfer. Decreased PTEN levels caused by hypoxic cancer-cell-derived EV miR-103a increased activation of AKT and STAT3 as well as expression of several immunosuppressive and pro-angiogeneic factors. In contrast, inhibition of miR-103a by an miRNA inhibitor effectively decreased hypoxic cancer-mediated M2-type polarization, improving the cytokine prolife of tumor infiltration macrophages. Macrophages received cancer-cell-derived EV miR-103a feedback to further enhance cancer progression and tumor angiogenesis. Finally, circulating EV miR-103a levels were higher in patients with lung cancer and closely associated with the M2 polarization. In conclusion, our results delineate a novel mechanism by which lung cancer cells induce immunosuppressive and pro-tumoral macrophages through EVs and inspire further research into the clinical application of EV inhibition or PTEN restoration for immunotherapy. Extracellular vesicle (EV) miR-103 can be transferred from hypoxic cancer cells to macrophages, resulting in the enhancement of M2 polarization by the downregulation of miR-103a's direct target PTEN. EV miR-103a increases the stimulatory effects of macrophages on cancer progression and angiogenesis. © 2017 The Author(s)},

abstract={From the evidence on clinical studies and experimental mouse models we now know that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) sustain tumor development in many different ways. They play a role in angiogenesis, tumor cell invasion, and metastasis formation. Additionally, TAMs interfere with natural killer and T-cell antitumoral activities, producing an immune-suppressive environment that protects tumor cell growth. This indicates that the tumoricidal activity of macrophages within the tumor microenviroment is lost due to an imbalance of the regulatory mechanisms underpinning these cells’ function. Since metabolism is emerging as a major modulator of macrophage function, metabolic changes in response to signals coming from cancer or other immune cells might promote this imbalance, enhancing the tumorigenic activities of TAMs. In this review we describe the novel, most recent findings on how metabolism shapes TAM functions or conversely, how TAMs influence the activity of other cells through metabolic mechanisms. The complete elucidation of the metabolic switches between pro- and antitumoral properties of macrophages, now still in its infancy, is destined to provide scientists with new instruments not only to understand but also to combat cancer. © 2017 Federation of European Biochemical Societies},

abstract={Lavender and immortelle essential oils (EOs) are widely used to treat a spectrum of human conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate cyto/genotoxic effects of lavender and immortelle EOs using plant cells (Allium cepa) and human lymphocytes, as well as their antimicrobial potential using nine strains of bacteria and fungi. Our results for lavender and immortelle EOs showed that the frequency of chromosome aberrations (CAs) was increased in comparison with controls. For both oils, increased frequency of apoptosis for all concentrations, as well as the frequency of necrosis (0.10/0.30 µl/ml for lavender/immortelle, respectively) was demonstrated. In human lymphocytes, differences for minute fragments between immortelle oil (0.10 µl/ml) and controls were observed. Increased frequency of apoptosis was detected for immortelle oil (0.20 µl/ml), while both oils (0.20; 0.30 µl/ml lavender, and immortelle at all concentrations) induced higher frequency of necrosis in comparison with controls. Lavender EO was effective against all tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, while immortelle EO inhibited only Gram-positive bacteria. Both oils exhibited antifungal effect. Our results demonstrated that lavender and immortelle EOs showed cyto/genotoxic effects in both, plant and human cells, as well as antimicrobial properties. Further studies are needed to strengthen these findings. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={In this study, the chemical variation of the essential oils of the endemic species Origanum elongatum has been studied in its biogeographical context. Essential oils of 168 individual plants collected from 30 populations growing wild in two Moroccan mountains: Rif and Middle Atlas, were analyzed by GC-FID (Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detector), GC/MS (Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry) and 13C NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance). Origanum elongatum produces an EOs yielding after hydrodistillation from 0.81% to 3.12% based on the dry weight of the original biomass. 28 compounds were identified, with a majority of oxygenated monoterpenes among them carvacrol, thymol and p-cymene constitute the most represented compounds. Moreover, a great amount of α-terpinene, limonene, thymoquinone and thymohydroquinone were reported in some samples. Four chemical groups have been identified, namely; carvacrol, carvacrol/thymol, carvacrol/p-cymene and thymol. The geographic distributions of these chemotypes appear to vary since the carvacrol chemotype was the most distributed, while the thymol was found more abundantly in populations from Rif. However, the carvacrol/p-cymene chemotype was revealed only in Taza region. For the first time the whole chemical picture of the EOs of O. elongatum is presented in relation to their geographical distribution such knowledge is primordial in developing a breeding program in order to protect this species widely and intensively used for both medicinal and food uses but also supply the continuous market needs by producing high quality and stable raw material. © 2018 King Saud University},

abstract={The study was conducted to understand better the mechanisms involved in liver changes when there is a combination of diet-induced obesity (DIO) and vitamin D deficiency (VDD). After 8 wk of feeding a control diet (C group) or a high-fat diet (HF), both with vitamin D, and counterpart groups without vitamin D (VitD- groups), we found in plasma: higher alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase in the VitD- groups, and more elevated total cholesterol in the HF group. Compared to their counterparts, HF and HF/VitD- showed hyperinsulinemia and higher hepatic triglycerides and steatosis. The protein expressions of markers linked with the vitamin D action were altered by VDD (vitamin D receptor VDR, 25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase CYP24A1, CYP27B1, and CYP2R1). The hepatic lipogenesis and fatty acid synthesis were enhanced by VDD (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPARκ, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins SREBP1c, carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein ChREBP, and fatty acid synthase FAS), but markers of beta-oxidation were reduced (PPARα and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase PEPCK). In conclusion, the study provides convincing new evidence that there is an additive and adverse effect on the liver caused by the combination of VDD and DIO. The essence of these changes in the liver is in an increased lipogenesis and a reduced beta-oxidation, which predisposes to the accumulation of fat in the liver, accompanied by IR. The worsening of the pathogenesis of NAFLD may tilt to more severe stages of liver disease. © 2018, Center for Academic Publications Japan. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The construction of streamlines is one of the most important techniques to visualize flow patterns. Here we describe the method of obtaining streamlines as contour lines of the stream function. We point out advantages in comparison to the more frequently used method of particle tracing. A major plus of the stream function approach is that equidistant spacing of contour levels guarantees that stream tubes between adjacent streamlines conduct the same flow. Thus, illustrations from stream function contouring reveal important flow field information that cannot be obtained so easily otherwise. We address the problem of streamline continuation at branch cuts. A modified contouring is outlined that overcomes the difficulty. We demonstrate the method using applications in the field of groundwater flow with wells. © 2018 by Begell House, Inc.},

abstract={Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) has been demonstrated as a key regulator of immune responses including monocyte/macrophage functions. TGF-β regulates macrophage cell migration and polarization, as well as it is shown to modulate macrophage urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) production, which also contributes to macrophage chemotaxis and migration toward damaged or inflamed tissues. Microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton dynamic plays a key role during the cell motility, and any interference on the MT network profoundly affects cell migration. In this study, by using estramustine phosphate (EP), which modifies MT stability, we analysed whether tubulin cytoskeleton contributes to TGF-β-induced macrophage cell migration and uPA expression. We found out that, in the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, EP at noncytotoxic concentrations inhibited cell migration and uPA expression induced by TGF-β. Moreover, EP greatly reduced the capacity of TGF-β to trigger the phosphorylation and activation of its downstream Smad3 effector. Furthermore, Smad3 activation seems to be critical for the increased cell motility. Thus, our data suggest that EP, by interfering with MT dynamics, inhibits TGF-β-induced RAW 264.7 cell migration paralleled with reduction of uPA induction, in part by disabling Smad3 activation by TGF-β. © 2018 Sonja S.

abstract={Sepsis is a complex disease and is the cause of many deaths worldwide. Sepsis pathogenesis involves a dysregulated inflammatory response with consequent production of inflammatory mediators and reactive species. The production and excessive release of these substances into the systemic circulation trigger various cellular and metabolic alterations that are observed during the disease evolution. Thus, more studies have been carried out to investigate the therapeutic potential of plants such as Morus nigra L., popularly known as black mulberry. Studies have shown that plants belonging to the Morus genus are rich in secondary metabolites such as flavonoids which are associated with important biological activities as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. Based on this context, the objective of our study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of Morus nigra L. in a sepsis model induced by LPS. Male C57BL/6 mice were distributed in four groups: control, sepsis, sepsis treated with leaf extract of mulberry, and sepsis treated with mulberry pulp. The animals were treated with 100 μL of their respective treatments for twenty-one days. Sepsis was induced at the 21st day with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by intraperitoneal injection. The animals were euthanized 24 hours after receiving the LPS injection. The data obtained were analyzed in GraphPad Prism 6.0 software. Our results showed that treatment with either extract significantly decreased the number of leukocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum levels of TNF in septic animals. Regarding the redox status, the treatments significantly decreased the antioxidant activity of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase. Regarding metalloproteinase type 2, it was observed that the treatment with black mulberry pulp was able to significantly reduce the activity of this enzyme concerning the sepsis group. Finally, these results together promoted an increase in the animal's survival that received the black mulberry leaf or pulp extract. © 2018 Karine de Pádua Lúcio et al.},

abstract={The effects of different Cd concentrations (1, 32 and 64 µM) in absence or presence of exogenously applied ascorbic acid (6 x10 -4 M) in addition to the control on morphogenic response, the antioxidant and nutritional status as well as RAPD-PCR and protein pattern were studied using in vitro cultured nodal segments of tobacco plant. Concentration of Cd within the tissues increased in a concentration dependent manner. Under the highest Cd concentration, no rooting, reduced growth, chlorosis, an antagonistic relation between Fe and Mn and significant reduction in redox state were observed. Translocation of Mn and Zn was facilitated, while that of Fe and Cu was depressed due to Cd. Low Cd+Asc stimulated growth and reduced juvenility. Cd altered hormone homeostasis, meanwhile Asc may regulate auxin action and increased GSH/GSSG ratio. RAPD-banding for 32 µM Cd+Asc treatment manifested the highest number of bands with 14 unique ones accompanied by the highest activity for GR, DHAR and AO; gene up regulation and significant increase in redox state. Addition of Asc initiated rooting under the highest Cd level. Asc/DHA ratio of control plants shifted to sever oxidized state, meanwhile the redox poise of the cell was maintained by high GSH/GSSG ratio. This indicates that DHAR was upregulated upon Cd induction. It was observed that Asc supplemented medium induced direct and indirect organogenesis. Both Cd and Asc altered morphogenic responses of tobacco plants. Therefore, it can be concluded that both Cd and Asc may alter gene expression, via redox controlling, according to the cell milieu. © 2017 @ author (s).},

abstract={Among the heavy metals (HMs), lead (Pb) is considered as a toxic HM which adversely affects growth and development of crop plants. The present experiment was aimed to investigate the potential role of ascorbic acid (ASC) in the reversal of Pb-inhibited nitrogen and sulfur assimilation enzymes activity and activity of photosynthesis enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) and growth response in wheat plants. Wheat seedlings were subjected to 0 mM (control) and 0.2 mM and 0.6 mM of ASC with and without 2 mM of Pb. Plants treated with Pb exhibited the following reduced growth characteristics (root length, shoot length, root fresh weight (FW), shoot FW, root dry weight (DW) and shoot DW). A decrease was also observed in the activity of Rubisco and ATP sulfurylase (ATP-S), relative water content (RWC), accumulation of total chlorophyll (Total Chl) and content of nutrients [nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg)] in Pb-treated plants. However, an increase in Chl degradation and in the activity of O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase (OAS-TL) and accumulation of cysteine (Cys), malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) was observed in plants under Pb stress. On the contrary, exogenous application of ASC mitigated the Pb-toxicity-induced oxidative damage by enhancing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione reductase. Improved activity of antioxidant enzymes suppressed the formation of MDA and H2 O2, which was reflected in the form of improved growth characteristics. Moreover, ASC induced improvement in plants defense systems by reduced Chl degradation and improved the content of essential nutrients (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) and Cys, RWC and the activity of Rubisco, ATP-S, NR and OAS-TL. © 2018, The authors.},

abstract={Experiments were carried out to investigate the role of nitric oxide (NO) in ameliorating the negative effects of cadmium stress in tomato seedlings. Plants treated with cadmium (CdCl2, 150 μM) showed reduced growth, biomass yield, pigment content, chlorophyll fluorescence, and gas exchange parameters. Exogenous application of NO donor (sodium nitroprusside) with nutrient solution protected chlorophyll pigments, restored chlorophyll fluorescence and gas exchange parameters, and caused significant enhancements in growth and biomass yield. Cadmium triggered the synthesis of proline and glycine betaine; however, application of NO caused further enhancement of their accumulation, reflecting an obvious amelioration of the cadmium-induced decline in relative water content. Activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione reductase, monodehydroascorbate reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase, and other enzymatic activities of ascorbate-glutathione cycle were enhanced following the application of NO, as compared with those in untreated seedlings under control and cadmium stress conditions. NO increased the flavonoid and total phenol content in Cd-stressed tomato plants. Moreover, NO application restricted the uptake of cadmium and enhanced the accumulation of nutrients in different parts of tomato plants. On the basis of the findings of the present study, we propose that NO has a potential role as a growth promoter for tomato under cadmium stress. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria.},

abstract={To clarify appropriateness of current claims for health and wellness virtues of argan oil, studies were conducted in inflammatory states. LPS induces inflammation with reduction of PGC1-α signaling and energy metabolism. Argan oil protected the liver against LPS toxicity and interestingly enough preservation of peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase type 1 (ACOX1) activity against depression by LPS. This model of LPS-driven toxicity circumvented by argan oil along with a key anti-inflammatory role attributed to ACOX1 has been here transposed to model aging. This view is consistent with known physiological role of ACOX1 in yielding precursors of specialized proresolving mediators (SPM) and with characteristics of aging and related disorders including reduced PGC1-α function and improvement by strategies rising ACOX1 (via hormonal gut FGF19 and nordihydroguaiaretic acid in metabolic syndrome and diabetes conditions) and SPM (neurodegenerative disorders, atherosclerosis, and stroke). Delay of aging to resolve inflammation results from altered production of SPM, SPM improving most aging disorders. The strategic metabolic place of ACOX1, upstream of SPM biosynthesis, along with ability of ACOX1 preservation/induction and SPM to improve aging-related disorders and known association of aging with drop in ACOX1 and SPM, all converge to conclude that ACOX1 represents a previously unsuspected and currently emerging antiaging protein.

abstract={Background: Essential oils are complex mixtures of low molecular weight compounds extracted from plants. Their main constituents are terpenes and phenylpropanoids, which are responsible for their biological and pharmaceutical properties, such as insecticidal, parasiticidal, antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antinociceptive, anticarcinogenic, and antitumor properties. Cancer is a complex genetic disease considered as a serious public health problem worldwide, accounting for more than 8 million deaths annually. Objective: The activities of prevention and treatment of different types of cancer and the medicinal potential of essential oils are addressed in this review. Conclusion: Several studies have demonstrated anti-carcinogenic and antitumor activity for many essential oils obtained from various plant species. They may be used as a substitution to or in addition to conventional anti-cancer therapy. Although many studies report possible mechanisms of action for essential oils compounds, more studies are necessary in order to apply them safely and appropriately in cancer therapy. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Modern technologies relying on wireless communication systems have brought increasing levels of electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure. This increased research interest in the effects of these radiations on human health. There is compelling evidence that EMFs affect cell physiology by altering redox-related processes. Considering the importance of redox milieu in the biological competence of oocyte and sperm, we reviewed the existing literature regarding the effects of EMFs on reproductive systems. Given the role of mitochondria as the main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), we focused on the hypothesis of a mitochondrial basis of EMF-induced reproductive toxicity. MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus database were examined for peer-reviewed original articles by searching for the following keywords: “extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs),” “radiofrequency (RF),” “microwaves,” “Wi-Fi,” “mobile phone,” “oxidative stress,” “mitochondria,” “fertility,” “sperm,” “testis,” “oocyte,” “ovarian follicle,” and “embryo.” These keywords were combined with other search phrases relevant to the topic. Although we reported contradictory data due to lack of uniformity in the experimental designs, a growing body of evidence suggests that EMF exposure during spermatogenesis induces increased ROS production associated with decreased ROS scavenging activity. Numerous studies revealed the detrimental effects of EMFs from mobile phones, laptops, and other electric devices on sperm quality and provide evidence for extensive electron leakage from the mitochondrial electron transport chain as the main cause of EMF damage. In female reproductive systems, the contribution of oxidative stress to EMF-induced damages and the evidence of mitochondrial origin of ROS overproduction are reported, as well. In conclusion, mitochondria seem to play an important role as source of ROS in both male and female reproductive systems under EMF exposure. Future and more standardized studies are required for a better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying EMF potential challenge to our reproductive system in order to improve preventive strategies.

abstract={The leaves of Pogostemon cablin (Blanco) Benth. (Lamiaceae) are the source of patchouli essential oil, which is – with an annual production of about 1300 tonnes – an important and unique commodity in the fragrance industry. All the literature pertaining to patchouli was critically reviewed with an emphasis on the qualitative and quantitative chemical analysis of the oil but also harvesting, fermentation, drying, distillation, used analytical techniques, sensory aspects including molecules responsible for the odour, adulteration and toxicological aspects, i.e., skin sensitisation, are discussed. In total 72 constituents have been convincingly identified in the oil and another 58 tentatively. The main constituent is the sesquiterpene patchoulol. For this review over 600 papers were consulted and in the supplementary information all patchouli-related references not relevant enough to be cited in the paper itself are listed. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers around the globe and accounts for a large proportion of fatalities in women. Despite the advancement in therapeutic and diagnostic procedures, breast cancer still represents a major challenge. Current anti-breast cancer approaches include surgical removal, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy and the use of various chemotherapeutic drugs. However, drug resistance, associated serious adverse effects, metastasis and recurrence complications still need to be resolved which demand safe and alternative strategies. In this scenario, phytochemicals have recently gained huge attention due to their safety profile and cost-effectiveness. These phytochemicals modulate various genes, gene products and signalling pathways, thereby inhibiting breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis and inducing apoptosis. Moreover, they also target breast cancer stem cells and overcome drug resistance problems in breast carcinomas. Phytochemicals as adjuvants with chemotherapeutic drugs have greatly enhanced their therapeutic efficacy. This review focuses on the recently recognized molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer chemoprevention with the use of phytochemicals such as curcumin, resveratrol, silibinin, genistein, epigallocatechin gallate, secoisolariciresinol, thymoquinone, kaempferol, quercetin, parthenolide, sulforaphane, ginsenosides, naringenin, isoliquiritigenin, luteolin, benzyl isothiocyanate, α-mangostin, 3,3′-diindolylmethane, pterostilbene, vinca alkaloids and apigenin. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={The last decade has seen a sharp increase in the number of scientific publications describing physiological and pathological functions of extracellular vesicles (EVs), a collective term covering various subtypes of cell-released, membranous structures, called exosomes, microvesicles, microparticles, ectosomes, oncosomes, apoptotic bodies, and many other names. However, specific issues arise when working with these entities, whose size and amount often make them difficult to obtain as relatively pure preparations, and to characterize properly. The International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) proposed Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (“MISEV”) guidelines for the field in 2014. We now update these “MISEV2014” guidelines based on evolution of the collective knowledge in the last four years. An important point to consider is that ascribing a specific function to EVs in general, or to subtypes of EVs, requires reporting of specific information beyond mere description of function in a crude, potentially contaminated, and heterogeneous preparation. For example, claims that exosomes are endowed with exquisite and specific activities remain difficult to support experimentally, given our still limited knowledge of their specific molecular machineries of biogenesis and release, as compared with other biophysically similar EVs. The MISEV2018 guidelines include tables and outlines of suggested protocols and steps to follow to document specific EV-associated functional activities. Finally, a checklist is provided with summaries of key points. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

abstract={Research on the biological effects of essential oils on human skin cells is scarce. In the current study, we primarily explored the biological activities of 10 essential oils (nine single and one blend) in a pre-inflamed human dermal fibroblast system that simulated chronic inflammation. We measured levels of proteins critical for inflammation, immune responses, and tissue-remodeling processes. The nine single oils were distilled from Citrus bergamia (bergamot), Coriandrum sativum (cilantro), Pelargonium graveolens (geranium), Helichrysum italicum (helichrysum), Pogostemon cablin (patchouli), Citrus aurantium (petitgrain), Santalum album (sandalwood), Nardostachys jatamansi (spikenard), and Cananga odorata (ylang ylang). The essential oil blend (commercial name Immortelle) is composed of oils from frankincense, Hawaiian sandalwood, lavender, myrrh, helichrysum, and rose. All the studied oils were significantly anti-proliferative against these cells. Furthermore, bergamot, cilantro, and spikenard essential oils primarily inhibited protein molecules related to inflammation, immune responses, and tissue-remodeling processes, suggesting they have anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties. Helichrysum and ylang ylang essential oils, as well as Immortelle primarily inhibited tissue remodeling-related proteins, suggesting a wound healing property. The data are consistent with the results of existing studies examining these oils in other models and suggest that the studied oils may be promising therapeutic candidates. Further research into their biological mechanisms of action is recommended. The differential effects of these essential oils suggest that they exert activities by different mechanisms or pathways, warranting further investigation. The chemical composition of these oils was analyzed using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: The morphological characteristics and 6 kinds of medicinal composition of leaves in Acer truncatum were analyzed to provide the reference for the qualitative and quantitative detection of flavonoids and phenolic compounds, development and utilization of leaf tea, and selection of superior clones in A. truncatum. Method: The morphological indexes of the leaves were determined by conventional methods. The medicinal constituents of the leaves were detected by ultrasonic extraction and HPLC. Result: The variability of leaf morphology was petiole length &gt; leaf lobe width &gt; leaf lobe length &gt; leaf length &gt; leaf width &gt; leaf base angle. The leaf lobe width was mostly 2-3 cm. The leaf base-angle was less than 180°, except for No. 6-1. The average contents of quercetin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, catechin, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid in leaves were 2 979.65, 1 474.92, 268.12, 1 380.18, 218.28 and 8.13 μg·g -1 respectively. The correlation coefficient between the petiole length and the chlorogenic acid content in the leaves was -0.735 * . The correlation coefficient of two tested leaf medicinal materials between mother and its asexual young plants of 'Luhong No.1' was 0.914 * . The flavonoids content of No.6 series were higher than that of the others, while the phenolic content of No. 1 series was higher than that of the others. There were also significant differences of medicinal component content among different families, even different clones in the same family. Conclusion: The indirect selection can be used for breeding leaf supply lines in A. truncatum, for example, the chlorogenic acid content of leaves could be improved by selection of petiole length. The selection of higher medicinal content individuals at young age is feasible because of the positive Juvenile-Mature Correlation of leaf medicinal component content. The significant differences of the leaf medicinal composition among clones in the same family reveal that individual plant selection in the family is also necessary. The line 'Luhong No.1' can be considered as high quality strain resource both for medicinal and ornamental usages due to its larger leaf, higher content of medicinal materials, and the red leaf color in autumn. © 2017, Chinese Academy of Forestry.

abstract={Plant essential oils (EOs) are known to inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi. Whether these antimicrobial effects are comparable to synthetic household products is less clear. Furthermore, limited research is available on the potential additive effect of blending EOs. In this investigation, a new EO blend containing orange, patchouli, peppermint, and clary sage was compared to its individual single oils and to three household products–air freshener, liquid soap, and body spray–for their ability to inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudonomas aeruginosa, and Aspergillus brasiliensis in the disc-diffusion assay. The new EO blend significantly inhibited the growth of the four microorganisms. The zones of inhibition of new EO blend were greater than the air freshener and similar to the liquid soap and body spray, with the exception of Str. pneumoniae in which the body spray provided greater inhibitory zone. The new EO blend and the single oils, with the exception of peppermint, equally inhibited the growth of S. aureus and Str. pneumoniae suggesting no additive effect. P. aeruginosa and A. brasiliensis showed variable susceptibility to all EOs except for no susceptibility to orange and limonene. No difference was found between (−) and (+)-limonene; whereas, (+)-menthol showed greater effect than (−)-menthol. In conclusion, blending the EO of orange, patchouli, peppermint, and clary sage was beneficial in inhibiting the growth of S. aureus, Str. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and A. brasiliensis providing a natural antimicrobial fragrance option over synthetics fragrances used in soaps, body sprays, and air fresheners. © 2017},

abstract={GabR from Bacillus subtilis is a transcriptional regulator belonging to the MocR subfamily of the GntR regulators. The structure of the MocR regulators is characterized by the presence of two domains: i) a N-terminal domain, about 60 residue long, possessing the winged-Helix-Turn-Helix (wHTH) architecture with DNA recognition and binding capability; ii) a C-terminal domain (about 350 residue) folded as the pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) dependent aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) with dimerization and effector binding functions. The two domains are linked to each other by a peptide bridge. Although structural and functional characterization of MocRs is proceeding at a fast pace, virtually nothing is know about the molecular changes induced by the effector binding and on how these modifications influence the properties of the regulator. An extensive molecular dynamics simulation on the crystallographic structure of the homodimeric B. subtilis GabR has been undertaken with the aim to envisage the role and the importance of conformational flexibility in the action of GabR. Molecular dynamics has been calculated for the apo (without PLP) and holo (with PLP bound) forms of the GabR. A comparison between the molecular dynamics trajectories calculated for the two GabR forms suggested that one of the wHTH domain detaches from the AAT-like domain in the GabR PLP-bound form. The most evident conformational change in the holo PLP-bound form is represented by the rotation and the subsequent detachment from the subunit surface of one of the wHTH domains. The movement is mediated by a rearrangement of the linker connecting the AAT domain possibly triggered by the presence of the negative charge of the PLP cofactor. This is the second most significant conformational modification. The C-terminal section of the linker docks into the “active site” pocket and establish stabilizing contacts consisting of hydrogen-bonds, salt-bridges and hydrophobic interactions. © 2017 Milano et al.

abstract={An ideal transgenic gene expression system is inducible, non-leaky, and well tolerated by the target organism. While the former has been satisfactorily realized, leakiness and heavy physiological burden imposed by the existing systems are still prominent hurdles in their successful implementation. Here we describe a new system for non-leaky expression of transgenes in Drosophila. PRExpress is based on a single transgenic construct built from endogenous components, the inducible hsp70 promoter and a multimerized copy of a Polycomb response element (PRE) controlled by epigenetic chromatin regulators of the Polycomb group. We show that this system is non-leaky, rapidly and strongly inducible, and reversible. To make the application of PRExpress user-friendly, we deliver the construct via site-specific integration. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Acetaminophen (APAP) is a readily available and safe painkiller. However, its overdose is the most common cause of acute liver injury (ALI). Many predisposing factors contribute to susceptibility to APAP-induced ALI. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the major cause of chronic liver disease, is considered an important predictor of APAP-induced ALI, although the exact mechanism controversial. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the effects of NAFLD on APAP-induced ALI. Methods: Two groups of mice, normal chow (NC) diet-fed and fast food (FF) diet-fed mice for 14weeks, were further divided into two subgroups: intraperitoneally injected with either saline (NC-S and FF-S groups) or APAP (NC-A and FF-A groups). Biochemical tests, histological analysis, quantitative PCR, and western blotting were conducted. Results: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level (199.0±39.0 vs. 63.8±7.4IU/L, p<0.05) and NAFLD activity score (0 vs. 4.5±0.22) were significantly higher in mice in FF-S group than those in NC-S group. ALI features such as ALT level (8447.8±1185.3 vs. 836.6±185.1IU/L, p<0.001) and centrizonal necrosis were prominent and mRNA levels of Trib3 (RR, 1.81) was high in mice in the NC-A group. Levels of CYP2E1 and anti-inflammatory molecules such as PPAR-γ, p62, and NRF2 were high in mice in the FF-A group. Conclusions: Our results showed that while the FF diet clearly induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and metabolic syndrome, NAFLD also attenuates APAP-induced ALI by inducing anti-inflammatory molecules such as PPAR-γ. © 2017 The Author(s).},

Their use as electron shuttles is demonstrated via an intraelectron transfer chain between neighboring redox units of clustered particles (Dh,DLS = 195 nm) and the mono- and trinuclear Cu sites of bilirubin oxidases. Enhanced current densities for mediated O2 reduction are observed with the redox nanoparticle system compared to equivalent bioelectrode cells with dissolved mediator.

abstract={The aim of this study is to design a novel two-component hybrid scaffold using the fibrin/alginate porous hydrogel Smart Matrix combined to a backing layer of plasma polymerized polydimethylsiloxane (Sil) membrane to make the fibrin-based dermal scaffold more robust for the treatment of the clinically challenging pressure sores. A design criteria are established, according to which the Sil membranes are punched to avoid collection of fluid underneath. Manual peel test shows that native silicone does not attach to the fibrin/alginate component while the plasma polymerized silicone membranes are firmly bound to fibrin/alginate. Structural characterization shows that the fibrin/alginate matrix is intact after the addition of the Sil membrane. By adding a Sil membrane to the original fibrin/alginate scaffold, the resulting two-component scaffolds have a significantly higher shear or storage modulus G′. In vitro cell studies show that dermal fibroblasts remain viable, proliferate, and infiltrate the two-component hybrid scaffolds during the culture period. These results show that the design of a novel two-component hybrid dermal scaffold is successful according to the proposed design criteria. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that reports the combination of a fibrin-based scaffold with a plasma-polymerized silicone membrane. © 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

abstract={Prevention of the metabolic consequences of a chronic energy-dense/high-fat diet (HFD) represents a public health priority. Metformin is a strong candidate to be incorporated in alternative therapeutic approaches. We used a targeted metabolomic approach to assess changes related to the multi-faceted metabolic disturbances provoked by HFD. We evaluated the protective effects of metformin and explored how pro-inflammatory and metabolic changes respond when mice rendered obese, glucose-intolerant and hyperlipidemic were switched to diet reversal with or without metformin. Mice treated with metformin and diet-reversal showed a dramatically improved protection against HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, a beneficial effect that was accompanied by a lowering of liver-infiltrating pro-inflammatory macrophages and lower release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Metformin combined with diet reversal promoted effective weight loss along with better glucose control, lowered levels of circulating cholesterol and triglycerides, and reduced adipose tissue content. Our findings underscored the ability of metformin to target the contribution of branched chain amino acids to adipose tissue metabolism while suppressing mitochondrial-dependent biosynthesis in hepatic tissue. The relationship between adipose tissue and liver might provide clinical potential for combining metformin and dietary modifications to protect against the metabolic damage occurring upon excessive dietary fat intake. © 2017 by the authors.

abstract={Argan oil is widely used in Morocco in traditional medicine. Its ability to treat cardiovascular diseases is well-established. However, nothing is known about its effects on neurodegenerative diseases, which are often associated with increased oxidative stress leading to lipid peroxidation and the formation of 7-ketocholesterol (7KC) resulting from cholesterol auto-oxidation. As 7KC induces oxidative stress, inflammation and cell death, it is important to identify compounds able to impair its harmful effects. These compounds may be either natural or synthetic molecules or mixtures of molecules such as oils. In this context: (i) the lipid profiles of dietary argan oils from Berkane and Agadir (Morocco) in fatty acids, phytosterols, tocopherols and polyphenols were determined by different chromatographic techniques; and (ii) their anti-oxidant and cytoprotective effects in 158N murine oligodendrocytes cultured with 7KC (25-50 μM; 24 h) without and with argan oil (0.1% v/v) or a-tocopherol (400 μM, positive control) were evaluated with complementary techniques of cellular and molecular biology. Among the unsaturated fatty acids present in argan oils, oleate (C18:1 n-9) and linoleate (C18:1 n-6) were the most abundant; the highest quantities of saturated fatty acids were palmitate (C16:0) and stearate (C18:0). Several phytosterols were found, mainly schottenol and spinasterol (specific to argan oil), cycloartenol, β-amyrin and citrostadienol. α- and γ-tocopherols were also present. Tyrosol and protocatechic acid were the only polyphenols detected. Argan and extra virgin olive oils have many compounds in common, principally oleate and linoleate, and tocopherols. Kit Radicaux Libres (KRL) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) tests showed that argan and extra virgin olive oils have anti-oxidant properties. Argan oils were able to attenuate the cytotoxic effects of 7KC on 158N cells: loss of cell adhesion, cell growth inhibition, increased plasma membrane permeability, mitochondrial, peroxisomal and lysosomal dysfunction, and the induction of oxiapoptophagy (OXIdation + APOPTOsis + autoPHAGY). Altogether, our data obtained in 158N oligodendrocytes provide evidence that argan oil is able to counteract the toxic effects of 7KC on nerve cells, thus suggesting that some of its compounds could prevent or mitigate neurodegenerative diseases to the extent that they are able to cross the blood-brain barrier. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Sepsis causes severe dysregulation of organ functions, via the development of oxidative stress and inflammation. These pathophysiological mechanisms are mimicked in mice injected with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Here, protective properties of argan oil against LPS-induced oxidative stress and inflammation are explored in the murine model. Mice received standard chow, supplemented with argan oil (AO) or olive oil (OO) for 25 days, before septic shock was provoked with a single intraperitoneal injection of LPS, 16 hours prior to animal sacrifice. In addition to a rise in oxidative stress and inflammatory markers, injected LPS also caused hepatotoxicity, accompanied by hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia and hyperuremia. These LPS-associated toxic effects were blunted by AO pretreatment, as corroborated by normal plasma parameters and cell stress markers (glutathione: GSH) and antioxidant enzymology (catalase, CAT; superoxide dismutase, SOD and glutathione peroxidase, GPx). Hematoxylin–eosin staining revealed that AO can protect against acute liver injury, maintaining a normal status, which is pointed out by absent or reduced LPS-induced hepatic damage markers (i.e., alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST)). Our work also indicated that AO displayed anti-inflammatory activity, due to down-regulations of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) and in up-regulations of the expression of anti-inflammatory genes encoding Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and Interleukin-10 (IL-10). OO provided animals with similar, though less extensive, protective changes. Collectively our work adds compelling evidence to the protective mechanisms of AO against LPS-induced liver injury and hence therapeutic potentialities, in regard to the management of human sepsis. Activations of IL-4/Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (IL-4/PPARs) signaling and, under LPS, an anti-inflammatory IL-10/Liver X Receptor (IL-10/LXR) route, obviously indicated the high potency and plasticity of the anti-inflammatory properties of argan oil. © 2017 by the author.

abstract={This study aimed to evaluate the histopathological changes in the aorta and kidneys of mice age of menopause by the ethanol extract of ylang-ylang (Cananga odorata) flowers. Thirty female age of menopause mice was divided into three groups (n = 10 each group), consisting of a group of mice the age of menopause without any treatment, mice age of menopause treated with different dosages of ylang-ylang flower extract (0.1 mg/day and 0.2 mg/day). Histopathological analysis was performed with hematoxylin-eosin staining. The number of endothelial cells and the thickness of the intima in the group treated with high dose of the extract were significantly higher than the lowest dose of the extract or the control group (p < 0.05). The diameter of the Bowman's capsule and the renal glomerulus was significantly higher in the group treated with ylang-ylang flower extract compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Concluded that at the doses administered, ylang flower extract triggers the repair of endothelial cells, but increase the thickness of the intima and hyperplasia of the kidney in mice age of menopause. Thus, ylang flower extract and renal vascular remodeling triggered by the age of menopause. © 2017},

abstract={Fructose-rich caloric sweeteners induce adverse changes in the metabolism of humans. The study evaluated the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on a fructose feeding model, focusing on the liver, white adipose tissue (WAT), skeletal muscle, and their interplay. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed for 18 wk one of the following diets: control (C; 5% of total energy from fructose) or fructose (F; 55% of total energy from fructose). In the 10th week, for an additional 8-wk period, the groups were divided into nontrained (NT) or HIIT groups, totaling four groups: C-NT, C-HIIT, F-NT, and F-HIIT. At the end of the experiment, fructose consumption in the F-NT group led to a high systolic blood pressure, high plasma triglycerides, insulin resistance with glucose intolerance, and lower insulin sensitivity. We also observed liver steatosis, adipocyte hypertrophy, and diminished gene expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-± coactivator 1-< and fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (FNDC5; irisin) in this F-NT group. These results were accompanied by decreased gene expressions of nuclear respiratory factor 1 and mitochondrial transcription factor A (markers of mitochondrial biogenesis), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-< and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (markers of ∼-oxidation). HIIT improved all of these data in the C-HIIT and F-HIIT groups. In conclusion, in mice fed a fructose diet, HIIT improved body mass, blood pressure, glucose metabolism, and plasma triglycerides. Liver, WAT, and skeletal muscle were positively modulated by HIIT, indicating HIIT as a coadjutant treatment for diseases affecting these tissues. NEW &NOTEWORTHY We investigated the effects of highintensity interval training (HIIT) in mice fed a fructose-rich diet and the resulting severe negative effect on the liver, white adipose tissue (WAT), and skeletal muscle, which reduced the expression of fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (FNDC5, irisin) and PGC1< and, consequently, affected markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and ∼-oxidation. Because HIIT may block these adverse effects in all of these three tissues, it might be suggested that it functions as a coadjutant treatment in combatting the alterations caused by highfructose intake. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={The drift kinetic energy of ionic flow through single ion channels cause vibrations of the pore walls which are observed as open-state current fluctuations (open-channel noise) during single-channel recordings. Vibration of the pore wall leads to transitions among different conformational sub-states of the channel protein in the open-state. Open-channel noise analysis can provide important information about the different conformational sub-state transitions and how biochemical modifications of ion channels would affect their transport properties. It has been shown that c-Jun N-terminal kinase-3 (JNK3) becomes activated by phosphorylation in various neurodegenerative diseases and phosphorylates outer mitochondrion associated proteins leading to neuronal apoptosis. In our earlier work, JNK3 has been reported to phosphorylate purified rat brain mitochondrial voltage–dependent anion channel (VDAC) in vitro and modify its conductance and opening probability. In this article we have compared the open-state noise profile of the native and the JNK3 phosphorylated VDAC using Power Spectral Density vs frequency plots. Power spectral density analysis of open-state noise indicated power law with average slope value α ≈1 for native VDAC at both positive and negative voltage whereas average α value &lt; 0.5 for JNK3 phosphorylated VDAC at both positive and negative voltage. It is proposed that 1/f1 power law in native VDAC open-state noise arises due to coupling of ionic transport and conformational sub-states transitions in open-state and this coupling is perturbed as a result of channel phosphorylation. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={In this study, we showed that the dual addition of glucosyl ceramide synthase and ceramidase inhibitors to A549 cell culture led to the possibility of ceramide channel formation via endogenous palmitoyl-ceramide accumulation with an increase in cholesterol contents in the lysosome membrane as an initial step prior to initiation of necrotic cell death. In addition, the dual addition led to black circular structures of 10–20 nm, interpreted as stain-filled cylindrical channels on transmission electron microscopy. The formation of palmitoyl-ceramide channels in the lysosome membrane causes the liberation of cathepsin B from lysosomes for necrotic cell death. On the other hand, necrotic cell death in the dual addition was not caused by oxidative stress or cathepsin B activity, and the cell death was free from the contribution of the translation of Bax protein to the lysosome membrane. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Seeds of Crotalaria retusa L. are used in popular medicine because of their pharmacological properties. The albumin fraction obtained from its seeds contains lectin, a protein known to have analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, albumins extracted from C. retusa were investigated for their anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects. The intraperitoneal administration of different doses of albumins (5, 10 or 20 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the mice paw edema induced by carrageenan (maximum inhibition rate of 80.9% at four hours, 20 mg/kg), and this event was followed by diminishing paw myeloperoxidase measurements. Albumins (20 mg/kg) also inhibited neutrophil migration into the peritoneal cavity induced by carrageenan. However, no effect was observed in the dextran-induced paw edema and abdominal contortions induced by acetic acid. Moreover, albumins (20 mg/kg) significantly reduced the second (inflammatory) phase of the licking time induced by formalin. The detection of heammaglutinating activity against human erythrocytes in albumins evidences the presence of lectin in seeds of C. retusa. Our data showed that seeds of C. retusa had anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive properties and such activities are probably due to the inhibitory effect on neutrophil migration of lectin present in albumins. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Trunk disease fungi are a global problem affecting many economically important fruiting trees. The Botryosphaeriaceae are a family of trunk disease fungi that require detailed biochemical characterization in order to gain insight into their pathogenicity. The application of a modified Folch extraction to protein extraction from the Botryosphaeriaceae Lasiodiplodia theobromae generated an unprecedented data set of protein identifications from fragmentation analysis and de novo peptide sequencing of its proteome. This article contains data from protein identifications obtained from a database-dependent fragmentation analysis using three different proteomics algorithms (MSGF, Comet and X! Tandem via the SearchGUI proteomics pipeline program) and de novo peptide sequencing. Included are data sets of gene ontology annotations using an all-Uniprot ontology database, as well as a Saccharomyces cerevisiae-only and a Candida albicans-only ontology database, in order to discern between those proteins involved in common functions with S. cerevisiae and those in common with the pathogenic yeast C. albicans. Our results reveal the proteome of L. theobromae contains more ontological categories in common to C. albicans, yet possesses a much wider metabolic repertoire than any of the yeasts studied in this work. Many novel proteins of interest were identified for further biochemical characterization and annotation efforts, as further discussed in the article referencing this article (1). Interactive Cytoscape networks of molecular functions of identified peptides using an all-Uniprot ontological database are included.

abstract={Introduction: Tamoxifen, as an essential therapeutic tool in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, has been available for the past three decades and is currently being utilized as a chemo-preventive agent for patients at high risk for breast carcinoma. However, the induction of chemo-resistance during therapy has indicated a significant challenge with regards to this agent. Areas covered: This review enumerates the role of MUC1-C proto-oncogene in tamoxifen resistance and describes a number of signaling pathways by which MUC1-C would mediate the development of resistance. Finally, recent clinical studies conducted on the magnitude of MUC1 in inducing tamoxifen resistance are described. Expert commentary: Mucin 1, or MUC1, is aberrantly overexpressed on the entire tumor cell surface of most human cancers. Thus, it may result in the upregulation of several signaling pathways, such as growth cascades related to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), β-catenin and E-cadherin, as well as promoting gene transcription of Ras-related protein Rab-31 in order to mediate tumor growth control in response to tamoxifen. On the contrary, MUC1 suppresses apoptotic events, which in turn impresses upon cell fate. Also, it has been demonstrated that silencing MUC1-C proto-oncogene is associated with increased sensitivity to tamoxifen-induced growth inhibitors. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The effect of cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) bark essential oil (CBEO) on human skin cells has not been elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the activity of a commercially available CBEO in a validated human dermal fibroblast system, a model of chronic inflammation and fibrosis. We first evaluated the impact of CBEO on 17 protein biomarkers that play critical roles in inflammation and tissue remodeling. The impact of CBEO on genome-wide gene expression was also evaluated. CBEO showed strong anti-proliferative effects on skin cells and significantly inhibited the production of several inflammatory biomarkers, including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interferon gamma-induced protein 10, interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant, and monokine induced by gamma interferon. In addition, CBEO significantly inhibited the production of several tissue remodeling molecules, including epidermal growth factor receptor, matrix metalloproteinase-1, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor, which is an immunomodulatory protein molecule, was also significantly inhibited by CBEO. Furthermore, CBEO significantly modulated global gene expression and altered signaling pathways, many of which are important in inflammation, tissue remodeling, and cancer biology. The study shows that CBEO is a promising antiinflammatory agent; however, further research is required to clarify its clinical efficacy. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Pollution due to heavy metal(loid)s has become common menace across the globe. This is due to unprecedented frequent geological changes coupled with increasing anthropogenic activities, and population growth rate. Heavy metals (HMs) presence in the soil causes toxicity, and hampers plant growth and development. Plants being sessile are exposed to a variety of stress and/or a network of different kinds of stresses throughout their life cycle. To sense and transduce these stress signal, the signal reactive nitrogen species (RNS) particularly nitric oxide (NO) is an important secondary messenger next to only reactive oxygen species (ROS). Nitric oxide, a redox active molecule, colourless simple gas, and being a free radical (NO[rad]) has the potential in regulating multiple biological signaling responses in a variety of plants. Nitric oxide can counteract HMs-induced ROS, either by direct scavenging or by stimulating antioxidants defense team; therefore, it is also known as secondary antioxidant. The imbalance or cross talk of/between NO and ROS concentration along with antioxidant system leads to nitrosative and oxidative stress, or combination of both i.e., nitro-oxidative stress. Endogenous synthesis of NO also takes place in plants in the presence of heavy metals. During HM stress the different organelles of plant cells can biosynthesize NO in parallel to the ROS, such as in mitochondria, chloroplasts, peroxisomes, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum and apoplasts. In view of the above, an effort has been made in the present review article to trace current knowledge and latest advances in chemical properties, biological roles, mechanism of NO action along with the physiological, biochemical, and molecular changes that occur in plants under different metal stress. A brief focus is also carried on ROS properties, roles, and their production. © 2017},

abstract={The use of oregano (Origanum vulgare) essential oil (OEO) has become popular in skin care products. However, scientific research regarding its effects on human skin cells is scarce. In this study, we investigated the biological activity of a commercially available OEO, which is high in carvacrol content, in a human skin cell disease model. OEO induced marked antiproliferative effects and significantly inhibited several inflammatory biomarkers, including monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), intracellular cell adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC), and monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG). OEO also significantly inhibited tissue remodeling biomarkers, namely collagen I, collagen III, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) 1 and 2. An immunomodulatory biomarker, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), was also strongly inhibited by OEO treatment. In addition, OEO significantly modulated global gene expression and altered signaling pathways, many of which are critical in inflammation, tissue remodeling, and cancer signaling processes. These findings along with existing studies largely support the anti-inflammatory, tissue remodeling, immunomodulatory, and anticancer activities of OEO. In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence of the biological activity of OEO in human dermal fibroblasts. We suggest that OEO, with carvacrol as the major active component, is a promising candidate for use in skin care products with anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Arborvitae (Thuja plicata) essential oil (AEO) is becoming increasingly popular in skincare, although its biological activity in human skin cells has not been investigated. Therefore, we sought to study AEO's effect on 17 important protein biomarkers that are closely related to inflammation and tissue remodeling by using a pre-inflamed human dermal fibroblast culture model. AEO significantly inhibited the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), intracellular cell adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), interferon-inducible T-cell chemoattractant (I-TAC), monokine induced by interferon gamma (MIG), and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). It also showed significant antiproliferative activity and robustly inhibited collagen-I, collagen-III, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 and 2 (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2). The inhibitory effect of AEO on increased production of these protein biomarkers suggests it has anti-inflammatory property. We then studied the effect of AEO on the genome-wide expression of 21,224 genes in the same cell culture. AEO significantly and diversely modulated global gene expression. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) showed that AEO robustly affected numerous critical genes and signaling pathways closely involved in inflammatory and tissue remodeling processes. The findings of this study provide the first evidence of the biological activity and beneficial action of AEO in human skin cells. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Although frankincense essential oil (FREO) has become increasingly popular in skin care, research on its biological activities in human skin cells is scarce, if not completely absent. In the current study, we explored the biological activities of FREO in pre-inflamed human dermal fibroblasts by analyzing the levels of 17 important protein biomarkers pertinent to inflammation and tissue remodeling. FREO exhibited robust anti-proliferative activity in these skin cells. It also significantly inhibited collagen III, interferon gamma-induced protein 10, and intracellular cell adhesion molecule 1. We also studied its effect in regulating genome-wide gene expression. FREO robustly modulated global gene expression. Furthermore, Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis showed that FREO affected many important signaling pathways that are closely related to inflammation, immune response, and tissue remodeling. This study provides the first evidence of the biological activities of FREO in human dermal fibroblasts. Consistent with existing studies in other models, the current study suggests that FREO possesses promising potential to modulate the biological processes of inflammation and tissue remodeling in human skin. Further research into the biological mechanisms of action of FREO and its major active components is recommended. © 2017 The Author(s)},

abstract={There is a constant need for better stroke treatments. Neurons at the periphery of an ischemic stroke affected brain tissue remains metabolically active for several hours or days after stroke onset. They later undergo mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis. It has been found that inhibiting apoptosis in the peripheral ischemic neurons could be very effective in the prevention of stroke progression. During stroke associated apoptosis, cytosolic c-Jun N-terminal Kinases (JNKs) and Bcl-2 family proteins translocate towards mitochondria and promote cytochrome c release by interacting with the outer mitochondrion membrane associated proteins. This review provides an overview of the plausible interactions of the outer mitochondrial membrane Voltage Dependent Anion Channel, Bcl-2 family proteins and JNKs in cytochrome c release in the peripheral ischemic stroke associated apoptotic neurons. The review ends with a note on designing new anti-stroke treatments. © 2017 The Author(s)},

abstract={Fasted or weight-category athletes manage their training under strict diet conditions that could impair the stress-recovery balance and result in acute or chronic fatigue. However, to date, no validated biomarker are available to quantify this phenomena. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of a specific index combining plasma albumin and weight change to detect nutrition-related risks of fatigue increase and under-performance in athletes experiencing particular nutritional conditions. An athlete's nutrition risk index (ANRI) equation, based on data from lightweight and heavyweight rowers, was developed using relationship between plasma albumin concentrations combined to weight changes with sport performance and overtraining scores and was tested by odds ratio for failure. The accuracy and sensitivity of this former specific equation was subsequently tested on runners observing the Ramadan-fasting as well as on boxers after a short weight-loss period. Independently of training and performance, lightweight rowers presented lower nutritional parameters than heavyweight (albumin: 37.4 ± 2.7 vs 39.9 ± 1.8 g·L −1 , P &lt; 0.05; weight state: 94.5 ± 1.8 vs 99.9 ± 0.9%, P &lt; 0.01). In lightweight, ANRI was related with overtraining score (R 2  = 0.21, P &lt; 0.01), risks for failure in competition were enhanced when ANRI increased (OR:2.5, P = 0.03). Relationship of ANRI with overtraining score tended to be also significant in runners (R 2  = 0.32, P = 0.06) but not in boxers (P = 0.4). Albumin concentrations combined to weight loss appeared relevant to delineate nutrition-related risks of fatigue and/or competitive failure associated with mid-term diets (about 30 days) as observed in rowers and Ramadan-fasted runners. ANRI may benefit to athletes monitoring by delineating effects of their weight loss program. © 2016 The Author(s)},

abstract={Colobanthus quitensis is a species with a wide geographical distribution, including Antarctica. This species must endure a series of limiting abiotic factors in its habitats, such as, high metal ion concentrations. It has been described to inhabit areas where only metal-tolerant species can live. Therefore, it is postulated that the study of this species may provide information about copper tolerance mechanisms. We evaluated the effect of copper (II) ions (control, 100 and 500 µM) on C. quitensis seedlings in vitro, determining morpho-physiological and biochemical variables. Copper showed a significantly negative effect on the development of new shoots (500 µM) and floral apex appearance (100 µM). The analyzed Cu concentrations significantly affected leaf and root length and induced a significant increase in guaiacol peroxidase (G-POD) enzyme activity. The highest proline accumulation took place in seedlings subjected to 500 µM. Furthermore, this concentration induced a significant reduction in chlorophyll a content and exhibited oxidative stress evaluated through an increase in malondialde-hyde levels. This is the first study to demonstrate evidence of copper effects on morphological, physiological and biochemical variables in C. quitensis. © 2017, Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo.

abstract={Background: The wheat cyclophilin, TaCYPA-1, shows peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity. However, the significance of different cysteine residues in regulation of PPIase activity of this protein has not been investigated. Objectives: The main objective of this study was to analyze the role of different disulphide linkages in redox mechanisms that modulate the PPIase activity of TaCYPA-1. Method: Site-directed mutants of TaCYPA-1 were generated by substituting cysteine residues at positions -40 and -122 with serine and -126 with proline. The recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The effect of Cu2+ and N-ethylmaleimide was studied on PPIase activity of the purified recombinant cyclophilins for analyzing the role of different cysteine residues in the modulation of enzyme activity. The changes in secondary structure of TaCYPA-1 and its mutants were analysed by recording far UV CD spectra. The effect of different cysteine substitutions on thermotolerance of E. coli was studied by monitoring the cell growth at 47 °C after 2 h, 3 h and 5 h of heat stress. Results: The catalytic efficiencies (Kcat/Km) of TaCYPA-1C40S (0.37 X 106 M-1 s-1) and TaCYPA-1C122S (0.31 X 106 M-1 s-1) were significantly lower as compared to the native TaCYPA-1 (1.33 X 106 M-1 s-1), whereas Kcat/Km of the double mutant TaCYPA-1C40S/C122S was significantly higher (2.36 X 106 M-1 s-1). Compared to the wild-type TaCYPA-1, the different mutants also showed differential sensitivity to Cu2+. Furthermore, the results of this study also revealed that despite lacking PPIase activity, the mutant TaCYPA-1C126P was able to confer partial protection against heat stress. Conclusion: This study revealed that mutation of different cysteine residues in TaCYPA-1 results in differential effect on PPIase activity. It was also observed that of the two pairs of cysteine residues i.e. Cys40/Cys168 and Cys122/Cys126, the latter appears to play major role in redox regulation of TaCYPA-1. The mutant TaCYPA-1C126P, though lacking PPIase activity, was able to impart partial tolerance to heat stress in E. coli, suggesting other functions besides cis to trans isomerisation.

abstract={In humans the steroid 5α-reductase (SRD5A) family comprises five integral membrane enzymes that carry out reduction of a double bond in lipidic substrates: Δ4-3-keto steroids, polyprenol and trans-enoyl CoA. The best-characterized reaction is the conversion of testosterone into the more potent dihydrotestosterone carried out by SRD5A1-2. Some controversy exists on their possible nuclear or endoplasmic reticulum localization. We report the cloning and transient expression in HeLa cells of the five members of the human steroid 5α-reductase family as both N- and C-terminus green fluorescent protein tagged protein constructs. Following the intrinsic fluorescence of the tag, we have determined that the subcellular localization of these enzymes is in the endoplasmic reticulum, upon expression in HeLa cells. The presence of the tag at either end of the polypeptide chain can affect protein expression and, in the case of trans enoyl-CoA reductase, it induces the formation of protein aggregates. © 2017},

abstract={MDCK cells are widely used to study the differential targeting of membrane transporters to apical and basolateral membrane but its canine origin limited the commercial tools available for the analysis of protein trafficking machinery. Because apical and basolateral membranes are only found in differentiated epithelial cells, genes critical for differential targeting may be specifically up-regulated upon MDCK cell differentiation. To search for these genes, a cross-species screening strategy was used. We first analyzed the human microarray data for protein trafficking-related genes that were up-regulated in colon carcinoma Caco2 cells upon differentiation. The results of mouse 44K gene expression microarray analysis were then used to extract additional candidate genes that showed higher expression in normal colon epithelium compared to primary embryonic fibroblasts. Finally, NCBI genomic sequence information was used to design RT-PCR primers for 13 candidate and 10 negative control genes and used to analyze MDCK cells at 2, 13 and 17 days after seeding. To determine whether the gene up-regulation was specific in epithelial differentiation, we also performed RT-PCR on rat non-differentiating intestinal IEC-6 cells and mouse C2C12 cells, a differentiating myoblast model. Of the 13 candidate genes, 3 genes, SDCBP2, KIF12, KIF27, met all criteria of specific up-regulation in differentiated MDCK cells. In addition, KIF13A showed up-regulation in differentiated MDCK and C2C12 cells but not in IEC-6 cells cultured for the same duration. The functions of these genes need to be analyzed in the future. This cross-species screening strategy may be useful for other non-human, non-rodent cell models. © 2017 The Author(s)},

abstract={Bax is a pro-apoptotic cytosolic protein. In this work native (unphosphorylated) and JNK3 phosphorylated Bax proteins are studied on artificial bilayer membranes for pore formation. Phosphorylated Bax formed pore on the bilayer lipid membrane whereas native one does not. In cells undergoing apoptosis the pore formed by the phosphorylated Bax could be important in cytochrome c release from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytosol. The low conductance (1.5 nS) of the open state of the phosphorylated Bax pore corresponds to pore diameter of 0.9 nm which is small to release cytochrome c (∼3.4 nm). We hypothesized that JNK3 phosphorylated Bax protein can form bigger pores after forming complexes with other mitochondrial proteins like VDAC, t-Bid etc. to release cytochrome c. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Studies show that the continuous consumption of fructose can lead to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis. We aimed to investigate the role of Metformin in an animal model of liver injury caused by fructose intake, focusing on the molecular markers of lipogenesis, beta-oxidation, and antioxidant defenses. Male three months old C57BL/6 mice were divided into control group (C) and fructose group (F, 47% fructose), maintained for ten weeks. After, the groups received Metformin or vehicle for a further eight weeks: control (C), control + Metformin (CM), fructose (F), and fructose + Metformin (FM). Fructose resulted in hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance and lower insulin sensitivity in association with higher mRNA levels of proteins linked with de novo lipogenesis and increased lipid peroxidation. Fructose diminished mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes, and of proteins responsible for mitochondrial biogenesis. Metformin reduced de novo lipogenesis and increased the expression of proteins related to mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby increasing beta-oxidation and decreasing lipid peroxidation. Also, Metformin upregulated the expression and activity of antioxidant enzymes, providing a defense against increased reactive oxygen species generation. Therefore, a significant reduction in triglyceride accumulation in the liver, steatosis and lipid peroxidation was observed in the FM group. In conclusion, fructose increases de novo lipogenesis, reduces the antioxidant defenses, and diminishes mitochondrial biogenesis. After an extended period of fructose intake, Metformin treatment, even in continuing the fructose intake, can reverse, at least partially, the liver injury and prevents NAFLD progression to more severe states. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Exosomes are 40–100 nm nanovesicles containing RNA and different proteins. Exosomes containing proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and microRNAs are important in intracellular communication and immune function. Exosomes from different sources are usually obtained by combination of centrifugation and ultracentrifugation and according to published data can contain from a few dozens to thousands of different proteins. Crude exosome preparations from milk of eighteen horses were obtained for the first time using several standard centrifugations. Exosome preparations were additionally purified by FPLC gel filtration. Individual preparations demonstrated different profiles of gel filtration showing well or bad separation of exosome peaks and one or two peaks of co-isolating proteins and their complexes. According to the electron microscopy, well purified exosomes displayed a typical exosome-like size (30–100 nm) and morphology. It was shown that exosomes may have several different biological functions, but detection of their biological functions may vary significantly depending on the presence of exosome contaminating proteins and proteins directly into exosomes. Exosome proteins were identified before and after gel filtration by MALDI MS and MS/MS spectrometry of protein tryptic hydrolyzates derived by SDS PAGE and 2D electrophoresis. The results of protein identification were unexpected: one or two peaks co-isolating proteins after gel-filtration mainly contained kappa-, beta-, alpha-S1-caseins and its precursors, but these proteins were not found in well-purified exosomes. Well-purified exosomes contained from five to eight different major proteins: CD81, CD63 receptors, beta-lactoglobulin and lactadherin were common to all preparations, while actin, butyrophilin, lactoferrin, and xanthine dehydrogenase were found only in some of them. The article describes the morphology and the protein content of major horse milk exosomes for the first time. Our results on the decrease of major protein number identified in exosomal preparations after gel filtration may be important to the studies of biological functions of pure exosomes. © 2017 The Author(s)},

abstract={The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of endurance training with and without vitamin E on the expression of p53 and Phosphatase and tension homolog (PTEN) tumor suppressor genes of prostate glands in male rats. For this purpose, 50 Sprague–Dawley male rats were randomly assigned into 5 groups: (1) control group (CON, n = 10), (2) sham (S, n = 10), (3) endurance training (ET, n = 10), (4) endurance training + vitamin E (ET + VE, n = 10), (5) vitamin E (VE, n = 10). Endurance training protocol was implemented for 6 weeks, 6 days per week, in accordance with the overload principle. To measure expression changes of p53 and PTEN genes in rats' prostate, real-time PCR method was used and HPLC method was used to measure vitamin E in this tissue. After 6 weeks of taking vitamin E, its level in all groups, except for group VE (p < 0.000) did not significantly increase. After implementing training protocol, p53 expression reduced significantly in ET group (p < 0.026). Vitamin E supplementation along with endurance training did not cause any significant change either p53 or PTEN (respectively; p < 0.2, p < 0.11). Instead, vitamin E supplementation without endurance training caused significant increase in PTEN, but did not cause any significant changes in p53 (respectively; p < 0.016, p < 0.15). These results indicate that endurance training reduces p53 and PTEN tumor suppressing genes expression, and taking vitamin E supplement could increase expression of these genes in some extent. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Many basic science questions remain regarding protein functions in the pathogen: host interaction, especially in the trunk disease fungi family, the Botryosphaeriaceae, which are a global problem for economically important plants, especially fruiting trees. Proteomics is a highly useful technology for studying protein expression and for discovering novel proteins in unsequenced and poorly annotated organisms. Current fungal proteomics approaches involve 2D SDS-PAGE and extensive, complex, protein extraction methodologies. In this work, a modified Folch extraction was applied to protein extraction to perform both de novo peptide sequencing and peptide fragmentation analysis/protein identification of the plant and human fungal pathogen Lasiodiplodia theobromae. Both bioinformatics approaches yielded novel peptide sequences from proteins produced by L. theobromae in the presence of exogenous triglycerides and glucose. These proteins and the functions they may possess could be targeted for further functional characterization and validation efforts, due to their potential uses in biotechnology and as new paradigms for understanding fungal biochemistry, such as the finding of allergenic enolases, as well as various novel proteases, including zinc metalloproteinases homologous to those found in snake venom. This work contributes to genomic annotation efforts, which, hand in hand with genomic sequencing, will help improve fungal bioinformatics databases for future studies of Botryosphaeriaceae. All data, including raw data, are available via the ProteomeXchange data repository with identifier PXD005283. This is the first study of its kind in Botryosphaeriaceae. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={One of the most commonly used sweeteners is fructose. Fructose is directly metabolized in the liver and can be converted into glucose, later stored as glycogen constituting a source of energy for the hepatocytes. All excess fructose is converted into lipids by exerting a toxic effect on the liver, similar to that produced by excess of alcohol, and can cause nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD). The aim of this review is to gather recent findings regarding the effect of fructose intake at high concentrations and its relationship with NAFLD. © 2017, Universidad de la Frontera.

abstract={Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a significant component of the microenvironment of any solid tumors in the majority of cancers, associated with unfavorable prognosis. TAMs emerge as attractive targets for therapeutic strategies aimed at reprogramming their protumor phenotype into an effective antitumor activity. In this review article, we present an overview of mechanisms responsible for TAMs recruitment and highlight the roles of TAMs in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis, immunosuppression, and chemotherapeutic resistance. We describe the interplay between Th17 cells and other immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, and we assess both the potential antitumorigenic and pro-tumorigenic activities of Th17 cells and their associated cytokines. Understanding the nature of Th17 cell responses in the tumor microenvironment will be important for the design of more efficacious cancer immunotherapies. Finally, we discuss TAM-targeting therapy as a promising novel strategy for an indirect cancer therapy. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Obesity is an ongoing pandemic and serves as a causal factor of a wide spectrum of metabolic diseases including diabetes, fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular disease. Much evidence has demonstrated that nutrient overload/overnutrition initiates or exacerbates inflammatory responses in tissues/organs involved in the regulation of systemic metabolic homeostasis. This obesity-associated inflammation is usually at a lowgrade and viewed as metabolic inflammation. When it exists continuously, inflammation inappropriately alters metabolic pathways and impairs insulin signaling cascades in peripheral tissues/organs such as adipose tissue, the liver and skeletal muscles, resulting in local fat deposition and insulin resistance and systemic metabolic dysregulation. In addition, inflammatory mediators, e.g., proinflammatory cytokines, and excessive nutrients, e.g., glucose and fatty acids, act together to aggravate local insulin resistance and form a vicious cycle to further disturb the local metabolic pathways and exacerbate systemic metabolic dysregulation. Owing to the critical role of nutrient metabolism in controlling the initiation and progression of inflammation and insulin resistance, nutritional approaches have been implicated as effective tools for managing obesity and obesity-associated metabolic diseases. Based on the mounting evidence generated from both basic and clinical research, nutritional approaches are commonly used for suppressing inflammation, improving insulin sensitivity, and/or decreasing fat deposition. Consequently, the combined effects are responsible for improvement of systemic insulin sensitivity and metabolic homeostasis. © 2017 The authors.},

abstract={Jatropha curcas is an oilseed species that is considered an excellent alternative energy source for fossil-based fuels for growing in arid and semiarid regions, where salinity is becoming a stringent problem to crop production. Our working hypothesis was that nitric oxide (NO) priming enhances salt tolerance of J. curcas during early seedling development. Under NaCl stress, seedlings arising from NO-treated seeds showed lower accumulation of Na+ and Cl− than those salinized seedlings only, which was consistent with a better growth for all analyzed time points. Also, although salinity promoted a significant increase in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content and membrane damage, the harmful effects were less aggressive in NO-primed seedlings. The lower oxidative damage in NO-primed stressed seedlings was attributed to operation of a powerful antioxidant system, including greater glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate (AsA) contents as well as catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) enzyme activities in both endosperm and embryo axis. Priming with NO also was found to rapidly up-regulate the JcCAT1, JcCAT2, JcGR1 and JcGR2 gene expression in embryo axis, suggesting that NO-induced salt responses include functional and transcriptional regulations. Thus, NO almost completely abolished the deleterious salinity effects on reserve mobilization and seedling growth. In conclusion, NO priming improves salt tolerance of J. curcas during seedling establishment by inducing an effective antioxidant system and limiting toxic ion and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH},

abstract={Water deprivation of the Spinifex hopping mouse, Notomys alexis, induced a biphasic pattern of food intake with an initial hypophagia that was followed by an increased, and then sustained food intake. The mice lost approximately 20% of their body mass and there was a loss of white adipose tissue. Stomach ghrelin mRNA was significantly higher at day 2 of water deprivation but then returned to the same levels as water-replete (day 0) mice for the duration of the experiment. Plasma ghrelin was unaffected by water deprivation except at day 10 where it was significantly increased. Plasma leptin levels decreased at day 2 and day 5 of water deprivation, and then increased significantly by the end of the water deprivation period. Water deprivation caused a significant decrease in skeletal muscle leptin mRNA expression at days 2 and 5, but then it returned to day 0 levels by day 29. In the hypothalamus, water deprivation caused a significant up-regulation in both ghrelin and neuropeptide Y mRNA expression, respectively. In contrast, hypothalamic GHSR1a mRNA expression was significantly down-regulated. A significant increase in LepRb mRNA expression was observed at days 17 and 29 of water deprivation. This study demonstrated that the sustained food intake in N. alexis during water deprivation was uncoupled from peripheral appetite-regulating signals, and that the hypothalamus appears to play an important role in regulating food intake; this may contribute to the maintenance of fluid balance in the absence of free water. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={During the last few years, the understanding of the dysregulated hydrogen ion dynamics and reversed proton gradient of cancer cells has resulted in a new and integral pH-centric paradigm in oncology, a translational model embracing from cancer etiopathogenesis to treatment. The abnormalities of intracellular alkalinization along with extracellular acidification of all types of solid tumors and leukemic cells have never been described in any other disease and now appear to be a specific hallmark of malignancy. As a consequence of this intracellular acid-base homeostatic failure, the attempt to induce cellular acidification using proton transport inhibitors and other intracellular acidifiers of different origins is becoming a new therapeutic concept and selective target of cancer treatment, both as a metabolic mediator of apoptosis and in the overcoming of multiple drug resistance (MDR). Importantly, there is increasing data showing that different ion channels contribute to mediate significant aspects of cancer pH regulation and etiopathogenesis. Finally, we discuss the extension of this new pH-centric oncological paradigm into the opposite metabolic and homeostatic acid-base situation found in human neurodegenerative diseases (HNDDs), which opens novel concepts in the prevention and treatment of HNDDs through the utilization of a cohort of neural and non-neural derived hormones and human growth factors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Exopolysaccharide (EPS) are produced by a diverse of rhizobia species and has been demonstrated to be a bioemulsifier with potential applications in the degradation of hydrocarbons. In the present study, attempts were made to obtain the new exopolysaccharide production by Rhizobium tropici (SEMIA 4080 and MUTZC3) strains during growth on hydrocarbon substrate. Under the different cultivation conditions, the high molecular weight exopolysaccharides from Rhizobium tropici strains cultivated for 96 h mainly consisted of carbohydrates (79–85%) and a low percentage of protein. The EPSC3-D differed from the others, with only 60% of carbohydrate. However, all strains produced polymers with distinct rheology properties, such as viscosity of each EPS sample, suitable for different applications. In addition, RP-HPLC, FTIR and NMR studies revealed EPS produced by rhizobia strains were similar indicating minimal difference between EPS compositions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Endophytes are microorganisms that colonize living, internal tissues of plants without causing any immediate, overt negative effects. In recent years, both endophytic bacteria and fungi have been demonstrated to be excellent exopolysaccharides (EPS) producers. This review focuses on the recent advances in EPS produced by endophytes, including its production, isolation and purification, structural characterization, physiological role and biological activity. In general, EPS production is influenced by media components and cultivation conditions. The structures of purified EPS range from linear homopolysaccharides to highly branched heteropolysaccharides. These structurally novel EPS not only play important roles in plant-endophyte interactions; but also exhibit several biological functions, such as antioxidant, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic and prebiotic activities. In order to utilize endophytic EPS on an industrial scale, both yield and productivity enhancement strategies are required at several levels. Besides, the exact mechanisms on the physiological roles and biological functions of EPS should be elucidated in future. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The vitamin B6 salvage pathway, involving pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase (PNPOx) and pyridoxal kinase (PLK), recycles B6 vitamers from nutrients and protein turnover to produce pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), the catalytically active form of the vitamin. Regulation of this pathway, widespread in living organisms including humans and many bacteria, is very important to vitamin B6 homeostasis but poorly understood. Although some information is available on the enzymatic regulation of PNPOx and PLK, little is known on their regulation at the transcriptional level. In the present work, we identified a new MocR-like regulator, PtsJ from Salmonella typhimurium, which controls the expression of the pdxK gene encoding one of the two PLKs expressed in this organism (PLK1). Analysis of pdxK expression in a ptsJ knockout strain demonstrated that PtsJ acts as a transcriptional repressor. This is the first case of a MocR-like regulator acting as repressor of its target gene. Expression and purification of PtsJ allowed a detailed characterisation of its effector and DNA-binding properties. PLP is the only B6 vitamer acting as effector molecule for PtsJ. A DNA-binding region composed of four repeated nucleotide sequences is responsible for binding of PtsJ to its target promoter. Analysis of binding stoichiometry revealed that protein subunits/DNA molar ratio varies from 4 : 1 to 2 : 1, depending on the presence or absence of PLP. Structural characteristics of DNA transcriptional factor-binding sites suggest that PtsJ binds DNA according to a different model with respect to other characterised members of the MocR subgroup. © 2016 Federation of European Biochemical Societies},

abstract={Context: Clove (Eugenia caryophyllata Thunb. [Myrtaceae]) essential oil (CEO) has been shown to possess antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties. However, few studies have focused on its topical use. Objective: We investigated the biological activity of a commercially available CEO in a human skin disease model. Materials and methods: We evaluated the effect of CEO on 17 protein biomarkers that play critical roles in inflammation and tissue remodelling in a validated human dermal fibroblast system, which was designed to model chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Four concentrations of CEO (0.011, 0.0037, 0.0012, and 0.00041%, v/v) were studied. The effect of 0.011% CEO on genome-wide gene expression was also evaluated. Results and discussion: CEO at a concentration of 0.011% showed robust antiproliferative effects on human dermal fibroblasts. It significantly inhibited the increased production of several proinflammatory biomarkers such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), interferon γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10), interferon-inducible T-cell α chemoattractant (I-TAC), and monokine induced by γ interferon (MIG). CEO also significantly inhibited tissue remodelling protein molecules, namely, collagen-I, collagen-III, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP-2). Furthermore, it significantly modulated global gene expression and altered signalling pathways critical for inflammation, tissue remodelling, and cancer signalling processes. CEO significantly inhibited VCAM-1 and collagen III at both protein and gene expression levels. Conclusions: This study provides important evidence of CEO-induced anti-inflammatory and tissue remodelling activity in human dermal fibroblasts. This study also supports the anticancer properties of CEO and its major active component eugenol. © 2017 doterra international.},

abstract={This study reports the characterization and antiproliferative activity of exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by submerged cultures of the endophytes Diaporthe sp. JF766998 and Diaporthe sp. JF767007 isolated from the medicinal plant Piper hispidum Sw. Both strains secreted a crude EPS that, upon size exclusion chromatography, showed to contain a heteropolysaccharide (galactose, glucose and mannose) and a high-molecular weight glucan. Data from methylation analysis, FTIR and NMR spectroscopy (1H, COSY, TOCSY and HSQC-DEPT) indicated that the purified glucan consisted of a main chain of glucopyranosyl β-(1 → 3) linkages substituted at O-6 by glucosyl residues. According to MTT assay, some treatments of both β-glucans have antiproliferative activity against human breast carcinoma (MCF-7) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2-C3A) cells after 24 and 48 h of treatment, exhibiting a degree of inhibition ratio that reached the highest values at 400 μg/mL: 58.0% (24 h) and 74.6% (48 h) for MCF-7 cells, and 61.0% (24 h) and 83.3% (48 h) for HepG2-C3A cells.

abstract={Zinc is one of the heavy metal in plants that causes toxicity at high concentration via producing Reactive oxygen species. Nitric oxide can protect cells from oxidative stress produced by reactive oxygen Species. Effect of different concentrations of Zn (0, 100, 300 and 500 μM) and interaction with sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a donor of NO) (100 and 200 μM) were studied on growth parameter (total dry Weight) and some physiological factors (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde contents), antioxidant enzymes (catalase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase and Superoxide dismutase) in Plantago major L. Excess Zn reduced dry weight and chlorophyll content, resulting a decrease in photosynthesis. Zn stress induced the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), leading to malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation. Furthermore, it was found that the activities of antioxidant enzymes in Zn-treated plants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) were decreased but peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) were increased. The use of NO especially in low concentration reversed Zn-induced negative effects whereas high concentration of NO had no obvious alleviating effect on Zn toxicity in Plantago major L. In particular, application of 100 μM SNP could mitigate Zn stress, as a defense mechanism of the plant against Zn toxicity. © 2017, ALÖKI Kft.},

abstract={Millions of tons of corn, pineapple, sugarcane and wheat are annually produced and their industrial processing generates large amounts of wastes. Current study evaluated the use of corncob (CC), pineapple peel (PP), sugarcane bagasse (SB) and wheat bran (WB) as substrates for α-amylase production by submerged cultures of nine endophytes from Piper hispidum Sw. Initially, fungi were grown on a starch medium and the cup plate assay showed that five strains were amylase-positive: Bipolaris sp. JF767001, Marasmius cladophyllus JF767003, Phlebia sp. JF766997, Phyllosticta capitalensis JF766988 and Schizophyllum commune JF766994, with enzymatic halos ranging between 6.30 ± 0.08 and 8.87 ± 0.68 mm in diameter. Further, the use of agro-industrial wastes was evaluated by the cup plate assay, where the highest halo diameters were obtained from fungi grown on PP or SB: up to 15.00 ± 0.16 mm (Phlebia sp.) and 14.80 ± 0.18 mm (S. commune), respectively. Submerged cultures with PP or SB showed the highest levels of α-amylase activity according to the starch-iodine assay, or rather, up to 4.14 ± 0.02 U mL-1 (Bipolaris sp.) and 4.09 ± 0.02 U mL-1 (Phlebia sp.), respectively. Results give an in-depth knowledge on tropical endophytes that might be α-amylase sources, and indicate the suitability of these agro-industrial wastes as substrates for fungal enzymatic production. © 2017, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

abstract={The analysis of the n-butanol extract of Linaria tingitana (BELT) by HPLC-DAD–ESI/MS allowed the identification of four iridoids structurally confirmed by NMR and ESI–MS/MS extensive experiments data. The subjection of BELT to the anti-inflammatory activity showed that it exhibited a concentration dependent stabilisation of HRBC membrane, inhibition of protein denaturation and nitric oxide scavenging effect in the in vitro process. These results were confirmed in the in vivo experiments which showed that BELT was found to be most pronounced at 200 mg/kg after carrageenan injection which significantly reduced the swelling in both early and late phases of carrageenan-evoked oedema, as well as a significant reduce at the accumulation of infiltrating cells, inhibition of the myeloperoxidase activity and suppressed the lipid peroxidation. These results were supported by the histological analysis which revealed the reduction of oedema and cells infiltration, this might be influenced by the synergistic action of the above isolated compounds. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={In this study, we aimed to evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of Opuntia ficus-indica cactus cladode extracts in microglia BV-2 cells. Inflammation associated with microglia activation in neuronal injury can be achieved by LPS exposure. Using four different structurally and biologically well-characterized LPS serotypes, we revealed a structure-related differential effect of LPS on fatty acid β-oxidation and antioxidant enzymes in peroxisomes: Escherichia coli-LPS decreased ACOX1 activity while Salmonella Minnesota-LPS reduced only catalase activity. Different cactus cladode extracts showed an antioxidant effect through microglial catalase activity activation and an anti-inflammatory effect by reducing nitric oxide (NO) LPS-dependent production. These results suggest that cactus extracts may possess a neuroprotective activity through the induction of peroxisomal antioxidant activity and the inhibition of NO production by activated microglial cells. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Introduction: The ability of most laboratories to easily access CRISPR/Cas9 engineering tools has caused a revolution in biology. One of the areas that will continue to be impacted by genome editing is the drug discovery process. Objective: CRISPR/Cas9 will not only serve to accelerate the drug discovery pipeline, but also streamline line it by identifying high-value targets, facilitating the validation of drug: target interactions and mechanisms of action, and stimulating the development of phenotype-based high throughput screens as alternatives to target-based assays. Conclusion: We review the literature and hurdles that have been overcome to develop the current generation of tools being used to enrich the drug discovery paradigm. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) have long been used as inoculant for optimizing legume production, but their survival under hostile field conditions is conflicted. Endophytes among PGPR are the microorganisms that live inside different plant tissues for at least part of their life without harming their host. Beneficial endophytes facilitate plant growth by enhancing uptake of plant nutrients, protecting plants from phytopathogens and increasing tolerance against environmental stresses. Nevertheless, the cellular interactions between pulses and endophytes for improving legumes growth and yields are variable. The endophytic colonization and diversity, various growth promontory aspects, and recent advances in endophyte-legume interactions with consequential impact on legume production have been discussed comprehensively. Considering the importance of endophytic microorganisms, it is likely that their use in agricultural practices will play a pivotal role and offer environmentally friendly strategy for increasing legume productivity while decreasing chemical inputs. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Detailed data from statistical analyses of the structural properties of the inter-domain linker peptides of the bacterial regulators of the family MocR are herein reported. MocR regulators are a recently discovered subfamily of bacterial regulators possessing an N-terminal domain, 60 residue long on average, folded as the winged-helix-turn-helix architecture responsible for DNA recognition and binding, and a large C-terminal domain (350 residue on average) that belongs to the fold type-I pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) dependent enzymes such aspartate aminotransferase. Data show the distribution of several structural characteristics of the linkers taken from bacterial species from five different phyla, namely Actinobacteria, Alpha-, Beta-, Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes. Interpretation and discussion of reported data refer to the article “Structural properties of the linkers connecting the N- and C- terminal domains in the MocR bacterial transcriptional regulators” (T.

abstract={β-Galactosidase encoded by the Escherichia coli lacZ gene, is widely used as a reporter molecule in molecular biology in a wide variety of animals. β-Galactosidase retains its enzymatic activity in cells or tissues even after fixation and can degrade X-Gal, a frequently used colormetric substrate, producing a blue color. Therefore, it can be used for the activity staining of fixed tissues. However, the enzymatic activity of the β-galactosidase that is ectopically expressed in the non-fixed tissues of animals has not been extensively studied. Here, we report the characterization of β-galactosidase activity in Drosophila tissues with and without fixation in various experimental conditions comparing the activity of two evolutionarily orthologous β-galactosidases derived from the E. coli lacZ and Drosophila melanogaster DmelGal genes. We performed quantitative analysis of the activity staining of larval imaginal discs and an in vitro assay using larval lysates. Our data showed that both E. coli and Drosophila β-galactosidase can be used for cell-type-specific activity staining, but they have their own preferences in regard to conditions. E. coli β-galactosidase showed a preference for neutral pH but not for acidic pH compared with Drosophila β-galactosidase. Our data suggested that both E. coli and Drosophila β-galactosidase show enzymatic activity in the physiological conditions of living animals when they are ectopically expressed in a desired specific spatial and temporal pattern. This may enable their future application to studies of chemical biology using model animals. © 2016 The Author(s)},

CRISPR/Cas9 system is used for genome engineering applications across diverse eukaryotic species. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering system for drug target validation in human cells. Pladienolide B is a natural macrolide with antitumor activities mediated through the inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing. To validate the spliceosomal target of Pladienolide B, we employed the CRSIPR/Cas9 system to introduce targeted mutations in the subunits of the SF3B complex in the HEK293T cells. Our data reveal that targeted mutagenesis of the SF3b1 subunit exhibited higher levels of resistance to Pladienolide B. Therefore, our data validate the spliceosomal target of Pladienolide B and provide a proof of concept on using the CRISPR/Cas9 system for drug target identification and validation. © 2016 The Authors},

abstract={Several studies demonstrated a correlation between green tea consumption and a reduced cancer risk. Among different components, green tea polyphenols have been identified as molecules responsible for the beneficial effects showed by the green tea against oxidative stress and cell invasiveness. In this study, we investigated the effects of green tea polyphenol extracts (GTPs) in human gastric MKN-28 cell line. To this aim, we have first evaluated the effect of GTPs on oxidative stress induced cell injury. The pre-treatment with 10−4 M catechin equivalents of GTPs exerts a protective effect on xanthine–xanthine oxidase induced cell cytotoxicity, thus confirming the anti-oxidant properties of GTPs. The effect of GTPs was also extended to the invasive ability of MKN-28 cells stimulated with TNF-α or LPS, as pro-inflammatory factors. Migration and matrigel invasion assays demonstrated that GTPs exposure (10−6 M) prevents the increase in cell invasiveness induced by TNF-α or LPS. Finally, we have analyzed the effect of GTPs on the levels of Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMP)-9/2, whose expression is up-regulated by TNF-α or LPS. Our results indicated that the pre-treatment with GTPs was able to reduce MMP-9/2 expression at both protein and enzyme activity levels in the conditioned media of TNF-α or LPS stimulated MKN-28 cells. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that green tea polyphenol extract reduces the invasiveness of gastric MKN-28 cancer cells through the reduction of TNF-α or LPS induced MMP-9/2 up-regulation. Therefore, these data support the hypothesis that GTPs could exert a protective role against the metastatic process in gastric cancer. © 2016 The Author(s)},

abstract={NAD+-dependent Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (NAD+-IDH) could be one of the cell phone radiation targets. Enzyme activity alteration may lead to decline in sperm motility during radio-frequency electromagnetic waves (RF-EMW) exposure. The current case control study aimed to investigate the possible relationship between mitochondrial NAD+-IDH activity in human seminal plasma and sperm motility among asthenozoospermic cellular phone users. A total number of ninety idiopathic infertile males referred from the Department of Dermatology and Andrology, were enrolled in this study. NAD+-IDH activity was measured in human seminal plasma by spectrophotometer. Computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA) following WHO criteria has been used for semen analyses. The results showed that IDH activity was increased in patients with prolonged cell phone daily use ≥4 h/day. Its level, correlated negatively with either the motility ratio percentages (r = −0.46, p &lt; 0.001) or the progressive motility percentages (r = −0.50, p &lt; 0.001) in the study groups. The current study suggests that NAD+-IDH in human seminal plasma could be one of seminal plasma biomarkers reflecting the mitochondrial function of spermatozoa. Alteration of its level could reflect the defective motility of sperms among some cases of cellular phone users. © 2016 The Authors},

abstract={Information on dimethyl nitrosamine (DMN)-induced toxicity on endocrine functions is still scanty. This study therefore investigated the outcomes of DMN-induced toxicity on endocrine (thyroid and reproductive) functions, as well as kallikrein-3 level, and effects of ascorbate treatments in male wistar rats. Thirty animals divided into six groups of five rats each were used. Group I animals were the normal control, group II animals served as vehicle control and were administered a single intraperitoneal dose of normal saline, groups III and IV were intraperitoneally injected with a single dose of 30 mg/kg DMN for 48 h, but group IV animals were post-treated orally with 5.71 mg/kg body weight (400 mg/70 kg) ascorbate for seven days, group V animals were pre-treated with same dose of ascorbate orally for seven days before intraperitoneal injection of DMN, while group VI animals were orally administered ascorbate only for seven days. Compared with control, DMN administration resulted in significant decrease (p &lt; 0.05) in serum total cholesterol, testosterone (TST), luteinizing hormone (LH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), and kallikrein III (KLK-3) levels, as well as non-significant increase in serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level. Pre-treatment with ascorbate significantly increase LH and KLK-3 levels, while post-treatment significantly increase fT3 level. Also, pre-treatment with ascorbate significantly reduced TSH level, while there was no significant difference in TST level following ascorbate treatments. From our findings and to some extent, ascorbate demonstrates ameliorative effects against DMN-induced hormonal disruption in male wistar rats, and this may be attributed to its antioxidant property. © 2016 The Authors},

abstract={Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are potent carcinogens. Among these, dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) is well known for its capacity to induce mammary carcinomas in female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Ovariectomy suppresses the susceptibility of this model to DMBA, thus suggesting that the inducible action of the carcinogen depends on ovarian hormones. The promotion of DMBA-induced adenocarcinoma is accompanied by a series of neuroendocrine disruptions of both Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Gonadal (HPG) and Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axes and of the secretion of melatonin during the latency period of 2 months that precedes the occurrence of the first mammary tumor. The present review analyses the various neuroendocrine disruptions that occur along the HPG and the HPA axes, and the marked inhibitory effect of the carcinogen on melatonin secretion. The possible relationships between the neuroendocrine disruptions, which essentially consist in an increased pre-ovulatory secretion of 17β-estradiol and prolactin, associated with a marked reduction of melatonin secretion, and the decrease in gene expression of the receptors for aryl-hydrocarbons receptor (AhR) and 17β-estradiol (ERα; ERβ) are also discussed. © 2016 The Authors},

abstract={Peptide inter-domain linkers are peptide segments covalently linking two adjacent domains within a protein. Linkers play a variety of structural and functional roles in naturally occurring proteins. In this work we analyze the sequence properties of the predicted linker regions of the bacterial transcriptional regulators belonging to the recently discovered MocR subfamily of the GntR regulators. Analyses were carried out on the MocR sequences taken from the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria. The results suggest that MocR linkers display phylum-specific characteristics and unique features different from those already described for other classes of inter-domain linkers. They show an average length significantly higher: 31.8 ± 14.3 residues reaching a maximum of about 150 residues. Compositional propensities displayed general and phylum-specific trends. Pro is dominating in all linkers. Dyad propensity analysis indicate Pro–Pro as the most frequent amino acid pair in all linkers. Physicochemical properties of the linker regions were assessed using amino acid indices relative to different features: in general, MocR linkers are flexible, hydrophilic and display propensity for β-turn or coil conformations. Linker sequences are hypervariable: only similarities between MocR linkers from organisms related at the level of species or genus could be found with sequence searches. The results shed light on the properties of the linker regions of the new MocR subfamily of bacterial regulators and may provide knowledge-based rules for designing artificial linkers with desired properties. © 2016 The Author(s)},

abstract={In the present study we evaluated the pre-treatment (priming) of Arabidopsis thaliana plants with sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a NO-donor, as an interesting approach for improving plant tolerance to cadmium stress. We focused on the cell redox balance and on the methionine sulfoxide reductases (MSR) family as a key component of such response. MSR catalyse the reversible oxidation of MetSO residues back to Met. Five MSRA genes and nine MSRB genes have been identified in A. thaliana, coding for proteins with different subcellular locations. After treating 20 days-old A. thaliana (Col 0) plants with 100 μM CdCl2, increased protein carbonylation in leaf tissue, lower chlorophyll content and higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in chloroplasts were detected, together with increased accumulation of all MSR transcripts evaluated. Further analysis showed reduction in guaiacol peroxidase activity (GPX) and increased catalase (CAT) activity, with no effect on ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity. Pre-exposition of plants to 100 μM SNP before cadmium treatment restored redox balance; this seems to be linked to a better performance of antioxidant defenses. Our results indicate that NO priming may be acting as a modulator of plant antioxidant system by interfering in oxidative responses and by preventing up-regulation of MSR genes caused by metal exposure. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM)},

abstract={Estrogen receptor (ER) antagonists such as tamoxifen (Tam) have been used successfully to treat ER+ breast cancers for more than 30 years. Unfortunately, long term use of Tam can result in resistance. Tam resistance is associated with the activation of growth factor signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation and survival. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), is up-regulated in Tam resistant (Tam-R) cells. Previous studies have reported that the flavanone, naringenin (Nar) can inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in ER+ breast cancer cells. Furthermore, Nar has been shown to inhibit the MAPK signaling pathways in MCF-7 cells. In this report we investigated whether inhibition of MAPK alone is mediating the effects of Nar on cell proliferation and viability. These studies will determine the mechanism of action of Nar. Tam-R MCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated with Nar or U0126, a MAPK kinase inhibitor. Our studies show that while both U0126 and Nar impaired cell proliferation and viability the combination of U0126 and Nar resulted in greater inhibition of cell viability than either compound alone. It has been previously reported that Nar can bind the ER. Our lab has also shown that Nar localizes ERα to a peri-nuclear region of the cell. Confocal microscopy revealed that in U0126 treated cells ERα displayed an even distribution across the cytoplasm as seen in untreated Tam-R cells. These studies suggest that MAPK is not the only target of Nar. © 2016 The Authors},

abstract={Orphan receptor NURR1 (also termed NR4A2) belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily and functions as a regulatory factor of differentiation, migration, maturation and maintenance of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. NURR1 plays an important role in nigrostriatal dopamine neuron development and is therefore implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases linked to the dopamine system of the midbrain. Here we report the isolation and characterization of porcine NURR1 cDNA. The NURR1 cDNA was RT-PCR cloned using NURR1-specific oligonucleotide primers derived from in silico sequences. The porcine NURR1 cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 598 amino acids, displaying a very high similarity with bovine, human and mouse (99%) NURR1 protein. Expression analysis revealed a differential NURR1 mRNA expression in various organs and tissues. NURR1 transcripts could be detected as early as at 60 days of embryo development in different brain tissues. A significant increase in NURR1 transcript in the cerebellum and a decrease in NURR1 transcript in the basal ganglia was observed during embryo development. The porcine NURR1 gene was mapped to chromosome 15. Two missense mutations were found in exon 3, the first coding exon of NURR1. Methylation analysis of the porcine NURR1 gene body revealed a high methylation degree in brain tissue, whereas methylation of the promoter was very low. A decrease in DNA methylation in a discrete region of the NURR1 promoter was observed in pig frontal cortex during pig embryo development. This observation correlated with an increase in NURR1 transcripts. Therefore, methylation might be a determinant of NURR1 expression at certain time points in embryo development. © 2016 The Authors},

abstract={Dermal scaffolds promote healing of debilitating skin injuries caused by burns and chronic skin conditions. Currently available products present disadvantages and therefore, there is still a clinical need for developing new dermal substitutes. This study aimed at comparing the viscoelastic, physical and bio-degradable properties of two dermal scaffolds, the collagen-based and clinically well established Integra® and a novel fibrin-based dermal scaffold developed at our laboratory called Smart Matrix®, to further evaluate our previous published findings that suggested a higher influx of cells, reduced wound contraction and less scarring for Smart Matrix® when used in vivo. Rheological results showed that Integra® (G′ = 313.74 kPa) is mechanically stronger than Smart Matrix® (G′ = 8.26 kPa), due to the presence of the silicone backing layer in Integra®. Micro-pores were observed on both dermal scaffolds, although nano-pores as well as densely packed nano-fibres were only observed for Smart Matrix®. Average surface roughness was higher for Smart Matrix® (Sa = 114.776 nm) than for Integra® (Sa = 75.565 nm). Both scaffolds possess a highly porous structure (80-90%) and display a range of pore micro-sizes that represent the actual in vivo scenario. In vitro proteolytic bio-degradation suggested that Smart Matrix® would degrade faster upon implantation in vivo than Integra®. For both scaffolds, the enzymatic digestion occurs via bulk degradation. These observed differences could affect cell behaviour on both scaffolds. Our results suggest that fine-tuning of scaffolds' viscoelastic, physical and bio-degradable properties can maximise cell behaviour in terms of attachment, proliferation and infiltration, which are essential for tissue repair. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={A pot experiment was conducted to study the effects of sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a nitric oxide [NO] donor) on cadmium (Cd) toxicity in ryegrass plants. In the present study, ryegrass plants subjected to Cd toxicity were treated with different concentrations of SNP (50, 100, 300 and 500 µM), SNP solution was poured into Cd-contaminated soil every seven days. Cd treatment inhibited the plants growth and the absorption of micronutrients, increased accumulation of Cd in both shoots and roots. In Cd-treated plants, the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the contents of proline, soluble protein and ascorbic acid (AsA) decreased dramatically, whereas the accumulation of superoxide anion (O2.-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) increased significantly. Addition of SNP significantly decreased O2.-, H2O2 and MDA accumulation in both shoots and roots of Cd-stressed plants, decreased the transport of Cd from roots to shoots, alleviated the inhibition of Ca, Fe, Mg and Zn absorption induced by Cd and promoted the plant growth. In SNP-treated plants, the chlorophyll content, the contents of proline, soluble protein and ascorbic acid, and the activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase and catalase increased considerably. Addition of 300 µM SNP had the most significant alleviating effect against Cd toxicity while the addition of 500 µM SNP had no significant effect with Cd treatment. Based on these results, we concluded that the optimal concentrations of exogenous SNP could alleviate Cd induced stress and promote ryegrass plant growth. © 2016, Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo.

abstract={Aim: To investigate the effects of rs25487 (the DNA repair gene: x-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cells 1 [XRCC1]) and codon 249 mutation (TP53 gene) on clinical outcomes of post-hepatectomy hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC. Methods: The XRCC1 rs25487 polymorphism and TP53 mutation at codon 249 of 485 hepatitis B surface antigen positive patients subjected to hepatectomy were genotyped via direct sequencing. SPSS software version 16.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used to calculate survival of HCC patients according to primary end-points. Results: The presence of at least one A allele (AA/AG) of rs25487 was associated with unfavorable prognosis (P = 0.005). Moreover, A allele (AA/AG) carriers were significantly associated with high risk of vascular invasion (P = 0.025) and regional invasion (P = 0.005). Differences were not significant between mutant and wild-type TP53 cases with overall survival (adjusted P = 0.400). Among the 485 participants, patients (n = 73) carrying both the A allele (AA/AG) of rs25487 and 249Ser TP53 mutation displayed decreased overall survival, compared with patients (n = 184) with the GG genotype of rs25487 and wild-type codon 249 (adjusted P = 0.007). Conclusion: Polymorphisms of rs25487 may play a potential role in survival of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma patients following hepatectomy. While mutation at codon 249 of TP53 is not associated with HBV-related HCC survival in this study. © 2015 The Japan Society of Hepatology},

abstract={Growth at high temperatures is one of the desired features for industrial applications of microbes, as it results in decrease in contamination and enhanced solubility of certain substrates. In this study, it is demonstrated that heterologous expression of a wheat cyclophilin, TaCypA-1, confers thermotolerance to Escherichia coli. The TaCypA-1 possesses peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity that catalyses cis to trans isomerization of the peptidyl prolyl bonds, a rate limiting step in protein folding. Expression of deleted mutants of TaCypA-1, that lacked PPIase activity, resulted in abrogation of thermotolerance, providing the first evidence that this activity plays a key role in stress tolerance of cells and can be exploited for industrial applications. Further, we also demonstrate that TaCypA-1 interacts with calmodulin (CaM), and the CaM-binding domain is localized to amino acid residues 51-71 in the N-terminus region. © 2015 The Authors.

With the aim to reconstitute in vitro the HIV-1 tRNA3Lys packaging complex, we first searched for the putative involvement of another viral protein in the selective viral hijacking of mLysRS only. After screening all the viral proteins, we observed that Vpr and Rev have the potential to interact with mLysRS, but that this association does not take place at the level of the assembly of mLysRS into the packaging complex. We also show that tRNA3Lys can form a ternary complex with the two purified proteins mLysRS and the Pol domain of GagPol, which mimicks its packaging complex. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Recently, it has been recognized that, much like an electric current in an electric circuit, dynamic disruptions from flexible, unstructured regions distal to the active region are transferred through the contact network to the active site and influence protein stability and/or function. As transmembrane proteins frequently possess the β-barrel structure, studies of proteins with this topology are required. The unstructured lid segments of the β-barrel GFP protein are conserved and could play a role in the backbone stabilization required for chromophore function. A study of the disordered C-terminus and the function within the lid is necessary. In this study, we entirely truncated the flexible C-terminal tail and investigated the N-terminal Strep-tagged GFP by fluorescence spectroscopy, and the temperature- and GdnHCl-induced unfolding by circular dichroism. The introduction of the unstructured Strep-tag itself changed the unfolding pathway. Truncating the entire flexible tail did not decrease the fluorescence intensity to a large extent; however, the protein stability changed dramatically. The temperature for half-denaturation T1/2 changed significantly from 79 °C for the wild-type to 72.8 °C for the mutant. Unfolding kinetics at different temperatures have been induced by 4 M GdnHCl, and the apparent Arrhenius activation energy decreased by 40% as compared to the wild-type. © 2015 The Authors.

abstract={Metastasis is the leading cause of mortality in patients with breast cancer. In triple-negative breast cancer, high recurrence rates, increased invasive capacity of cells, and their aggressive ability to metastasize at secondary sites dictate patient survival. The Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) plays a critical role in controlling the metastatic potential of these cells. Its activity results in an elevation of intracellular pH and in extracellular acidification, a key step in the establishment of the tumor microenvironment. Here, we describe assays for characterization of Na+/H+ exchanger activity and its related downstream physiological effects on triple-negative breast cancer cells. Na+/H+ exchanger activity can be routinely and rapidly measured in live cells with a fluorometric assay that assesses changes in intracellular pH. Characterization of downstream cell effector function as a result of Na+/H+ exchanger activation can be evaluated by measuring directed cell migration and invasion. Cell migration is assessed with wound-healing assays, where a gap is introduced in a confluent monolayer of cells and the rate of gap closure is measured over time. Cell invasion is assessed in the short-term by transwell invasion assays that track cell movement through an extracellular matrix. Long-term invasiveness, growth and proliferation can be assessed with 3-D invasion assays using transwell inserts fitted with specialized scaffolds optimized for 3-D cell culture. Taken together these assays provide powerful tools for testing the effects of altering Na+/H+ exchanger activity with chemical inhibition on the metastatic capacity of breast cancer cells. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={An enzyme, O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase (OASTL), also known as O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase or cysteine synthase (CSase), catalyses the incorporation of sulfide into O-acetylserine and produces cysteine. We previously identified a cDNA encoding an OASTL-like protein from Spinacia oleracea, (SoCSaseLP), but a recombinant SoCSaseLP produced in Escherichia coli did not show OASTL activity. The exon-intron structure of the SoCSaseLP gene shared conserved structures with other spinach OASTL genes. The SoCSaseLP and a Beta vulgaris homologue protein, KMT13462, comprise a unique clade in the phylogenetic tree of the OASTL family. Interestingly, when the SoCSaseLP gene was expressed in tobacco plants, total OASTL activity in tobacco leaves was reduced. This reduction in total OASTL activity was most likely caused by interference by SoCSaseLP with cytosolic OASTL. To investigate the possible interaction of SoCSaseLP with a spinach cytosolic OASTL isoform SoCSaseA, a pull-down assay was carried out. The recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-SoCSaseLP fusion protein was expressed in E. coli together with the histidine-tagged SoCSaseA protein, and the protein extract was subjected to glutathione affinity chromatography. The histidine-tagged SoCSaseA was co-purified with the GST-SoCSaseLP fusion protein, indicating the binding of SoCSaseLP to SoCSaseA. Consistent with this interaction, the OASTL activity of the co-purified SoCSaseA was reduced compared with the activity of SoCSaseA that was purified on its own. These results strongly suggest that SoCSaseLP negatively regulates the activity of other cytosolic OASTL family members by direct interaction. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Toxic heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) are global problems that are a growing threat to the environment. Despite some heavy metals are required for plant growth and development, others are considered toxic elements and do not play any known physiological role in plant cells. Elevated doses of Cd or Cu cause toxicity in plants and generate damages due to the stress condition and eventually cause a significant reduction in quantity and quality of crop plants. The nitric oxide (NO) donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) is reported to alleviate the toxicity of some heavy metals like Cd and Cu. In the current study, the role of NO in alleviating stresses of Cd and Cu was investigated in in vitro-grown tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) Based on plant growth, total chlorophyll contents, contents and activities of rubisco and rubisco activase. According to the results of this study, the growth and total chlorophyll contents of Cd/Cu stressed plants were hugely decreased in the absence of SNP, while the supplementation of SNP resulted in a significant increase of both fresh weight and total chlorophyll contents. Remarkable reductions of Rubisco and rubisco activase contents and activities were observed in Cd and Cu-induced plants. SNP supplementation showed the highest contents and activities of rubisco and rubisco activase compared to the control and Cu/Cd-stressed plants. Taken together, our findings suggest that SNP could play a protective role in regulation of plant responses to abiotic stresses such as Cd and Cu by enhancing Rubisco and Rubisco activase. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={The FKBP22 and the related peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases dimerize using their N-terminal domains. Conversely, their C-terminal domains possess both the substrate and inhibitor binding sites. To delineate the roles of a conserved Tyr residue at their N-terminal domains, we have studied a FKBP22 mutant that carries an Ala in place of the conserved Tyr at position 15. We have demonstrated that the Tyr 15 of FKBP22 is indispensable for preserving its dimerization ability, catalytic activity, and structure. The residue, however, little contributed to its inhibitor binding ability and stability. The mode of action of Tyr 15 has been discussed at length. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Endophytic fungi have been described as producers of important bioactive compounds; however, they remain under-exploited as exopolysaccharides (EPS) sources. Therefore, this work reports on EPS production by submerged cultures of eight endophytes isolated from Piper hispidum Sw.; belonging to genera Diaporthe, Marasmius, Phlebia, Phoma, Phyllosticta and Schizophyllum. After fermentation for 96 h, four endophytes secreted EPS: Diaporthe sp. JF767000, Diaporthe sp. JF766998, Diaporthe sp. JF767007 and Phoma herbarum JF766995. The EPS from Diaporthe sp. JF766998 differed statistically from the others, with a higher percentage of carbohydrate (91%) and lower amount of protein (8%). Subsequently, this fungus was grown under submerged culture for 72, 96 and 168 h (these EPS were designated EPSD1-72, EPSD1-96 and EPSD1-168) and the differences in production, monosaccharide composition and apparent molecular were compared. The EPS yields in mg/100 mL of culture medium were: 3.0 ± 0.4 (EPSD1-72), 15.4 ± 2.2 (EPSD1-96) and 14.8 ± 1.8 (EPSD1-168). The EPSD1-72 had high protein content (28.5%) and only 71% of carbohydrate; while EPSD1-96 and EPSD1-168 were composed mainly of carbohydrate (∼95 and 100%, respectively), with low protein content (∼5%) detected at 96 h. Galactose was the main monosaccharide component (30%) of EPSD1-168. Differently, EPSD1-96 was rich in glucose (51%), with molecular weight of 46.6 kDa. It is an important feature for future investigations, because glucan-rich EPS are reported as effective antitumor agents. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={TGF-β1 is involved in many aspects of tissue development and homeostasis including hematopoiesis. The TAL1 transcription factor is also an important player of this latter process and is expressed very early in the myeloid and erythroid lineages. We previously established a link between TGF-β1 signaling and TAL1 by showing that the cytokine was able to induce its proteolytic degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. In this manuscript we show that TAL1 interacts with SMAD3 that acts in the pathway downstream of TGF-β1 association with its receptor. TAL1 expression strengthens the positive or negative effect of SMAD3 on various genes. Both transcription factors activate the inhibitory SMAD7 factor through the E box motif present in its transcriptional promoter. DNA precipitation assays showed that TAL1 present in Jurkat or K562 cells binds to this SMAD binding element in a SMAD3 dependent manner. SMAD3 and TAL1 also inhibit several genes including ID1, hTERT and TGF-β1 itself. In this latter case TAL1 and SMAD3 can impair the positive effect exerted by E47. Our results indicate that TAL1 expression can modulate TGF-β1 signaling by interacting with SMAD3 and by increasing its transcriptional properties. They also suggest the existence of a negative feedback loop between TAL1 expression and TGF-β1 signaling. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={A galactose-specific lectin from Bauhinia monandra leaves (BmoLL) has been purified through ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by guar gel affinity chromatography column. This study aimed to evaluate the potential anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activity of pure BmoLL in mice. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by 1% carrageenan-induced inflammation in mice treated with BmoLL. Acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing and hot plate methods evaluated antinociceptive activity. BmoLL significantly inhibited the carrageenan-induced paw edema by 47% (30 mg/kg) and 60.5% (60 mg/kg); acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, 100 mg/kg) showed inhibition of 70.5%, in comparison to controls. Leukocyte migration, an immune response to the inflammation process, was significantly reduced in presence of BmoLL; in mice treated with ASA the decrease in leukocyte migration was similar to 15 mg/kg of the lectin. BmoLL at doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg significantly reduced the number of animal contortions by 43.1, 50.1 and 71.3%, respectively. BmoLL leukocyte migration was significantly reduced; in mice treated with ASA the decrease in leukocyte migration was similar to 15 mg/kg of the lectin. BmoLL at doses of 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg significantly reduced the number of animal contortions by 43.1, 50.1 and 71.3%, respectively. The lectin (30 and 60 mg/kg) showed a significant effect in the hot plate assay. BmoLL anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects were dose-dependent. The search for new and natural compounds, with minimal side effects, to control pain and inflammation, is constantly increasing. BmoLL has great potential as a natural anti-inflammatory product that can be explored for pharmacological purposes. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={In eukaryotes, genes are frequently interrupted with noncoding sequences named introns. Alternative splicing is a nuclear mechanism by which these introns are removed and flanking coding regions named exons are joined together to generate a message that will be translated in the cytoplasm. This mechanism is catalyzed by a complex machinery known as the spliceosome, which is conformed by more than 300 proteins and ribonucleoproteins that activate and regulate the precision of gene expression when assembled. It has been proposed that several genetic diseases are related to defects in the splicing process, including cancer. For this reason, natural products that show the ability to regulate splicing have attracted enormous attention due to its potential use for cancer treatment. Some microbial metabolites have shown the ability to inhibit gene splicing and the molecular mechanism responsible for this inhibition is being studied for future applications.

abstract={Giardia lamblia is an intestinal protozoan parasite that causes giardiasis, a disease of high prevalence in Latin America, Asia and Africa. Giardiasis leads to poor absorption of nutrients, severe electrolyte loss and growth retardation. In addition to its clinical importance, this parasite is of special biological interest due to its basal evolutionary position and simplified metabolism, which has not been studied thoroughly. One of the most important and conserved metabolic pathways is the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). This molecule is widely known as a coenzyme in multiple redox reactions and as a substrate in cellular processes such as synthesis of Ca2+ mobilizing agents, DNA repair and gene expression regulation. There are two pathways for NAD biosynthesis, which converge at the step catalyzed by nicotinamide/nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT, EC 2.7.7.1/18). Using bioinformatics tools, we found two NMNAT sequences in Giardia lamblia (glnmnat-a and glnmnat-b). We first verified the identity of the sequences in silico. Subsequently, glnmnat-a was cloned into an expression vector. The recombinant protein (His-GlNMNAT) was purified by nickel-affinity binding and was used in direct in vitro enzyme assays assessed by C18-HPLC, verifying adenylyltransferase activity with both nicotinamide (NMN) and nicotinic acid (NAMN) mononucleotides. Optimal reaction pH and temperature were 7.3 and 26 °C. Michaelis–Menten kinetics were observed for NMN and ATP, but saturation was not accomplished with NAMN, implying low affinity yet detectable activity with this substrate. Double-reciprocal plots showed no cooperativity for this enzyme. This represents an advance in the study of NAD metabolism in Giardia spp. © 2015},

abstract={Composite biomaterials made from synthetic and protein-based polymers are extensively researched in tissue engineering. To successfully fabricate a protein-polymer composite, it is critical to understand how strongly the protein binds to the synthetic polymer, which occurs through protein adsorption. Currently, there is no cost-effective and simple method for characterizing this interfacial binding. To characterize this interfacial binding, we introduce a simple three-step method that involves: 1) synthetic polymer surface characterisation, 2) a quick, inexpensive and robust novel immuno-based assay that uses protein extraction compounds to characterize protein binding strength followed by 3) an in vitro 2D model of cell culture to confirm the results of the immuno-based assay. Fibrinogen, precursor of fibrin, was adsorbed (test protein) on three different polymeric surfaces: silicone, poly(acrylic acid)-coated silicone and poly(allylamine)-coated silicone. Polystyrene surface was used as a reference. Characterisation of the different surfaces revealed different chemistry and roughness. The novel immuno-based assay showed significantly stronger binding of fibrinogen to both poly(acrylic acid) and poly(allylamine) coated silicone. Finally, cell studies showed that the strength of the interaction between the protein and the polymer had an effect on cell growth. This novel immuno-based assay is a valuable tool in developing composite biomaterials of synthetic and protein-based polymers with the potential to be applied in other fields of research where protein adsorption onto surfaces plays an important role. © 2015 The Authors},

abstract={In patients with sepsis, liver metabolism and its capacity to provide other organs with energetic substrates are impaired. This and many other pathophysiological changes seen in human patients are reproduced in mice injected with purified endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS). In the present study, down-regulation of genes involved in hepatic fatty acid oxidation (FAOx) and gluconeogenesis in mice exposed to LPS was challenged by nutritional intervention with Argan oil. Mice given a standard chow supplemented or not with either 6% (w/w) Argan oil (AO) or 6% (w/w) olive oil (OO) prior to exposure to LPS were explored for liver gene expressions assessed by mRNA transcript levels and/or enzyme activities. AO (or OO) food supplementation reveals that, in LPS-treated mice, hepatic expression of genes involved in FAOx and gluconeogenesis was preserved. This preventive protection might be related to the recovery of the gene expressions of nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and estrogen related receptor α (ERRα) and their coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α, (PGC-1α). These preventive mechanisms conveyed by AO against LPS-induced metabolic dysregulation might add new therapeutic potentialities in the management of human sepsis. © 2015 The Authors},

abstract={Commercially available two component human fibrin sealants are commonly used to manufacture human fibrin-based biomaterials. However, this method is costly and allows little room for further tuning of the biomaterial. Human fibrinogen solutions offer a more cost-effective and versatile alternative to manufacture human fibrin-based biomaterials. Yet, human fibrinogen is highly unstable and contains certain impurities like human albumin. Within the context of biomaterials and tissue engineering we offer a simple yet novel solution based on classical biochemical techniques to significantly reduce albumin in human fibrinogen solutions. This method can be used for various tissue engineering and biomedical applications as an initial step in the manufacturing of human fibrin-based biomaterials to optimise their regenerative application. © 2015 The Authors.

abstract={Ceramides (Cers) have recently been identified as key signaling molecules that mediate biological functions such as cell growth, differentiation, senescence, apoptosis, and autophagy. However, the functions of Cer accumulation in necrotic cell death remain unknown. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between Cer accumulation with inhibition of the conversion pathway of Cer and concomitant necrotic cell death. In order to minimize the effect of apoptosis against necrotic cell death, A549 cells having the inhibiting effect of caspase 9 by survivin were used in this study. Consequently, Cer accumulation in A549 cells would likely be associated with a pathway other than the mitochondrial caspase-dependent pathway of apoptosis. Here, we showed that the dual addition of a glucosyl-Cer synthase inhibitor and a ceramidase inhibitor to A549 cell culture induced palmitoyl-Cer accumulation with Cer synthase 5 expression and necrotic cell death with lysosomal rupture together with leakage of cathepsin B/alkalization after 2-3 h, although it is unknown in this study whether the necrotic cell death was caused by the lysosomal rupture. This Cer accumulation was followed by a steep increase in sphinganine base levels via the activation of serine palmitoyltransferase activity brought about by the increase in palmitoyl-coenzyme A concentration as a substrate after 5-6 h. The increase in palmitoyl-coenzyme A concentration was achieved by activation of the fatty acid synthetic pathway from acetyl coenzyme A. © 2015 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={We recently demonstrated that citrulline (CIT) reduced the expression of inflammatory genes in cultured explants from retroperitoneal (RET) white adipose tissue (WAT) from young (2-4 months) but not old (25 months) rats. Here we show that in RET WAT from old rats and high-fat-diet-fed (HFD) young rats, the basal expression of the leptin gene was increased (275-345%) whereas that of the adiponectin gene was decreased (48-60%), when compared to those from control-diet-fed (CD) young rats. We show also that in RET WAT from old rats, a diet supplemented with CIT for 3 months reduced macrophage (F4/80, CD68) and inflammation (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α) marker genes 23-97%. CIT supplementation lowered leptin mRNA 62% and increased adiponectin mRNA 232%. In cultured explants of RET WAT from 4 month-old CD, 4 month-old HFD and 25-month-old CD rats, the exposure to 2.5 mmol/L CIT for 24 h up-regulated adiponectin gene expression 151%, 362% and 216% respectively. In contrast, leptin gene expression was down-regulated 66% selectively in CIT-treated explants from 25-month-old CD rats. These results further support the proposed beneficial effect of CIT to counteract the deleterious effects of aging and overweight on the metabolic, inflammatory and endocrine functions of WAT. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={FKBP22, an Escherichia coli-specific peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, shows substantial homology with the Mip-like virulence factors. Mip-like proteins are homodimeric and possess a V-shaped conformation. Their N-terminal domains form dimers, whereas their C-terminal domains bind protein/peptide substrates and distinct inhibitors such as rapamycin and FK506. Interestingly, the two domains of the Mip-like proteins are separated by a lengthy, protease-susceptible α-helix. To delineate the structural requirement of this domain-connecting region in Mip-like proteins, we have investigated a recombinant FKBP22 (rFKBP22) and its three point mutants I65P, V72P and A82P using different probes. Each mutant harbors a Pro substitution mutation at a distinct location in the hinge region. We report that the three mutants are not only different from each other but also different from rFKBP22 in structure and activity. Unlike rFKBP22, the three mutants were unfolded by a non-two state mechanism in the presence of urea. In addition, the stabilities of the mutants, particularly I65P and V72P, differed considerably from that of rFKBP22. Conversely, the rapamycin binding affinity of no mutant was different from that of rFKBP22. Of the mutants, I65P showed the highest levels of structural/functional loss and dissociated partly in solution. Our computational study indicated a severe collapse of the V-shape in I65P due to the anomalous movement of its C-terminal domains. The α-helical nature of the domain-connecting region is, therefore, critical for the Mip-like proteins. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={n prokaryoies, genes beiorsging to the same operon are transcribed in a single srsR-4A molecule. Transcription starts as the RNA poSymerase binds to the promoter and continues ursti it reaches a transcdptionai termirsator. Some terminators reay ors the presence of the Rho protein, whereas others function Sndependentiy of Rho. Such Rhoirsdepersdeint terminators consist of art inverted repeat foEiowed by a stretch of thymine residues, avowing us to predict their presence directiy from the D?JA sequence. Unaike in Escherkhitz col, the Rho proteirs is dispertsabie in Bacillus subtilis, suggesting a ilmited roie for Rho-dependent termisiatiors 'm this organism arse possibiy irs other Firmkutes.

abstract={The water relations of the legume Acacia harpophylla (brigalow) and of the chenopod Atriplex nummularia (old man saltbush) in response to salinity are described, and also the response of At. Nummularia to associated water stress. Both species tolerated salinities up to and beyond sea water concentration under high insolation stress: viz. 10-400 m-equiv. sodium chloride per litre for At. nummularia and 8-588 m-equiv.11, of the chlorides of sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium in factorial combination, for Ac. harpophylla. Development was not checked up to 400 m-equiv. chloride per litre in At. nummularia but was in Ac. Harpophylla, as shown by differences in leaf area and leaf number. Both species benefited by the conservation of their water supply under high salinity, the water content of their tissues being higher, especially that of the laminae, and transpiration per unit of leaf area being reduced in both species. Reduced symptoms of wilting and more rapid recovery from wilting than in controls accompanied high salinity in At. Nummularia. The water content of wilted plants, and the proportion of whole plant water in their laminae, increased with salinity. Potassium increased tissue hydration more than sodium did in Ac. harpophylla. Salinity benefits water relations in these species, especially under drought stress; this adaptation is a distinct ecological advantage. © 1972 CSIRO. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Studies have been made on the growth of peas in Richter's nutrient solution at concentrations of 1.0 (original solution), 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001; instead of employing flowing cultures, the solutions were vigorously stirred and continually replaced by fresh solution to maintain the concentration within close limits (±5%). Maximum growth occurred at the 1 and 0.1 concentrations; at lower concentrations growth was significantly depressed, but no deficiency symptoms were observed. The relative growth rate decreased regularly with decreasing concentration. No correspondence was observed between the reduction in solution concentration and that in the yield; for a concentration decrease of 1000 times, dry matter production was depressed only 4.85 times. With decreasing solution concentration the chlorophyll content however was depressed more than growth and at the lowest concentration was less than 1/80th of that in the original solution. As a result the net assimilation rate, calculated on the basis of dry matter production per unit chlorophyll content, increased sharply with decreasing nutrient solution concentration. Even at the lowest concentration the plants continued to grow throughout the course of the experiment. © 1970 Martinus Nijhoff.},

abstract={Adaptability to salinity stress was related to the productivity of Glycine wightii (G. javanica) cultivars by the technique of comparing the multivariate characteristics of response for 22 accessions that are representative of the world centres of origin. Roots and tops responses were compared to clarify the metabolic relations between glycines, as salinity was increased from that required for normal growth and metabolism to levels almost causing death due to excess sodium chloride in the substrate. There was a range and pattern of response that suggested grouping among the glycines. One group in particular was more resistant to salinity stress than others. These glycines exemplified to a greater degree than others the tendency of all to exclude sodium and to a lesser extent chloride from the plant tops. These were also the more vigorously growing glycines with a higher potassium, phosphorus, and nitrogen content in both control and saline treatments. In them, vigour of growth and control of ion content were associated, and both these factors were important determinants of tolerance to salinity stress. Sodium appeared to be more toxic than chloride to plant growth. These aspects of growth and metabolism are discussed in relation to differences in ploidy between the groups of glycines. The technique used shed further light on the important agricultural problem of combining adaptability and high productivity. © 1970 CSIRO. All Rights Are Reserved.},
