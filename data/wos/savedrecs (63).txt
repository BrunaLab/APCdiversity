AB Human serum albumin (HSA) nanoparticles are considered to be versatile carrier of anticancer agents in efficiently delivering the drug to the tumor site without causing any toxicity. The aim of the study was to develop stable HSA nanoparticles (NPs) of drug irinotecan (Iro) having slightly water solubility and moderate HSA binding. A novel strategy of employing a hydrophilic non-ionic surfactant polysorbate 80 which forms protein-polysorbate 80 complex with increased affinity and improvement in Iro-HSA binding has been used to maximize the loading and entrapment efficiency of Iro in HSA-NPs. Bespoke nanoparticles with entrapment efficiency (79.09%) and drug loading of 9.62% could be achieved with spherical shape and particle size of 77.38 nm, 0.290 polydispersity index and -23.7 mv Zeta potential. The drug entrapment in nanoparticles was confirmed by Differential Scanning Calorimeter, Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy and Fluorescence Spectroscopy. In vitro release of Iro from NPs showed biphasic-release with initial burst followed by prolonged release upto 24 h. The short-term stability investigation of nanodispersion showed no significant changes in physicochemical properties of NPs. Long-term studies on freeze dried Iro-HSA-NPs indicated good stability of NPs up to 12 months. This is the first report for efficient fabrication of Iro delivery system based on HSA nanoparticles.

AB Combination strategy involving cyclodextrin (CD) complexation and liposomal system was investigated for Paclitaxel (PTX) to improve loading. Complexation was done using 2,6-di-O-methylbetacyclodextrin (DM beta CD). Sterically stabilized double loaded PEGylated liposomes (DLPLs) containing PTX and PTX-DM beta CD complex were prepared by thin film hydration. Physicochemical characterization of complex and prepared DLPLs was carried out. Cytotoxic potential, hemolytic potential and pharmacokinetics of DLPLs were tested in comparison to Taxol (R). Aqueous solubility of PTX increased by almost 3x10(4) folds due to complexation with DM beta CD as compared to pure drug solubility. Liposomal system was found to have 162.8 +/- 4.1 nm size, zeta potential of -5.6 +/- 0.14 mV and 2-fold increase in drug loading to 5.8 mol % for PTX due to double loading. DLPLs had low hemolytic potential and higher cytotoxicity on SKOV3 cells with improvement in IC50 value by 4.2 folds as compared to Taxol (R) at 48 h. The anti-angiogenic potential of DLPLs was confirmed by 1.33 folds lesser wound recovery in SKOV3 cells compared to Taxol (R). In-vivo pharmacokinetic evaluation of DLPLs in rats substantiates improvement in circulation time, higher plasma concentration and decreased clearance rate compared to Taxol (R). An efficacious system with improved loading and pharmacokinetics was formulated as potential alternative for currently marketed PTX formulation.

AB Acute and chronic respiratory diseases account for major causes of illness and deaths worldwide. Recent developments of biotherapeutics opened a new era in the treatment and management of patients with respiratory diseases. When considering the delivery of therapeutics, the inhaled route offers great promises with a direct, non-invasive access to the diseased organ and has already proven efficient for several molecules. To assist in the future development of inhaled biotherapeutics, experimental models are crucial to assess lung deposition, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety. This review describes the animal models used in pulmonary research for aerosol drug delivery, highlighting their advantages and limitations for inhaled biologics. Overall, non-clinical species must be selected with relevant scientific arguments while taking into account their complexities and interspecies differences, to help in the development of inhaled medicines and ensure their successful transposition in the clinics.

AB Excipients with good flowability, bulk density as well as compaction properties are desired for use in tableting since they play important roles in formulation development and processing, including, handling, mixing, feeding and compaction. The objective of this paper is to examine the feasibility of using dry coating based surface modification of microcrystalline cellulose, Avicel PH-105, to produce an engineered fine grade (<30 mu m) excipient that has all three desired properties. Using a material sparing high-intensity vibrational mixer, Avciel PH-105 is dry coated with 1 wt% Aerosil 200, selected due to its relatively higher dispersive surface energy and lower particle size amongst other silica choices. The results indicated that as expected, the bulk density and flowability are significantly improved, while there was an appreciable loss of compaction. To minimize the loss of compaction, attributed to decreased surface energy after coating, while maintaining improved bulk density and flowability, the effect of reduced silica amount was examined. Remarkably, at reduced levels (0.5 wt% to 0.7 wt%) of Aerosil 200, significant improvements in bulk density and flowability were attained with only 9%-12% compaction reduction. The properties of the surface-engineered excipients were compared with several other commercially available pharmaceutical excipients using two different processibility or regime maps; tablet tensile strength versus bulk density or flow function coefficient (FFC). The surface engineered excipients exhibited the best overall performance establishing a promising pathway to engineer excipients using dry processing instead of complex processes such as spray drying.

AB Vitamin E TPGS is a tocopherol (alpha-T) based nonionic surfactant that was used in the formulation of the Tocosol (TM) paclitaxel nanoemulsion, which was withdrawn from phase III clinical trials. Unlike tocopherols, however, the tocotrienol (T-3) isomers of vitamin E were found to have innate anticancer activity and were shown to potentiate the antitumor activity of paclitaxel. The primary objective of the present study was therefore to develop a paclitaxel nanoemulsions by substituting alpha-T oil core of Tocosol (TM) with gamma-T-3 in, and vitamin E TPGS with PEGylated gamma-T-3 as the shell, and test the nanoemulsions against Bx-PC-3 and PANC-1 pancreatic tumor cells. A secondary objective was to test the activity of paclitaxel when directly conjugated with the gamma-T-3 isomer of vitamin E. The synthesis of the conjugates was confirmed by NMR and mass spectroscopy. Developed nanoemulsions were loaded with free or lipid conjugated paclitaxel. Nanoemulsions droplets were < 300 nm with fastest release observed with formulations loaded with free paclitaxel when gamma-T-3 was used as the core. Substituting alpha-T with gamma-T-3 was also found to potentiate the anticancer activity of the nanoemulsions. Although marginal increase in activity was observed when nanoemulsions were loaded with free paclitaxel, a significant increase in activity was observed when lipid conjugates were used. The results from this study suggest that the developed paclitaxel nanoemulsions with either alpha-T-3, PEGylated gamma-T-3, or paclitaxel lipid conjugates may represent a more promising option for paclitaxel delivery in cancer chemotherapy.

AB When poor aqueous solubility of active pharmaceutical ingredients is encountered during a drug formulation process, the toolbox typically utilized contains pharmaceutical salts, co-crystals, solid dispersions, cyclodextrins, lipids, liposomes and nanocrystals etc. Especially in the pharmaceutical industry, the option which confers the greatest benefit with the lowest risk is usually chosen. Several factors affect the final decision, but new technologies should also be considered especially if they can address several issues at the same time. Mesoporous inorganic systems are emerging technologies which can be utilized for improving the dissolution of poorly soluble drugs. The number of the scientific papers in this field is steadily increasing and the focus of the studies is moving away from in vitro to in vivo experiments with the first human trial already completed. Meanwhile, several start-up companies focusing on mesoporous carriers have been established. Therefore, it is conceivable that the first commercial products will find their way to pharmacies during the next 5-10 years.
   The present review surveys recent progress in research on mesoporous materials as carriers of poorly soluble drugs. We will concentrate on the research published since our previous review published in 2012 [10.1016/j.ijpharm.2012.09.008] up to the present day.

AB Insights in oral demographics have revealed that a significant percentage of population faces chronic incidences of oral diseases. The innervation of these oral manifestations is required because untreated conditions may lead to bone loss in the oral cavity and systemic complications. Conventional treatments include surgery of the affected area followed by its management and/or treatment with antibiotics. However, widely used antibiotics like Triclosan have serious side effects including down-regulation of oral keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Thus, novel treatments with more targeted approaches have been under investigation. Treatment modalities like Viral mediated gene delivery, liposomes, nanoparticles, and nanobubbles not only help in management of oral diseases but also aid in reducing the biofilm formed due to bacterial bioburden in the areas less accessible through oral and conventional means. This review focuses on the limitation of conventional treatments and highlights the recent investigations in the use of the novel treatment approaches in order to increase the patient compliance and alleviation of side effects. The authors have also tried to emphasize on the future perspectives of glucansucrase inhibitors, photodynamic therapy and probiotics as targeted drug delivery systems. However, further investigations are necessary for implementation of these novel approaches in the clinical setup.

AB Nanoparticles are promising drug delivery systems to overcome physiological barriers such as the blood-brain barrier. In this respect nanoparticle uptake into endothelial or epithelial cells is the first necessary step to overcome these obstacles. Therefore, a new strategy for the covalent attachment of drug targeting ligands on poly(lactic acid) (PLA) nanoparticles was developed and the influence of the resulting surface properties on the uptake behaviour in cerebral endothelial cells was investigated. PLA nanoparticles were modified on their surface by apolipoprotein E, penetratin, or ovalbumin using a newly developed vinyl sulfone-modified poly(vinyl alcohol)-derivative (VS-PVA) as steric stabilizer. With this approach an easy option for ligand coupling reactions to PVA-stabilized nanoparticles was achieved. All obtained formulations showed a favourable behaviour concerning cytotoxic effects on endothelial cells, not compromising their viability. Furthermore, a clear relation between cellular uptake and surface coupled functional ligand could be determined: Penetratin- and apolipoprotein E-modified nanoparticles showed a distinct higher cellular uptake than ovalbumin-modified or unmodified nanoparticles, which both can be explained by mechanistic reasons. Overall the use of the reactive VS-PVA as stabilizer for nanoparticle preparation is an universal and effective approach to couple several functional ligands to the particles' surface for targeting applications.

AB Active Freeze Drying allows for producing lyophilised powders by progressive agitation of frozen blocks undergoing sublimation. One potential application of this process is the formulation design of unstable nanosuspensions for oral drug delivery, as here shown for nanocrystal-based ketoconazole powder. With this technique, a critical vapour flow needs to be achieved in order to obtain reasonable process yields (> 78%). The size distribution of powder particles (median size between 21 and 44 mu m) was affected by the nanocrystal concentration and the drug-to-stabilizer ratio. This was assumed to be related to the mechanical strength of the solid network from which the powder particles break off. The adjustments of the drug-to-stabilizer ratio and the freezing procedure proved to play a major role in improving powder redispersibility. However, differences in powder redispersibility did not translate into significant changes in in-vitro dissolution rates. Active Freeze Drying has confirmed to be a promising tool to efficiently produce redispersible nanocrystal powders.

AB Bone tissue engineering is considered an alternative approach for conventional strategies available to treat bone defects. In this study, we have developed bone scaffolds composed of hydroxyapaptite (HAp), gelatin and mesoporous silica, all recognized as promising materials in bone tissue engineering due to favorable biocompatibility, osteoconductivity and drug delivery potential, respectively. These materials were coupled with conductive polypyrrole (PPy) polymer to create a novel bone scaffold for regenerative medicine. Conductive and non-conductive scaffolds were made by slurry casting method and loaded with a model antibiotic, vancomycin (VCM). Their properties were compared in different experiments in which scaffolds containing PPy showed good mechanical properties, higher protein adsorption and higher percentage of VCM release over a long duration of time compared to non-conductive scaffolds. Osteoblast cells were perfectly immersed into the gelatin matrix and remained viable for 14 days. Overall, new conductive composite bone scaffolds were created and the obtained results strongly verified the applicability of this conductive scaffold in drug delivery, encouraging its further development in tissue engineering applications.

AB Diffuse Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (DRIFTS)-based multivariate models were developed to quantify the content of two polymorphic impurities in mixtures with the desired active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) form, with the impurities not exceeding 2% wt/wt. In addition, close attention was paid to the outlier detection criteria: Q residuals; Hotelling T-2; and score bi-plot. While reasonably accurate results were obtained for the relatively simple calibration models for both forms of the impurity, the predictions for "blank" samples (separately verified to be impurity-free) were apparently biased. Thus, the model training sets were augmented with spectra from calibration mixtures incorporating some of the API from batches used in the prediction. The performance of the updated models as assessed by cross-validation was somewhat degraded as a result, while predictions against independent batches of API showed a decrease in bias indicating robustness had improved. Nevertheless, the Q residuals criterion disqualified a large number of prediction samples as outliers in contrast to the other two criteria that reported no issues at all. The results here demonstrated the effectiveness of DRIFTS for quantifying low concentration polymorphic impurities, while simultaneously highlighting the variability issues that can be encountered in practice and which need to be understood and managed appropriately to ensure the success of any automated or Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliant application of multivariate modeling.

AB The aim of this work was to investigate how manufacturing conditions influence phase-separated films of ethyl cellulose (EC) and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) with different molecular weights of HPC. Two HPC grades, SSL and M, with weight average molecular weights (M-w) of 30x10(3) g/mol and 365 x10(3) g/mol, respectively, were combined with EC 10 cps (70:30 w/w EC/HPC) and spray-coated from ethanol solutions onto a rotating drum under well-controlled process conditions. Generally, a low spray rate resulted in a more rapid film drying process and, consequently, in smaller HPC-rich domains in the phase-separated film structure. For EC/HPC films with the low M-w HPC (SSL) the most rapid drying process resulted in a shift from a HPC-discontinuous to a partly bicontinuous structure and an increase in the permeability for water. In contrast, films containing the high M-w HPC (M) all showed bicontinuous structures, which resulted in overall higher water permeabilities and polymer release compared to the low M-w films. Interestingly, a maximum in permeability was observed for the high M-w films at intermediate spray rates. Below this spray rate the permeability decreased due to a lower amount of polymer released and at higher spray rates, the permeability decreased due to a loss of pore connectivity (or increased tortuosity). To conclude, this study shows that different M-w systems of EC/HPC can respond differently to variations in manufacturing conditions.

AB Highly ordered mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) with pore diameter of 2.754 nm and particle size of 115 +/- 15 nm were prepared with etching method. Homogeneous PEGylated lipid bilayer with 10-15 nm thickness was coated around the surface of MSNs using film hydration method. Systematic optimization and characterization of co-encapsulation process of paclitaxel (Tax) and curcumin (Cur) into PEGylated lipid bilayer coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (PLMSNs) were performed carrying out single factor test, associated with Box-Behnken Design. The concentration of encapsulated drugs was measured by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method. Optimal factor settings were as follows: 50 mg MSNs, ratio of MSNs to lipid (w/w) = 1: 1.11, and ratio of lipid to CHO (w/w) = 3.93: 1. The average experimental EETax, EECur and stability score value were (77.48 +/- 2.73) %, (30.70 +/- 3.56) % and 4 point respectively based on the conditions mentioned above. Morphology determination of Tax-Cur-PLMSNs revealed that the composite nanoparticles were spherical particals with uniform dispersion. In vitro release experiment indicated that PLMSNs improved dissolution of Tax compared to Tax powder suspension and exhibited sustained release property. TaxCur- PLMSNs manifested definite and persistently promoted cytotoxic effect against canine breast cancer cells. This prolonged and enhanced activity of Tax-Cur-PLMSNs might contribute to its sustained release effect.

AB Self-emulsifying drug delivery systems, commonly used for oral delivery of poorly soluble compounds, were used to formulate water soluble but moisture labile compounds for rectal application. The objective was to use the oily phase of the system to formulate a liquid, non-aqueous product while obtaining the advantages of self-emulsification, rapid contact with the rectal mucosa and rapid absorption post-administration. Ceftriaxone was used as a model drug and the human bile salt sodium chenodeoxycholate was used as an absorption enhancer. After preliminary screening of 23 excipients, based on their emulsification ability and emulsion fineness in binary and ternary mixtures, a full factorial design was used to screen different formulations of three preselected excipients. The optimal formulation contained 60% of excipients, namely Capryol 90, Kolliphor EL and Kolliphor PS20 in 4 : 6 : 6 ratio and 40% of a powder blend that included 500 mg of ceftriaxone. Characterization of the system showed that it complied with the requirements for rectal administration, in particular rapid emulsification in a small quantity of liquid. Rabbit bioavailability showed rapid absorption of ceftriaxone, achieving 128% bioavailability compared to powder control formulation. These results demonstrated the potential of self-emulsifying formulations for rectal administration of Class 3 BCS drugs.

AB The objective was to investigate (trans) corneal and transscleral iontophoresis of biolabile amino acid ester prodrugs of aciclovir (ACV-X, X= Arg, Gly and Trp) as a means to increase ocular bioavailability of ACV. Prodrugs displayed tissue-dependent susceptibility to hydrolysis. Iontophoresis of ACV-Arg, ACV-Gly and ACVTrp (5 mM, 0.5 mA/cm(2)) for 5 min followed by 55 min passive diffusion resulted in appreciable corneal deposition (21.5 +/- 5.1, 14.1 +/- 2.0 and 5.3 +/- 0.6 nmol/cm(2), respectively) and transcorneal permeation (13.9 +/- 1.6, 10.9 +/- 1.8 and 5.7 +/- 0.5 nmol/cm(2), respectively) of ACV species. In contrast, passive delivery of ACV across porcine cornea after 1 h was < LOQ (i.e.< 0.125 nmol/cm(2)). Transscleral permeation of ACV-Arg, ACV-Gly and ACV-Trp (9 mM, 1.25 mA/cm(2)) after iontophoresis for 5 min was 20.4 +/- 3.8, 12.3 +/- 0.3 and 8.4 +/- 0.4 nmol/cm(2), respectively - far superior to passive delivery which was again < LOQ. Using intact porcine eye globes, 5 min transscleral iontophoresis of ACV-Gly at 3.75 mA/cm(2) resulted in considerable delivery of ACV species to the choroid/retina and vitreous humour (5.7 +/- 2.3 and 11.7 +/- 3.7 nmol/cm(2), respectively). Furthermore, the average concentration of ACV species in the whole eyeball (4.5 +/- 1.6 nmol/cm(3)) was significantly higher than the IC50 of ACV against HSV-1 (< 0.22 nmol/cm(3)), demonstrating the potential application for the treatment of ocular HSV infections.

AB Pharmaceutical powder flow can alter significantly based on the exposed humidity conditions, and lack of computational models to predict the same may undermine process development, optimization, and scale-up performances. A Discrete Element Model (DEM) is proposed to predict the effects of humidity on pharmaceutical powder flow by altering the cohesive forces based on granular bond numbers in simple hopper geometries. Experiments analogous to the simulations are further performed for three commonly used pharmaceutical excipients at 20%, 40% and 60% RH. The equivalent DEM based bond numbers to predict the powder flow tendencies are in good accordance with the experimental results and can be a useful tool to predict the outcomes of different pharmaceutical processing techniques at various humidity conditions.

AB Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating disease. Despite the historical use of interferon-beta (IFN-beta) for the treatment of patients with MS, concerns exist regarding the side effects of IFN-beta. In this study, we designed a series of novel IFN-beta fusion proteins containing galectin-9 (gal-9), which exerts immunosuppressive effects through the binding to its receptor on activated Th1 cells. We hypothesized that these fusion proteins would improve the therapeutic effects and reduce the side effects of IFN-beta. The IFN-beta-gal-9 fusion proteins showed less IFN-beta biological activity on non-T cells than IFN-beta alone. In vitro experiments using re-stimulated T cells isolated from mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) showed that the IFN-beta-gal-9 fusion proteins suppressed activated T cells more effectively than IFN-beta. Moreover, in our in vivo experiments, the gene transfer of IFN-beta-gal-9 fusion protein-expressing plasmid DNA into EAE mice showed beneficial therapeutic effects without cytopenia, a known side effect of IFN-beta. In contrast, the gene transfer of IFN-beta-expressing plasmid DNA induced a rapid decrease in the white blood cell count, despite its therapeutic effect. These results indicate that gene therapy using IFN-beta-gal-9 fusion proteins is expected to be safe and effective for the treatment of MS.

AB This study investigates engineered carrier, as well as engineered API particles, and shows that there are distinct performance indicators of particle engineering for carrier-based dry powder inhalers (DPIs). Spray dried (SDSS) and jet-milled (JMSS) salbutamol sulphate (SS) was blended with untreated a-lactose monohydrate (LAC_R) and a-lactose monohydrate engineered (LAC_E). Subsequent capsule filling was performed with different process settings on a dosator nozzle capsule filling machine in order to reach a target fill weight of 20-25 mg. To evaluate the performance of the different mixtures, in vitro lung deposition experiments were carried out with a next generation impactor, the emitted dose (ED) and fine particle fraction (FPF) were calculated based on the specification of the European pharmacopoeia. The FPF of micronised powder blends is significantly higher (20%) compared to the FPF of spray dried blends (5%). Compared to API engineering, carrier engineering had a positive effect on the capsule filling performance (weight variability and mean fill weight) at lower compression ratios (setting 1). Results further showed that higher compression ratios appear to be beneficial in terms of capsule filling performance (higher fill weight and less fill weight variation). Concluding, it can be stated that the carrier engineering, or generally carrier properties, govern downstream processing, whereas the API engineering and API properties govern the aerosolisation performance and thereby significantly affect the dose delivery to the lungs.

AB Two grades of commercial AFFINISOL (TM) HPMC HME were used as polymer binders to explore the influence of polymer viscosity and concentration on a novel heat assisted dry granulation process with a twin screw extruder. Contributions of other non-binder ingredients in the formulations were also studied for lactose, microcrystalline cellulose and an active pharmaceutical ingredient of caffeine. As sensitive indicators of processing conditions that expose the drug to high internally generated heat, dehydration of a-lactose monohydrate and polymorphic transformation of caffeine were monitored by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Additionally, any decomposition of caffeine was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Granular samples were characterized by particle size, circularity, fracture strength and their temperature on the exit of extruder. Higher screw speed and lower feed rate were found to help particles agglomerate by allowing feed particles a greater opportunity to increase in temperature. Lower binder molecular weight and higher binder concentration enable granules to build stronger strength and thereby lead to higher particle size. This new twin screw dry granulation was demonstrated as offering advantages over conventional hot melt granulation by minimizing thermal degradation of the tested ingredients.

AB Dermal delivery of hydrophobic drugs by microemulsion (ME) formulations and effect from ME microstructures were studied. Anti-fungal drug, clotrimazole (CLOT), was used as the model compound. ME formulations possessing different microstructures were prepared using a ME system that contains isopropyl myristate as oil, Labrasol and Cremophor EL as surfactant and co-surfactant, and water. Permeation experiments on human cadaver skin were conducted for ME and the control formulations of different CLOT concentrations. Dermal delivery of CLOT assessed by the dermal tissue drug concentration was found to be significantly higher for MEs when compared with the control formulation, evidenced by dermal retention Enhancement Ratio (ERD) of 5.1, 2.8, and 3.0 for tested O/W, bi-continuous, and W/O MEs, respectively. The highest concentration was observed with O/W ME, suggesting the ME microstructure is an important formulation variable for enhancing dermal delivery efficiency. ME gel formulations prepared by incorporating 1.0%(w/w) of Carbopol980 showed comparable dermal CLOT concentration to MEs, but up to 2.4 fold higher than the commercial CLOT cream product, Lotrimin (R). Furthermore, Fluorescein Isothiocynate (FITC), used as a model compound for highly hydrophobic drugs, was also studied for dermal delivery by MEs, and results show consistent ME microstructure effect, suggested by significantly higher FITC concentrations in all skin layers, SC, viable epidermis, and dermis, from O/W ME over bi-continuous and W/O MEs.

AB Many of the lipids and surfactants used to prepare the self-emulsified nanoemulsion (SEN) are subjected to the gastro-intestinal enzymatic digestion, which may affect the absorption of the loaded drug. The present study was to investigate the impact of such digestion on the transport of hydrophilic macromolecules (10-kDa dextran as the model compound) loaded in SEN through the MDCK cell monolayer and ex-vivo rat intestines. FITC-labeled dextran (FD) was loaded inside the inner oil phase of SEN by the formation of FD-phospholipid solid dispersion (FDPS). After digestion, the droplet size increased from 31.06 +/- 2.10 nm to 494.6 +/- 22.1 nm, and the FD content in the external aqueous phase increased from 41.6 +/- 4.2% to 61.1 +/- 4.4%. Compared to the FD solution, SEN without digestion enhanced the transport of FD through MDCK cell monolayer 4.1 times and through rat intestines 3.0-7.4 times. However, the digestion reduced the transport of FD 3.5 times through MDCK cell monolayer and 1.3-2.0 times through rat intestines, compared to that without digestion. This reduction was due to the destruction of lipid nano-droplets and release of FD to the external aqueous phase of SEN. This finding should be considered when SEN is used as a delivery system for hydrophilic macromolecules.

AB Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles containing progesterone were prepared by the solvent extraction/evaporation and microfluidic techniques. Microparticles were characterized by their size distribution, encapsulation efficiency, morphology and thermal properties. The effect of particle size, polydispersity and polymer degradation on the in vitro release of the hormone was studied. A triphasic release profile was observed for larger microparticles, while smaller microspheres showed a biphasic release profile. This behavior is related to the fact that complete drug release was achieved in a few days for smaller microparticles, during which polymer degradation effects are still negligible. A mathematical model was developed that predicts the progesterone release profiles from different-sized PLGA microspheres. The model takes into account both the dissolution and diffusion of the drug in the polymeric matrix as well as the autocatalytic effect of polymer degradation. The model was adjusted and validated with novel experimental data. Simulation results are in very good agreement with experimental results.

AB Tablets are the most common solid dosage form of pharmaceutical active ingredients due to their ease of use. Their dissolution behaviour depends on the particle size distribution and physicochemical properties of the formulation, and the compression process, which need to be optimised for producing consistently robust tablets, as weaker tablets are often prone to breakage during production, transport and end use. Tablet strength is typically determined by diametric compression and friability tests. The former gives rise to propagation of a crack on a plane along the compression axis, whilst the latter, carried out in a rotating drum, incurs surface damage and produces chips and debris. These tests produce different measures of strength, neither of which have been correlated with mechanical properties that are accountable for breakage, i.e. hardness, elastic modulus and fracture toughness. We propose a new method based on single tablet impact testing, following the work of Ghadiri and Zhang, 2002, who analysed particle damage by propagation of sub-surface lateral cracks and identified the fundamental form accountable for impact surface damage to be a lumped parameter related to hardness and fracture toughness. Microindentation, carried out separately, to determine fracture toughness led to complete failure of the tablets, hence an unreliable measurement of fracture toughness and no correlation with the experimental trend. In addition, by assuming the fracture toughness to be proportional to the square root of Young's modulus, the indentation measurements do not correlate well with the impact breakage. The discrepancy between the impact and indentation methods is expected to be due to mechanical property variation across the tablet surface, and with strain rate. The impact method is a more suitable test to describe tablet propensity for attrition as it directly represents the failure mode tablets may experience during processing under well-defined conditions. In contrast, the friability test subjects tablets to a similar breakage mechanism but under less well-defined conditions, whilst the compression test represents a different failure mode that is not representative of stresses incurred during processing.

AB In this study, a shipping protocol for our 3D human hemicornea (HC) construct should be developed to provide quality-maintaining shipping conditions and to allow its ready-to-use application in drug absorption studies. First, the effects of single and multiple parameters, such as the type of shipping container, storage temperature and CO2 supply, were investigated under controlled laboratory conditions by assessing cell viability via MTT dye reaction and epithelial barrier properties via transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements. These investigations showed that TEER is more susceptible to shipping parameters than cell viability. Furthermore, the results were used to determine the optimal shipping conditions and critical values for subsequent overnight, real-time shipping experiments. Epithelial barrier properties were then investigated via TEER and the permeation of sodium fluorescein for shipped and not shipped HC. The results underscore that acceleration forces and changes in position may have a great impact on the epithelial barrier of 3D models. Low acceleration values and short changes in position caused only minor impairments. However, combined or intensive separate effects resulted in considerably low yields after shipping. Consequently, barrier-maintaining shipping of 3D in vitro models seems to be challenging, as mechanical forces have to be reduced to a minimum.

AB Liposomal delivery is a well-established approach to increase the therapeutic index of drugs, mainly in the field of cancer chemotherapy. Here, we report the preparation and characterization of a new liposomal formulation of a derivative of lomeguatrib, a potent O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) inactivator. The drug had been tested in clinical trials to revert chemoresistance, but was associated with a low therapeutic index. A series of lomeguatrib conjugates with distinct alkyl chain lengths - i.e. C12, C14, C16, and C18 - was synthesized, and the MGMT depleting activity as well as cytotoxicity were determined on relevant mouse and human glioma cell lines. Drug-containing liposomes were prepared and characterized in terms of loading and in vitro release kinetics. The lipophilic lomeguatrib conjugates did not exert cytotoxic effects at 5 mu M in the mouse glioma cell line and exhibited a similar MGMT depleting activity pattern as lomeguatrib. Overall, drug loading could be improved by up to 50-fold with the lipophilic conjugates, and the slowest leakage was achieved with the C18 derivative. The present data show the applicability of lipophilic lomeguatrib derivatization for incorporation into liposomes, and identify the C18 derivative as the lead compound for in vivo studies.

AB The objective of this study was to develop oral disintegrating tablet (ODT) formulations of a heptapeptide, [Lys(5), MeLeu(9), Nle(10)]-NKA(4-10), for the treatment of neurogenic bladder dysfunction. A design of experiment approach was applied to determine the optimal ratio of chosen excipients: gelatin (X-1), glycine (X-2), and sorbitol (X-3). These formulations were optimized for efficacy studies to produce ODTs exhibiting rapid disintegration times (Y-1) and appropriate structural integrity (Y-2) using JMP((R)) 12.0.1 software. Based on theoretically predicted values from 12 experimental runs, the optimal ODT formulation was determined to be 3% (w/v) gelatin, 2% (w/v) glycine, and 1% (w/v) sorbitol in deionized water. Using this formulation, blank and drug-loaded ODTs containing 1.5 mg or 5 mg of [Lys(5), MeLeu(9), Nle(10)]-NKA(4-10) were manufactured by a lyophilization process. The peptide-loaded tablets disintegrated in less than 30 s and released 97% of the peptide within 15 min. The peptide was stable for 90 days under 25 degrees C/60% relative humidity (RH) and 40 degrees C/75% RH. In vivo efficacy of the peptide-loaded ODTs was confirmed in a rat acute spinal cord injury model under isovolumetric bladder pressure recording conditions, concluding that sublingual administration of peptide-containing ODTs evoke a rapid doserelated neurokinin 2-mediated increase in bladder pressure.

AB In this study, the dissolution behaviour of dipyridamole (DPM) and cinnarizine (CNZ) spray-dried amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) using polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) as a carrier matrix were evaluated and compared. The drug concentrations achieved from the dissolution of PVP and PAA solid dispersions were significantly greater than the equilibrium solubility of crystalline DPM and CNZ in phosphate buffer pH 6.8 (PBS 6.8). The maximum drug concentration achieved by dissolution of PVP and PAA solid dispersions did not exceed the theoretically calculated apparent solubility of amorphous DPM and CNZ. However, the degree of supersaturation of DPM and CNZ increased considerably as the polymer weight fraction within the solid dispersion increased. In addition, the supersaturation profile of DPM and CNZ were studied in the presence and absence of the polymers. PAA was found to maintain a higher level of supersaturation compared to PVP. The enhanced drug solution concentration following dissolution of ASDs can be attributed to the reduced crystal growth rates of DPM and CNZ at an equivalent supersaturation. We have also shown that, for drugs having high crystallization tendency and weak drug-polymer interaction, the feasible way to increase dissolution might be increase the polymer weight fraction in the ASD. Solution H-1 NMR spectra were used to understand dissolution mechanism and to identify drug-polymer interaction. The change in electron densities of proton attached to different groups in DPM and CNZ suggested drug-polymer interaction in solution. The relative intensities of peak shift and nature of interaction between drug and polymer in different systems are different. These different effects suggest that DPM and CNZ interacts in a different way with PVP and PAA in solution which goes some way towards explaining the different polymeric effect, particularly in terms of inhibition of drug recrystallization and dissolution of DPM and CNZ ASDs. These results established that the different drug/polymer interactions in the solid state and in solution give rise to the variation in dissolution profile observed for different systems.

AB Polydiacetylene (pDA) micelles have been demonstrated to be effective drug carriers for cancer therapy in mouse model. However, little is known about their interaction with the human complement system, which constitutes an important part of the innate immune system and can cause severe hypersensitivity reactions. Herein, we investigate the influence of micelle surface charge on the binding of complement protein C1q, the target recognition unit that activates the classical complement pathway and performs a range of other important physiological functions. Besides the classical pathway, we also investigate the surface charge effect on complement activities through the other activation pathways, namely, the MBL-dependent lectin pathway and the alternative pathway. We synthesized three samples of pDA micelles bearing neutral, anionic, and cationic surface charge motifs, respectively. Surface plasmon resonance showed that none of these micelles interacted with C1q. Results from serum complement activation assays indicated that all micelles were inert to complement, except for the anionic pDA micelles, which activated the alternative pathway.

In this study, xanthan gum was chosen as rate-controlling polymer for the development of alcohol resistant matrix formulations and theophylline as model drug. Two polymer particle sizes (75 and 180 mu m) and concentrations (30 and 60% w/w) were used to assess their influence on the in-vitro drug release from directly compressed tablets and mini-tablets, in 0% and 40% ethanol for 2 h (pH 1.2). For both, tablets and mini-tablets, by using 60% xanthan gum similar dissolution profiles in hydrous and hydroalcoholic media were obtained, independently of the polymer particle size. By decreasing the polymer concentration a risk of alcohol-induced dose dumping was recognised, however only when larger polymer particles were used. In particular, mini-tablets underwent disintegration and released the entire dose within 5 min in alcohol. Nevertheless, finer polymer particles used at lower concentration led to the formation of a more coherent and less porous gel layer and alcohol resistance could be tailored in regard to both matrix tablets and mini-tablets.

AB This study demonstrates the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to simultaneously characterize the roughness of the tablet core and coating of pharmaceutical tablets. OCT is a high resolution non-destructive and contactless imaging methodology to characterize structural properties of solid dosage forms. Besides measuring the coating thickness, it also facilitates the analysis of the tablet core and coating roughness. An automated data evaluation algorithm extracts information about coating thickness, as well as tablet core and coating roughness. Samples removed periodically from a pan coating process were investigated, on the basis of thickness and profile maps of the tablet core and coating computed from about 480,000 depth measurements (i.e., 3D data) per sample. This data enables the calculation of the root mean square deviation, the skewness and the kurtosis of the assessed profiles. Analyzing these roughness parameters revealed that, for the given coating formulation, small valleys in the tablet core are filled with coating, whereas coarse features of the tablet core are still visible on the final film-coated tablet. Moreover, the impact of the tablet core roughness on the coating thickness is analyzed by correlating the tablet core profile and the coating thickness map. The presented measurement method and processing could be in the future transferred to in-line OCT measurements, to investigate core and coating roughness during the production of film-coated tablets.

AB Spray drying is a well-established scale-up technique for the production of cocrystals. However, to the best of our knowledge, the effect of introducing a third component into the feed solution during the spray drying process has never been investigated. Cocrystal formation in the presence of a third component by a one-step spray drying process has the potential to reduce the number of unit operations which are required to produce a final pharmaceutical product (e.g. by eliminating blending with excipient). Sulfadimidine (SDM), a poorly water soluble active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), and 4-aminosalicylic acid (4ASA), a hydrophilic molecule, were used as model drug and coformer respectively to form cocrystals by spray drying in the presence of a third component (excipient). The solubility of the cocrystal in the excipient was measured using a thermal analysis approach. Trends in measured solubility were in agreement with those determined by calculated Hansen Solubility Parameter (HSP) values. The ratio of cocrystal components to excipient was altered and cocrystal formation at different weight ratios was assessed. Cocrystal integrity was preserved when the cocrystal components were immiscible with the excipient, based on the difference in Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSP). For immiscible systems (difference in HSP > 9.6 MPa0.5), cocrystal formation occurred even when the proportion of excipient was high (90% w/w). When the excipient was partly miscible with the cocrystal components, cocrystal formation was observed post spray drying, but crystalline API and coformer were also recovered in the processed powder. An amorphous dispersion was formed when the excipient was miscible with the cocrystal components even when the proportion of excipient used as low (10% w/w excipient). For selected spray dried cocrystal-excipient systems an improvement in tableting characteristics was observed, relative to equivalent physical mixtures.

AB G0/G1 switch gene 2 plays an important role in the regulation of lipolysis in mammals, but little is known about its gene (GOS2) structure and function in fish. In the present study, two genes, GOS2a and GOS2b were isolated and characterized from grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella, which encode peptides of 111 and 84 amino acids, respectively. Moreover, alternative multiple exon usage resulted in a significant variation in the 5'-region of GOS2a transcripts yielding two isoforms (GOS2a1 and GOS2a2). Phylogenetic and synteny analyses indicated that GOS2a and GOS2b could have originated from the teleost-specific genome duplication event. Analysis of the exon intron structures clarified that GOS2a contained an extra intron compared with GOS2b. GOS2a1, GOS2a2 and GOS2b mRNAs were highly expressed in adipose tissue and liver. GOS2a was localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus, while GOS2b was mainly localized in cytoplasm, suggesting that GOS2a and GOS2b may have different functions in grass carp. PPAR alpha agonist caused an increase in GOS2a1 and GOS2b expression, revealing that they are subject to transcriptional control by PPAR alpha-mediated signals. TNF-alpha treatment decreased GOS2a1 and GOS2a2 transcripts that paralleled TNF-alpha downregulation of PPAR alpha; however, only the effects of TNF-alpha on GOS2a1 were attenuated by treatment with PPAR alpha agonist. Our findings identify GOS2a, not GOS2b, as a target gene for TNF-alpha and reveal that TNF-alpha suppresses GOS2a1 gene expression through a PPAR alpha-dependent pathway in grass carp hepatocytes.

AB CMS, which refers to the inability to generate functional pollen grains while still producing a normal gynoecium, has been widely used for pepper hybrid seed production. Pepper line 8214A is an excellent CMS line exhibiting 100% male sterility and superior economic characteristics. A TUNEL assay revealed the nuclear DNA is damaged in 8214A PMCs during meiosis. TEM images indicated that the 8214A PMCs exhibited asynchronous meiosis after prophase I, and some PMCs degraded prematurely with morphological features typical of PCD. Additionally, at the end of meiosis, the 8214A PMCs formed abnormal non-tetrahedral tetrads that degraded in situ. To identify the genes involved in the pollen abortion of line 8214A, the transcriptional profiles of the 8214A and the 8214B anthers (i.e., from the fertile maintainer line) during meiosis were analyzed using an RNA-seq approach. A total of 1355 genes were determined to be differentially expressed, including 424 and 931 up- and down-regulated genes, respectively, in the 8214A anthers during meiosis relative to the expression levels in the 8214B. The expression levels of ubiquitin ligase and cell cycle-related genes were apparently down-regulated, while the expression of methyltransferase genes was up-regulated in the 8214A anthers during meiosis, which likely contributed to the PCD of these PMCs during meiosis. Thus, our results may be useful for revealing the molecular mechanism regulating the pollen abortion of CMS pepper.

AB Globally, there is an alarming decline in sperm count. Very often hormonal supplementation fails to restore normal sperm count. Sertoli cells (Sc) present within seminiferous tubules provide appropriate niche and factors required for the differentiation of germ cells (Gc) into mature sperm (spermatogenesis). Functionally compromised Sc may be one of the reasons for failure of hormones to facilitate normal spermatogenesis. Although role of secretory proteins and signaling molecules of Sc has been studied well, role of transcription factors regulating sperm count has not been addressed appropriately. Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR)-alpha is one of such transcription factors reported in testis but its role in testicular function is not yet known. In a separate study, we found abundant ROR-alpha binding sites on promoter regions of several genes upregulated in pubertal rat Sc as compared to infant Sc. Immunostaining studies also revealed presence of ROR alpha in nucleus of pubertal Sc. We generated a transgenic knockdown rat model expressing shRNA targeted to ROR-alpha under Sc specific promoter, which is transcriptionally active only at and after puberty. ROR-alpha knockdown animals were found to have abnormal association of Sc and Gc, including Gc sloughing and restricted release of sperm. The knockdown animals displayed compromised spermatogenesis leading to significant reduction in sperm count. This is the first report describing the Sc specific role of ROR-alpha in maintaining quantitatively normal sperm output. Identification of various such molecules can generate avenues to limit or reverse an alarmingly declining sperm count witnessed globally in men.

AB Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a chronic debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder with multiple risk factors involving numerous complex genetic influences. We examined and updated a master list of clinically relevant and susceptibility genes associated with SCZ reported in the literature and genomic databases dedicated to gene discovery for characterization of SCZ genes. We used the commercially available GeneAnalytics computer-based gene analysis program and integrated genomic databases to create a molecular profile of the updated list of 608 SCZ genes to model their impact in select categories (tissues and cells, diseases, pathways, biological processes, molecular functions, phenotypes and compounds) using specialized GeneAnalytics algorithms. Genes for schizophrenia were predominantly expressed in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, medulla oblongata, thalamus and hypothalamus Psychiatric/behavioral disorders incorporating SCZ genes included ADHD, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder and alcohol dependence as well as cancer, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, sleep disturbances and inflammation. Function based analysis of major biological pathways and mechanisms associated with SCZ genes identified glutaminergic receptors (e.g., GRIA1, GRIN2, GRIK4, GRM5), serotonergic receptors (e.g., HTR2A, HTR2C), GABAergic receptors (e.g., GABRA1, GABRB2), dopaminergic receptors (e.g., DRD1, DRD2), calcium-related channels (e.g., CACNA1H, CACNA1B), solute transporters (e.g., SLC1A1, SLC6A2) and for neurodevelopment (e.g., ADCY1, MEF2C, NOTCH2, SHANK3). Biological mechanisms involving synaptic transmission, regulation of membrane potential and transmembrane ion transport were identified as leading molecular functions associated with SCZ genes. Our approach to interrogate SCZ genes and their interactions at various levels has increased our knowledge and insight into the disease process possibly opening new avenues for therapeutic intervention.

AB The 9p21.3 region is rich in regulatory elements and the variants in this region had been robustly associated with carotid plaque (CP) and coronary artery disease (CAD). Recently, the HACD4 was detected as one of the six 9p21.3 differentially expressed genes associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and greater mean lesion area in the Athsq1 congenic mice. We aimed to investigate association of two potentially regulatory HACD4 variants (rs36212560 I/D, rs2275888 T/C) and their haplotypes with CP occurrence and the level of HACD4 and FOCAD mRNA in human CP tissue. Association study was replicated in CAD patients who suffered the first myocardial infarction. Study included 477 CP patients, 303 healthy controls and replication sample of 224 CAD males from the population of Serbia. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR using TaqMan (R) technology. The gene expression was detected with TaqMan (R) technology. We have found significant and independent association of DT haplotype with CP presence in men (adjusted OR = 1.64 CI = 1.12-2.42, p = 0.011). The result was replicated in CAD males (adjusted OR = 1.84 CI = 1.21-2.80, p = 0.004). We have found significant effect of the HACD4 rs2275888 on FOCAD mRNA level in human CP tissue. Correction for multiple testing was performed.

AB Objective: To see the role of IL-1 beta gene polymorphisms to disease susceptibility in Indian SLE patients.
   Materials and methods: This case-control study included 200 SLE patients and 201 controls. Serum levels of IL-1 beta and anti-C1q antibodies were measured by multiplex immunoassay and ELISA respectively. Genotyping of SNPs in IL-1 beta (-511C/T and + 3954C/T) were performed by PCR-RFLP method. Autoantibody profile was done in 141 SLE patients.
   Results: Mean serum levels of IL-1 beta were significantly higher (10.9 +/- 5.3 pg/ml) in patients compared to controls (7.0 +/- 2.0 pg/ml) (p < 0.0001). Similarly, mean levels of IL-1 beta were significantly elevated among patients with renal and hematologic manifestations. IL-1 beta levels were negatively correlated with hemoglobin concentration (r = 0.25, p = 0.001). A statistically significant difference was observed for IL-1 beta -511CC genotypes (OR = 2.9, p = 0.0068, Pc = 0.0136) in patients with Lupus Nephritis (LN) as compared to SLE patients without nephritis. The IL-1 beta + 3954CT genotype (OR = 2.0, p = 0.0032, Pc = 0.0064) and + 3954T allele (OR = 1.9, p = 0.0017, Pc = 0.0034) showed significantly higher frequency among patients as compared to controls. Furthermore, the -511C allele showed higher prevalence in patients with renal (OR = 1.6, p = 0.0335) and hematologic (OR = 1.6, p = 0.0326) manifestations among SLE patients.
   Conclusion: IL-1 beta gene polymorphisms appear to confer susceptibility to the disease in Indian SLE patients.

AB The evolution of apolipoprotein B (Apob) has been intensely researched due to its importance during lipid transport. Mammalian full-length apob100 can be post-transcriptionally edited by the enzyme apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like complex-one (Apobec1) resulting in a truncated Apob, known as Apob48. Whilst both full-length and truncated forms of Apob are important for normal lipid homeostasis in mammals, there is no evidence for the presence of apob mRNA editing prior to the divergence of the mammals, yet, non-mammalian vertebrates appear to function normally with only Apob100. To date, the majority of the research carried out in non-mammalian vertebrates has focused on chickens with only a very limited number examining apob mRNA editing in fish. This study focused on the molecular evolution of Apobec1 and Apob in order to ascertain if apob mRNA editing occurs in eels, a basal teleost which represents an evolutionarily important animal group. No evidence for the presence of Apobec1 or the ability for eel apob to be edited was found. However, an important link between mutant mice and the evident hypertriglyceridemia in the plasma of non mammalian vertebrates was made. This study has provided imperative evidence to help bridge the evolutionary gap between fish and mammals and provides further support for the lack of apob mRNA editing in non-mammalian vertebrates.

AB The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1 beta) is a key mediator of inflammation which affects cell proliferation and differentiation. IL-1 beta is considered to contribute to the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Polymorphisms in cytokine genes are highly influenced by ethnicity. Hence, in this study polymorphism of the IL1B-511(C/T) within promoter region was analyzed by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in 187 RA patients and 214 controls. The prevalence of different genotypes and allelic frequency distribution was compared in RA patients and controls. Levels of inflammatory markers and serum levels of IL-1 beta were estimated by ELISA The serum inflammatory markers levels were significantly higher in RA patients as compared to controls (RF = 127.3 +/- 21.3 U/mL, Anti-CCP = 17.8 +/- 8.3 U/mL, CRP = 17.86 +/- 7.1 mg/L and IL-1 beta = 21.25 +/- 4.19 pg/mL in RA patients p < 0.01). The frequency of heterozygous mutant (C/T) and homozygous mutant (T/T) variants were significantly higher in RA patients as compared to controls and the odds ratios by logistic regression were (OR = 2.2, p < 0.001) and (OR = 3.21, p < 0.01) respectively. The association persisted on combining the heterozygous mutant and homozygous mutant (CT + TT) together as compared to controls (OR = 2.39; p < 0.001). Positive and significant (p < 0.05) correlation of circulating IL-1 beta levels with RF (r = 0.232), anti-CCP (r = 0.207) and CRP (r = 0.166) among RA patients were found. The levels of anti-CCP were significantly higher in homozygous mutant variants (TT) as well as the heterozygous mutant variants (C/T) in comparison to the wild variants (CC) (p < 0.01). The results of this study reveal that mutant allele (T) of IL1B-511 promoter SNP tends to be associated with elevated anti-CCP and IL-1 beta levels as observed in RA patients and hence disease susceptibility.

AB Papillorenal syndrome (PRS), an autosomal dominant inherited condition, is clinically featured by renal hypoplasia and optic nerve dysplasia. Based on current knowledge of genotype-phenotype correlations in PRS, mutations in the Paired box 2 (PAX2) gene have been recognized as a critical pathogenesis of typical renal and optic disease manifestations. However, little information is currently available on the skeletal abnormalities of PRS and the potential contribution of PAX2 mutations. Here, we present a case of a 10-year-old female PRS patient with the typical features of chronic renal failure and severe myopia, but was unexpectedly discovered camptodactyly of her left middle finger which affects the proximal interphalangeal joint. Pathologically, the camptodactyly was further indicated by radiology as a skeletal deformity, demonstrating a decline of bone mineral density and disappearance of joint space. Molecular diagnostics revealed a heterozygous mutation, 220_225dup, in the exon 3 of her PAX2 gene, which is de novo considering the lack of this mutation in her non consanguineous parents. This mutation leads to duplication of glutamic acid at position 74 and tyrosine at position 75 in PAX2 protein, which may influence the DNA-binding function. Besides, the absence of Spoilt like transcription factor 4 (SALL4) mutation excluded the diagnosis of acro-renal-ocular syndrome (AROS), of which clinical characteristics are similar to our patient's. This case unravels a previously unrecognized phenotype of camptodactyly due to a significant skeletal deformity of PRS with a heterogeneous PAX2 mutation of hexanucleotide duplication. This report challenges against the current belief of genotype-phenotype correlations in PRS.

AB The H19 transcript (imprinted maternally expressed transcript) is well-known as long noncoding RNA (1ncRNA), and it is thought to be associated with the inductive capacity of dermal papilla cells for hair-follicle reconstruction. In this study, we isolated and characterized a 1ncRNA-H19 transcript from the secondary hair follicle of Liaoning cashmere goat. Also, we investigated its transcriptional pattern and methylation status of H19 gene in secondary hair follicle of this breed during different stages of hair follicle cycle. Nucleotide composition analysis indicated that guanine (G) and cytosine (C) are the dominant nucleotides in the IncRNA-H19 transcript of Liaoning cashmere goat with the highest frequency distribution (11.25%) of GG nucleotide pair. The regulatory network showed that IncRNA-H19 transcript appears to have remarkably diverse regulatory relationships with its related miRNAs and the potential target genes. In secondary hair follicle, the relative expression of 1ncRNA-H19 transcript at the anagen phase is significantly higher than that at both telogen and catagen phases suggesting that lncRNA-H19 transcript might play essential roles in the formation and growth of cashmere fiber of goat. Methylation analysis indicated that the methylation of the promoter region of H19 gene most likely participates in its transcriptional suppression in secondary hair follicle of Liaoning cashmere goat.

AB Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is an X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the NR3C4 gene, which encodes the androgen receptor (AR). In this study, we performed mutational analyses to identify AR molecular defects, in individuals with 46,XY disorders of sex development (46,XY DSD) and a presumptive diagnosis of AIS. Eighteen different gene mutations, including seven previously unreported new variants, were detected in 26 unrelated cases. These included two deletion mutations (P49fs*1.85 and E308f*320) in exon 1 and five substitution mutations (p.S792P, p.D829G, p.R832P, p.L839F, and p.K906E) located in the steroid-binding domain. Expression analyses of mutants generated by site-directed mutagenesis indicated that these new gene variants impaired AR function by affecting its binding activity. Seventeen of 18 mutations likely lead to reduced or absent responses to androgens, which may in turn account for the different degrees of undermasculinization observed. Our study provides insight into the functional consequences of these mutations.

AB Compared with numerous studies of somatic mutations using sporadic lung cancer, the research into germline mutations using familial lung cancer (FLC) is limited. In the present study, we used FLC samples obtained from the Chinese population in highly air-polluted regions to screen for novel germline mutations in lung cancer. Through a whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis of the nine subjects (four lung cancer patients and five normal family members of FLC), we obtairied a whole genome dataset of DNA alterations in FLC samples. A total of 1218 genes were identified with mutations of multiple types. Subsequently, the top 12 highly mutated genes were selected for validation by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing in an expanded sample set including FLC, sporadic lung cancer, and healthy population. Mutations of the five genes (ARHGEF5, ANKRD20A2, ZNF595, ZNF812, MYOI8B) may be potential germline mutations of lung cancer. We also analyzed specific mutations within the 12 genes and found that some specific mutations within the MUC12, FOXD4L3 and FOXD4L5 genes showed higher frequencies in the samples of FLC and/or lung cancer tissue, compared with the healthy population. Moreover, some genes with copy number variation may be potentially associated with a predisposition to lung cancer. Furthermore, non-coding DNA alterations of the WGS data in FLC were systematically analyzed and arranged. Interestingly, we found that germline mutations also occurred in many genes of non-coding RNA. This study uncovered the mutation spectrum in FLC and provided important clues for the evaluation of the genetic susceptibility to lung cancer.

AB Skeletal muscle serving as the major organ is responsible for energy expenditure and exercise endurance, which directly influence cardiometabolic risk factors. Transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8), a Ca2+ permeable non-selective cation channel, plays vital roles in the regulation of various cellular functions. It has been reported that TRPM8 activation enhanced the energy metabolism of adipocytes. However, the involvement of TRPM8 in the energy metabolism of skeletal muscle remains unexplored. Our data revealed that TRPM8 was expressed in cultured C2C12 myocytes. Menthol treatment increased uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1 alpha) expression in C2C12 myotubes through TRPM8 activation. Moreover, dietary menthol upregulated the expression of UCP1 and PGC1 alpha in skeletal muscle of mice. In addition, dietary menthol enhanced exercise endurance and reduced blood lactic acid and triglycerides through TRPM8 activation. It is concluded that dietary menthol improves energy metabolism and exercise endurance by increasing UCP1 and PGCla in skeletal muscles, suggesting dietary menthol might be a novel therapeutic approach for cardiometabolic diseases management and prevention.

AB EAF (ELL Associated Factor) proteins interact with the transcription elongation factor, ELL (Eleven nineteen Lysine rich Leukemia) and enhance its ability to stimulate RNA polymerase II-mediated transcriptional elongation in vitro. Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains a single homolog of EAF (SpEAF), which is not essential for survival of S. pombe in contrast to its essential higher eukaryotic homologs. The physiological role of SpEAF is not well understood. In this study, we show that S. pombe EAF is important in regulating growth of S. pombe cells during normal growth conditions. Moreover, SpEAF is also essential for survival under conditions of DNA damage, while its deletion does not affect growth under environmental stress conditions. Our in vivo structure function studies further demonstrate that while both the amino and carboxyl terminal domains of SpEAF possess the potential to activate transcription, only the amino terminal domain of SpEAF is involved in interaction with the S. pombe ELL protein. The carboxyl-terminus of SpEAF is required for rescue of the growth defect under normal and DNA damaging conditions that is associated with the absence of SpEAF. Using bioinformatics and circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that the carboxyl-terminus of SpEAF has a disordered conformation. Furthermore, addition of trifluoroethanol triggered its transition from a disordered to a-helical conformation. Taken together, the results presented here identify novel structural and functional features of SpEAF protein, providing insights into how EAF proteins may enforce transcriptional control of gene expression.

AB We investigated the link between polymorphisms in genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC1 alpha) and further studied the role of these genes on the pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This case-control study was carried out in 118 PCOS cases and 110 controls. In the present study we genotyped three polymorphisms of PGC1-alpha gene (rs8192678-Gly482Ser, rs13131226 and rs2970856) and polymorphism of TFAM gene (rs1937-+35G/C) by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCRRFLP) analysis. In addition, to better understand genetic contributions to the pathophysiology of PCOS, mtDNA copy number (MCN) was quantified using a qRT-PCR assay in the subjects. The results revealed that the distribution of genotypes and allele frequency of the PGC-1 alpha Gly482Ser polymorphism in PCOS patients was statistically significant from those of the control group respectively (OR-2.488; 95% CI-1.0673 to 5.7998; P = 0.047), (OR-1.6091; 95% CI-1.0955 to 2.3634; P = 0.015) indicating that the presence of 'A' allele might confer risk to PCOS. Patients with the 'AA' genotype showed significantly lower levels of MCN compared with patients with other genotypes. In addition, patients carrying CT genotype of PGC1-alpha rs2970856 demonstrated significantly higher levels of LH (P = 0.030) than TT and CC genotypes. In conclusion, our study indicates that carriers of the PGC-1 alpha rs8192678 'Ser' allele have increased risk of developing PCOS.

AB Introduction: Nearly 2000 mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene have been reported. The F508de1 mutation occurs in approximately 50-65% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, molecular diagnosis is not always possible. Therefore, silent polymorphisms can be used to label the mutant allele in households of patients with CF.
   Objective: To verify the haplotypes of four polymorphisms at the CFTR locus in households of patients with CF for pre-fertilization, pre-implantation, and prenatal indirect mutation diagnosis to provide better genetic counseling for families and patients with CF and to associate the genotypes/haplotypes with the F508del mutation screening.
   Methods: GATT polymorphism analysis was performed using direct polymerase chain reaction amplification, and the MP6-D9, TUB09 and TUB18 polymorphism analyses were performed using restriction fragment length polymorphism.
   Results: Nine haplotypes were found in 37 CFTR alleles, and of those, 24 were linked with the F508de1 mutation and 13 with other CFTR mutations. The 6 (GATT), C (MP6-D9), G (TUB09), and C (TUB18) haplotypes showed the highest prevalence (48%) of the mutant CFTR allele and were linked to the F508de1 mutation (64%). In 43% of households analyzed, at least one informative polymorphism can be used for the indirect diagnostic test.
   Conclusion: CFTR polymorphisms are genetic markers that are useful for identifying the mutant CFTR alleles in households of patients with CF when it is not possible to establish the complete CFTR genotype. Moreover, the polymorphisms can be used for indirect CFTR mutation identification in cases of pre-fertilization, pre-implantation and prenatal analysis.

AB Syndromic craniosynostosis is a group of multiple conditions with high heterogeneity, and many rare syndromes still remain to be characterized. To identify and analyze causative genetic variants in nine unrelated probands mainly manifested as syndromic craniosynostosis, we reviewed the relevant medical information of the patients and performed the whole exome sequencing, further verified with Sanger sequencing and parental background. Bioinformatics analysis was used to evaluate the potential deleterious or benign effect of each genetic variant through evolutionary conservation alignment, multi-lines of computer predication and the allele frequency in population dataset (control and patient). The Standards and guidelines from American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics was used to classify and interpret the pathogenicity for each genetic variant. All the nine probands were found to carry the possibly causative variants, among which three variants including two missense mutations (c.3385C > T in IFT122 gene, c.3581A > G in SMC1A gene) and a frameshift mutation (c.434dupA in TWISTI gene) have never been reported in patients before. We suggested Cornelia de Lange syndrome caused by SMC1A variant is a neglected syndromic craniosynostosis. Our study not only expanded genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of the rare syndromes, but also confirmed that there existed an underlying genetic mechanism. We emphasized that deliberate selection of both the potential candidates and comprehensive detection methods for genetic analysis is important to increase the genetic diagnosis yield of syndromic craninosynostosis.

AB Enhancers and insulators are involved in the regulation of gene expression, but the basic underlying mechanisms of action of these elements are unknown. We analyzed the individual effects of the enhancer and the insulator from Drosophila mobile elements copia [enh(copia)] and gypsy using transfected genetic constructs in S2 cells. This system excludes the influence of genomic cis regulatory elements. The enhancer-induced synthesis of 350-1050-nt-long enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and H3K4me3 and H3K18ac marks, mainly in the region located about 300 bp downstream of the enhancer. Insertion of the insulator between the enhancer and the promoter reduced these effects. We also observed the binding of dCTCF to the enhancer and to gypsy insulator. Our data indicate that a single gypsy insulator interacts with both the enhancer and the promoter, while two copies of the gypsy insulator preferentially interact with each other. Our results suggest the formation of chromatin loops that are shaped by the enhancer and the insulator.

AB Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are two component genetic modules widespread in many bacterial genomes, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). The TA systems play a significant role in biofilm formation, antibiotic tolerance and persistence of pathogen inside the host cells. Deciphering regulatory motifs of Mtb TA systems is the first essential step to understand their transcriptional regulation. In this study, in silico approaches, that is, the knowledge based motif discovery and de novo motif discovery were used to identify the regulatory motifs of 79 Mtb TA systems. The knowledge based motif discovery approach was used to design a Perl based bio-tool Mtb-sig-miner available at (https://github.com/zoozeal/Mtb-sig-miner), which could successfully detect sigma (sigma) factor specific regulatory motifs in the promoter region of Mtb TA modules. The manual curation of Mtb-sigminer output hits revealed that the majority of them possessed sigma(B) regulatory motif in their promoter region. On the other hand, de novo approach resulted in the identification of a novel conserved motif [(T/A)(G/T)NTA(G/C) (C/A)AT(C/A)] within the promoter region of 14 Mtb TA systems. The identified conserved motif was also validated for its activity as conserved core region of operator sequence of corresponding TA system by molecular docking studies. The strong binding of respective antitoxin/toxin with the identified novel conserved motif reflected the validation of identified motif as the core region of operator sequence of respective TA systems. These findings provide computational insight to understand the transcriptional regulation of Mtb TA systems.

AB Congenital heart defects (CHD) are seen in around 40% of the Down syndrome patients. Atrioventricular Septal Defect (AVSD) or endocardial cushion defect is commonest form of CHD in these children. CRELD1 gene is implicated in causation of sporadic AVSD. In the present study, we evaluated the association and significance of CRELDI variants with AVSD in Down syndrome (DS) patients. Sequencing was done in blood samples from 3 groups: group I (DS with AVSD), group II (DS without AVSD) and group III (non-syndromic AVSD cases). Twenty two variants in CRELD1 gene were identified, comprising of sixteen novel and six previously reported variants. However, on the basis of sequence, as well as structure analysis, the variant c.973G > A(p.G1u325Lys) variant was identified only in DS having AVSD group which was predicted to have significant effects on calcium binding of putative CRELD1 protein.
   Since CRELD1 gene acts as a regulator of calcineurin/NFATc1 signaling which is crucial for the regulation of cardiac development by dephosphorylation of the transcription factor, NFAT(nuclear factor of activated T cells),in cytoplasm, the variation in cb-EGF-like calcium binding domain in CRELDI protein is likely to have pathogenic consequences. Thus, we conclude that the CRELD1 gene is likely to have a major role in causation of AVSD phenotype in selected DS patients.

AB Maturity onset diabetes is a genetic form of diabetes mellitus characterized by an early age at onset and several etiologic genes for this form of diabetes have been identified in many patients. Maturity onset diabetes type 2 [MODY2 (#125851)] caused by mutations in the glucokinase gene (GCK). Although its prevalence is not clear, it is estimated that 1%-2% of patients with diabetes have the monogenic form. The aim of this study was to evaluate the molecular spectrum of GCK gene mutations in 177 Turkish MODY type 2 patients. Mutations in the GCK gene were identified in 79 out of 177. All mutant alleles were identified, including 45 different GCK mutations, 20 of which were novel.

AB Secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (SFRP5) is a newly identified adipokine. SFRP5 expression increases during the differentiation and maturation of adipocytes, but the factors regulating SFRP5 expression during this process remain unclear. This study showed that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) adenovirus transfection could enhance the SFRP5 expression of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Three potential binding sites of PPAR gamma in the SFRP5 promoter domain were found by bioinformatics analysis. Luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated that PPAR gamma regulated the activity of the SFRP5 promoter through cis-acting elements at -2,284- -1,500 bp. Further experiments verified that PPAR gamma could specifically bind to the SFRP5 promoter at -2,284- -2,263 bp using chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. These results suggest that SFRP5 be a target gene of PPAR gamma, and its expression may be under the transcriptional regulation of PPAR gamma.

AB Background: Genetic variations of Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) and CXC-chemokine receptor typel (CXCR1), the key elements of innate immune system and their association with urinary tract infection (UTI) were studied in general population. In present study we investigate genetic variation of these genes in diabetic patients (3 to 4 times higher prevalence of UTI in comparison to general population).
   Methods: A total 1100 subjects (318 diabetic patients with UTI, 324 diabetic patients without UTI, 200 non diabetic UTI patients and 260 age matched healthy control) were enrolled in the study. SNPs of TLR4 rs4986790, rs4986791 and CXCR1 rs2234671 was assessed by PCR-RFLP and PCR-SSP respectively.
   Results: Statistical analysis revealed that A/G genotype and G allele of TLR4 rs4986790 are significantly associated with UTI in both diabetics and nondiabetic patients in comparison to healthy control. Similarly CT genotype and T allele of TLR4 rs4986791 are also significantly associated with UTI in both groups. We also found that prevalence of A/G genotype of TLR4 rs4986790 and CT genotype of TLR4 rs4986791 are significantly higher in patients of diabetes with UTI in comparison to diabetic patients without UTI. We did not find any association of CXCR1 rs2234671 polymorphism with UTI by comparing with any group.
   Conclusion: We found that TLR4 rs4986790 and rs4986791 gene polymorphism is a risk for UTI development in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients in north Indian population.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the effects of negative and positive energy balances on gene expression of regulators and enzymes controlling lipogenesis and lipolysis in muscle and adipose depots of fat-tailed and thin tailed lambs. Lambs were slaughtered during neutral, negative and positive energy balances for sample collection. Real time q-PCR was conducted to measure the gene expression. Expression of PPAR gamma was increased in response to positive energy balance regardless of genotype and type of tissue (P < 0.04). Expression of SREBF1 was reduced in response to negative and positive energy balances in fat-tailed lambs, whereas in thin-tailed lambs, downregulated SREBF1 was restored during positive energy balance (P < 0.01). Enhancement in FABP4 expression in response to negative and positive energy balances was respectively higher in thin-tailed and fat tailed lambs affected by interaction of genotype and energy balance (P < 0.11). In thin-tailed lambs, the enhanced FABP4 expression in response to negative energy balance was considerably higher in mesenteric adipose depot, whereas in fat-tailed lambs, positive energy balance induced enhancement in FABP4 expression was considerably higher in fat-tail adipose depot. The results demonstrate that transcription regulation of lipogenesis and lipolysis during negative and positive energy balances occurs differently in fat-tailed and thin-tailed lambs. Thin-tailed and fat-tailed lambs are respectively more responsive to negative and positive energy balances and mesenteric and fat-tail adipose depots respectively in thin-tailed and fat-tailed lambs are the main adipose depots responsible for higher responsiveness of thin-tailed and fat-tailed lambs to negative and positive energy balances.

AB Hemostatic genes polymorphisms are well known to be associated with venous thrombosis, but their association with arterial thrombosis especially myocardial infarction (MI) remains to be clarified. We investigated the role of three hemostatic gene polymorphisms, prothrombin G20210A, factor XIII (FXIII) Va134Leu (G/T), and fibrinogen-beta-455G/A and their coexistence in Egyptian patients with MI. The possible correlation of these polymorphisms with plasma fibrinogen level was also evaluated. The study included 120 patients with MI and 60 healthy volunteers. Gene polymorphisms were tested using multiplex polymerase chain reaction and reverse hybridization technique. Plasma fibrinogen level was determined by ELISA. Our study showed an increased risk of MI with fibrinogen beta-455G/A heterozygosity as well as FXIII Va134Leu homo and heterozygosity. In addition, the FXIII T allele (Leu34) and fibrinogen beta-455A allele were significantly associated with MI. Conversely, the prevalence of prothrombin mutation did not differ between patients with MI and controls. Combined carriers of FXIII Leu34 and fibrinogen-beta 455A alleles were at higher risk of MI, whereas combined FXIII Va134Leu and prothrombin 20210A polymorphisms did not show increased risk for MI compared with controls. Plasma fibrinogen levels were significantly higher in patients with MI than controls. In MI patients, plasma fibrinogen levels were significantly higher in those with FXIII GT/TT or fibrinogen beta-455 GA, while were significantly lower in those with prothrombin 20210 GA compared with patients with wild type genotypes. In conclusion, our results suggest a possible thrombotic predisposition of FXIII Va134Leu, fibrinogen beta-455G/A polymorphisms and their coexistence for MI. These polymorphisms may add complexity to disease pathology by increasing plasma fibrinogen level. Extended studies are needed to confirm our results; nevertheless, these data may be implicated in genetic counseling and screening of high-risk individuals.

AB The KCNH2 or human ether-a go-go-related gene (hERG) encodes the Kv11.1 potassium channel that conducts the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium current in the heart. The expression of Kv11.1 C-terminal isoforms is directed by the alternative splicing and polyadenylation of intron 9. Splicing of intron 9 leads to the formation of a functional, full-length Kv11.1a isoform and polyadenylation of intron 9 results in the production of a non-functional, C-terminally truncated Kv11.1a-USO isoform. The relative expression of Kv11.1a and Kv11.1a-USO plays an important role in regulating Kv11.1 channel function. In the heart, only one-third of KCNH2 pre-mRNA is processed to Kv11.1a due to the weak 5' splice site of intron 9. We previously showed that the weak 5' splice site is caused by sequence deviation from the consensus, and that mutations toward the consensus sequence increased the efficiency of intron 9 splicing. It is well established that 5' splice sites are recognized by complementary base-paring with U1 small nuclear RNA (U1 snRNA). In this study, we modified the sequence of U1 snRNA to increase its complementarity to the 5' splice site of KCNH2 intron 9 and observed a significant increase in the efficiency of intron 9 splicing. RNase protection assay and western blot analysis showed that modified U1 snRNA increased the expression of the functional Kv11.1a isoform and concomitantly decreased the expression of the non-functional Kv11.1a-USO isoform. In patch-clamp experiments, modified U1 snRNA significantly increased Kv11.1 current. Our findings suggest that relative expression of Kv11.1 C-terminal isoforms can be regulated by modified U1 snRNA.

AB Mycobacterium tuberculosis katG gene is responsible for production of an enzyme catalase peroxidase that per oxidises and activates the prodrug Isoniazid (INH), a first-line antitubercular agent. INH interacts with catalase peroxidase enzyme within its heme pocket and gets converted to an active form. Mutations occurring in katG gene are often linked to reduced conversion rates for INH. This study is focussed on one such mutation occurring at residue 279, where glycine often mutates to aspartic acid (G279D). In the present study, several structural analyses were performed to study the effect of this mutation on functionality of KatG protein. On comparison, mutant protein exhibited a lower docking score, smaller binding cavity and reduced affinity towards INH. Molecular dynamics analysis revealed the mutant to be more rigid and less compact than the native protein. Essential dynamics analysis determined correlated motions of residues within the protein structure. G279D mutant was found to have many residues that showed related motions and an undesirable effect on the functionality of protein.

AB Cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are defined as a subset of tumor cells, are able to self -renew, proliferate, differentiate similar to normal stem cells. Therefore, targeting CSCs has been considered as a new approach in cancer therapy. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase which plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, cell growth, self-renewal in CSCs.
   On the other hand, hTERT overactivation provides replicative feature and immortality to CSCs, so the stemness and replicative properties of CSCs depend on telomerase activity. Therefore hTERT/telomerase activity may become a universal biomarker for anticancer therapy and it is an attractive therapeutic target for CSCs. It is known that mTOR regulates telomerase activity at the translational and post -translational level. Researchers show that mTOR inhibitor rapamycin reduces telomerase activity without changing hTERT mRNA activity. Correlation between mTOR and hTERT is important for survival and immortality of cancer cells.
   In addition, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and hTERT up-regulation are related with cancer stemness features and drug resistance. mTOR inhibitor and TERT inhibitor combination may construct a novel strategy in cancer stem cells and it can make a double effect on telomerase enzyme. Consequently, inhibition of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway components and hTERT activation may prohibit CSC self-renewal and surpass CSC-mediated resistance in order to develop new cancer therapeutics.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNAs that are involved in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. MicroRNAs play an important role in cancer cell proliferation, survival and apoptosis. Epigenetic modifiers regulate the microRNA expression. Among the epigenetic players, histone deacetylases (HDACs) function as the key regulators of microRNA expression. Epigenetic machineries such as DNA and histone modifying enzymes and various microRNAs have been identified as the important contributors in cancer initiation and progression. Recent studies have shown that developing innovative microRNA-targeting therapies might improve the human health, specifically against the disease areas of high unmet medical need. Thus microRNA based therapeutics are gaining importance for anti-cancer therapy. Studies on Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) have revealed the early relapse and poor overall survival of patients which needs immediate therapeutic attention. In this report, we focus the effect of HDAC inhibitors on TNBC cell proliferation, regulation of microRNA gene expression by a series of HDAC genes, chromatin epigenetics, epigenetic remodelling at miR-200 promoter and its modulation by various HDACs. We also discuss the need for identifying novel HDAC inhibitors for modulation of miR-200 in triple negative breast cancer.

AB Fabry disease is an X-linked inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding alpha-galactosidase A (GLA). Once it was thought to affect only hemizygous males. Over the last fifteen years, research has shown that most females carrying mutated allele also develop symptoms, demonstrating a wide range of disease severity, from a virtually asymptomatic to more classical profile, with cardiac, renal, and cerebrovascular manifestations. This variable expression in females is thought to be influenced by the process of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). The aim of this study was to assess severity of the clinical phenotype, to analyze XCI patterns, and to estimate their effect on disease manifestation in twelve female Fabry disease patients from five unrelated Polish families. Our analyses revealed that patients presented with the broad range of disease expression - from mild to severe, and their clinical involvement did not correlate with XCI profiles. Female carriers of the mutation in the GLA gene with the random XCI may present with the wide range of disease signs and symptoms. Thus, XCI is not a main factor in the phenotype variability of Fabry disease manifestation in heterozygous females.

AB Lipid metabolism has important roles in animal growth, development, and reproduction. As a regulator of lipid metabolism, CIDEc promotes unilocular development of lipid droplets and stimulates intracellular lipid deposition, and has two isoforms, CIDEc-1 and CIDEc-s. CIDEc-I has ten more N-terminal amino acids than CIDEc-s. However, the functions of two isoforms are largely unknown. In this study, the expression profiles of two isoforms in Bama pigs differed, with cidec-1 dominant in the liver and small intestine, and cidec-s dominant in muscle and adipose tissue. Fasting and consuming a high-fat diet resulted in changes in the expression of the two isoforms that were closely related to changes in blood and muscle triglyceride (TG) concentrations. Comparison of gene expression and TG concentration suggested that CIDEc-1 accelerated lipid secretion and that CIDEc-s promoted lipid deposition, implying that the two isoforms had different functions. Study In vitro confirmed that CIDEc-s stimulated lipid deposition in C2C12 muscle cells and CIDEc-I promoted lipid secretion in HepG2 liver cells. The results showed that two tissue-specific CIDEc isoforms had different roles in lipid deposition and secretion. They may be potential targets for regulation of fat content.

AB Background Uncertainty remains on the pathogenetic mechanisms, model of inheritance as well as genotype phenotype correlation of FMF disease.
   Objective: To investigate the impact of genetic factors on the FMF phenotype and the disease inheritance model.
   Methods: A total of 107 FMF patients were enrolled. Patients were diagnosed clinically. All patients underwent genetic analysis of the FMF locus on 16p13.3.
   Results: 9 distinct mutations were detected. Specifically, the 85.98% of patients showed a heterozygous genotype. The most common genotypes were p.Met68011e/wt and p.Met694Val/wt. The most frequent clinical findings were fever, abdominal pain, joint pain, thoracic pain, and erysipelas-like erythema. Analysis of clinical data did not detect any significant difference in clinical phenotype among heterozygous, homozygous as well as compound homozygous subjects, further supporting the evidence that, contrary to the recessive autosomal inheritance, -heterozygous patients fulfilled the criteria of clinical FMF. Moreover, subjects with p.Met694Val/wt and p.Met680I1e/wt genotype reported the most severe clinical phenotype. p.A1a744Ser/wt, p.G1u148G1nMet68011e, p.Met680IIe/Met680Ile, p.Met680I1e/Met694Val, p.Pro369Ser/wt, p.Met694I1e/wt, p.G1u148GInGlu148G1n, p.Lys695Arg/wt resulted in 100% pathogenicity.
   Conclusions: The existence of a "non classic" autosomal recessive inheritance as well as of an "atypical" dominant autosomal inheritance with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity cannot be excluded in FMF.

AB Activation of pro-inflamatuar pathways play major role in formation of major complications as a result of burns. This study was planned to investigate the protective effect of Silk Fibroin in lung injury caused by burn in the experimental rat model. After rinsing the skin of rats under ether anesthesia, the exposed back region, covers 30% of the total body, was kept in the 90 degrees C water bath for 10 s. The control rats were kept in the 25 degrees C water bath for 10 s. Immediately after burning process, silk fibroin was administered orally at a dose of 600 mg/kg. After 24 h following burning from all groups the levels of TNF-alpha, IL -1 beta in blood samples and the MDA, GSH and the activity of MPO were determined from taken lung tissues. Moreover, the expression of Bcl-2/Bax, Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 were determined. Significant increase in TNF-alpha, Casp-1 beta and Casp-9 levels were observed in the Silk Fibroin-treated burn group (p < 0.05) whereas for ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, a significant reduction was observed compared to control group (p < 0.05). Increased levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 in Silk Fibroin-treated burn groups were found to be reversed. Silk fibroin can be an effective biomaterial in diminishing burn injury in tissue and apoptosis.

AB Objective: The association between mutations in the USP26 gene and male infertility has been studied intensively. However, the biological function of the mutant proteins remains to be elucidated. To confirm the effects of the reported mutations, we analyse the enzyme activity of USP26 between the wild-type and the variants from a molecular perspective.
   Methods: Using pGEX-USP26 as a template, site -directed mutagenesis was conducted to generate nineteen USP26 mutant plasmids. Using Ub-Met-beta-gal and GST-Ub52 as model substrates, a USP cleavage assay was conducted to assess the enzymatic activities of the mutants.
   Results: The enzyme activity of the Q156H mutant disappeared, but the other 18 mutants had the same activity as the wild type. E174# and E189# were terminal mutants, but they still had the same activity as the wild type. When we constructed the transcription terminal mutants E174#(1-522 bp), E174#(523-2742 bp), E189#(1-567 bp) and E189#(568-2742 bp) artificially, the enzyme activity of these four mutants disappeared.
   Conclusions: We have successfully constructed nineteen mutants of USP26. The enzyme activity of the Q156H mutant disappeared, but the enzyme activities of the other 18 mutants were the same as that of the wild type.

AB Wnt signaling plays important roles in differentiation, morphogenesis and development. This signaling pathway is highly regulated at all levels and microRNAs are small noncoding RNAs regulating Wnt signaling. Here, we intended to investigate hsa-miR-11181 (a novel miRNA located in TrkC gene) effect on Wnt signaling pathway in SW480 cell line. TOP/FOP flash assay indicated up-regulation of Wnt signaling, following the overexpression of hsa-miR-11181, verified through RT-qPCR. Bioinformatics analysis predicted APC1, APC2 and Axin1 might be targeted by hsa-miR-11181. Then, RT-qPCR analysis indicated that APC2 and Axin1 have been significantly down-regulated following the hsa-miR-11181 overexpression. However dual luciferase assay analysis supported only APC2 3'-UTR is directly targeted by this miRNA. Then, treatment of SW480 cells with Wnt-inhibitory small molecules supported the effect of hsa-miR-11181 at the inhibitory complex level containing APC2 protein. Consistently, viability of SW480 cells overexpressing hsa-miR-11181 was significantly elevated, measured through MIT assay. Overall, these results suggest that hsa-miR-11181 may play a crucial role in Wnt signaling regulation and confirmed that APC2 3'-UTR is targeted by hsa-miR-11181 and propose the presence of its recognition sites in the promoter or coding regions of Axin1 gene.

AB Chromodomain-Helicase-DNA binding protein 8 (CHD8) is a member of a large family of eukaryotic ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes. Loss of function alleles of human chd8 are correlated with autism spectrum disorder. The CHD subfamily members contain a tandem pair of chromodomains that are adjacent to a centrally located Snf2-like helicase domain. An alternatively spliced variant mRNA of CHD8 was identified years ago in mammals that encode a truncated form of the protein, called Duplin, that lacks the helicase domain and everything else in the carboxyl direction. We are using zebrafish to explore the functions of CHD8, especially the truncated form that we refer to as CHD8short (CHD8S). The mRNA for CHD8S is expressed differentially during embryonic development. Using a PCR assay we detected expression of putative zebrafish chd8s mRNA that is barely detectable during early embryogenesis (shield stage at 6 h), but increases markedly soon thereafter at 80-90% epiboly (9 h) and bud stages (10 h), with a return to low levels in 16-somite (17 h) and 24 hpf embryos. Except for high expression during the shield stage, steady-state levels of chd81 (long) mRNA are relatively constant during the same period of development. We subcloned both chd81 and chd8s cDNAs into expression vector plasmids for use in transient transfection experiments in zebrafish ZF4 cells. In some experiments the luciferase reporter gene was driven by a synthetic promoter that is responsive to activation by ZNF143 activator protein, a known interacting protein with CHD8 in mammalian cells. Whereas CHD8L was a modest coactivator, CHD8S was a potent coactivator, a surprising result since CHD8S is lacking a critical domain to function as a chromatin remodeler enzyme. CHD8S coactivator function is dependent on a region of the protein within the first 50 amino-terminal amino acids. In transient transfection experiments using a Lef1/beta-catenin reporter gene, CHD8S was a modest repressor, but deletion of 50 or more amino-terminal amino acids converted it to a coactivator. When synthetic chd8s mRNA was injected into zebrafish embryos in order to overexpress CHD8S, we observed significant brain disruption phenotypes.

AB The fruiting body of Lentinula edodes is a popular edible mushroom, and extracts from the mycelium and the fruiting body of this species have diverse therapeutic potential. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the fruiting body growth of L. edodes from the early bud stage (EBS), through the intermediate developing stage (IDS), to the fully developed stage (FDS), we performed de novo transcriptomic analysis using high-throughput Illumina RNA-sequencing. First, we generated three cDNA libraries representative of the three respective stages. We then obtained 38,933,148, 44,594,472, and 37,905,646 high-quality reads from the respective libraries and assembled the reads into 25,104 transcriptional contigs, containing 15,199 unigenes. We found that only 9331 of the unigenes had been annotated in the NCBI non-redundant protein database, and we functionally annotated 4758 of them through Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and 2921 of them through Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) analysis. We also assigned 3995 unigenes to metabolic pathways by using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). We further identified 399 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between EBS and IDS, 1428 between IDS and FDS, and 1830 between EBS and FDS, uncovering 769 DEGs in multiple metabolic and signaling pathways. Interestingly, there were a limited number of DEGs whose expression was dramatically associated with FDS. Finally, genes, whose expression was either highly up regulated in FDS or remained at a high level during fruiting body growth, were annotated specifically in the pathways of purine metabolism, unsaturated fatty acid metabolism and meiosis, suggesting that these key molecular events were actively occurring in the fruiting body. Our work is the first high-throughput transcriptome study on the growth of L. edodes fruiting bodies, and the results uncovered candidate genes for future gene identification and utilization of this commercially and medically important mushroom.

AB Objectives: Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide, and its morbidity and mortality rates continue to rise. The role of lncRNAs in lung cancer has become an emerging area of research.
   Materials and methods: The expression of CAV-1 and HOTAIR was determined in lung cancer tissues and cell lines by western blot and RT-qPCR. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion were analysed in lung cell following knockdown or overexpression of CAV-1 or HOTAIR by transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA) or plasmid.
   Results: The expression of CAV-1 and HOTAIR in lung cancer tissues and cell lines was higher than in normal lung tissue or normal lung cell lines. We discovered that CAV-1 could regulate cell proliferation, migration and invasion. At the same time, CAV-1 could regulate the expression of HOTAIR. In addition, knockdown of the expression of HOAIR partially reverses the promotion of cell viability and invasion induced by CAV-1.
   Conclusions: Our results indicated that CAV-1 coordinate the lung cancer through HOTAIR. And HOTAIR may become a novel target for lung cancer therapy.

AB Studies have highlighted the critical role of GATA6 in conotruncal heart defects (CTDs). Nevertheless, relationship between GATA6 variants and different CTDs remains largely unknown. Here GATA6 gene was screened in 542 patients with CTDs using targeted sequencing. Variant frequency was 2.0% (11/542). Three novel variants: c.86C > A (p.A29E), c.296T > A (p.V99D) and c.1254de1C (p.S418fs) were identified in patients with transposition of the great arteries, double outlet right ventricle and persistent truncus arteriosus, respectively, but in none of the 400 controls. Western blot revealed that A29E and V99D mutant protein had similar expression pattern with wild-type GATA6 protein, but S418fs mutant protein appeared as a truncated doublet. Reporter gene assay demonstrated that A29E and V99D mutant protein retained the ability to activate BNP and ANF promoter, whereas S418fs mutant protein failed to transactivate both of them, compared with wild-type. Subcellular localization of wild-type, A29E and V99D mutant protein were in the nucleus, while S418fs mutant protein was expressed both in the nucleus and cytoplasm. In conclusion, GATA6 variant frequency in sporadic CTDs patients was higher than that in other congenital heart diseases. Variant c.1254deIC was a pathogenic variant associated with CTDs, especially PTA, whereas c.86C > A and c.296T > A should be considered as likely pathogenic variants.

AB Congenital heart diseases (CHDs) affect nearly 1% of all neonates and show an increasing tendency. The complex inheritance patterns and multifactorial etiologies make these defects difficult to be identified before complete manifestation. Genetic screening has identified hundreds of specific mutant sites for CHDs based on cardiac transcriptional factors. GATA4 is a master regulator required for ventral morphogenesis and heart tube formation. Its mutation is most widely studied in CHDs. In the past decades, over 100 GATA4 mutant sites have been reported, but only a few functional sites have been identified. Thus, it is important to distinguish deleterious sites from neutral sites. In silico prediction of functional sites using bioinformatics tools can provide the valuable information, but it is not solid enough. Here, the roles of GATA4 in heart development is discussed in detail and its mutation sites in protein coding region are summarized systematically, providing an integrated resource for GATA4 mutations. Furthermore, we discussed the advantage and disadvantage of different methods for functional mutation identification. Especially, the disease model of induced pluripotent stem cell is emerging as a powerful tool to assess GATA4 mutations in human. In the recent years, single-cell based high-throughput sequencing is being applied in preimplantation diagnosis and assisted reproduction progressively, providing a new strategy for the prevention of congenital diseases as we discussed. Based on functional mutant sites identification, preimplantation diagnosis will contribute to CHDs prevention eventually.

AB Background and aims: Recent studies show that FTO single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). On the other hand, many animal models and clinical studies have demonstrated that apelin, an adipocytokine, is related to the obesity and T2DM. Additionally, obese women are at risk of Hyperandrogenemia. So, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between FTO variants (rs763967273, rs759031579, rs141115189, rs9926289, rs76804286 and rs9939609) with T2DM, serum apelin and androgenic hormones in Iranian obese women.
   Subjects and methods: 197 obese women (123 women with T2DM and 74 women as healthy control) were participated in this study. Anthropometrical and biochemical characteristics were measured. Serum apelin and androgen hormones levels were determined in 66 subjects consisting of 33 cases and 33 controls. PCR were carried out and subsequently, the PCR production was genotyped by Sanger sequencing assay.
   Results: Our observations showed that all SNPs are related to T2DM. The rs9926289 FTO variant had a strong association with serum apelin and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate levels (P = 0.04 and P = 0.03, respectively) among SNPs. In addition, apelin and androgenic hormones were correlated with T2DM. Two polymorphisms including rs9939609 and rs9926289 had a strong Linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 1).
   Conclusion: FTO variants not only were associated with T2DM, but also some variants had a strong association with apelin and androgenic hormones profile.

AB Background: Since 2013/2014, the WHO has been recommending quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIV) to prevent seasonal influenza. In 2015, Japan replaced trivalent influenza vaccines (TIV) by QIV. We used computer simulations to calculate how this impacted the epidemiology and to assess its cost-effectiveness.
   Methods: We simulated the seasonal transmission of the four influenza strains A(H1N1), A(H3N2), B/Yamagata and B/Victoria with the individual-based simulation tool 4Flu, using official demographic data and Japanese contact patterns. The model considered maternal protection, immunity boosting, new drift variants and different immunity durations for naturally acquired and vaccination-derived immunity. Starting with the 2015/16 season, simulations were evaluated for 20 years, using either TIV or QIV with the reported vaccination coverage. Costs and years of life saved (YOLSs) were calculated and discounted at 2%, using 2015 as base year.
   Results: QIV annually prevents on average 548 influenza cases (4.7% of cases which occur when using TIV; 11.9% of influenza B), 1.62 hospitalizations and 0.078 deaths per 100,000 individuals. In Japan's population of 125.35 million, annually 91.51 YOLSs are gained by QIV and 10.75 million USD are saved (societal perspective). From payer perspective, the ICER is 3698 USD/VOLS.
   Conclusions: QIV is cost-effective (payer perspective) or even cost-saving (societal perspective) in Japan. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: The SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy developed a vaccine hesitancy measure, the Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (VHS). This scale has the potential to aid in the advancement of research and immunization policy but has not yet been psychometrically evaluated.
   Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, we collected self-reported survey data from a large national sample of Canadian parents from August to September 2016. An online questionnaire was completed in English or French. We used exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to identify latent constructs underlying parents' responses to 10 VHS items (response scale 1-5, with higher scores indicating greater hesitancy). In addition to the VHS, measures included socio-demographics items, vaccine attitudes, parents' human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine decision-making stage, and vaccine refusal.
   Results: A total of 3779 Canadian parents completed the survey in English (74.1%) or French (25.9%). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure best explained the data, consisting of 'lack of confidence' (M = 1.98, SD = 0.72) and 'risks' (M = 3.07, SD = 0.95). Significant Pearson correlations were found between the scales and related vaccine attitudes. ANOVA analyses found significant differences in the VHS sub-scales by parents' vaccine decision-making stages (p < .001). Independent samples t-tests found that the VHS sub-scales were associated with HPV vaccine refusal and refusing another vaccine (p < .001). Socio-demographic differences in the VHS were found; however, effect sizes were small (eta(2) < 0.02).
   Conclusions: The VHS was found to have two factors that have construct and criterion validity in identifying vaccine hesitant parents. A limitation of the VHS was few items that loaded on the 'risks' component and a lack of positively and negatively worded items for both components. Based on these results, we suggest modifying the wording of some items and adding items on risk perceptions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Hepatitis B virus infection remains an important public health problem in the United States. Currently approved alum-adjuvanted vaccines require three doses and have reduced immunogenicity in adults, particularly in those who have diabetes mellitus, or are older, male, obese, or who smoke.
   Methods: Phase 3 observer blinded, randomized (2:1 HBsAg-1018 [HEPLISAV-B (TM)]:HBsAg-Eng [Engerix-B (R)), active controlled trial in adults 18-70 years of age. HBsAg-1018 was administered intramuscularly at weeks 0 and 4 and placebo at week 24 and HBsAg-Eng at weeks 0, 4, and 24. The primary immunogenicity endpoint assessed the noninferiority of the seroprotection rate at week 28 in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Secondary endpoints included seroprotection rates in the total trial population and by age, sex, body mass index, and smoking status.
   Results: Among 8374 participants randomized, 961 participants in the per-protocol population had type 2 diabetes mellitus. In diabetes participants, the seroprotection rate in the HBsAg-1018 group at week 28 was 90.0%, compared with 65.1% in the HBsAg-Eng group, with a difference of 24.9% (95% CI: 19.3%, 30.7%), which met the prospectively-defined criteria for noninferiority and statistical significance. In the total study per-protocol population (N = 6826) and each pre-specified subpopulation, the seroprotection rate in the HBsAg-1018 group was statistically significantly higher than in the HBsAg-Eng group.
   Conclusion: Two doses of HBsAg-1018, administered over 4 weeks, induced significantly higher seroprotection rates than three doses of HBsAg-Eng, given over 24 weeks, in adults with factors known to reduce the immune response to hepatitis B vaccines as well as in those without those factors. With fewer doses in a shorter time, and greater immunogenicity, HBsAg-1018 has the potential to significantly improve protection against hepatitis B in adults at risk for hepatitis B infection.

AB A live attenuated African swine fever virus (ASFV) vaccine candidate, produced by deletion of several genes belonging to multi-gene families MGF360 and 505 from virulent Benin 97/1 strain (Benin Delta MFG), induces protection in pigs against parental virulent strain. In order to better define the safety and efficacy of this attenuated vaccine candidate and to understand protective mechanisms, we extended previous studies by intramuscular immunisation of pigs with the deletion mutant Benin Delta MFG at different doses (10(2), 10(3), 10(4) TCID50), together with intranasal immunisation at the 103 dose. Results demonstrated a strong correlation between both doses and routes of immunisation of Benin Delta MFG and the percentage of protection achieved, the onset of clinical signs, the viremia levels reached and the onset of death in non-protected pigs. The results show that the intramuscular route using high doses (10(4) TCID50) is the best option for immunisation. Only transient increase in temperature associated with a peak of virus genome levels was observed in most pigs after immunisation. Then, virus genome levels progressively decreased throughout the experiment until reaching low or undetectable levels in those protected pigs that survived after challenge. The IgM antibody responses following immunisation were detected between day 7-10 post-immunisation and remained at elevated levels for 10-18 days in most pigs before dropping. IgG was detected from day 15 to 21 post-immunisation and maintained at increased levels for the remainder of the experiment in most pigs. Induction of IFN gamma and IL-10 was detected by ELISA in sera from some pigs immunised with 10(3) TCID50 by intramuscular or intranasal route at early times post-immunisation. IL-10 was also detected in serum from some non-protected pigs included in these groups after challenge. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) has been successfully used as live vaccine against Marek's disease (MD) worldwide for more than 40 years either alone or in combination with other serotypes. HVT is also widely used as a vector platform for generation of recombinant vaccines against a number of avian diseases such as infectious bursal disease (IBD), Newcastle disease (ND) and avian influenza (AI) using conventional recombination methods or recombineering tools on cloned viral genomes. In the present study, we describe the application of CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing as a rapid and efficient method of generating HVT recombinants expressing VP2 protein of IBDV. This approach offers an efficient method to introduce other viral antigens into the HVT genome for rapid development of recombinant vaccines. (C) 2018 The Pirbright Institute.

AB Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a highly contagious disease that results in enormous economic losses in the global poultry sector. Lactic acid bacteria are an appealing vehicle for the safe and effective delivery of heterologous protein antigens. Oral administration of the commensal bacterium Lactococcus lactis expressing recombinant fusion proteins has been used to elicit mucosal and systemic immune responses. In this study, a Lactococcus lactis NZ3900 strain co-expressing the outer membrane protein (Omp) H of the microfold (M) cell-targeting ligand and the viral capsid protein (VP)2 antigen of IBDV was genetically engineered, and its immunopotentiating capacity as an oral and injected vaccine in chickens was evaluated. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that VP2-OmpH was expressed in the cytoplasm of cells and had high immunoreactivity. An in vivo study showed that in the absence of any adjuvant, the recombinant L lactis VP2-OmpH strain stimulated the immune response and protected against very virulent IBDV challenge in 100% and 80% of chickens immunized by injection and oral administration, respectively. Moreover, the antiviral neutralizing antibody titers induced by injection administration were higher than those induced by oral administration. Mucosal secretory IgA titers induced by oral administration were higher than those induced by injection administration. These results suggested that the recombinant L. lactis VP2-OmpH strain is a promising candidate vaccine to prevent IBDV infection. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Concerns about a potential link between sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and vaccination are unsupported by longitudinal evidence. The analyses employed a multivariate mixed-effects model analyzing data from the National Immunization Survey, School Vaccination Assessment Reports, National Vital Statistics and National Children's Health Survey. We found that state-level childhood vaccine uptake for age appropriate vaccines was neither associated with the decline in the incidence of SIDS nor rise in the prevalence of ADHD.

AB Background: Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) is an important pathogen in causing global morbidity and mortality among children. This study aimed to determine phenotypic and molecular characteristics of S. pneumoniae causing infections in children under five years in China.
   Methods: A hospital-based retrospective study was conducted. All 537 S. pneumoniae isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by E-test method, molecular characteristics including resistance genes, virulence genes and serotypes by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, and sequence types (STs) by sequencing seven housekeeping genes. Minimum spanning tree and correspondence analysis were used to reveal the potential relationship between serotypes and STs.
   Results: Most of S. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to erythromycin (93.9%) and tetracycline (86.4%), with the predominant resistance genes being erm(B) (92.6%) and tet(M) (95.5%). The prevalent serotypes were 19F, 6B, 19A, 23F and 14, the coverage rate of PCV13 was high in 85.8%, and the predominant STs were ST271, ST320, ST3173, ST81 and ST876. A significant correlation existed between STs and serotypes, with ST271/19F and ST320/19A as the most prevalent clones. Notably, ST271/19F and ST320/19A isolates were associated with resistance to specific antibiotics and carrying of mef(A/E), rlrA and sipA genes.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest the introduction of PCV13 vaccine to Chinese children, and underscore the value of monitoring multiple characteristics to detect new epidemiologic trends and provide implications for the formulation of multivalent pneumococcal vaccines.

AB Introduction: In older adults, prior administration of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) blunts the opsonophagocytic antibody (OPA) response to subsequent administration of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). To determine whether a higher dose of PCV13 could mitigate this effect in adults 55 through 74 years of age, we compared OPA responses to a double dose of PCV13 in persons previously vaccinated with PPSV23 with responses to a single dose of PCV13 in previously vaccinated persons, and with a single dose in PPSV23 naive persons.
   Methods: Subjects previously vaccinated with PPSV23 were randomly assigned to receive either a single injection or two concurrent injections of 0.5 mL PCV13. Naive subjects received a single injection of 0.5 mL PCV13. Serotype-specific OPA responses to 12 of the PCV13 serotypes were assessed on samples collected on Day 29 and Day 181. Comparisons of the OPA titers between study groups were based on the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the log geometric mean ratio to define superiority (>1) and non-inferiority (>0.5).
   Results: At Day 29, the OPA responses to one dose in previously vaccinated (n = 284) versus one dose in naive subjects (n = 311) achieved the threshold for non-inferiority for only 3 of the 12 serotypes. In previously vaccinated subjects, responses to a double dose (n = 288) versus a single dose met the threshold for superiority for 7 serotypes. The responses to a double dose in previously vaccinated subjects versus a single dose in naive subjects met the threshold for non-inferiority for 9 serotypes.
   Conclusions: There is a dose response to PCV13 in older adults and the higher response to a double dose in previously vaccinated adults is non-inferior to that of a single dose in naive adults for 9 of the 12 PCV13 serotypes evaluated. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Infectious bursal disease (IBD) remains a major threat to the poultry industry. Recombinant herpesvirus of turkey (rHVT)-IBD vaccines have been successfully used to induce a protective immune response against IBD. However, the capacity for rHVT-IBD vaccines to induce early protection without detectable antibodies, and the underlying mechanisms mediating specific cell-mediated responses in the early stages following vaccination, have been poorly investigated. Therefore, in this study, specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens were vaccinated with rHVT-IBD and T-cell subsets were analyzed. Both splenic and circulating CD8(+) cell populations increased at 7 days postvaccination (dpv). Next, the expression of adaptive immunity-related genes was analyzed in the spleen and lung of rHVT-IBD-vaccinated chickens. Upregulation of CD8 expression was observed at 7 dpv. Interestingly, a parallel increase in the transcription of granzymes A and K was also detected from 7 dpv. To our knowledge, the latter result is the first to be reported, and it suggests that cytotoxic activity of CD8(+) T lymphocytes is activated. In contrast, expression of the innate genes examined remained largely unchanged following vaccination. To further investigate the IBD virus (IBDV)-specific responses triggered by rHVT-IBD vaccination, vaccinated chickens were inoculated with an attenuated IBDV strain with the aim of restimulating induced immune responses in vivo. The expression profiles of various genes associated with adaptive immune responses were subsequently analyzed in lung, spleen, and bursa of Fabricius samples. Significant upregulation of CD4, CD8, perforin, and IFN gamma expression were observed in the bursa samples 7 days postinoculation (dpi). In the lung, transcript levels of CD8, granzymes and perforin were also significantly higher in the rHVT-IBD-vaccinated chickens at 7 dpi, thereby suggesting that specific cellular immune responses were activated. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that stimulation of specific CD8(+) cell-mediated immunity contributes to the response against IBDV in rHVT-IBD-vaccinated chickens.

AB Background: A non-inferiority multi-centre parallel randomized double-blind trial was implemented in Zahedan district, Sistan-va-Baluchestan province, Iran, to compare the performance of the two measles vaccines which are in use in the National Immunization Programme of Iran and are of two different measles virus vaccine strains: Edmonston-Zagreb (EZ) strain vs. AIK-C strain. The main outcome measure was appearance of anti-measles antibody in sera.
   Methods: 200 infants, 8-12 months old, whose parents consented for their children to be included in the study, were randomized in permutation blocks of size 4-8 in four Urban Health Clinics. Having given a pre-vaccination blood sample, they received measles-rubella vaccine containing one of the vaccine strains mentioned before. After 60 days, the second blood sample was taken. The sera of the pre- and post-vaccination blood samples were tested for anti-measles antibodies in the National Reference Measles Laboratory. Parents, laboratory technicians and statistician were blind to groupings.
   Results: Of the 200 children equally randomized in the two arms, 185 who were seronegative before vaccination (88 in the EZ arm and 97 in the AIK-C arm) were entered in the final analysis. The seroconversion rate in the EZ arm was 76.1% (95% CI: 60.2-85.2%), and that in the AIK-C arm was 58.7%; (95% CI: 48.8-68.7%). The absolute rate difference was 17. 4% (4.1-30.9%; P-value:.012), and the relative seroconversion rate of EZ to AIK-C was 1.3 (95% CI: 1.1-1.6; P-value:.012). No adverse events were reported during the study period.
   Conclusion: A considerable difference in the seropositivity of different measles containing vaccines could be demonstrated in the first year of life. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Protection against diseases caused by the avian viruses, Marek's disease, Infectious laryngotracheitis, chicken anemia and turkey meningoencephalitis is achieved by live vaccines. The application quality is important to assure proper uptake in commercial flocks. We describe a novel evaluation method for the vaccination process by sequential monitoring the vaccine viruses in feathers. Feather collection is easy, non-invasive and non-lethal for the birds, therefore advantageous for monitoring purposes. To demonstrate the vaccine virus presence, an innovative assay of nested real-time amplification was approached because vaccine viruses presence in vivo is less abundant comparing to virulent wild-type isolates.
   The Marek's disease virus vaccine virus, Rispens/CVI988, in feathers of commercial flock was detected from 4 to 7 days and for at least 3 months post-vaccination, until the survey stopped. As the drinking water route was newly adopted for Infectious laryngotracheitis vaccination, one or two vaccine doses/bird were administered. The virus uptake was detected in feathers between 2 and 20 days-post-vaccination. With a doubled vaccine dose the positivity bird rate was higher. For the first time the chicken anemia vaccine virus presence in chicken feathers was demonstrated between 14 and 35 days-post-vaccina tion. No previous studies were available, thus in parallel to feathers the vaccine virus was demonstrated in the livers and spleens. The turkey meningoencephalitis vaccine virus uptake in turkey feather-pulps is even more innovative because this is the first turkey virus amplified from feather-pulps. The vaccine virus presence resemble the kinetics of the other 3 viruses, 3-21 days-post-vaccination. Detecting the specific antibodies following vaccination possessed a lower sensitivity than vaccine virus demonstration in feathers. In summary, the presented assay can be adopted for the quality evaluation of the vaccination process in poultry. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Neisseria meningitidis factor H binding protein (FHbp) is an important virulence factor and vaccine antigen contained in both USA licensed serogroup B meningococcal vaccines. Recent studies in human factor H (hFH) transgenic mice suggest that hFH-FHbp interactions lower FHbp-elicited immunogenicity. To provide tools with which to characterize and potentially improve FHbp immunogenicity, we developed an FHbp-cholera holotoxin-like chimera vaccine expression system in Escherichia coli that utilizes cholera toxin B (CTB) as both a scaffold and adjuvant for FHbp. We developed FHbp CTB chimeras using a wild-type (WT) FHbp and a low hFH-binding FHbp mutant R41S. Both chimeras bound to G(M1) ganglioside and were recognized by the FHbp-specific monoclonal antibody JAR4. The R41S mutant had greatly reduced hFH binding compared to the WT FHbp-CTB chimera. WT and R41S FHbp-CTB chimeric antigens were compared to equimolar amounts of FHbp admixed with CTB or FHbp alone in mouse immunogenicity studies. The chimeras were significantly more immunogenic than FHbp alone or mixed with CTB, and elicited bactericidal antibodies against a panel of MenB isolates. This study demonstrates a unique and simple method for studying FHbp immunogenicity. The chimeric approach may facilitate studies of other protein-based antigens targeting pathogenic Neisseria and lay groundwork for the development of new protein based vaccines against meningococcal and gonococcal disease.

AB Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is increasingly associated with severe acute respiratory infection and acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) in children around the world. However, neither vaccines nor therapeutic drugs are available for EV-D68. Here we report the development of a virus-like particle (VLP) based experimental EV-D68 vaccine. We found that EV-D68 VLPs could be successfully generated in insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus co-expressing the P1 precursor and 3CD protease of EV-D68. Biochemical and electron microscopic analyses revealed that EV-D68 VLPs were composed of VPO, VP1, and VP3 capsid proteins derived from precursor P1 and were visualized as spherical particles of similar to 30 nm in diameter. Immunization of mice with EV-D68 VLPs resulted in the production of serum antibodies that displayed potent serotype-specific neutralizing activities against EV-D68 virus in vitro. Passive transfer of anti-VLP sera completely protected neonatal recipient mice from lethal EV-D68 infection. Moreover, maternal immunization with these VLPs provided full protection against lethal EV-D68 challenge in suckling mice. Together, these results demonstrate that the recombinant EV-D68 VLP is a promising vaccine candidate against EV-D68 infection. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Transmissible vaccines have the potential to revolutionize infectious disease control by reducing the vaccination effort required to protect a population against a disease. Recent efforts to develop transmissible vaccines focus on recombinant transmissible vaccine designs (RTVs) because they pose reduced risk if intra-host evolution causes the vaccine to revert to its vector form. However, the shared antigenicity of the vaccine and vector may confer vaccine-immunity to hosts infected with the vector, thwarting the ability of the vaccine to spread through the population. We build a mathematical model to test whether a RTV can facilitate disease management in instances where reversion is likely to introduce the vector into the population or when the vector organism is already established in the host population, and the vector and vaccine share perfect cross-immunity. Our results show that a RTV can autonomously eradicate a pathogen, or protect a population from pathogen invasion, when cross-immunity between vaccine and vector is absent. If cross-immunity between vaccine and vector exists, however, our results show that a RTV can substantially reduce the vaccination effort necessary to control or eradicate a pathogen only when continuously augmented with direct manual vaccination. These results demonstrate that estimating the extent of cross-immunity between vector and vaccine is a critical step in RTV design, and that herpesvirus vectors showing facile reinfection and weak cross-immunity are promising.

AB Lassa virus (LASV) is the most prevalent rodent-borne arenavirus circulated in West Africa. With population at risk from Senegal to Nigeria, LASV causes Lassa fever and is responsible for thousands of deaths annually. High genetic diversity of LASV is one of the challenges for vaccine R&D. We developed multivalent virus-like particle vectors (VLPVs) derived from the human Venezuelan equine encephalitis TC-83 IND vaccine (VEEV) as the next generation of alphavirus-based bicistronic RNA replicon particles. The genes encoding VEEV structural proteins were replaced with LASV glycoproteins (GPC) from distantly related clades I and IV with individual 26S promoters. Bicistronic RNA replicons encoding wild-type LASV GPC (GPCwt) and C-terminally deleted, non-cleavable modified glycoprotein (Delta GPfib), were encapsidated into VLPV particles using VEEV capsid and glycoproteins provided in trans. In transduced cells, VLPVs induced simultaneous expression of LASV GPCwt and Delta GPfib from 26S alphavirus promoters. LASV Delta GPfib was predominantly expressed as trimers, accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum, induced ER stress and apoptosis promoting antigen cross-priming. VLPV vaccines were immunogenic and protective in mice and upregulated CD11c(+)/CD8(+) dendritic cells playing the major role in cross-presentation. Notably, VLPV vaccination resulted in induction of cross-reactive multifunctional T cell responses after stimulation of immune splenocytes with peptide cocktails derived from LASV from clades I-IV. Multivalent RNA replicon-based LASV vaccines can be applicable for first responders, international travelers visiting endemic areas, military and lab personnel. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB Background: The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was introduced in 2001. Widespread PCV use nearly eradicated pneumococcal colonization by vaccine serotypes. Since 2008, however, colonization by PCV-serotype 19F has increased in Alaska residents. We describe the epidemiology of re-emerging serotype 19F colonization.
   Methods: We conducted annual cross-sectional colonization surveys from 2008 to 2013. We recruited children aged <5 years at 2 urban clinics and participants of all ages from Region-A (2 villages), Region-B (4 villages), and Region-C (2 villages). We interviewed participants and reviewed their medical records to obtain demographic information and determine PCV status. We obtained nasopharyngeal swab specimens from participants to identify pneumococci and to determine the pneumococcal serotype, antimicrobial resistance, and multilocus sequence type. We used the Cochran-Armitage test to assess for significant trends in colonization across time periods.
   Results: Among participants aged <5 years, pneumococcal serotype 19F colonization remained unchanged from 2008-2009 (0.7%) to 2012-2013 (0.5%; P-value [P] =.54). Serotype 19F colonization increased from 2008-2009 to 2012-2013 among participants aged 5-11 years (0.3% to 3.2%; P<.01), participants 12-17 years (0.0% to 2.0%; P<.01), and participants aged >= 18 years (0.1% to 0.5%; P<.01). During 2012-2013, 85 (93%) of 91 pneumococcal serotype 19F isolates were identified among participants from Region B; the majority of serotype 19F isolates belonged to an antimicrobial nonsusceptibility pattern corresponding to a novel multilocus sequence type 9074.
   Conclusions: PCV continues to protect against serotype 19F colonization in vaccinated children aged <5 years.

AB Background: To support vaccination programs in developing countries, a 4-dose vial presentation of pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D-conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) was developed. This study assessed immunologic non-inferiority and safety of the investigational PHiD-CV 4 dose versus licensed 1-dose vial presentation in infants.
   Methods: In this phase III, mono-center, observer-blind study in Bangladesh, 6-10-week-old infants were randomized 1:1 to receive PHiD-CV primary vaccination (at ages 6, 10, 18 weeks) and a booster dose (at age 9 months) with a 4-dose vial (with preservative, 4DV group) or 1-dose vial (preservative-free, I DV group). DTPw-HBV/Hib was (co)-administered per study protocol and polio, measles and rubella vaccines as part of the national immunization program. Non-inferiority of PHiD-CV 4-dose versus 1-dose vial for each vaccine pneumococcal serotype (VT) and vaccine-related serotype 19A in terms of antibody geometric mean concentration (GMC) was assessed (criterion: upper limit of 2-sided 95% confidence interval of antibody GMC ratios [1DV/4DV] <2-fold). Immune responses were measured. Solicited, unsolicited and serious adverse events (AEs) were evaluated.
   Results: Of 320 infants (160 per group) vaccinated during the primary vaccination phase, 297 received a booster. Non-inferiority was demonstrated for each VT and 19A. One month post-primary vaccination, for most VT, >= 97.9% of infants in each group had antibody concentrations >= 0.2 mu g/mL; for 19A >= 80.1% reached this threshold. Pneumococcal antibody responses and opsonophagocytic activity for each VT and 19A were within similar ranges between groups after primary and booster vaccination, as were anti-protein D responses. Booster immune responses were observed in both groups. Reported AEs were within similar ranges for both presentations.
   Conclusion: Immunologic non-inferiority of PHiD-CV 4-dose vial (with preservative) versus PHiD-CV 1-dose vial (preservative-free) was demonstrated. Immune responses and reactogenicity following primary/booster vaccination were within similar ranges for both presentations. PHiD-CV 4-dose vial would help improve access and coverage in resource-limited countries. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB As one of the most challenging problems in swine industry, piglet diarrhea has caused huge economic loss globally. Currently, vaccination is the most effective way of controlling enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) diarrhea. However, existing commercial vaccines could not provide broad protection against different types of ETEC. In this study, we mixed a enterotoxin fusion protein SLS (STa-LTB-STb) with the main fimbrial F4ac and F5 antigens as a novel multivalent vaccine candidate. Then an overall evaluation of this vaccine candidate against ETEC was carried out in a pig model. We found that the IgG titers in serum as well as colostrum in all the vaccinated sows were significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). By using a sensory evaluation method, we demonstrated that piglets in the vaccinated group exhibited significantly healthier status than the unimmunized group. Moreover, in response to F41 + ETEC challenge, none of the piglets with the vaccine candidate experienced diarrhea, whereas 30% of the piglets suffered without vaccination. In conclusion, these results showed that the candidate vaccine could elicit multiple high-titer antibodies against all the main virulence factors and provide a broad and effective protection against ETEC diarrhea.

AB Objective: To assess the intention to accept a pertussis cocooning vaccination and to examine the determinants that influence this intention among healthcare workers (HCWs) in maternity and paediatric care.
   Design: Cross-sectional survey.
   Setting: Maternity assistants, midwives, and paediatric nurses in the Netherlands.
   Methods: We developed a 123-item questionnaire based on a literature review and the Reasoned Action Approach (a social cognitive model of behaviour). We used the questionnaire to explore the determinants of intention to accept pertussis cocooning vaccination among the HCW groups. We also assessed the behavioural beliefs underlying HCWs' attitudes towards pertussis cocooning. We used correlation and regression analyses to assess univariate and multivariate associations in the study variables.
   Results: Altogether, 486 maternity assistants, 320 midwives, and 200 paediatric nurses completed the questionnaire; 45%-63% reported their intentions to accept pertussis vaccination. Attitude, anticipated affect regarding non-acceptance, and decisional uncertainty were uniquely associated with the intention to accept a pertussis vaccination. The respondents' attitude towards pertussis cocooning vaccination was further explained by their general vaccination beliefs, agreement with a policy advice to vaccinate HCWs, the perceived cost-benefit ratio, and the perceived personal responsibility to prevent pertussis in patients.
   Conclusion: About half of the participating HCWs reported their intentions to accept a pertussis cocooning vaccination. Attitude, anticipated affect regarding non-acceptance, and decisional uncertainty came forward as the most important determinants of intention. This study helps build the evidence base describing the determinants of the intention to accept a pertussis cocooning vaccination among HCWs. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fowl adenovirus (FAdV) is comprised of five species (A to E) and 12 serotypes (1-7, 8a, 8b, 9-11). Inclusion body hepatitis (IBH) is caused by FAdV-7, 8a, 8b (species E) and FAdV-2 and 11 (species D). Commercial vaccines against IBH are not available in Canada. Autogenous FAdV broiler breeder vaccines are now used in some areas where outbreaks of IBH are occurring. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a bivalent (species D and E) live and an inactivated FAdV broiler breeder vaccine in protecting broiler chicks against IBH through maternal antibody (MtAb) transfer. FAdV seronegative broiler breeders (n = 300/group) received either a live or inactivated bivalent (FAdV-8b-SK + FAdV-11-1047) vaccine. The live vaccine (1 x 10(4) TCID50 of each virus/bird) was given orally once at 16 weeks of age and the inactivated vaccine (1 x 10(6) TCID50, of each virus + 20% Emulsigen D) was given intramuscularly at 16 and 19 weeks of age. Controls (n = 150) were given saline orally. The inactivated vaccine group was boosted 3 weeks later with the same vaccine. Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) in sera (n =10) were detected at 19, 22, 30 and 48 weeks of age. NAb were able to neutralize various FAdV serotypes within species D and E. Mean NAb were similar in the both live and killed vaccine groups at 19, 30 and 48 weeks and ranged from 2.4 to 3.7 log(10). Approximately 26 +/- 7% of MtAbs were passively transferred through eggs to day-old chicks. Progeny challenged with a lethal dose (1 x 107 TCID50/bird intramuscularly) of FAdV-8b-SK, FAdV-11-1047, or FAdV-2-685 (n = 90/group) at 14 days post-hatch (dph) showed 98-100% protection in broiler chicks to homologous or heterologous FAdV challenges. Our data suggests that a bivalent live and an inactivated FAdV vaccine are equally effective and have the potential for the control of IBH. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Estimates of vaccine effectiveness (VE) from test-negative studies may be subject to selection bias. In the context of influenza VE, we used simulations to identify situations in which meaningful selection bias can occur. We also analyzed observational study data for evidence of selection bias.
   Methods: For the simulation study, we defined a hypothetical population whose members are at risk for acute respiratory illness (ARI) due to influenza and other pathogens. An unmeasured "healthcare seeking proclivity" affects both probability of vaccination and probability of seeking care for an ARI. We varied the direction and magnitude of these effects and identified situations where meaningful bias occurred. For the observational study, we reanalyzed data from the United States Influenza VE Network, an ongoing test-negative study. We compared "bias-naive" VE estimates to bias-adjusted estimates, which used data from the source populations to correct for sampling bias.
   Results: In the simulation study, an unmeasured care-seeking proclivity could create selection bias if persons with influenza ARI were more (or less) likely to seek care than persons with non-influenza ARI. However, selection bias was only meaningful when rates of care seeking between influenza ARI and non-influenza ARI were very different. In the observational study, the bias-naive VE estimate of 55% (95% CI, 47--62%) was trivially different from the bias-adjusted VE estimate of 57% (95% CI, 49--63%).
   Conclusions: In combination, these studies suggest that while selection bias is possible in test-negative VE studies, this bias in unlikely to be meaningful under conditions likely to be encountered in practice. Researchers and public health officials can continue to rely on VE estimates from test-negative studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Influenza vaccination may provide a "back-boost" to antibodies against previously encountered strains. If the back-boost effect is common, this could allow more aggressive vaccine updates, as emerging variants would be expected to both elicit de-novo responses and boost pre-existing responses against recently circulating strains. Here we used the emergence of an antigenically novel A(H3N2) strain to determine whether an antigenically updated vaccine boosted antibodies against historical strains.
   Methods: We performed hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assays on pre- and post-vaccination sera from 124 children 5-17 years old who received 2015-2016 inactivated influenza vaccine, containing an antigenically updated A(H3N2) strain. We evaluated the mean fold increase in HI titer against both the 20152016 vaccine strain and representative strains from two prior antigenic clusters. Factors associated with post-vaccination titers against historical strains were evaluated using linear regression, adjusting for baseline titer.
   Results: Geometric mean titers against each antigen examined increased significantly after vaccination (P<.0001). Mean fold increase was 3.29 against the vaccine strain and 1.22-1.46 against historical strains.

AB Background: Parents often use social media such as blogs to inform decisions about vaccinations, however little is known about pediatrician blogs addressing vaccines. The objective of this study was to assess content, citations, audience engagement and accuracy of vaccine information on pediatrician blogs.
   Study design: We conducted a content analysis of vaccine information on pediatrician blogs. A national sample of pediatrician blogs was identified using a search rubric of terms applied to multiple search engines. Inclusion criteria were: (1) the writer identified as a pediatrician (2) US based (3) >= 1 post since 1/1/2014. We identified 84 blogs; 56 fit inclusion criteria. Data were collected on all posts mentioning vaccines from 1/1/14 to 2/28/15. We identified the major topic for each post, examined citations to determine sources of information and counted the number of comments per post to evaluate audience engagement. We assessed accuracy of vaccine information using evaluation criteria adapted from information for parents on the CDC website.
   Results: We identified 324 unique blog posts containing information about vaccines on 31 pediatrician blogs. The most common major topic was vaccine-specific posts (36%); Influenza and MMR were the most prevalent. Other common topics included: activism against anti-vaccine information (21%), vaccine exemptions (10%), autism (8%), and vaccine safety (6%). Activism against anti-vaccine information was the topic with the most reader engagement. The most common sources cited were governmental organizations such as the CDC and WHO (34%), and medical journals (31%). All blogs except 2 included information that was consistent with CDC information.
   Conclusions: Pediatrician bloggers frequently address vaccinations; most provide accurate information. Pediatrician blogs may be a new source to provide vaccine education to parents via social media. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Improving CD8+ T cell responses activated by subunit vaccination is crucial for improving vaccine efficacy and safety. Here we report a carrier-adjuvant system composed of self-assembling peptide nanofibers presenting an immunodominant antigen from herpes simplex virus (HSV) and toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists that induces robust effector and memory CD8+ T cell responses in mice. The effector function of vaccine-induced CD8+ T cells was influenced by the type of TLR agonist. The use of CpG (TLR9 agonist) resulted in significantly greater specific in vivo cytotoxicity and trended towards more cells producing both IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha compared to gardiquimod (TLR7 agonist). Prime-boost immunization with peptide nanofibers combined with either adjuvant resulted in development of HSV-specific CD8+ memory T cells further demonstrating the capability of the carrier-adjuvant system to induce strong HSV-specific CD8+ T cell responses. Inclusion of peptide epitope-nanofibers in protein-based subunit vaccines should increase the functional spectrum of the vaccine-elicited immune response and protection. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: The present study aimed to estimate residents' willingness to accept a future H7N9 vaccine and its determinants in the general adult population in Beijing, China.
   Methods: We conducted a multi-stage sampling, cross-sectional survey using self-administered anonymous questionnaires from May to June, in 2014. The main outcome variable was residents' willingness to accept a future H7N9 vaccine. Logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of vaccination willingness.
   Results: Of the 7264 eligible participants, 14.5% of Beijing residents reported that they had not heard of H7N9. Among those who had heard of H7N9, 59.5% of the general adult population would be willing to accept a future H7N9 vaccine, and approximately half of them reported 'I am afraid of being infected by H7N9' and 'H7N9 vaccine can prevent infections', and 28.1% reported 'my daily life is affected by H7N9'. The variables that were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of reporting willingness were being younger adults (aged 18-29 years: OR = 1.52, 95% Cl: 1.17-1.97; aged 30-39 years: OR = 1.39, 95% Cl: 1.08-1.78), being farmers (OR = 1.61; 95% Cl: 1.32-1.96), being unemployed people (OR = 1.36; 95% CI: 1.04-1.78), living in suburban areas (OR = 2.18; 95% Cl: 1.89-2.51), having >= 2 children in the family (OR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.03-1.92), perceived risk in China (OR = 1.30; 95% Cl: 1.15-1.48), perceived susceptibility to disease (OR = 3.13; 95% Cl: 2.73-3.58), perceived negative effect on daily life (OR = 1.32; 95% Cl: 1.13-1.55), perceived effectiveness of vaccination (OR = 2.34; 95% CI: 2.07-2.64), and recent uptake of influenza vaccine (OR = 2.26; 95% Cl: 1.92-2.66).
   Conclusions: A great number of Beijing residents had doubts about the vaccine's effectiveness and were not concerned about disease risk, which were the factors affecting willingness to be vaccinated. Targeted education programs on disease risk as well as vaccine's effectiveness are needed to improve the willingness of vaccination for potential H7N9 pandemic preparedness. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: To identify a potential nadir of the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV) in infancy on invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) in children under 16 in Germany.
   Methods: Active surveillance on IPD based on two independent data sources with capture-recapture correction for underreporting. Annual incidence rates by age group, serotypes, site of infection, and relative incidence reduction compared to pre-vaccination period (1997-2001) at nadir and for the most recent season are reported. We calculated vaccine coverage at the age of 24 months using health insurance claims data.
   Results: 96-97% of children had received at least two doses of PCV since 2009. The maximum impact on overall IPD incidence was achieved in 2012/13 (-48% [95% Cl: -55%; -39%]) with a rebound to -26% [95% CI: -36%; -16%] in 2015/16. Non-PCV13 serotypes accounted for 84.1% of the IPD cases in 2015/16. The most frequent non-PCV serotypes in IPD in 2014/15 and 2015/16 were 10A, 24F, 15C, 12F, 38, 22F, 23B, and 15B. The impact at nadir was highest in children 0-1 years of age both in meningitis and non-meningitis cases, whereas the impact for other age groups was higher for meningitis cases. The rebound mainly pertained to non-meningitis cases.
   Conclusion: The maximum impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination has been attained and signs of a rebound are apparent. Sustained surveillance for IPD in children is warranted to assess whether these trends will continue. There may be a need for vaccines using antigens common to all serotypes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Superinfection of individuals already infected with HIV-1 suggests that pre-existing immune responses may not adequately protect against re-infection. We assessed high-risk female sex workers initially infected with HIV-1 clades A, D or A/D recombinants, to determine if HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies were lacking prior to superinfection.
   Methods: Six superinfected female sex workers previously stratified by HIV-1 high-risk behavior, infecting virus clade and volunteer CD4 counts were evaluated at baseline (n = 5) and at 350 days post-superinfection (n = 6); one superinfected volunteer lacked pre-superinfection plasma. Retrospective plasmas were assessed for neutralization of a multi-clade panel of 12 HIV-1 viruses before superinfection, and then at quarterly intervals thereafter. Similarly stratified singly infected female sex workers were correspondingly assessed at baseline (n = 19) and 350 days after superinfection (n = 24). Neutralization of at least 50% of the 12 viruses (broad neutralization), and geometric means of the neutralization titers (IC50) were compared before and after superinfection; and were correlated with the volunteer HIV-1 superinfection status, CD4 counts, and pseudovirus clade.
   Results: Preexisting broad neutralization occurred in 80% (4/5) of the superinfected subjects with no further broadening by 350 days after superinfection. In one of the five subjects, HIV-1 superinfection occurred when broad neutralization was lacking; with subsequent broadening of neutralizing antibodies occuring within 9 months and plateauing by 30 months after detection of superinfection. Clade B and C pseudoviruses were more sensitive to neutralization (13; [87%]); and (12; [80%]) than the locally circulating clades A (10; [67%1) and D (6; [40%]), respectively (p = 0.025). Low antibody titers correlated with clade D viruses and with >500 CD4 T cell counts, but not with the superinfection status.
   Conclusion: These data demonstrate that HIV-1 superinfection can occur both in the presence, and in the absence of broadly neutralizing antibodies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB On May 21st, 2015, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) convened a workshop on delivery devices for nucleic acid (NA) as vaccines in order to review the landscape of past and future technologies for administering NA (e.g., DNA, RNA, etc.) as antigen into target tissues of animal models and humans. Its focus was on current and future applications for preventing and treating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) disease, among other infectious-disease priorities. Meeting participants presented the results and experience of representative clinical trials of NA vaccines using a variety of alternative delivery devices, as well as a broader group of methods studied in animal models and at bench top, to improve upon the performance and/or avoid the drawbacks of conventional needle-syringe (N-S) delivery. The subjects described and discussed included (1) delivery targeted into oral, cutaneous/intradermal, nasal, upper and lower respiratory, and intramuscular tissues; (2) devices and techniques for jet injection, solid, hollow, and dissolving microneedles, patches for topical passive diffusion or iontophoresis, electroporation, thermal microporation, nasal sprayers, aerosol upper-respiratory and pulmonary inhalation, stratum-corneum ablation by ultrasound, chemicals, and mechanical abrasion, and kinetic/ballistic delivery; (3) antigens, adjuvants, and carriers such as DNA, messenger RNA, synthesized plasmids, chemokines, wet and dry aerosols, and pollen-grain and microparticle vectors; and (4) the clinical experience and humoral, cellular, and cytokine immune responses observed for many of these target tissues, technologies, constructs, and carriers. This report summarizes the presentations and discussions from the workshop (https://web. archive.org/web/20160228112310/https://www.bIsmeetings.net/NucleicAcidDeliveryDevices/), which was webcast live in its entirety and archived online (http://videocast.nih.govisummary.asp?live=16059).

TI How close are countries of the WHO European Region to achieving the goal

AB Background: Influenza vaccination is recommended especially for persons at risk of complications. In 2003, the World Health Assembly urged Member States (MS) to increase vaccination coverage to 75% among older persons by 2010.
   Objective: To assess progress towards the 2010 vaccination goal and describe seasonal influenza vaccination recommendations in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region.
   Methods: Data on seasonal influenza vaccine recommendations, dose distribution, and target group coverage were obtained from two sources: European Union and European Economic Area MS data were extracted from influenza vaccination surveys covering seven seasons (2008/2009-2014/2015) published by the Vaccine European New Integrated Collaboration Effort and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. For the remaining WHO European MS, a separate survey on policies and uptake for all seasons (2008/2009-2014/2015) was distributed to national immunization programmes in 2015.
   Results: Data was available from 49 of 53 MS. All but two had a national influenza vaccination policy. High-income countries distributed considerably higher number of vaccines per capita (median; 139.2 per 1000 population) compared to lower-middle-income countries (median; 6.1 per 1000 population). Most countries recommended vaccination for older persons, individuals with chronic disease, healthcare workers, and pregnant women. Children were included in < 50% of national policies. Only one country reached 75% coverage in older persons (2014/2015), while a number of countries reported declining vaccination uptake. Coverage of target groups was overall low, but with large variations between countries. Vaccination coverage was not monitored for several groups.
   Conclusions: Despite policy recommendations, influenza vaccination uptake remains suboptimal. Low levels of vaccination is not only a missed opportunity for preventing influenza in vulnerable groups, but could negatively affect pandemic preparedness. Improved understanding of barriers to influenza vaccination is needed to increase uptake and reverse negative trends. Furthermore, implementation of vaccination coverage monitoring is critical for assessing performance and impact of the programmes. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV infections are associated with impaired responses to neo-antigens contained in hepatitis A virus (HAV)/hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccines, yet responsible mechanisms are unclear.
   Methods: ACTG 5232 and CFAR0910 were clinical trials where pre-vaccine levels of plasma IP10, IL-6, sCD163 and sCD14 were measured in viremic HCV- (n = 15) or HIV-infected participants (n = 24) and uninfected controls (n = 10). Accelerated dosing HAV/HBV vaccine and tetanus booster were administered and antibody response was measured at 0, 1, 3, 8, and 24 weeks.
   Results: Pre-vaccine plasma IP10, IL-6, and sCD14 levels were elevated in both HCV and HIV-infected participants, while sCD163 was also elevated in HCV-infected participants. Pre-immunization tetanus antibody levels were lower in HIV-infected than in uninfected participants, while vaccine induced antibody responses were intact in HCV and HIV-infected participants. After HAV/HBV vaccination, HCV and HIV-infected participants had lower and less durable HAV and HBV antibody responses than uninfected controls.
   Among HCV-infected participants, pre-vaccine plasma IP10, IL-6, sCD14, and sCD163 levels inversely correlated with HAV, HBV and tetanus antibody responses after vaccine. Low HAV/HBV vaccine responses in HIV-infected participants prohibited assessment of immune correlates.
   Conclusions: During HCV and HIV infection markers of systemic inflammation reflect immune dysfunction as demonstrated by poor response to HAV/HBV neo-antigen vaccine. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: Offering HPV vaccine in settings beyond the traditional medical home holds promise for increasing the currently low levels of coverage. As adolescents frequently visit dentists, dental practices may be one such alternative vaccination setting. This study assessed parent attitudes about the roles dental providers could play in HPV prevention, including vaccine provision.
   Methods: In September 2016, we conducted an online survey using a national sample (n = 1209) of U.S. parents of adolescent children aged 11-17. Adolescents' mean age was 14; 53% were male and 62% were non-Hispanic white. We identified correlates of parents' comfort with dentists as HPV vaccinators using multivariable logistic regression.
   Results: Overall, 23% of parents reported that they would feel comfortable with their child receiving HPV vaccine from a dentist. In multivariable analyses, parents had greater odds of being comfortable if they had higher trust in their child's primary care provider (OR = 1.27, 95% Cl: 0.96-1.68) and lower odds if their child was female (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.50-0.86). Convenience (20%) and oral health expertise (20%) were the most commonly cited benefits of dentists administering the vaccine. Wanting their child's regular provider to administer and track vaccinations (61% and 58%, respectively), and lack of insurance coverage (30%) were the most commonly cited concerns. Parents expressed somewhat greater comfort with roles dentists might play in promoting HPV vaccination other than vaccine delivery, such as providing education.
   Conclusions: Parents in this sample had low comfort with dentists as HPV vaccinators. Findings from this study highlight potential concerns to be addressed before dental practices consider offering HPV vaccination in the future. Further research should assess dentists' perspectives and explore alternative roles for dental providers in HPV prevention efforts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE Influenza, human; Influenza, vaccines; Incidence
ID ILLNESSES
AB Background: In addition to preventing hospitalizations and deaths due to influenza, influenza vaccination programs can reduce the burden of outpatient visits for influenza. We estimated the incidence of medically-attended influenza at three geographically diverse sites in the United States, and the cases averted by vaccination, for the 2013/14 through 2015/16 influenza seasons.
   Methods: We defined surveillance populations at three sites from the United States Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network. Among these populations, we identified outpatient visits laboratory-confirmed influenza via active surveillance, and identified all outpatient visits for acute respiratory illness from healthcare databases. We extrapolated the total number of outpatient visits for influenza from the proportion of surveillance visits with a positive influenza test. We combined estimates of incidence, vaccine coverage, and vaccine effectiveness to estimate outpatient visits averted by vaccination.
   Results: Across the three sites and seasons, incidence of medically attended influenza ranged from 14 to 54 per 1000 population. Incidence was highest in children aged 6 months to 9 years (33 to 70 per 1000) and lowest in adults aged 18-49 years (21 to 27 per 1000). Cases averted ranged from 9 per 1000 vaccinees (Washington, 2014/15) to 28 per 1000 (Wisconsin, 2013/14).
   Discussion: Seasonal influenza epidemics cause a considerable burden of outpatient medical visits. The United States influenza vaccination program has caused meaningful reductions in outpatient visits for influenza, even in years when the vaccine is not well-matched to the dominant circulating influenza strain.

AB Background: The magnitude of an individual's serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) response to a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) has been associated with the vaccine's protective efficacy against carriage of pneumococci of that serotype, though the relationship with other serotypes needs to be understood.
   Methods: Using immunogenicity data collected during a trial comparing the 7-valent (PCV7) and 13-valent (PCV13) vaccines, we measured associations between serotype-specific IgG levels, and used multiple regressions to identify demographic predictors of response.
   Results: Vaccine-induced IgG levels were moderately positively correlated with one another, with pair wise correlation coefficients of 0.40-0.70. Principal component analysis of vaccine-serotype responses yielded one principal component indicating general immune responsiveness, and a second principal component mainly describing responses to serotype 14, which was the least correlated with the other responses. Overall, demographic variables explained only 17.0 and 20.4% of the geometric mean PCV7 and PCV13 responses, respectively. In both groups, older age at the first vaccine dose and shorter time from vaccination to antibody measurement were independently associated with stronger geometric mean responses.
   Discussion: Improved understanding of the nature and causes of variation in immune response may aid in optimizing vaccination schedules and identifying robust correlates of protection. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Varicella vaccine was introduced into the Brazilian Immunization Program in October 2013, as a single-dose schedule administered at 15 months of age. Its effectiveness had not yet been assessed in the country.
   Methods: A matched case-control study was carried out in Sao Paulo and Goiania (Southeast and Midwest regions, respectively), Brazil. Suspected cases, were identified through a prospective surveillance established in the study sites. All cases had specimens from skin lesion collected for molecular laboratory testing. Cases were confirmed by either clinical or PCR of skin lesions and classified as mild, moderate, and severe disease.
   Methods: Two neighborhood controls were selected for each case. Cases and controls were aged 15-32 months and interviewed at home. Evidence of prior vaccination was obtained from vaccination cards. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used, and odds ratio and its respective 95% confidence intervals were estimated. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated by comparing de odds of having received varicella vaccine among cases and controls.
   Results: A total of 168 cases and 301 controls were enrolled. Moderate and severe illness, was found in 33.3% and 9.9% of the cases. Effectiveness of a single dose varicella vaccine was 86% (95%Cl 72-92%) against disease of any severity and 93% (95%Cl 82-97%) against moderate and severe disease. Out of 168 cases, 81.8% had positive PCR results for wild-type strains, and 22.0% were breakthrough varicella cases. Breakthrough cases were milder compared to non-breakthrough cases (p < .001).
   Conclusions: Effectiveness of single dose varicella vaccine in Brazil is comparable to that in other countries where breakthrough varicella cases have also been found to occur. The goal of the varicella vaccination program, along with disease burden and affordability should be taken into consideration when considering the adoption of a second dose of varicella vaccine into national immunization programs.

AB Norovirus (NoV) is the main cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide across all age groups. Current NoV vaccine candidates are based on non-infectious highly immunogenic virus-like particles (VLPs) produced in cell cultures in vitro. As NoVs infecting human population are highly divergent, it is proposed that the vaccine should contain at least two different NoV genotypes, potentially affecting the immunogenicity of each other. We investigated the immunogenicity of NoV GII.4 VLPs administered by intramuscular (IM) or intradermal (ID) injections to BALB/c mice either alone or co-delivered with genogroup I (GI) and other genogroup GII VLPs. Serum NoV-specific IgG binding antibody titers and antibody functionality in terms of avidity and blocking potential were assessed. Furthermore, the specificity and functional avidity of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses were analyzed using synthetic peptides previously identified to contain NoV VP1 P2 domain-specific H-2(d) epitopes. The results showed that IM and ID immunization induced comparable GII.4-specific antibodies and T cell responses. Similar magnitude and functionality of antibodies and interferon-gamma producing T cells were developed using monovalent GII.4 VLPs or different genotype combinations. For the first time, degranulation assay using multicolor flow cytometry showed that NoV GII.4-specific CD8(+) T cells had cytotoxic T lymphocyte phenotype. To conclude, our results demonstrate that there is no immunological interference even if up to five different NoV VLP genotypes were co-administered at the same time. Furthermore, no inhibition of NoV-specific antibody functionality or the magnitude, specificity and affinity of T cell responses was observed in any of the immunized animals, observations relevant for the development of a multivalent NoV VLP vaccine.

   and supply balance

DT Article
DE BCG; Tuberculosis; Shortages; Stock-outs; Supply; Demand
ID TUBERCULOSIS; PROTECTION
AB Over the past decade, several countries across all regions, income groups and procurement methods have been unable to secure sufficient BCG vaccine supply. While the frequency of stock-outs has remained rather stable, duration increased in 2014-2015 due to manufacturing issues and attracted the attention of national, regional and global immunization stakeholders. This prompted an in-depth analysis of supply and demand dynamics aiming to characterize supply risks. This analysis is unique as it provides a global picture, where previous analyses have focused on a portion of the market procuring through UN entities. Through literature review, supplier interviews, appraisal of shortages, stock-outs and historical procurement data, and through demand forecasting, this analysis shows an important increase in global capacity in 2017: supply is sufficient to meet forecasted BCG vaccine demand and possibly buffer market shocks. Nevertheless, risks remain mainly due to supply concentration and limited investment in production process improvements, as well as inflexibility in demand. Identification of these market risks will allow implementation of risk-mitigating interventions in three areas: (1) enhancing information sharing between major global health actors, countries and suppliers, (2) identifying interests and incentives to expand product registration and investment in the BCG manufacturing process, and (3) working with countries for tighter vaccine management.

AB Background: Australia is one of only a few countries with a long-standing and consistent serosurveillance program. We conducted a national serosurvey in 2012-2013 to estimate population seroprevalence of measles-specific IgG and the effective reproduction number, R, and compare the results with the three previous serosurveys (1996-1999, 2002 and 2007) to examine trends following a decade of sustained measles control.
   Methods: 2729 residual sera from 1 to 49 year olds were tested using the Enzygnost anti-measles IgG enzyme immunoassay (EIA). All sera in the equivocal range by EIA on re-testing and a random sample of low positive and negative sera were later tested by a microneutralisation assay. R was calculated from weighted estimates of the proportion seronegative by age using a previously developed contact matrix.
   Results: In the 2012-13 serosurvey, anti-measles IgG seropositivity for 1-49 year olds was 80.8% (95% CI: 79.4-82.3%) and 8.9% (95% CI: 7.8-10.0%) had equivocal antibody levels. The increasing proportion of seronegative and equivocal individuals in age groups 10-39 years continued a trend seen in previous serosurveys. There was also an increase in equivocal results among 2-4 and 5-9 year old children, >90% of whom were recently vaccinated. R increased from 0.57 in 1999 to above the epidemic threshold of 1 in 2012-13 (R = 1.7). All 20 EIA negative sera, 238/241 (98.8%) equivocal sera, and 89/92 (96.7%) low positive sera had a titre <10 (negative) in the measles microneutralisation assay.
   Conclusions: A number of countries with sustained measles control have now demonstrated that measles-specific IgG antibodies decline with time since vaccination. As there is good epidemiologic evidence of population-level protection, the implications of declining measles-specific IgG antibody levels for maintaining measles elimination are unclear. Novel studies to determine correlates of protection against measles transmission and disease in the post-elimination era are needed to help answer this question. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Development of an HIV vaccine might be essential to ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic. However, vaccines can result in the emergence and spread of vaccine-resistant strains. Indeed, analyses of breakthrough infections in the HIV phase 3 vaccine trial RV144 identified HIV genotypes with differential rates of transmission in vaccine and placebo recipients. We hypothesized that, for HIV vaccination programs based on partially effective vaccines similar to RV144, HIV adaptation will rapidly diminish the expected vaccine impact.
   Methods and findings: Using two HIV epidemic models, we simulated large-scale vaccination programs and, critically, included HIV strain diversity with respect to the vaccine response. We show here that rapid population-level viral adaptation can lead to decreased overall vaccine efficacy and substantially fewer infections averted by vaccination, when comparing scenarios with and without viral evolution (with outcomes depending on vaccination coverage, vaccine efficacy against the sensitive allele, and the initial resistant allele frequency). Translating this to the epidemic in South Africa, a scenario with 70% vaccination coverage may result in 250,000 infections (non-averted by vaccination) within 10 years of vaccine rollout that are due solely to HIV adaptation, all else being equal.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that approaches to HIV vaccine development, program implementation, and epidemic modeling may require attention to viral adaptation in response to vaccination. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Seasonal influenza vaccination for healthy children was introduced in Northern Ireland in the 2013/14 flu season, with an initial pilot year involving two specific cohorts, followed by rollout to all children aged 411 years in subsequent seasons. This study aimed to examine the impact of that programme on the burden of flu in primary care over the study period 2010/11-2016/17.
   Two routine indicators were used to measure impact - GP in-hour consultations and out-of-hour calls for influenza and influenza-like-illness (ILI). Analysis was conducted overall and stratified by age; rates in children under 14 years of age to measure direct impact and rates in individuals 14 years and over to measure indirect impact. Seven influenza seasons were included, three pre-programme seasons (2010/11-2012/13: phase 0), one pilot season (2013/14: phase 1), and three post-programme seasons (2014/15-2016/17: phase 2).
   High uptake of vaccination was observed from the programme introduction, with consistent uptake of over 50% in pre-school age groups and over 75% in primary school age groups. Statistically significant reductions were found in GP in-hours consultations and in out-of-hour calls in phase 2 compared to phase 0, both overall (GP in-hours RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38-0.98, p = .040; out-of-hours RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27-0.97, p = .041) and in the under 14 years group (GP in-hours RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.19-0.75, p = .006; out-of-hours RR 0.39, 95% Cl 0.19-0.83, p = .014).
   Our results suggest that there have been reductions in the burden of flu in primary care settings overall and in children aged under 14 years in the seasons since the introduction of healthy children influenza vaccination. Further seasons should be added to subsequent analyses to strengthen this evidence. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study assessed the impact of vaccination on the RV gastroenteritis (RVGE) burden in children aged <5 years old (y) by comparing RVGE hospitalizations and outpatient visits during pre-vaccination (2007-2011), transition (2011-2012) and subsidization (2012-2016) periods.
   Methods: All hospitalizations and outpatient visits in children aged <5 y from 2 administrative districts of Nagoya city were identified from the hospital-based electronic databases of 4 hospitals. RVGE cases were identified by diagnostic code and/or positive results of diagnostic kits.
   Results: Compared to the pre-vaccination period, there was a decrease in RVGE hospitalizations for children <5 y from 5.59 per 1000 person-year (kPY) to 3.65/kPY in the subsidization period (i.e. 34.69%). In children <1 y, the incidence of RVGE hospitalizations decreased continuously from 6.62/kPY in the pre vaccination period to 1.84/kPY in the subsidization period (i.e. 72.19%). The highest decrease was observed in the subsidization season i.e. when high coverage was reached: 69% and 75.57% in the 2013/2014 season for 2-3 y and 3-4 y, and 74.03% in the 2014/2015 season for 4-5 y, respectively. Proportion of RVGE outpatient visits decreased by 87.44% for children <1 y and 57.05% for <5 y from the pre-vaccination to the subsidization period. This decrease started the first year of subsidization for children <1 y, 1-2 y and 2-3 y (78.89%, 18.86% and 5.80%) and the second year (2013/2014 season) for children 3-4 y and 4-5 y (87.73% and 51.78%).
   Conclusions: Although yearly fluctuations have been observed, the introduction of vaccination significantly decreased pediatric RVGE hospitalizations and outpatient visits, especially in the age group eligible for vaccination. During the second and third year of subsidization, we observed a herd protection effect on other age groups <5 y who were not eligible for vaccination. (C) 2017 GlaxoSmithKline SA.

AB Background: Seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) is an effective and safe way to prevent influenza. Public health institutions around the world consequently recommend SIV to certain groups at risk, including healthcare worker's (HCWs). Even if SIV is free of charge, the vaccination coverage rate remains low, however. The aim of this study was to gain information on the sociodemographics, lifestyle and knowledge of HCWs associated with their attitude to SIV, also investigating the differences between different professional categories of HCW.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted over six consecutive weeks from October to December 2016. It was based on an anonymous online questionnaire administered to all employees (N = 9633) of the South Tyrolean Health Service. Coverage rates and attitudes to SIV were assessed by type of HCW. A logistic regression analysis was run to test the associations between SIV in the winter of 2015/2016 and potential predictors of the HCWs' attitude to vaccination.
   Results: In all, 4091 employees (42.4% of the total) took part in the study. Statistically significant differences emerged between the different healthcare professions in terms of their reported vaccination rates and their attitudes to SIV. Among the different types of HCW, physicians had the highest rate of vaccination uptake. There were sociocultural and lifestyle factors associated with SIV in HCWs, as well as these worker's professional roles and the ward where they worked. All the professionals agreed that specific training was the best way to improve HCW vaccination rates.
   Conclusion: Low compliance with SIV among HCWs is attributable to numerous factors, some of which relate to their attitude to health issues. Commitment and accountability to patients and society should be further developed in HCWs. Specific training and information, also through informal scientific channels, should be provided to improve their knowledge of influenza and attitude to vaccination. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Parental decision making about childhood vaccinations is complex and multidimensional. There is a perception that the number of parents having concerns regarding childhood vaccinations has been increasing in Canada. The aim of this study was to explore vaccine hesitancy among Canadian parents and to examine factors associated with a parent's intention to vaccinate his/her child. Informed by the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) this study assesses potential associations between parents' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs toward vaccination and their intention to vaccinate their child in the future. A national sample of Canadian parents of children aged 24-59 months (N = 2013) was surveyed using an online survey methodology. Half of the surveyed parents strongly intended to have their child vaccinated in the future. Parents' information needs and searches as well as parents' trust in different institutions were associated with intention to vaccinate. Parents who reported having frequently looked for vaccine information, who considered that it was their role as parents to question vaccines, or who had previously experienced difficulty accessing vaccination services were less likely to strongly intend to vaccinate their child in the future. Parents who had a high level of trust in doctors and public health were most likely to strongly intend to vaccinate their child. Results of the multivariate analysis showed that positive attitudes (aOR = 8.0; 95% CI: 6.0, 10.4), higher perceived social support (aOR = 3.0; 95% CI: 2.3, 3.93), and higher perceived behavioural control (aOR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.4, 2.43) were associated with parents' intention to vaccinate their child. Findings of this study suggest that trust-building interventions that promote pro-vaccine social norms and that address negative attitudes toward vaccination could enhance vaccine acceptance among Canadian parents.

ID COLD CHAIN; STORAGE
AB Background: Vaccines should be stored and handled according to manufacturer specifications. Inadequate cold chain management can affect potency; but, limited data exist on adverse events (AE) following administration of vaccines kept outside of recommended temperatures.
   Objective: To describe reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) involving vaccines inappropriately stored outside of recommended temperatures and/or exposed to temperatures outside of manufacturer specifications for inappropriate amounts of time.
   Methods: We searched the VAERS database (analytic period 2008-2012) for reports describing vaccines kept outside of recommended temperatures. We analyzed reports by vaccine type, length outside of recommended temperature and type of temperature excursion, AE following receipt of potentially compromised vaccine, and reasons for cold chain breakdown.
   Results: We identified 476 reports of vaccines kept outside of recommended temperatures; 77% described cluster incidents involving multiple patients. The most commonly reported vaccines were quadrivalent human papillomavirus (n = 146, 30%), 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide (n = 51, 11%), and measles, mumps, and rubella (n = 45, 9%). Length of time vaccines were kept outside of recommended temperatures ranged from 15 mins to 6 months (median 51 h). Most (n = 458, 96%) reports involved patients who were administered potentially compromised vaccines; AE were reported in 32 (7%), with local reactions (n = 21) most frequent. Two reports described multiple patients contracting diseases they were vaccinated against, indicating possible influenza vaccine failure. Lack of vigilance, inadequate training, and equipment failure were reasons cited for cold chain management breakdowns.
   Conclusions: Our review does not indicate any substantial direct health risk from administration of vaccines kept outside of recommended temperatures. However, there are potential costs and risks, including vaccine wastage, possible decreased protection, and patient and parent inconvenience related to revaccination. Maintaining high vigilance, proper staff training, regular equipment maintenance, and having adequate auxiliary power are important components of comprehensive vaccine cold chain management.

AB Introduction: Currently four recombinant hepatitis B (HepB) vaccines are in use in the United States. HepB vaccines are recommended for infants, children and adults. We assessed adverse events (AEs) following HepB vaccines reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a national spontaneous reporting system.
   Methods: We searched VAERS for reports of AEs following single antigen HepB vaccine and HepB-containing vaccines (either given alone or with other vaccines), from January 2005 - December 2015. We conducted descriptive analyses and performed empirical Bayesian data mining to assess disproportionate reporting. We reviewed serious reports including reports of special interest.
   Results: VAERS received 20,231 reports following HepB or HepB-containing vaccines: 10,291 (51%) in persons <2 years of age; 2588 (13%) in persons 2-18 years and 5867 (29%) in persons >18 years; for 1485 (7.3%) age was missing. Dizziness and nausea (8.4% each) were the most frequently reported AEs following a single antigen HepB vaccine: fever (23%) and injection site erythema (11%) were most frequent following Hep-containing vaccines. Of the 4444 (22%) reports after single antigen HepB vaccine, 303 (6.8%) were serious, including 45 deaths. Most commonly reported cause of death was Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (197). Most common non-death serious reports following single antigen HepB vaccines among infants aged <1 month, were nervous system disorders (15) among children aged 123 months; infections and infestation (8) among persons age 2-18 years blood and lymphatic systemic disorders; and general disorders and administration site conditions among persons age >18 years. Most common vaccination error following single antigen HepB was incorrect product storage.
   Conclusions: Review current U.S.-licensed HepB vaccines administered alone or in combination with other vaccines did not reveal new or unexpected safety concerns. Vaccination errors were identified which indicate the need for training and education of providers on HepB vaccine indications and recommendations. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: In September 2015, the United Kingdom became the first country to introduce the multi component group B meningococcal vaccine (4CMenB) into a national infant immunisation programme. In early clinical trials 51-61% of infants developed a fever when 4CMenB was administered with other routine vaccines. Whilst administration of prophylactic paracetamol is advised, up to 3% of parents may seek medical advice for fever following vaccination. We used research-level general practitioner consultations to identify any increase in attendances for all-cause fever in vaccine-eligible infants following 4CMenB introduction in England.
   Methods: Consultations for infant all-cause fever in the year following the vaccine introduction were identified from The Phoenix Partnership (TPP) ResearchOne general practice database using Read (CTV3) codes. Average daily consultation rates and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated for vaccine-eligible age groups and compared to the two years preceding vaccine introduction. The difference between pre- and post-vaccine all-cause fever consultations was estimated.
   Results: All-cause fever consultations in vaccine-eligible 7-10 week olds were 1.6-fold higher (IRR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.22-2.05) compared to the two previous years and 1.5-fold higher (IRR 1.47; 95% CI, 1.17-1.86) in 15-18 week-olds. There were no significant differences in 0-6 or 11-14 week-olds. Applying the difference between pre- and post-vaccine consultation rates to the 4CMenB vaccine-eligible age groups across England estimated 1825 additional fever consultations in the year following 4CMenB introduction.
   Conclusions: We found a small but significant difference in all-cause fever consultation rates in vaccine eligible infants who would have received 4CMenB with other vaccines. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Predictors of measles vaccination coverage among children 6-59 months co

AB Background: Measles is a significant contributor to child mortality in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), despite routine immunization programs and supplementary immunization activities (SIA). Further, national immunization coverage levels may hide disparities among certain groups of children, making effective measles control even more challenging. This study describes measles vaccination coverage and reporting methods and identifies predictors of vaccination among children participating in the 2013-2014 DRC Demographic and Health Survey (DHS).
   Methods: We examined vaccination coverage of 6947 children aged 6-59 months. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of vaccination among children reporting vaccination via dated card in order to identify least reached children. We also assessed spatial distribution of vaccination report type by rural versus urban residence.
   Results: Urban children with educated mothers were more likely to be vaccinated (OR = 4.1,95% CI: 1.6, 10.7) versus children of mothers with no education, as were children in wealthier rural families (OR = 2.9, 95% Cl: 1.9, 4.4). At the provincial level, urban areas more frequently reported vaccination via dated card than rural areas.
   Conclusions: Results indicate that, while the overall coverage level of 70% is too low, socioeconomic and geographic disparities also exist which could make some children even less likely to be vaccinated. Dated records of measles vaccination must be increased, and groups of children with the greatest need should be targeted. As access to routine vaccination services is limited in DRC, identifying and targeting under reached children should be a strategic means of increasing country-wide effective measles control.

AB In this study, all-natural composite microspheres were fabricated through adding shellac into chitin solution followed by self-assembly via thermally-induced phase separation. The pore structure of the composite microspheres was altered into wedge-shape from ink-bottle-shape of the chitin microspheres, whereas, the crystalline structure of these two kinds of microspheres remained unaltered. The as-fabricated chitin-shellac composite microspheres were used for enzyme immobilization through adsorption. And yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (YADH) was chosen as the model enzyme, which is a multimer consisting of 4 subunits. The loading capacity of the as-prepared composite microspheres was up to 79.0 mg/g (enzyme/carrier). The immobilized enzyme exhibited a comparable catalytic activity compared to its free counterpart and maintained 49.3% of its initial activity after 54 days' storage at 4 degrees C while the free enzyme lost all its activity.

AB As the important chiral building block of levetiracetam, the synthesis of (S)-2-aminobutanamide has attracted a great deal of attention. The D-aminopeptidase catalyzed kinetic resolution of 2-aminobutanamide was demonstrated as an effective strategy for (S)-2-aminobutanamide production. In this study, a novel D-aminopeptidase from Brucella sp. (Bs-Dap) was screened and systematically characterized. The enzyme exhibited maximum activity at 45 degrees C, pH 8.0 and it showed relatively low Km value toward 2-aminobutanamide, indicating its high affinity to the substrate. Kinetic resolution of 300 g/L 2-aminobutanamide by recombinant Escherichia coli whole cells (4 g/L wet cell weight) resulted in 50% conversion and >99% e.e. within 80 min. The catalytic properties of Bs-Dap demonstrated its great potential for industrial production of (S)-2-aminobutanamide.

AB The rapid detection of foodborne pathogens is critical to ensure food safety. The objective of this study is to select aptamers specifically bound to Escherichia coli O157:H7 using the whole-bacterium SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment) and apply the selected aptamer to a QCM (quartz crystal microbalance) sensor for rapid and sensitive detection of target bacteria. A total of 19 rounds of selection against live E. coli O157: H7 and 6 rounds of counter selection against a mixture of Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella Typhimurium, were performed. The aptamer pool from the last round was cloned and sequenced. One sequence S1 that appeared 16 times was characterized and a dissociation constant (K-d) of 10.30 nM was obtained. Subsequently, a QCM aptasensor was developed for the rapid detection of E. coli O157:H7. The limit of detection (LOD) and the detection time of the aptasensor was determined to be 1.46 x 10(3) CFU/ml and 50 min, respectively. This study demonstrated that the ssDNA aptamer selected by the whole-bacterium SELEX possessed higher sensitivity than previous work and the potential use of the constructed QCM aptasensor in rapid screening of foodborne pathogens.

AB Cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) catalyzes hydrolysis, cyclization, coupling, and disproportionation reactions and is widely used in the starch processing industry. In this work, the expression of CGTase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) was significantly improved by promoter engineering and downstream box evolution. Firstly, the effects of the promoter type (P-T7, P-trp, P-lacUV5, and the hybrid promoters P-tacI and P-tacII) and spacer sequence on the expression of CGTase were examined. P-tacI demonstrated the highest rate of transcriptional activity, which was 4.4-, 7.1-, 3.3-, and 1.5-fold greater than that of P-T7, P-trp, P-lacUV5, and P-tacII, respectively. The spacer sequence of the promoter was optimized using a degenerate base library, and the GC content of the spacer was found to be inversely proportional to CGTase expression. In addition, CGTase expression was higher when TG:CA and TA:TA dimers were present in the spacer sequence. Under the control of the P-tacI promoter with an optimized spacer sequence, extracellular CGTase activity reached 170.6 U/mL, which was seven times higher than that of the original strain (25.2 U/mL). Directed evolution of the downstream box sequence was then performed by randomization of the sequence using degenerate codons, similarly as for the optimization of the spacer sequence. After optimizing the downstream box sequence, CGTase activity increased from 170.6 to 214 U/mL. The results obtained here indicate that in addition to promoter type, the spacer sequence of the promoter and the downstream box are important target elements for improved gene expression.

AB Carotenoids are isoprenoid pigments synthesized exclusively by plants and microorganisms and play critical roles in light harvesting, photoprotection, attracting pollinators and phytohormone production. In recent years, carotenoids have been used for their health benefits due to their high antioxidant activity and are extensively utilized in food, pharmaceutical, and nutraceutical industries. Regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis occurs throughout the life cycle of plants, with vibrant changes in composition based on developmental needs and responses to external environmental stimuli. With advancements in metabolic engineering techniques, there has been tremendous progress in the production of industrially valuable secondary metabolites such as carotenoids. Application of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology has become essential for the successful and improved production of carotenoids. Synthetic biology is an emerging discipline; metabolic engineering approaches may provide insights into novel ideas for biosynthetic pathways. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge on carotenoid biosynthetic pathways and genetic engineering of carotenoids to improve their nutritional value. In addition, we investigated synthetic biological approaches for the production of carotenoids. Theoretical biology approaches that may aid in understanding the biological sciences are discussed in this review. A combination of theoretical knowledge and experimental strategies may improve the production of industrially relevant secondary metabolites.

However, it has not been widely used in the oil industry because necessary conditions cannot always be easily established in an oil reservoir. Novel approaches to MEOR, which are based on newly discovered biosurfactant-mediated MEOR-mechanisms, are discussed in this review. Particularly, the possibility of combining MEOR with chemical enhancement of oil recovery in heterogeneous oil reservoirs, which involves rock surface wettability shifts and emulsion inversions, is discussed. In wider (centimeter/millimeter-scale) rock pores, the activity of (bio) surfactants and microbial cells attached to oil may allow releasing trapped oil blobs through oil-in-water emulsification. After no more oil can be emulsified, the addition of alkali or surfactants, which turn rock surface oil-wet, may help release oil droplets trapped in narrow (micrometer-scale) pores through coalescence of the droplets and water-in-oil emulsification. Experiments demonstrating the possibility of (bio) surfactant-mediated enhancement of immiscible gas-driven oil recovery are also reviewed. Interestingly, very low (bio) surfactant concentrations were shown to be needed for enhancement of immiscible gas-driven oil recovery. Some possible side effects of MEOR, such as unintended bioplugging and microbially influenced corrosion (MIC), are discussed as well.

AB A novel species, Flavobacterium kingsejongi WV39, isolated from feces of Antarctic penguins and a type species of the genus Flavobacterium, is yellow because it synthesizes a C40 carotenoid zeaxanthin. The complete genome of F. kingsejongi WV39 is made up of a single circular chromosome (4,224,053 bp, 39.8% G + C content). Annotation analysis revealed 3,955 coding sequences, 72 RNAs (18 rRNA + 54 tRNA), and five genes involved in zeaxanthin biosynthesis. The key gene encoding beta-carotenoid hydroxylase (CrtZ), which is the last enzyme in the zeaxanthin biosynthetic pathway, was cloned and subjected to complementary analysis in a heterologous E. coli strain. The CrtZ of F. kingsejongi WV39 showed a higher activity than other reported CrtZs.

AB Oil production by water injection often involves the use of makeup water to replace produced oil. Sulfate in makeup water is reduced by sulfate-reducing bacteria to sulfide, a process referred to as souring. In the MHGC field souring was caused by using makeup water with 4 mM (384 ppm) sulfate. Mixing with sulfate-free produced water gave injection water with 0.8 mM sulfate. This was amended with nitrate to limit souring and was then distributed fieldwide. The start-up of an enhanced-oil-recovery pilot caused all sulfate-containing makeup water to be used for dissolution of polymer, which was then injected into a limited region of the field. Produced water from this pilot contained 10% of the injected sulfate concentration as sulfide, but was free of sulfate. Its use as makeup water in the main water plant of the field caused injection water sulfate to drop to zero. This in turn strongly decreased produced sulfide concentrations throughout the field and allowed a decreased injection of nitrate. The decreased injection of sulfate and nitrate caused major changes in the microbial community of produced waters. Limiting sulfate dispersal into a reservoir, which acts as a sulfate-removing biofilter, is thus a powerful method to decrease souring.

AB An efficient production system for optically pure L-and D-lactic acid (LA) from Jerusalem artichoke tuber powder (JAP) was developed by metabolic engineering of Kluyveromyces marxianus. To construct LA-producing strains, the ethanol fermentation pathway of K. marxianus was redirected to LA production by disruption of KmPDC1 and expression of L-and D-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) genes derived from Lactobacillus plantarum under the control of the K. marxianus translation elongation factor 1 alpha promoter. To further increase the LA titer, the L-LA and D-LA consumption pathway of host strains was blocked by deletion of the oxidative LDH genes KmCYB2 and KmDLD1. The recombinant strains produced 130 g/L L-LA and 122 g/L D-LA by direct fermentation from 230 g/L JAP containing 140 g/L inulin, without pretreatment or nutrient supplementation. The conversion efficiency and optical purity were >> > 95% and >> >99%, respectively. This system using JAP and the inulin-assimilating yeast K. marxianus could lead to a cost-effective process for the production of LA.

AB Chromosome-integrated recombinant protein expression in bacteria has advantages for the stable maintenance of genes without any use of antibiotics during large-scale fermentation. Even though different levels of gene expression were reported, depending upon their chromosomal position in bacterial species, only a limited number of integration sites have been used in B. subtilis. In this study, we randomly integrated the GFP and AprE expression cassettes into the B. subtilis genome to determine integration sites that can produce a high yield of heterologous protein expression. Our mariner transposon-based expression cassette integration system was able to find integration sites, which can produce up to 2.9-fold and 1.5-fold increased expression of intracellular GFP and extracellular AprE, respectively, compared to the common integration site amyE. By analyzing the location of integration sites, we observed an adjacent promoter effect, gene dosage effect, and gene knock-out effect all complexly contributing to the increased level of integrated gene expression. Besides obtaining a high yield of heterologous protein expression, our system can also provide a wide-range of expression to expand the systematic application for steady-state metabolic protein production.

AB The non-saccharolytic yeast Pichia pastoris was engineered to express constitutively the mature region of sucrose: sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase (1-SST, EC 2.4.1.99) from Tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceus). The increase of the transgene dosage from one to nine copies enhanced 7.9-fold the recombinant enzyme (Sa1-SSTrec) yield without causing cell toxicity. Secretion driven by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae a-factor signal peptide resulted in periplasmic retention (38%) and extracellular release (62%) of Sa1-SSTrec to an overall activity of 102.1 U/ml when biomass reached (106 g/l, dry weight) in fed-batch fermentation using cane sugar for cell growth. The volumetric productivity of the nine-copy clone PGFT6x-308 at the end of fermentation (72 h) was 1422.2 U/l/h. Sa1-SSTrec purified from the culture supernatant was a monomeric glycoprotein optimally active at pH 5.0-6.0 and 45-50 degrees C. The removal of N-linked oligosaccharides by Endo Hf treatment decreased the enzyme stability but had no effect on the substrate and product specificities. Sa1-SSTrec converted sucrose (600 g/l) into 1-kestose (GF(2)) and nystose (GF(3)) in a ratio 9: 1 with their sum representing 55-60% (w/w) of the total carbohydrates in the reaction mixture. Variations in the sucrose (100-800 g/l) or enzyme (1.5-15 units per gram of substrate) concentrations kept unaltered the product profile. Sa1-SSTrec is an attractive candidate enzyme for the industrial production of short-chain fructooligosaccharides, most particularly 1-kestose.

AB Bacteriocins are antibacterial proteins or peptides synthesized by ribosomes to inhibit or kill both closely related and non-related bacterium. Class IIa bacteriocins possess high activity against foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. A novel strain Lactobacillus plantarum LPL-1 was isolated from fermented fish and considered as a bacteriocin producing probiotic with great antibacterial activity against Listeria monocytogenes 54002. The complete genome of L. plantarum LPL-1 contains one circular chromosome and plasmid. According to the genome, biosynthetic genes of bacteriocin including precursor, immunity protein, accessory protein and transporter protein were identified; and biosynthetic mechanism of class IIa bacteriocin was also further analyzed. The antibacterial activity of purified bacteriocin against L. monocytogenes54002 was determined and the diameter of inhibition zone was about 16.6mm by vernier caliper. This work provided the complete genome information of L. plantarum LPL-1 that could benefit for understanding the biosynthetic mechanism of class IIa bacteriocin as well as the potential application of L. plantarum LPL-1 in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical.

AB Fowl adenoviruses (FAdVs) are widely considered as excellent platforms for vaccine development and gene therapy. We improved on our right-end partial TR-2 deleted or a left-end 2.3 kb deleted vectors by developing a single, dual-site delivery vector. We demonstrated that, in addition to ORF11, the right end ORF17 is also dispensable. To further improve the capacity and flexibility of the FAdV-9 based vector system, we generated an infectious recombinant FAdV-9 dual-site expression clone lacking 1.9 kb of the left end and replaced with mCherry under the control of a native promoter, and 3.6 kb of the right-end replaced with an EGFP expression cassette. Five intermediate FAdmid clones were successfully constructed: a) pFAdV-9.0-2RED (mCherry replacing the left end 2.2 kb ORF0 to 2); b) pFAdV-9RED (mCherry replacing the left end 1.9 kb ORF1 to 2); c) pFAdV-9.17 (deletion of ORF17 and 393 bp downstream untranslated region); d) pFAdV-9GFP (EGFP expression cassette replacing the right end 3.6 kb) and e) pFAdV-9Dual (both mCherry in the left end and the EGFP expression cassette in the right end of our vector). Our novel FAdV-9 dual-site vaccine vector, produced infectious virus and expressed either one or both mCherry and EGFP.

AB Malaria is an infectious disease having a large negative impact on economic growth. Vaccines are considered as a novel strategy to reduce the burden of malaria. Malaria parasite has a complex life cycle and attempts are being made to develop vaccines that target each stage of the life cycle. Oral vaccines seem to be more feasible to implement in poor countries, since they are relatively inexpensive, needle-free administrated, mostly stable at non-refrigerated conditions and painless. By using recombinant technology, suitable oral hosts could serve as antigen delivering vehicles in developing oral vaccines. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii offers beneficial attributes as oral recombinant protein expression platform. Moreover, C. reinhardtii chloroplast is an attractive platform for expressing malaria antigens because it is capable of folding complex proteins, including those requiring disulfide bond formation, while lacking the ability to glycosylate proteins; a valuable quality of any malaria protein expression system, since the Plasmodium parasite lacks N-linked glycosylation machinery. As a first step towards developing an oral vaccine candidate against malaria, here, we expressed a fusion protein consisting of PfCelTOS, a candidate for pre-erythrocytic and transmission-blocking vaccines, fused to human interleukin-2 (IL2) as vaccine adjuvant in the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii. The effect of light and media on recombinant protein production and cell growth was then studied. Results demonstrated that expressed recombinant proteins accumulate as a soluble, properly folded and functional protein within algal chloroplasts. Moreover, results showed that the highest cell density can be achieved using mixotrophy mode. However, protein accumulation appears to be favored by cultivating in TAP medium in low light.

AB Low cost vaccines against cysticercosis are needed to fight this parasitosis, especially in developing countries. Herein polycistron arrangements were designed to accomplish the simultaneous expression of multiple protective antigens from Taenia solium in the plant cell as an attractive biofactory and delivery vehicle of vaccines. Transplastomic plants carrying synthetic polycistrons were able to simultaneously express the KETc1, KETc7, KETc12, GK1, and TSOL18/HP6-Tsol antigens; which retained their antigenicity and ability to induce humoral responses in BALB/c mice. These clones may be useful for the production of low-cost cysticercosis vaccine prototypes.

AB The application of biocalorimetry to fermentation processes offers advantageous insights, while being less complex compared to other, sophisticated PAT solutions. Although the general concept is established, calorimetric methods vary in detail. In this work, a special approach, called heat compensation calorimetry, was applied to an E. coli fed-batch process. Much work has been done for batch processes, proving the validity and accuracy of this calorimetric mode. However, the adaption of this strategy to fed-batch processes has some implications. In the first section of this work, batch fermentations were performed, comparing heat capacity calorimetry to the compensation mode. Both processes showed very good agreement by means of growth behavior. The heat related differences, e.g. temperature profiles, were obvious. In addition, the impact of the chosen mode on the calculation of in-process heat transfer coefficients was shown. Finally, a fed-batch fermentation was performed. The compensation mode was kept sufficiently, up to the point where the metabolic heat production accelerated strongly. Controller tuning was a neuralgic point, which would have needed further optimization under these conditions. Nevertheless, in the present work it was possible to realize a working compensation process while demonstrating critical aspects that must be considered when establishing such approach.

AB Carbon dioxide emitted from fossil fuel burning processes is quantitatively the most contributor to global warming. It is believed that climate change could be mitigated by means of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). CO2 physical adsorption separation has the potential of capture carbon dioxide with minimum energy costs. A special type of metal organic frameworks named Mg-MOF-74 is an exceptional adsorbent amongst other porous materials with high CO2 uptake at flue gas conditions. Temperature swing adsorption (TSA) composed of 4 steps (feed, rinse, heating, and cooling), for separating CO2 from CO2/N-2 mixture using Mg-MOF-74; has been mathematically modeled. A computer model implementation was developed employing User-Defined-Functions linked to Ansys-Fluent software. The CFD two- and three-dimensional models have been validated against adsorption breakthrough experimental data obtained by the authors, at ambient temperature, and against published experimental data for high temperature conditions.
   The regeneration (heating and cooling) time has been tuned to explore the performance improvement for the TSA process. The TSA optimal key performance indices in terms of CO2 purity, recovery, productivity, and process power consumption have been found to be 96.22%, 86.5%, 0.279 kg of CO2 per hour per kg of Mg-MOF-74, and 663.8 kWh per ton of CO2 captured, respectively. These productivity and power consumption values showed a substantial enhancement in the CO2 adsorption separation compared to those reported in the literature, especially when the heating process is used for the desorption part of the process.

AB Thermal management system requires robust design as well as suitable paraffin/expanded graphite composites for confining the temperature of heat source within safe limits. However, paraffin/expanded graphite composites provide thermal management only for a certain period of time i.e. until the attainment of saturation energy storage limit. Herein, design, fabrication and simulation of a compact paraffin based thermal management system equipped with thermal bridge are presented. By keeping the highest safe temperature limit of batteries i.e. 65 degrees C and phase transition of paraffin as the test standards, performance of heat source was evaluated in terms of its total temperature retardation time along with quantitative effect of paraffin/expanded graphite composite. In the light of fundamental theories on mass and energy balance, substantial design steps and certain empirical equations have been introduced with further validation through experimental analysis. With heat dissipation rate of 6 W, it has been found that 75 g paraffin/expanded graphite composite with melting temperature of 54 degrees C kept the heat source temperature under the highest safe limit for around 13,000 s, providing the longest temperature retardation time in comparison to other types of paraffin/expanded graphite composites. Further, differential scanning calorimeter depicted that latent heat of 5 wt% paraffin/expanded graphite composite was slightly reduced from 182 J/g to 174 J/g even after 400 accelerated thermal cycles, demonstrating the promising thermal reliability and long life, which fits well with the set criterion of overall life expectancy of batteries. Besides, finite element analysis conducted via computational fluid dynamics software Fluent established qualitatively reliable fitness with experimental results.

AB The optimum concentration of dissolved carbon in the microalgal culture medium is a vital requirement for enhanced biomass production. The present study investigates the effect of supplying NaHCO3 with CO2 as the inorganic carbon source to enhance the utilization efficiency of CO2 for maximum FAME productivity of Chlorella sp. HS2. The specific growth rate (0.615 d(-1)), biomass productivity (530.1 mg L-1 d(-1)), CO2 biofixation rate (996.4 mg L-1 d(-1)), FAME productivity (141.8 mg L-1 d(-1)) and FAME content (26.76%) were found to be maximized at NaHCO3 concentration of 0.5 g L-1 with 1% (v/v) CO2 enriched air (0.25 vvm flow rate) supplementation in shake flask condition. The FAME productivity (169.37 mg L-1 d-1) and FAME content (31.2%) were 1.19 and 1.16 times higher respectively in the flat panel photobioreactor than in shake flask condition. Fatty acid profile and biofuel properties show suitability for biodiesel production. The economic assessment revealed that combining supplementation of both carbon sources greatly reduces the carbon supply costs, from $8.92 Kg(-1) when only NaHCO3 was used as the carbon source down to $0.86 Kg(-1) when 1% CO2 was supplied alongside NaHCO3. These findings show that combined application of NaHCO3 and CO2 is the more cost-effective approach of supplying carbon source to microalgae for FAME production.

AB Cost analyses and advanced exergoeconomic analyses are applied to a cascading power cycle with liquefied natural gas regasification. These analyses provide information about the causes of irreversibilities and determine the amount of avoidable irreversibility of the process. The results show that in all components except one of the gas turbines, most of the irreversibility is due to the endogenous exergy destruction. It also indicates that most of the exergy destruction except in combustion chamber is unavoidable, but that there is still a large potential to improve the performance of the system. In terms of avoidable endogenous exergy destruction cost rate, the analysis indicates that combustion chamber and one of the gas turbines should be modified first, because their avoidable endogenous exergy destruction cost rates are higher than those of other components. The cost of exergy destruction and investment in most of the process components are endogenous. So interactions among the components in these processes are not strong. The investment costs of the heat exchangers, one of the compressors, gas turbines and pumps are unavoidable due to technological and economic limits while other process equipment have potentials for improvement. Also based on the avoidable endogenous/exogenous part, three strategies are suggested to improve the performance of the components by reducing exergy destruction costs in the process components. The exergy efficiency and total exergy destruction rate of the process are about 59.4% and 159,600 kW, respectively.

AB Hydraulic performance of a district heating system is a significant aspect in designing. In the context of multiple heat sources and looped topology layout, severe non-linear hydraulic characteristics have markedly impacts on the hydraulic performance design of a district heating network. Design or select variable-speed circulating pumps with suitable capacities and hydraulic characteristics can be a rather difficult issue especially when there are fluctuating renewable heat sources. In this paper, an optimization model is proposed to achieve the lowest power consumption of all pumps and still fulfill the hydraulic head demands of all substations simultaneously. Based on the proposed model, a holistic design method is presented for optimal hydraulic design of the variable speed pumps in each heat source. Then a case study is illustrated to validate the proposed method. With consideration of fluctuating heat load of a renewable heat source, the optimal rated capacities of all pumps and variable speed hydraulic characteristic curves are obtained in the designed heating schemes from 100% to 40% of full heat load. Moreover, when all pumps operating on their optimal regime, there always exists one substation branch whose excess head would reach the preset minimum value. The sensitivity analysis results show that the variation of total work of pumps can be from 0.16% to 7.56% when the heat load of the renewable heat source fluctuated 1.0% in different designed heating schemes.

AB Post-refining of crude biomass liquefaction-derived polyols (biopolyols) to remove undesired carbonyl compounds is essential to improve the quality of biopolymers. One of the dominated carbonyl compounds in the crude biopolyols, butyl levulinate (BL), was hydrogenated to gamma-valerolactone (GVL) over Cu-modified NiCoB amorphous alloy catalyst to explore a high-efficient hydrogenation upgrading catalyst. Cu0.5Ni1Co1B catalyst with metallic Cu particle size of 10.2 nm and the highest BL conversion of 74.6% was supported on the acid activated attapulgite (H+-ATP) material. The synergistic effect between acidic and hydrogenated active centers in Cu0.5Ni1Co1B/H+-ATP catalyst was proved by NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) to promote the conversion of carbonyl compounds compared to unsupported Cu0.5Ni1Co1B catalyst. Reaction temperature also showed a positive effect on the removal of carbonyl compounds especially for the acids and their esters. Under the optimum reaction conditions (140 degrees C, 1.0 MPa), the relative content of carbonyl compounds in crude biopolyols showed an obvious decrease of 10.3%, while the hydroxyl number of biopolyols increased by 140 mg KOH/g. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis results indicated that the conversion of ethylene glycol condensation products and their monoesters or diesters of acetic acid and propionic acid was the major reaction during the process of hydrogenation upgrading of crude biopolyols. Cu0.5Ni1Co1B/H+-ATP catalyst also exhibited well stability for the aqueous-phase hydrogenation of crude biopolyols without deactivation in five times run.

AB Geyser boiling is a complex phenomenon which may occur in heat pipes causing high temperature and pressure oscillation leading to noticeable vibration. Therefore, understanding of such process is essential to improve heat pipes thermal performance and avoid damage. In this experimental study, a comprehensive investigation of several parameters on the characteristics of the geyser boiling has been conducted during the operation of two-phase closed thermosiphon (TPCT) using water as the working fluid. The effect of different inclination angles (90, 60, 30 and 10 degrees) at various fill ratios defined as volume of liquid in the evaporator to the volume of the evaporator (25%, 65% and 100%) on the geyser boiling has been investigated at a broad range of heat load and for various mass flow rates and inlet temperatures of the cooling water. These important parameters have been examined to report the occurrence and period of the geyser effect at each heat input. The results showed that the orientation and the liquid charge have a significant impact on the occurrence and period of the geyser boiling at low and high heat inputs. For example, at a fill ratio of 100%, the geyser boiling occurs at a lower heat input compared with that for fill ratios 25%, 65% at all inclination angles, while it happens at a higher heat load at a low inclination 10 degrees compared with other angles at all fill ratios. In addition, at high input energies, it almost disappears at orientations of 90 and 60 degrees for all liquid charges. Also, comparing with fill ratios of 25% and 65%, a shorter period is observed for a fill ratio of 100% at angles of 90, 30 and 10 degrees, whereas it is longer at 60 degrees and low heat inputs. This work highlights the effects of the operating conditions on geyser boiling in heat pipes.

AB A fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FCHEV) is more advantageous compared to a gasoline-powered internal combustion engine based vehicle or a traditional hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) because a FCHEV only uses one electric motor instead of an internal combustion engine or an electric motor in combination with an internal combustion engine. This study proposes a novel fuel cell (FC)/supercapacitor (SC) hybrid power source to be utilized in FCHEVs. The power source includes a 90 kW proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack used as the main power source, and a 600 F SC bank used as the auxiliary energy storage device. A prototype of the FC/SC hybrid power source has been constructed, and experimental verifications are presented that explicitly substantiate having a power efficiency of 96.2% around the rated power, highly accurate DC-link voltage regulation and producing an appropriate three-phase stator current supplied to the traction motor by using PWM technique are the main contributions of this work. Providing a maximum speed of 158 km/h, 0-100 km/h acceleration in 12.2 s and a cruising range of 435 km for a FCHEV with the weight of 1880 kg are the other advantages. The proposed FC/SC hybrid power source is also compared to the state of the art of all kinds of power sources used in FCHEVs that clearly demonstrates its better performances such as higher power efficiency, speed and acceleration.

AB Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants that are also capable of CO2 capture have received significant attention as the next generation of coal-based power plants for the co-production of H-2 and electrical power. Accordingly, for a cost-effective and environmentally friendly poly-generation IGCC process, efficient techniques need to be developed to recover H-2 from the syngas of an IGCC plant with carbon capture.
   In this study, an eight-layered bed pressure swing adsorption (PSA) process using activated carbon and zeolite simultaneously was developed to produce high purity H-2 from the H-2-rich syngas of an IGCC plant. As a first step, the separation performance was compared between four-and eight-layered bed PSA processes. The eight layered bed PSA process led to higher recovery of H-2 at the condition of a similar H-2 purity owing to a greater number of pressure equalization steps in the operational step configuration. It is noteworthy that the productivity could be greatly improved as the purge gas was replaced from the product gas to residual gas in a bed. When the adsorption bed was purged by using the residual gas after the first pressure equalization step, recovery improved by about 3 similar to 6 % at the condition of 99.99 + mol% H-2 purity in comparison with the product-purge PSA configuration. On the other hand, the highest H-2 recovery that could be obtained for the requirement of 99.99 mol% H-2 purity, was similar to 89.7 % from the eight-layered bed H-2 PSA process when the purge gas was provided from the residual gas of the adsorption bed after the last depressurization pressure equalization step. However, as the concentration of CO in the desired H-2 product was higher in the PSA configuration when using residual gas compared to the product gas, the operational configuration of PSA needed to be decided by the desired H-2 purity and impurity constraints for application. Furthermore, the tail gas from the PSA contained 45-66 mol% of H-2 and CO, depending on the applied PSA configurations, and could be used to drive a gas turbine without any loss of the syngas, even though the recompression energy loss required evaluation.

AB Alternative fuels have been a major concern in today's era due to its promising characteristics in internal combustion engines. The computational analysis is a proven method by many researchers in determining combustion, performance and emission characteristics of an internal combustion engine, offering accurate results at par with experimental results. An attempt is being made by the author(s) in this paper for performing numerical study of nine (9) different alternative biofuels and pure diesel. Comparison has been carried out with the results of pure diesel in a single cylinder, naturally aspirated, water cooled, direct injection diesel engine with different engine load (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%), constant compression ratio (CR17.5), higher nozzle opening pressure (220 bar) and advance injection timing (23 degrees CA before TDC). The study was performed after validating results of two experimental data using the proposed tool, which have shown that the numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental results. The numerical results of the different biofuels have depicted the possibility of using the fuels as alternative fuel for internal combustion engine.

AB This research aims mainly at further investigate technical options to reduce the cost of electric power production from concentrating solar power plants in hot arid regions. The work also aims to minimize water consumption due to its scarcity in such regions by means of investigating the utilization of dry cooling option. However, dry cooling system increases the parasitic power consumption of the power plant and this is bound to reduce the overall system efficiency. In arid regions, this loss in efficiency is compensated by the abundance of solar radiation that results in a better solar field efficiency. Furthermore, this study investigates the effect of using alternative heat transfer fluid in the solar circuit instead of synthetic oil. For this purpose, an optimization of a solar parabolic trough power plant coupled with dry cooling system has been performed using the simulation software "SAM". The optimization is carried out by varying the solar field size, the thermal energy storage system, the size of the power block (steam turbine) and the type of the heat transfer fluid. This was done in order to find out the best combination that gives lowest power production cost. The power plant was simulated in two steps with different combinations; while "Therminol VP I" was used in the first step, as heat transfer fluid, in the second step, "Therminol VPI" was replaced by "Molten Salt". The obtained results prove that plants with large solar fields (solar multiple of 2) and large thermal energy storage systems (7.5 full load hours) perform better and can generate power at lower costs compared with smaller plants. The investigation of alternative heat transfer fluid shows that molten salt is more cost effective than synthetic oil in parabolic trough power plants. The obtained Levelized Cost Of Electricity of the best power plant optimized configuration is 17.24 c(sic)/kWh(e) and 13.8 c(sic)/kWh(e), for plants with "Therminol VP I" and "Molten Salt" as heat transfer fluid, respectively. The optimization results with "Molten Salt" as heat transfer fluid show excellent results regarding the dry cooled solar power plants. This show good technical and economic potentials in future designs.

AB The present study aims to maximize the conversion of microalgae oil to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) using supercritical methanol (SCM) transesterification by sequential hybrid optimization using response surface methodology (RSM), artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA). The three process parameters selected for the optimization of SCM transesterification were temperature (240 to 300 degrees C), time (15 to 45 min) and MeOH: oil molar ratio (15:1 to 45:1). Initial experiments performed according to the central composite design (CCD) generated matrix of RSM and further validated by ANN. The H-1-NMR analysis confirms the formation of methyl esters. Moreover, the corresponding regression coefficient (R-2) for the model were 0.97 and 0.99 for RSM and ANN, respectively indicated excellent fit of the model to the experimental data. Furthermore, the final optimized condition for FAME conversion efficiency of RSM and ANN predicted models were 98.01% and 98.15%, respectively. The fitness function for GA was obtained from ANN predicted model equations and presented as globally optimized (GA conditions) reaction conditions for SCM: temp - 285.21 degrees C, time - 26.57 min and MeOH: oil molar ratio - 23.47. The predicted percent conversion efficiency of GA optimized conditions was 99.16% whereas, the experimental optimum FAME conversion reached to 98.12%. Additionally, the gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GCMS) analysis revealed the presence of palmitic (28%), oleic (33%), linoleic (8%) and other saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The other biodiesel properties such as acid value, iodine value, cetane number, calorific value, etc. were also analyzed and exhibited an analogous trend with standard ASTM D6571 standards.

AB The accuracy of CFD simulations of vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) is known to be significantly associated with the computational parameters, such as azimuthal increment, domain size and number of turbine revolutions before reaching a statistically steady state condition (convergence). A detailed review of the literature, however, indicates that there is a lack of extensive parametric studies investigating the impact of the computational parameters. The current study, therefore, intends to systematically investigate the impact of these parameters, on the simulation results to guide the execution of accurate CFD simulations of VAWTs at different tip speed ratios (lambda) and solidities (sigma). The evaluation is based on 110 CFD simulations validated with wind tunnel measurements for two VAWTs. Instantaneous moment coefficient, C-m, and power coefficient, C-p, are studied for each case using unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations with the 4-equation transition SST turbulence model. The results show that the azimuthal increment d theta is largely dependent on tip speed ratio. For moderate to high lambda, the minimum requirement for d theta is 0.5 degrees while this decreases to 0.1 degrees at low to moderate lambda. The need for finer time steps is associated to the flow complexities related to dynamic stall on turbine blades and blade-wake interactions at low lambda. In addition, the minimum distance from the turbine center to the domain inlet and outlet is 15 and 10 times the turbine diameter, respectively. It is also shown that 20-30 turbine revolutions are required to ensure statistically converged solutions. The current findings can serve as guidelines towards accurate and reliable CFD simulations of VAWTs at different tip speed ratios and solidities.

AB A polymer-based flexible pulsating heat pipe (FPHP) as a flexible heat spreader was developed, and a series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the thermal performance and the long-term reliability of the FPHP. The FPHP consisted of a multilayer laminated film and a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) sheet. HFE-7000 was used as the working fluid, and the width, length, and thickness of the FPHP were 53.4 mm, 85.5 mm, and 1 mm, respectively. To minimize the permeation of non-condensable gases (NCGs) in a lateral direction, the heat-sealed flanges were covered with the indium coating. Owing to the indium-coated flanges, the long-term reliability of the FPHP drastically increased. The lifetime of the FPHP was defined to evaluate the long-term reliability. The FPHP had a lifetime of 18.2 days in the acceleration test environment, which was equivalent to 306 days in a standard atmosphere and 17 times longer than the previous polymer-based PHP. The FPHP had the thermal resistance of 2.41 K/W, which is 37% lower than that of the copper reference sample in a vertical orientation. Under bending conditions as well as in a horizontal orientation, the FPHP still operated well as a PHP, but the thermal resistance increased slightly. The fabrication method of the FPHP is effective in minimizing the permeation of NCGs in a lateral direction and can pave the way for fabricating a thin flexible heat spreader that has high flexibility, high thermal performance, and long-term reliability.

AB In this paper the experimental testing of a cascade chiller composed of an adsorption unit and a vapour compression unit is reported. The operation of the cascade under realistic operating conditions, differing for the temperature of the heat source available and the environmental temperature is analysed. A comparison was made between the application of the cascade and a vapour compression chiller only for air conditioning applications. According to the heat source temperatures, an increase in the electric COP of the system ranging from 25% to 50% was measured, with a maximum value of 8. An optimization of the system was subsequently proposed, by evaluating different adsorbent materials and refrigerants through the use of thermodynamic models. The theoretical study revealed that a performance up to 110% higher with respect to traditional chillers could be obtained if the cascade was used in refrigeration applications.

AB The use of nanofluids in parabolic trough collectors is a promising technique for enhancing their performance. This study investigates the dispersion of CuO nanoparticles in Syltherm 800 (thermal oil) and in nitrate molten salt (60% NaNO3 - 40% KNO3). The objective of this work is to examine the thermal efficiency enhancement margin of the utilization of nanofluids for two usual working fluids (thermal oil and molten salt) as base fluids. Moreover, this work includes hydraulic analysis about the pressure losses and exergetic analysis in order to evaluate the total performance of the collector. The module of LS-2 parabolic trough collector is examined with a computational fluid dynamics program developed in SolidWorks Flow Simulation. The model accuracy is checked with thermal efficiency and flow criteria using literature results. The simulations are conducted for temperatures up to 650 K for oil cases and up to 850 K for molten salt cases. According to the final results, the use of oil-based nanofluids leads to thermal efficiency enhancement up to 0.76%, while the use of molten salt-based nanofluid up to 0.26% thermal efficiency enhancement. The Nusselt number enhancement is found up to 40% for Syltherm 800-CuO and up to 13% for molten salt-CuO.

AB The objective of this work is to present a hybrid Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) driven by solar energy and waste heat. Parabolic trough collectors coupled to a storage tank feed the heat recovery system which also utilizes waste heat of low-grade temperature (150 degrees C - 300 degrees C). Four different working fluids (toluene, cyclohexane, MDM and n-pentane) are examined in the regenerative ORC. The system is designed properly in order the maximum electricity production to be produced with the highest possible exploitation of the waste heat source. The examined model is investigated under steady-state conditions with a developed thermodynamic model in EES (Engineering Equation Solver). According to the final results, toluene leads to the highest electricity production, with cyclohexane, MDM and n-pentane to follow. The electricity production with toluene is found to be ranged from 479 kW to 845 kW and the system efficiency from 11.6% to 19.7%, with waste heat source temperature variation from 150 degrees C to 300 degrees C respectively. Moreover, it is found that higher waste heat source temperature leads to a higher fraction of the waste heat input in the ORC for all the working fluids.

AB Solar photovoltaic plants are widely integrated into most countries worldwide. Due to the ever-growing utilization of solar photovoltaic plants, either via grid-connection or stand-alone networks, dramatic changes can be anticipated in both power system planning and operating stages. Solar photovoltaic integration requires the capability of handling the uncertainty and fluctuations of power output. In this case, solar photovoltaic power forecasting is a crucial aspect to ensure optimum planning and modelling of the solar photovoltaic plants. Accurate forecasting provides the grid operators and power system designers with significant information to design an optimal solar photovoltaic plant as well as managing the power of demand and supply. This paper presents an extensive review on recent advancements in the field of solar photovoltaic power forecasting. This paper aims to analyze and compare various methods of solar photovoltaic power forecasting in terms of characteristics and performance. This work classifies solar photovoltaic power forecasting methods into three major categories i.e., time-series statistical methods, physical methods, and ensemble methods. To date, Artificial Intelligence approaches are widely used due to their capability in solving the non-linear and complex structure of data. The performance analysis shows that these methods outperform the traditional methods. Recently, the ensemble methods were also developed by researchers to extract the unique features of single models to enhance the forecast model performances. This combination produces accurate results compared to individual models. This paper also elaborates on the metrics assessment which was implemented to evaluate the forecast model performances. This work provides information which is beneficial for researchers and engineers who are involved in the modelling and planning of the solar photovoltaic plant.

AB The wind speed forecasting plays an important role in the planning, controlling and monitoring of the intelligent wind power systems. Since the wind speed signal is stochastic and intermittent, it is difficult to achieve their satisfactory prediction. In the study, a novel hybrid deep-learning wind speed prediction model, which combines the empirical wavelet transformation and two kinds of recurrent neural network, is proposed. In the proposed new model, the empirical wavelet transformation is adopted to decompose the raw wind speed data into several sub-layers. The long short term memory neural network, a deep learning algorithm based method, is utilized to predict the low-frequency wind speed sub-layers. The Elman neural network, a mainstream recurrent neural network, is built to predict the high-frequency sub-layers. In the executed forecasting experiments, eleven different forecasting models are included to validate the real prediction performance of the proposed model. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model has satisfactory performance in the high-precision wind speed prediction.

AB Wind power is one of the most promising powers. Wind speed forecasting can eliminate the harmful effect caused by the intermittent and fluctuation of wind power, and big multi-step forecasting can provide more time for the power grid to be adjusted. To achieve the high-precision big multi-step forecasting, a novel hybrid model named as the WD-SampEn-VMD-MadaBoost-BEGS-WF is proposed in the study, which consisting of three main modeling steps including the secondary decomposition, the ensemble method and the error correction. The detail of the proposed model is given as follows: (a) wind speed series are decomposed by the WD (Wavelet Decomposition) to obtain wind speed subseries. The SampEn (Sample Entropy) algorithm is used to estimate the unpredictability of these wind speed subseries. The most unpredictable subseries will be decomposed secondarily by the VMD (Variational Mode Decomposition); (b) the subseries are proceeded by the MAdaBoost (Modified AdaBoost.RT) with the BFGS (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno Quasi-Newton Back Propagation) neuron network to obtain forecasting subseries; (c) all of the forecasting subseries will be combined with the original subseries to form the combined wind speed series, which will be further proceeded by the WF (Wavelet Filter) to obtain the corrected forecasting series from the point of the frequency domain; (d) the corrected forecasting series are reconstructed to get the final forecasting series. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, several forecasting cases are provided in the study. The result indicates that the proposed model has satisfactory forecasting performance in the big multi-step extremely strong simulating wind speed forecasting.

DE Thermal optimization; Natural convection; Radial plate-fin heat sink
AB In this study, horizontally oriented radial plate-fin heat sinks in natural convection are optimized analytically and experimentally. The thermal resistance is selected as an objective function under the constraint of a given base-to-ambient temperature difference. For thermal optimization, a new correlation of the heat transfer coefficient for the radial plate-fin heat sinks is developed using the asymptotic method and validated experimentally. While the existing correlation has a limited applicable range, the newly developed correlation covers complete ranges of the three design parameters for a fin geometry: fin thickness (t), fin length (L), and number of fins (n(fin)). Using this new correlation, the thermal performance of a radial plate-fin heat sink is optimized with respect to these three design parameters. Finally, optimum fin geometries for applications with various sizes are obtained, since the newly suggested correlation is applicable to various physical sizes which are characterized by the base diameter (D) and the fin height (H).

AB Comfortable, efficient and affordable heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in buildings are highly desirable to achieve zero energy building effort. Traditional vapor compression air-conditioners hold a lower COP (coefficient-of-performance) (typically 3.2-3.8) because it often operates at a lower evaporation temperature (5-7 degrees C) and a higher condensing temperature (50-55 degrees C) caused by cooling-based dehumidification that handles both sensible and latent load together. Room temperature and humidity independent control or desiccant systems have been proposed to overcome these challenges, however, the COP of current desiccant systems is quite small and additional heat sources are usually used. In this paper, a desiccant-enhanced direct expansion heat pump (DDX HP) based on water-sorbing heat exchangers was reported, with an ultrahigh COP value of more than 6 without sacrificing any comfort and compactness. The efficiency is double in comparison with today normal room air conditioners, which is a breath-taking and revolutionary progress in HVAC industry. This new approach opens up the possibility of designing a zero energy building with DDX HP powered by solar PV, and the simulation results show that one PV model (265Wp) can effectively handle about 10 m(2) cooling load in Shanghai in summer.

AB The performance of an original two-step reaction system (pyrolysis and in-line reforming) was assessed in the hydrogen production from different plastics (polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate and polystyrene) and their mixture. The pyrolysis step was performed in a conical spouted bed reactor at 500 degrees C, whereas the reforming of pyrolysis volatiles was carried out in a fluidized bed reactor at 700 degrees C. This two in-line reactor configuration was initially developed for the reforming of high density polyethylene pyrolysis volatiles, and this paper describes the influence composition of pyrolysis products derived from different plastics has on the reforming step, conversion, product yields and deactivation behavior. The products formed in both the pyrolysis and the reforming steps were analysed by on-line gas chromatography and micro-gas chromatography. Significant differences in the reforming behaviour of the plastics were observed, with hydrogen productions being higher in the case of polyolefins (from 34.8 to 37.3 wt%) followed by polystyrene (29.1 wt%) and remarkably lower for polyethylene terephthalate (18.2 wt%). Furthermore, the evolution of conversion and product distribution with time on stream was assessed for the different plastics studied and the catalyst deactivation rate was related to the amount and morphology of the coke deposited on the reforming catalyst. It was proven that the features of the reactors used in the pyrolysis and reforming steps are suitable for minimizing operational problems, and therefore operating in continuous regime.

AB The use of binary zeotropic mixtures as working fluids applied to Organic Rankine Cycles (ORCs) is investigated in this paper. In total, six (6) hydrocarbons and (2) hydrofluorocarbons are considered, leading to twenty-eight (28) possible binary combinations. The mixtures were tested with a basic Rankine cycle while using the heat source temperature as independent variable, which assumed six different values, ranging from 80 degrees C to 180 degrees C, in steps of 20 degrees C. The simulations aimed to identify the ideal mixtures that maximized the net power and exergetic efficiency, and minimized the heat exchanger's global conductance for a given temperature of the heat source. The optimization process relied on a genetic algorithm and the selection of the best mixtures, on a non-dominated sorting method (NDS), which returned Pareto fronts gathering the best solutions. While no one specific ideal mixture was identified, the results showed that the range of the so-called ideal mixtures narrows as the heat source temperature increases, with mixtures including fluids like R245fa and pentane being good options, whereas at low temperature, a larger number of fluid mixtures perform well. Finally, a scale analysis is proposed and shows that the maximal net power varies linearly with a Number of Transfer Units (NTU) factor while its slope depends on the heat source temperature. The latter analysis is compared with the results obtained with the Pareto front and NDS, showing that both sets of results agree well while correlated by a single constant for the entire temperature range covered in the present study.

AB In the present study, two single (T1 and T2) and eight combined (C1-C8) sunshine-based empirical models for estimating daily horizontal global solar radiation were compared, and four new combined sunshine-based models (P1-P4) were developed. The accuracy and applicability of these models were further evaluated in South China with humid subtropical and tropical climates influenced by the Asian monsoon as a case study. For this purpose, daily meteorological data during 1966-2000 from 20 radiation stations were used for model calibration and the data from 2001 to 2015 were used to validate the models. These models were evaluated and compared based on coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), mean bias error (MBE) and a global performance index (GPI). The single sunshine-based model T-2 was recommended for R, estimation with acceptable accuracy when using only sunshine duration data. In terms of combined sunshine-based models, the newly proposed model P3 was the optimum model for daily global solar radiation estimation when sunshine duration, air temperature and precipitation were available. The proposed complex model P4 was recommended for estimating daily global solar radiation with an excellent accuracy when vapor pressure deficit and relatively humidity were further available. Generally, the proposed combined models based on sunshine duration can be applied for daily global solar radiation estimation with high accuracy in humid regions of China and maybe elsewhere with similar climate.

AB The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is regarded as one of the most promising methods to increase the efficiency of diesel engines. Owing to the variability of exhaust energy with engine speed and load, the ORC should be designed for various operating conditions of engines for optimal waste heat recovery (WHR). In this study, an integrated simulation model of the diesel engine-ORC combined system (the combined system) is built by GT-Suite. Based on the model, the MAPs of optimum parameters are obtained by an artificial neural network (ANN) and a genetic algorithm (GA). Subsequently, operation modes of the combined system under various conditions are proposed. Finally, a control strategy of switching operation modes and adjusting parameters that adapts to various conditions of diesel engines is developed by GT-Suite and MATLAB/Simulink. Simulation results show that the optimum pump speed is steady approximately 1000 r/min under the low load region of the engine and increases with the engine load when the engine speed is higher than 1800 r/min. By contrast, the optimum expander speed is 1500 r/min in all selected engine operating conditions. Further investigations indicate that the performance of the combined system presents improvements, with a 3.57% increase in thermal efficiency and a 10.09 g/(kW.h) reduction in brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) when compared against the original diesel engine. These preliminary results prove that the integrated simulation model can be used for further research. Meanwhile, with regard to the proposed control strategy, more thorough experimental research needs to be conducted.

AB The coupled radiative transfer and thermal energy equations were numerically solved for a nanofluid-based, direct absorption solar collector (DASC) using a Rayleigh scattering approximation for the optical properties of the nanofluid. The flow field was solved using a vorticity-stream function formulation. The numerical model was validated against published results in the literature. The effects of collector aspect ratio, incident radiative flux, heat loss coefficient, inlet flow velocity, nanoparticle size, and nanoparticle concentration were determined for four different types of nanoparticles. It was established that the impact of these parameters on collector performance was determined by the extent to which they affected the outlet temperature gain and thermal losses to the ambiance. Through the exact solution of the flow field, it was established that performance deviations from the fully-developed assumption were encountered for small collector aspect ratios, especially with high Reynolds numbers (Re > 1500). Moreover, with the exception of cases with very low Reynolds numbers (Re < 40), assuming a plug flow profile throughout the collector was shown to cause performance overestimations. Sensitivity of DASC performance to the type of incident radiation spectrum was also investigated and it was found to be largely dependent on spectral distribution of the extinction coefficient of the nanoparticle. The common assumption of a blackbody incident spectrum results in performance overestimations for certain types of nanoparticle suspensions (e.g., silver) more than others (e.g., graphite). Using a higher nanoparticle volume fraction causes the efficiency of the collector to be more insensitive to the incident spectrum type. For a given nanofluid material and thickness, it was established that an optimum nanoparticles concentration existed.

AB Life prediction is a significant and difficult topic for a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell stack, especially a commercial fuel cell stack. This paper proposes a reconstructed fuel cell life-prediction model to estimate the fuel cell lifetime adopted in a city bus. Considering the temperature fluctuation and sensor errors, the voltage model is separated into three parts to simplify the fitting process, and the validation results show that the proposed degradation model is credible and robust. Furthermore, the 14-day training data show that the deviation of the predicted voltage is less than 1%. In this study, the most important innovation is separating the time into different categories. Compared to the traditional method without classification, the proposed model obtains an improved predicted deviation of 50-100%.

AB This work presents the results of construction and testing of a flat plate thermal solar collector with an absorber section that has enhanced radiative properties through the modification of its surface properties. A copper oxide layer is grown on top of the copper absorber by chemically treating it in an ammonia atmosphere. Then, a novel graphene mechanical deposition technique is employed that uses compressed air to deposit few layer graphene on top of the copper oxide substrate. In total, three absorbers are made, one features the copper oxide layer, the second has graphene on top of copper oxide and the third is the reference absorber covered with a black matt paint. The radiative properties of the absorbers are assessed, as well as their thermal efficiencies. The best performance was recorded for the graphene-clad copper oxide collector, with a maximum efficiency of 69.4% compared with an efficiency of around 39.5% for the reference collector.

AB Vitamin D has been established as a key factor in the development of obesity through the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of the VDR gene to obesity-related phenotypes in a population of Caucasian young adults. The study population consisted of 701 healthy Spanish young adults (mean age 20.41 +/- 2.48). Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of VDR (TaqI, BsmI and FokI) were selected as genetic markers. Body composition measurements including weight, body mass index (BMI), fat mass (FM), percentage of fat mass (PFM), fat-free mass (FFM) and visceral fat level (VFL) were analysed. Differences in obesity traits across the genotypes were determined using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The FokI polymorphism showed a significant association with PFM across the whole population after adjusting for age and sex (p = 0.022). Age-adjusted analysis revealed an association between body weight and the TaqI and BsmI SNPs in males (p = 0.033 and p = 0.028, respectively). However, these positive findings did not remain significant after applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Our findings suggest that VDR genetic variants are unlikely to play a major role in obesity-related phenotypes in a population of Caucasian young adults.

AB Carbonic anhydrase VI (CA VI) has been characterized as a secretory isozyme in mammals. Our present study confirmed the occurrence of CA VI in pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes). In this study, genomic sequence information for the CA VI of pufferfish was used for molecular cloning. We cloned a 1821 bp cDNA sequence, which consisted of a complete coding sequence of 1623 bp and a deduced amino acid sequence of 540 amino acids from the open reading frame. A BLAST search indicated that this protein exhibits 53%, 79%, and 67% identity with human, tilapia, and gar CA VI, respectively. It also shows 63%-77% identity with other fish CA VI-like sequences (zebrafish, Asian arowana, salmon, and large yellow croaker). Moreover, alignment of two or more sequences revealed that the protein sequence of pufferfish CA VI has 34%-37% identity with mammalian and fish CA II sequences. An NH2-terminal signal peptide of 18 amino acids in length was predicted in the pufferfish CA VI sequence. Three potential N-linked glycosylation sites and two cysteine residues (Cys-28 and Cys-209) that are likely to form one disulfide bond were present in pufferfish CA VI. In silica and phylogenetic analyses revealed that pufferfish CA VI is an extracellular secretory protein. Active site analysis indicated that this protein is a low activity CA isozymes due to a characteristic Val/Ile substitution at position 207. Homology modeling of puffer CA VI was performed using the crystal structure of human carbonic anhydrase XIV as a template structure, based on high similarity. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization results revealed that, the pufferfish CA VI is highly expressed in liver tissue.

AB microRNAs (miRNAs) are nowadays recognized as an essential component of gene regulatory networks. Furthermore, deregulation of miRNAs expression often contributes to human pathologies. Recently, a substantial number of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and rare mutations within pri-, pre- and mature miRNA sequences have been reported. These miRNA SNPs have often been associated with human disease. However, due to the complexity of miRNA biogenesis and the genome-wide functional effects of miRNAs, the determination of biological consequences of these miRNA SNPs remains challenging. Despite an increasing number of reports linking miRNA SNPs with human pathologies, few reports have analyzed the mechanism by which miRNA-SNPs contribute to disease pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss how single polynucleotide polymorphisms in miRNAs genes may influence miRNAs expression and function and thus potentially alter disease pathogenesis.

AB During the past decades, lipid nanocarriers are gaining momentum with their multiple advantages for the management of skin diseases. Lipid nanocarriers enable to target the therapeutic payload to deep skin layers or even to reach the blood circulation making them a promising cutting-edge technology.
   Lipid nanocarriers refer to a large panel of drug delivery systems. Lipid vesicles are the most conventional, known to be able to carry lipophilic and hydrophilic active agents. A variety of lipid vesicles with high flexibility and deformability could be obtained by adjusting their composition; namely ethosomes, transfersomes and penetration enhancer lipid vesicles which achieve the best results in term of skin permeation. Others are designed with the objective to perform higher encapsulation rate and higher stability, such as solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid nanocarriers.
   In this review, we attempted to give an overview of lipid based nanocarriers developed with the aim to enhance dermal and transdermal drug delivery. A special focus is put on the nanocarrier composition, behavior and interaction mechanisms with the skin. Recent applications of lipid-based nanocarriers for the management of skin diseases and other illnesses are highlighted as well.

AB The compliance of patients to solid oral dosage forms is strongly conditioned by the perceived ease of swallowing, especially in geriatric and pediatric populations. This study proposes a method, based on an in vitro model of the human oropharyngeal cavity, to study quantitatively the oral phase of human swallowing in presence of single or multiple tablets. The dynamics of swallowing was investigated varying the size and shape of model tablets and adjusting the force applied to the mechanical setup to simulate tongue pressure variations among individuals. The evolution of the velocity of the bolus, the oral transit time, and the relative position of the solid oral dosage form within the liquid bolus were measured quantitatively from high speed camera recordings. Whenever the solid dosage forms were big enough to interact with the walls of the in vitro oral cavity, a strong effect of the volume of the medication in respect of its swallowing velocity was observed, with elongated tablets flowing faster than spherical tablets. Conversely, the geometrical properties of the solid oral dosage forms did not significantly affect the bolus dynamics when the cross section of the tablet was lower than 40% of that of the bolus. The oral phase of swallowing multiple tablets was also considered in the study by comparing different sizes while maintaining a constant total mass. The predictive power of different theories was also evaluated against the experimental results, providing a mechanistic interpretation of the dynamics of the in vitro oral phase of swallowing. These findings and this approach could pave the way for a better design of solid oral medications to address the special needs of children or patients with swallowing disorders and could help designing more successful sensory evaluations and clinical studies.

AB Heparin-like sulfated polysaccharides are potential drug candidates owing to their ability to interact with angiogenic factors and inhibit angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis. This study aimed to improve the delivery of heparin-like anticancer polysaccharides for accumulation at the tumor site. We designed a nanocarrier system using protamine attached to polyethylene glycol (PEG) and evaluated the stability, tumor targeting, and tumor growth inhibition of the nanocarrier loaded with heparin derivatives. When mixed with various polyanionic heparin derivatives, the polycationic PEG-protamine formed stable self-assembled nanocomplexes via ionic interactions, with flexible PEG chains located on the outside. Among the complexes, a nanocomplex loaded with a low-molecular-weight heparin-suramin conjugate (LHsura) had the most suitable average size (101.9 nm) for the enhanced permeability and retention effect and allowed accumulation of LHsura at the tumor site for up to 48 h. In a tumor-bearing mouse model, the PEG-protamine and LHsura nanocomplex (10 mg/kg/3 days, intravenously), which could be extravasated through the tumor vasculature, significantly inhibited tumor growth, more than LHsura alone did. Overall, the self-assembled nanocomplexation of PEG-protamine and LHsura helped control the release and extravasation of LHsura, which resulted in an antitumor effect on the target tumor cells.

AB Many efforts have been made in the past to understand the function of lactose fines which are given as a ternary component to carrier-based dry powder inhaler formulations. It is undisputed that fines can significantly improve the performance of such formulations, but choosing the right amount of fines is a crucial point, because too high concentrations can have negative effects on the dispersion performance. The aim of this study was to indicate the optimal concentration of fines with a simple test method. For this purpose, mixtures with salbutamol sulfate and two different lactose carriers were prepared with a high shear mixer, measured with a FT4 powder rheometer and tested for fine particle delivery with two different inhaler devices. A correlation between the fluidization energy, measured with the aeration test set up, and the fine particle fractions (FPF) could be proven. This also applied for the aeration ratio, as well as the permeability of the powder samples. In addition, drug-free mixtures hardly differed in their rheological properties from mixtures containing the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), which indicates that the method could be suitable for cost-saving screening trials. Furthermore, important aspects that explain the function of fines, such as the saturation of active sites, the formation of agglomerates and an increase in fluidization energy, could be shown in this study.

AB Over the last few decades, hot melt extrusion (HME) has emerged as a successful technology for a broad spectrum of applications in the pharmaceutical industry. As indicated by multiple publications and patents, HME is mainly used for the enhancement of solubility and bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs. This review is focused on the recent reports on the solubility enhancement via HME and provides an update for the manufacturing/scaling up aspects of melt extrusion. In addition, drug characterization methods and dissolution studies are discussed. The application of process analytical technology (PAT) tools and use of HME as a continuous manufacturing process may shorten the drug development process; as a result, the latter is becoming the most widely utilized technique in the pharmaceutical industry. The advantages, disadvantages, and practical applications of various PAT tools such as near and mid-infrared, ultraviolet/visible, fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopies are summarized, and the characteristics of other techniques are briefly discussed. Overall, this review also provides an outline for the currently marketed products and analyzes the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of HME application in the pharmaceutical industry.

AB Co-amorphous drug delivery systems based on amino acids as co-formers have shown promising potential to improve the solubility and bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs. Potential salt formation is assumed to be a key molecular interaction responsible for amorphous stability and increased solubility. However, little is known about the importance of the overall structure of the co-former. In this study, the structurally related amino acids arginine (basic) and citrulline (neutral) were chosen together with four model drugs (acidic furosemide and nitrofurantoin; basic cimetidine and mebendazole) to investigate the importance of salt formation versus structural similarity of co-formers. Drug-amino acid mixtures were ball milled at a molar ratio of 1:1. Generally, arginine showed a higher tendency to successfully form co-amorphous systems with the model drugs compared with citrulline, irrespective of assumed salt formation. Salt forming mixtures showed much higher T(g)s, faster dissolution rates, higher solubility and physical stability compared to the corresponding non-salt forming mixtures. In conclusion, structural similarity of the co-formers does not lead to similar co-former performance for a given drug. Salt formation is not a prerequisite for the formation of a co-amorphous system, but if a co-amorphous salt system is formed, improved dissolution rate and physical stability are observed.

AB We demonstrate the coating of tablets using an injection molding (IM) process that has advantage of being solvent free and can provide precision coat features. The selected core tablets comprising 10% w/w griseofulvin were prepared by an integrated hot melt extrusion-injection molding (HME-IM) process. Coating trials were conducted on a vertical injection mold machine. Polyethylene glycol and polyethylene oxide based hot melt extruded coat compositions were used. Tablet coating process feasibility was successfully demonstrated using different coating mold designs (with both overlapping and non-overlapping coatings at the weld) and coat thicknesses of 150 and 300 mu m. The resultant coated tablets had acceptable appearance, seal at the weld, and immediate drug release profile (with an acceptable lag time). Since IM is a continuous process, this study opens opportunities to develop HME-IM continuous processes for transforming powder to coated tablets.

AB A novel microemulsion was developed and characterized for topical delivery of Dencichine (Den). Two imidazaolium ionic liquid, 1-hydroxyethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([HOEIM]Cl) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium dodecanesulfate ([BMIM]C12SO3) were incorporated into the aqueous and surfactant phases respectively for the remarkable enhancement on skin permeation. The nano-carrier was developed and optimized based on a pseudo-ternary phase diagram. The optimized formulation was composed of 50% water/[HOEIM]Cl mix (1: 1) as water phase, 20% Tween 80/[BMIM] C12SO3 mix (1:1) as surfactant, 10% propylene glycol as co-surfactant and 20% IPM as oil phase. The o/w microemulsion was then characterized for droplets sizes (47.7 +/- 1.5 nm), zeta potential (-14.83 +/- 3.64 mV), viscosity (31 +/- 4 mPa) and pH (6.71 +/- 0.04). In-vitro skin permeation assay suggested the strong enhancement of ILs formulation on the topical delivery of Den, which was approximately 10-fold that of the drug aqueous solution. It was found that the nano-carrier can reduce the skin barrier properties by disrupting the regular and compact arrangements of corneocytes, and moderating the surface properties of the stratum corneum, as evidenced by Transdermal Water Loss Evaluation (TEWL), Differential Scanning Calorimetery (DSC) and attenuated total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Furthermore, the in-vivo pharmacodynamic evaluation indicated the significant hemostatic activity of Den by the topical application of the vehicle. Additionally, the formulation showed minor cell toxicity and skin irritation. Therefore, our work suggested that the ionic liquid microemulsion can be a promising nano-scale vehicle for the topical application of Den to produce desirable pharmacological effects.

AB Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) is the main bioactive flavonoid extracted from the flower of Carthamus tinctorius L., which is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of myocardial ischemia and cerebral ischemia. HSYA has high water solubility but poor intestinal membrane permeability, resulting in low oral bioavailability. Currently, only HSYA sodium chloride injection has been approved for clinical use and oral formulations are urgently needed. In this study, HSYA solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) with the structure of w/o/w were prepared by a warm microemulsion process using approved drug excipients for oral delivery to increase the oral absorption of HSYA. The optimized HSYA SLNs are spherical with an average size of 214 nm and the encapsulation efficiency is 55%. HSYA SLNs exhibited little cytotoxicity in Caco-2 and Hela cells, but increased the oral absorption of HSYA about 3.97-fold in rats, compared to HSYA water solution. In addition, cycloheximide pretreatment significantly decreased the oral absorption of HSYA delivered by SLNs. Importantly, the pharmacodynamics evaluation demonstrated that SLNs further decreased the infarct areas in rats. In conclude, SLNs could be a promising delivery system to enhance the oral absorption and pharmacological activities of HSYA.

AB Harmonized methodologies are urgently required for the taste evaluation of novel pediatric medicines. This study utilized in vitro, in vivo and clinical data to evaluate the palatability of a novel midazolam chocolate tablet. In vitro dissolution experiments showed the crushed tablet to release within 5 min 1.68 mg of midazolam into simulated saliva. This translated to a drug level of 0.84 mg/ml in the oral cavity, which would be higher than the midazolam bitterness detection threshold concentration of 0.03 mg/ml determined in a rat 'brief access taste aversion' (BATA) model. The visual analogue scale scores of patients aged 4-16 years prescribed with midazolam pre-surgery showed a clear preference for the midazolam chocolate tablets (3.35 +/- 1.04, n=20) compared to the control midazolam solution (1.47 +/- 0.62, n=17). The clinical data was in agreement with the in vivo rodent data in showing the novel chocolate tablet matrix to be effective at taste-masking the bitter midazolam.

AB The rate of release of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) from a topical semisolid dosage form can be influenced by its physical and structural properties. An In Vitro Release Test (IVRT) is an established method to characterize this rate of API release and compare the underlying sameness in product quality characteristics. The purpose of this work was to validate an IVRT method to compare acyclovir cream, 5% products. However, despite widespread use of the IVRT since 1997, there has been no established approach to validate an IVRT method. Our approach included: 1) qualification of the diffusion cell apparatus, 2) qualification of the laboratory, 3) validation of the HPLC analytical method, and 4) validation of numerous critical parameters of the IVRT method, itself, and resulted in a comprehensive and successful IVRT method validation. Subsequent to the IVRT validation work described here, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drafted a guidance on the development and validation of an IVRT method for acyclovir cream, 5%. Although there are notable differences between our approach and the approach in that guidance, this report illustrates how many of the same essential qualification parameters and validation concepts were considered and systematically addressed in our approach to IVRT validation.

AB This work investigated the impact of formulation including in vitro release profile, repeated dosing, and nail poration on the ex vivo nail delivery performance of antifungal formulations. Chitosan coated and uncoated tioconazole-loaded nanocapsules and a nano-based film-forming vehicle were assessed via in vitro release and in vitro permeation tests using an artificial membrane and human nail clippings, respectively. The later involved single and daily dosing experiments with intact and porated nails. Additional experiments with Nile Red-loaded formulations evaluated the depth of penetration of the fluorescent marker into the nail by laser scanning confocal microscopy. The nanocapsule formulations prolonged release of tioconazole for longer than the control solutions and this ability was related to an enhanced nail penetration of the drug. Further, the new film-forming formulation delivered its drug payload more efficiently than a marketed product. Daily dosing of the formulations doubled the amount of drug recovered from the nails. Porating the nails enhanced tioconazole delivery in single dose experiments only. The depth of penetration of Nile Red into the nails clippings ranged between 90-160 mu m. This research suggests that ensuring prolonged release of a drug is fundamental to develop efficacious topical nail formulations.

AB During the past decades, chemotherapy has been regarded as the most effective method for tumor therapy, but still faces significant challenges, such as poor tumor selectivity and multidrug resistance. The development of targeted drug delivery systems brings certain dramatic advantages for reducing the side effects and improving the therapeutic efficacy. Coupling a specific stimuli-triggered drug release mechanism with these delivery systems is one of the most prevalent approaches for targeted therapy. Among these approaches, pH-sensitive micelles are regarded as the most general strategy with advantages of increasing solubility of water-insoluble drugs, pH-sensitive release, high drug loading, etc.
   This review will focus on the potential of pH-sensitive micelles in tumor therapy, analyze four types of drug-loaded micelles and mechanisms of drug release and give an exhaustive collection of recent investigations. Sufficient understanding of these mechanisms will help us to design more efficient pH-sensitive drug delivery system to address the challenges encountered in targeted drug delivery systems for tumor therapy.

AB Since their discovery over 100 years ago cyclodextrins (CDs) have been the subject of numerous scientific publications. In 2016 alone CDs were the subject of over 2200 research articles published in peer-reviewed journals and mentioned in over 2300 patents and patent applications, many of which were on pharmaceutical applications. Natural CDs and their derivatives are used as enabling pharmaceutical excipients that enhance aqueous solubility of poorly soluble drugs, increase drug permeability through biological membranes and improve drug bioavailability. Unlike conventional penetration enhancers, their hydrophilic structure and high molecular weight prevents them from penetrate into lipophilic membranes leaving biological membranes intact. The natural CDs and some of their derivatives have monographs in pharmacopeias and are also commonly used as food additives and in toiletry products. CDs form inclusion complexes with lipophilic moieties of hydrophobic drugs. Furthermore, CDs are able to form non-inclusion complexes and self-assembled aggregates; small and large complex aggregates with micellar-like structures that can enhance drug solubility. Excipients commonly used in pharmaceutical formulations may have additive or inhibiting effect on the CD solubilization. Here various methods used to investigate CD aggregate formation are reviewed as well as techniques that are used to increase the solubilizing effects of CDs; methods that enhance the apparent intrinsic solubility of drugs and/or the complexation efficacy and decrease the amount of CD needed to develop CD-containing pharmaceutical formulations. It will be explained how too much or too little CD can hamper drug bioavailability, and the role of CDs in solid dosage forms and parenteral formulations, and examples given on how CDs can enhance drug delivery after ocular, nasal and pulmonary administration.

AB Purpose: The aim of this research work was to explore the possibility of providing multifunctional oral insulin delivery system by conjugating several types of dipeptides on chitosan and trimethyl chitosan to be used as drug carriers.
   Method: Conjugates of Glycyl-glycine and alanyl-alanine of chitosan and trimethyl chitosan (on primary alcohol group of polymer located on carbon 6) were synthesized and nanoparticles containing insulin were prepared for oral delivery. Preparation conditions of nanoparticles were optimized and their performance to enhance the permeability of insulin as well as cytotoxicity of nanoparticles in Caco-2 cell line was evaluated. To evaluate the efficacy of orally administered nanoparticles, nanoparticles with the most permeability enhancing ability were studied in male Wistar rats as animal model by measuring insulin and glucose Serum levels.
   Result: Structural study of all the conjugates by infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance confirmed the successful formation of the conjugates with the desirable substitution degree. By optimizing preparation conditions, nanoparticles with expected size (157.3-197.7 nm), Zeta potential (24.35-34.37 mV), polydispersity index (0.365-0.512), entrapment efficiency (70.60-86.52%) and loading capacity (30.92-56.81%), proper morphology and desirable release pattern were obtained. Glycyl-glycine and alanylalanine conjugate nanoparticles of trimethyl chitosan showed 2.5-3.3 folds more effective insulin permeability in Caco-2 cell line than their chitosan counterparts. In animal model, oral administration of glycyl-glycine and alanyl-alanine conjugate nanoparticles of trimethyl chitosan demonstrated reasonable increase in Serum insulin level with relative bioavailability of 17.19% and 15.46% for glycyl-glycine and alanyl-alanine conjugate nanoparticles, respectively, and reduction in Serum glucose level compared with trimethyl chitosan nanoparticles (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: It seems that glycyl-glycine and alanyl-alanine conjugate nanoparticles of trimethyl chitosan have met the aim of this research work and have been able to orally deliver insulin with more than one mechanism in animal model. Hence, they are promising candidates for further research studies.

AB [6]-Gingerol, one of the components of the rhizome of Ginger, has a variety of biological activities such as anticoagulant, antioxidative, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, and so forth. However, as one of the homologous phenolic ketones, [6]-gingerol is insoluble in water which limits its applications. Herein, we prepared [6]-gingerol proliposomes through modified thin-film dispersion method, which was spherical or oval, and physicochemically stable with narrow size distribution. Surprisingly, in vitro release of [6]-gingerol loaded proliposome compared with the free [6]-gingerol was significantly higher and its oral bioavailability increased 5-fold in vivo. Intriguingly, its antitumor effect was enhanced in the liposome formulation. Thus, our prepared [6]-gingerol proliposome proved to be a novel formulation for [6]-gingerol, which significantly improved its antitumor effect.

AB Three dimensional (3D) extrusion-based printing is a paste-based rapid prototyping process, which is capable of building complex 3D structures. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of 3D extrusion-based printing as a pharmaceutical manufacture technique for the fabrication of gastro-floating tablets. Novel low-density lattice internal structure gastro-floating tablets of dipyridamole were developed to prolong the gastric residence time in order to improve drug release rate and consequently, improve bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. Excipients commonly employed in the pharmaceutical study could be efficiently applied in the room temperature 3D extrusion-based printing process. The tablets were designed with three kinds of infill percentage and prepared by hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC K4M) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC E15) as hydrophilic matrices and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC PH101) as extrusion molding agent. In vitro evaluation of the 3D printed gastro-floating tablets was performed by determining mechanical properties, content uniformity, and weight variation. Furthermore, re-floating ability, floating duration time, and drug release behavior were also evaluated. Dissolution profiles revealed the relationship between infill percentage and drug release behavior. The results of this study revealed the potential of 3D extrusion-based printing to fabricate gastro-floating tablets with more than 8 h floating process with traditional pharmaceutical excipients and lattice internal structure design.

AB The work aimed to evaluate the feasibility to design hyaluronic acid (HA) decorated flexible liposomes to enhance the skin penetration of nifedipine. Egg phosphatidylcholine (e-PC) based transfersomes (Tween 80) and transethosomes (ethanol) were prepared. HA was reacted with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (HA-DPPE) and two molar ratios (0.5 and 3%) of conjugate with respect to e-PC were tested. The presence of HA significantly increased the packing order of the bilayer (as verified by differential scanning calorimetry), reducing both the encapsulation efficiency and the flexibility of the decorated liposomes in a dose-dependent manner. In fact, at the highest HA content the constant of deformability (K, N/mm) increased and the carriers remained on the skin surface after topical application. The stiffening effect of HA was counterbalanced by the addition of ethanol as fluidizing agent that allowed to maintain the highest HA concentration, meanwhile reducing the K value of the vesicles. HA-transethosomes allowed a suitable nifedipine permeation (J similar to 30 ng/cm(2)/h) and significantly improved the drug penetration, favouring the formation of a drug depot in the epidermis. These data suggest the potentialities of HA-transethosomes as drug delivery systems intended for the treatment of cutaneous pathologies and underline the importance of studying the effect of surface functionalization on carrier deformability to rationalize the design of such systems.

AB A new scale-down methodology from commercial rotary die scale to laboratory scale was developed to optimize a plant-derived soft gel capsule formulation and eventually manufacture superior soft gel capsules on a commercial scale, in order to reduce the time and cost for formulation development. Animal-derived and plant-derived soft gel film sheets were prepared using an applicator on a laboratory scale and their physicochemical properties, such as tensile strength, Young's modulus, and adhesive strength, were evaluated. The tensile strength of the animal-derived and plant-derived soft gel film sheets was 11.7 MPa and 4.41 MPa, respectively. The Young's modulus of the animal-derived and plant-derived soft gel film sheets was 169 MPa and 17.8 MPa, respectively, and both sheets showed a similar adhesion strength of approximately 4.5-10 MPa. Using a D-optimal mixture design, plant-derived soft gel film sheets were prepared and optimized by varying their composition, including variations in the mass of kappa-carrageenan, iota-carrageenan, oxidized starch and heat-treated starch. The physicochemical properties of the sheets were evaluated to determine the optimal formulation. Finally, plant-derived soft gel capsules were manufactured using the rotary die method and the prepared soft gel capsules showed equivalent or superior physical properties compared with pre-existing soft gel capsules. Therefore, we successfully developed a new scale-down methodology to optimize the formulation of plant-derived soft gel capsules on a commercial scale.

AB Poor water-solubility remains a typical property of drug candidates in pharmaceutical development pipelines today. Various processes have been developed to increase the solubility, dissolution rate, and bioavailability of these active ingredients belonging to biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS) II and IV classifications. Since the early 2000s, nanocrystal delivery and amorphous solid dispersions are more established techniques to overcome the limitations of poorly-water soluble drugs in FDA available products. This article provides an updated review of nanocrystal and amorphous solid dispersion techniques primarily for orally delivered medicaments. The thermodynamic and kinetic theories relative to these technologies are presented along with marketed product evaluations and a survey of commercially relevant scientific literature.

AB Based on a computer tomographic scan of a human trachea, a modified induction port (mIP), for use with the Next Generation Cascade Impactor, was manufactured using 3D printing technology. Standard United States Pharmacopoeia IP (USPIP) was compared to the mIP and a 3D printed version of the USPIP (USP3DIP) by analyzing different types of commercial salbutamol formulations for inhalation. Increased retention of particles in the mIP was found analyzing a pMDI formulation, leading to a decrease in the FPF from 28.8 +/- 2.0% to 14.2 +/- 1.2%, which correlates better to in vivo deposition data from literature. Increased deposition was found to be based on geometrical factors only. The impact of surface related effects was investigated by (a) comparing results obtained with the USPIP and USP3DIP (all formulations) and (b) generating another model IP (USP3DSEIP) with a surface area equivalent to the mIP but maintaining the geometry of the USPIP (pMDI only). USPIP, USP3DIP, and USP3DSEIP were found to perform equivalently. The impact of different geometries on airflow velocities in the USPIP and mIP was assessed using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Conclusively, this study shows that replacing the USP IP by the mIP can provide additional information in formulation assessment and in in vitro/in vivo correlation, when applied on pMDI formulations.

   Different methods are employed to monitor the interactions: UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence lifetime, circular dichroism and transmission electron microscopy. These studies have shown the formation of a complex between GNPs and both PGM and BSM.
   This aspect could be of great importance for the use of gold nanoparticles for biomedical purposes in those diseases where qualitative and quantitative mucin anomalies play an essential role in mucus composition and rheology.

AB Small-molecule agonists for the Toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and 8 are effective for the immunotherapy of skin cancer when used as topical agents. Their systemic use has however been largely unsuccessful due to dose-limiting toxicity. We propose a polymer-based nanodelivery system to target resiquimod, a TLR7 ligand, to the lymph node in order to focus the immunostimulatory activity and to prevent a generalized inflammatory response. We demonstrate successful encapsulation of resiquimod in methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(DL-lactic acid) (mPEG-PLA) and mixed poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)/mPEG-PLA nanoparticles. We show that these particles are taken up mainly by dendritic cells and macrophages, which are the prime initiators of anticancer immune responses. Nanoparticles loaded with resiquimod activate these cells, demonstrating the availability of the immune-stimulating cargo. The unloaded particles are non-inflammatory and do not have cytotoxic activity on immune cells. Following subcutaneous injection in mice, mPEG-PLA and PLGA/mPEG-PLA nanoparticles are detected in dendritic cells and macrophages in the draining lymph nodes, demonstrating the targeting potential of these particles. Thus, polymer-based nanoparticles represent a promising delivery system that allows lymph node targeting for small-molecule TLR7 agonists in the context of systemic cancer immunotherapy.

AB Protein-alginate complexes were prepared with the objective of quantifying the influence of the parameters such as protein characteristics on the final complex properties and their dissociation rates. Cytochrome C, lysozyme, myoglobin, chymotrypsin, and bovine serum albumin were used as model proteins for preparing the complexes and physical properties such as composition, average diameter, and zeta potential of the complexes formed were measured. In addition, protein release kinetics from the complexes in response to changes in pH and ionic strength were investigated. The results clearly demonstrated that, even in the absence of a cation, proteins could be complexed with alginate and showed a decreased release rate under the appropriate conditions. Projection to Latent Structures was applied as a multivariate statistical analysis method to mathematically describe the final properties and the protein release kinetics as a function of the influencing variables. It was found that the physical characteristics of the complexes could be accurately modelled with low error thresholds indicative of good fit and prediction capabilities of the model. The statistical model indicated that the release kinetics parameters were highly dependent on the ionic strength and the protein net charge as a function of pH, demonstrating the potential use of these complexes in ion-/pH-sensitive delivery systems.

AB Recent work has established polymer strip films as a robust platform for delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs via slurry casting, in particular using stable drug nanosuspensions. Here, a simpler, robust method to directly incorporate dry micronized poorly water-soluble drug, fenofibrate (FNB), is introduced. As a major novelty, simultaneous surface modification using hydrophilic silica along with micronization was done using fluid energy mill (FEM) in order to reduce FNB hydrophobicity and powder agglomeration. It is hypothesized that silica coating promotes easy, uniform dispersion of micronized and coated FNB (MC-FNB) during direct mixing with aqueous hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC-E15LV) and glycerin solutions. Uniform dispersion leads to improved film critical quality attributes (CQAs) such as appearance, drug content uniformity and drug dissolution. The impact of polymer solution viscosity (low and high), mixer type (low versus high shear), and FNB surface modification on film CQAs were also assessed. Films with as-received FNB (AR-FNB) and micronized uncoated FNB (MU-FNB) were prepared as control. When MC-FNB powders were used, films exhibited improved appearance (thickness uniformity, visible lumps/agglomerates), better drug content uniformity (expressed as relative standard deviation), fast and immediate drug release, and enhanced mechanical properties (tensile strength, elongation percentage), regardless of the polymer solution viscosity or mixer type. These results compare favorably with those reported using nanosuspensions of FNB, establishing the feasibility of directly incorporating surface modified-micronized poorly water-soluble drug powders in film manufacturing.

AB In this paper, we develop an efficient lattice Boltzmann model for the two-phase moving contact line problem with variable density. The Navier-Stokes and Cahn-Hilliard equations are recovered from the lattice Boltzmann model proposed by Fakhari and Rahimian [5]. To improve numerical stability, we present a semi-implicit lattice Boltzmann method together with a mixed finite difference scheme. In order to describe the behavior of the contact line motion on the boundary, we incorporate the generalized Navier boundary condition [25] by the nonequilibrium extrapolation method [8]. The proposed method is easy to implement and retains the advantage of the standard lattice Boltzmann method. Numerical tests are carried out to verify the proposed method. Our numerical results show that the present approach is able to model two-phase flows with variable density and moving contact line. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We propose a new approach, which we term as scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach, to construct efficient and accurate time discretization schemes for a large class of gradient flows. The SAV approach is built upon the recently introduced IEQ approach. It enjoys all advantages of the IEQ approach but overcomes most of its shortcomings. In particular, the SAV approach leads to numerical schemes that are unconditionally energy stable and extremely efficient in the sense that only decoupled equations with constant coefficients need to be solved at each time step. The scheme is not restricted to specific forms of the nonlinear part of the free energy, so it applies to a large class of gradient flows. Numerical results are presented to show that the accuracy and effectiveness of the SAV approach over the existing methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The [GeS1.5](100) - I-x(x) = 0 divided by 10) glasses are prepared by the reaction of germanium, sulfur and germanium (IV) iodide in vacuumed silica-glass ampoules at a temperature of 750-800 degrees C. Thermal, optical properties of glasses and their stability against crystallization are investigated. It is established, that, as the content of iodine in the matrix is increased from 0 to 10 at.%, the glass transition temperature value is decreased monotonically from 377 to 316 degrees C, and the short-wavelength transmission edge is shifted into the visible region from 811 to 605 nm. The stability against crystallization of the samples, estimated from the volume fraction of the crystalline phase after high-temperature annealing, raises with increasing iodine content. The investigated regularities of changes in the glass properties are interpreted within the framework of the glass net structure. As the most proper glasses in the Ge-S-I system for IR fiber optics, the [GeS1.5](90)I-10, [GeS1.5](92)I-8 and [GeS1.5](95)I-5 glass compositions are proposed.

Numerically simulated spectra extending from similar to 1 mu m to > 8 mu m are demonstrated for pump energy of order 100 pJ in a fiber with a core diameter of 2 mu m. To the best of our knowledge, the possibility of such long-wavelength spectral conversion of pump pulses at the wavelength of 2 mu m in optical fibers is demonstrated for the first time. The theoretical calculations are performed on the base of real low loss step-index As-Se-Te/As-S glass fibers with various core-clad diameter ratios.

AB We designed and developed tapered suspended-core fibers of high-purity As39Se61 glass for supercontinuum generation in the mid-IR with a standard fiber laser pump source at 2 mu m. It was shown that microstructuring allows shifting a zero dispersion wavelength to the range shorter than 2 mu m in the fiber waist with a core diameter of about 1 mu m. In this case, supercontinuum generation in the 1-10 mu m range was obtained numerically with 150-fs 100-pJ pump pulses at 2 mu m. We also performed experiments on wavelength conversion of ultrashort optical pulses at 1.57 mu m from Er: fiber laser system in the manufactured As-Se tapered fibers. The measured broadening spectra were in a good agreement with the ones simulated numerically.

AB A series of barium gallium-germanate glasses (84-x) GeO2-14BaO-2Ga(2)O(3-x) Bi2O3 (x = 0; 0,1; 1; 3; 5 mol%) was synthesized by crucible technology. It was revealed that the appearance of a BaGe4O9 crystalline phase took place after additional thermal treatment of the glass samples. The structural and optical properties of the glasses and glass-ceramics were studied. It was shown that the spectral shapes and the peak positions of the absorption, luminescence and excitation bands strongly depend on the type of materials. In particular, the absorption band peaked at 480 and 660 nm is characteristic for the glass samples whereas in the absorption spectrum of the glass-ceramic two bands at 480 nm and 560 nm were observed. Moreover, with the appearance of a crystalline phase, the luminescence peak shifts towards shorter wavelengths, while its intensity increases. The possible states of Bi ions in the BaGe4O9 crystalline phase were calculated using a molecular cluster model. The obtained results indicate that an incorporated in the crystalline phase Bi+ ion could be considered as a possible near IR luminescence source.

AB This work reports on back-electron injection barrier property and electrical charge storing behavior of PEDOT film with and without substituted propylene as terminal group. As a barrier layer, thin polymer film is deposited on TiO2 particles of DSSC using photo-induced polymerization route. The same piece of DSSC device is used before and after deposition of polymer thin-film for studying the influence of interfacial treatment. The propylene substituted PEDOT treatment of the device demonstrates an enhanced power conversion efficiency from 4.31 to 5.96% whereas the unsubstituted PEDOT treated device shows only the power conversion enhancement from 4.54 to 5.31%. This finding suggests the higher barrier performance of the propylene substituted PEDOT for back-electron injections. Unlike the barrier performance, the propylene substituted PEDOT shows poorer electrical charge storing behavior with specific capacitance of 63.47 F g(-1) whereas the unsubstituted PEDOT film achieved 96.84 F g(-1).

AB In this letter, a novel visible light-driven TiO2/BiVO4 heterostructure thin film has been successfully fabricated via an advanced screen printing method. The photocatalytic hydrogen production was investigated by varying amount of TiO2 loading (0, 0.1, 0.8 and 1.2 wt%) on the surface of BiVO4 from water splitting in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell and dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) system. The crystallographic, morphological and chemical composition properties of the prepared TiO2/BiVO4 thin film was investigated by using different characterization techniques. The 0.8 wt% TiO2/BiVO4 was identified as the most efficient photocatalyst by producing maximum accumulative hydrogen of 692 mu mol within 120 min. The maximum hydrogen production obtained is attributed to a compact particle network between BiVO4 and TiO2 particles which provide an intimate contact with the electron collecting FTO substrate.

AB In this paper, silica nanoparticles and silica coated with ionic liquid polymer nanoparticles (PIL/SiO2) were prepared. They are both monodisperse and smooth spheres, and also own suitable densities and excellent chromaticity. Porous silica benefits their low density, which decreases the gravitational sedimentation and avails electrophoretic mobility. The ionic liquid polymer coating of PIL/SiO2 not only favors hydrophobicity and dispersity stability, but also helps the enrichment of trace polar impurities around the particles, which makes for ionization effect and electrophoretic mobility. The PIL/SiO2 show greatly improved hydrophobicity and electrophoretic mobility. The PIL/SiO2 in the fabricated EPD prototype with thickness of 0.2 mm shows response time of 155 ms, much faster than the silica nanoparticles, TiO2 previously reported and commercial EPDs.

AB Novel hollow molecularly imprinted polymer (HMIPs) microspheres were synthesized via two-stage dispersion polymerization and swelling seed polymerization technique with nicotinamide (NAM) as the template molecule. Binding experiments showed that the HMIPs possessed excellent binding properties toward N-nitroamines, including fast mass transfer rate, and efficient adsorption performance with the adsorption capacity reaching up to 1.7 mg/g, which was 3 times higher than that of hollow non-imprinted polymers (HNIPs). The fast binding kinetics for one N-nitrosamine (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1 -(3-pyridine)-1-butanone, NNK) was attributed to the hollow porous structure with the imprinted cavities on both external and internal surface of the HMIPs.

AB Superhydrophobic ceramic coatings with high water contact angle and excellent water repellency were fabricated by a one-step solution precursor plasma spray process without using any low-surface-energy polymeric modifiers. The coating composition and microstructure were characterized, and showed a two-length scale micron/nano-sized hierarchical structure. The hydrophobicity of the coatings was tested via water contact angle measurement, water roll-off angle and droplet impact tests. The water contact angle of the coatings reached 163 degrees and the water roll-off angle was about 6.5 degrees. The microstructure and hydrophobicity of the coatings could be varied by tailoring the parameters of the spraying process. The results indicate that solution precursor plasma spray is an efficient method by which to fabricate various hydrophobic ceramic coatings in large scale. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new cross-linked shell microencapsulated phase change materials (MEPCMs) were prepared by interfacial polymerization, and butyl stearate and polyurethane was empolyed as core material and shell material respectively, while polyurethane shell was reacted by isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), diethylene triamine (DETA) and pentaerythritol. The surface morphology, chemical structure, phase change properties and thermal stability of MEPCMs were investigated by SEM, FTIR, DSC and TGA. The results show that the prepared microcapsules are sphere with smooth and compact surface, and have good thermal storage properties. When pentaerythritol was employed, the thermal stability and compactness of the crosslinked polyurethane shell MEPCMs has been greatly improved compared to that of linear polyurea shell MEPCMs. When the continuous drying time point is at 120 degrees C for 5 h, the weight loss of cross-linked MEPCMs was only 4.65%.

AB Core-shell silica particles with fibrous shell structure and tunable pore size were prepared by using a dultemplate method. The pore size of the core-shell silica particles was affected greatly by the amount of octadecylamine, which as used as cosurfactant. The pore size could be enlarged from 7.1 nm to 22.3 nm while keeping the unique fibrous shell structure. After derivatized with C18, the separation performances of these particles with a wider pore size were investigated. The column efficiency was as high as 219,789 plates m (1) for dimethylnaphthalene. Baseline separation of proteins ranging in size from 12 to 66 kD was achieved within 5 min. The separation results demonstrate that the synthesized core-shell silica particles would be a promising packing material in the rapid and high-resolution separation of both small solutes and macromolecules.

AB The Ag and ZnO nanoparticles are synthesized by a green method using Lawsonia inermis plant extract. The phytochemical constituent (2-hydroxy-1, 4-napthoquionone) found in the leaf extract of Lawsonia inermis plays an important role in the reduction and formation of Ag and ZnO nanoparticles. The biosynthesis of Ag and ZnO NPs was observed by the color change from colorless to dark brown and light brown. The FE SEM, TEM DLS analysis confirmed the average particle size of Ag and ZnO NPs as 100 nm, 20 nm, 28.5 nm and 100 nm, 20 nm, 38.4 nm respectively. Crystalline nature and presence of Ag and ZnO NPs were confirmed by XRD. The FT-IR spectra of the Ag and ZnO authorized the presence of phyto constituents as capping agent. From results of acute oral toxicity studies, it was found that Ag and ZnO NPs at 2000 mg/kg b.w have shown no mortality during the treatment period. The present study revealed the safer use of eco-friendly green synthesized Ag and ZnO NPs in the field of nano-biomedicine. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The nanocrystalline BCNO was observed by scanning electron microscope. Results from Xray diffraction show a prominent peak at 28.13 degrees for BCNO, indicating the interlayer distance of 0.317 nm. Elemental compositions and chemical bonds of BCNO were verified by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. Electrical measurement of BCNO-based field effect transistors gave 0.3 cm(2) V (1) s (1) of charge mobility, 0.77 eV of band gap with 10(5) of on/off ratio. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Cu2SnS3 (CTS) thin films have been investigated extensively as an absorber layer for photovoltaic applications owing to the use of low-cost and earth-abundant materials. However, the performance of CTS solar cells still suffers from voltage deficit, resulting in a low value of open-circuit voltage (V-oc). In this study, we introduce a Ge layer into CTS materials using Ge metal target as a doping source. Subsequently, the sputtered Cu/Ge/Sn precursors are sulfurized under sulfur vapor ambient to form a Cu-2(Sn, Ge)S-3 (CTGS) thin film. Meanwhile, we also fabricate a CTS solar cell under the same experimental conditions as compared with CTGS solar cell. The Ge layer of thickness approximately 20 nm enhanced the efficiency from 0.45% (CTS) to 3.05% (CTGS), whereas the improvement in performance was limited for Ge layer of thickness more than 20 nm.

AB Due to the wide bandgap of SiC, SiC-based optoelectronic devices can not be operated by visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) light sources. A promising way to solve this problem is to adopt a SiC/Ge/Graphene heterostructure. The Ge film can be used as VIS-NIR-absorbing layer. As a electrode, graphene also forms a Schottky junction with Ge on 4H-SiC. To form the SiC/Ge/graphene heterostructures, Ge film was prepared on 4H-SiC(0001) by chemical vapor deposition, and then graphene on Cu foil was wet transferred on Ge films. The Ge film on 4H-SiC(0001) has polycrystalline structure and consists of self-assembled submicron Ge islands. The monolayer graphene with a few cracks and wrinkles was transferred on the Ge rough surface. The SiC/Ge/graphene heterostructure with high light absorption in the 500-1200 nm range was prepared on 4H-SiC successfully. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Presence of the tertiary amine in the reaction mixture during surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) possess dual functionality, reduction of the graphene oxide (GO) and proceed the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) chain growth simultaneously. In the certain ratio between the ligand and GO, the slight reduction of the GO can be achieved and thus fine tuning of the conductivity is possible. Such benefits were utilized in the development of the novel dispersed phase based on GO-PMMA hybrid particles and their silicone oil suspensions for which their electro-responsive capabilities were investigated. This approach provides system which is very effective at very low particles concentrations (10 wt%) and serving the shear stresses from 5 to 95 Pa depending on the conductivity of particles and applied external electric field.

AB An efficient and scalable method to prepare polylactic acid stereocomplex microspheres (sc-PLA-MPs) is achieved. Low molecular weight polylactic acid containing triethoxysilane end-groups (Si-PLA) were firstly synthesized via coupling reaction of 3-(triethoxysilyl) propyl isocyanate with low molecular weight poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) and poly (D-lactic acid) (PDLA). Then, the triethoxysilane terminated poly (L-lactic acid) and poly (D-lactic acid) were dissolved in 1,4-dioxane where the triethoxysilane end-groups could hydrolytic condense in-situ, leading to the formation of the architecture having both PLLA and PDLA arms in one molecule, and consequently the stereocomplex microparticles spontaneously precipitated in the form of spherical microspheres with size of approximately similar to 5 mu m.

AB We present a solution-based approach for fabrication of CuIn(1-x)GaxSe2 (CIGS) nanowires by electrode-position method with stoichiometry close to the ideal one for photovoltaic applications. Fabrication of CIGS nanowires is based on a one-step electrodeposition to deposit CIGS nanowires into the nanometer-scale cylindrical pores of the anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) template with molybdenum (Mo) thin-film deposited on the backside of the AAO as the counter electrode. A key to the commercialization of CIGS nanowires as active absorber layer for photovoltaic applications is to improve the composition control and quality of the CIGS nanowires. In this study, CIGS nanowires with close to the ideal stoichiometry and chalcopyrite nanocrystalline structure for photovoltaic applications were obtained by varying the deposition parameters such as deposition potential and electrolyte's composition during electrodeposition and the annealing process after electrodeposition.

AB A Tb-containing metal-organic gel (Tb-MOG) with excellent photoluminescence properties was synthesized via simple mixing of Tb3+ as the central metal ions and 4-[2, 2 ': 6 '', 2 ''-terpyridine]-4'-ylbenzoic acid (Hcptpy) as the ligands under a mild condition. The Tb-MOG exhibits mechano reversibility, thermal stability, acid and alkali tolerance. Moreover, the MOG shows a specific sensing to nitrite based on energy transfer. Test papers containing Tb-MOG were prepared and successfully realised the selective visual recognition of nitrite, which makes the MOG as a sensor more adaptive to practical application.

AB In this paper, a Cu/SnAg3.0Cu0.5/Cu solder joint is current stressed under 6 A at 120 degrees C. After current stressing for 300 h, a serrated interface and voids are observed at the cathode. Current-crowding and thermal-crowding in solder grooves between adjacent Cu6Sn5 grains are found to be responsible for the back-diffusion of Sn and Cu atoms, eventually leading to the formation of a cathodic serrated interface and voids. In addition, the Sn orientation of the solder grooves may also play an important role in the robustness of the cathodic Cu6Sn5 grains and electrode. Our study may provide understanding of electro migration/thermomigration-induced evolution of the Cu/Sn interface under current stressing and provide visual data for interpreting early open-circuit failure of solder joints.

AB Ytterbium-doped transparent lutetium oxide (Yb:Lu2O3) ceramics were fabricated from laser ablated nanoparticles via vacuum pre-sintering followed by hot isostatic pressing (HIPing). Nano-sized powder was uniaxially pressed and pre-sintered at 1550 degrees C using a conventional regime composed of a slow ramp (3 degrees C/min) with subsequent holding (CRH), and a rate-controlled sintering (RCS) regime consisting of a progressive reduction in densification rates. Although the pre-sintered samples approached identical relative density of similar to 97%, the average grain size was decreased more than 30% by application of RCS regime. Pre-sintered Yb: Lu2O3 compacts were then HIPed to achieve full density and transparency. The optical attenuation coefficient of the ceramic pre-sintered by CRH regime was found to exceed that of the ceramic fabricated using RCS method by a factor of 2.1 at the wavelength of 1080 nm.

AB Morphology-controlled porous alpha-Fe2O3/SnO2 nanorods with uniform surface heterostructures have been fabricated by a facile surface modification of rod-like alpha-Fe2O3 nanomaterials by changing the adding amount of Sn composition, displaying the excellent selectivity and sensitivity of gas-sensing to acetone. The introduction of SnO2 nanoparticles had the great effects on tuning the crystal size, crystallinity, and surface status, as well as the structural stability and phase distribution of alpha-Fe2O3/SnO2 nanorods. Compared to pure alpha-Fe2O3, alpha-Fe2O3/SnO2 heterostructures can exhibit the optimal gas-sensing behavior with the sensitivity up to 53.1 and the response and recovery times decreasing to 9 and 2.5 s at the operating temperature of 260 degrees C, respectively. The enhanced gas-sensing performance can be mainly attributed to the combination of uniform porous structures, narrow size-distribution, large specific surface area, and heterostructures of the interface between alpha-Fe2O3 and SnO2.

AB W and Al2O3 heterogeneous materials was bonded by using Cr as transition layer, and the diffusion behavior and resulted mechanical strength was studied. Results show that, Cr can diffuse and form metallurgical bonding with both W and Al2O3, and thus connect the heterogeneous materials together. The higher the sintering temperature and time is, the larger the diffusion distance and bonding strength is. Diffusion of Cr in W is defined as diffusion limited, while that in Al2O3 can be considered as interface controlled.

AB Amorphous coating was successfully fabricated on low carbon steel substrates with one-step laser cladding method using CoCrNiSiBFe high-entropy alloy powder. The microstructure and high-temperature wear mechanism of the fabricated coating was investigated. The coating exhibited layered microstructure including the columnar dendrites as the bottom layer and the amorphous-matrix layer with beta-Co phase as the minor phase. The content of amorphous phase in the upper surface was up to 85.1%. Different high temperature wear mechanism was exhibited by the two layers leading to a remarkable decrease of wear mass loss and thus a much better wear resistance in the amorphous layer.

AB A Cu nanowire array seamlessly grown on Cu wire was prepared by electrochemical reduction of copper oxide nanowires grown by thermal oxidation. The morphology and structure of the nanostructured Cu wires were characterized via scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscopy and Xray diffraction spectroscopy. The seamless surface nanostructure offered a large surface area and improved conductivity. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the seamless nanowires structure could electrochemically reduce nitrate due to the improved conductivity between the active sites and the substrate. A linear response to nitrate ions over a concentration range from 50 mu M to 600 mu M (R-2 = 0.9974) with a high sensitivity of 0.357 mu A mu M-1 cm(-1) and low detection limit of 12.2 mu M at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3, respectively, were obtained on the nanostructured copper wire. The influences of structure on electrochemical performance which are significant for the design of electrochemical sensor are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID MAGNESIUM ALLOYS
AB Feasibility of a ZM21 mini-tube to be used as biodegradable stent applications was studied mainly focusing on its microstructure, mechanical property and corrosion behaviors. This mini-tube was composed of alpha-Mg, a small amount of Mn0.815Si0.185 and possibly some undissolved Mn. Compressive yield strength, ultimate compressive strength and compressive strain of this mini-tube were 86.5 +/- 4.9 MPa, 347.7 +/- 15.0 MPa and 10.9 +/- 0.4%, respectively. It exhibited decent corrosion resistance in Hank's solution with a degradation rate of 0.26 mm/y. ZM21 mini-tube exhibited great potential to be used as biodegradable stents. But before that, localized corrosion should be well solved through impurity control and microstructure control. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Porous forsterite nanofibres were prepared by direct electrospinning method. The phase composition, morphology and pore structure of nanofibres were characterized. The porous nanofibres had highpurity for forsterite phase, mesoporous structure and a high specific surface area of 31.1 m(2) g(-1). The porous formation in forsterite nanofibres was driven by the Kirkendall diffusion effect. As the Mg ions diffused into SiO2 component faster, the forsterite phase formed on the silica side, and the previous voids occupied by Mg ions left behind and evolved into the Kirkendall pore structure. The porous forsterite nanofibres had a low thermal conductivity of 0.0463 W/m.K, indicating a potential application for thermal insulation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a novel morphology transformation of MAPbI(3) films which were doped with Rb and prepared by spin coating on a "mp-TiO2/bl-TiO2/FTO" substrate was demonstrated. A slight blue shift of the PL peak for MAPbI(3) with increase in RbI concentration was shown. The electronic properties of perovskite films, especially, conductivity type could be significantly tuned from n-type to p-type by doping with Rb. Carrier concentration and mobility could be controlled by adjusting dopant concentration. The investigation of the semiconductor properties of perovskite may shine light on future rational design of novel and more efficient perovskite solar cells. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Direct bonding process by using the conventional hot pressing was applied to prepare the dissimilar materials consisting of the thermoplastic resin and pure titanium (Ti) material. In employing the pressing temperature at the melting point of plastics, the interfacial bonding shear strength of the dissimilar material using polyamide66 (PA66) was drastically increased. Microstructure and phase analysis clarified that C=O double bonds of the carbonyl group was thermally decomposed and oxygen atoms contributed to diffusion into pure Ti or oxides formation at the interface. In addition, the chemical reaction of C-H and NATi formation was also effective to the interfacial bonding improvement. On the other hand, when polystyrene (PS) with no functional group including CAO/C=O bond was employed, for example, the PS-Ti dissimilar material showed no bonding strength even then the bonding temperature was close to 300 degrees C.

AB Herein, a simple, cheap and easily scaled-up procedure to obtain reduced graphene oxide from exfoliated graphene oxide using ferrocene and HNO3 is reported. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies show increased number of sp(2) domains in the rGO. The rGO shows specific surface area of similar to 369 m(2) g(-1) and is stable till 700 degrees C. The measured specific capacitance of rGO is 106.5 F/g ensures that the rGO is promising material for electrochemical double layer capacitors. The magnetic hysteresis loop of rGO reveals diamagnetic behavior. The reduction mechanism for the synthesis of rGO using ferrocene and HNO3 has been proposed. We hope this approach might facilitate scalable production of high-quality rGO sheets which could lead to future industrial graphene based devices for various applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Several semiconductor materials were used in the photodegradation of organic compounds. In this work, the films were obtained by deposition in FTO (Fluorine-Doped Tin Oxide) coated glass plates, solutions containing TiO2 and TiO2/WO3 fibers, synthesized by electrospinning and treated between 650-800 degrees C, to be used as semiconductors in heterogeneous photocatalysis. The morphology was identified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the crystalline structures were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the photocatalytic properties were analyzed by means of photodegradation analyzes of 125 mL of a 20 ppm solution of methyl orange dye under ultraviolet light. It should be noted that the formation of the crystalline phases is closely linked to the heat treatment temperature. The transition from the anatase phase to rutile is expected for heat treatments above 500 degrees C. The results indicate that the films based on fibers showed good photoactivity and can be used as photocatalysts, since the doping of TiO2 films with tungstic acid improved the photocatalytic efficiency of the materials by the significant reduction of the band gap range of TiO2.

AB A facile template-free hydrothermal method was proposed to synthesize 3D flower-like hollow Mg-Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs) microspheres. The structure and morphology characterization revealed that 3D flower-like hollow Mg-Al LDHs microspheres with a diameter of about 2.5 lm were assembled with numerous nanosheets. Interestingly, based on the optical diffusing test, 3D flower-like hollow Mg-Al LDHs microspheres exhibited suitable light transmittance, good diffusion capacity, and low incident angle dependence as light scattering materials for optical diffusers. Moreover, the possible light scattering mechanism was discussed and illustrated for the first time. Therefore, the results achieved in this study may provide valuable insights into the development of light scattering materials for high-performance optical diffusers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Amoebiasis, caused by Entamoeba histolytica, affects 50 million people worldwide, and results in 100,000 deaths annually. It is particularly prevalent in developing nations where poverty and poor sanitation contribute to contamination of food and water. E. histolytica is also a zoonotic protozoan parasite with the potential to infect non-human primates. Lemurs, primates endemic to Madagascar, are the most threatened mammalian group in the world due to habitat loss. As forests disappear, humans and lemurs come into more frequent contact, and the potential for E. histolytica to infect lemurs intensifies. Consequently, we screened 176 fecal samples from seven lemur species at eight sites in the rain forests of southeastern Madagascar for E. histolytica to determine if human proximity influenced lemur infection. Of samples examined, 4.0% (from three lemur species) were positive for E. histolytica. Of lemurs infected with E. histolytica, three (43%) exhibited diarrheal feces. Distance to human settlements explained the variation in E. histolytica infection seen in lemurs. These results provide the first evidence of E. histolytica in wild lemurs and highlight the need for additional work to better understand the eco-epidemiology of this potential threat to these species.

AB In this study, the high-lipid biomass accumulation of the microalga Micractinium sp. IC-76 in a 110-L flat panel photobioreactor was studied in detail. The productivity of microalgae biomass during phototrophic cultivation was 35.6 +/- 1.5 mg L-1 d(-1). The maximum content of neutral lipids with a high saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid content (44.1%) was observed on the 17th day of cultivation, which was optimal for processing into biodiesel. The main fatty acids of lipids were C16:0, C16:2, and C18:2, with contents of 26.0, 15.6 and 29.8%, respectively. The enzymatic transesterification of Micractinium sp. IC-76 lipids using cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) of Burkholderia cepacia lipase as biocatalysts was optimized by response surface methodology (RSM) to produce fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). This model determined that the optimum conditions for enzymatic transesterification of microalgal lipids with a maximal FAME yield of 92.3 +/- 1.5% were a temperature of 38 degrees C, a methanol to oil molar ratio of 1:3.1, a CLEA of 9.1% and a water content of 2.5% relative to the oil weight. This model has a high correlation with the experimental data and can be used to model the production of FAMEs from the lipids of Micractinium sp. IC-76 during process scaling.

AB Financial issues have been always one of major priorities in scheduling of energy systems. Although these systems are able to serve several types of energy demands but generated emission by these systems is a challenging problem. Since improvement of each one of mentioned issues has negative effects on the other issue therefore a trade-off solution is necessary to be obtained between these issues. In this paper, a multi-objective model has been presented to satisfy both economic and environmental objectives of a hub energy system in the presence of demand response program. In the proposed paper, epsilon-constraint and max-min fuzzy satisfying methods have been employed to solve and select the trade-off solution. The main reason of implementation of demand response program is to reduce operation cost and improve environmental performance of hub energy system. In fact, demand response program transfers some percentage of load from peak periods to off-peak periods to flatten load curve which leads to reduction of cost and emission. A mixed-integer linear programming has been used to simulate the proposed model and general algebraic modeling system software has been utilized to solve it. A sample hub energy system containing renewable and non-renewable energy resources has been studied and comparison results are presented to validate efficiency of proposed techniques.

AB A computational 2-D Eulerian-Eulerian approach was developed to simulate the hydrodynamics and heat transfer of a biomass gasification process in a pilot-scale bubbling fluidized bed reactor. The mathematical model was validated under experimental results collected from fluidization curves gathered at different temperatures in a pilot-scale reactor (75 kWth). Own user defined functions (UDFs) were developed in C programming and included to improve drag and heat transfer phenomena, as well to minimize deviations between experimental and numerical data found in previous works. Mesh selection was achieved by comparing solid fraction and pressure drop contours with grids comprised of different number of cells. A comparative study for particle diameter and inlet gas velocity was conducted for three different biomass feedstocks' and their impact in the mixing and segregation index was studied. Mixing and segregation index were measured by implementing the standard deviation concept. Results indicated that UDFs significantly improved the mathematical model predictions on the reactor's fluidization curves. Biomass and sand particles size and density showed direct influence on the solids distribution along the bed height. Smaller biomass particles revealed faster heat conduction and improved mixing properties.

AB Shade conditions in PV array invoke multiple power peaks in power-voltage characteristics and as a consequence, mismatch and power loss occur. To attenuate the shade effect, various researches worldwide have been actively engaged to dynamically reconfigure the PV array via different interconnection schemes. In this paper, a new puzzle based reconfiguration scheme is proposed and tested with 5 x 5 PV array. Following physical relocation scheme, the proposed dominance square method configures the PV modules of conventional Total Cross Tied (TCT) interconnection. Thus, row and column wise rearrangement helps to attain uniform row current difference with the method. To test the validity of the proposed scheme, seven shade patterns are critically evaluated. Response for every shade pattern is analyzed with the help of I-V, P-V characteristics and their corresponding losses are evaluated. Moreover, income generated and energy saving analysis for the method is also carried out.

AB Optimization of biodiesel production from non-edible papaya seed oil was investigated in this study. Biodiesel production process parameters such as catalyst concentration, methanol:oil molar ratio and reaction temperature were optimized by using the Response Surface methodology based on the Box-Behnken experimental design. Optimization of the transesterification process was conducted by varying three factors each at three different levels and this required a total of fifteen runs. A quadratic model was created to predict the biodiesel yield where the R-2 value was found to be 0.99 which indicates the satisfactory accuracy of the model. Based on the results, the optimum process parameters for transesterification of the papaya seed oil mixture at an agitation speed of 600 rpm over a period of 60 min were found to be a methanol:oil molar ratio 10:1, KOH catalyst concentration of 1 wt% and reaction temperature of 45 degrees C. At these reaction conditions, the predicted and experimental biodiesel yield were 96.12% and 96.48% respectively which shows less than 0.5% variation. The biodiesel properties were characterized and the results obtained were found to satisfy both ASTM D6751 and EN14214 standards. The statistical tool MINITAB 17 was used to draw both 3D surface plots and 2D contour plots to predict the optimum biodiesel yield.

AB The flue gas of natural gas boilers contains a large amount of water vapor, and the latent heat of flue gas can be effectively recovered by thermoelectric generation technology. The performance of thermoelectric generation can be significantly improved by gas humidification. In this study, the thermoelectric generation performance of flue gas and humidified flue gas were analyzed and compared using energy and exergy analysis, and irreversible losses in each link of the system were evaluated. The results showed that both generation efficiency and exergy efficiency increased when the flue gas condensed, with a notably larger increase of exergy efficiency. In the direct flue gas thermoelectric generator system, the maximum exergy destruction was caused by convective heat transfer at the hot side of the PN couple. Although the proportion of hot-side exergy destruction decreased with an increase of module area when the flue gas condensed, it was still the largest exergy destruction. The largest exergy destruction in the humidified flue-gas thermoelectric generator system was caused by humidification process at smaller module areas. With an increase in module area, the exergy destruction caused by heat conduction in the PN couple became the largest exergy destruction. Although exergy destruction was caused by flue gas humidification, the large decrease of exergy destruction at the hot side of the PN couple led to increased output power. Moreover, an increase of the heat transfer coefficient could also reduce the module area.

AB A key challenge in thermoelectric power conversion is to create a significant temperature difference (Delta T) across the thermoelectric generator (TEG). And one approach to create a larger temperature difference is to enhance heat transfer of the hot side of TEG. Thus, when a thermoelectric generator has been designed and manufactured, it is found that the heat exchangers of the thermoelectric device determines its performance. This paper investigated the differences as well as the advantages and disadvantages of three typical heat exchangers in a thermoelectric setup, and the power consumed by the auxiliary equipment to improve the thermoelectric performance were taken into account. For this purpose, a mathematical model has been developed. The accuracy of this model was verified via the experiments, by constructing and testing the prototypes. The results illustrate the net power output performance of thermoelectric devices with three different type of heat exchangers. The air cooling exchangers are shown a minimum auxiliary consumption whereas the heat pipe cooling exchanger are shown to be the most effective. At last, this article gets an economic analysis, and a new evaluation index associated with the power consumption of the auxiliary equipment is proposed. The results provided some practical guidelines for the design and application of practical thermoelectric power generations.

AB This paper interprets the energy flow from available primary fuel to end use in all of the provinces and territories in Canada for the year 2012 using Sankey diagrams. These flow charts illustrate energy production, imports, exports, and local consumption by economic sector, and quantify the amount of useful and rejected energy. The inflow and outflow values could help determine existing energy efficiencies and energy intensity improvement potential. The total energy available in the energy flow path for all of the provinces and territories is 27,494 PJ including imports. The diagrams clearly indicate that fossil fuels dominate Canada's energy mix. Approximately 99% of the fuel in Alberta came from fossil sources in 2012 and approximately 76% of Canada's energy came from fossil sources. Alberta produced the highest amount of available energy in Canada (11,986 PJ); the lowest came from the territories (72.7 PJ). Among the non-fossil generation, hydro-electricity dominated, followed by nuclear, wind, and biomass, respectively. The overall share of thermal-based generation (fossil-fuel, nuclear, and biomass) was found to be 37.1% of Canada's produced electricity (2,222 PJ) in 2012. An analysis of rejected and useful energy indicated that the transport sector showed the poorest energy efficiency. This pictorial view of energy flow could help policy makers set targets for improving energy efficiency, select strategies for the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions, and help satisfy the vast global climate change challenges.

AB The single-stage and two-stage thermophilic anaerobic digestion (TAD) in lab scale continuously stirred tank reactor systems fed semi-continuously with food waste (FW) were studied to compare their performance, energy balance and reaction processes. The experimental results showed the two TADs both had good performance at a sludge retention time (SRT) of 30 d. The VS destruction (83.22 +/- 1.33%) of the single-stage TAD was comparable with the two-stage TAD (82.02 +/- 1.25%) during the steady period. While the average biogas yield of the two-stage TAD (0.810 +/- 0.13 L/g Added VS) was higher than that of single-stage TAD (0.775 +/- 0.20 L/g Added VS) and the methane content of the former (59.1 +/- 1.4%) was lower than that of the latter (61.6 +/- 2.1%), the methane yields of the two TADs were similar. The single stage TAD had higher energy recovery, rate and specific rate of reaction for the four AD steps than the two-stage TAD. The two-stage TAD had to adjust its operational parameters to improve its AD efficiency.

AB An efficient prototype of a micro power generator with integrated micro combustor has been developed in the present study. The proposed design of the integrated micro-combustor provides high surface temperature with superior temperature uniformity and enhanced flame stability limits, a prerequisite for a thermoelectric power generation system. This novel micro combustor configuration consists of three backward facing steps with a recirculation hole fabricated in a rectangular heating medium of aluminium material. Parametric studies are carried out by varying the mixture inlet velocity, equivalence ratio and coolant flow rate to obtain the optimized operating conditions for maximum power generation. Two thermoelectric modules are mounted on the system operating with liquefied petroleum gas as fuel. A maximum conversion efficiency of 3.3% is obtained at phi = 0.95 with a mixture velocity of 7.5 m/s and a load resistance of 4 Omega across the thermoelectric generator. The effect of porous media is investigated to enhance the flame stability limits in the micro combustor. Porous media significantly enhances the upper flame stability limits and maximum conversion efficiencies (3.8%, 4.03%, and 3.73% at phi = 1, 0.9 and 0.8 at 10 m/s). A significantly higher power density (similar to 50% higher than existing systems) of 0.12 mW/mm(3) of system volume is achieved. A compact design of the prototype system with high conversion efficiency shows the possibility of its application for various systems requiring portable power for remote, stand-alone, military and aerospace applications.

AB The maximum efficiency for photovoltaic (PV) and thermoelectric generator (TEG) systems without concentration is investigated. Both a combined system where the TEG is mounted directly on the back of the PV and a tandem system where the incoming sunlight is split, and the short wavelength radiation is sent to the PV and the long wavelength to the TEG, are considered. An analytical model based on the Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit for PVs and the TEG figure of merit parameter zT is presented. It is shown that for non-concentrated sunlight, even if the TEG operates at the Carnot efficiency and the PV performance is assumed independent of temperature, the maximum increase in efficiency is 4.5 percentage points (pp.) for the combined case and 1.8 pp. for the tandem case compared to a stand alone PV. For a more realistic case with a temperature dependent PV and a realistic TEG, the gain in performance is much lower. For the combined PV and TEG system it is shown that a minimum zT value is needed in order for the system to be more efficient than a stand alone PV system.

AB A large amount of sheep dung (SD) produced on farms in China is a potential feedstock for production of clean energy in the form of biogas. Similarly, waste paper can be a notable energy source that is worth exploiting. In this study, we assessed the feasibility of co-digesting nitrogen-rich SD with the carbon-rich corrugated board (CB) or waste office paper (OP) in varying volatile solids (VS) ratios, to produce methane. Synergistic effect of co-digesting SD with CB and SD with OP on methane production was found in this study. The highest methane yields of 151.62 and 198.85 mL/g-VS were obtained during the co-digestions of SD with CB at 4:1 ratio (SDCB) and SD with OP at 2:3 ratio (SDOP), respectively. High-throughput 16 S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that the microbial diversity and richness in SDCB and SDOP co-digests were higher than in SD and OP mono digests, respectively. Characteristic bacteria and archaea in the digests were strongly substrate-related and might contribute to methane production. The validated results indicated that methane production through anaerobic co-digestion of SD and waste paper can be an efficient way that could not only reduce environmental pollution but also contribute to methane production.

AB This work compares various chemicals for use as extractants in second-generation Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol fermentation on economic and environmental bases. Both non-toxic and toxic extractants are considered in this study. The combinative extractive-distillation separation process was modelled using a combination of Microsoft Excel 2013, MATLAB 2015 and Aspen Plus v8.8. Separation trains were designed and optimized for each extractant to best take advantage of extractant properties. Upstream units considered in this analysis include: biomass (switchgrass) solids processing, biomass pre-treatment and saccharification, and fermentation. Downstream processes considered include utility generation and wastewater treatment. The cost of CO2 equivalent emissions avoided (CCA) was used as the metric to compare the environmental impact of each process as compared to conventional petroleum-based gasoline. The economic and environmental best extractant is shown to be 2-ethyl-hexanol with a minimum butanol selling price of $1.58/L and a CCA of $471.57/tonne CO2 equivalent emissions avoided.

AB For the first time, this study has provided a renewable energy based replacement for the internal combustion engine of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). A novel battery/PV/wind hybrid power source is proposed to replace the internal combustion engine with a small-size photovoltaic (PV) module positioned on the roof of the PHEV, and a micro wind turbine located in front of the PHEV, behind the condenser of the air conditioning system. The proposed power source equipped with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology is composed of a 19.2 kWh Lithium (Li)-ion battery used as the main energy storage device, and a PV module and a wind energy conversion system (WECS) including the micro wind turbine used as the clean and renewable energy based auxiliary power sources. A prototype of the battery/PV/wind hybrid power source has been constructed, and experimental verifications are presented that explicitly demonstrate utilizing the PV module and micro wind turbine adds 19.6 km to the cruising range of a PHEV with the weight of 1880 kg during two sunny days, and provides a higher power efficiency and speed of, respectively, 91.2% and 121 km/h compared to the normal operation of the PHEV. Highly accurate DC-link voltage regulation and producing an appropriate three-phase stator current for the traction motor by using pulse width modulation (PWM) technique are the other contributions of this work.

AB In Part I of this work, a comprehensive outdoor characterisation of a concentrating photovoltaic monomodule was presented where the importance of atmospheric parameters on the performance of such systems was highlighted. In this work, Part II, the power ratings of a concentrating photovoltaic monomodule are determined using different methods and filtering criteria that account for the spectrum. Spectral variations are considered to be a major parameter that contributes to the uncertainty of concentrating photovoltaic power ratings due to the dynamic behaviour of outdoor conditions. In order to address the sensitivity of such variations, Concentrator Standard Operating Conditions (CSOC) and Concentrator Standard Test Conditions (CSTC) power rating estimations are performed using different scenarios and compared with measurements obtained using a Helios 3198 solar simulator. The application of different methods and filtering criteria, in terms of the spectral matching ratio (SMR) of the middle to bottom subcell, exhibits differences of up to 3.64% and 1.37% for the CSOC and CSTC estimations respectively. The comparison with the CSTC power rating obtained indoors shows a difference of up to 8.45%; this is attributed to the tracking errors and also the temperature dependence of the refractive optics. The application of the spectral factor (SF) as filtering criterion reduces the CSTC power rating difference to 6.74% compared to the corresponding value obtained indoors. In addition, the CSOC power rating estimation using the SF filtering exhibits similar results to the standardised procedure using the SMR indices (within 1.21%).

AB Recycling waste cooking oil (WCO) for use in diesel engines offers a sustainable solution for ecological wellbeing and energy security. Diesel-WCO-alcohol ternary blends provide a straightforward and cost-effective opportunity to utilise both a bio-component & a recycled component to partially replace diesel and to reduce viscosity of WCO instead of expensive pre-heating and trans-esterification. Three bio-alcohols, n-propanol (Pr), n-butanol (Bu) and n-pentanol (Pe) were chosen for this purpose. An investigation was carried out to compare the effects of adding three bio-alcohols to form ternary blends with WCO and diesel (D) individually (D50-WC030-Pr20, D50-WC030-Bu20 and D50-WC030-Pe20) for optimum engine characteristics by employing a response surface methodology (RSM) based optimization using a 3-factor x 3-level full factorial experimental design. Three alcohols, three injection timings (23 degrees, 25 degrees and 27 degrees CA bTDC) and three EGR rates (10, 20 and 30%) were chosen as factors and their levels. Regression models were developed for NOx, smoke, HC, CO, BTE and BSFC and were found to be statistically significant. Interactive effects between injection timing and EGR for all blends were presented. Pentanol was found to be a suitable alcohol for this purpose as the ternary blend D50-WC030-Pe20 injected at 23 degrees CA bTDC at 15% EGR had the highest desirability. Confirmatory tests validated that the models developed were adequate and the error in prediction is within 6%.

AB Solar roads are emergent and huge energy source in traffic domains. To improve the energy utilization efficiency of a solar road, a novel solar-road and soil-regenerator hybrid energy system in combination with conventional photovoltaic-thermal and soil heat storage technology was proposed. A mathematical model of the solar-road and soil-regenerator hybrid energy system was developed, validated, and applied to evaluate the thermal storage and power generation performance of the proposed system in cold regions. The results indicated that for critical thermal storage temperatures of 20, 30, and 40 degrees C, the proposed system decreased maximum photovoltaic cell temperatures by 24.09, 25.84, and 24.42 degrees C and increased electrical efficiencies by 6.85, 6.68, and 4.53%, respectively, compared with conventional solar roads. By storing heat in the soil and elevating soil temperatures, the proposed system also increased the average borehole wall temperatures by 2.93, 2.26, 1.87 degrees C. The proposed system produced overall energy efficiencies of 48.42, 55.47, and 66.58%, while conventional solar road efficiencies approximate 10.75%.

AB Based on ERA-20C data available for the period 2008-2010, the potential of six onshore wind turbine installation scenarios to cover current electricity consumption at the national and global scale was studied. The technical wind energy potential was estimated using the recently developed, highly accurate Burr-Generalized Extreme Value mixture distribution. The installation scenarios were evaluated by varying wind farm efficiency, the concentration of wind turbines, and wind turbine siting strategy for wind turbine densities of 1-25% of the land area. With the systematic installation of wind turbines at the national scale and international coordination of energy distribution, wind energy production could match current electricity consumption in the 2030s assuming a tenfold increase in current expansion rate. However, the results greatly differ from country to country mainly because of the meteorological potential, the total area available for wind turbine installation, and the population size. In industrialized countries such as China, France, Germany, and Japan, either low average annual wind energy yield or the large population prevents complete coverage of electricity consumption by wind energy at low and moderate wind turbine density. In developing countries including Ethiopia, Sudan or Kenia, where wind energy potential is high and electricity consumption is low, expansion of wind energy could greatly improve electricity supply. It was found that 98 countries could cover their current electricity consumption by an installed capacity of 0.0734 MW/km(2). This installed capacity enables 73 countries to cover even a 100% increase of the current electricity consumption. Based on the range of evaluated scenarios, it is possible to estimate the upper and lower bounds of the technical potential predefined by the applied wind turbine densities.

AB Renewable energy is considered as a solution for mitigating energy crisis and environmental pollution. However, there are two main issues in techno-economic assessment of renewable energy resource: difficult to quantify assessment indicators and lack of a general indicator for multi-criteria evaluation. This study aims to develop a calculation methodology to quantify the techno-economic indicators including power generation, economic costs, incomes, and carbon emissions, through simulating the long-term implementation of solar, wind and biomass energy based renewable power systems. Moreover, by using normalization, weighting methods and Radar plot, all the indicators mentioned above are combined into a general evaluation indicator, which is able to provide a numerical result of multi-criteria quality evaluation of renewable energy resources. Hunan Province located in subtropical China where abundant of solar, wind and biomass energy resources, is studied as a case to present the evaluation methodology and its application. Through collecting the resource data of solar, wind and biomass energy and their facility costs data as the inputs, the long-term implementation of renewable power generation systems located in fourteen cities of Hunan Province are simulated; and then the numerical values of the general indicator are compared among different types of renewable energy resource. The general indicator evaluation results show that southern region including Yongzhou city have higher feasibility for wind power, while the eastern and northern areas including Loudi city have better feasibility of solar energy; for biomass energy resource assessment, the Huaihua system has the best feasibility while the Xiangtan system has the lowest among all the cities in Hunan province. The developed evaluation model and general indicator are able to provide a reference for investment decision making and subsidy policy optimizing.

AB The desiccant-enhanced dew point evaporative cooling system is proposed as a potential alternative for air conditioning. It enables independent control of the air humidity and temperature so that latent and sensible heat loads are judiciously decoupled. In this paper, we carried out a thermodynamic analysis on a hybrid membrane liquid desiccant dehumidification and dew point evaporative cooling system. A cross-flow membrane liquid desiccant dehumidifier and a counter-flow dew point evaporative cooler were developed and investigated. Experiments were conducted to demonstrate the ability of the dehumidifier and cooler to achieve sufficient moisture removal and temperature reduction. The supply air could be regulated to the suggested thermal comfort zone of 20.0-28.0 degrees C temperature with humidity ratio of below 12.0 g/kg. A detailed mathematical model was formulated by considering the momentum, continuity, energy and species equations. The model was able to predict well the experimental data with a maximum discrepancy of 5.0%. Key findings that emerged from this study include: (1) the proposed system was able to deliver the product air at 18.3 degrees C temperature and 10.9 g/kg humidity under nominal conditions; (2) the channel heights of the dehumidifier and cooler should be maintained at 2.0 and 3.0 mm, with their channel lengths at 0.2 and 0.6 m, respectively, to achieve thermal comfort conditions; and (3) a solution flow ratio of 2.7 with the membrane diffusion resistance not larger than 20 s/m achieved sufficient humidity reduction of more than 9.0 g/kg.

AB A novel sorption air conditioner for electric vehicles is presented, which is expected to reduce electricity consumption of on-board battery with a longer cruising mileage. This technology may be an alternative solution to conventional vapor compression air conditioner for current electric vehicles. Expanded natural graphite is selected in the development of composite sorbent. Performance of novel sorption air conditioner is analyzed based on sorption characteristic of composite sorbent, and a model electric car is chosen for detailed evaluation. It is indicated that sorption technology is able to be applied into electric vehicles. Energy density in winter and in summer ranges from 757 k.Pkg(-1) to 1980 k.l.kg(-1) and 387 k.J.kg(-1) to 990 k.l.kg(-1) whereas energy efficiency ranges from 0.34 to 0.82 and from 0.19 to 0.42. Also worth noting that the extra mass of sorption air conditioner system will have limited influence on cruising mileage of electric vehicles, which results in a reduction less than 4.3%. In winter, the highest saved cruising mileage by using novel sorption air conditioner is close to 100 km. Even the lowest saved mileage in summer is still able to reach 21 km, which is about 7.5% of the maximum mileage.

AB A novel Solar Geothermal Hybrid Electric Power Plant (SGHEPP) based on the hybridization of an existing binary Geothermal Electric Power Plant by adding a solar-powered steam-Rankine topping cycle is proposed. The proposed SGHEPP has several benefits. First, the hybridization scheme does not require the binary bottoming cycle to be physically modified or operated outside its design conditions. Second, the proposed SGHEPP has a higher turbine inlet temperature, which results in higher solar-to-electricity conversion efficiencies. Third, the daily energy production for the SGHEPP peaks on sunny summer days when electricity prices are generally highest. And fourth, the design reduces the consumption of geothermal resources, which can extend the useful life of declining and marginal geothermal fields. Annual simulations are run for a representative plant in southwestern Turkey and used to assess the plant's energetic, exergetic, and economic performance. The performance of four designs are compared that differ with respect to how the geothermal resources are managed and the size of the solar field. A representative design has an incremental solar efficiency of 12.2% and consumes up to 17% less brine than a similar stand-alone geothermal plant. The calculated solar based LCOE for each design is in the range of 163-172 USD MWh(-1).

AB Wind energy is attracting more attention with the growing demand for energy. However, the efficient development and utilization of wind energy are restricted due to the intermittency and randomness of wind speed. Although abundant investigations concerning wind speed forecasting have been conducted by numerous researchers, most of the studies merely attach importance to point forecasts, which cannot quantitatively characterize the uncertainties as developing intervals. In this study, a novel interval prediction architecture has been designed, aiming at constructing effective prediction intervals for a wind speed series, composed of a preprocessing module, a feature selection module, an optimization module, a forecast module and an evaluation module. The feature selection module, in cooperation with the preprocessing module, is developed to determine the optimal model input. Furthermore, the forecast module optimized by the optimization module is considered a predictor for giving prediction intervals. The experimental results shed light on the architecture that not only outperforms the benchmark models considered, but also has great potential for application to wind power systems.

AB The conventional CCHP systems often operate at part load and cause power surplus under the operation mode of power following thermal load. In order to improve the energy efficiency of CCHP systems, a novel combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system combined with compressed air energy storage (CAES) was proposed. However, the output power of CAES was probably not high due to the low temperature of high-pressure air at air turbine inlet. In this paper, solar energy was introduced to heat the high-pressure air from air storage cavern. For the further energy utilization of the air turbine exhaust with relatively high temperature, an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) was proposed to recover the heat carried by air turbine exhaust. To obtain the off-design characteristics of the proposed system, the typical off-design models of gas turbine, compressor and air turbine were built through the performance equations of each component. The sensitivity analysis on S-CAES with ORC system was investigated to evaluate the effects of several key parameters on its performances. The results show that the energy efficiency and exergy efficiency of S-CAES with ORC system reach 98.30% and 68.94% respectively, in a whole round trip cycle. A case study of the proposed system in a typical hotel building with 180,000 m(2) located in South China concludes that, compared with the conventional CCHP, the energy consumption can be reduced by 124.78 GJ, 33.82 GJ and 62.1 GJ and the average energy efficiency increased by 7.72%, 1.47% and 3.61% in summer, transition season and winter typical days, respectively.

AB Flexible thermoelectric generator became an attractive technology for its wide use especially for curved surfaces applications. This study proposes design of a flexible thermoelectric generator, which is part of a sensor and supplies required electrical power for human body application. The thermoelectric generator module has ink based thermoelements which are made of nano-carbon bismuth telluride materials. Flexible fins conduct the body heat to the thermoelectric uni-couples, extended fins exchange the heat from the cold side of the thermoelectric generator to the ambient. A fully developed one-dimensional steady-state numerical model including temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties of different materials is built to reveal basic characteristics and optimal design criteria of the thermoelectric generator. Results show that ambient temperature presents significant influence on thermoelectric generator performance, but thermal resistance from blood to skin surface and contact thermal resistance at skin surface has negligible influence. A very low air velocity, e.g. 0.01 m/s is enough to ensure a considerable temperature difference through the thermoelectric element. Increasing thermoelectric elements thickness and thermoelectric module row number in a proper range can significantly enhance thermoelectric generator performance. The maximum output power can reach 0.2 W/cm(2), which indicates the proposed design is promising for supplying human body sensors. In addition, the basic optimal design criteria of the flexible thermoelectric generator and its relative merits are discussed and presented.

AB The renewable energy has drawn increasingly attention for the utilization of energy in the worldwide, especially biomass and geothermal energy. The total biomass gasification usually leads to the higher exergy destruction and lower exergy efficiency of gasification process subsequently, and the flue gas at middle temperature (400 degrees C) is always used to generate domestic hot water from environment temperature to required temperature e.g. 55 degrees C, the relative large temperature difference leads to high exergy loss. For adopting ground source heat pump system to generate domestic hot water, relative high target temperature (e.g. 55 degrees C) always leads to the high compression ratio, which decreases the coefficient of performance (COP) of the ground source heat pump host. Therefore, so as to make a better use of biomass and increase the COP of ground source heat pump systems, a novel CHP system coupling biomass partial gasification and ground source heat pump is presented. It mainly consists of four parts: biomass partial gasification subsystem; gas turbine power generation subsystem; steam turbine power generation subsystem; and ground source heat pump subsystem. The main products of proposed system are electricity and domestic hot water (55 degrees C). The exergetic and exergoeconomic performance analysis of proposed system are investigated, and in a further way, the effects of several key system integrating parameters on system performance are also studied. The results show that the system exergy efficiency can be reached at about 13.65%. The main exergy destruction exists in gasifier and followed by char boiler, which accounts for 38% and 21.71% of total exergy destruction, respectively. Moreover, the unit cost of hot water, power generated by gas turbine and steam turbine are 92.5 $/GJ, 12.4 $/GJ and 23.9 $/GJ, respectively. The proposed CHP integration system is valuable to other advanced biomass and geothermal based multi-generation systems.

AB When the hydraulic excavator boom drops, the gravitational potential energy accumulated during the lifting process is converted into heat energy and dissipated through the throttling effect of hydraulic valve, which results in poor energy efficiency and higher temperature of hydraulic oil. A cooling system must be installed to lower the temperature, increasing the cost and complexity of the system. In order to solve the above problems, an integrated drive and energy recuperation system based on a three-chamber hydraulic cylinder is proposed. In the proposed system, one chamber of the three-chamber cylinder is directly connected to a hydraulic accumulator, storing and reusing the potential energy of the boom. The other two chambers are connected to the main driving circuit. The proposed system is first studied with an integrated co-simulation of the mechanical and hydraulic systems. Through the simulation, the energy saving performance of the new system is verified, and the initial pressure of the hydraulic accumulator is determined. In addition, the new system is tested on a 6-ton hydraulic excavator, and the results are compared with the ones of double-chamber hydraulic cylinder driving system. The test results show that with the proposed system, the energy consumption of the boom is reduced by 50.1% and the peak power of the power source is reduced by 64.9%. It is worth noting that the new method can be widely applied to all types of heavy lift device driven by hydraulic cylinders.

AB A main method to increase the solar energy utilization efficiency is to combine heat and power generation together. In this paper, a critical review of the literature on solar combined heat and power systems (CHP) is conducted, which includes solar photovoltaic/thermal systems, concentrated photovoltaic/thermal systems, and various combination with different solar collectors and applications. It shows that there are serious gaps in this field, which calls for more research. The modeling and analysis of the electrical parts of the CHP systems are not adequate, and there are limited studies on the economic and exergy assessments of the solar concentrating CHP systems. The solar collectors for combined CHP were focused on optimizing the performance of the maximum average useful power generation and minimum total heat transfer area, little environment impact analysis was conducted. Careful exergy, economic and environmental analysis on both electronic and thermal performance is suggested, especially for large CHP system. Also, further studies are recommend for investigating the hybrids of concentrating collectors with CHP, with considering the economic issues.

AB The direct-fired supercritical carbon dioxide power cycle not only has the potential of reaching high efficiency, but also achieves near 100% carbon capture in a more inherent and natural manner. A conceptual flow sheet of the direct-fired supercritical carbon dioxide power cycle that is coupled to the coal gasification process is built in this study. A detailed turbine cooling model is added to better assess the performance of the power plant. To investigate the effect of key cycle variables on the cycle performance and determine potential chances for efficiency improvement, a parametric study is conducted in this paper. The result shows that the turbine inlet temperature and turbine outlet pressure have significant effect on the cycle efficiency while the effect of the turbine inlet pressure is minor. The cycle efficiency is susceptible to the inlet condition of the carbon dioxide pump, which is the weakness of the supercritical carbon dioxide power cycle. The flow sheet and some of the cycle parameters are modified based on the conclusions drawn from the parametric study. The net efficiency of the power plant is calculated to be 38.87% (on lower heating value basis) at a turbine inlet temperature of 1200 degrees C, while capturing most of the carbon dioxide derived from combustion.

AB This study presents comparative energy and exergy analyses of a solar energy based integrated multi-generation system with two unique configurations of thermoelectric generators. System 1 considers an integration of the output of thermoelectric generators with the parabolic solar collectors. In system 2, the thermoelectric generators are incorporated between solar heat exchanger and organic Rankine cycle 1. The heat rejected at low temperature interface of the thermoelectric devices generates electricity through organic Rankine cycle 2. The electricity generated by the thermoelectric generators is used to operate an electrolyzer to produce hydrogen. The utilization of thermoelectric devices developed in system 2 enhances the energy and exergy efficiencies of overall multi-generation system and organic Rankine cycle 1. In addition to this, the net amount of work output by organic Rankine cycle 1 is also improved greatly in system 2. The design configurations of the thermal system and the influences of the operating conditions on the energy and exergy efficiencies of multigeneration/overall system and organic Rankine cycle are investigated. The present results show that an increase in the mass flow rate of solar heat transferring fluid improves the work rate by the turbines and thermoelectric generators appreciably. The proposed system has superior and unique features as compared to the corresponding conventional systems based on thermoelectric generation.

AB Ticks are economically and medically important ectoparasites due to the injuries inflicted through their bite, and their ability to transmit pathogens to humans, livestock, and wildlife. Whereas hard ticks have been intensively studied, little is known about soft ticks, even though they can also transmit pathogens, including African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) affecting domestic and wild suids or Borrelia bacteria causing tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) in humans. We thus developed a regional model to identify suitable spatial areas for a community of nine Ornithodoros tick species (O. erraticus, O. sonrai, O. alactagalis, O. nereensis, O. tholozani, O. papillipes, O. tartakovskyi, O. asperus, O. verrucosus), which may be of medical and veterinary importance in the Western Palearctic region. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis was used due to the relative scarcity of high-quality occurrence data. After an in-depth literature review on the ecological requirements of the selected tick community, five climate related factors appeared critical for feeding activity and tick development: (i) a spring temperature exceeding 10 degrees C to induce the end of winter soft tick quiescent period, (ii) a three-months summer temperature above 20 degrees C to allow tick physiological activities, (iii) annual precipitation ranging from 60 mm to 750 mm and, in very arid areas, (iv) dry seasons interrupted by small rain showers to maintain minimum moisture inside their habitat along the year or (v) residual water provided by perennial rivers near habitats. We deliberately chose not to include biological factors such as host availability or vegetation patterns. A sensitivity analysis was done by performing multiple runs of the model altering the environmental variables, their suitability function, and their attributed weights. To validate the models, we used 355 occurrence data points, complemented by random points within sampled ecoregions. All models indicated suitable areas in the Mediterranean Basin and semi desert areas in South-West and Central Asia. Most variability between models was observed along northern and southern edges of highly suitable areas. The predictions featured a relatively good accuracy with an average Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.779. These first models provide a useful tool for estimating the global distribution of Ornithodoros ticks and targeting their surveillance in the Western Palearctic region.

AB The aim of the present study was to evaluate the re-shedding of T. gondii oocysts in cats fed tissue cysts of homologous and heterologous strains 12, 24 and 36 months after the first infection. Thirteen cats were used in the present study and were divided into four groups: G1 (n = 2), G2 (n = 3), G3 (n = 5), and G4 (n = 3). Gl, G3 and G4 cats were infected with brain cysts of ME49 and G2 with TgDoveBr8, both genotype H strains of T. gondii. The G1 and G2 cats were re-infected after twelve months with brain cysts of VEG strain (genotype III), and G3 cats were re-infected with TgDoveBrl (genotype II). The G3 cats were re-infected a third time after 24 months from the second infection, and the G4 cats were re-infected 36 months after the initial infection with cysts of the VEG strain. The cats' feces were evaluated using fecal flotation and genotyped with PCR-RFLP. The serological responses for IgM, IgA and IgG were determined by ELISA. All cats shed oocysts after the initial infection. Only one G1 cat shed oocysts when re-infected after twelve months with the VEG strain. No G2 cats excreted oocysts after the second infection with VEG. G3 cats, when re-infected after twelve months with the TgDoveBrl strain, did not shed oocysts. However, when challenged after a third time with the VEG strain, three out of four cats shed oocysts. In the G4 group, when re-infected after thirty-six months with the VEG strain, two out of three cats shed oocysts. All oocyst samples were genotyped and characterized as the same genotype from the inoculum. Protection against oocyst re-excretion occurred in 90%, 25%, and 33.4% of cats after 12, 24, and 36 months from the initial infection, respectively. Therefore, the environmental contamination by oocysts from re-infected adult cats is only 30% lower than from kittens. In conclusion, the excretion of T. gondii oocysts was higher in experimentally re-infected cats throughout the years, especially when a heterologous strain was used.

AB Soluble parasite antigens (SPA) in supernatants of in vitro cultures of Babesia canis can be used to vaccinate dogs against virulent B. canis infection. The moment that immunity becomes apparent coincides with the appearance of antibodies against SPA in the serum of the vaccinated animals. This so-called vaccination-challenge serum (VC-serum) was used to precipitate antigens from B. cants culture supernatants in agarose gels. This antigen preparation was then used to analyse the reactivity of sera from vaccinated dogs on western blots.
   Results: showed that the first appearance of antibody reactivity against a protein that migrated at the 39 kDa position in SDS-PAGE gels was associated with the moment vaccinated dogs started to recover from a virulent challenge infection. In addition, pulse-chase experiments revealed that a 39-40 kDa doublet was released into the supernatant of B. canis cultures starting 15 min after the chase. This doublet was specifically precipitated by VC-serum, thus corroborating that the 39-40 kDa doublet in SPA preparations was of parasite origin. Partial amino acid sequencing allowed the discovery of the gene that encoded the 39-40 kDa doublet (canine Babesia antigen; CBA). The full-length gene was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The recombinant CBA protein (rCBA) was recognized by VC-serum, and antibodies against rCBA precipitated the 39 kDa antigen of SPA preparations and of merozoites of B. canis. In addition, anti-rCBA serum reacted with the surface of B. canis merozoites (but not with B. rossi merozoites) in immunofluorescence. Vaccination of dogs with rCBA induced antibodies against rCBA, which recognized B. canis merozoites. Vaccinated dogs were protected against virulent challenge infection by limiting parasite proliferation. As a result, the development of clinical signs was prevented and the animals self-cured. In contrast, six out of seven non-vaccinated control dogs developed relatively high parasitaemia and serious clinical signs associated with poor tissue perfusion. This antigen can be used to replace the SPA antigen in the conventional B. canis vaccines, which eliminates the need for dog blood and serum for vaccine production.

AB Animal Trypanosomiasis (AT) is one of the most important problems in the Colombian livestock industry reducing its production around 30%. Caribbean and Orinoquia regions play a significant role in the development of this industry, having about 6.9 million cattle and 113,000 buffaloes. Considering the paucity in studies to understand the epidemiological features and control of AT in Colombia, the present study reports the seasonal transmission patterns and phylogeographic traits of the causal agents of AT in cattle and buffaloes from these regions.
   Between 2014 and 2016, a three-point longitudinal survey was designed to evaluate the mentioned characteristics. Molecular analysis in cattle showed an AT prevalence of 39.2% (T theileri 38.6%, T. evansi 6.7% and T. vivax 0.2%), with higher values during wet and late wet seasons, while in buffaloes the prevalence was 28.2% (T. theileri 28.2% and T. evansi 1.3%), with higher values during the dry season. Additionally, variables such as tabanid abundance, vector control, breeding system, age and anemia signs were significantly associated with AT prevalence (P < 0.05). Only T. theileri infection was higher in cattle with anemia signs than those with normal packed cell volume. Finally, phylogeographic analysis revealed that Colombian T. theileri isolates were associated to specific host genotypes IA and IIB, described worldwide; T. vivax isolates were related to the genotype from West Africa; while T evansi isolates are related to the South American genotypes and to new genotypes. This is the first longitudinal survey that evaluates through molecular methods, the infection of Trypanosoma spp. in two important livestock regions from Colombia, showing that the clinical effects and prevalence of these trypanosomes in cattle and buffaloes are modulated by seasonal variations, host factors, and parasite traits. The results suggest that these factors have to be taken into account to successfully control AT in these regions.

AB This work aims to identify and quantify the percentage of Rickettsia spp., Ehrlichia spp., Babesia spp. and Hepatozoon spp. positive pet dogs, and to identify ticks collected on these animals in the state of Espirito Santo, in the Southeast region of Brazil. The study included 378 dogs, 226 females and 152 males, of various breeds and ages (mean age of 4.1 years). All animals were examined for ticks, and whole blood was collected and processed by conventional PCR protocols for Babesia spp., Anaplasmataceae, Hepatozoon spp. and by real-time PCR for Ehrlichia canis. Of the 378 dogs examined, 157 (41.53%) had ticks at the time of the study, which were identified as R. sanguineus s.l. in 154 animals (98.10%), Amblyomma ovale in one animal (0.63%), and Amblyomma sculptum in 2 animals (1.27%). In the PCR for Babesia spp., 5 animals (1.32%) were positive, producing DNA sequences 100% identical to Babesia vogeli. For Anaplasmataceae, 34 animals (9%) were positive, 10 of which generated DNA sequences 100% similar to Ehrlichia canis. The other 24 samples generated fragments 100% identical to Anaplasma platys. In the PCR for Hepatozoon spp, 39 animals (10.31%) were positive, producing sequences 100% identical to Hepatozoon canis. Finally, in the real-time PCR specific for E. canis, 28 animals (7.40%) were positive. Coinfection with 2 or 3 agents was observed in 20 animals (5.29%). Of the 378 dogs sampled, 312 were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for E. canis and five species of Rickettsia (R. rickettsii, R. parkeri, R. amblyommatis, R. rhipicephali and R. bellii). Among them, 71 dogs (22.75%) had a positive reaction for E. canis and 16 dogs (5.13%) had antibody titers higher than 64 to at least one Rickettsia species, 5 of them (1.60%) to R. rickettsii. Samples of blood were collected from 10 equines in the regions where dogs were found with positive serology for any one of the Rickettsia sp. tested. In the municipality of Vila Velha, two equines were positive for R. bellii with inverse titers of 64 and 128. These results indicate that tick-transmitted agents, such as E. canis, A. platys, B. vogeli, H. canis, and several spotted fever group Rickettsia are circulating in the canine population of the Brazilian state of Espirito Santo.

AB Infections with the zoonotic endoparasite Giardia duodenalis are widely spread among dogs and cats worldwide. Since the question whether the infection might be transmitted from domestic animals to their owners is still an important topic, a reliable detection of patent Giardia infections and the determination of the associated Giardia assemblages is of major concern. The objectives of the present study were to determine the prevalence of Giardia infections in dogs and cats living in Germany using different diagnostic tests and to identify the Giardia assemblages of infected animals. Furthermore, a possible correlation of coinfections with other endoparasites was analysed. All samples were investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), merthiolate-iodine-formalin concentration technique (MIFC) and zinc chloride flotation. ELISA-positive samples were additionally screened with a direct immunofluorescence assay (IFA), Faecal DNA was extracted from all Giardia cyst-positive samples and used for multilocus sequence typing with nested PCRs targeting the following gene loci: SSU rRNA (SSU), glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) and triosephosphate isomerase (tpi). Samples from dogs and cats tested positive for Giardia coproantigen (ELISA) in 30.6% and 17.9%, respectively. The MIFC technique revealed Giardia cysts in 33.9% of canine and in 34.6% of feline ELISA-positive samples, while using IFA, cysts were present in 90.4% of canine and in 76.9% of feline ELISA-positive samples. Coinfections with other endoparasites besides Giardia were found in both dogs and cats, yet a statistically significant correlation could solely be drawn for the canine samples. The success rate of the different PCR protocols varied between 23.1% (tpi) and 91.3% (SSU) for dogs and between 25.0% (gdh) and 90.0% (SSU) for cats. Dog-specific Giardia assemblages C and D were detected in 42 and 55 canine isolates, respectively. The cat-specific Giardia assemblage F was detected in 14 feline isolates. Two canine and two feline samples harboured the zoonotic assemblage A. According to the results of the study, Giardia is a common endoparasite in dogs and cats from Germany. The exclusive application of MIFC is insufficient for a reliable identification of patent Giardia infections since the IFA revealed a higher sensitivity for the detection of Giardia cysts in feline and canine faecal samples. Even though the majority of investigated animals harboured the species-specific Giardia assemblages C, D and F, a zoonotic potential arising from assemblage A could not be excluded.

AB There is an increasing interest in the use of combination anthelmintic products for the control of intestinal nematode parasites of livestock. These products are seen as attractive options for parasite control in the face of increasing levels of resistance to the different anthelmintic drug classes, as well as a means to slow the rate at which resistance develops to the individual components of the combination. With the recent introduction of an anthelmintic combination product containing abamectin and monepantel (at 1:12.5), we were interested in measuring the response of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant isolates of Haemonchus contortus to these two drugs alone and in combination, using larval development assays. The GWBII isolate showed resistance to abamectin (12-fold) alongside susceptibility to monepantel. The resistance ratio was reduced from 12- to 3.2 fold when the two drugs were combined. The MPL-R isolate was resistant to both drugs, with resistance factors of 6-fold towards abamectin, and 10.6- and 1008-fold towards monepantel in two sub-populations present in the isolate. This isolate showed 6.4-fold resistance to the drug combination. Hence, for both GWBII and MPL-R, the level of resistance towards the combination was reduced compared to the resistance towards abamectin or monepantel alone, respectively, but was not abolished. However, for GWBII, this in vitro resistance to the drug combination would be expected to have no impact on the in vivo efficacy of the combination drench product as the isolate is resistant to only the abamectin component of the drench, with monepantel remaining effective. On the other hand, the observed in vitro resistance to the combination shown by the MPL-R isolate is derived from significant levels of resistance towards both components separately, and hence may impact on in vivo efficacy of the combination. Isobologram analysis did not find any evidence for a synergistic interaction between the two drugs in larval development assays. We examined the predicted effects of varying the abamectin:monepantel ratio in drug combinations, assuming that the two drugs acted in an additive fashion. For GWBII, resistance to the drug combination was reduced to almost zero as the abamectin:monepantel ratio increased from 1:12.5 to 1:100, reflecting its resistance to only the abamectin component of the combination. For MPL-R, on the other hand, the resistance increased as the relative proportion of monepantel in the combination was increased, reflecting the extreme level of in vitro resistance shown by this isolate to monepantel.

AB There is a need to investigate new methods of controlling cyathostomins in horses due to increasing anthelmintic resistance amongst these parasites. In a previous study we identified the Australian plant Alectryon oleifolius as having anthelmintic activity towards cyathostomins. This study aimed to isolate and identify the bioactive compound(s) responsible for all or part of this anthelmintic activity and quantify its activity in vitro. The condensed tannin procyanidin A2 was isolated from the plant through a process of bioassay guided fractionation and identified using 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. Procyanidin A2 demonstrated significant anthelmintic activity in larval development assays, completely inhibiting development from egg to third larval stage at concentrations as low as 501.1 mu/mL and having an IC50 value of 12.6 mu g/mL. Procyanidin A2 also significantly inhibited larval migration at concentrations of 25 mu g/mL. This study indicates that procyanidin A2 is the principal anthelmintic compound in extracts from A. oleifolius, and further highlights the potential for the use of this plant as a component of cyathostomin control programs in the future.

AB Neospora caninum is one of the main agents that causes abortions in cattle worldwide. However, little is known about the pathogenesis of neosporosis in small ruminants, especially goats. Gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) have been used as a model for neosporosis, and this species is highly susceptible to infection by bovine N. caninum strains. The present study aimed to evaluate the susceptibility of gerbils to a N. caninum isolate from goats. The placentas were obtained from naturally infected goats, that presented with mild to severe lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic infiltrate, foci of necrosis, calcification and protozoan-like structures. Immunosuppressed gerbils bioassayed with N. caninum-infected placental tissues showed severe neurological signs. Microscopic lesions in these gerbils were characterized by encephalitis, myocarditis, myositis and pancreatitis. These lesions were often associated with a small to moderate number of N. caninum tachyzoites, confirmed by immunohistochemistry and PCR. This is the first report showing that goat N. caninum strains could infect immunocompetent gerbils and cause severe lesions and clinical signs in immunosuppressed gerbils.

AB Coccidiosis is one of the most important protozoal diseases of the poultry industry, inflicting heavy economic losses in the form of high mortality and morbidity in affected birds. Under these circumstances, the development of nonchemical consumer-friendly strategies for its effective control is of paramount importance. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) bagasse-derived polysaccharides as native immunomodulatory and anticoccidial agents in commercial broilers. Polysaccharides were recovered from sugarcane bagasse (PSCB) and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Five different sugars including melezitose, maltose, glucose, mannose, and fructose were detected in hydrolyzed solution of PSCB. The isolated PSCB were orally administered to the broilers in three graded doses ranging from 10 to 50 mg/kg of body weight/day for 3 consecutive days, i.e., fifth through seventh days of life. Results showed significantly enhanced (p < 0.05) lymphoproliferative and humoral responses to T-cell mitogen (PHA-P) and sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) in PSCB-administered chickens. In a challenge experiment, percent protection and daily weight gains were significantly higher (p < 0.05), whereas mean oocyst counts and lesion scores were lower (p < 0.05) in PSCB-administered chickens as compared to control. ELISA showed that PSCB significantly enhanced (p < 0.05) antibody titers against the Eimeria species used for the induction of infection in chickens of PSCB-administered and control groups. In conclusion, PSCB showed the potential to modulate the immune responses in industrial broiler chickens with subsequent protection against coccidial infection.

AB Cystic echinococcosis/hydatidosis is an important cosmopolitan zoonotic disease that causes large economic losses and human suffering. The larval stages of Echinococcus granulosus are the etiological agents of cystic echinococcosis that showed different genotypes in different regions in the world. The present study was aimed at the detection of E. granulosus strains circulating in two cities from north of Iraq (Kirkuk and Sulaimania). A total of 47 specimens of hydatid cysts were collected from patients and from different domestic intermediate hosts including cattle, sheep, goat and buffalo from slaughterhouses. Molecular characterization was performed by direct sequencing of the mitochondria] DNA (mtDNA) genes coding for the cytochrome c oxidase 1 (cox1) and the small subunit ribosomal RNA (rmS). The results showed a high prevalence for the sheep strain (G1), an isolated finding of the buffalo strain (G3) and the presence of seven and three different microvariants for cox1 and rrnS, respectively. This is the first contribution on molecular genotyping of E. granulosus in Iraq with the observation of genotypes other than G1.

AB Body weight gain (BWG) and gastrointestinal nematode challenge (GIN) were investigated in two genetically diverse groups of cattle. Thirty-two dairy calves (D = Swedish Red/Holstein) and 31 dairy x beef crosses (C = Swedish Red/Holstein x Charolais) pairwise matched by dam breed and birth dates, were monitored for =20 weeks on a pasture grazed by cattle in the previous year. At turn-out, animals (between 6 and 12 months age) from each genotype were either infected with 5000 third stage (L3) Ostertagia ostertagi (50%) and Cooperia oncophora (50%) larvae (H, high-exposure); or treated monthly with 0.5 mg ivermectin (Noromectin (R) Pour-on) per kg bodyweight to remove worms ingested (L, low-exposure). Animals were weighed every fortnight and individual BWG was calculated. Faecal and blood samples were collected every four weeks throughout the experiment for nematode faecal egg counts (FEC) and larvae cultures and serum pepsinogen concentrations (SPC), respectively. Nematode eggs were observed 29 days post turn-out in both H groups. FEC peaked to around 200 eggs per gram (epg) on days 58 and 85 respectively in both H groups. FEC were also observed in the L groups at the same time, but mean epg remained very low (< 20 epg) and constituted exclusively of C. oncophora. Although, there was no significant difference in SPC values in animals of the different genotypes, ten animals of CH showed a SPC > 3.5 IU tyrosine whereas only six DH animals reached similar pepsinogen levels. The level of infection and L) significantly affected BWG in both genotypes. Even though there was no statistically significant genotype (C or D) x treatment (H or L) interaction, there was a larger difference in body weight of H and L in C (37 kg) compared to D (17 kg) genotypes at the end of the experiment. Our data collectively support the view crossbred (C) animals experience the impact of gastrointestinal parasitism more severely compared to pure dairy (D) first season grazers. The mechanisms that underpin this remains speculative.

AB Neospora caninum is a member of Apicomplexa phylum, the causative agent of neosporosis. The neosporosis combat is not well established and several strategies related to vaccine, chemotherapy and immune modulation are under development. In this work, we evaluated the effects of artemisinin (Art), methylene blue (MB) and pyrimethamine (Pyr) alone or associated, on N. caninum proliferation and elimination using LacZ tagged tachyzoites. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) production after incubation with Art were also performed. Our results indicate that combinations of classical antimalarial drugs improve the parasite control, allowing the use of three drugs in a single dose. Additionally, artemisinin demonstrated distinct ROS production patterns in intra and extracellular N. caninum forms. The drug repurposing appears as a suitable approach, allowing a fast and safe method to evaluate old drugs but novel candidates against neosporosis.

AB Celastrol (CST) is a promising natural drug of herbal origin that gained a great interest in the recent years by virtue of its wide variety of pharmacological actions. Nowadays, CST is extensively studied as a natural anticancer surrogate with a potential activity against various types of cancers. However, CST suffers from many limitations that handicapped its clinical utility such as limited aqueous solubility and poor gastrointestinal absorption which resulted into its low oral bioavailability. This work spotlights, for the first time, development of self-assembled phytosomal nanocarriers (CST-PHY) for improving CST solubility and oral bioavailability. First CST-phospholipid complex was prepared by a simple solvent evaporation technique. Formation of CST-phospholipid complex was confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), infrared spectroscopy (IR), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and partition coefficient determination. After dispersion into deionized water, CST-phospholipid complex was self-assembled to form CST-PHY. The optimized CST-PHY demonstrated a nanometric particle size of 178.4 +/- 7.07 nm and a negative zeta potential of -38.7 +/- 3.61 mV. Comparative in-vitro release study showed the ability of phytosomes to significantly enhance CST release compared with crude drug and physical mixture. Pharmacokinetic studies in rabbits revealed significant improvement in CST-PHY oral bioavailability compared with crude CST evidenced by 4-fold increase in AUC(0-8) and 5-fold increase in C-max of CST-PHY compared with crude CST. Conclusively, the results confirmed the potential of phytosomal nanocarriers to improve CST oral delivery paving the way for its use for oral cancer therapy.

AB Biopolymers have rarely been used so far as carriers in the formulation of amorphous solid dispersions (ASD) to overcome poor solubility of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). In an attempt to enlarge our knowledge on this topic, gelatin, type 50PS was selected. A screening study was initiated in which twelve structurally different poorly soluble biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS) Class II drugs (carbamazepine, cinnarizine, diazepam, itraconazole, nifedipine, indomethacin, darunavir (ethanolate), ritonavir, fenofibrate, griseofulvin, ketoconazole and naproxen) were selected for evaluation. Solid dispersions of five different drug loadings of these twelve compounds were prepared by lyophilization and evaluated for their solid state properties by mDSC and XR(P) D, and in vitro dissolution performance. Even without any process optimization it was possible to form either fully amorphous or partially amorphous systems, depending on the API and API to carrier ratio. Hence in this respect, gelatin 50PS behaves as any other carrier. Dissolution of the API from the solid dispersions significantly exceeded that of their crystalline counterparts. This study shows the potential of gelatin as a carrier to formulate amorphous solid dispersions.

AB In the present study, we have synthesized mixed cuprous/copper oxide nanosuspensions by metallosurfactant based microemulsion technique. Three metallosurfactants were synthesized which includes two non-ionic double chained metallosurfactants with C-12, C-16 chains with coordinated copper i.e. Cudda and Cuhexa, respectively. Another cationic double chained metallosurfactant with loosely bound metal (Cuctac) was also prepared. The prepared metallocomplexes were characterized using FTIR, elemental analysis, and NMR. The effect of the position of metallosurfactant in microemulsion on the fabrication and properties of nanosuspensions was elucidated. In this method, no external reducing agent and capping agent were added and tween 80 acted both as reducing and stabilizing agent for the nanoparticles. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized and it was observed that mixed copper and cuprous oxide particles are present in colloidal suspension for all the three studied metallosurfactants. The kinetics of formation of mixed copper/cuprous oxide nanosuspensions (Ns) and their stability was estimated using Uv-visible spectroscopy. Further, the binding and interactions of copper nanosuspensions with calf Thymus DNA (CT-DNA) were assessed using Uv-vis spectroscopy, circular dichroism and gel electrophoresis. Additionally, the antioxidant activity of the Cu Ns was checked using DPPH assay. The role of positive charge on nanoparticles as evaluated from Zeta potential was responsible for DNA affinity. The DNA conformational changes in the presence of nanosuspensions and relevant scavengers were investigated. Further, the anti-proliferative activity of copper Ns was assessed using HeLa cells and Cuhexa derived Ns were proved to be active with highest activity at a low concentration and were nontoxic towards normal cell lines. In summary, this work demonstrates a softer approach for the synthesis of copper nanosuspensions with a size range of 2-5 nm and evaluated the role of type and structure of metallosurfactant on size, stability of particles and anti-proliferative activity.

AB Osteoporosis treatment with PTH 1-34 injections significantly reduces the incidence of bone fracture. Potential further reductions in fracture rate should be observed through nasal spray delivery to address the poor compliance associated with patient dislike of repeated PTH 1-34 subcutaneous injections. In vitro human osteoblast-like Saos-2 cell intracellular cAMP levels were used to define PTH 1-34 nasal spray formulation bioactivity. The chemically synthesised PTH 1-34 had an EC50 of 0.76 nM. Absorption enhancers polyethylene glycol (15)-hy-droxystearate (Solutol (R) HS15), poloxamer 407, chitosan or sodium hyaluronate did not diminish the bioactivity of PTH 1-34 within an in vitro cell culture model (p> 0.05). We also demonstrated the effectiveness of the transmucosal absorption enhancer Solutol (R) HS15 in a nasal spray formulation using a preclinical pharmacokinetic model. In Sprague-Dawley rats without the absorption enhancer the uptake of PTH 1-34 into the blood via intranasal delivery produced a Cmax of 2.1 +/- 0.5 ng/ml compared to 13.7 +/- 1.6 ng/ml with Solutol (R) HS15 enhancer (p = 0.016) and a Cmax14.8 +/- 8 ng/ml in subcutaneous injections. Together these data illustrate that the nasal spray formulation bioactivity in vitro is not affected by the nasal spray absorption enhancers investigated, and the Solutol (R) HS15 nasal spray formulation had an equivalent pharmacokinetic profile to subcutaneous injection in the rat model. The Solutol (R) HS15 formulation therefore demonstrated potential as a PTH 1-34 nasal spray formulation for the treatment of osteoporosis.

In three cases, namely carbamazepine-NaTC, indomethacin-NaTC and mefenamic acid-NaTC, significant dissolution advantages over the crystalline drugs were observed, both for the freshly prepared samples and after storage for seven months. To understand the increased physical stability, infrared-, near-infrared and Raman spectroscopic studies were carried out. The effectiveness of NaTC as a coformer in a diverse range of coamorphous systems is attributed to its awkward molecular shape that hampers recrystallization and phase separation and its propensity to form a range of similar, yet different drug-coformer hydrogen bonding arrangements.

TI Thioredoxin-albumin fusion protein prevents copper enhanced zinc-induced

AB Zinc (Zn) is a co-factor for a vast number of enzymes, and functions as a regulator for immune mechanism and protein synthesis. However, excessive Zn release induced in pathological situations such as stroke or transient global ischemia is toxic. Previously, we demonstrated that the interaction of Zn and copper (Cu) is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Furthermore, oxidative stress has been shown to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of various metal ions induced neuronal death. Thioredoxin-Albumin fusion (HSA-Trx) is a derivative of thioredoxin (Trx), an antioxidative protein, with improved plasma retention and stability of Trx. In this study, we examined the effect of HSA-Trx on Cu2+/Zn2+-induced neurotoxicity. Firstly, HSA-Trx was found to clearly suppress Cu2+/Zn2+-induced neuronal cell death in mouse hypothalamic neuronal cells (GT1-7 cells). Moreover, HSA-Trx markedly suppressed Cu2+/Zn2+-induced ROS production and the expression of oxidative stress related genes, such as heme oxygenase-1. In contrast, HSA-Trx did not affect the intracellular levels of both Cu2+ and Zn2+ after Cu2+/Zn2+ treatment. Finally, HSA-Trx was found to significantly suppress endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response induced by Cu2+/Zn2+ treatment in a dose dependent manner. These results suggest that HSA-Trx counteracted Cu2+/Zn2+-induced neurotoxicity by suppressing the production of ROS via interfering the related gene expressions, in addition to the highly possible radical scavenging activity of the fusion protein. Based on these findings, HSA-Trx has great potential as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of refractory neurological diseases.

AB Oral bioavailability of the anti-osteoporotic drug alendronate (AL) is limited to <= 1% due to unfavorable physicochemical properties. To augment absorption across the gastrointestinal mucosa, an ion pair complex between AL and polyethyleneimine (PEI) was formed and incorporated into nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) using a modified solvent injection method. When compared to free AL, ion pairing with PEI increased drug encapsulation efficiency in NLCs from 10% to 87%. Drug release from NLCs measured in vitro using fasted state simulated intestinal fluid, pH 6.5 (FaSSIF-V2) was significantly delayed after PEI complexation. Stability of AL/PEI was pH-dependent resulting in 10-fold faster dissociation of AL in FaSSIF-V2 than measured at pH 7.4. Intestinal permeation properties estimated in vitro across Caco-2 cell monolayers revealed a 3-fold greater flux of AL encapsulated as hydrophobic ion complex in NLCs when compared to AL solution (P-app= 8.43 +/- 0.14x10(-6) cm/s and vs. 2.76 +/- 0.42x10(-6) cm/s). Cellular safety of AL/PEI-containing NLCs was demonstrated up to an equivalent AL concentration of 2.5 mM. These results suggest that encapsulation of AL/PEI in NLCs appears a viable drug delivery strategy for augmenting oral bioavailability of this clinically relevant bisphosphonate drug and, simultaneously, increase gastrointestinal safety.

AB Niclosamide is a promising antitumor agent, but its low aqueous solubility places limit on its antitumor efficacy. The aim of this study was to improve the solubility and dissolution of niclosamide through using octenylsuccinate hydroxypropyl phytoglycogen (OHPP), an amphiphilic dendrimer-like biopolymer. The niclosamide-OHPP solid dispersion (niclo-OHPP SD) was prepared and characterized in terms of crystallinity, molecular interactions, solubility and dissolution profile, in-vitro antitumor efficacy, and in-vitro transdermal amount. Xray powder diffraction analysis showed the amorphous state of niclosamide in niclo-OHPP SD. FTIR showed the formation of hydrogen bonding between niclosamide and OHPP. Solubility of niclosamide with niclo-OHPP SD was about 11,914 times that of niclosamide alone, and 61% of niclosamide with niclo-OHPP SD dissolved in 3 h upon dissolution. Against three cancer cell lines, cytotoxicity assays indicated greater inhibition by using nicloOHPP SD than by using DMSO-assisted niclosamide solution. The cumulative transdermal amount of niclosamide with niclo-OHPP SD was 5.3 times that with niclosamide alone. This study showed that the use of OHPP could provide strong support for the development of niclosamide-based drug formulations.

AB The purpose of this research was to determine acyclovir (ACV) acidic degradation kinetics which is relevant to gastric retentive device product design. A stability-indicating method revealed two unknown degradation products which have been identified by mass spectrometry as ACV and guanine formaldehyde adducts. In addition to the formation of these adducts, a proposed degradation scheme identifies the formation of methyl acetal ethylene glycol, formaldehyde, ethylene glycol, and guanine as additional ACV degradation products. pH-rate profiles were explained by using a rate law which assumed acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of protonated and un-protonated ACV. The predicted and observed rate constants were in good agreement. Data-driven excipient selection recommendations were based on the chemical kinetic study results, degradation scheme, and pH-rate profiles. The average activation energy for the degradation reaction was determined to be 31.3 +/- 1.6 kcal/mol. The predicted ACV t(90%) at 37 degrees C and pH 1.2 was calculated to be 7.2 days. As a first approximation, this suggests that ACV gastric retentive devices designed to deliver drug for 7 days should have acceptable drug product stability in the stomach.

AB Cationic polymers have been widely used as one of the most promising non-viral vehicles for gene delivery due to their potential safety and ease of large-scale production. Here, we report the design and synthesis of a series of novel biodegradable fluorinated poly(beta-amino ester) s (FPBAEs) by simple Michael-addition reaction as safe and efficient gene carrier. The results of transfection efficacy assay demonstrated the optimal FPBAE could mediated much higher GFP expression than the commercial transfection agents, polyethyleneimine (PEI, M-w = 25K) and Lipo 2000, as well as the non-fluorinated poly(beta-amino ester) s (PBAE) on both HeLa and HEK-293T cell lines (higher than 70 and 90%, respectively), which was largely attributed to fluorination. Moreover, MTT and hemolysis assay indicated a preferable biocompatibility of FPBAE compared with PEI 25K owing to the low molecular weight and the presence of cleavable ester bonds. Taken together, the novel polymer FPBAE with both excellent gene transfection efficacy and much lower toxicity could serve as a desirable gene vector.

AB Ampholytic starch derivatives are proposed as a new class of excipients carrying simultaneously anionic carboxymethyl (CM) and cationic aminoethyl (AE) groups on starch (St) polymeric chains. Three different types of derivatives were obtained by using the same reagents and varying only the order of their addition in the reaction medium: in one step method (OS) the two reactants were added simultaneously, whereas in two steps method (TS) either CMSt or AESt were prepared separately in the first step, followed by subsequent addition of the second reactant. It was found that all ampholytic derivatives were able to generate monolithic tablets by direct compression and allowed 60% loading of acidic (Acetylsalicylic acid), basic (Metformin), zwitterion (Mesalamine) or neutral (Acetaminophen) as drug models. The in vitro dissolution tests followed for 2 h in SGF and then in SIF, showed that the mentioned starch derivatives were stabilized by self-assembling and generated matrices able to control the release of drugs for about 24 h. The addition order of reagents has an impact on ampholytic starch properties offering thus a high versatility of this new class of starch excipients that can be tailored for challenging formulations with high dosages of several drugs.

AB Current topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) showed marginal efficacy in treatment of musculoskeletal disorders due to their fast clearance by skin blood flow and thus little direct penetration into the underlying muscle and joint tissues. Using ketoprofen (Kt) as a model NSAID and converting it to a cationic ester prodrug ketoprofen choline chloride (KCC), this study was to investigate the iontophoresis delivery of the prodrug KCC for improving the drug retention in the skin and the direct penetration into underlying tissues. From in vitro flux study, anodal iontophoresis of KCC showed 5 times higher flux than cathodal iontophoresis of Kt across human epidermis skin, and also 1.5 times higher across full thickness rat skin. From in situ dual agar gel model rat study, anodal iontophoresis of KCC showed 35 times more drug penetrating across the live skin into underlying agar gel and 22 times more drug retained in the skin than those from cathodal iontophoresis of Kt. Co-iontophoresis of a vasoconstrictor phenylephrine with KCC did not show better result than the iontophoresis of KCC alone. Overall, iontophoresis delivery of the cationic prodrug KCC showed great potential for direct penetration into local tissues underneath the skin.

AB The bioavailability of poorly-water-soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) can be significantly improved by so-called amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs). However, the long-term stability of ASDs might be impaired by API recrystallization and/or amorphous phase separation (APS). So far, no methods have been reported to quantify APS in ASDs. In this work, phase-separation kinetics as well as the compositions of the two amorphous phases evolving due to APS were quantitatively determined for the first time using confocal Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectra were evaluated via non-linear multivariate Indirect Hard Modeling and verified by differential scanning calorimetry and hot-stage microscopy. APS in water-free ASDs of ibuprofen and poly (DL-lactic- co-glycolic acid) was investigated considering the influence of temperature and polymer architecture (linear vs. star-shaped). Water absorbed at 40 degrees C and 75% relative humidity (RH) promotes APS which was quantified for formulations of felodipine/poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) and ibuprofen/poly(vinyl pyrrolidone).

AB The World Health Organization encourages "the development of oral formulations to simplify their transport, storage and administration in poor countries", and to "facilitate an effective immunization program to prevent sexually transmitted hepatitis B". Thus, two distinct and promising delivery systems were developed: recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) encapsulated into alginate-coated chitosan particles (AlgChiPs) and into glucan particles (GPs) mainly composed of beta-1,3-D-glucan. In vitro preliminary studies showed that both could be internalized by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and murine Peyer's patches, an imperative aspect regarding oral immunization. Chitosan particles (ChiPs) have shown interesting immunostimulating properties as mast cells activators. Vaccination studies reveal that three oral immunizations induced serum anti-HBsAg Immunoglobulin G (IgG) in 60 % of the animals and anti-HBsAg secretory IgA in faeces for both formulations. When subcutaneous (SC) priming was done, followed by two oral boosts, all mice were responder and much higher serum anti-HBsAg IgG titers were observed, besides mucosal protective immunity.

AB Orodispersible films have been described as new beneficial dosage forms for special patient populations. Due to various production settings, different requirements on film formulations are required for non-continuous and continuous manufacturing. In this study, a continuous coating machine was qualified in regards of the process conditions for film compositions and their effects on the formed films. To investigate differences between both manufacturing processes, various film formulations of hydrochlorothiazide and hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) or hydroxypropylmethycellulose (HPMC) as film formers were produced and the resulting films were characterized.
   The qualification of the continuously operating coating machine reveals no uniform heat distribution during drying. Coating solutions for continuous manufacturing should provide at least a dynamic viscosity of 1 Pa*s (wet film thickness of 500 mu m, velocity of 15.9 cm/min). HPC films contain higher residuals of ethanol or acetone in bench-scale than in continuous production mode. Continuous production lead to lower drug content of the films. All continuously produced films disintegrate within less than 30s. There are observed significant effects of the production process on the film characteristics. When transferring film manufacturing from lab-scale to continuous mode, film compositions, processing conditions and suitable characterization methods have to be carefully selected and adopted.

AB Berberine chloride (BER) is an antineoplastic phytomedicine that combat non-Hodgkin lymphoma. BER suffers from low oral bioavailability due to p-glycoprotein efflux and first-pass metabolism. Lymphatic drug targeting recently gained a profound attention due to circumventing hepatic first-pass metabolism and targeting lymph diseases. Therefore, novel BER-loaded cremochylomicrons were elaborated to mitigate BER drawbacks and enhance its lymphatic targeting and bioavailability. Optimized cremochylomicron was prepared with 2.5% w/v Cremophor El and 12.5% w/w berberine content. Promising in vitro characteristics (particle size=175.6 nm and entrapment efficiency=95.5%) were obtained. Lyophilized system showed high colloidal stability over 6 months. In addition in vivo pharmacokinetics study demonstrated significant enhancement (>2fold) in the rate and extent of absorption in cremochylomicron over free BER. Moreover, cremochylomicrons demonstrated in significant increase in mean residence time and volume of distribution with decreased intestinal drug clearance as a result of efflux inhibition. In another avenue, a significant reduction in BER absorption (43%) in presence of cycloheximide inhibitor was obtained confirming the lymphatic targeting ability of cremochylomicrons. In conclusion, berberine-loaded cremochylomicron could be considered as a promising nanoplatform for targeting lymphatic system and improving BER oral bioavailability with lower dose and side effects.

AB Curcumin is known to possess a wide range of pharmacological activities for the treatment of chronic or inflammatory diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and various cancers. However, the therapeutic efficacy of curcumin is restricted by its poor bioavailability after oral administration. In this study, the effects of various cyclodextrins on the intestinal absorption of curcumin were evaluated in rat intestine by an in situ closed-loop method. Among the tested cyclodextrins, 50mM alpha-cyclodextrin significantly enhanced the absorption of curcumin without inducing any intestinal toxicity. The analysis of cellular transport across Caco-2 cell monolayers showed that 50mM a-cyclodextrin reduced the transepithelial electrical resistance value of cell monolayers and improved the permeability of 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein, a poorly absorbable drug, which is mainly transported via a paracellular pathway. Furthermore, the western blotting analysis showed that a-cyclodextrin decreased the expression of claudin-4, a tight junction-associated protein, in brush border membrane vesicles. Additionally, alpha-cyclodextrin increased the membrane fluidity of lipid bilayers in brush border membrane vesicles and may also have promoted the permeation of drug molecules via a transcellular pathway. These results suggested that alpha-cyclodextrin might enhance the intestinal absorption of curcumin via both paracellular and transcellular pathways.

AB In the pharmaceutical industry, in vitro dissolution testing of solid oral dosage forms is a very important tool for drug development and quality control. However, ion-pairing interaction between the ionic drugand surfactants in dissolution medium often occurs, resulting in inconsistent and incomplete drug release. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) mediated medium on the dissolution behaviors of a poorly soluble cationic drug (Drug B). The study was carried out by measuring solubility of Drug B substance and dissolution rate of Drug B product in media containing SDS. Desolubilization of Drug B substance was observed at pH 4.5 in the presence of SDS at concentrations below critical micelle concentration (CMC) which is attributed to the formation of an insoluble di-dodecyl sulfate salt between SDS and Drug B. This ion-pairing effect is less significant with increasing medium pH where Drug B is less ionized and CMC of SDS is lower. In medium at pH 4.5, dissolution of Drug B product was found incomplete with SDS concentration below CMC due to the desolubilization of Drug B substance. In media with SDS level above CMC, the dissolution rate is rather slower with higher inter-vessel variations compared to that obtained in pH 4.5 medium without SDS. The dissolution results demonstrate that the presence of SDS in medium generates unexpected irregular dissolution profiles for Drug B which are attributed to incompatible dissolution medium for this particular drug. Therefore, non-ionic surfactant was selected for Drug B product dissolution method and ion-pairing effect in SDS mediated medium should be evaluated when developing a dissolution method for any poorly soluble cationic drugs.

AB Parenteral administration of Busulfan (BU) conquers the bioavailability and biovariability related issues of oral BU by maintaining the plasma drug concentration in therapeutic range with minimal fluctuations thereby significantly reducing the side effects. Busulfex (R) is the only commercially available parenteral formulation of BU composed of organic solvents N, N-dimethylacetamide and polyethylene glycol 400. Since, BU is highly susceptible to hydrolytic degradation; Busulfex (R) has poor physical and chemical stability in IV fluids. It is quintessential to develop organic solvent free formulation of BU using parenterally acceptable excipients to enhance its solubility and stability in IV fluids. The Proliposomal formulation of BU was prepared by adsorption-sonicaton method using egg phosphotidylcholine, cholesterol, tween 80 and mannitol. Vesicle size and entrapment efficiency were optimized using 2(4) full factorial design and characterized by DSC, PXRD and TEM. Optimized formulation spontaneously forms 74.0 +/- 1.7 nm sized nanovesicles with 72.9 +/- 1.5 % entrapment efficiency. DSC and PXRD studies revealed that BU was present in phospholipid bilayer in amorphized form and TEM images confirmed the multi lamellar vesicular structure. Physicochemical stability of BU was significantly enhanced with proliposomal formulation. In-vivo studies in Sprague Dawley rats showed proliposomal formulation has comparable immunosuppression activity and 110.62 % relative bioavailability as compared to marketed Busulfan formulation i.e. Busulfex (R).

AB The main purpose of this study was to develop a semisolid mucoadhesive formulation for the non-invasive vaginal administration of doxepin (DOX) for relief of pain derived from the scarring process after surgery. An orafix (R) platform loading DOX was tested for adequate stability, rheology and vaginal mucoadhesion capacity. The formulation exhibited appropriate pH and was microbiologically stable. The rheological studies confirmed its pseudoplastic and thixotropic nature with prevalence of the elastic behavior component over the viscous one. Appropriate syringeability and spreadability results were also confirmed. Different experiments showed adequate mucoadhesion capacity even in the presence of simulated vaginal fluid. Finally, DOX release, permeation and retention in vaginal mucosa studies were also accomplished with promising results. DOX release kinetics followed the modified Higuchi model and the permeation studies did not render such high values as to suggest potential systemic absorption which could lead to undesirable systemic side effects. Therefore, we can hypostatize that the proposed formulation may assist to fill in the therapeutic gap regarding pure pain relief at local level in vagina.

AB Exfoliated nanocomposites of chitosan-magnesium aluminum silicate (CS-MAS) particles are characterized by good compressibility but poor flowability. Thus, the aims of this study were to investigate agglomerates of CS-MAS nanocomposites prepared using the agglomerating agents water, ethanol, or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) for flowability enhancement and to evaluate the agglomerates obtained as direct compression fillers for tablets. The results showed that the addition of agglomerating agents did not affect crystallinity, but slightly influenced thermal behavior of the CS-MAS nanocomposites. The agglomerates prepared using water were larger than those prepared using 95% ethanol because high swelling of the layer of chitosonium acetate occurred, allowing formation of solid bridges and capillary force between particles, leading to higher flowability and particle strength. Incorporation of PVP resulted in larger agglomerates with good flowability and high strength due to the binder hardening mechanism. The tablets prepared from agglomerates using water showed lower hardness, shorter disintegration times and faster drug release than those using 95% ethanol. In contrast, greater hardness and more prolonged drug release were obtained from the tablets prepared from agglomerates using PVP. Additionally, the agglomerates of CS-MAS nanocomposites showed good carrying capacity and provided desirable characteristics of direct compression tablets.

AB Medical device-associated infections present a leading global healthcare challenge, and effective strategies to prevent infections are urgently required. Herein, we present an innovative anti-adherent hydrogel copolymer as a candidate catheter coating with complementary hydrophobic drug-carrying and eluting capacities. The amphiphilic block copolymer, Poloxamer 188, was chemically-derivatized with methacryloyl moieties and copolymerized with the hydrogel monomer, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate. Performance of the synthesized copolymers was evaluated in terms of equilibrium swelling, surface water wettability, mechanical integrity, resistance to encrustation and bacterial adherence, and ability to control release of the loaded fluoroquinolone antibiotic, ofloxacin. The developed matrices were able to provide significant protection from fouling, with observed reductions of over 90% in both adherence of the common urinary pathogen Escherichia coli and encrusting crystalline deposits of calcium and magnesium salts relative to the commonly employed hydrogel, poly (hydroxyethyl methacrylate). Additionally, the release kinetics of a loaded hydrophobic drug could be readily tuned through facile manipulation of polymer composition. This combinatorial approach shows significant promise in the development of suitable systems for prevention of catheter-associated infections.

AB Here, we aimed to develop protein loaded microspheres (MSs) using penta-block PLGA-based copolymers to obtain sustained and complete protein release. We varied MS morphology and studied the control of protein release. Lysozyme was used as a model protein and MSs were prepared using the solid-in-oil-in-water emulsion solvent extraction method. We synthesized and studied various penta-block PLGA-based copolymers. Copolymer characteristics (LA/GA ratio and molecular weight of PLGA blocks) influenced MS morphology. MS porosity was influenced by process parameters (such as solvent type, polymer concentration, emulsifying speed), whereas the aqueous volume for extraction and stabilizer did not have a significant effect. MSs of the same size, but different morphologies, exhibited different protein release behavior, with porous structures being essential for the continuous and complete release of encapsulated protein. These findings suggest strategies to engineer the morphology of MSs produced from PLGA-based multi-block copolymers to achieve appropriate release rates for a protein delivery system.

AB Chitosan as a polycationic non-viral vector for gene delivery has the advantage of being a biocompatible and biodegradable polymer. However, without laborious chemical modifications to its structure, it is of limited use as a gene delivery vehicle due to its low ability to efficiently transfect under physiological conditions. To address this problem, we developed novel liposome encapsulated chitosan nanoparticles; lipochitoplexes (LCPs). Chitosan nanoparticles (CsNPs) were obtained using the ionic gelation technique. For this purpose, an ultrapure low molecular weight chitosan with a high degree of deacetylation was cross-linked using polyanionic tripolyphosphate resulting in efficient entrapment of plasmid DNA (pDNA) inside the nanoparticles. LCPs were prepared by incubating chitosan nanoparticles together with anionic liposomes (DPPC/Cholesterol). The LCPs offered better pDNA protection, reduced cytotoxicity and at least twofold increase in the transfection efficiency under physiological conditions. The efficiency of our delivery vehicle was also proved in vivo in the chorioallantoic membrane model (CAM). LCPs were able to transfect the CAM without traumatising the surrounding blood vessels. This new biocompatible composite system devoid of chemical modifications, organic solvents and harsh production conditions makes it an optimal gene delivery vehicle for in vivo applications offering new insights into the field of non-viral gene therapy.

AB It is found that the content of SiO2 inclusions in the As2S3 volume is increased during chalcogenide glass melting in silica glassware with subsequent cooling to solid sample and separation from the container walls. The experiment consisted in repetition of cycles of "chalcogenide ingot melting and heating to 450-600 degrees C - cooling the melt to a glass transition temperature - separation of the sample from the silica-glass container walls - cooling to room temperature". Content and size of the inclusions in the initial glass and the samples after the "melting-solidification" cycles was controlled by means of laser ultramicroscopy and optical microscopy. The concentration of micrometer-sized particles was found to increase with cycles of melting and solidification.
   The increase of particles concentration is explained by the combined effect of a number of factors such as high adhesion of glassy arsenic sulfide to silica glass and strong radial and longitudinal shrinkage of the chalcogenide ingot during cooling compared with silica-glass container due to significant differences in their linear coefficients of thermal expansion. It leads to destruction of the adhesion contact along the boundary of solid phases and the surface layers of glasses with separation of microprotrusions and fragments of silica glass surface and their fixation in the surface layers of As2S3 glass.
   The excess optical losses in glassy arsenic sulfide, caused by this type of contaminating action of apparatus, have been estimated.

AB The results of investigation of the impurity and phase inclusions as sources of non-selective losses in high-purity chalcogenide and tellurite glasses are reported. Extinction on the SiO2 inclusions is shown to be responsible for non-selective losses in the chalcogenide glasses obtained by direct synthesis from elements in quartz equipment. Optimization of the temperature/duration conditions of the synthesis makes it possible to decrease these losses. The problem of achieving the theoretical minimum of optical loss in the glasses prone to crystallization is considered. The minimal scattering loss in such glasses can be limited not only by "freezing" fluctuations but also by the phase inhomogeneity of the glasses. A substantial contribution of the phase inclusions to optical losses is demonstrated on the example of high-purity tellurite glasses. The scattering in highly homogeneous samples of these glasses appears to be two orders of magnitude higher than the known theoretical value for scattering on "freezing" fluctuations.

Two fiber coupler geometries with angles alpha(1) = 70 degrees and alpha(2) = 40 degrees between the fibers were investigated and nature of excess loss has been studied. Excess loss and coupling ratios on time for both geometries were determined. Excess losses were measured to be 7 dB and 5 dB for alpha(1) and alpha(2) geometries respectively. For alpha(1) geometry 70:30 and for alpha(2) geometry 55:45 coupling ratios were achieved. For alpha(2) geometry coupling ratio at wavelength 2.64 mu m was 63:37.

AB The Te20As30Se50 (TAS) glass has been studied under the extreme conditions of high energy milling. Starting from the raw materials, an amorphization process occurs progressively reaching an unstable intermediate state and the final stable state then. Despite its high resistance against crystallization when made using silica tubes, an intermediate state is reached when mechanically alloyed into powder. The evolution of the glass structure has been investigated using Raman spectroscopy and MAS NMR of Se-77 according to the milling time. Optimized parameters and conditions to compact milled powders by Spark Plasma Sintering show the possibility to design infrared windows transparent from 2 to 20 mu m. A correlation to the thermo-mechanical properties of densified powder using hot pressing has been made.

AB It is demonstrated that inductively coupled atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) can be successfully used for determination of matrix elements of As-S glasses with the expanded uncertainty within 0.05-0.1 mol%. The main advantage of ICP-AES method as compared with X-ray methods is the use of calibration (standard) samples in the form of solutions. The minimum mass of the glass sample, sufficient for analysis, is similar to 30 mg, which makes it possible to analyze expensive materials as well as some types of optical fibers. The results of analysis of real bulk samples by the methods of ICP-AES and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XFS) are compared. With respect to determination of macro-components of glasses the ICP-AES method is highly competitive with the abilities of X-ray method.

AB Transmission electron microscopy results are presented for as-deposited amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5 thin films after theirs isothermal annealing and CW laser illumination. Obtained microphotographs suggested that the crystallization process was driven solely by heterogeneous nucleation on the film boundary. The simplified model of steady-state crystallization process was developed for the case of heterogeneous nucleation mechanism. The values of nucleation rate and growth rate for isothermal and CW laser crystallization are calculated. The calculated values are in reasonable agreement with both our experimental data and with results previously published by the other authors.

AB The luminescence and optical absorption of Eu2+-doped fluorohafnate glasses in the HfR4-BaF2-LaF3-AlF3-NaF (HBLAN) system have been reported. It is shown that divalent europium does not luminesce in the fluorohafnate glass due to ionization of excited Eu2+. The Eu2+ luminescence appears after heat treatment of the HBLAN glass containing BaCl2. At X-ray excitation of the HBLAN glass the luminescence spectrum has a wide intrinsic band in the region of 250-450 nm. The substitution of fluorine with chlorine results as a shift both of the intrinsic luminescence band and of the UV absorption edge to the region of the longer wavelengths.

AB Fluorozirconate-phosphate glasses of the composition ZrF4-BaF2-NaPO3 doped with EuF3 have been investigated by the methods of differential thermal (DTA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance (F-19 NMR, F-19 and P-31 MAS NMR), luminescence spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The thermal behavior of the fabricated glasses is similar to that of fluorozirconate glasses - NaPO3 dopants decrease the glass transition temperature (Tg) from 300 down to 250 degrees C and increase the glass stability to crystallization (Delta T). Resonance lines in F-19 NMR spectra correspond to the glass fluorozirconate network, whereas the F-19 and P-31 MAS NMR data indicate to the presence of bridge and end fluorine atoms in the structure and to low degree of depolymerization of phosphate chains. Thermal treatment in the temperature range T-g-T-x1 induces crystallization of nanosized particles, whose composition corresponds to beta-BaZrF6, The SEM data indicate to the globular structure of glasses and synthesized glass ceramics, while the particle sizes are within the range 20-160 nm. The intensity of luminescence of glasses doped with europium(III) increases upon doping with 2.5-10 mol% of NaPO3 and decreases in glass ceramics. In glass and glass ceramics, europium ions are predominantly present in the fluorozirconate matrix.

AB The binary MoO3 - TeO2 glasses doped with 0-0.5 mol% of Ni2+ ions were prepared by the melt-quenching technique using inorganic salts and acids as starting materials. The optical transmission spectra of all prepared glasses were studied in the wavelength range 0.5-6 mu m. Two broad bands with maxima at 744 and 1318 nm are produced by octahedrally coordination nickel ions. The crystal field splitting energy and Racah parameters of Ni2+ ions were calculated by using the Tanabe-Sugano diagrams. The spectral dependence of the specific absorption coefficient of nickel was established and the value of the integral absorption coefficient in the wavelength range 0.6-2.8 mu m was found as (14.5 +/- 0.3) cm(-2)/(ppmwt). The value of the optical band gap is observed to decrease while the refractive index and Urbach's energy increase with increase in the concentration of Ni2+ in the glasses.

AB Copper-containing ZnO-TeO2 glasses were synthesized using orthotelluric acid, zinc nitrate and the formed batch was doped with copper nitrate. EPR and optical spectra in a wide transparency range from were measured for all glass samples. The values of the spin-Hamiltonian parameters indicate that the Cu2+ ions in the glasses are present in octahedral coordination with some trigonal distortion. The molecular orbital bonding parameters have been calculated and were found to be independent of Cu2+ concentration in glasses. The optical transmittance spectra of doped glasses show a single broad band at 820 inn, which was assigned to the overlapping B-2(1g) -> B-2(2g), B-2(1g) -> E-2(g) and B-2(1g)-> (2)A(1g) electronic transitions. The spectral dependence of the specific absorption coefficient of Cu2+ ions was calculated for glass samples in the range of 310-2800 nm and was found that the specific absorption coefficient at 820 nm is (103 +/- 1) cm(-1)/(wt%) and the integral absorption coefficient in the range 0.5-2.8 mu m is (63 +/- 2) cm(-2)/(ppm wt). From the optical data some optical parameters such as the optical energy gap, Urbach energy, metallization criterion and the cut-off wavelength were calculated. It is observed that the optical band gap decreases with an increase in concentration of copper content.

AB A series of samples of high-purity glasses TeO2-WO3-La2O3-Er2O3-Bi2O3 with different mole content of Er2O3 was synthesized. The total content of the 3d-transition metals impurities did not exceed 0.1-2 ppm wt., the hydroxyl groups absorption near similar to 3 mu m was as low as 0.001-0.01 cm(-1). The glasses have been studied by differential scanning calorimetry. Glass transition temperatures were determined; for the highest Er2O3 concentrations the thermal effects of crystallization were observed at the heating rate of 5 K/min. The temperature dependences of heat capacity C-p degrees= f(T) in the range of 320-1050 K were found. Using the experimental data the standard thermodynamic functions were calculated: enthalpy H degrees(T) - H degrees(0), entropy S degrees(T) - S degrees(0) and Gibbs energy G degrees(T) - G degrees(0) in vitreous and "supercooled liquid" states. Model and parametric similarity of properties within the framework of statistical approach with determined correlation dependencies of parameters on composition makes it possible to predict the thermodynamic functions for other compositions of glasses within the system.

AB High-purity tungstate-tellurite glasses doped with molybdenum, lanthanum or bismuth oxides were investigated from a point of view promising medium for nonlinear optical devices fabrication. A tubular-like architecture was employed for fabrication of waveguides in the of tellurite glasses, in which refractive index change is negative under femtosecond laser writing at 1028 nm. Thermal, nonlinear optical properties and optimal laser writing conditions were determined. The glasses revealed a very high stability against crystallization, high transparency in the visible, near- and mid-IR regions, large values of Kerr nonlinear coefficient that are within the range of (4.3 divided by 5.4).10(-6) cm(2)/GW. The highest values of the nonlinear coefficient were found. for bismuth containing glasses. The single mode waveguide with propagation loss of 0.15 dB/cm at 1064 nm was inscribed in tungstate-tellurite glass.

AB PbSe quantum dots (QDs) were precipitated in borosilicate glasses, and effects of B2O3 content on the optical properties of glasses were investigated. The diameters of the PbSe QDs in glasses increased from 3.70 nm to 7.32 nm as [B2O3] increased from 10 mol% to 20 mol% even when all glasses were heat-treated at 460 degrees C for 10 h. Photoluminescence (PL) peaks extended to wavelengths of 2154 nm when B2O3 content increased to 20 mol%. The viscosities eta of glasses at 460 degrees C decreased significantly with the addition of B2O3 i.e., 2.86 x 10(13) Pa.s at [B2O3] = 0.0% to 1.94 x 1011 Pas at [B2O3] = 20%. These decreases in eta led to a large increase in the diffusion of ions in glass matrix including Pb2+ and Se2- that facilitated the precipitation and growth of PbSe QDs in glasses. These results demonstrate that the wavelength of PL emissions by QDs can be controlled by manipulating the composition of the host glass.

AB In this paper we deal with the extension of the Fast Kinetic Scheme (FKS) (Dimarco and Loubere, 2013 [26]) originally constructed for solving the BGK equation, to the more challenging case of the Boltzmann equation. The scheme combines a robust and fast method for treating the transport part based on an innovative Lagrangian technique supplemented with conservative fast spectral schemes to treat the collisional operator by means of an operator splitting approach. This approach along with several implementation features related to the parallelization of the algorithm permits to construct an efficient simulation tool which is numerically tested against exact and reference solutions on classical problems arising in rarefied gas dynamic. We present results up to the 3D x 3D case for unsteady flows for the Variable Hard Sphere model which may serve as benchmark for future comparisons between different numerical methods for solving the multidimensional Boltzmann equation. For this reason, we also provide for each problem studied details on the computational cost and memory consumption as well as comparisons with the BGK model or the limit model of compressible Euler equations.

AB We present a new algorithm for the discretization of the non-relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations for the study of plasmas in the kinetic regime. Using the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for the spatial discretization, we obtain a high order accurate solution for the plasma's distribution function. Time stepping for the distribution function is done explicitly with a third order strong-stability preserving Runge-Kutta method. Since the Vlasov equation in the Vlasov-Maxwell system is a high dimensional transport equation, up to six dimensions plus time, we take special care to note various features we have implemented to reduce the cost while maintaining the integrity of the solution, including the use of a reduced high-order basis set. A series of benchmarks, from simple wave and shock calculations, to a five dimensional turbulence simulation, are presented to verify the efficacy of our set of numerical methods, as well as demonstrate the power of the implemented features.

AB The interaction between fluid flow and a deformable porous medium is a complicated multi-physics problem, which can be described by a coupled model based on the Stokes and poroelastic equations. Amonolithic multigrid method together with either a coupled Vanka smoother or a decoupled Uzawa smoother is employed as an efficient numerical technique for the linear discrete system obtained by finite volumes on staggered grids. Aspecialty in our modeling approach is that at the interface of the fluid and poroelastic medium, two unknowns from the different subsystems are defined at the same grid point. We propose a special discretization at and near the points on the interface, which combines the approximation of the governing equations and the considered interface conditions. In the decoupled Uzawa smoother, Local Fourier Analysis (LFA) helps us to select optimal values of the relaxation parameter appearing. To implement the monolithic multigrid method, grid partitioning is used to deal with the interface updates when communication is required between two subdomains. Numerical experiments show that the proposed numerical method has an excellent convergence rate. The efficiency and robustness of the method are confirmed in numerical experiments with typically small realistic values of the physical coefficients. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper the projection hybrid FV/FE method presented in [1] is extended to account for species transport equations. Furthermore, turbulent regimes are also considered thanks to the k-emodel. Regarding the transport diffusion stage new schemes of high order of accuracy are developed. The CVC Kolgan-type scheme and ADER methodology are extended to 3D. The latter is modified in order to profit from the dual mesh employed by the projection algorithm and the derivatives involved in the diffusion term are discretized using a Galerkin approach. The accuracy and stability analysis of the new method are carried out for the advection-diffusion-reaction equation. Within the projection stage the pressure correction is computed by a piecewise linear finite element method. Numerical results are presented, aimed at verifying the formal order of accuracy of the scheme and to assess the performance of the method on several realistic test problems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB A stable, non-dissipative, and conservative flux-reconstruction (FR) scheme is constructed and demonstrated for the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. Aproposed FR framework adopts a split form(also known as the skew-symmetric form) for convective terms. Sufficient conditions to satisfy both the primary conservation (PC) and kinetic energy preservation (KEP) properties are rigorously derived by polynomial-based analysis for a general FR framework. It is found that the split form needs to be expressed in the PC split form or KEP split form to satisfy each property in discrete sense. The PC split form is retrieved from existing general forms (Kennedy and Gruber [33]); in contrast, we have newly introduced the KEP split form as a comprehensive form constituting a KEP scheme in the FR framework. Furthermore, Gauss-Lobatto (GL) solution points and g(2) correction function are required to satisfy the KEP property while any correction functions are available for the PC property. The split-form FR framework to satisfy the KEP property, eventually, is similar to the split-form DGSEM-GL method proposed by Gassner [23], but which, in this study, is derived solely by polynomial-based analysis without explicitly using the diagonal-norm SBP property. Based on a series of numerical tests (e.g., Sod shock tube), both the PC and KEP properties have been verified. We have also demonstrated that using a non-dissipative KEP flux, a sixteenth-order (p15) simulation of the viscous Taylor-Green vortex (Re = 1,600) is stable and its results are free of unphysical oscillations on relatively coarse mesh (total number of degrees of freedom (DoFs) is 128(3)).

AB We propose a new high-order accurate numerical boundary treatment for solving hyperbolic systems of conservation laws and Euler equations using a Lagrange-remap approach on Cartesian grids in cases of physical boundaries not aligned with the mesh. The method is an adaptation of the Inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure [34-38] to the Lagrange-remap approach, which considerably alleviates the algebra. High-order accurate ghost values of conservative variables are imposed using Taylor expansions whose coefficients are found by inverting a (linear or non-linear) system which is well posed in all our examples. For 2D problems, a least-square procedure is added to prevent extrapolation instabilities. The Lagrange-remap formalism also provides a simpler fluid-structure coupling which is also described. Numerical examples are given for the linear case and Euler equations in 1D and 2D. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper a novel method to solve the constant coefficient wave equation, subject to interface jump conditions, is presented. In general, such problems pose issues for standard finite difference solvers, as the inherent discontinuity in the solution results in erroneous derivative information wherever the stencils straddle the given interface. Here, however, the recently proposed Correction Function Method (CFM) is used, in which correction terms are computed from the interface conditions, and added to affected nodes to compensate for the discontinuity. In contrast to existing methods, these corrections are not simply defined at affected nodes, but rather generalized to a continuous function within a small region surrounding the interface. As a result, the correction function may be defined in terms of its own governing partial differential equation (PDE) which may be solved, in principle, to arbitrary order of accuracy. The resulting scheme is not only arbitrarily high order, but also robust, having already seen application to Poisson problems and the heat equation. By extending the CFM to this new class of PDEs, the treatment of wave interface discontinuities in homogeneous media becomes possible. This allows, for example, for the straightforward treatment of infinitesimal source terms and sharp boundaries, free of staircasing errors. Additionally, new modifications to the CFM are derived, allowing compatibility with explicit multi-step methods, such as Runge-Kutta (RK4), without a reduction in accuracy. These results are then verified through numerous numerical experiments in one and two spatial dimensions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Voronoi grids have been successfully used to represent density structures of gas in astronomical hydrodynamics simulations. While some codes are explicitly built around using a Voronoi grid, others, such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), use particle-based representations and can benefit from constructing a Voronoi grid for post-processing their output. So far, calculating the density of each Voronoi cell from SPH data has been done numerically, which is both slow and potentially inaccurate. This paper proposes an alternative analytic method, which is fast and accurate. We derive an expression for the integral of a cubic spline kernel over the volume of a Voronoi cell and link it to the density of the cell. Mass conservation is ensured rigorously by the procedure. The method can be applied more broadly to integrate a spherically symmetric polynomial function over the volume of a random polyhedron. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents an automatic mesh generation algorithm for body-fitted structured meshes in Computational Fluids Dynamics (CFD) analysis using the Advancing Extraction Method (AEM). The method is applicable to two-dimensional domains with complex geometries, which have the hierarchical tree-like topography with extrusion-like structures (i.e., branches or tributaries) and intrusion-like structures (i.e., peninsula or dikes). With the AEM, the hierarchical levels of sub-domains can be identified, and the block boundary of each sub-domain in convex polygon shape in each level can be extracted in an advancing scheme. In this paper, several examples were used to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm for automatic structured mesh generation, and the implementation of the method.

AB A level-set method is presented for solving two-phase flows with soluble surfactant. The Navier-Stokes equations are solved along with the bulk surfactant and the interfacial surfactant equations. In particular, the convection-diffusion equation for the bulk surfactant on the irregular moving domain is solved by using a level-set based diffusive-domain method. A conservation law for the total surfactant mass is derived, and a re-scaling procedure for the surfactant concentrations is proposed to compensate for the surfactant mass loss due to numerical diffusion. The whole numerical algorithm is easy for implementation. Several numerical simulations in 2D and 3D show the effects of surfactant solubility on drop dynamics under shear flow.

AB Inherently coupled flow and geomechanics processes in fractured shale media have implications for shale gas production. The system involves highly complex geo-textures comprised of a heterogeneous anisotropic fracture network spatially embedded in an ultratight matrix. In addition, nonlinearities due to viscous flow, diffusion, and desorption in the matrix and high velocity gas flow in the fractures complicates the transport. In this paper, we develop a multiscale model reduction approach to couple gas flow and geomechanics in fractured shale media. A Discrete Fracture Model (DFM) is used to treat the complex network of fractures on a fine grid. The coupled flow and geomechanics equations are solved using a fixed stress-splitting scheme by solving the pressure equation using a continuous Galerkin method and the displacement equation using an interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin method. We develop a coarse grid approximation and coupling using the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM). GMsFEM constructs the multiscale basis functions in a systematic way to capture the fracture networks and their interactions with the shale matrix. Numerical results and an error analysis is provided showing that the proposed approach accurately captures the coupled process using a few multiscale basis functions, i.e. a small fraction of the degrees of freedom of the fine-scale problem.

AB A numerical method for the simulation of two-phase flow with phase change based on the Gradient-Augmented-Level-set (GALS) strategy is presented. Sharp capturing of the vaporization process is enabled by: i) identification of the vapor-liquid interface, Gamma(t), at the subgrid level, ii) discontinuous treatment of thermal physical properties (except for mu), and iii) enforcement of mass, momentum, and energy jump conditions, where the gradients of the dependent variables are obtained at Gamma(t) and are consistent with their analytical expression, i.e. no local averaging is applied. Treatment of the jump in velocity and pressure at Gamma(t) is achieved using the Ghost Fluid Method. The solution of the energy equation employs the sub-grid knowledge of Gamma(t) to discretize the temperature Laplacian using second-order one-sided differences, i.e. the numerical stencil completely resides within each respective phase. To carefully evaluate the benefits or disadvantages of the GALS approach, the standard level set method is implemented and compared against the GALS predictions. The results show the expected trend that interface identification and transport are predicted noticeably better with GALS over the standard level set. This benefit carries over to the prediction of the Laplacian and temperature gradients in the neighborhood of the interface, which are directly linked to the calculation of the vaporization rate. However, when combining the calculation of interface transport and reinitialization with two-phase momentum and energy, the benefits of GALS are to some extent neutralized, and the causes for this behavior are identified and analyzed. Overall the additional computational costs associated with GALS are almost the same as those using the standard level set technique. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Among numerical methods for partial differential equations arising from steepest descent dynamics of energy functionals (e.g., Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard equations), the convex splitting method is well-known to maintain unconditional energy stability for a large time step size. In this work, we show how to use the convex splitting idea to find transition states, i.e., index-1 saddle points of the same energy functionals. Based on the iterative minimization formulation (IMF) for saddle points [14], we introduce the convex splitting method to minimize the auxiliary functional at each cycle of the IMF. We present a general principle of constructing convex splitting forms for these auxiliary functionals and show how to avoid solving nonlinear equations. The new numerical scheme based on the convex splitting method allows for large time step sizes. The new methods are tested for the one dimensional Ginzburg-Landau energy functional in the search of the Allen-Cahn or Cahn-Hilliard types of transition states. We provide the numerical results of transition states for the two dimensional Landau-Brazovskii energy functional for diblock copolymers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Aiming for the simulation of colloidal droplets in microfluidic devices, we present here a numerical method for two-fluid systems subject to surface tension and depletion forces among the suspended droplets. The algorithm is based on an efficient solver for the incompressible two-phase Navier-Stokes equations, and uses a mass-conserving level set method to capture the fluid interface. The four novel ingredients proposed here are, firstly, an interface-correction level set (ICLS) method; global mass conservation is achieved by performing an additional advection near the interface, with a correction velocity obtained by locally solving an algebraic equation, which is easy to implement in both 2D and 3D. Secondly, we report a second-order accurate geometric estimation of the curvature at the interface and, thirdly, the combination of the ghost fluid method with the fast pressure-correction approach enabling an accurate and fast computation even for large density contrasts. Finally, we derive a hydrodynamic model for the interaction forces induced by depletion of surfactant micelles and combine it with a multiple level set approach to study short-range interactions among droplets in the presence of attracting forces.

AB This paper deals with the numerical resolution of a shallow water viscoplastic flow model. Viscoplastic materials are characterized by the existence of a yield stress: below a certain critical threshold in the imposed stress, there is no deformation and the material behaves like a rigid solid, but when that yield value is exceeded, the material flows like a fluid. In the context of avalanches, it means that after going down a slope, the material can stop and its free surface has a non-trivial shape, as opposed to the case of water (Newtonian fluid). The model involves variational inequalities associated with the yield threshold: finite volume schemes are used together with duality methods (namely Augmented Lagrangian and Bermudez-Moreno) to discretize the problem. To be able to accurately simulate the stopping behavior of the avalanche, new schemes need to be designed, involving the classical notion of well-balancing. In the present context, it needs to be extended to take into account the viscoplastic nature of the material as well as general bottoms with wet/dry fronts which are encountered in geophysical geometries. Here we derive such schemes in 2D as the follow up of the companion paper treating the 1D case. Numerical tests include in particular a generalized 2D benchmark for Bingham codes (the Bingham-Couette flow with twonon-zero boundary conditions on the velocity) and a simulation of the avalanche path of Taconnaz in Chamonix-Mont-Blanc to show the usability of these schemes on real topographies from digital elevation models (DEM).

AB The sequence information of the genomic form of the human ABO blood group orthologous gene (erythrocyte antigen A, EAA) is not complete in pigs. Therefore, we cloned and characterized the nucleotide sequence of EAA intron 7, which is critical to understand genetic difference between A and 0 blood groups in pigs, covering complete genomic sequence information of EAA excluding a similar to 560 bp unsequencible gap. We also analyzed genetic polymorphisms within EAA intron 7 and exon 8. We found difference in A0 blood group frequencies among pig breeds. In addition, we designed a new genomic DNA-based A0 blood group typing method and improved the accuracy and simplicity of the typing.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous non-coding small RNA, known as key post-transcriptional regulators for development and function of reproductive organ in animals. However, limited information is currently available on the regulatory roles of miRNAs in crustacean reproduction. In the present study, we performed small RNA deep sequencing in ovary and testis tissues of the swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus, which is a commercially important species in East Asian countries, to identify and characterize the miRNAs in gonads. We obtained 187 and 225 miRNAs from ovary and testis, respectively, including 188 known and 65 novel miRNAs. Expression profiling of the identified miRNAs indicated that ovary and testis shared the same six most abundant miRNAs (let-7, let-7c, let-7f, mir-2, mir-184 and mir-276), which accounted for a large proportion of total reads in gonads (35.78% for ovary and 37.01% for testis) and indicated that they may play essential roles in gonadal development and function. Statistically, 75 miRNAs showed differential expression level between ovary and testis tissues, and the putative target genes of these miRNAs were significantly enriched in 14 KEGG pathways, including several pathways important in reproduction, such as GnRH signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, ovarian steroidogenesis and TGF-beta signaling pathway. Further analysis found that the differentially expressed miRNAs exhibited stage-specific expression during ovarian and testicular development, suggesting their potential roles in reproductive development. Our study provided the first insight into regulatory roles of gonadal miRNAs and would serve as a valuable resource for investigating miRNA-mediated mechanisms of reproduction regulation in P. trituberculatus and other crustaceans.

AB The genetic basis of stress resistance in extremophilic microalgae is not well studied. In this study, a gene of unknown function, the cluster58 or CL58 gene, was identified from the halotolerant green alga Chlamydomonas W80 and characterized. The CL58 gene encodes a protein containing a domain of unknown function, the CHRD domain, and a putative secretory signaling sequence at its N-terminus. The levels of CL58 mRNA increased in response to high copper levels and low temperatures. When the CL58 gene was heterologously expressed as a fusion gene with the NanoLuc luciferase gene in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a majority of the NanoLuc activity was detected in the culture medium compared with that in the intracellular fraction. A mutagenic analysis revealed that the putative secretory signaling sequence was sufficient for the secretion of the CL58-NanoLuc fusion protein. In addition, we expressed the protein encoded by the CL58 gene in Escherichia coli; the recombinant, soluble protein was then purified. In summary, we identified a novel gene from C. W80 that appears to encode a stress-responsive, CHRD domain-containing secreted protein.

AB Brain metastatic triple negative breast cancer (BM-TNBC) is afflicted with unfavorable prognosis. However, the molecular events underlying BM-TNBC remain largely unknown. In the present study, we conducted gene expression microarray analysis using the triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and its brain metastatic derivative (MDA-MB-231Brm). Results of microarray analysis showed that a total of 4296 genes were differentially expressed, of which 2433 genes were up-regulated and 1863 genes were down-regulated. Gene Ontology (GO), KEGG pathway and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses indicated differentially expressed genes functionally categorized as genes of signal transduction, multicellular organismal development, ion transport, nervous system development, plasma membrane, extracellular region, calcium ion binding, GTP binding neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. The validity of the microarray results was verified by quantitative real-time PCR analysis of twelve representative genes. The present findings revealed molecular basis and events associated with brain metastasis in TNBC, which will potentially contribute to the understanding of underlying mechanism and develop therapeutic targets.

AB Germline mutations in the novel tumor suppressor gene FLCN are responsible for the autosomal dominant inherited disorder Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome that predisposes to fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts and spontaneous pneumothorax, and an increased risk for developing kidney tumors. Although the encoded protein, folliculin (FLCN), has no sequence homology to known functional domains, x-ray crystallographic studies have shown that the C-terminus of FLCN has structural similarity to DENN (differentially expressed in normal cells and neoplasia) domain proteins that act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for small Rab GTPases. FLCN forms a complex with folliculin interacting proteins 1 and 2 (FNIP1, FNIP2) and with 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This review summarizes FLCN functional studies which support a role for FLCN in diverse metabolic pathways and cellular processes that include modulation of the mTOR pathway, regulation of PGC1 alpha a and mitochondrial biogenesis, cell-cell adhesion and RhoA signaling, control of TFE3/TFEB transcriptional activity, amino acid-dependent activation of mTORC1 on lysosomes through Rag GTPases, and regulation of autophagy. Ongoing research efforts are focused on clarifying the primary FLCN-associated pathway(s) that drives the development of fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts and kidney tumors in BHD patients carrying germline FLCN mutations.

AB The matricellular glycoprotein products of the SPP1 and SPARC genes play critical roles in many aggressive tumor phenotypes including gastric cancer. We sought to test whether the polymorphisms of these two genes, individually or jointly, influence gastric cancer susceptibility. Nine potentially functional, tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) of SPP1 and SPARC were selected and detected using the Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR method in 301 gastric cancer cases and 1441 healthy control subjects. We found that the genotype frequencies of SPP1 rs4754 in gastric cancer were significantly different from those in controls. The rs4754 TT genotype conferred an increased risk of gastric cancer, with unadjusted and adjusted ORs ranging from 1.75 to 1.95 (all P < 0.05). The assessment of the effect modifications of sex and age on the genetic effects also confirmed the statistically significant association of the rs4754 TT genotype with increased gastric cancer risk. Epistatic interactions were found between SPP1 rs4754 and SPARC rs1054204, rs3210714 and rs3549 (all P values for interaction < 0.05). During the assessment of the epistatic effects between pairs of interacting factors, increased gastric cancer risk was observed in the combined presence of the SPP1 rs4754 TT genotype and the common genotypes of interacting SPARC SNPs, with ORs ranging from 3.94 to 4.41. When the genetic influence of SPP1 rs4754 TT was excluded, the genetic effects of the SPARC rs1054204, rs3210714 and rs3549 common genotypes on gastric cancer susceptibility switched from being risky to beneficial. These data reveal an association between the SPP1 rs4754 polymorphism and altered risk of gastric cancer and highlight an important role of the epistatic effects of SPP rs4754 with SPARC polymorphisms in gastric carcinogenesis. Additional functional experiments and independent large-scale studies, especially in other ethnic populations, are needed to confirm our results.

ID GENE; DIAGNOSIS; SPECTRUM
AB Congenital dyserythropoietic anaemias (CDAs) are a group of rare haematological disorders characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and dyserythropoiesis and reduced numbers of red cells, often with an abnormal morphology. Pathogenic defects in CDAN1, C15ORF41, SEC23B, KIF23, KLF1 and GATA1 genes have been identified in CDAs patients. In this study, we described 13 unrelated Chinese CDAs patients and identified 21 mutations, including 5 novel mutations in CDANI gene, and 5 novel mutations in SEC23B gene. Additionally, we predicted the molecular consequence of these missense mutations with Polymorphism Phenotyping v2 (Polyphen), Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT), MutPred (http://mutpredl.mutdb.org/) and Protein Variation Effect Analyzer (Provean, http://provean.jcvi.org/seq_submit.php) and analyzed the conservation of the mutated amino acid among proteins from several mammalian species.

AB Oncogenic role of miR-19 family has been identified in human cancers especially in lymphoid malignancies. However, to date, little studies investigated the role of miR-19 family in myeloid malignancies. Herein, we examined miR-19a/b expression and explored its clinical significance in de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The detection of miR-19a/b expression was performed by real-time quantitative PCR in bone marrow mononuclear cells of 113 patients and 42 healthy donors. Both miR-19a/b levels were significantly increased in AML patients in contrast to controls. Patients with miR-19a/b overexpression were more frequently occurred in female, and had an older age. Moreover, cases with miR-19a overexpression had a higher frequency of U2AF1, C-KIT and CEBPA mutations, whereas miR-19b overexpressed cases harbored U2AF1 and IDH1/2 mutations. There was no significant association of miR-19a overexpression with complete remission (CR) rate and overall survival (OS) among whole-cohort AML, non-M3 AML, and cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). However, although miR-19b overexpression was not correlated with CR rate, patients with miR-19b overexpression presented significantly shorter OS in whole-cohort AML and a trend in non-M3 AML and CN-AML patients. Importantly, our data also showed that miR-19a/b expression level at CR phase was lower than diagnosis time, and was returned to primary level even higher when at relapse phase. Our findings revealed that miR-19a/b overexpression were frequent events in de novo AML patients. Moreover, up-regulation of miR-19b expression was associated with poor prognosis and disease recurrence in AML.

AB Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertner, a perennial grass in the tribe Triticeae (Poaceae), is a wild relative of cereal crops that is suitable for genetic improvement. In this study, we first sequenced the complete chloroplast (cp) genome of Ag. cristatum using Hiseq4000 PE150. The Ag. cristatum chloroplast genome is 135,554 bp in length, has a typical quadripartite structure and contains 76 protein-coding genes, 29 tRNA genes and four rRNA genes. The cp genome of Ag. cristaturn was used for comparison with other seven Triticeae species. One large variable region (800 bp), which primarily contained the rp123 (non-reciprocally translocated from IRs) and accD genes, was detected between rbcL gene and psaI gene within LSC region. The deletion of the accD and translocated rp123 genes in Ag. cristatum indicated an independent gene-loss events or an additional divergence in Triticeae. Analyses of the dn/ds ratio and K2-P's genetic distance for 76 protein-coding genes showed that genes with evolutionary divergence might suffer from the effect of sequence regional constraints or gene functional constraints in Triticeae species. Our research will generally contribute to the knowledge of plastid genome evolution in Triticeae.

AB Precipitation and growth behavior of mushroom-like Ni3Al phase along the dual phase (gamma + gamma') and eutectic gamma - gamma' area interfaces of as-cast JG4246A Ni3Al-based alloy were investigated by using short time cyclic heat treatment. Results showed that vacancies, small angle grain boundaries and dislocations formed along the dual phase (gamma + gamma') and eutectic gamma - gamma' area interfaces during the cyclic heat treatment, which promoted the precipitation of Ni3Al phase along this location. In addition, concentration gradient of Al elements between the eutectic gamma - gamma' area and dual phase (gamma + gamma') areas and the more rapid pipe diffusion provided by dislocations contributed to growth of directional mushroom-like Ni3Al phase.

AB Fabricating a water harvester that exhibits desirable performance is an essential task to solve the fresh water scarcity issue. In this manuscript, we introduced a bio-inspired concept for a novel bead-on-string nanofiber with hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity simultaneously by electrospinning technique, that can be used as a high-performance water harvester. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and water contact angle measurement showed the bio-inspired structures of novel water harvesters and a custommade setup was used to evaluate its water harvesting ability. The water harvesting efficiency of our membrane was determined to be 744 mg/cm(2)/h, which was 91% higher than the virgin PAN membrane. The durability was also tested and reported.

AB Green, eco-friendly method for synthesis of Au-Ag-In-rGO nanocomposite was developed using leaf extract of Piper pedicellatum C.DC. Its characterization was done by UV-Visible, FT-IR, XRD, XPS, EDX and TEM analysis. The alpha-glucosidase inhibitory assay revealed that the Au-Ag-In-rGO has excellent inhibitory potency compared to GO where Acarbose was used as positive control. The IC50 value was found 0.178 +/- 0.01 and 1.330 +/- 0.28 mu g/ml for Au-Ag-In-rGO and GO respectively. Cytotoxicity assay indicated that Au-Ag-In-rGO is more toxic than GO nanoparticles against PC3 prostate cancer cells compared to non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cells, RWPE-1.

ID ZN-BASED ALLOYS; CORROSION BEHAVIOR; EXTRUSION
AB The plastic deformation of biodegradable zinc alloy with 1 wt% of magnesium by hydrostatic extrusion (HE) was performed. The influence of severe plastic deformation on the microstructure and mechanical properties of ZnMg was investigated. Cumulative extrusion with total true strain epsilon = 3.33 was applied to the homogenised material. Microstructure observations carried out using scanning electron microscope (SEM)/ Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) methods, as well as static tensile tests, revealed outstanding results. After the deformation, grain refinement causing substantial strengthening of the material was observed. An average grain size equal to 700 nm and YS = 316 MPa, UTS = 435 MPa with epsilon(f) = 35% was obtained. These results indicate that the HE method enables the grain refinement level and mechanical properties of ZnMg to be obtained, which would not be possible with conventional methods of plastic deformation. The properties of the Zn alloy after HE satisfy the requirements for bioresorbable stent applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we fabricate the sandwich structure based on WOx film which exhibits remarkable nonlinear electrical characteristics. The WOx film is deposited on FTO substrate by using a simple chemical reduction method. The hydrazine hydrate used as reductant is added into precursor. As a result, the nonlinearity of this single-layer device is greatly improved and is as high as 10(4). The XPS analyses indicate that the nonlinear switching behavior can be attributed to the suboxides in WOx film. This work not only enhances the nonlinear electrical characteristics of metal oxide, but also provides a new way for nonlinear devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In2O3/ZnO composite nanotube arrays were prepared on FTO substrate via a novel immersion-calcination method using ZnO nanorods as self-sacrificing templates. The composition and morphology of the In2O3/ZnO samples could be tuned by changing the immersion time of ZnO nanorod arrays in a 0.50 M In(NO3)(3) solution. The photoelectrochemical activity of the prepared samples was studied and the optimized In2O3/ZnO electrode exhibited the highest anodic photocurrent of 0.36 mA cm(-2), which is 3.5 times of that of pure ZnO electrode under visible light illumination. The improved photoelectrochemical performance is ascribed not only to the synergy effect at the interface of In2O3 and ZnO, but also to the enhanced electron transfer along the one dimensional In2O3/ZnO nanotube arrays.

AB A newly developed dielectric elastomer (DE) bending transducer composed of a functionalized graphene-silicone DE composite sandwiched between two graphene flexible electrode layers had been investigated. This bending transducer displayed high actuation displacement (5.3 mm) under 2500 V direct-current electric field. Compared with pure silicone DE, the silicone DE filled with silane coupling agent functionalized graphene nanofillers showed enhanced dielectric constant, and low loss modulus. The silane coupling agent functionalization method is simple, green, and easy to control, and can be used as a general strategy for improving the dielectric and electric actuated strain of DE.

AB Poor thermal stability of porous Ag-based films is one of annoying issues for practical applications. In this letter, the microstructures and thermal stability of Al-doped porous Ag-based films were investigated. Al-doped porous Ag-based films have similar porous structure and high absorption to undoped one. But the pore dimension decreases with increasing Al concentration. Compared with undoped porous Ag-based films, Al-doped ones have outstandingly-enhanced thermal stability. Even annealed at 300 degrees C in air for 60 min, the porous structure is still maintained. This results in comparative optical and electrical properties of annealed Al-doped porous Ag-based film as the as-prepared one. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The growing concern about antibacterial resistance has made it imperative to engineer effective, strong and economic nanoparticles with strong inhibitory activities. copper-nickel (CuNi) bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) have been synthesized solvothermally. X-ray diffraction analysis exhibits CuNi NPs with face-centered-cubic structure arising from (1 0 0), (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) planes. Porous, flaky NPs with interspersed spherical cuboids were observed through scanning electron microscopy. CuNi showed zones of inhibition of 31 mm and 30 mm against S. aureus and E. coli respectively which was comparable to a 31 mm zone observed for a third generation drug, Cefixime. This strong antibacterial activity is due to the synergistic bactericidal Cu2+ and bacteriostatic Ni2+ ions released from CuNi bimetallic NPs. Additively, reactive oxygen species that can be produced on the NP surface enhance the inhibitory activity of CuNi NPs. The obtained results suggest the possible utilization of CuNi NPs as antibacterial coatings and surfaces. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we report that a silicon hierarchical structure, silicon nanoporous pillar array (Si-NPA), was prepared and its visible photocatalytic properties were studied by selecting methyl orange (MO) as the target substance. It was shown that a broadband visible light absorption beyond 96% was reached and a one-hour degradation of 97.7% was achieved under optimized conditions. The excellent photocatalytic property of Si-NPA was attributed to the enlarged bandgap brought by quantum confinement effect and the unique surface morphology and microstructure of Si-NPA. Our experiments might have put forward a promising route for fabricating Si-based photocatalyst to degrade organic pollutants in water. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this letter, we report a discovery of a new radio-photoluminescence (RPL) material. The RPL appeared in vacuum-sintered non-doped K2CO3 ceramics as an evolution of PL emission band peaking at 440 nm. The RPL signal was confirmed to be sensitive to X-rays and stable at room temperature. The RPL response was observed as low as 1 mGy although the sample was not optimized. We strongly believe that this material should be a promising candidate as RPL dosimeter materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB After a standard heat treatment, the morphological evolution of gamma ' precipitates in the directionally solidified Ni-base superalloy M4706 with time is investigated during thermal exposure at 800 degrees C. In contrast to previous results, it is found that as the average particle size increases from 241 to 368 nm with increasing aging time up to 10,000 h, the shape of gamma ' precipitates gradually changes from cuboidal to sphere-like. X-ray diffraction experiments reveal that the constrained gamma/gamma ' lattice misfits of M4706 fall into the range of -0.226% to -0.223% between 800 and 850 degrees C, whereas the value is -0.529% at 1050 degrees C. Based on the experimental results, the morphological transition of gamma ' precipitates is discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, the recently developed environmentally friendly lead-free ferroelectric Na0.35%Ba99.65%Ti99.65%Nb0.35%O3 (NNBT) was firstly used as filler to synthesize ceramic-polymer composites using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as martix. The composites PVDF-xNNBT with different volume fractions of x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5, were prepared via solution mixing and hot pressing method. Dielectric properties were investigated in the temperature range from room temperature to 250 degrees C and frequency range of 10(2)-10(6) Hz. All the investigated composites show high dielectric constant (>100) and low loss tangent (<5%). The best dielectric properties were found in PVDF-0.5NNBT, which shows weakly frequency and temperature dependent dielectric constant of 220 and low loss tangent of 0.037 at 1 kHz. Interfacial relaxation arising from the ceramic-polymer interfaces was suggested to be the main reason of the superior dielectric properties. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of thermal-mechanical processing (TMP) on the microstructure and anti-corrosion property of twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) steel are investigated. It is found that, the corrosion resistance of TWIP steel has been significantly improved with the corrosion potential increased from -0.92 V to -0.69 V and the corrosion current density reduced from 8.76 x 10(-5) A/cm(2) to 1.92 x 10(-5) A/cm(2). Electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) technique is employed to analyze the grain boundaries distributions of TWIP samples. The results indicate that the interrupted high angle boundaries network is the key to the improvement of the corrosion resistance of TWIP steel while the fraction of low-Sigma coincidence site lattice boundaries is just slightly increased from 81% to 86%.

AB In this research, trivalent lanthanide ions Ln(3+) (Ln = Sc, La, Gd, Y, Lu) were codoped into the CaSi2O2N2:Eu2+ matrix for substituting at the Ca2+ sites to improve the photoluminescence and thermal stability. X-ray diffraction, photoluminescence excitation and emission, lifetime decay and thermal quenching behavior were used to characterized the resulting samples. It was observed that the photoluminescence and thermal stability of CaSi2O2N2:Eu2+ phosphors could be obviously enhanced by co-doping Sc3+ and Lu3+ ions, especially an obvious improvement in the addition of Lu3+ ions, but not for Gd3+ and Yb3+ ions. The possible mechanism is the decrease of the nonradiative transition probability of Eu2+ ions as a result of Ln(3+) doping by the modification of crystal lattice and the increase of the solubility of Eu2+ ions.

AB A simple and effective one-step method was proposed for the fabrication of dual-mesoporous silica, which was templated by alkoxysilyl-functionalized ionic liquid and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), with potential application in alkylation of o-xylene and styrene. Ionic liquid act as both template and silica source in this system. The influence of pH of solvent and concentration of alkoxysilyl-functionalized ionic liquid to the morphology of obtained silica was studied in detail. The results showed that the as-prepared silica materials with core-shell or hollow structure could be fabricated by adjusting the pH and ionic liquid concentration, which is strongly related to the unique features of alkoxysilyl-functionalized ionic liquid with organic silicon chain. The possible mechanism was proposed based on the interaction between ionic liquid and CTAB. This new method is also applicable to synthesize the other hierarchical porous silica materials by using organic silyl functional ionic liquid. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The prepared products were characterized by XRD, SEM, and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy analyses and showed strong photo absorption in the UV and visible spectral region. The composite catalyst with 15% TiO2 showed the highest photocatalytic activity and the degradation level of solution containing 10 mg/L cadmium ions was 99.02% after photocatalytic reduction for 180 min under Xe lamp irradiation. The doping of TiO2 into calcium ferrite promoted the efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, and hence fulfilled the effective photocatalytic reduction of Cd2+ under simulated solar light irradiation.

AB The objective of this work is to develop and evaluate a powder roll-compaction procedure for fabricating cemented carbides that enables control over its surface/sub-surface grain orientation texture and grain size. The primary motivation for this work is to gain the ability to impart spatial material (property) gradients in bulk hard materials and composites for the realization of bio-inspired designs of material-systems. For this study, measured mixtures of tungsten carbide (WC) and cobalt (Co) powders were subjected to pressurized roll-compaction operations to create (malleable) thin sheets, which were then stacked and spark plasma sintered to obtain bulk cemented WC-Co specimens. When using this procedure, it was observed through XRD results that the basal plane orientation texture was increased by about 21%, and that transitions in layer-by-layer carbide grain sizes could be reliably achieved.

AB In this study, one-dimensional cesium tungsten bronze nanofibers with different crystalline phases have been successfully synthesized by electrospinning method followed by heat treatment. XRD analysis revealed that the effect of cesium content was significant on the crystal phase of the CsxWO3 nanofibers. The pure tungsten oxide nanofibers showed formation of a monoclinic phase of WO2.83. On the other hand, the XRD results of cesium doped tungsten oxide exhibit phase transitions from monoclinic, to a mixed phase (monoclinic/orthorhombic/hexagonal), to hexagonal and finally to cubic-pyrochlore with increasing the molar ration of Cs/W from 0.1 to 0.6. The SEM analysis depicted that the samples have a one-dimensional nanofiber structure and the fibers diameter increases by increasing Cs content. In addition, it is found that the synthesized sample with cesium to tungsten molar ratio of x = 0.66 have a hollow nanofiber structure. According to optical properties investigation, all samples exhibit a broad NIR absorption band from 600 nm to 1100 nm, indicating its potential application for light absorption and photocatalysis under any part of solar light available.

AB Stress-free InN nanowires (NWs) have been grown on Au/graphene/GaN/sapphire substrate by atmospheric pressure metal-In sublimation method. The phonon E-2(high) and A(1)(LO) mode in Raman spectra of InN grown on graphene is observed at 490.8 and 585 cm(-1) respectively, which is similar to that of bulk InN. The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of InN NWs shows that the interplanar spacing of (0002) and (11 - 20) are 2.85 angstrom and 1.77 angstrom, which is according with the XRD result. All the results confirm that Au-catalyst assists the growth of InN NWs, and the stress is released by the aid of the graphene inter-layer. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The controllable synthesis of novel pumpkin-like microstructure BiVO4 has been successfully obtained via a facile hydrothermal method with the aid of surfactant PVP(K30) in the present study. The effects of amount of PVP on the structure, morphology, optical and photocatalytic activity were investigated. The results revealed that the amount of PVP added in reaction mixture played a significant role in formation of pumpkin-like morphology of BiVO4. The as-prepared BiVO4 with 1.0 g PVP exhibited highest photocatalytic activity for degradation of doxycycline under visible light irradiation at room temperature. Based on the evolution process of morphology, a possible formation mechanism was proposed based on the PVP working as a soft template. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Bi2-XErXWO6 photocatalysts were synthesized by a microwave solvothermal-calcination method. The Er3+ ions were doped into the crystal of Bi2WO6 and the photocatalysts show an up-conversion effect of the Er3+ 4f electrons: I-4(15/2) -> F-4(7/2), I-4(15/2) -> H-2(11/2), I-4(15/2) -> S-4(3/2) and I-4(15/2) -> F-4(9/2). The Er3+ ions absorb NIR light and convert it into visible light so that extra photons and electrons-holes are generated. The degradation rates of the Bi2-XErXWO6 photocatalyst reach 96% within 270 min and 95% within 30 min under the simulated sunlight and NIR light, which confirms the enhancement of the degradation performance by the up-conversion effect.

AB Copper Vanadium Sulfide (Cu3VS4), also known as sulvanite, has recently emerged as a suitable absorber material for thin film photovoltaics. The synthesis of Cu3VS4 nanocrystals via a rapid solvothermal route is reported for the first time. The phase purity of the Cu3VS4 nanocrystals has been confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy, while the nanoparticle size, of about 10 nm, was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Successful ligand exchange with sulfide, an inorganic ligand, demonstrated that the nanoparticles are amenable to surface modifications, key element in solution processing.
   Further annealing of as-synthesized nanocrystals under a sulfur/argon atmosphere at 600 degrees C, rendered highly crystalline Cu3VS4 powders exhibiting an impurity that could be potentially mitigated by annealing temperature optimization. Thus, Cu3VS4, formed solely from Earth-abundant elements, could provide an inexpensive, reliable approach to fabricating solution processed thin film photovoltaic absorbers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB An electrically inactive layer (EIL) near the edge of micro-patterned graphene lines was investigated using both scanning microwave microscopy (SMM) and Raman spectroscopy. Monolayer graphene sheets grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) were transferred from the copper foil growth substrate to different substrates, and structured into periodic lines using lithography and oxygen plasma etching. SMM images were recorded at half-and quarter-wavelength resonances showing distinguished imaging contrast of the EIL from the center of the graphene lines. The width of the EIL is determined around 0.17 mu m. Correlation of the SMM imaging contrast indicates that the local electrical conductivity of the EIL is significantly reduced, which agrees with Raman spectroscopic images. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Dynamic mechanical behavior of vertically and horizontally built AlSi10Mg_200C alloy, manufactured by SLM technique was investigated at high strain rates ranging from 150 s(-1) to 1600 s(-1) using Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar. Texture of the deformed samples was measured using X-ray diffraction technique. The yield strength, peak flow stress, and ductility increased in all samples with increase of strain rate. It was concluded that deformation at high strain rates had no effect on the texture components of vertical samples. However, texture transition was observed in horizontal samples, in which strong Goss and Cube components were developed at strain rate of 1600 s(-1). The texture transition and dynamic mechanical behavior of the samples were briefly discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although all-inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 perovskites quantum dots (QDs) have garnered enormous interest in light emitting diodes, nonetheless limited attention has been paid to the perovskite-related CsPb2Br5 nanoplatelets. Herein, we prepared perovskite-related CsPb2Br5 nanoplatelets (NPLs) by a facile injection method. The synthesised CsPb2Br5 NPLs showed single tetragonal crystalline phase with a uniform square shape and a high photoluminescence (PL) emission around 520 nm (PL quantum yield (QY) > 85%). In addition, we have demonstrated the fabrication of highly efficient CsPb2Br5 NPLs-based green light emitting diodes with the highest luminance of 800 cd/m(2) and a relative low turn-on voltage of 3.0 V.

AB The additive effect of TEOS and CTAB on the HAp crystal growth and HAp/silica hybrid shape was investigated. The mesoporous silica formation on the HAp nanoparticles was successfully achieved, and the S-BET and R-BJH values were changed with the feed Ca/P ratio. The HAp/silica hybrids exhibited the higher S-BET values with the mesopores. It was suggested that the silica phase specifically interacted with the aplane of HAp and subsequently the HAp along with the c-axis direction to be anisotropic hybrid shapes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this letter, a simple and efficient cathodic electrosynthesis (CE) platform is reported for preparation of magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs). In this procedure, surface capped MNPs (with size of similar to 10 nm) were prepared from the Fe(III) nitrate/ethanol bath through CE process without using any coating agent. The prepared MNPs were characterized by different techniques of XRD, FE-SEM, TEM, FT-IR, TGA, DLS and VSM. It was found that solvent act as capping agent during the CE process, where surface of the deposited MNPs are capped with ethoxy groups i.e. -C2H5O. The VSM data proved superparamagnetic behavior of the prepared MNPs (i.e. M-s = 44.84 emu g (1), Mr = 0.21 emu g (1) and Ce = 1.38 Oe). The obtained results implied that the developed CE strategy is an effective one-pot method for preparation of surface capped MNPs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID NANOCOMPOSITES; CONTACT
AB We demonstrated a new method by preparing a large-area graphene-oxide (GO) film on the quartz plates using the double glow plasma surface alloying technology (DGPSA). The relationship between UV photoinduced wettability and tribological performance was investigated. The results indicated that GO film exhibited the special hydrophilic-hydrophobic conversion under the ultraviolet irradiation. The wettability of GO film increased from 32 degrees to 75 degrees after 5 min of irradiation, indicating a photo-induced hydrophobic surface. In view that UV irradiation induced the hydrophobicity of graphene, the friction coefficient of the obtained GO film after UV irradiation is lower than that before UV irradiation and their wear-proof properties are also improved. This work aims to confirm that the GO film prepared by DGPSA can display the obvious surface hydration behaviors and the tribological properties under the UV irradiation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit outstanding mechanical and electrical properties. However, CNT fibers (CNTFs) have still problems in realizing these properties because of the weak forces between nanotubes with many defects of individual CNTs. Here, we report a solid-state coupling reaction with an iodophenyl motif to investigate molecular covalent bridging in CNTFs. The stepwise thermochemical processes were chemical functionalization followed by thermal treatment of CNT surface to induce solid-state coupling reaction for molecular bridge of CNTFs. These molecular-bridged CNTFs presented phenomenal boost in mechanical tensile strength (0.93 N/tex) which is 132% higher than pristine CNTFs without a decrease in electrical conductivity (870 S/cm).

AB TiO2 anode presents a stable cycling performance but relatively low theoretical capacity, which has hindered its applications in high-performance Li-ion batteries (LIBs). For improving the Li storage properties, novel TiO2/Fe2O3 composite with a porous "slice on slice" structure was prepared via a facile de-alloying method. The composite delivers a reversible capacity of 838.8 mAh g(-1) after 400 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g(-1) and maintaining a discharge capacity of 339 mAh g(-1) even at 2 A g(-1). The improved Li storage property could be ascribed to the synergistic effects of the two active materials. Especially, the reduction products of Fe-0 at the interface between TiO2 and Fe2O3 can facilitate the reversibility of reactions and further result in a high reversible capacity.

In our method, the Cu foil is first annealed in high temperature air and then cooled rapidly, contaminated Cu surface layer was oxided in annealing and separated in the following cooling process, so as to get a clean Cu surface, the whole process does not require the participation of water and other reagents. Due to the influence of oxygen, the density of graphene domains on the waterless cleaning substrate is even lower than that on the polished substrate.

AB Cu nanoparticles (CuNPs) were biosynthesized by green nanotechnology and they showed a inhibitory power on the growth of Gram (+) and Gram (-). CuNPs synthesis (0) was performed at 65 degrees C from a solution of copper chloride and using as reducing cyanidine-O-3-glucoside, selectively obtained from the skin of red plum (Pronus domestic). Their characterization has shown typical UV-Vis bands, Cu nanoparticles refers to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at 550 nm. Structural analysis by HRTEM evidence growth is in the (111) plane of the fcc phase of metallic Cu, with a size close to 10 nm, with a quasi-spherical morphology, due to the role as surfactant of the cyanidine-O-3-glucoside for the preparation of metal nanoparticles.

AB Properties of Sr-1.9 xBa0.1LaxNb2O7 (SBNL; x = 0.1-0.3) thermoelectric ceramics were investigated in this study. SBNL ceramics were prepared by a reaction-sintering process with the calcinations and subsequent pulverization stages bypassed. Resistivity log rho = 8.5-9.13 Omega cm at 450 degrees C and log rho = 6.8-7.1 Omega cm at 700 degrees C were observed. Addition of Ba into Sr2Nb2O7 ceramics dramatically enhances the Seebeck coefficient S. S = -66 to -58 mu V K-1 at 200 degrees C and S = -182 to -80 mu V K-1 at temperatures around 470 degrees C for SBNL ceramics. The maximum S = -182 mu V K-1 appears at 472 degrees C for Sr1.6Ba0.1La0.3Nb2O7. kappa values at 500 degrees C are 0.91-1.215 W m(-1) K-1 for SBNL ceramics. Enhanced thermo-electric properties of Sr2Nb2O7 ceramics could be obtained with barium substitution. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Giant dielectric-constant-ceramic materials have been paid much attention for their potential applications in high-capacity capacitors due to their high energy storage density. Dielectric constants of composite materials are generally low compared with ceramic materials. In this paper, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were successfully prepared on carbon fibers (CFs) surface by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and CNTs-CFs/epoxy composites were obtained by hot-pressure molding. Effects of CVD atmosphere on composites dielectric performance were investigated. The composites exhibited a surprisingly high dielectric constant about 200,000 (60 kHz) when the ratio of C2H2, H-2 and N-2 was 6:6:12 in the CVD process. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Amorphous SiO2 film was deposited by the direct current pulsed magnetron sputtering technology, which the reciprocating motion was carried out onto the substrate. Without reciprocating motion, the resistivity of SiO2 film was only about 3.3 x 10(6) Omega.mu m. With 500 circles reciprocating motion, the resistivity increased to 1.9 x 10(9) Omega.mu m. Transmission electron microscopy results revealed that the straight line structure with lower local atomic density passed over SiO2 film, which deteriorated the resistivity seriously. The reciprocating motion of substrate could destroy above straight line structure to pass over SiO2 film, which kept SiO2 film with resistivity at 10(9) Omega.mu m. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The interfaces and erosion of oriented Fe-B alloy in flow zinc at various erosion angles were investigated. The results indicate that oriented Fe-B alloy exhibits better erosion resistance at 90 degrees erosion. Erosion angle can strongly affect erosion resistance, which depends on not only the interfacial structure but also the epitaxial zeta accumulation. Meanwhile, cavitation erosion pits and interface spallation occur, which may be suppressed by zeta accumulation at 90 degrees erosion, thus strengthening the adhesion of product films.

The particle formation is predominantly thermodynamic in nature and can be explained using the concept of nucleation induced growth mechanism. When compared to other trendy hierarchical nanostructures of CuO, these particles return appreciably higher catalytic activity for the reduction of p-nitrophenol in presence of NaBH4 as a reducing agent. The pseudo first order catalytic reaction rate constant in CuO nanoflakes is 2 times higher than hollow or solid counterparts.

AB The micro-sheets tin(II) oxide (SnO) has been synthesized using hydrothermal-alkaline solution at 95 degrees C (low temperature) under the ambient atmosphere. The as-prepared material showed a romarchite tetragonal structure without impurities. Furthermore, the study of SnO transformation has been carried out by thermal treatment ranging from 400 degrees C to 700 degrees C. The result shows that the transformation was a direct oxidation without forming any intermediate phases. The SnO started to oxidize at 400 degrees C and fully transformed into tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) at 600 degrees C. The thermal treatment has also changed the morphology and particle size of SnO from micro-sheets-structure to amorphous-flowerlike nanostructure and shifted the absorption spectra resulting in shorter UV wavelength and higher calculated-band gap.

AB In this article, we presented a novel and facile method for obtaining a photocatalyst of carbon fiber grafted with TiO2 (CF-TiO2) via "thiol-ene" click chemistry. The as-prepared CF-TiO2 was characterized by FT-IR, TGA, SEM, TEM and XRD. The results demonstrate the successful grafting of TiO2 onto the CF surface and the grafting content of TiO2 is about 9%. The photocatalytic activity of CF-TiO2 was evaluated by measuring the photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) under UV irradiation. The photodegradation rate of CF-TiO2 (89%) is significantly higher than that of pure CF (5.4%) and pure TiO2 (56%). In addition, the photostability test of CF-TiO2 demonstrates that it is reusable and stable due to strong covalent bonds between CF and TiO2. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The chitosan (CS)/cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) (0, 0.2. 0.5, 0.8 and 1 wt%) nanocomposites were applied as modifier, and then deposited on the surface of cotton fabric via a pad-dry-cure method. The morphology, mechanical, hydrophilicity and ultraviolet (UV)-blocking properties of prepared fabrics were carefully investigated. The results showed that CS/CNC could obviously enhance the UV-blocking property of cotton fabric. CS/CNC0.5 fabric exhibited the most excellent UV-blocking property as well as good washing durability after 30 times water laundering, indicating CS/CNC could be used as efficient and durable UV blocker for cotton fabric. In addition, CS/CNC also can increase the mechanical property of cotton fabric; while decrease the hydrophilicity of cotton fabric. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB MgO-Al2O3@C spheres were synthesized via a simple sacrificial templating method using resorcinol and formaldehyde. The SEM studies revealed the presence of interconnected nanosized particles within the nanoscale region. The improved CO2 sorption performance is due to the unique Mg-Al-C network which provides a favorable surface structure for the generation of unsaturated O-2. Among the samples tested, MgAl@C-1:2 shows the highest MgO carbonation conversion corresponding to 60% at 40 degrees C with improved cyclic stability for 10 cycles. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The multicomponent nitride coatings from TiZrNbAlYCr high entropy alloy (HEA) were fabricated using the vacuum-arc method. The effect of nitrogen pressure on the crystallite size, elemental and phase composition of (TiZrNbAlYCr) N coatings was investigated. A bias voltage applied to the substrate during the deposition process was -200 V. The partial nitrogen pressure was 0.05 Pa, 0.27 Pa, and 0.5 Pa. Body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice with crystallites of 15 nm in size was formed at the lowest pressure. An increase in the pressure led to the formation of the two-phase structure: BCC phase with crystallite size of 15 nm and face-centered cubic (FCC) phase with crystallite size of about 3.5 nm. The same two-phase state was found in coatings fabricated at 0.5 Pa, while the mean crystallite size was 7 nm. The maximum hardness of the deposited coatings was about 47 GPa. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Graphene oxide (GO) was modified by 4,4 '-methylenedianiline to form a nanocomposite material (GO-amine). Materials were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, derivative thermogravimetric and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical behavior of modified carbon paste electrode (CPE) with GO-amine (GO-amine/CPE) was studied by electrochemical methods. The results showed which GO-amine/CPE catalyzes oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media with an onset potential of 0.4 V (vs. Ag|AgCl|KCl3M), showing a synergistic effect between GO and amine nanocomposite. The high electrochemical stability confirmed the improved electrocatalytic performance of GO-amine. This study affords us a GO-amine based electrocatalyst with high performance and strong durability under alkaline conditions, which can be applied to energy conversion and storage.

AB Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) cannot be stably dispersed in aqueous solutions, which greatly limit their use in biomedical applications. In this study, functionalized SWCNTs were dispersed in chitosan (CS) solution, which greatly promoted the water solubility of SWCNTs and formed a uniformly dispersed solution. The use of EDC/NHS crosslinking solution to activate carboxyl groups into amino groups, greatly improved the affinity of SWCNTs for biomolecules. TEM characterization of the nanocomposites showed that SWCNTs were uniformly dispersed in CS solution. Cyclic voltammetry and electro-chemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that the nanocomposites covering the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) greatly improved the conductivity of the electrodes and enhanced the electron transfer rate. A simple electrochemical biosensor for the detection of serum leptin was successfully fabricated with the functionalized-SWCNTs-CS biopolymer nanocomposites on GCEs. The biosensor demonstrated a wide linear range (0-1000 ng mL(-1)) and a detection limit of 5 pg mL(-1) (S/N = 3). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   BEHAVIOR
AB In this paper, grain size (GS) dependence of Young's modulus and hardness for nanocrystalline NiTi shape memory alloy is investigated by experiments. Amorphous NiTi with nanocrystalline debris is fabricated via cold-rolling and polycrystalline NiTi with average GS from 10 nm to 120 nm is obtained by subsequent annealing. Young's modulus and hardness of nanocrystalline NiTi are quantified by macroscopic isothermal tension and microscopic nanoindentation. It is shown that Young's modulus of nanocrystalline NiTi first decreases (for GS < 62 nm) and then increases (for GS > 62 nm) with GS in the nano-scale region. The non-monotonic GS dependence of Young's modulus originates from the combined effects of grain size and volume fractions of austenite, martensite and amorphous phase in the material. It is also shown that with the increase of GS up to 120 nm, hardness of nanocrystalline NiTi monotonically decreases due to the reduced nominal phase transition stress and plastic yielding stress. Such GS dependence of hardness can be utilized for rapid determination of GS in nanocrystalline NiTi via nanoindentation hardness test. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of the present work was the experimental evaluation of pesticides transfer to virgin olive oil during the production step and prediction of their processing factors, which could be eventually used for the calculation of maximum residue limits (MRLs) in olive oil from the MRLs set in olives. A laboratory-scale Abencor system was used for the production of olive oil from olives spiked with the 104 pesticides studied, three different chromatographic methods being used for the analysis of raw olives and the obtained olive oil: (i) gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) for GC-amenable pesticides; (ii) hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS) for polar pesticides, and; (iii) reversed-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) for low to medium polarity pesticides. Processing factors experimentally calculated were correlated to their octanol-water partitioning coefficient (log K-ow), enabling the calculation of the equivalent MRLs in olive oil from the MRLs in olives, considering the percentage of oil extracted (oil yield) and the log K-ow of each pesticide.

AB A simple and sensitive electroanalysis method has been developed for the direct determination of lead ions of nanomolar levels in real samples of drinking water and milk by employing magnetic mesoporous thiourea-formaldehyde resin (TUF@Fe3O4) nanocomposites as the capturing absorbents. Here, the prepared TUF@ Fe3O4 with the large-surface-area mesoporous structure and strong Pb2+-binding ligands could facilitate the selective and large-scale adsorption of Pb2+ ions from the complex sample matrices to be further magnetically separated onto the magnetic electrodes. Moreover, the Pb2+ ions magnetically accumulated were electrochemically measured alternatively by the solid state-based anodic stripping of PbCl2. The detection limit was found to be 0.0070 nmol L-1. The as-developed Pb2+ electroanalysis method with the magnetic electrodes and TUF@ Fe3O4 nanocomposites could avoid the complicated sample preparation and electrode modification, thus holding the great potential of applications for the Pb2+ detection in different real samples.

AB Folic acid plays a significant role during periods of rapid cells division and growth. Pregnant women require folic acid daily, either from dietary supplements or folic acid tablets in order to prevent fetal neural tube defects. In this work, a simple coupled ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography and ion chromatography technique was developed for simultaneous determination of folic acid and inorganic anions in folic acid tablets. A reversed-phase C18 column was used as the pretreatment column for on-line separating inorganic anions from organics. Inorganic anions were concentrated in the concentration column. Under the optimal chromatographic conditions, good sensitivity and linear calibrationcurves (r >= 0.9992) were obtained. Low detection limits were obtained in the range of 0.0032-0.40 mg L-1 for all analytes. Repeatability results were satisfactory with relative standard deviations less than 1.50% (n = 5). The developed method was utilized to analyze spiked folic acid tablet samples with good measured recoveries (92.4-107.4%). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The blueberry fruit has a light-blue appearance because its blue-black skin is covered with a waxy bloom. This layer is easily damaged or removed during fruit harvesting and postharvest handling. We investigated the effects of wax removal on the postharvest quality of blueberry fruit and their possible mechanisms. The removal of natural wax on the fruit was found to accelerate the postharvest water loss and decay, reduce the sensory and nutritional qualities, and shorten the shelf-life. Wax removal decreased the activities of antioxidant enzymes and contents of antioxidants, and accelerated accumulation of ROS and lipid peroxidation, especially at the later period of storage. Moreover, the organellar membrane structure was disrupted in fruit with wax removed. These results indicate that cuticular wax plays an important role in maintaining the postharvest quality and delaying fruit senescence. The results should improve our understanding for better preservation of postharvest quality of blueberry fruit. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The formation and physicochemical stability of mixed functional components (lutein & DHA) emulsions through heteroaggregation were studied. It was formed by controlled heteroaggregation of oppositely charged lutein and DHA droplets coated by cationic lactoferrin (LF) and anionic whey protein isolate (WPI), respectively. Heteroaggregation was induced by mixing the oppositely charged LF-lutein and WPI-DHA emulsions together at pH 6.0. Droplet size, zeta-potential, transmission-physical stability, microrheological behavior and microstructure of the heteroaggregates formed were measured as a function of LF-lutein to WPI-DHA droplet ratio. Lutein degradation and DHA oxidation by measurement of lipid hydroperoxides and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were determined. Upon mixing the two types of bioactive compounds droplets together, it was found that the largest aggregates and highest physical stability occurred at a droplet ratio of 40% LF-lutein droplets to 60% WPI-DHA droplets. Heteroaggregates formation altered the microrheological properties of the mixed emulsions mainly by the special network structure of the droplets. When LF-coated lutein droplets ratios were more than 30% and less than 60%, the mixed emulsions exhibited distinct decreases in the Mean Square Displacement, which indicated that their limited scope of Brownian motion and stable structure. Mixed emulsions with LF-lutein/WPI-DHA droplets ratio of 4: 6 exhibited Macroscopic Viscosity Index with 13 times and Elasticity Index with 3 times of magnitudes higher than the individual emulsions from which they were prepared. Compared with the WPI-DHA emulsion or LF-lutein emulsion, the oxidative stability of the heteroaggregate of LF-lutein/WPI-DHA emulsions was improved. Heteroaggregates formed by oppositely charged bioactive compounds droplets may be useful for creating specific food structures that lead to desirable physicochemical properties, such as microrheological property, physical and chemical stabilities.

AB The aim of this study was to identify and compare phenolic acids, flavan-3-ols, flavonols, and anthocyanins in two the most popular interspecific hybrids of red grapes, Rondo and Regent, nowadays very popular in red wine production in Poland. The phenolic profiles of these hybrids have not yet been reported. Thirty-three phenolic compounds, including 2 flavan-3-ols, 3 phenolic acids, 5 flavonols, and 23 anthocyanins, were determined in the examined samples using the ultra-performance liquid chromatography photodiode detector-quadrupole/time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-PDA-Q/TOF-MS) method. Major differences were found in the phenolic profiles of investigated cultivars. The Regent hybrid exhibited the highest total phenolics content (27029.75 mg/kg dry matter) but Rondo was characterized by the highest concentration of anthocyanins (19342.36 mg/kg dm). The dominant fraction was anthocyanin compounds, especially acetylated > diglucosylated forms than glucosylated ones. This data represents valuable information that may be useful for oenological practices and to valorise these varieties as sources of bioactive compounds. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work reports the identification of volatile compounds involved in the particular and atypical flavor detected in Vitis vinifera red Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon wines made with grapes infected and wilted by brown rot (Plasmopara viticola). Must made from withered grapes had green aromas while red wines were marked by intense odor reminiscent of green, herbaceous notes but also figs and cooked fruit. Thanks to GC-O and GC-MS analysis, cooked fruit notes were identified as 3-methyl-2,4-nonanedione, gamma-nonalactone and gamma-decalactone, whereas herbaceous and green aromas were identified as (Z)-1,5-octadien-3-one and 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine. We show that the organoleptic impact of P. viticola is more pronounced in Merlot wines compared to Cabernet Sauvignon ones. The highest levels of 3-methyl-2,4-nonanedione (75.3 ng/L) were found in old Merlot wines made with 20% infected berries, suggesting the incidence of berry quality on the ability of a wine to age.

AB Peach juices of distinct varieties, namely yellow-and red-fleshed, and commercial and freshly blended were analyzed. The method used was based on Stir Bar Sorptive Extraction (SBSE) involving a polydimethylsiloxane-coated stir bar with thermal desorption (TD), followed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The resulting analytical data included 41 compounds belonging to several chemical classes, such as aldehydes, alcohols, lactones, terpenoids, fatty aldehydes, fatty acids and hydrocarbons. Furthermore, chemometric data treatment using unsupervised analysis (PCA) proved useful to classify peach juices on the basis of variety. Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis (SLDA) showed that a reduced number of variables (14 compounds), including lactones (6-pentyl-alpha-pyrone, gamma-decalactone, gamma-dodecalactone, and delta-dodecalactone), fatty acids (hexadecanoic acid), fatty aldehydes (tetracosanal and octacosanal), hydrocarbons (C23, C26, C27, C29, and C33), and alcohols (phytol and alpha-tocopherol), were necessary to classify the juice samples according to variety and processing conditions.

AB Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites of fungi that cause toxic and carcinogenic effects. Human exposure to multiple mycotoxins constitutes an increasing health concern due to potential mycotoxins combined effects. The presence of mycotoxins mixtures in foodstuffs as cereals has been reported over the last years, but few studies are available concerning its occurrence in cereals primarily marketed for children, a particular vulnerable population group. The present study aims to assess the co-occurrence of twenty-one mycotoxins and metabolites present in breakfast cereals primarily marketed for children in Portugal. Results showed that 96% of the analysed breakfast cereal samples were contaminated with several mycotoxins. Twenty-two combinations were identified including two to seven different mycotoxins. Conclusions pointed out an urgent need to review legislative limits in food matrices consumed by children and to perform a more accurate risk assessment of children's exposure to mycotoxins mixtures in food.

AB The accumulation of polyphenols and L-ascorbic acid was evaluated under conventional (integrated pest management, IPM) and organic farming, as means to increase the accumulation of chemoprotective compounds. The effect of genotype was considerably higher than the growing system, in fact it is determining. 'Kalvert', a high-lycopene cultivar, outstood for the accumulation of most polyphenols, though low-carotenoid cultivars with high accumulation were also detected. Organic farming significantly increased the levels of caffeic acid by 20%, but reduced those of ferulic acid and naringenin by 13% and 15% respectively. A strong interaction with the environment was detected: in Navarra the differences were limited, while in Extremadura lower contents of ferulic acid and higher contents of chlorogenic acid and rutin were found in organic farming for certain cultivars. The effect of organic farming on L-ascorbic acid was dependent on cultivar and environment and it only led to an increase in Extremadura by 58%. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Alginates from three genus of Tunisian brown algae were isolated and characterized by size exclusion chromatography and Solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Alginate from Padina pavonica (APP) had the highest molecular weight (Mw) with 147,000 g/mol while it was 85,000 g/mol for alginate from Cystoseira compressa (ACC) and 58,000 g/mol for alginate from Dictyopteris membranaceae (ADM). The mannuronate (M) to guluronate (G) ratios were estimated from spectral deconvolution of the C-13 CP/MAS spectra and the results has shown that all the extracts are mannuronic acid-rich alginates with M/G ratio increased in the order ADM - ACC - APP. An interesting gastroprotective effect was observed for the extracts; ADM and ACC exhibited the highest inhibition of gastric lesions, at 50 mg/kg, with 83.41% and 75.39% respectively. Otherwise, it has been shown that the gastroprotective effect of alginates depends mainly on their uronic acid composition. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Paullinia cupana is a plant native to Brazil that is widely used in traditional medicine as a physical and mental stimulant. It is also used worldwide to produce soft drinks. A method for the simultaneous quantitation of seven markers in guarana by HPLC-PDA was developed, and extraction methods for the determination of methylxanthines and tannins were investigated. Quantified substances were theobromine, theophylline, caffeine, catechin, epicatechin, procyanidins A2 and B2. Results confirmed the satisfactory selectivity and linearity (r(2) >= 0.99) within the mass ranges. Repeatability (RSD <= 2.80%), intermediate precision (RSD < 4.47%), accuracy (recoveries from 90.59%-104.67%), and robustness were demonstrated. Extract 1 presented the contents: 0.0177% (+/- 1.02%) for theobromine, 0.0131% (+/- 1.14%) for theophylline, 2.9429% (+/- 1.27%) for caffeine, 0.4563% (+/- 1.02%) for catechin, 0.5515% (+/- 1.05%) for epicatechin, 0.0607% (+/- 2.80%) for A2 and 0.1035% (+/- 1.39%) for B2. The method for simultaneous quantitation of seven chemical markers in guarana proved to be reliable using a simple and convenient HPLC setup. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The using of nisin to prevent foodborne pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes) from contamination has received broad attentions during meat processing. However, the application of nisin has been limited because its antibacterial activity may be inhibited by trypsin. In this study, the protective effects of soybean protein and egg white protein on antibacterial activity of nisin were evaluated. It could be concluded that exogenous trypsin decreased the antibacterial activity of nisin, soybean protein and egg white protein could keep the nisin activity from enzymolysis of trypsin. Trypsin inhibitors in soybean protein and egg white protein could protect the antibacterial activity of nisin. Nisin with soybean protein or egg white protein in cooked meat product presented better quality preservation effects than nisin alone in the presence of trypsin. The total viable counts (TVC) and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) of nisin-treated group were significantly higher than these in nisin-soybean protein-treated and nisin-egg white protein-treated groups with trypsin. This study showed the potential of using soybean protein and egg white protein to stabilize the antibacterial activity of nisin under high trypsin conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Graphene (G) modified with magnetite (Fe3O4) and sol-gel hybrid tetraethoxysilane-methyltrimethoxysi lane (TEOS-MTMOS) was used as a clean-up adsorbent in magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) for direct determination of acrylamide in various food samples prior to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Good linearity (R-2 = 0.9990) was achieved for all samples using matrix-matched calibration. The limit of detection (LOD = 3 x SD/m) obtained was 0.061-2.89 mu g kg(-1) for the studied food samples. Native acrylamide was found to be highest in fried potato with bright-fleshed (900.81 mu g kg(-1)) and lowest in toasted bread (5.02 mu g kg(-1)). High acrylamide relative recovery (RR = 82.7-105.2%) of acrylamide was obtained for spiked (5 and 50 mu g kg(-1)) food samples. The Fe3O4@G-TEOS-MTMOS is reusable up to 7 times as a clean-up adsorbent with good recovery (> 85%). The presence of native acrylamide was confirmed by mass analysis at m/z = 71 ([C3H5NO](+)) and m/z = 55 ([C3H3O](+)). (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We report the LC-ESI-MS/MS determination of betaines in commercial flours of cereals and pseudocereals most utilized in human nutrition. Results showed that glycine betaine, trigonelline, proline betaine, Ne-trimethyllysine were metabolites common to all examined flours, whereas an uncommon betaine, valine betaine, and glutamine betaine were present only in flours of barley, rye, oat, durum wheat, winter wheat, Triticum dicoccum and Triticum monococcum. Valine betaine and glutamine betaine, the latter never reported before in plants and animals, are not evenly distributed in the Poaceae family, but their presence or absence in flours depends on the subfamily to which the plant belongs. Interestingly, we also report for the first time the occurrence of pipecolic acid betaine (homostachydrine) and its precursor 1,2-N-methylpipecolic acid in rye flour. These two metabolites were not detected in any other cereal or pseudocereal flour, suggesting their potential role as markers of rye flour occurrence in cereal-based foods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The objectives of this research were to determine the phenolic contents, oxygen radical absorbance capacities (ORAC), cellular antioxidant activities (CAA), and antiproliferative capacities of nine oat varieties and four brans in China. Of all varieties, Longyan 3 and Beiyan 1 exhibited the highest total avenan-thramides (146.94 +/- 7.31 and 120.95 +/- 6.66 mu g/g, respectively) and ORAC values (21.03 +/- 0.56 and 21.18 +/- 1.45 mu M Trolox/g, respectively), while Shaotong exhibited the highest total phenolic acids (143.52 +/- 9.42 mu g/g) and CAA values (33.38 +/- 1.74 mu M quercetin/100 g). The EC50 of antiproliferative capacities ranged from 167.31 +/- 6.42 to 233.42 +/- 21.31 mu g/mL, with the lowest in Beixiao 8 while the highest in Jinyan 8. ORAC values correlated with avenanthramides while CAA values correlated with phenolic acids. Moreover, phenolic contents, antioxidant properties, and antiproliferative capacities of oat brans was higher than that of corresponding whole oats in most cases. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Free asparagine concentration, which is the determining factor for acrylamide-forming potential in cereals, was measured in grain from wheat grown in field trials in the United Kingdom in 2011-2012 and 2012-2013. There were 25 varieties in 2012 and 59 in 2013, with eleven present in both trials. The trials were split-plot, with half of each plot supplied with sulphur and the other half not. The varietal means (mmol per kg) for free asparagine in the sulphur-fed wheat ranged from 1.521 to 2.687 in 2011-2012 and 0.708 to 11.29 in 2012-2013. Eight varieties were identified as having consistently low free asparagine concentration. There was a differential response of varieties to sulphur, and much higher levels of free asparagine in 2012-2013 versus 2011-2012. Given the short commercial lifespan of some wheat varieties, it is concluded that information on free asparagine concentration should be made available when a variety is launched.

AB The impact of pH on the physicochemical properties of 10% menhaden oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions containing 2% whey protein isolate (WPI) and 0.1% xanthan (XG)-locust bean gum (LBG) mixtures was investigated. The O/W emulsions containing 0.1% XG-LBG mixtures were compared to emulsions with 0.1% XG and 0.1% LBG. The results indicated that stability is dependent on pH and biopolymer type. At both pH 3 and 5, emulsions containing either XG or XG-LBG mixtures had large particle sizes, viscosity, droplet aggregation, and creaming index, resulting in poor physical stability which can be related to the adsorbed protein-polysaccharide interactions. At pH7, the XG-LBG emulsions showed the greatest resistance to phase separation and resulted in stable emulsions. Lipid oxidation measurements also indicated that XG-LBG mixtures can be used to form stable emulsions at pH 3 and pH 7. These results have significant implications for the development of novel structures containing lipid phases susceptible to lipid oxidation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A novel and simple ionic liquid-based air-assisted liquid-liquid microextraction technique combined with high performance liquid chromatography was developed to analyze five fungicides in juice samples. In this method, ionic liquid was used instead of a volatile organic solvent as the extraction solvent. The emulsion was formed by pulling in and pushing out the mixture of aqueous sample solution and extraction solvent repeatedly using a 10 mL glass syringe. No organic dispersive solvent was required. Under the optimized conditions, the limits of detection (LODs) were 0.4-1.8 mu g L-1 at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. The limits of quantification (LOQs) set as the lowest spiking levels with acceptable recovery in juices were 10 mu g L-1, except for fludioxonil whose LOQ was 20 mu g L-1. The proposed method was applied to determine the target fungicides in juice samples, and acceptable recoveries ranging from 74.9% to 115.4% were achieved. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Thermal degradation kinetics of lutein, zeaxanthin, beta-cryptoxanthin, beta-carotene was studied at 25, 35, and 45 degrees C in a model system. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of all-trans-and cis-carotenoids were conducted using HPLC-DAD-MS technologies. Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters were calculated by non-linear regression. A total of 29 geometrical isomers and four oxidation products were detected, including all-trans-, keto compounds, mono-cis-and di-cis-isomers. Degradations of all-trans-lutein, zeaxanthin, beta-cryptoxanthin, and beta-carotene were described by a first-order kinetic model, with the order of rate constants as k(beta-carotene) > k(beta-cryptoxanthin) > k(lutein) > k(zeaxanthin). Activation energies of zeaxanthin, lutein, beta-cryptoxanthin, and beta-carotene were 65.6, 38.9, 33.9, and 8.6 kJ/moL, respectively. cis-carotenoids also followed with the first-order kinetic model, but they did not show a defined sequence of degradation rate constants and activation energies at different temperatures. A possible degradation pathway of four carotenoids was identified to better understand the mechanism of carotenoid degradation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Food authenticity is an issue of major concern for food authorities, as mislabeling represents one of the major commercial frauds. In this study, a novel PCR-RFLP protocol was developed as a tool to authenticate four shrimp products of commercial importance belonging to the family, Penaeidae, viz. Litopenaeus vannamei, Penaeus monodon, P. semisulcatus and Fenneropenaeus indicus. PCR amplification was performed targeting 16S rRNA/tRNA(val) region having an amplicon size of 530 bp using the specific primers for shrimps, 16S-Cru4/16S-Cru3. Subsequent restriction analysis with a single restriction enzyme, Tsp5091, yielded distinct RFLP pattern for each species of shrimps having fragment sizes below 150 bp. The unique RFLP patterns were also obtained in processed shrimp products without any degradation or alteration in the major fragments. The method was also validated with commercial shrimp products. Thus, the developed protocol can be performed within 8 h using a single enzyme to authenticate four shrimp products of commercial significance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Teff (Eragrostis tef) is a cereal native to Ethiopia and Eritrea. It has an excellent adaptability to harsh environmental conditions and plays an important role in food security. In recent years, teff is becoming globally popular due to the attractive nutritional profile such as gluten free and high dietary fiber content. This review documents the recent advances in the genetic diversity, nutritional composition and food uses of teff grain. The attractive nutrients of teff include protein, dietary fiber, polyphenols, and certain minerals. Whole grain teff flour becomes increasingly important in healthy food market, and has been used to produce various gluten free food items such as pasta and bread. Efforts have been made to enhance the sensory quality of teff based products. There is great potential to adapt teff to the other parts of the world for healthy food and beverage production.

AB To isolate a novel peptide with specific calcium-binding capacity, wheat germ protein was hydrolyzed. The hydrolysates were purified using ultrafiltration, anion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequence of the purified peptide was determined and confirmed to be FVDVT (Phe-Val-Asp-Val-Thr). The calcium-binding capacity of FVDVT reached 89.94 +/- 0.75%, increased by 86.37% compared to the hydrolysates. The chelating mechanism between FVDVT and calcium was further investigated by Ultraviolet-Visible absorption spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonances spectroscopy. The results indicated that the oxygen atoms of the carboxy group and the nitrogen atoms of the amido group provided major binding sites. In addition, aspartic acid and threonine show considerable capacity for incorporating with calcium by donating electron pairs. This study provides a feasible approach to isolate calcium-binding peptides and to clarify the possible binding mechanism of calcium and peptide. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We prepared solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) with tristearin and various emulsifiers which had different chain length PEGs (10-100 times-repetition of ethylene glycol) to control their digestion fate in the gastrointestinal tract. Fabricated SLNs after acidic/high-ionic-strength media treatment were stable regardless of the f-potential (ZP) disappearance. Additionally, highly PEGylated SLNs successfully hindered the adsorption of both bile acid (BA) and lipase on the SLN surface, while lowly PEGylated SLNs interrupted that of only lipase. In simulated small intestinal fluid, lipolysis of highly PEGylated SLNs increased with decrease of the emulsifier density on the SLNs, whereas lipolysis of lowly PEGylated SLNs increased with decrease of the particle size. These results suggested that high PEGylation was more efficient than low PEGylation to hinder the lipolysis initiated from the competitive replacement of the SLN-covering emulsifiers with BAs. Consequently, the SLN digestion could be controlled by choosing the length and concentration of PEGylated emulsifiers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Smooth-hound viscera hydrolysates (SHVHs) were prepared by treatment with Neutrase (SHVH-N) and Purafect (SHVH-P). Hydrolysates were then separated according to their molecular weight, using the ultra-filtration membrane system, into 5 fractions (>= 50, 50-5, 5-3, 3-1 and <= 1 kDa). Fractions showed different amino acid compositions and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory potentials. The SHVH-P-FV (<= 1 kDa) and SHVH-N-FIV (3-1 kDa) fractions showed the best ACE-inhibitory activities with IC50 values of 53.31 and 75.05 mu g/ml, respectively. According to their high ACE-inhibitory potential, FIV and FV were fractionated by RP-HPLC and then analyzed by LC-MS/MS to identify peptide sequences. A systematic peptidomic study resulted in the identification of numerous novel sequences. Furthermore, in silico data, based on the molecular docking simulation, showed that GPAGPRGPAG, AVVPPSDKM, TTMYPGIA, and VKPLPQSG could bind ACE active site with low interaction scores. Indeed, they share hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals and electrostatic interactions with ACE catalytic pockets. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this work was to extract gelatin from skin of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and to study its functional properties and application in ice-cream and beer. SDS-PAGE patterns showed that channel catfish gelatin (CCG) had more high molecular weight components (beta and gamma chains) than had calf bone gelatin (CBG). The viscosity of CCG was 42 mPa. s at 10 degrees C, which was three times more than that of CBG. Compared to CBG, CCG presented higher emulsion capacity and stability, as well as higher foaming stability. CCG conferred the ice-cream samples and beer with better mouth feel and clarification effect, respectively. The results indicated that CCG had great potential to be utilized in the food industry.

AB Human jejunal digests after oral ingestion of casein and whey protein were collected by a nasogastric tube and protein degradation and peptide release was compared with that found in the digests of the same substrates using a standardised protocol. No intact casein was detected in the jejunal nor in the in vitro samples taken during the intestinal phase, while beta-lactoglobulin was found in one hour-jejunal samples in agreement with the in vitro digestion. In vivo and in vitro digests showed comparable peptide profiles and high number of common sequences. A selective precipitation step was used to strengthen the identification of phosphorylated peptides. Most of the sequences found in jejunum, some of them not previously described, were also identified in the simulated digests. Common resistant regions to digestion were identified, revealing that the in vitro protocol constitutes a good approximation to the physiological gastrointestinal digestion of milk proteins.

AB Medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) ethyl esters, as yeast secondary metabolites, significantly contribute to the fruity aroma of foods and beverages. To improve the MCFA ethyl ester content of wine, mixed fermentations with Hanseniaspora uvarum Yun268 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were performed. Final volatiles were analyzed by gas solid phase microextraction-chromatography-mass spectrometry, and aroma characteristics were quantitated by sensory analysis. Results showed that mixed fermentation increased MCFA ethyl ester content by 37% in Cabernet Gernischt wine compared to that obtained by pure fermentation. Partial least-squares regression analysis further revealed that the improved MCFA ethyl esters specifically enhanced the temperate fruity aroma of wine. The enhancement of MCFA ethyl esters was attributed to the increased contents of MCFAs that could be induced by the presence of H. uvarum Yun268 in mixed fermentation. Meanwhile, the timing of yeast inoculations significantly affected the involving biomass of each strain and the dynamics of ethanol accumulation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cyanamide is widely used in agriculture, and has a modest toxicity in humans. In the present study, a simple, sensitive, and widely applicable method for detecting cyanamide in 21 plant-derived foods was developed. In the proposed method, after the samples were homogenized and extracted, the method employs clean-up with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and derivatization with dansyl chloride. The derivatized sample extracts were quantified with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The mean recoveries were in the range of 67.4%-107.1%, and the RSDs were between 1.0% and 17.8%. The quantification limit in shiitake, green tea and chinese pepper was 0.05 mg/kg, and in others 18 plant-derived foods was 0.01 mg/kg. Among the data of 5 different laboratories, the repeatability limits (r) ranged from 0.0010 to 0.0941, and the reproducibility limits (R) ranged from 0.0031 to 0.2667. Moreover, the repeatability among different testing personnels in the same laboratory also has been examined. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of ultrasound (US) frequency, addition of Lactobacillus sakei culture and drying time on key nutritional (protein, amino acids, and organic acids) and physicochemical properties (texture and colour) of cultured and uncultured beef jerky were evaluated. Cultured and uncultured jerky samples were subjected to US frequencies of 25 kHz, 33 kHz and 45 kHz for 30 min prior to marination and drying. Principal component analysis demonstrated a significant effect of beef jerky processing conditions on physicochemical properties. Taurine content of jerky samples was found to increase with an increase in ultrasonic frequencies for cultured samples. No significant changes in colour values were observed for ultrasound pre-treated and control samples. Interactive effects of culture treatment, drying and ultrasonic frequency were observed. This study demonstrates that the nutritional profile of beef jerky can be improved through the incorporation of L. sakei. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the effect of six different starter cultures of enterobacteria on the concentration of residual nitrite in fermented sausages during in vitro human digestion. Before digestion, the concentration of residual nitrite was dependent on starter culture in fermented sausage and ranged from 25.2 to 33.2 mg/kg. Among the six starter cultures of enterobacteria, Pediococcus acidilactici, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Staphylococcus carnosus showed higher nitrite depletion ability than the other three strains in fermented sausages. The concentration of residual nitrite in fermented sausages was significantly (p < 0.05) decreased after stomach digestion and ranged from 17.4 to 21.6 mg/kg. Enterobacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli) and/or Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) effectively increased the degree of depletion of residual nitrite in large intestine digestion. In conclusion, starter cultures could influence the concentration of residual nitrite during in vitro human digestion. They could deplete residual nitrite in fermented sausages.

AB The impact of alkali addition on the degree of gluten polymerization and textural characteristics of textured wheat protein was investigated. Results showed that the extrusion process increased the average molecular weight of gluten as evidenced by SDS-PAGE and SDS extractable protein. The addition of alkali not only promoted the degree of gluten polymerization, but also induced dehydroalanine-derived cross-linking. Alkali addition decreased the content of cystine and increased the contents of dehydroalanine and lanthionine. The obvious decrease of free SH showed that dehydroalanine-derived cross-linking was quantitatively less crucial than disulfide cross-linking. Furthermore, the protein cross-linking induced by alkali improved the texture properties of gluten extrudates. SEM analysis showed extrusion under alkaline condition conferred a more fibrous microstructure as a consequence of a compact gluten network. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a novel galactomannoglucan named as TJ2 was isolated from Agaricus brasiliensis with microwave extraction, macroporous resin, ion exchange resin and high resolution gel chromatography. TJ2 is composed of glucose, mannose and galactose in the ratio 99.2:0.2:0.6. Infrared spectra (IR), methylation analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra indicated that TJ2 mainly contained a beta-(1 -> 3)-linked glucopyranosyl backbone. Interestingly, TJ2 significantly promoted RAW264.7 cell proliferation, and was able to activate the cells to engulf E. coli. In addition, TJ2 induced the expression of Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) in the cells. TJ2 also promoted the production of nitric oxide (NO) by inducing the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).

AB Flavor stability of hard tea beverage was investigated over eight weeks of storage. The volatile compounds were analyzed using solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) and two-dimensional GC-MS. Quantitative analysis showed that the concentrations of linalool, citronellol, geranial, neral, geraniol, and nerol decreased dramatically during storage, whereas alpha-terpineol showed an increasing trend during storage. Heart-cut two-dimensional GC-MS (2D-GC-MS) chirality analysis showed that (R)-(+)-limonene, (R)-(-)-linalool, (S)-(-)-alpha-terpineol and (S)-(-)-4-terpineol dominated in the fresh hard tea samples, however, the configuration changed during storage for the terpene alcohols. The storage conditions did not change the configuration of limonene. A conversion of (R)-(-)-linalool to (S)-(+) form was observed during storage. Both (S)-alpha-terpineol and (S)-4-terpineol dominated at beginning of the storage, but (R)-(+)-alpha-terpineol became dominated after storage, suggested in addition to isomerization from (S)-alpha-terpineol, other precursors could also generate alpha-terpineol with (R)-isomer preference.

In the three studied fruits, 22 phenolic compounds were quantified, especially phenolic acids and flavonoids, which presented a higher concentration in the intermediate ripening stage. In contrast, the total monomeric anthocyanin, fructose, glucose, Ca, Na values were higher in the ripe stage. In addition, all studied fruits showed expressive antioxidant capacity in both ripening stages: 2569.28 to 5066.35 mg AAE 100 g(-1) DW for DPPH; 13777.52 to 26667.45 mu mol Fe+2 100 g(-1) DW for FRAP; and 957.72 to 2061.35 mg GAE 100 g(-1) DW for Folin-Ciocalteu reducing capacity. Therefore, our results revealed that these fruits represent a supply of high-value nutrient and bioactive components, especially in the ripe stage. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An environmentally friendly method for the phenolic compound extraction from agro-food industrial by-products was developed in order to contribute with their sustainable valorization. A Natural Deep Eutectic Solvent was chemometrically-designed for the first time and compared with traditional solvents in terms of analyte stabilization. The combination of lactic acid, glucose and 15% water (LGH-15) was selected as optimal. A high-efficiency ultrasound-assisted extraction mediated by LGH-15 prior to HPLC-DAD allows the determination of 14 phenols in onion, olive, tomato and pear industrial byproducts. NADES synthesis as well as the extraction procedures were optimized by Response Surface Methodology. Thus, phenolic determination in these complex samples was achieved by a simple, non-expensive, eco-friendly and robust system. The application to different matrices demonstrated the versatility of the proposed method. NADES opens interesting perspectives for their potential use as vehicles of bioactive compounds as food additives or pharmaceuticals. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The combination of antifungal agents (cinnamon bark oil, zinc gluconate and trans-ferulic acid) in oil-in-water emulsions to control the fungal spoilage of strawberry jams, minimising essential oil's sensory impact, was evaluated in this work. The in vitro assays of free antifungal agents were performed against five fungal strains; meanwhile, the emulsions assays were conducted against Aspergillus niger given its strong resistance and its relevance in strawberry products. The emulsion formulated with 0.08 mg/g of essential oil was able to inhibit mould growth after the incubation period. The incorporation of zinc gluconate or trans-ferulic acid, independently of the concentration used, allowed to reduce a 25% the amount of essential oil needed to inhibit the microbial growth. The combination of antifungal agents in the emulsions has demonstrated to be an effective alternative to reduce the amount of essential oil employed, maintaining the hygienic quality and sensory profile of the strawberry jam.

AB This research tested furan classification models in fried matrices based on the pattern recognition of images. Samples were fried at 150, 160, 170, 180, and 190 degrees C for 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 30 min. Furan was measured by GC-MS. Corresponding images were acquired and processed to extract 2175 chromatic and textural features. Principal component analysis was used to reduce features to 8-12 principal components. In parallel, sequential forward selection coupled with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was the best strategy to select only 5-7 features. LDA was the best classifier with 91.39-97.60% recognizing above 113 mu g/kg and 69.54-83.80% to classify images from class 1 (0-38 mu g/kg) from class 2 (39-113 mu g/kg). Also, support vector machine recognized 87.71-96.74% of class 3 (114-398 mu g/kg) from class 4 (399-646 mg/kg). The technique may be used to detect high amount of furan in fried starchy matrices.

AB Soluble-free, soluble-conjugated, insoluble-bound phenolics and antioxidant activity, flavonoid (TFC), proanthocyanidins (TPAC), anthocyanins and minerals of fifteen whole rice grains with different colors were investigated. Soluble-free protocatechuic and vanillic acids were only quantified in black rice, which had the most quantities. Non-pigmented rice had no detectable conjugated protocatechuic and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acids both of which were found in black and red rice, respectively. The main bound phenolic acids were ferulic and p-coumaric, as well as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic in red rice and protocatechuic and vanillic acids in black rice. Soluble-conjugated phenolics, TFC, and anthocyanins were negatively correlated with L*, b*, C and H degrees values. TPAC was positively correlated with a* (P < 0.01). Protocatechuic, vanillic, syringic and ferulic acids were associated with TPC and antioxidant activity in the soluble-conjugated fraction while protocatechuic and ferulic acid were correlated with those in the insoluble-bound fraction. Principal component analysis divided samples into non-pigmented, red and black rice groups. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objectives of this research were to study tuber starch characteristics and chemical - thermal properties of 21 potato varieties, and to determine their genetic diversity through SSR markers. Starch granular size varied among samples, with a wide diameter distribution (5-85 lm), while granule shapes were similar. Differential Scanning Calorimeter analysis showed that the transition temperatures (69 degrees C-74 degrees C) and enthalpies of gelatinization (0.9 J/g-3.8 J/g) of tubers were also variety dependent. SSR analysis allowed the detection of 157 alleles across all varieties, with an average value of 6.8 alleles per locus. Variety-specific alleles were also identified. SSR-based cluster analysis revealed that varieties with interesting quality attributes were distributed among all clusters and sub-clusters, suggesting that the genetic basis of traits analyzed may differ among our varieties. The information obtained in this study may be useful to identify and develop varieties with slowly digestible starch. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Thiabendazole, a systemic fungicide used to treat vegetables and fruits during postharvest process, persists as detrimental residue to consumers. We combine a molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) with surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to form a novel MISPE-SERS chemosensor and determined thiabendazole in orange juice. Kinetic and static adsorption tests validated the efficient and selective adsorption of thiabendazole using synthesized MIPs via precipitation polymerization. Synthesized MIPs were packed into solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge to serve as tailor-made sorbents for the separation of thiabendazole in orange juice. Silver colloids synthesized by reduction of AgNO3 by trisodium citrate were used as SERS-active substrate to quantify the eluted thiabendazole from MISPE. The overall process including sample preparation and detection took 23 min and the limit of detection of this chemosensor was 4 ppm for thiabendazole in orange juice. This chemosensor can be used for rapid and sensitive detection of thiabendazole in agri-foods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sensory and nutritional properties of dry-cured ham can be negatively affected due to oxidative modifications of muscle proteins during its processing. In this study, a peptidomic approach has been used in order to study the evolution of oxidised peptides generated throughout the dry-curing process ( 0, 2, 3.5, 5, 6.5 and 9 months), focusing on those derived from major myofibrillar proteins. A total of 67 peptides showing methionine, proline, and tryptophan oxidations were identified in common in all samples by nano liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry for their relative quantification using a label-free methodology, showing the hydrolysis of some of the peptides during the process. So, the peptidomics strategy used in this work has resulted to be very useful as a complementary tool to the methods currently used to study protein oxidation, allowing a better understanding of the oxidation at peptide level and the influence of ham processing conditions.

AB Egg yolk low density lipoprotein (LDL)/polysaccharide nanogels are newly explored as oral delivery systems with promising encapsulation potentials. Nonetheless, the stability of nanogels against aggregation in gastrointestinal tract remains a challenge. Therefore, chemical crosslinking by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) and scarbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS) was adopted to improve the gastrointestinal stability of nanogels. Compared to original uncrosslinked nanogels, crosslinking did not change particle size, polydispersity index (PDI) and morphology, but it reduced surface charge of nanogels. The nano spray dried LDL/CMC/EDC nanogels had relatively poor surface structure with agglomerations. The FT-IR spectra confirmed the formation of new peptide bonds, which significantly improved stability of nanogels under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. Fluorescence spectra evidenced that non-polar microenvironment for curcumin embedded in nanogels was strengthened, which therefore enhanced encapsulation efficiency. Moreover, curcumin exhibited sustained release profile from crosslinked nanogels in simulated gastrointestinal fluids. Overall, our study provided a promising strategy to enhance the stability of LDL-based nanogels in digestive conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the study was to analyze the influence of natural antioxidants on polymerization of partially hydrogenated rapeseed oil heated in 170 degrees C for 40 h. In the research ethanolic extracts of green tea leaves (China Lung Ching), yellow tea leaves (China Kakecha), cranberry, blackberry, and lime were used. The yellow and green tea extracts were characterized by the highest content of total polyphenol and antioxidant activity. Polymers of triacylglycerols were found only in the polar fraction of heated oil. During heating, the increase of dimers, trimers, and oligomers was observed. However, it was dependent on the used additives and not directly related to the content of phenolic compounds and their antioxidant activity. The final content of polymers in oil samples increased in the fallowing order: green tea < yellow tea < blackberry < BHT < cranberry < lemon < oil without additives. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study confirmed the possibility of biopolymer-type stabilizers to increase the saturation concentration of branched-chain amino acids by preventing their crystallization/precipitation. Although microfluidization increased the initial solubility, it failed to increase the saturation concentration of the branchedchain amino acids. The saturation concentration of the branched-chain amino acids increased from 3.81% to 4.42% and 4.85% after the incorporation of food hydrocolloids and proteins, respectively. However, the branched-chain amino acids: stabilizer ratio did not affect the solubility. In the case of food hydrocolloidbased solutions, crystal formation and growth of branched-chain amino acids occurred during storage, resulting in the precipitation of branched-chain amino acid crystals. However, food proteins effectively increased the stability of the solubilized branched-chain amino acids. The improved solubility and stability of the solubilized branched-chain amino acids could be attributed to interactions between the functional groups (carboxyl, amine, sulfate, aliphatic, aromatic, etc.) of the stabilizer and the branched-chain amino acid molecules.

AB beta-Cyclodextrin (beta-CD) modified magnetic graphene oxide material (Fe3O4@SiO2/GO/beta-CD), a novel magnetic sorbent for enrichment and purification of plant growth regulators (PGRs) in vegetables prior to gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC-MS) detection, was successfully fabricated. The novel magnetic sorbent geometrically fitted to selectively recognize and enrich PGR analytes especially containing aromatic structure. The selectivity experiment demonstrated the higher selectivity of Fe3O4@SiO2/GO/ beta-CD toward 5 PGR compounds than that of Fe3O4@SiO2/GO. Several parameters affecting extraction efficiency including the volume of extraction solvent, amount of adsorbent, extraction time, type and the volume of desorption solvent were optimized. Under the optimized condition, good linear relationships were obtained in the range of 1-100 lg/kg with determination coefficients (R-2) from 0.9983 to 0.9996. The limits of detection (LODs) of 5 PGRs were from 0.04 to 0.28 mu g/kg. The proposed method had good potential for the analysis of trace level of 5 PGRs in real vegetable samples.

AB In the present study, chemical composition and bioactivity of Cichorium spinosum leaves were examined at different growth stages for optimum harvest stage and end-use assessment. Total fresh weight and number of leaves were higher at 4th growth stage; however, at this stage the end-use is not indicated for raw consumption but mostly for pickled or dried products. Regarding chemical composition, the highest content of tocopherols and minerals was observed in the 1st growth stage, whereas sugars content was the highest in 3rd and 4th growth stage. Polyunsaturated fatty acids content was the highest during the first two growth stages, whereas antioxidant activity, phenolic acids and total phenolic compounds content in the 3rd stage. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that chemical composition of C. spinosum is highly depended on development stage, and harvest stage should be considered for alternative uses of end-products with high bioactivity.

AB Ginger (Zingiberis Rhizoma), a commonly-consumed food supplement, is often sulphur-fumigated during post-harvest handling, but it remains unknown if sulphur fumigation induces chemical transformations in ginger. In this study, the effects of sulphur fumigation on ginger chemicals were investigated by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS)-based metabolomics. The results showed that sulphur fumigation significantly altered the holistic chemical profile of ginger by triggering chemical transformations of certain original components. 6-Gingesulphonic acid, previously reported as a naturally-occurring component in ginger, was revealed to be a sulphur fumigation-induced artificial derivative, which was deduced to be generated by electrophilic addition of 6-shogaol to sulphurous acid. Using UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS extracting ion analysis with 6-gingesulphonic acid as a characteristic chemical marker, all the commercial ginger samples inspected were determined to be sulphur-fumigated. The research outcomes provide a chemical basis for further comprehensive safety and efficacy evaluations of sulphur-fumigated ginger. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Non-Saccharomyces yeasts may contribute to enrich wine aroma while promoting the formation of stable pigments. Yeast metabolites such as acetaldehyde and pyruvate participate in the formation of stable pigments during fermentation and wine aging. This work evaluated the formation of polymeric pigments in red musts added with (+)-Catechin, ProcyanidinB2 and ProcyanidinC1. The non-Saccharomyces yeasts used were Lachancea thermotolerans, Metschnikowia pulcherrima and Torulaspora delbrueckii in sequential fermentation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Use of Lachancea thermotolerans led to larger amounts of polymeric pigments in sequential fermentation. (+)-Catechin is the flavanol prone to forming such pigments. The species Metschnikowia pulcherrima produced higher concentration of esters and total volatile compounds. The sensory analysis pointed out differences in fruitiness and aroma quality. The results obtained strengthen the fact that metabolites from non-Saccharomyces yeasts may contribute to form stable polymeric pigments while also influencing wine complexity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The study investigated the possibility of using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in the spectral range of 1000-2200 nm to characterize myofibrils cold structural deformation degrees of frozen pork samples. The HSI images of pork samples frozen under different freezing rates were acquired in the frozen state without thawing. The myofibrils cold structural deformation degrees were evaluated by surface hydrophobicity (S(0)ANS) and Ca2+-ATPase activity. Spectral angle mapping (SAM) algorithm was used for the first time to extract the spectral information for regression. Compared with the optimized partial least square regression (PLSR) models based on selected wavebands by successive projections algorithm (SPA), the optimized PLSR models developed based on the spectral angles calculated by the SAM algorithm achieved comparable or even better performance with R-P(2) of 0.896 for S(0)ANS and 0.879 for Ca2+-ATPase activity, respectively. The implications of the frozen meat spectrum were also analyzed in the current study. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soluble proteins were extracted from common wheat flour obtained from nine cultivars of different qualities and were analyzed by nanoUPLC and Ultra Definition Mass Spectrometry (UDMSE) label-free quantitative approach. Collectively, 5894 proteins were identified and quantified with 8 peptides/protein. A total of 414 proteins were found differentially expressed with 85% proteins not yet described in the literature, according to their biological function. Quality-related proteins, such as puroindolines and chaperones, notably involved in the gluten-protein folding process, were up-regulated in superior (SP) and medium (MD) flours qualities and down-regulated in the low (LW) ones. Domains related to the chaperones activity were also found up-regulated in SP and MD and down-regulated in LW. In this work, nanoUPLC-UDMSE analysis was effective to identify and quantify metabolic proteins, allowing a clear distinction of the wheat flours and providing new perspectives for evaluating the technological quality based on the low abundant proteins of wheat endosperm.

AB The effects of hydrocolloids (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), xanthan gum (XG), and apple pectin (AP)) at different concentrations on dough thermo-mechanical properties and in vitro starch digestibility of gluten-free potato steamed bread were investigated. Results showed that hydrocolloids addition significantly increased the gelatinization temperature (from 52.0 to 64.2 degrees C) and water absorption (from 56.22 to 66.50%) of potato dough. Moreover, hydrocolloids may be interacted with protein and starch, the density of potato protein bands was decreased by hydrocolloids addition, the reason might be that higher molecular weight complexes might be formed between proteins-hydrocolloids or proteins-proteins, thus change the protein solubility. Furthermore, steamed breads with hydrocolloids presented higher specific volume and lower hardness, and the rapidly digestible starch and estimated glycemic index were significantly decreased from 45.51 to 20.64, from 69.54 to 55.17, respectively. In conclusion, HPMC and XG could be used as improvers in the gluten-free potato steamed bread. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Most often, the immobilized enzyme based quantification is an attractive alternative to other chromatographic, electrochemical and mass spectrometry based methods due to its specificity and simplicity. In the present study, polyamine oxidase specific for spermine and spermidine and diamine oxidase specific for putrescine, were co-immobilized onto a novel chitosan/coconut fibre/zinc oxide nanoparticles (CS/CF/nZnO) hybrid support to yield a polyamine sensing strip. The strip worked optimally at pH 7.0, temperature 25 degrees C and 6 min of incubation time. Pretty good values for kinetic constants Km(app) (6.60 mM), Vmax (17.69 mu mol/min mg protein) and kcat(app) (1987.64 s(-1)) as well as for thermal (<50 % activity retained at 40 degrees C), storage (half life-40 days) and operational stabilities (<90 % activity retained after 20 reuses) were obtained. The strip was employed for polyamine determination in some of the locally grown fruit and vegetables and the results were found to be comparable, reliable and reproducible. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Free concentrations of Zn2+, Fe3+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ in a red wine (Raimat, Catalonia, Spain) have been determined, with the Donnan Membrane Technique (DMT) for the first time. The required equilibration time benefits from the acceptor solution including major cations. K+ and Na+, mainly unbound to any ligand in the sample, have been identified as suitable reference ions. A free Zn concentration of 1.76 mu mol L-1 determined with DMT was in excellent agreement with the free Zn concentration independently provided by the electroanalytical technique Absence of Gradients and Nernstian Equilibrium Stripping (AGNES), 1.7 mu mol L-1, amounting to 14.4% of the total Zn. The free concentrations found in this wine were 1.79 mu mol L-1 Fe3+, 1.11 mmol L-1 Ca2+ and 3.4 mmol L-1 Mg2+ (8.82%, 40% and 57% of their total concentrations). Prior to the application of the techniques to the red wine, they had been crossvalidated in Zn-tartrate solutions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Enzymatic browning limits the postharvest life of minimally processed foods, thus the study selected the optimal inhibitors of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and evaluated their effect on enzymatic browning, phenolics and antioxidant capacity of stored mung bean sprouts. The sprouts treated with 2 mM and 20 mM ascorbic acid had a lowered PPO activity; compared to the control by 51% and 60%, respectively. The inhibition was reflected in a significant decrease in enzymatic browning. The sprouts treated with 20 mM ascorbic acid had 22% and 23% higher phenolic content after 3 and 7 days of storage, respectively. Both storage and ascorbic acid treatment increased potential bioaccessibility of phenolics. Generally, there was no effect of the treatments on the antioxidant capacity; however, a significant increase in the reducing potential was determined for the sprouts washed with 20 mM ascorbic acid. In conclusion, ascorbic acid treatments may improve consumer quality of stored sprouts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phospholipid (PL)-enriched oils were recovered from six species of edible clams, namely Cyclina sinensis, Mactra chinensis Philippi, Mactra veneriformis Reeve, Meretrix meretrix, Ruditapes phliippinarum and Saxidomus purpurata, using a mixture of ethanol and hexane (1: 1, v/v). The oils contained a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (26.78-45.36% of total FAs), especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (8.17-10.48% of total FAs) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (7.83-21.34% of total FAs). The oils also contained a high percentage of PL (39.86-74.05% of total lipids). Among PL, phosphatidylcholine (37.40-52.19 mol%) and phosphatidylethanolamine (34.74-43.10 mol%) were dominant. At least 435, 442, 513, 438, 433 and 437 glycerophospholipid (GP) molecular species were characterized, respectively, in lipids from Cyclina sinensis, Mactra chinensis Philippi, Mactra veneriformis Reeve, Meretrix meretrix, Ruditapes phliippinarum and Saxidomus purpurata. Most of the predominant GP molecular species contained PUFA, mainly EPA and DHA, indicating that clam is a potential resource of PUFA enriched GP. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes and discusses the application of trimethylsilyl (TMS)-4,4'-desmethylsterols derivatives chromatographic fingerprints (obtained from an off-line HPLC-GC-FID system) for the quantification of extra virgin olive oil in commercial vinaigrettes, dressing salad and in-house reference materials (i-HRM) using two different Partial Least Square-Regression (PLS-R) multivariate quantification methods. Different data pre-processing strategies were carried out being the whole one: (i) internal normalization; (ii) sampling based on The Nyquist Theorem; (iii) internal correlation optimized shifting, icoshift; (iv) baseline correction (v) mean centering and (vi) selecting zones. The first model corresponds to a matrix of dimensions 'n x 911' variables and the second one to a matrix of dimensions 'n x 431' variables. It has to be highlighted that the proposed two PLS-R models allow the quantification of extra virgin olive oil in binary blends, foodstuffs, etc., when the provided percentage is greater than 25%.

AB Bovine serum albumin (BSA), whey protein isolate (WPI), insulin and a casein hydrolysate were entrapped in chitosan-polyphosphoric acid (PPA) beads. The in vitro release of protein from the beads in simulated gastric fluid (SGF, pH 3) and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF, pH 7) was evaluated. High entrapment efficiencies were achieved for intact proteins (>95% in all cases) but entrapment was lower for the casein hydrolysate (circa 50%), possibly indicating a physical or steric entrapment of the proteins in these chitosan-PPA beads. Inhibited release of BSA, in both SGF and SIF, was achieved with low PPA concentration. Insulin and WPI were effectively retained in SGF and gradually released in SIF. Peptides from casein hydrolysate were partially (circa 35%) but quickly released in SGF with no further release in SIF. Overall, these results indicate that chitosan-PPA beads show potential for lower gastrointestinal delivery of bioactive protein material. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A simple and effective method was developed for analyzing dinotefuran and its three metabolites (MNG, UF, and DN) in plum using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Due to the polarity and high water miscibility, dinotefuran and some of its metabolites (especially DN) have some limitations to be extracted with acetonitrile and salt following the "QuEChERS" sample preparation methodology. Alternatively, the samples were extracted with methanol, and purified with dispersive-solid phase extraction procedure (d-SPE) using primary secondary amine (PSA) and C-18 sorbents after filtration, and mass up. Due to the suppression effect originated from plum matrix, matrix-matched calibration curves, which provided good linearity with coefficient of determination (R-2) >= 0.998, were used for quantification of all analytes. Blank plum samples fortified with 2 spiking levels (10 x LOQ and 50 x LOQ) yielded satisfactory recoveries for all tested analytes in the range of 83.01 to 110.18% with relative standard deviation (RSD) <= 8.91. The method was successfully applied to field-incurred plum samples and dinotefuran and all metabolites were positively detected and quantified. In conclusion, we suggest that the method can be expanded to polar compounds having solvent and partitioning problems in any of the versions of QuEChERS. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study evaluated the effect of dietary vitamin E supplementation (1000 mg of DL-alpha-tocopheryl acetate/kg of basal diet) on physicochemical and fatty acid stability of fresh and thawed lamb leg chops, frozen stored for 3, 6 and 9 months. Legs were chopped, modified atmosphere packaged (70% O-2/30% CO2) and maintained under retail conditions (4 +/- 0.5 degrees C, with 14 h fluorescent light) for 9 days. Muscle alpha-tocopherol concentration was over 3.5-fold higher in supplemented samples than in control lambs. The effect of dietary vitamin E was independent of frozen storage, so these effects were analysed separately. Vitamin E supplementation reduced lipid oxidation (P <= 0.001) and decreased metmyoglobin formation, leading to a more attractive colour of meat. Moreover, supplementation led to a higher percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Therefore, vitamin E supplementation could be recommended for preserving either fresh or thawed lamb.

The addition of different concentrations of orthophosphate solution to the casein-iron precipitates resulted in gradual adsorption of the orthophosphate, causing re-dispersion of the casein-iron complexes. The interactions of added orthophosphate with iron in the presence and absence of caseins are postulated, and new mechanisms are proposed. The re-dispersed soluble complexes of casein-iron-orthophosphate generated using this process could be used as novel iron fortificants. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A nano packaging material containing nano Ag, nano TiO2, nano attapulgite and SiO2 was prepared, and its impact on quality of Nanjing 9108 rice at 37 degrees C and 85% relative humidity was studied. Effects of the packaging on ambient gases and chromatic aberration of rice were determined. Moreover, oxidation level, molds growth and flavor of rice were also analyzed. Results showed that nano packaging material had antimicrobial effects and maintained low O-2 and high CO2 content in the packages. The packages thereby inhibited the growth of molds and the production of fatty acids, restrained the increase of lipase activity, and reduced the oxidation of fats and proteins. As a result, the production of yellow and white-belly rice were inhibited. Furthermore, the color and flavor of rice were maintained. Therefore, the nanopacking material could be applied for preservation of rice to improve preservation quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to increasing number of food fraud incidents, there is an inherent need for the development and implementation of analytical platforms enabling detection and quantitation of adulteration. In this study a set of unique biomarkers of commonly found oregano adulterants became the targets in the development of a LC-MS/MS method which underwent a rigorous in-house validation. The method presented very high selectivity and specificity, excellent linearity (R-2 > 0.988) low decision limits and detection capabilities (< 2%), acceptable accuracy (intra-assay 92-113%, inter-assay 69-138%) and precision (CV < 20%). The method was compared with an established FTIR screening assay and revealed a good correlation of quali-and quantitative results (R-2 > 0.81). An assessment of 54 suspected adulterated oregano samples revealed that almost 90% of them contained at least one bulking agent, with a median level of adulteration of 50%. Such innovative methodologies need to be established as routine testing procedures to detect and ultimately deter food fraud. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To date the stable isotope ratios of berries have never been extensively explored. In this work the H, C, N and O isotopic ratios of 190 samples of different soft fruits (strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries and currants) produced in a northern Italian region and at two sites in Romania and Poland collected over three harvest years are presented and discussed.
   The different soft fruits showed a typical range for one or more isotopic parameters that can be used to verify the authenticity of the fruit composition declared on the label. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 of pulp and the delta O-18 of juice can be considered effective tools for identifying the different geographical origin of fruit. A significant effect of crop cover on juice delta O-18 and fertilisation practices on pulp delta N-15 was demonstrated and must be considered with attention when evaluating data.

AB The thermal processing of black garlic was simulated. Fresh garlic was incubated at 55 degrees C with 80% humidity and sampled every 5 or 10 days. The changes in relevant products were as follows: the fructan content was decreased by 84.79%, and the fructose content was increased by 508.11%. The contents of Maillard reaction intermediate products were first increased and then decreased. The colour of garlic gradually became dark and the pH decreased from 6.13 to 4.00. By analyzing these changes, the mechanism of black garlic formation and the changes on the Maillard reaction were revealed. The sweetness of black garlic resulted mainly from the fructose that was produced, and the black colour was largely due to the Maillard reaction between fructose/glucose and amino acids. An understanding of this process is useful to explain the formation mechanism of black garlic and could lead to better control of the quality of black garlic. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fresh red meat and cured meat consumption increases the risk of gastro-intestinal cancers and it is strongly suspected that nitrosylheme is implicated by stimulating the endogenous production of mutagenic aldehydes and N-nitroso compounds. To investigate the extent of endogenous heme iron nitrosylation an experimental in vitro model that mimics the physicochemical conditions of the gastro-intestinal tract was used in association with a mathematical model of chemical reaction kinetics. The combined effect of pH (from 7.2 to 3.2) and myoglobin oxidation state was evaluated in the reaction of nitrite with heme iron, and the observed rate constants of the reactions were determined. Nitrosylation was optimal under mildly acidic conditions (pH 6.5-4.7). Up to 20% of myoglobin can be nitrosylated under gastrointestinal conditions in this pH range. The effect of various antioxidants (from meat or vegetables) on the endogenous nitrosylation process was also tested. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study evaluated the inhibitory effects of Sichuan pepper (Zanthoxylum bungeanum) and sanshoamide extract on the formation of heterocyclic amines (HAs) in grilled beef patties. The following major HAs were detected and quantified: imidazopyridine (2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine, PhIP), imidazoquinoxalines (2-amino-3-methyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, IQx; 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, MeIOx; 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, 4,8-DiMeIQx) and b-carbolines (9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole, norharman; 1-methyl-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole, harman). The rates of PhIP, IQx, MeIQx and 4,8-DiMeIQx were inhibited significantly by 82%, 61%, 28% and 79%, respectively, in patties treated with a low-concentration of pepper (0.5%), and by 27%, 45%, 44% and 26%, respectively, following treatment with a low-concentration sanshoamide extract (0.005%). All inhibition rates exceeded 70% at pepper and sanshoamide extract concentrations of 1.0% and 0.010%, respectively. Harman and norharman could be significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced by the addition of all concentrations of Sichuan pepper, however, sanshoamide extract had no significant (p > 0.05) effect on them, although 0.005% of the extract could slightly increase the formation of them. Notably, significant correlations were observed between the HA inhibition rates and pepper or sanshoamide extract concentrations, especially for PhIP (r = 0.87, p = 2.30E - 3), IQx (r = 0.99, p = 5.04E - 7) and 4,8-DiMeIQx (r = 0.88, p = 1.96E - 3). These results indicate that Sichuan pepper and sanshoamide extract could inhibit the formation of carcinogenic HAs during thermal preparation of protein-rich foods, and therefore might reduce the risk of chronic diseases associated with the long-term intake of HA-containing food products.

AB A highly sensitive resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS) method for the determination of chitosan (CTS) was developed. In the pH 3.8 Britton-Robinson buffer solution, CTS interacted with erythrosine B (Ery B) to form an ion-association complex of [Ery B-CTS] which increased the RRS intensity of the system. With the addition of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), the RRS intensity was significantly enhanced, and the RRS intensity of the reagent blank(I-0) dramatically decreased. The enhanced RRS intensity (Delta I) was linearly proportional to the concentration of chitosan. Taking the medium molecular weight chitosan as the representative, the linear range of the method was 5.0-100.0 ng/mL and the detection limit (DL) was 0.47 ng/mL. The effect of the molecular weight of CTS on its accurate quantification was studied. Furthermore the dispersion and stability mechanism of PVA was discussed. Accordingly this assay was applied to detect the concentration of CTS in health products with satisfactory results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A closer monitoring of tropane alkaloids (TA) in foods is now recommended by the European Commission, following a series of alerts related to the contamination of buckwheat with weeds of the genus Datura. A novel, accurate UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the rapid detection of scopolamine and atropine in buckwheat foods. A suitable extraction protocol was set up to maximize recoveries and detection limits in different raw, processed and baked foods. The method offers good performances in terms of sensitivity, accuracy and precision, with LOQs at 0.04 and 0.10 mu g/kg. The established method is suitable for routine determination of trace levels of TA and was applied to 26 different buckwheat-derived organic foods, detecting TA in 3 samples (13.9-83.9 mu g/kg for atropine and 5.7-10.4 mu g/kg for scopolamine). Only in one case the level of contamination was relevant in terms of food safety. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to develop a bioreactor design for continuous milk coagulation using a biocatalyst composed of immobilized animal and vegetable rennet on aminated magnetic particles, which has been proven to be an appropriate carrier for enzyme immobilization. Calf and vegetable (Cynara cardunculus) rennets were covalently immobilized on CLEA (R) magnetic supports and the immobilization procedure was optimized in batch mode, by evaluating protein loading, caseinolytic activity and the coagulation properties of skim milk powder and cow's milk. Subsequently the optimal temperature of immobilized coagulant was defined and a technically-friendly enzyme bioreactor was developed in order to carry out a continuous milk coagulation process with the aim of producing soft cheese.

AB The potential effect of porcine plasma protein hydrolysates (PPPH) on the long-term retrogradation of corn starch (CS) was investigated. The differential scanning calorimetry results showed that PPPH significantly reduced the retrogradation enthalpies (Delta Hr) of CS (P < 0.05), obviously decreased the crystallization rate constant (k), and enhanced the Avrami exponent (n) (P < 0.05). Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance analysis demonstrated that the spin-spin relaxation time (T-2) remarkably increased with increasing PPPH concentration during storage at 4 degrees C for 28 days (P < 0.05). The X-ray diffraction results revealed that the relative crystallinity of retrograded CS decreased from 13.04% to 8.73% with the addition of PPPH. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis demonstrated that the addition of PPPH led to a decrease in hydrogen bonds within starch. The results demonstrated that the addition of PPPH apparently played a crucial role in retarding the long-term retrogradation of CS. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lipoaminoacids, as surfactants, are an excellent option for food industry due to the currently trends in consumption of functional and natural ingredients. Synthesis of lauroyl glycine lipoaminoacid was carried out with a lipase from Pseudomonas stutzeri and a protease from Bacillus subtilis, which were immobilized in octyl-glyoxyl silica and glyoxyl-silica supports, respectively, comparing their catalytic performance. The enzymatic selectivity towards the lipoaminoacid instead of the dipeptide glycylglycine and synthesis yield were evaluated with respect to the characteristics of the immobilized biocatalysts and synthesis conditions. Three solvents were tested as reaction media for evaluating the expressed activity, stability and catalytic behavior during synthesis. Results indicate that both enzymes favor the lauroyl glycine synthesis over the peptide synthesis, but the immobilized protease has the best balance between selectivity and yield: 40% yield for lauroyl glycine and less than 5% for dipeptide after 96 h of synthesis, at 45 degrees C and acetone as solvent.

AB The aim of this study was to discover the unique volatile compositional traits of retail milk from different production systems. Forty-four retail milk samples were analyzed, including organic milk (n = 10), conventional milk (n = 14) and pasture milk (n = 20) from winter (n = 22) and summer (n = 22). Proton transfer reaction quadrupole mass spectrometry (PTR-(Quad)MS) was utilized to obtain the mass-resolved fingerprints (76 masses per sample) of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Principal component analysis (PCA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed to evaluate the differences between the groups. The production systems were characterized by six masses, while season showed larger differences, with twenty-two masses discriminating between the milks. For 2 masses, a significant interaction of systems and seasons was observed. The chemical formula of these VOC masses were tentatively identified by Proton Transfer Reaction Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometric (PTR-(ToF)MS). These results illustrate that the type of feed is reflected in the VOC composition of milks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A rapid high-performance liquid chromatography method with a C18 reverse-phase fused-core column has been developed for the determination and quantification of the main capsaicinoids (nornordihydrocapsaicin, nordihydrocapsaicin, capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin, homocapsaicin and homodihydrocapsaicin) present in Naga Jolokia peppers. A fused-core Kinetex (TM) C18 column (50 x 2.1 mm i.d.; 2.6 mu m) was used for the analysis. The chromatographic separation was obtained with a gradient method in which the mobile phase was water (0.1% acetic acid) as solvent A and acetonitrile (0.1% acetic acid) as solvent B. The separation of all compounds was achieved in less than 3 min with a total analysis time (sample-to-sample) of 10 min. The robustness of the method was evaluated. The method showed excellent repeatability and intermediate precision expressed as coefficient of variance of less than 2%. The developed method was employed for the quantification of the major capsaicinoids present in different peppers and commercial products containing chilli peppers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB 3,5-Bis-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl isothiocyanate, was used as a convenient reagent for the derivatization of histamine, tyramine, tryptamine and 2-phenylethylamine, which eliminates the purification step. The obtained derivatives were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Additionally, the total amount of these amines was determined by F-19 nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. The procedures were optimized and validated for linearity, limit of detection and quantification, intra-and inter-day precision and recovery resulting in good reproducibility and accuracy. The reagent was applied for determination of the above mentioned biogenic amines in beverages, and permitted an undemanding separation and determination of the derivatives. Moreover, it is a convenient reagent for analysis of the total amine content by quantitative F-19 NMR. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Parsley leaves contain a high amount of bioactive components (especially lutein), therefore it is crucial to select the most appropriate pre-treatment and drying conditions, in order to obtain high quality of dried leaves, which was the aim of this study. The optimization was done using response surface methodology (RSM) for the following factors: microwave power (100, 200, 300 W), air temperature (20, 30, 40 degrees C) and pre-treatment variant (ultrasound, steaming and dipping as a control). Total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant activity, chlorophyll and lutein contents (using UPLC-PDA) were determined in dried leaves. The analysed responses were dependent on the applied drying parameters and the pre-treatment type. The possibility of ultrasound and steam treatment application was proven and the optimal processing conditions were selected. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This research investigated the influence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains on ester levels in Bordeaux red wines. These wines were made in five Bordeaux areas in two vintages, using three yeast strains. Malolactic fermentation (MLF) was carried out using industrial starters or indigenous strains, each in triplicate. Ester concentrations were determined by liquid-liquid-extraction-or HS-SPME-GC/MS at various stages in the winemaking process. The levels of most compounds were slightly impacted by LAB, depending on grape variety. Nevertheless, branched hydroxylated esters, such as ethyl 2-hydroxy-3-methylbutanoate and ethyl 2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoate were the only compounds to be strongly influenced by the bacteria strain, regardless of matrix composition or the yeasts used for alcoholic fermentation. Moreover, the effect observed after MLF persisted over time, for at least 12 months. These esters are apparently important markers of LAB esterase activity. To our knowledge, this was the first time they had been identified in this role. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study intends to demonstrate that acid titration at low pH is very well adapted to the monitoring of pepsin activity. After a description of the underlying principles, this approach was used during in vitro gastric digestions of a model of complex food containing 15 wt% of whey proteins, according to both static (2 h at pH = 3, Infogest protocol) and dynamic pH conditions (from pH 6.3 down to 2 in 1 h). Pepsin activity was quantitatively assessed in all experiments through the calculation of degrees of hydrolysis (DH). Final values of 3.7 and 3.0% were obtained in static and dynamic pH conditions, respectively, and validated using an independent method. Results also show that about 92% of the peptides were detected at pH = 3, and 100% for pH <= 2.5. Overall, the proposed approach proved to be very worthy to study protein hydrolysis during in vitro gastric digestions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, pullulanase was firstly immobilized by covalent bonding onto chitosan/Fe3O4 nanoparticles or encapsulation in sol-gel after bonding onto chitosan/Fe3O4 nanoparticles, and then the immobilized pullulanase was used for the effective production of resistant starch (RS). The highest RS content (35.1%) was obtained under the optimized condition of pH 4.4, enzyme concentration of 10 ASPU/g and hydrolysis time of 12 h when debranched by free pullulsanase, indicating that RS content was significantly (p < 0.05) increased when compared to native starch (4.3%) and autoclaved starch (12.5%). Under these conditions, the immobilized pullulanase (10 ASPU/g dry starch) yielded higher RS content compared to free enzyme (10 ASPU/g dry starch), especially, the pullulanse immobilized by sol-gel encapsulation yielded the highest RS content (43.4%). Moreover, compared to starches hydrolyzed by free pullulanase, starches hydrolyzed by immobilized pullulanase showed a different saccharide profile of starch hydrolysate, including a stronger peak C (MW = 5.0 x 10(3)), as well as exhibited an additional absorption peak around 140 degrees C. Reusability results demonstrated that pullulanase immobilized by sol-gel encapsulation had the advantages of producing higher RS content as well as better operational stability compared to pullulanase immobilized by cross-linking. The resulting enhanced RS content generated by the process described in this work could be used as an adjunct in food processing industries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The research reported in this article is based on the hypothesis that crosslinking of starch can make it a potential wall material for targeted delivery of probiotics by altering its digestion. Three probiotic strains namely Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus brevis and Lactobacillus plantarum were microencapsulated with resistant starch. Encapsulation yield (%) of resistant starch microspheres was in the range of 43.01-48.46. The average diameter of resistant starch microparticles was in the range of 45.53-49.29 mu m. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy of microcapsules showed peaks in the region of 900-1300 cm(-1) and 2918-2925 cm(-1) which corresponds to the presence of bacteria. Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) showed better thermal stability of resistant starch microcapsules. Microencapsulated probiotics survived well in simulated gastrointestinal conditions and adverse heat conditions. The viability of the microcapsulated lactobacilli also remained high (> 7 log cfu g(-1)) for 2 months at 4 degrees C. The results revealed that resistant starch is the potential new delivery carrier for oral administration of probiotics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was to provide understanding about the efficacy of decreasing dough hydration to slow down starch digestibility in white bread. Breads were made with 45 (low hydration bread, LHB), 60 (intermediate hydration bread, IHB) and 75% (high hydration bread, HHB) water (flour basis). A hydration depletion down to 45%, which is close to the minimum hydration found in commercially available white bread, did not prevent the starch in the crumb from complete gelatinization. However, LHB and IHB crumbs were more resistant to physical breakdown during in vitro digestion than HHB crumbs, resulting in a 96.81% increase of slowly digestible starch (SDS) from 75 to 45% dough hydration. The degree of gelatinization in crust samples was significantly reduced with a depletion in the dough hydration, ranging from 29.90 to 44.36%, which led to an increase of SDS from 7.41 in HHB to 13.78% in LHB (bread basis).

AB Rapeseed pomace (RSP) is a waste product obtained after edible oil production from Brassica napus. Analysis of ubiquitous secondary metabolites in RSP samples (two breeds, harvested in 2012/2014 respectively from North East of Scotland) and their ethanol/water (95: 5) Soxhlet extracts were carried out. Soxhlet extraction of the RSP (petroleum ether followed by 95% ethanol) gave a solid extract. LC-MS/MS data of the extracts revealed several secondary metabolites, with Sinapic acid being the most abundant. Strong antioxidant activities of the Soxhlet extracts were confirmed from the results obtained in the FRAP, DPPH and ORAC assays. Furthermore, for the very first time, RSP extracts (13.9 mu g/ml) provided complete DNA protection, from oxidative stress induced by AAPH (3.5 mM). Therefore the strong antioxidant and DNA protecting properties demonstrated by the RSP extracts in this study warrants further investigation for their revalorisation and potential use as reliable source of antioxidants in different food applications.

AB Stable viscoelastic masses have been formed from kafirin in a mainly aqueous system. Kafirin was dissolved in glacial acetic acid (GAA) and simple coacervation was performed by rapid addition of 15 degrees C water under low shear. Kafirin precipitated out as a network of hydrated fibrils which could be hand-kneaded into a viscoelastic mass. These could be formed from a very wide range of kafirins, including those where beta- or gamma-subclass expression was suppressed. Kafirin composition influenced the appearance of the masses but did not fundamentally affect stress-relaxation behaviour. Fresh kafirin masses exhibited similar elasticity and viscous flow balance to gluten. They maintained functionality when stored for several days at 10 degrees C but their elastic component increased. FTIR showed that when kafirin was dissolved in GAA its alpha-helical conformation increased substantially. Dissociation of the kafirin molecules in GAA, assuming a alpha-helical conformation may have enhanced water binding, enabling viscoelastic mass formation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The volatile profile of Spanish-style green table olives after fermentation and the changes in volatile compounds that occurred as a result of the post-fermentation and subsequent packing stage were explored by solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Three olive cultivars (Manzanilla, Gordal, and Hojiblanca) were processed and olive samples were taken at three different times throughout the elaboration: after fermentation, after post-fermentation, and after packing. A total of 132 volatile compounds were identified, including 10 phenols, 25 alcohols, 11 acids, 39 esters, 8 hydrocarbons, 14 carbonyl compounds, 17 terpenes, and 6 other compounds. A varying number of compounds from each chemical family underwent significant changes because of the post-fermentation and packing stages. Among them, some typical reaction products of lipid oxidation (e.g. (E)-2-decenal and (E, E)-2,4-decadienal) increased with the post-fermentation in Manzanilla cultivar, and also as a result of packing in all three cultivars.

AB The tyramine/glucose Maillard reaction was proposed as an emerging tool for tyramine reduction in a model system and two commercial soy sauce samples. The model system was composed of tyramine and glucose in buffer solutions with or without NaCl. The results showed that tyramine was reduced in the model system, and the reduction rate was affected by temperature, heating time, initial pH value, NaCl concentration, initial glucose concentration and initial tyramine concentration. Changes in fluorescence intensity and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra showed three stages of the Maillard reaction between tyramine and glucose. Cytotoxicity assay demonstrated that tyramine/glucose Maillard reaction products (MRPs) were significantly less toxic than that of tyramine (p < 0.05). Moreover, tyramine concentration in soy sauce samples was significantly reduced when heated with the addition of glucose (p < 0.05). Experimental results showed that the tyramine/glucose Maillard reaction is a promising method for tyramine reduction in foods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Brewer's spent grain (BSG) could be tested as an alternative source of polyphenols in animal nutrition. Proper extraction and analytical methods are critical for quantification. Thus, extraction for BSG, corn silage, and brans of rice, corn, and wheat were studied for the highest yield of polyphenols. A method for 18 phenolic monomers by HPLC-DAD was developed, validated, and applied to samples. An aqueous solution of NaOH (0.75% w/v) using integral samples for extraction resulted in the highest values for colorimetric measurements in all analyzed sources. Method by maceration showed the highest phenolic yield when applied in corn silage and BSG. However, for brans the best method was microwave assisted. Results from HPLC-DAD analysis clearly showed that native structures of phenolic compounds were simplified to its monomers allowing quantification and sample discrimination. BSG had the highest concentration of polyphenols and could be a promising and innovative source for animal feed studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB d-Limonene is a fragrant chemical that widely exists in aromatic products. Isotopic labelling of water molecules plus GC-MS and GC-PCI-Q-TOF analyses were used to investigate the influence of water molecules on chemical transformation of d-limonene induced by UV irradiation and air exposure. The results showed that the synergistic effect of UV irradiation, air exposure and water presence could facilitate d-limonene transformation into the limonene oxides: p-mentha-2,8-dienols, hydroperoxides, carveols, l-carvone and carvone oxide. UV irradiation, air exposure, or water alone, however, caused negligible d-limonene transformation. With the aid of isotopic labelling of water and oxygen molecules, it was found that water molecules were split into hydrogen radicals and hydroxyl radicals, and the hydrogen radicals, in particular, promoted the transformation reactions. This study has elucidated the mechanism and factors that influence the transformation of d-limonene, which will benefit industries involved in production and storage of d-limonene-containing products.

AB The four different methods of color measurement of wine proposed by Boulton, Giusti, Glories and Commission International de l'Eclairage (CIE) were applied to assess the statistical relationship between the phytochemical profile and chromatic characteristics of sulfur dioxide-free mulberry (Morus nigra) wine submitted to non-thermal maturation processes. The alteration in chromatic properties and phenolic composition of non-thermal aged mulberry wine were examined, aided by the used of Pearson correlation, cluster and principal component analysis. The results revealed a positive effect of non-thermal processes on phytochemical families of wines. From Pearson correlation analysis relationships between chromatic indexes and flavonols as well as anthocyanins were established. Cluster analysis highlighted similarities between Boulton and Giusti parameters, as well as Glories and CIE parameters in the assessment of chromatic properties of wines. Finally, principal component analysis was able to discriminate wines subjected to different maturation techniques on the basis of their chromatic and phenolics characteristics.

AB There is a growing need in the industrial sector (health, nutrition and cosmetic) to discover new biomolecules with various physico-chemical and bioactive properties. Various beneficial effects of peptides - notably those produced from protein hydrolysis - are reported in the literature. The antioxidant activity involves various mechanisms, among them metal chelation, studied by UV-visible spectrophotometry. In this paper, we set up an original method of screening metal chelating peptides in a hydrolysate using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) for their antioxidant properties. To date, the empirical approach used several cycles of hydrolysate fractionation and bioactivity evaluation until the isolation of the pure bioactive molecule and its identification. Besides, the detection of metal-chelating peptide is not sensitive enough by spectrophotometry. For the first time, metal chelating peptides were screened in hydrolysates using SPR and a correlation was established between affinity constant determined in SPR and metal chelation capacity determined from UV-visible spectrophotometry.

AB A novel antioxidant peptide YD1 (similar to 1.0 kDa), purified from the strain Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CBSYD1, displayed activity in several in vitro assays and was also efficient against Gram-positive, Gram-negative as well as multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. Strain growth was adapted to bile-salt conditions where a clear halos-zone was observed in a bile-salt plate assay and was viable in different digestive track conditions. YD1 treatment on RAW 264.7 cells increased the transcriptional and translational activities of NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf-2) through the enhanced levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Furthermore, the YD1-treated group showed higher levels of antioxidant enzymes compared to the oxidative stress group. YD1 demonstrated a strong antioxidant activity by decreasing nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in RAW 264.7 cells. This study suggests that YD1 and the strain could be a natural antioxidant and a probiotic candidate respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB H-1 HR-MAS NMR spectroscopy was used to track the metabolic changes throughout the whole development of astringent ('Giombo') and non-astringent ('Fuyu') cultivars of persimmon (Diospyros kaki). The NMR data revealed the low concentration of amino acids (threonine, alanine, citrulline and GABA) and organic acids (malic acid). In addition, the signals of carbohydrates (sucrose, glucose and fructose) seemed to play the most important role in the fruit development. In both cultivars, the growth was characterized by fluctuating sucrose concentration along with a constant increase in both glucose and fructose. In the initial growth stage, the polyphenol composition was quite different between the cultivars. Gallic acid was detected throughout the growth of 'Giombo', while for 'Fuyu', signals of polyphenols disappeared over time. Additional multivariate analysis suggested that these cultivars share many metabolic similarities during development. These findings might help the comprehension of fruit development, which in turn, impacts the quality of the fruits. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study confirmed the anti-fungal effect of trypsin-treated Bacillus subtilis culture (BC) (tryptic hydrolysate, TH) on mold growth on Kyoho grapes. We examined the anti-fungal activity of TH by identifying TH peptides and performing a computational docking analysis. TH was more potent than untreated BC in suppressing fungal growth on grapes. Specifically, TH maintained grape freshness by inhibiting respiration and rachis browning, maintaining firmness, and preventing weight loss. Thirty-six inhibitory peptides against beta-1,3-glucan synthase (GS) were screened from 126 TH peptides identified through proteomic analysis. Among them, 13 peptides bound tightly to GS active pockets with lower binding energies than that of GppNHp. The most potent peptides, LFEIDEELNEK and FATSDLNDLYR, were synthesized, and further experiments showed that these peptides had a highly suppressive effect on GS activity and Aspergillus niger and Penicillium chrysogenum growth. Our results confirm that tryptic treatment is effective for improving the anti-fungal activity of BC. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
