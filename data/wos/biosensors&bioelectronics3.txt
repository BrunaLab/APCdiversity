AB In this paper, we present the design, fabrication, and performance evaluation of a polyimide-based flexible neural probe for the precise site stimulation and recording in the deep brain. The probe consists of five electrodes: one for stimulation, another for ground and the other three for recording electrodes. This probe is designed to be foldable, enabling easy insertion into the deep brain via temporary tungsten guide sticks. Because of its small cross-sectional area and the flexibility of the polyimide, the probe causes minimum damage to the neural tissue and does not show any evidence of serious immune reactions such as high density of macrophage or microglia. Around the simulation electrodes, an additional ground electrode prevents the stimulation of the undesired sites in the brain. To ensure we stimulate the target point specifically, for instance STh in this study, we confirm through both finite element analyses and in vitro tests. With the additional ground electrodes, we observe the leakage power decreased by about 80%. To check the performance of the probe, we demonstrate animal experiments using rats, and neural spike signals from STh in the 7-mm deep brain are successfully recorded after implantation.

AB A robust and sensitive electrochemical assay for chrononocoulometric detection of nucleic acids at a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level has been developed. The assay exploits hybridization-induced conformational switching of gold-tethered TP53-specific 33-mer and truncated 20-mer hairpin DNA probes and methylene blue (MB) as an intercalating redox indicator. We show that by fine tuning of MB-DNA intercations the enhanced binding of MB to hybrids formed with a cancer-biomarker sequence can be achieved, and that results in robust "off-on" sensing of hybridization, while the stem-loop probe design allows minimized, independent of the DNA length background signals. Both DNA probes were sensitive to the presence of SNP in the targeted DNA sequence already at 10 pM. DNA levels, and the robust "off-on" discrimination of 10 pM perfectly matched DNA from 50 nM SNP-containing DNA was achieved by time-adjusted chronocoulometry. This label free hairpin DNA strategy allows systematic design of DNA assays for fast, robust and inexpensive genetic analysis in excessive mixtures of structurally-related DNA sequences and was used for specific analysis of prostate-cancer-realted cellular microRNA in total RNA samples isolated from LNCaP and BPH1 cells.

AB Bisphenol A (BPA) is an organic monomer used to make common consumer goods such as plastic containers, sports equipment, and cosmetics which are heavily produced worldwide. A growing interest has been drawn to general public as BPA is one of the major endocrine disrupting chemicals threating human health. To date, numerous BPA sensors have been attempted to be developed but important challenges still remained such as limited linearity range, easy to use, and long term response time. To address the present issues, a microfluidic channel should be integrated into an electrochemical aptasensor and it is called Geometrically Activated Surface Interaction (GASI) chip. The vigorous generation of the micro-vortex in the GASI fluidic chamber provides the high collision chances between BPA and anti-BPA aptamer (BPAPT) and consequently more BPA molecules can be captured on the aptasensor surface, which finally results in high sensitivity of the aptasensor. To construct the integrated aptasensor, a miniaturized gold electrode is fabricated using shadow mask and e-beam evaporation process. Afterward, BPAPT is immobilized on a nanostructured gold electrode via thiol chemistry, and other terminus of the aptamer is labeled with a ferrocene (Fc) redox probe. Then, the microfluidic channel is mounted over the miniaturized gold electrode to introduce and enrich BPA to the aptasensor. Upon the specific interaction between BPA and its aptamer, configuration of aptamer is changed so that Fc tag approaches to the electrode surface and direct oxidation signal of Fc and BPA are followed as analytical signals. The unique microfluidic integrated electrochemical aptasensor delivers a wide linear dynamic range over 5 x 10(-12) to 1 x 10(-9) M, with a limit of detection 2 x 10(-19) M. This aptasensor provides a precise platform for simple, selective and more importantly rapid detection of BPA. Such kind of sensing platforms can serve as a fertile ground for designing miniaturized portable sensors.

AB In this paper we present a comprehensive description of the design, fabrication and operation of an electrified Lab-on-a-Disc (eLoaD) system. The smart platform is developed to extend conventional Lab-on-a-Disc applications with an electronic interface, providing additional flow control and sensing capabilities to centrifugal microfluidics platforms. Wireless power is transferred from a Qi-compliant transmitter to the eLoaD platform during rotation. An Arduino-based microcontroller, a Bluetooth communication module, and an on-board SD card are integrated into the platform. This generalises the applicability of the eLoaD and its modules for performing a wide range of laboratory unit operations, procedures, or diagnostic assays, all controlled wirelessly during spinning. The lightweight platform is fully reusable and modular in design and construction. An interchangeable and non-disposable application disc is fitted with the necessary sensors and/or actuators for a specific assay or experiment to be performed. A particular advantage is the ability to continuously monitor and interact with LoaD experiments, overcoming the limitations of stroboscopy. We demonstrate the applicability of the platform for three sensing experiments involving optical, electrochemical, and temperature detection, and one actuation experiment involving controlled heating/cooling. The complete electronic designs and example programming codes are extensively documented in the supplementary material for easy adaptation.

AB A magnetic force assisted electrochemical aptamer-antibody sandwich assay (MESA) was developed for the detection of thrombin as a model protein in serum samples. The MESA using the formation of sandwich complexes on the electrochemical sensor probe for reaction and the removal of unbound bioconjugates from the sensor surface without washing are controlled by a magnetic field. Thrombin was determined by the cathodic currents of a toluidine blue O (TBO) attached with thrombin antibody modified magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) at the sensor surface. To detect thrombin in a serum sample, we applied a thrombin-specific aptamer as the capture molecule bound to the functionalized conducting polymer layer (poly-(2,2':5',5 ''-terthiophene-3'-p-benzoic acid) (pTBA)), and streptavidin and starch coated-MNP was conjugated with biotinylated thrombin antibodies (Ab) and TBO as the bioconjugate (MNP@Ab-TBO). The characterization of MNP@Ab-TBO and sensor probe was performed using voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy, XPS, and UV-VIS spectroscopy. The experimental conditions were optimized in terms of pH, binding time, removal time of unbound bioconjugates, and applied potential. The dynamic ranges of thrombin were from 1.0 to 500 nM with detection limit of 0.49 (+/- 0.06) nM. The recovery test demonstrates the reliability of the proposed sensing system for a handheld device.

AB In this study, a novel electrochemical aptasensor was developed for detection of AFM(1) aflatoxin M-1 (AFM(1)) based on the hairpin-shaped structure of AFM(1) aptamer (Apt), gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and complementary strand of the aptamer (CS). The conformational change of hairpin structure of Apt in the presence and absence of AFM(1) and also negatively charged AuNPs allowed detection of AFM(1) with high sensitivity and selectivity. In the absence of the AFM(1), the hairpin structure of the Apt was intact. So, a weak peak current was obtained. However, addition of AFM(1) could disassemble the hairpin structure of the Apt. Thus, the CS-modified AuNPs came to close proximity of the surface of electrode and a strong current signal was recorded upon the addition of methylene blue as redox agent. The aptasensor allowed determination of AFM(1) with a detection limit of 0.9 ng/L. Finally, the aptasensor was successfully applied for detection of AFM(1) in real samples, including milk and serum samples.

AB The ability to interact with plants, both to sense and to actuate, would open new opportunities for precision agriculture. These interactions can be achieved by using the plant as part of the sensing system. The present work demonstrates real-time monitoring of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) expression in transgenic tobacco plants using its activity as a biomarker for functional sensing. As "proof of concept", we demonstrated GUS enzyme biosensing under constitutive expression in Msk8 tomato cells and transgenic tobacco plants and in heat shock inducible BY2 tobacco cells and tobacco plants. The sensing was done using a three-electrode microchip in Msk8 or BY2 cell culture or in tobacco plant leaves. The electrode microchip was used to transduce the expression of the GUS enzyme by chronoamperometry to a measurable electrical current signal. For the constitutive expression of GUS in Msk8 cells, the system sensitivity was 0.076 mA/mM-cm(2) and the limit of detection was 0.1 mM. For the heat shock inducible BY2 cells the GUS enzyme activity was detected 12-26 h after the heat shock was applied (40 degrees C for 2 h) using two different substrates: p-nitrophenyl-beta-glucuronide (with sensitivity of 0.051 mA/mM-cm(2)) and phenolphthalein-beta-glucuronide (with sensitivity of 0.029 mA/mM-cm(2)).

AB Despite the availability of numerous electroanalytical methods for phosphate quantification, practical implementation in point-of-use sensing remains virtually nonexistent because of interferences from sample matrices or from atmospheric O-2. In this work, phosphate determination is achieved by the purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) catalyzed reaction of inosine and phosphate to produce hypoxanthine which is subsequently oxidized by xanthine oxidase (XOx), first to xanthine and then to uric acid. Both PNP and XOx are integrated in a redox active Os-complex modified polymer, which not only acts as supporting matrix for the bienzymatic system but also shuttles electrons from the hypoxanthine oxidation reaction to the electrode. The bienzymatic cascade in this second generation phosphate biosensor selectively delivers four electrons for each phosphate molecule present. We introduced an additional electrochemical process involving uric acid oxidation at the underlying electrode. This further enhances the anodic current (signal amplification) by two additional electrons per analyte molecule which mitigates the influence of electrochemical interferences from the sample matrix. Moreover, while the XOx catalyzed reaction is sensitive to O-2, the uric acid production and therefore the delivery of electrons through the subsequent electrochemical process are independent of the presence of O-2. Consequently, the electrochemical process counterbalances the O-2 interferences, especially at low phosphate concentrations. Importantly, the electrochemical uric acid oxidation specifically reports on phosphate concentration since it originates from the product of the bienzymatic reactions. These advantageous properties make this bioelectrochemical-electrochemical cascade particularly promising for point-of-use phosphate measurements.

AB An innovative electrochemical sensor assembly relying on a simple "green" electrochemical reduction route is presented for the sensitive detection of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), the most abundant oxidative product of DNA. The sensing film consisted of poly (L-arginine) and graphene wrapped Au nanoparticles was fabricated on glassy carbon electrode (GCE/P-Arg/ErGO-AuNPs) using subsequent 'layer-by-layer' regime through electrochemical technique. The proposed method was also successfully applied for the quantification of 8-OHdG in the presence of interfering biomolecules like ascorbic acid and uric acid. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was utilized to characterize the surface morphology of the composite electrode. Electrochemical characterizations of the bare and modified electrodes were carried out via cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). According to differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) results, there were linear relationships between the peak currents and the concentrations in the ranges of 1.0-100 nM (R-2 = 0.996), and 0.5-10 mu M (R-2 = 0.990), with a detection limit (S/N = 3) of 1.0 nM. Furthermore, the proposed sensor was successfully applied for the determination of target analyte in human urine samples and a very high recovery percentage was obtained.

AB The photoelectrochemical (PEC) technique has resulted in substantial progress in chemical sensing applications. However the complicated photoelectrode modification procedures would enable undesired background noise and decreasing sensitivity. Hence, it is important to explore a new approach alternative to inconvenient substrate modification. Herein, inspired by the stimuli-responsive drug delivery systems, an innovative PEC system is developed for efficiently microRNA-21 (miRNA-21) tracing. Hierarchical nanocomposites based on hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) coated self-ordered titanium dioxide nanorod arrays (TiO2 NRAs) exhibited enhanced response to solar light, promoted charge carrier separation and transfer efficiency was adopted as photoelectrode directly. Functional mesoporous silica nanomaterial (MSN) is prepared as nanocarriers for efficient loading of Cu2+, further capped with miRNA-21 responsive capture RNA probe. Thereafter, the capture RNA probe endows the functional MSN with responsiveness to miRNA-21. With the presence of miRNA-21, this system is thus triggered and a quickly release of capped Cu2+ occurs due to the dissociation of capture RNA probe presented on the MSN surface via base-pair hybridization. The released Cu2+ was then served as electron acceptor reduced to Cu degrees at the counter electrode to enhance electron-hole pair separation efficiency, leading to a promoted photocurrent response. Consequently, the miRNA-21 can be accurately quantified. Taking advantage of its sensitivity and specificity, this versatile strategy demonstrates a new route for the design PEC sensing approach without any photoelectrode modification procedure, and holds great potential for biosensing and clinical diagnosis.

AB Multiplexed electrochemical biosensors are intriguing due to their capability to permit high-throughput and lowcost assays. While commercial single-chip potentiostats are one promising approach for rapidly prototyping portable and low-cost electrochemical biosensors, it is still challenging to utilize them to achieve parallel multiplexing due to the limited resources integrated onto the chips. In this paper, we provide a methodology for incorporating multiplexing into commercial single-chip potentiostats by using a sequential architecture. In the sequential architecture, the multiplexed biosensors are interfaced to the single-chip potentiostat via single-pole single-throw switches, and the measurements alternate across the sensors. We build analytical and finite element models to investigate the behavior of the sensors, particularly when they are disconnected from the potentiostat, and find that we can take advantage of the dynamics of the sensors to achieve improved sensitivity over conventional chronoamperometry. We also investigate and compare different strategies to interface the multiplexed sensors to the single-chip potentiostat. Using the proposed multiplexing architecture, we demonstrate the implementation of 16-fold multiplexed amperometry, which is validated using ferricyanide measurement. Finally, the sequential multiplexing methodology is applied to a multiplexed bead-based electronic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of human interleukin-6.

AB Wearable-IOT based low-cost platforms can enable dynamic lifestyle monitoring through enabling promising and exciting opportunities for wellness and chronic-disease management in personalized environments. Diabetic and pre-diabetic populations can modulate their alcohol intake by tracking their glycemic content continuously to prevent health risks through these platforms. We demonstrate the first technological proof of a combinatorial biosensor for continuous, dynamic monitoring of alcohol and glucose in ultra-low volumes (1-5 mu L) of passive perspired sweat towards developing a wearable-IOT based platform. Non-invasive biosensing in sweat is achieved by a unique gold-zinc oxide (ZnO) thin film electrode stack fabricated on a flexible substrate suitable for wearable applications. The active ZnO sensing region is immobilized with enzyme complexes specific for the detection of alcohol and glucose through non-faradaic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and chronoamperometry (CA). Biomolecular interactions occurring at the electrode-sweat interface are represented by the impedance and capacitive current changes in response to charge modulations arising in the double layer. We also report the detection of alcohol concentrations of 0.01-100 mg/dl and glucose concentrations of 0.01-50 mg/dl present in synthetic sweat and perspired human sweat. The limit of detection obtained for alcohol and glucose was found to be 0.1 mg/dl in perspired human sweat. Cross-reactivity studies revealed that glucose and alcohol did not show any signal response to cross-reactive molecules. Furthermore, the stable temporal response of the combinatorial biosensor on continuous exposure to passive perspired human sweat spiked with alcohol and glucose over a 120-min duration was demonstrated.

AB Biosensor designing took a giant leap in its path of evolution after its merger with a wing of nanotechnology. Dramatic properties like high surface area to volume ratio, enhanced chemical and optical properties of nanoscale materials have revolutionized sensor technology in terms of their analytical performance. Many metallic nanoparticles (MeNPs) like gold, silver, platinum, palladium nanoparticles, etc. have been tremendously exploited for improving sensor performance. Over the years, there has been slow but steady shift in nanoscience research with an aim to explore composite MeNPs like bimetallic, trimetallic nanoparticles, etc. So far, these engineered nanoparticles are shown to possess multifunctional properties which are providing several advantages over monometallic nanoparticles (mono-NPs). As a result of these properties, composite MeNPs, particularly bimetallic nanoparticles (BNPs), have sought the attention of sensor engineers and since then there has been rapid rise in the number of reports of sensors incorporating BNPs within a brief period of time. Keeping this pivotal fact in consideration, we have complied this review to give readers a clear insight in the possible ways BNPs can be synthesized that would render them to possess crucial characteristics desired for bio/chemical sensor fabrication and their applications. We have also discussed different characterization techniques that have been applied to investigate various properties of the BNPs along with a table that gives information on how each technique is different and in what ways they complement each other. Moreover, a comprehensive report on the incorporation of different BNPs in sensor fabrication for detection of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), glucose, pesticides, nucleic acids, proteins, cancerous and bacterial cells has been described. The comparison of analytical performance of the biosensor design incorporating mono-NPs and BNPs, in terms of linear range (LR), limit of detection (LOD), sensitivity, and specificity, has also been discussed to show the importance of BNPs in sensing matrix.

AB The detection of specific nucleic acids is becoming increasingly important in the discovery of genetic diseases and clinical molecular diagnostics. Here we report a DNA nanostructure-based platform which enables a recyclable biointerface for ultra-sensitive detection of nucleic acid. We created a chemically cross-linked branched DNA nanostructure (CCLB-DNA) as the probe DNA to engineer the biointerfaces, thereby increasing probe distance, exposing more DNA probes from the interface into the solution phase, and thus enhancing the signal dramatically. In addition, DNA functionalized Fe3O4 nanoparticles were utilized for further signal amplification. The detection limit could go as low as 500 fM. Moreover, CCLB-DNA could endure denaturation conditions without disruption of duplex integrity; as a result, the recognition layer could be easily regenerated and the biointerface could be reused. Our CCLB-DNA represents an excellent prospect in the engineering of recyclable biointerface, which will be beneficial to many biosensing systems.

AB With the great advances in DNA nanotechnology, scientists have shown interest in developing dynamic nanostructures for theranostic applications, analyte sensing and cargo delivery. Here, we present a specific enzyme free ultrasensitive platform based on a multilayer coupled signal amplification strategy to quantify miR-21 molecule. The biosensor was integrated based on three signal amplification gadgets, namely a translator mediated catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA), a multilayer DNA concatemer on the surface of gold decorated magnetic nanoparticle (GMNP), and a DNAzyme-mediated catalytic signal amplification. MiR-21 mediates the release of a DNA translator from an immobilized duplex to engage in a CHA reaction using three hairpins, including a GMNP-conjugated hairpin 1 (H1), biotin-labeled hairpin 2 (H2) and a GMNP-conjugated hairpin 3 (H3) to form a three-way junction (3WJ). Meanwhile, a plenty of initiator strand 0 (S0) on GMNPs - each of which has been bifunctionalized with S0/Hi or S0/H3 - drive several multilayer peroxidase-mimicking DNAzyme concatemers in the presence of two accessory oligonucleotides; strand 1 (Si) and strand 2 (S2). Since a G-rich sequence was attached at the 5'-end of S1 strand, in the presence of hemin cofactor, an active G-quadruplex DNAzyme with peroxidase activity was formed. The concatemers on the surface of GMNPs can convert a colorless substrate to a green product. The biosensor can detect as low as 1 aM of miR-21 and provide an excellent capability to discriminate single-base mismatches. The required time for the formulation of the assay reagents is about three days and the reaction time for the detection of miR-21 takes place in less than four hours.

AB A novel photoelectrochemical (PEC) bioassay protocol for diethylstilbestrol (DES) was systematically proposed. The Au/UiO-66(NH2) hybrid with countless active sites was fabricated using an in situ reduction strategy and was subsequently decorated with CdS nanoparticles (NPs) by a sequential chemical bath deposition process. The resulting Au/UiO-66(NH2)/CdS composites were exploited as a sensing matrix for the first time. The excellent photocurrent response of the as-prepared hybrid under visible light is attributed to its improved photo-electric conversion efficiency due to the local surface plasma resonance (LSPR) effect of Au and the matching energy level structure between UiO-66(NH2) and CdS. In addition, the competitive strategy for the detection of DES was devised by employing the direct Z-scheme Melem/CdTe heterojunction covalently conjugated with bovine serum albumin (BSA)-DES as signal tags. As a consequence, a cascade-like band-edge level was obtained, which could effectively promote the transfer of photogenerated charges and markedly improve the photocurrent. On the basis of the above strategy, the concentrations of DES could be detected through the competitive binding of DES antibodies (Anti-DES) with either Melem/CdTe/BSA-DES or free DES. Under optimal conditions, the linear range for the detection of DES was 0.1 pg mL(-1) to 20 ng mL(-1). The detection limit was as low as 0.06 pg mL(-1) (S/N = 3). Furthermore, the designed PEC DES-sensing approach has acceptable selectivity, reproducibility, and stability and offers great promise for the detection of small molecules in biomedical, food and environmental samples.

AB Antimicrobial resistant pathogens are a growing worldwide threat to human health. This study describes a novel method for rapid and sensitive detection of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, specifically bla(CTX-M-15) which encodes for the enzyme that offers resistance to extended spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics. The method combines isothermal DNA amplification by recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), with microbead dielectrophoresis (DEP)-based DNA detection. The RPA amplicon is captured onto dielectric microbeads, and the amount of amplicon determined by dielectrophoretic impedance measurement (DEPIM) of the microbeads. Amplicon-labeled microbeads were prepared by either a two-step or one-step method. A purified recombinant plasmid containing bla(CTX-M-15) and genomic DNA (with plasmid) extracted from an AMR bacteria (Escherichia coli NCTC 13441) were used as target samples. A one-step method in which RPA and DNA immobilization on the microbeads is carried out simultaneously, has a detection limit of 2 copies/reaction for pure plasmid and 50 copies/reaction for genomic DNA. The assays are quantitative with a dynamic range up to 10(5) copies/reaction, with a total detection time of 26 min. Both methods are easy, rapid, and unlike lateral flow detection are quantitative.

AB In this work, a new "signal-on" split-type photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensing platform for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) detection was successfully constructed using p-type Cu-doped Zn0.3Cd0.7S as the photosensitive semiconductor material and target-triggered rolling circle amplification (RCA) for signal amplification. The signal derived from Cu-doped Zn0.3Cd0.7S was amplified by hemin/G-quadruplex. Upon target PSA introduction, the aptamer-primer probe (apt-pri) was captured by capture antibody-conjugated magnetic bead (MB-mAb) to form the sandwiched MB-mAb/PSA/apt-pri. The complex could initiate the RCA reaction to produce a long single-stranded DNA that provided binding sites for G-rich DNA and to form long single-stranded DNA/G-quadruplex/hemin. Upon the addition of exonuclease III (Exo III), the hemin/G-quadruplex immobilized on the RCA long product could be released by the digestion of Exo III. The hemin/G-quadruplex complexes in this study were used as efficient electron acceptors to neutralize the photoelectrons generated from the semiconductor and hindered the recombination of charges, thus enhancing the photocurrent. Under the optimum conditions, the developed sensing system displayed a good analytical performance with a linear range of 0.05-40 ng mL(-1) PSA and a detection limit of 16.3 pg mL(-1). Furthermore, good selectivity, high anti-interference ability, satisfactory reproducibility, and good accuracy were also achieved. These prominent analytical properties revealed that our strategy might be a potential and reliable tool for the detection of PSA.

AB We report an electrochemical sensor based on three-dimensional porous amorphous carbon (3DPAC) for the sensitive and selective determination of gallic acid (GA). The tailor-made carbon was prepared via salt-tern plating in which the organic molecular precursor, i.e., glucose, was simply ground and carbonized with a eutectic mixture of LiBr and KBr at 800 degrees C in an inert atmosphere. Salt removal from the carbon-salt mixture with water yielded 3DPAC with a hierarchical porous structure and oxygen-containing functional groups. When employed as an electrochemical sensor, 3DPAC exhibited remarkable sensitivity (0.1045 mu A pM(-1) cm(-2)) with a lower detection limit of 0.434 pM at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 and a linear response up to 1-150 pM for determination of GA. Under optimized test conditions, 3DPAC showed a superior peak current response for GA as compared to the glassy carbon electrode. In addition, ascorbic, uric, and caffeic acids did not interfere with the voltammetric detection of GA in terms of selectivity, stability, and repeatability. We envision that 3DPAC can provide a promising platform for the development of electrochemical sensors.

AB Paraquat (PQ) residue is harmful for peoples health. This work fabricated an efficient approach to determine PQ sensitively. We exploited a novel surface plasmon resonance (SPR) detection system based on the analyte induced network architecture of supermolecules modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on the chip surface. para-Sulfonatocalix[4]arene (pSC(4)) were used as a recognition molecule for paraquat. PQ can mediate the aggregation of pSC(4) capped AuNPs (pSC(4)-AuNPs) through the host-guest recognition, which can be used as signal amplification for PQ assay. This achievement is due to several outstanding properties of this detection system: first, local SPR and high refractive index of AuNPs can enhance the signal of SPR dramatically; second, AuNPs is more stable and biocompatible and diffusely used in colorimetric methods; third, the network AuNPs structure has unique photo characterization for enhancement of SPR. Analyte induced AuNPs aggregation amplified SPR assay shows dramatic signal enhancement ability. The detection limit for PQ was found to be 2.2 pM This strategy provides a new concept for developing sensitive SPR sensors for the highly selective detection of small molecules.

AB Numerous efforts have been made to measure tastes for various purposes. However, most taste information is still obtained by human sensory evaluation. It is difficult to quantify a degree of taste or establish taste standard. Although artificial taste sensors called electronic tongues utilizing synthetic materials such as polymers, semi-conductors, or lipid membranes have been developed, they have limited performance due to their low sensitivity and specificity. Recently, bioelectronic tongues fabricated by integrating human taste receptors and nanomaterial-based sensor platforms have been found to have high performance for measuring tastes with human-like taste perception. However, human umami taste receptor is heterodimeric class C GPCR composed of human taste receptor type 1 member 1 (T1R1) and member 3 (T1R3). Such complicated structure makes it difficult to fabricate bioelectronic tongue. The objective of this study was to develop a protein-based bioelectronic tongue for detecting and discriminating umami taste with human-like performance using umami ligand binding domain called venus flytrap (VFT) domain originating from T1R1 instead of using the whole heterodimeric complex of receptors. Such T1R1 VFT was produced from Escherichia coil (E. coli) with purification and refolding process. It was then immobilized onto graphene-based FET. This bioelectronic tongue for umami taste (BTUT) was able to detect monosodium L-glutamate (MSG) with high sensitivity (ca. 1 nM) and specificity in real-time. The intensity of umami taste was enhanced by inosine monophosphate (IMP) that is very similar to the human taste system. In addition, BTUT allowed efficient reusable property and storage stability. It maintained 90% of normalized signal intensity for five weeks. To develop bioelectronic tongue, this approach using the ligand binding domain of human taste receptor rather than the whole heterodimeric GPCRS has advantages in mass production, reusability, and stability. It also has great potential for various industrial applications such as food, beverage, and pharmaceutical fields.

AB A highly sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor is reported for glucose detection using self-assembled p-mercaptophenylboronic acid (PMBA) monolayer on Au coated optical fibers. The cis-diol group of saccharides, such as for glucose, interacted with the self-assembled PMBA monolayers on the optical fibers, but the low molecular mass of glucose is insufficient for measuring a significant shift in SPR wavelength. The response for glucose was thus enhanced with Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) modified with 2-aminoethanethiol (AET) and PMBA. Selectivity was assured since glucose has the ability to capture the signal amplification tags (Au NPs/AETPMBA) through secondary binding with another set of syn-periplanar diol groups and the PMBA on the gold surface. Accordingly, a glucose concentration-dependent sandwich structure was formed and the coupling between Au NPs and Au film results in the red shift of SPR resonance wavelength. The experimental results demonstrated that this SPR sensor responded to glucose within a range of 0.01-30 mM better than to fructose and galactose. The minimum concentration for quantify glucose is as low as 80 nM, which is lower than the physiological blood glucose level. Glucose was then accurately detected in urine sample, which indicated the potential application of the sensor for the analysis of glucose in urine. We believe that our proposed PMBA-modified single amplification tag and sensing principle can also be used for biomolecules consisting of carbohydrate structures, particularly for DNA-associated bioanalysis.

AB Heavy metal ions monitoring in water is practically significant for the environment and the human health. In this work, a lab-on-a-chip biosensor was developed for multiplexed quantitation of heavy metal ions by the integration of triple-channel volumetric bar-chart chip with DNA-nanoparticle probes. This method possesses the capability for rapid detection of Cu2+, Pb2+ and Hg2+ simultaneously with high sensitivity, selectivity and accuracy. Due to the highly catalase-like activity of the urchin-like platinum nanoparticles, this sensor exhibits high sensitivity with the detection limits of 1.0 nM, 1.0 nM and 1.8 nM for sensing of Cu2+, Pb2+ and Hg2+ respectively, which are much lower than the requirement of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in drink water and superior to the colorimetric method based on the metal ion-specific DNA assay. The accuracy and reliability were verified by our Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) and Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy (AFS) measurements of real water sample. As the results can be directly read out without the need of the external instruments or complicate data processing, this sensor is extremely practical for environmental applications.

AB A novel dual-mode cytosensor based on polyhedral AuPd alloy nanoparticles (PH-AuPd NPs) and three-dimentional reduced graphene oxide (3D-rGO) was constructed for highly sensitive detection of MCF-7 cells. The 3D-rGO was in situ synthesized on the paper working electrode (PWE) by a pollution-free hydrothermal method, increasing the specific surface area and further facilitating the modification of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs). After modified with AuNPs, the Au@ 3D-rGO/PWE was then functionalized by aptamer H1 to trap MCF-7 cells. To construct the cytosensor, PH-AuPd NPs was prepared as a novel catalytic material, and further modified with aptamer H2 for recognizing MCF-7 cells. With the occurrence of efficient recognition of MCF-7 cells, PH-AuPd NPs were bound onto the surface of the cells, and could catalyze H2O2 to generate center dot OH, leading to an amplified electrochemical signal. Meanwhile, as the electrolyte solution flowed, the center dot OH are transferred outward to the colorimetric detection zone, and catalyzed a chromogenic substrate TMB forms a colored product. The electrical signal measurement and colorimetric detection were carried out on a compatibly designed lab-on-paper device (LPD), realizing a dual-mode signal readout. This paper-based dual-mode cytosensor provided a relatively low detection limit of 20 cells mL(-1) and a sensitive detection from 50 cells mL(-1) to 10(7) cells mL(-1) for MCF-7 cells, providing a reliable pathway of sensitively detecting cancer cells in clinical applications.

AB A critical need exists to develop rapid, in situ, and real-time tools to monitor the impact of pollution discharge toxicity on aquatic ecosystems. The present paper deals with the development of a novel, simple-to-use, low-cost, portable, and user-friendly algal biosensor. In this study, a complete and autonomous portable fluorimeter was developed to assess the A-chlorophyll fluorescence of microalgae, inserted by capillarity into low-cost and disposable xurography-based microfluidic chips. Three microalgae populations were used to develop the biosensor: Chlorella vulgaris, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Biosensor feasibility and sensitivity parameters, such as algal concentration and light intensity, were optimized beforehand to calibrate the biosensor sensitivity with Diuron, a pesticide known to be very toxic for microalgae. Finally, the biosensor was employed in 10 aqueous urban polluted samples (7 urban wet-weather discharges and 3 wastewater) in order to prove its reliability, reproducibility, and performance in the detection of toxic discharges in the field.

AB DNA has well-defined ability to recognize a wide variety of targets, such as small biological molecules, proteins, inorganic ions and small organic molecules. As molecular recognition elements, DNA can be used to build simple, rapid and sensitive biosensors for detection of these targets. DNA-based SPR sensors are considered to be a real-time and label-free tool. We present a systematical and critical review on DNA-based SPR biosensors and their signal amplification via various strategies, focusing on recent advances in nanomaterials, novel DNA amplifications, redox reactions on surface, enzyme amplifications, as well as promising multiplex amplification strategies.

AB The present work reported a simple, lable-free and sensitive electrochemical method for the detection of protein kinase A (PKA) activity. This method was based on the specific recognition of aptamer and the aptamer-induced hybridization chain reaction (HCR) amplification strategy. The aptasensor was constructed by immobilizing capture probe on a gold electrode via an Au-S bond. When adenosine triphosphate (ATP) aptamer was introduced, its one terminus hybridized with capture probe and the other hybridized with the complementary region of an auxiliary probe, which other region triggered HCR between two hairpin DNA (H1 and H2) to form a long DNA concatamer. At last a large number of electroactive methyle blue (MB) molecules were assembled on the dsDNA concatamer, which generated a significantly amplified electrochemical signal. In the presence of ATP, the HCR would not be performed because the aptamer specifically bond to ATP and the electrochemical response would decrease. However, when ATP and PKA coexisted, the electrochemical response would recovery because that ATP had been translated into ADP by PICA. So the activity of PKA could be effectively monitored according to the change of electrochemical signal. Based on the HCR amplification strategy, the aptasensor showed a wide linear range (4 - 4 x 10(5) U L-1) and a low detection limit (1.5 U L-1) for the detection of PKA. Furthermore, the method was applied to study the inhibitory effect of H-89 on PKA activity. The developed aptasensor was also used to the analysis of drug-induced PKA activity in cell lysates, indicating the potential application of the developed method in the fields of clinical diagnostics and discovery of new targeted drugs.

AB The growing socio-economic burden of chronic skin wounds requires the development of new automated and non-invasive analytical systems capable of wirelessly monitoring wound status. This work describes the low-cost fabrication of single-use, omniphobic paper-based smart bandages (OPSBs) designed to monitor the status of open chronic wounds and to detect the formation of pressure ulcers. OPSBs are lightweight, flexible, breathable, easy to apply, and disposable by burning. A reusable wearable potentiostat was fabricated to interface with the OPSB simply by attaching it to the back of the bandage. The wearable potentiostat and the OPSB can be used to simultaneously quantify pH and uric acid levels at the wound site, and wirelessly report wound status to the user or medical personnel. Additionally, the wearable potentiostat and the OPSBs can be used to detect, in an in-vivo mouse model, the formation of pressure ulcers even before the pressure-induced tissue damage becomes visible, using impedance spectroscopy. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using inexpensive single-use OPSBs and a reusable, wearable potentiostat that can be easily sterilized and attached to a new OPSB during the dressing change, to provide long term wound progression data to guide treatment decisions.

AB The risks caused by veterinary drug residues in animal foodstuffs are of great concern to the public. Accordingly, this work reported an amperometric aptasensor for highly sensitive detection of sulfadimethoxine (SDM). Functionalised fullerene (C-60)-doped graphene (C-60-rGO) nanohybrid was designed and prepared to load electroactive toluidine blue (Tb) through the pi-pi stacking, forming a C-60-rGO-Tb nanocomposite. Furthermore, the as-prepared nanocomposite was decorated with gold nanoparticles and used for the immobilization of signal probes to form a new signal tracer, which was coupled with exonuclease-catalyzed target recycling for amplification. To construct the aptasensor, a thiolated double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) of aptamer-capture probe complex was immobilised on a gold electrode surface through strong Au-S bond. In the presence of SDM, the aptamer preferred to form an aptamer-SDM complex, which led to the dissociation of dsDNA. Then aptamer could be selectively digested by RecJ(f) exonuclease, resulting in liberated SDM molecules to participate in the next reaction cycling and achieve signal amplification. Then, capture probes released from the cyclic processes were hybridized with the signal tracer, which could further enhance electrochemical signal responses. On the basis of cascade signal amplification strategies, the proposed aptasensor exhibited a wide linear range from 10 fg/mL to 10 ng/mL for SDM with high sensitivity, good selectivity and satisfactory stability.

AB A novel kind of water-dispersible molecularly imprinted nanohybrids containing multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was prepared via the combination of co-assembly and photocrosslinking, and employed to construct an electrochemical sensor. A photo-crosslinkable amphiphilic copolymer (Poly(AA-co-VMc-co-EHA), PDHES) was firstly synthesized, which could co-assemble with MWCNTs in the presence of template molecule (paracetamol, PCM) in aqueous solution, generating photo-crosslinkable molecularly imprinted nanohybrids (MIP-MWCNTs). A robust MIP-MWCNTs film was formed on the electrode surface via the deposition of MIP-MWCNTs nanohybrids and the subsequent photo-crosslinking. After extracting paracetamol molecules, an electrochemical MIP-MWCNTs sensor was successfully developed. The as-prepared MIP-MWCNTs sensor showed a significantly wide linear detection range (0.1-2500 mu M) and low detection limit (0.02 mu M), owing to the large surface area of MIP-MWCNTs nanohybrids and superior electrical conductivity of MWCNTs, which affords a direct channel for the electron transfer from the recognition cavities to the electrode surface and thus enhances the response signal. In addition, good selectivity toward paracetamol (the imprinting factor alpha is 7.5) and ultrafast response time (less than 180 s) of MIP-MWCNTs sensor have also been demonstrated. The MIP-MWCNTs sensor also exhibited satisfactory repeatability and stability, which has been successfully utilized to measure paracetamol in urine samples with good results, demonstrating a promising feature for applications in medical diagnostics.

AB A new approach to enhance the electrochemical performance of biosensor was attempted by using Super P (c) carbon black/Star polymer composite material. In this study, we developed an electrochemical IL 8 biosensor by modification with a conductive composite including Super P, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and star polymer (SPGMA) of disposable ITO electrode surface. The Super P carbon black as carbonaceous material had a high conductivity and was used for the enhancement of electron transfer between electrode surface and electrolyte. Anti-IL 8 antibodies were utilized as biorecognition molecules and bound to epoxy groups of star polymer covalently. The chemical characterization of antibody immobilization on this composite was performed by using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy. The characterizations of stepwise modification of this immunosensor were performed by electrochemical techniques such as Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Single Frequency Impedance (SFI); and morphological techniques such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Several variables that affect the immunosensor performance were optimized. Under optimum conditions, a wide linear range 0.01-3 pg/mL and low detection limit 3.3 fg/mL were obtained. Super P-star polymer composite modified immunosensor was easy, sensitive, cheap and reliable analytical method for IL 8 detection. The applicability of the proposed immunosensor to determine IL 8 in saliva and serum samples were examined. The results of biosensor and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit were in compatible. Consequently, it was concluded that the electrochemical immunosensor offers a potential approach for IL 8 detection in clinical applications.

AB Here we report smart molecular logic circuits built on a well-designed H-shaped DNA nanostructure that can recognize cell-simulated bioenvironments and modulate the operations of a DNA nanosensor. By assembling a wild-type ATP aptamer and a parallel G-quadruplex into the H-shaped DNA scaffold, two intrinsic cellular components, ATP and K+, are utilized to activate the logic circuits, enabling fluorescent detection of the target DNA via toehold-mediated strand displacement. In this way, two logic circuits consisting of cascaded "AND-AND" and "OR-AND" gates are achieved, which are responsive to the ATP and/or K+ concentration change outside and inside cells, and therefore control whether or not the downstream DNA sensor works. This work illustrates a novel concept for developing new bioinspired DNA molecular devices for not only programmable molecular sensing but also targeted drug delivery.

AB The determination of ethanol intoxication in whole blood samples may open the opportunity for a precise and quick point-of-measurement in the ambit of medical emergency or law enforcement. In contrast with traditional techniques based on breath sampling, direct blood measurements present greater immunity to errors specially in case of unconscious or non-collaborative patients. In this context, a portable, sensitive and easy-to-use instrument is highly desirable.
   In the current work we present a smartphone-based mu Potentiostat which combines a novel circuital technique for sensor readout digitalization with a reusable lab-on-a-chip (LoC) concept. Such system allows both chronoamperometric and cyclic voltammetry measurements with a reduced number of electronic components on a very compact PCB (38.5 x 22.5 mm(2)). Power, data-link and user interface are provided in combination with a standard smartphone, enabling cost-effectiveness and reconfigurability without sacrificing precision. The readout platform discussed in this work has been coupled to a LoC for point-of-care combining Pt electrodes microfabricated on silicon substrate for electrochemical measurement and a microfluidic structure of methacrylate for fluid management. Biosensing is enabled by in situ electrodeposition of a calcium alginate hydrogel containing horseradish peroxidase (HPR) and alcohol oxidase (AOx) for selective ethanol detection. Alginate membrane electrodeposition has been here optimized for rapid generation (2 min) and to retain the cellular fraction, thus allowing the measurement in whole blood samples.
   The mu Potentiostat features a sensitivity of 36 nA/g L-1 to ethanol concentration in blood in the 0-1.25 g;L-1 range, with a limit of quantification (LoQ) of 4.5 nA, which is a suitable response for discerning the legal, illegal, severely illegal thresholds in a 40 mu L sample of blood.

AB The development of sensitive and simple approaches capable of monitoring trace amounts of protein biomarkers is appealing for disease diagnosis and treatment. Towards this end, we have developed an electrochemical sensing platform for sensitive and simple detection of protein biomarkers by using thrombin as the model target molecules via a target-programmed proximity binding amplification approach. The binding of thrombin to the aptamer sequences in the partial dsDNA duplex probes induces the release of the ssDNA trigger strands, which catalyze subsequent assembly formation of many methylene blue (MB)-tagged proximate DNA motifs with the presence of the DNA fuel strands through cascaded toehold-mediated strand displacement reactions. Due to the proximity-binding effect, these MB -tagged proximate DNA motifs anneal with the capture probes on the sensor surface with significantly enhanced stability against the corresponding single component counterpart, thereby pulling the MB tags close to the sensor surface and generating substantially amplified signal responses for sensitive determination of thrombin down to 23.6 pM. In addition, such aptasensor can specifically discriminate thrombin from other interference proteins, and can also be utilized to monitor thrombin in diluted serum samples, demonstrating its great potential for sensitive determination of proteins for early disease diagnosis.

AB This work describes the first electrochemical immunosensor reported for the determination of IL-13 receptor R alpha 2 (IL-13R alpha 2), an emerging relevant biomarker in metastatic colon cancer. The approach involves the formation of sandwich immunocomplexes using specific capture (CAb) and biotinylated detector antibodies (BDAb) further labeled with an streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Strep-HRP) polymer, onto carboxylic acid-modified magnetic microbeads (HOOC-MBs). Amperometric detection at disposable carbon screen-printed electrodes (SPCEs) using the (H2O2)/hydroquinone (HQ) system was employed to monitor the affinity reactions. The developed immunosensor exhibits a linear calibration plot over the 3.9-100 ng mL(-1) concentration range, a LOD of 1.2 ng mL(-1) and excellent selectivity against other non-target proteins. The amperometric immunosensor was applied successfully to quantify for the first time the IL-13R alpha 2 expression in raw lysates of colon cancer cells and to discriminate the metastatic potential of intact cells through recognition of this target extracellular receptor. In comparison with the commercial Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) kit involving the same immunoreagents, the immunosensor provides a similar LOD in a half-time for the assay.

AB Construction of hybrid systems that combine the cancer treatment and diagnosis agents on a single platform, known as theranostic systems, have received great attentions in the field of nanobiomedicine. Here, construction and characterization of a new multifunctional hybrid theranostic system based on RGO, PDA, BSA, DTPA-Mn(II), and MTX constituents, is presented. Accordingly, GO is partially reduced and simultaneously functionalized by dopamine, leading to reduced graphene oxide/polydopamine, RGO-PDA system; and then, the bovine serum albumin protein (BSA) is grafted onto this system. The obtained system, RGO-PDA-BSA, is further decorated with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-Mn(II) as diagnostic system and methotrexate as anticancer drug. Physicochemical characteristics of the RGO-PDA-BSA-DTPA-Mn(II)/MTX system are studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and electrochemical methods. The capturing ability of the prepared system for the cancer cells is evaluated through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and by using the 4T1 cancer cells in comparison with L929 normal cells. The EIS results indicate that a degree of selectivity as 6.23 for GC-RGO-PDA-BSA-DTPA-Mn(II)/MTX electrode system toward 4T1 cells, which is larger than that obtained for this system toward the L929 cells. Similar analysis performed using the GC-RGO-PDA-DTPA-Mn(II)/MTX system (having no BSA) indicate that the selectivity degree of the system is increased only by a factor of 1.6, implying that presence of BSA has increased the selectivity of the system for 4T1 cells by a factor of four. This behavior supports the crucial role of BSA in this process for 4T1 cells. Finally, the drug release study of RGO-PDA-BSA-DTPA-Mn(II)/MTX system is performed successfully at pH 7.4.

AB The slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) hampers the efficiency of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) to a large extent, which usually requires catalysts to facilitate the electron transfer. The major challenge of the existed non-precious metals in place of the noble metal catalysts (Pt, Pd, Au et al.) for ORR is their low efficiency, which urgently needs special route to tackle this issue. Herein, we report a simple and convenient technique using prussian blue analogues as precursor to directly synthesize the N-doped graphene encapsulated CoFe alloy which is present in "Core-Shell" structure via calcination of Co2Fe(CN)(6) in inert condition. The encapsulation of metal alloy within graphene shell immensely promotes the electron transfer from the encapsulated metals to the graphene surface. It efficiently optimizes the electronic structure of the as-synthesized catalyst and thereby triggers high ORR activity. The surrounding activated carbon (AC) contributes to the large pore structure and further offers a commodious route for the oxygen to gain electron. Therefore, the total resistance of air cathodes is significantly reduced from 17.300 Omega to 9.5515 Omega and the electrochemical activity is greatly improved. The power performances of MFCs indicate that CoFe/C-10% presents the highest maximum power density (MPD) of 1616 mW m(-2), which is 5 times larger than that of the bare AC. It is well concluded that the graphene encapsulated CoFe alloy can be recognized as potential ORR catalyst for MFCs.

AB We report a well-designed biointerface enabling the selective and quantitative detection of dopamine (DA) using a potentiometric biosensor. To enhance the detection selectivity of DA, a DA-templated molecularly imprinted polymer (DA-MIP) was synthesized on the extended Au gate electrode of a field-effect transistor (FET) biosensor. For a quantitative DA analysis, the thickness of the DA-MIP was controlled to ca. 60 nm by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). In this process, the DA-MIP was copolymerized with vinyl-phenylboronic acid (vinyl-PBA), inducing molecular charges at the biointerface of the FET gate electrode. These charges were generated by the diol-binding between PBA and dopamine (a catecholamine), and were directly detected as a change in surface potential. In fact, the surface potential at the gate of the DA-MIP-coated FET responded significantly to DA added at concentrations ranging from 40 nM to 20 mu M, whereas that of a non imprinted polymer (NIP)-coated FET hardly changed over this range. Moreover, by measuring the kinetic parameters and electrochemical properties of well-designed devices with various added catecholamines, we confirmed that the DA-MIP-coated FET biosensor selectively and quantitatively detects DA.

AB As a main cause of foodbome diseases, pathogenic bacteria have threatened the health and well-being of human communities. There is a need of fastness, accuracy and sensitivity in the method of detecting pathogenic bacteria. Classical signal amplification assays usually employ enzymes as biocatalysts to generate amplified signals, but the strict experimental conditions and complicated instruments restrict their application. In this work, we demonstrated an enzyme-free branched DNA (bDNA)-based signal amplification electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay for ultrasensitive detection of pathogenic bacteria. Firstly, the capture probes and the amplification probes group were carefully designed by our research group. The detecting ECL signal of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was amplified by bDNA technique through the layer-by-layer signal amplification. The sensitivity was greatly improved by the use of multiple Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) (TBR)-labeled ECL probes. Secondly, the whole process of the detection was carried out in the absence of enzyme, without the need to control the reaction conditions strictly. Thirdly, the designed amplification probes group could be used for the analysis of other pathogenic bacteria, virus, tumor markers, biomarkers, etc. For the detection of S. aureus, the limit of detection (LOD) of the method was 2 pM for standard DNA, with the linear range from 20 pM to 100 nM. Last but not least, the LOD of the S. aureus asymmetric PCR products was 5 pM, with the linear range from 10 pM to 50 nM. The sensitivity was 1-2 orders in magnitude higher than that of the common detection assays.

AB An ultrasensitive label-free amperometric immunosensor for the detection of chloramphenicol (CAP) residues in milk has been developed by using a screen-printed carbon electrode laminated with a layer of poly (vinyl alcohol -co-ethylene) (PVA-co-PE) nanofibrous membrane that is covalently immobilized with a CAP antibody (anti-CAP). The performance of the PVA-co-PE nanofiber membrane (PVA-co-PE NFM) on the electrode was compared with a PVA-co-PE casted membrane (PVA-co-PE CM), necessary fabrication steps and performance of the sensors were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The application of the PVA-co-PE NFM decreased the electron-transfer-resistance by about 4 times compared with a conventional PVA-co-PE casted membrane. Under the optimal conditions, the established immunosensor exhibited high sensitivity for determination of CAP in a range 0.01-10 ng in L-1, with a limit of detection of 0.0047 ng mL(-1). In addition to the good selectivity, reusability and stability over time, the prepared immunosensor was successfully used in the detection of CAP in milk samples without any pretreatment.

AB In this paper, a novel ultrasensitive signal-on electrochemical aptasensor has been proposed for Ochratoxin A (OTA) assay based on DNA controlled layer-by-layer assembly of dual gold nanoparticle (AuNP) conjugates. To construct the aptasensor, the 1st AuNP conjugate was prepared by simultaneous immobilization of the capture probe 2 (CP2) and bridge probe (BP) onto the AuNPs. Then, OTA aptamer was loaded onto 1st AuNPs by hybridization with CP2. The 1st AuNP conjugate can be further immobilized onto the electrode by hybridization between BP and capture probe 1 (CP1), which was pre-immobilized on Au electrode. The 2nd AuNP conjugate was prepared by immobilization of ferrocene (Fc) tagged SH-signal probe (SSP). Due to the recognition between aptamer on 1st AuNP conjugate and OTA, CP2 was reformed in the ssDNA state, which can be utilized as the anchor for immobilization of 2nd AuNP conjugate for electrochemical signal reporting. Because of the high surface-to-volume ratio and good conductivity of AuNPs, this dual AuNPs assembled nanoarchitecture finally lead to greatly improved abilities to load a large number of Fc molecules and significantly amply the electrochemical response even at a low target concentration. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis of OTA were thus realized by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) signals, resulting in an excellent detection limit of 0.001 ppb and a wide dynamic range from 0.001 to 500 ppb over 6 orders of magnitude. Moreover, the real sample analysis towards OTA spiked wine samples was favorable, implying a great potential for practical applications. We envision that this unique dual AuNP conjugate assembly strategy would pave a new avenue for the development of versatile signal amplified electrochemical aptasensors.

AB This work is the first report describing the solution grown 3D manganese oxide nanofibrous (MnO2 NFs) mesh and its potential for the simultaneous detection of biomolecules such as ascorbic acid and uric acid. The mesh is synthesized by a facile, one-pot, and cost-effective hydrothermal approach without using any template or structure directing compound. The morphology consists of randomly placed nanofibres possessing a diameter in the range of 10-25 nm, and length of several micron; constituting a highly porous and flexible material. The electrochemical potential was examined by recording cyclic voltammetry signals towards ascorbic acid and uric acid. The special mesh morphology offers a large surface area to promote enhanced electrochemical activity, and also provided a macroporous network that supported efficient mass transport. Additionally, the strong electronic cloud and roughness of MnO2 NFs mesh facilitated the fast oxidation of species at very low potential. The lower detection limit was found to be 1.33 mu M (S/N = 3) and 1.03 mu M (S/N = 3) for ascorbic acid and uric acid, respectively. The MnO2 NFs mesh modified electrodes can robustly differentiate both of them by giving well separate signals (Delta 6, = 500 mV) indicating capability of the material towards selective detection. The sensor has been successfully applied to human blood and urine samples and the recoveries were found statistically significant. These results demonstrate the practical feasibility of 3D mesh to develop sensors for the accurate diagnosis of clinically important molecules.

AB Direct extraction of photosynthetic electrons from the whole photosynthetic cells such as plant cells or algal cells can be highly efficient and sustainable compared to other approaches based on isolated photosynthetic apparatus such as photosystems I, II, and thylakoid membranes. However, insertion of nanoelectrodes (NEs) into individual cells are time-consuming and unsuitable for scale-up processes. We propose simple and efficient insertion of massively-populated NEs into cell films in which algal cells are densely packed in a monolayer. After stacking the cell film over an NE array, gentle pressing of the stack allows a large number of NEs to be inserted into the cells in the cell film. The NE array was fabricated by metal-assisted chemical etching (MAC-etching) followed by additional steps of wet oxidation and oxide etching. The cell film was prepared by mixing highly concentrated algal cells with alginate hydrogel. Photosynthetic currents of up to 106 nA/cm(2) was achieved without aid of mediators, and the photosynthetic function was maintained for 6 days after NE array insertion into algal cells.

AB Low electricity power output (EPT) is still the main bottleneck limited the industrial application of microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Herein, EPT enhancement by introducing an exogenous global regulator IrrE derived from Deinococcus radiodurans into electrochemically active bacteria (EAB) was explored using Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 as a model strain, achieving a power density 71% higher than that of the control strain. Moreover, IrrE-expressing strain exhibited a remarkable increase in the total amount of electron shuttles (majorly phenazines compounds) and a little decrease in internal resistance, which should underlie the enhancement in extracellular electron transfer (EET) efficiency and EPT. Strikingly, IrrE significantly affected substrate utilization profiling, improved cell growth characterization and cell tolerance to various stresses. Further quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that IrrE led to many differentially expressed genes, which were responsible for phenazines core biosynthesis, biofilm formation, QS systems, transcriptional regulation, glucose metabolism and general stress response. The results substantiated that targeting cellular regulatory network by the introduction of exogenous global regulators could be a facile and promising approach for the enhancement of bioelectricity generation and cell multiple phenotypes, and thus would be of great potential application in the practical MFCs.

AB An interferometric nanobiosensor for the specific and label-free detection of the pollutant Irgarol 1051 directly in seawater has been settled. Due to the low molecular weight of Irgarol pollutant and its expected low concentration in seawater, the sensor is based on a competitive inhibition immunoassay. Parameters as surface biofunctionalization, concentration of the selective antibody and regeneration conditions have been carefully evaluated. The optimized immunosensor shows a limit of detection of only 3 ng/L, well below the 16 ng/L set by the EU as the maximum allowable concentration in seawater. It can properly operate during 30 assay-regeneration cycles using the same sensor biosurface and with a time-to-result of only 20 min for each cycle. Moreover, the interferometric nanosensor is able to directly detect low concentrations of Irgarol 1051 in seawater without requiring sample pre-treatments and without showing any background signal due to sea matrix effect.

AB Simultaneous and point-of-care detection of multiple protein biomarkers has significant impact on patient care. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) are well known progressive hereditary disorders associated with increased morbidity as well as mortality. Therefore, rapid detection of biomarkers specific for these three disorders in newborns offers new opportunities for early diagnosis, delaying symptoms and effective treatment. Here, we report the development of a disposable carbon nanofiber (CNF)-based electrochemical immunosensor for simultaneous detection of survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and DMD proteins. The CNF-modified array electrodes were first functionalized by electroreduction of carboxyphenyl diazonium salt. Then, the immunosensor was fabricated by the covalent immobilization of the three antibodies on the working electrodes of the array sensor via carbodiimide (EDC/NHS) chemistry. Simultaneous detection of CFTR, DMD and SMN1 was achieved with high sensitivity and detection limits of 0.9 pg/ml, 0.7 pg/ml and 0.74 pg/ml, respectively. The multiplexed immunosensor has also shown strong selectivity against non-specific proteins. Moreover, high recovery percentage was obtained when the immunosensor was applied in spiked whole blood samples. This voltammetric immunosensor offers cost effective, easy to use, rapid and high throughput potential screening method for these three hereditary disorders using only few drops of blood.

AB Protein expression level is critically related to the cell physiological function. However, current methodologies such as Western blot (WB) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) in analyzing the protein level are rather semi quantitative and without the information of actual protein concentration. We have developed a microfluidic technique termed a "flow-proteometric platform for analyzing protein concentration (FAP)" that can measure the concentration of a target protein in cells or tissues without the requirement of a calibration standard, e.g., the purified target molecules. To validate our method, we tested a number of control samples with known target protein concentrations and showed that the FAP measurement resulted in concentrations that well matched the actual concentrations in the control samples (coefficient of determination [R-2], 0.998), demonstrating a dynamic range of concentrations from 0.13 to 130 pM of a detection for 2 min. We successfully determined a biomarker protein (for predicting the treatment response of cancer immune check-point therapy) PD-L1 concentration in cancer cell lines (HeLa PD-L1 and MDA-MB-231) and breast cancer patient tumor tissues without any prior process of sample purification and standard line construction. Therefore, FAP is a simple, faster, and reliable method to measure the protein concentration in cells and tissues, which can support the conventional methods such as WB and IHC to determine the actual protein level.

AB Here we report an electrochemical immunoassay platform called Proton-ELISA (H-ELISA) for the detection of bioanalytes. H-ELISA uniquely utilizes protons as an immunoassay detection medium, generated by the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) coupled with Fenton's reagent in a proton amplification reaction cascade that results in a highly amplified signal. A proton-sensitive dual-gated ion-sensitive field effect transistor (DG-ISFET) sensor was also developed for sensitive and accurate detection of the proton signal in H-ELISA. The DG-ISFET sensor comprises of a 128 x 128 array of 16,384 sensing transistors each with an individually addressable back gate to allow for a very high signal throughput and improved accuracy. We then demonstrated that the platform could detect C-reactive protein and immunoglobulin E down to concentrations of 12.5 and 125 pg/mL, respectively. We further showed that the platform is compatible with complex biological sample conditions such as human serum, suggesting that the platform is sufficiently robust for potential diagnostic applications.

AB This paper reports the comparative analysis, by means of electric impedance spectroscopy measurements, of three different cell lines subjected to electroporative pulses. The multifrequency information is recorded simultaneously at 21 frequency values in the range between 5 kHz and 1.3 MHz using a multisine based measuring approach. The analysis of the pre-electroporation impedance spectra shows how the system is able to detect differences and similarities between the cell lines under analysis. Particularly, a good agreement is found between the average cell diameter and the characteristic frequency (the frequency corresponding to a maximum in the imaginary part of the impedance). The measurements performed during electroporation at three different electric field intensities show how the impedance spectra changes dynamically between the consecutive pulses of a train of 8,100 mu s pulses delivered at 1 Hz repetition rate. There are clear differences between the changes in the impedance measured at low and high frequency. The multifrequency information has been fitted to an electrical equivalent model in order to understand the different contributions in the observed impedance changes (mainly separate between membrane permeabilization and the conductivity changes in the extracellular medium). Finally, a ratio of the low and high frequency impedance information is used to estimate the accumulated impedance decay and to compare it to the internalization of a fluorescent permeabilization reporter. The comparison between both techniques at the three electroporation electric field intensities assayed confirms the ability of impedance measurements to detect in a precise way the level of membrane permeabilization. Additionally, this study demonstrates how the real time information obtained thanks to impedance measurements can provide a more precise quantification of the membrane permeabilization extent.

AB Tuberculosis is a major global health problem caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) complex. According to WHO reports, 53 million TB patients died from 2000 to 2016. Therefore, early diagnosis of the disease is of great importance for global health care programs. The restrictions of traditional methods have encouraged the development of innovative methods for rapid, reliable, and cost-effective diagnosis of tuberculosis. In recent years, aptamer-based biosensors or aptasensors have drawn great attention to sensitive and accessible detection of tuberculosis. Aptamers are small short single-stranded molecules of DNA or RNA that fold to a unique form and bind to targets. Once combined with nanomaterials, nano-scale aptasensors provide powerful analytical platforms for diagnosing of tuberculosis. Various groups designed and studied aptamers specific for the whole cells of M. tuberculosis, mycobacterial proteins and IFN-gamma for early diagnosis of TB. Advantages such as high specificity and strong affinity, potential for binding to a larger variety of targets, increased stability, lower costs of synthesis and storage requirements, and lower probability of contamination make aptasensors pivotal alternatives for future TB diagnostics. In recent years, the concept of SOMAmer has opened new horizons in high precision detection of tuberculosis biomarkers. This review article provides a description of the research progresses of aptamer-based and SOMAmer-based biosensors and nanobiosensors for the detection of tuberculosis.

AB In-tissue embedded magnetic nanoparticle (MNPs) detection is one of the most interesting cases for cancer research. In order to understand the origin, the limits and the way of improvement of magnetic biosensor sensitivity for the detection of 3D mezoscopic distributions of MNPs, we have developed a magnetoimpedance biosensor prototype with a [Cu (3 nm)/FeNi(100 nm)](5)/Cu(500 nm)/[FeNi(100 nm)/Cu(3 nm)](5) rectangular sensitive element. Magnetoimpedance (MI) responses were measured with and without polyacrylamide ferrogel layer mimicking natural tissue in order to evaluate stray fields of embedded MNPs of gamma-Fe2O3 iron oxide. A model for MI response based on a solution of Maxwell equations with Landau-Lifshitz equation was developed in order to understand the origin of the prototype sensitivity which reached 1.3% of Delta Z/Z per 1% of MNPs concentration by weight. To make this promising technique useful for magnetically labeled tissue detection, a synthesis of composite gels with MNPs agglomerates compactly located inside pure gel and their MI testing are still necessary.

AB Metamaterials (MM)-inspired microwave biosensors are a valuable addition to the field of diagnostic approaches and prognostic tools. The fundamental principle behind these biosensors is unique dielectric signatures corresponding to healthy/diseased tissues. Relying on nonionizing radiation and offering an increased resolution with accuracy comparable to that of ultrasound devices, they are an attractive solution for noninvasive and label-free biosensing applications. High-quality-factor MM-inspired resonators are integrated with microfluidics to accelerate the lab-on-chip and point-of-care diagnostic approaches owing to the small detection volume and overall compact size of these devices. A variety of biomolecular detection, glucose detection and hyperthermia treatment using state-of-the-art MM-inspired biosensors have been discussed. Optical transduction techniques (e.g., surface plasmon resonance) which enhance the sensitivity in terms of limit-of-detection and resolution, have also been outlined. Utilization of microwave biosensors as therapeutic agents is at its initial stages owing to lack of required sensitivity and reliability in recently proposed MM-inspired biosensors.

AB The accurate detection of the superoxide anion (O-2(center dot-)) has vital academic and medical diagnostic significance due to its important dual roles in biological functioning. In this work, hollow porous PtAg nanospheres (PtAg HPNSs) were fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method followed by a dealloying procedure. The as-made PtAg nanospheres possessed hollow interiors and porous shells composed of interconnected ligaments and pores with the typical size around 4 nm. Benefitting from the unique hollow nanoporous architecture and the specific alloying effect, the PtAg HPNSs showed high electrocatalytic activity towards superoxide anions. The constructed biosensor based on PtAg HPNSs presented a fast and ultrasensitive response in a wide range of 0.8-1080 nM with much higher sensitivity of 4.5 x 10(-2) mu A cm(-2) nM(-1) and low detection limit of 0.2 nM (S/N = 3). Moreover, the novel biosensors can achieve electrochemical detection for O-2(center dot-) released from living cells, exhibiting outstanding real time detection capability in cell environment. The facile controllable fabrication and unique sensing performance for PtAg HPNSs offers potential practical applications in developing highly sensitive and stable biosensor towards superoxide anion.

AB Mercury and its compounds are emitted during industrial processes and are extremely harmful for eco systems and human health. Therefore, the detection of mercury ions (Hg2+) in our living and working environment is of great importance for the society and especially for the health of human beings. Here we demonstrate a proof of concept nanoparticle stripe sensor for highly sensitive and selective detection of Hg2+. This sensor is based on the changes of the charge transport between the neighboring nanoparticles in the nanoparticle stripe. The addition of Hg2+ induces a chelation between Hg2+ and carboxylic groups on the surface modification molecules and thus facilitates the charge transport, causing an increase of conductivity in the nanoparticle stripe. These nanoparticle stripes with a few layers in height and several micrometers in width possess large surface area, which increases their exposure to ions and improves the ability to detect Hg2+ at low concentrations. Besides, we studied the effect of molecular length on the sensitivity of the sensor. It is shown that the length of surface modification molecules is positively correlated with the sensitivity of the sensor. The fabricated devices exhibit a detection limit as low as 0.1 nM and a specific response towards Hg2+ ions.

AB A sensitive and homogeneous electrochemical aptasensor was fabricated for the detection of mucin 1 (MUC1) by combining a well-designed DNA bulge-loop (L-DNA) structure with high-efficient exonuclease I (Exo I)-assisted target recycling amplification strategy. The L-DNA probe was constructed via the hybridization of the MUC1 aptamer and methylene blue (MB) labeled complementary DNA (cDNA) (cDNA-MB) and hence could not diffuse freely to the negatively charged ITO electrode surface due to the strong electrostatic repulsion, so small electrochemical signal was detected. The addition of MUC1 caused the dissociation of L-DNA structure due to the specificity between aptamer and MUC1. Then Exo I was implemented to digest the released cDNA-MB into mononucleotides and then produced short MB-labeled mononucleotides fragments (MB-MFs). As the MB-MFs contained few negative charges, it diffused easily to the negatively charged ITO electrode surface and resulted in the enhanced electrochemical signal. Meanwhile, the MUC1-aptamer complex was also specifically digested by Exo I, resulting in the liberation of MUC1 and hence realized the target recycling and then caused the amplification of the electrochemical signal. The enhanced electrochemical signal has a good linear relationship with logarithm of MUC1 concentration in the range of 1.0 pg mL(-1)-50 ng mL(-1) with a limit of detection of 0.40 pg mL(-1) (S/N = 3). Additionally, the fabricated aptasensor has been successfully applied to detect MUC1 in serum samples with satisfactory results and thereby it exhibits great potential in the practical application of clinical diagnosis.

AB The integration of plasmonic nanoparticles into biosensors has the potential to increase the sensitivity and dynamic range of detection, through the use of single nanoparticle assays. The analysis of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of plasmonic nanoparticles has allowed the limit of detection of biosensors to move towards single molecules. However, due to complex equipment or slow analysis times, these technologies have not been implemented for point-of-care detection. Herein, we demonstrate an advancement in LSPR analysis by presenting a technique, which utilizes an inexpensive CMOS-equipped digital camera and a dark-field microscope, that can analyse the 2k.ma, of over several thousand gold nanospheres in less than a second, without the use of a spectrometer. This improves the throughput of single particle spectral analysis by enabling more nano particles to be probed and in a much shorter time. This technique has been demonstrated through the detection of interleukin-6 through a core-satellite binding assay. We anticipate that this technique will aid in the development of high-throughput, multiplexed and point-of-care single nanoparticle biosensors.

AB Multiplexed biosensors hold great promise for early diagnosis of diseases where the detection of multiple biomarkers is required. Hyper Immunoglobulin E syndromes (HIES) are rare primary immunodeficiency disorders associated with mutations either in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), dedicator of cytokinesis 8 DOCK8) or phosphoglucomutase 3 (PGM3) genes. Yet, the diagnosis of HIES is challenged by the complexity of the existing laboratory assays. Here, we report for the first time the development of a multiplexed electrochemical immunosensor for the simultaneous detection of DOCK8, STAT3 and PGM3 proteins. The immunosensor was constructed on carbon array electrodes that were first modified by electrodeposition of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The array electrodes were then used to immobilize specific antibodies for the three proteins after the functionalization of the electrodes with cysteamine/glutaraldehyde linkers. The simultaneous detection of the DOCK8, PGM3 and STAT3 proteins was successfully realized by the immunosensor with respective limits of detections of 3.1, 2.2 and 3.5 pg/ml. The immunosensor has shown good sensitivity as well as selectivity against other proteins such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Moreover, the immunosensor was successfully applied in human serum samples showing capability to distinguish the HIES from the control samples.

AB A novel fluidic-based electrochemical ELISA platform is descried for estimation of the bladder cancer protein markers nuclear mitotic apparatus protein 1 (NUMA1) and complement factor H-related 1 (CFHR1). The platform uses an off-site chamber for a sandwich immunoassay and performs the electrochemistry on-chip in a separate chamber. The off-site matrices were connected to the sensor chip in a manner that the sensors were exposed only to the final electroactive product for signal detection, thus avoiding interference from other molecules present in the sample. Two off-site matrices using 3D polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) sheets and 2D polycarbonate (PC) membranes modified with the desired antibodies were investigated. Antibodies for NUMA1 and CFHR1 were utilized for the immunoassay and hair comb structured gold electrodes were used for sensing. Results in 10% synthetic urine reveal that the system can detect NUMA1 and CFHR1 in the 1-100 ng/ml range with high sensitivities of 260 nA/(ng/ml) and 310 nA/(ng/ml), for NUMA1 and CFHR1, respectively; negligible interference from the diluted urine and other molecules has been observed. A fully automated fluidic prototype has also been developed to demonstrate that automation of the process and multiplexing of detection can be achieved in a small footprint benchtop device. The use of off-site matrix-based platforms paves the way towards a new generation of electrochemical immunosensors for biomarker estimation with negligible non-specific interactions and false signals in complex samples.

AB We demonstrate the fabrication of fully printed microfluidic CD4 counting chips with complete on-chip sample preparation and their applicability as a CD4 counting assay using samples from healthy donors and HIV-infected patients. CD4 counting in low-income and resource-limited point-of-care settings is only practical and affordable, if disposable tests can be fabricated at very low cost and all manual sample preparation is avoided, while operation as well as quantification is fully automated and independent of the skills of the operator. Here, we show the successful use of (inkjet) printing methods both to fabricate microfluidic cell counting chambers with controlled heights, and to deposit hydrogel layers with embedded fluorophore-labeled antibodies for on-chip sample preparation and reagent storage. The maturation process of gelatin after deposition prevents antibody wash-off during blood inflow very well, while temperature-controlled dissolution of the matrix ensures complete antibody release for immunostaining after the inflow has stopped. The prevention of antibody wash-off together with the subsequent complete antibody release guarantees a homogeneous fluorescence background, making rapid and accurate CD4 counting possible.
   We show the successful application of our fully printed CD4 counting chips on samples from healthy donors as well as from HIV-infected patients and find an excellent agreement between results from our method and from the gold standard, flow cytometry, in both cases.

AB Treatment for cancer depends on the type of cancer, and the stage or its development, and thus the need for point-of-care technology that can allow rapid and precise detection of biomarkers is increasing. Here, we present a simple on chip electrical detection of Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). We rely on using a novel peptide modified plastic-paper microfluidic chips to perform efficient and specific impedimetric detection of AFP in human serum. The chips are prepared from a lower sheet of plastic and upper layer of cellulose chromatography paper modified with silver-20 wto/o graphene printed electrodes. Diphenylalanine (FF) was proposed to involve in detection zone of the fabricated microchips in order to improve the sensing performance and the stability of immobilized antibodies according to amine-aldehyde reaction. The target protein is captured on the surface of microchips using specific monoclonal antibodies and the electrical response of the chip is monitored in the presence and absence of different concentrations of AFP. The influence of several parameters including the material types for screen printing of electrodes, FF concentrations, solvent and pH of FF solution on electrical response and cellulose fibers morphology was explored. The impedance measurements of AFP on the fabricated microchip in the optimized parameters exhibited a detection limit of 1 and 10 ng ml(-1) in PBS and plasma, respectively. This platform developed here can be adopted to develop systems for rapid detection of biomarkers using portable electric devices.

AB Using one-step anodization strategy, a nanoporous gold film (HNPG) with large surface area was rapidly fabricated on Au80Sn20 (wt%) alloy in just 80 s. The formation of highly surface-roughened nanoporous structures results from a complex process of electrochemical dealloying of Sn component from AuSn alloy, anodic electrodissolution, disproportion and deposition of Au component, and spontaneous redox reaction between electrodissolved Sn2+ and AuCl4- species at the applied anodic potential. As-prepared HNPG/AuSn shows enhanced electrochemical performance for glucose oxidation in alkaline electrolyte. At a low potential of 0.1 V (vs. SCE), it offers a short response time of 4 s, a wide linear detection range of 2 mu M to 8.11 mM, an ultralow detection limit of 0.36 mu M (S/N = 3), an ultrahigh sensitivity of 4374.6 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1), and satisfactory selectivity and reproducibility. Specifically, after 6 weeks, no obvious loss of glucose amperometric signal was observed on HNPG/AuSn. The facile preparation and excellent sensing performance of HNPG/AuSn electrode make sure that it is a promising candidate for advanced enzyme-free glucose sensors.

AB A new, photoelectrochemical immunosensor was proposed on the basis of the La-CdS/3D ZnIn2S4/Au@ZnO sensitization structure for detection of aminoterminal pro-brain natriuretic peptides (NT-proBNP). The Au@ZnO-modified electrode was first assembled with 3D ZnIn2S4, and then further deposited with lanthanum doped cadmium sulfide (La-CdS) via successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction strategy. The Au@ZnO has excellent photoelectric activity and electrical conductivity. The ZnIn2S4 with 3D architectures not only exhibit high photocurrent intensity under visible-light irradiation but also have large surface for the La-CdS deposition. Meanwhile, the La-CdS doped structure could depress the charge recombination, which effectively promotes separation of the generated electron-hole (e(-)/In+) pairs and consequently enhances the photocurrent conversion efficiency. The polydopamine (PDA) was used not only as a cross-linker reagent for the immobilization of the anti-NT-proBNP but also as an electron donor for promoting the photo-generated e(-)/h(+) separation of the semiconductors. Under optimal conditions, the well-designed photoelectrochemical immunoassay exhibited a low detection limit of 0.32 pg mL(-1) and a wide linear range from 0.8 pg mL(-1) to 45 ng mL(-1) for target NT-proBNP detection. Meanwhile, it also presented good reproducibility, specificity, and stability and might open a new promising strategy for the detection of other important tumor markers.

AB Emerging nano-biosensing with suspended MNP microbial extraction and EANP labeling may ensure a secure microbe-free food supply, as rapid response detection of microbial contamination is of utmost importance. Many biosensor designs have been proposed over the past two decades, covering a broad range of binding ligands, signal amplification, and detection mechanisms. These designs may consist of self-contained test strips developed from the base up with complicated nanoparticle chemistry and intricate ligand immobilization. Other methods use multiple step-wise additions, many based upon ELISA 96-well plate technology with fluorescent detection. In addition, many biosensors use expensive antibody receptors or DNA ligands. But many of these proposed designs are impracticable for most applications or users, since they don't FIRST address the broad goals of any biosensor: Field operability, Inexpensive, with Real-time detection that is both Sensitive and Specific to target, while being as Trouble-free as possible. Described in this review are applications that utilize versatile magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) extraction, electrically active nanoparticles (EANP) labeling, and carbohydrate based ligand chemistry. MNP provide rapid pathogen extraction from liquid samples. EANP labeling improves signal amplification and expands signaling options to include optical and electrical detection. Carbohydrate ligands are inexpensive, robust structures that are increasingly synthesized for higher selectivity. Used in conjunction with optical or electrical detection of gold nanoparticles (AuNP), carbohydrate-functionalized MNP-cell-AuNP nano-biosensing advances the goal of being the FIRST biosensor of choice in detecting microbial pathogens throughout our food supply chain.

AB Lactate plays a crucial role in the anaerobic metabolic pathway of humans. In situations of oxygen deficit, its production increases; leading to several life-threatening conditions such as hemorrhage, respiratory failure, trauma or ischemia from lactate acidosis. Lactate level detection and point-of-care (POC) monitoring in a fast, accurate and non-invasive manner is ultimately important for many health care applications. Optical and electrochemical techniques are employed in lactate sensing to achieve high sensitivity and selectivity, miniaturization, portability, simplicity, and low cost. To improve the selectivity and sensitivity, two important enzymes, lactate mddase (LOx) and lactate dehydrogenese (LDH) are employed. Conventional methods for lactate detection are not fast enough to be used in point-of-care or personal health monitoring settings. Moreover, the existing point-of-care lactate sensing tools follow invasive or partially invasive sampling protocols such as finger pricking. In this review, a comprehensive overview of different lactate biosensing devices is presented. Particularly, the state-of-the-art and prospects of wearable, non-invasive lactate sensing from different biofluids are discussed.

AB Biosensors play important roles in different applications such as medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, food safety, and the study of biomolecular interactions. Highly sensitive, label-free and disposable biosensors are particularly desired for many clinical applications. In the past decade, film bulk acoustic resonators (FBARs) have been developed as biosensors because of their high resonant frequency and small base mass (hence greater sensitivity), lower cost, label-free capability and small size. This paper reviews the piezoelectric materials used for FBARs, the optimisation of device structures, and their applications as biosensors in a wide range of biological applications such as the detection of antigens, DNAs and small biomolecules. Their integration with microfluidic devices and high-throughput detection are also discussed.

AB In this work, poly[9,9-dioctylfluoreny1-2,7-diylj (PFO) dots is discovered to display an appealing dual enhancement effect for the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) system of N-(aminobuty1)-N-(ethylisoluminol)/hydrogen peroxide (ABEI/H2O2), which not only enhances the ECL intensity of ABET but also catalyzes decomposition of H2O2 to further amplify the ECL signal of ABEL Owing to the electronegative property of PFO dots, electropositive ABEI-PEI as ECL reagent could be adsorbed on their surface and thus form a novel luminescence emitter (ABEI-PEI-PFO dots) with high ECL efficiency based on electrostatic attraction. Meanwhile, the water solubility and stability of this emitter are improved in virtue of the amine-rich property of ECL reagent (ABET PEI), which could increase the luminous efficiency of ECL reaction in aqueous solution. To increase the electron transfer efficiency, Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs) supported on reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (RGOs) via a onepot synthetic strategy are chosen as immobilizing platform for the ECL emitter (ABEI-PEI-PFO dots). Herein, the obtained dual-amplifed ABEI-PEI-PFO dots-RGOs/PtNPs complex is served as an ideal nanocarrier to capture detection antibody (Ab(2)). According to sandwiched immunoreaction, a highly sensitive ECL immunosensor is constructed for the detection of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) with a linearity from 50 fg ml(-1) to 1 ng(-1) and a detection limit of 16.7 fg mL(-1). The developed ECL emitter combining dual amplified property for signal enhancement purpose would provide new thought and potential for sensitive bioanalysis and clinical application.

AB A novel enhanced photoelectrochemical DNA sensor, based on a TiO2/Au hybrid electrode structure, was developed to detect target DNA. The sensor was developed by successively modifying fluorine-tin oxide (FTO) electrodes with TiO2 nanoparticles, gold (Au) nanoparticles, hairpin DNA (DNA1), and CdSe-COOH quantum dots (QDs), which acted as signal amplification factors. In the absence of target DNA, the incubated DNA1 hairpin and the CdSe-COOH QDs were in close contact with the TiO2/Au electrode surface, leading to an enhanced photocurrent intensity due to the sensitization effect. After incubation of the modified electrode with the target DNA, the hairpin DNA changed into a double helix structure, and the CdSe QDs moved away from the TiO2/Au electrode surface, leading to a decreased sensitization effect and photoelectrochemical signal intensity. This novel DNA sensor exhibited stable, sensitive and reproducible detection of DNA from 0.1 mu M to 10 fM, with a lower detection limit of 3 fM. It provided good specificity, reproducibility, stability and is a promising strategy for the detection of a variety of other DNA targets, for early clinical diagnosis of various diseases.

AB Here, we report for the first time, an electrochemical immunoassay to detect IgM antibodies using lead sulfide quantum dots (PbS QDs) as electrochemical labels. In this sense, dendritic-like polydopamine particles loaded with PbS QDs were synthesized by the self-polymerization of dopamine in basic media in the presence of QDs (PbS@PDA) and further tagged with anti-IgM antibodies, dengue specific antigens, and streptavidin moieties. The analytical features of the sandwich immunoassay on ELISA microplate were carried out with the PbS@PDA-labeled anti-IgM as secondary antibody. The system was interrogated by acid dissolution of PbS@PDA, followed by differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry in the presence of Bi(III) ions using carbon screen-printed electrodes. The results indicate that the voltammetric current increased with the increasing of the concentration of target IgM within a range of 0-0.5 mg mL(-1). The limit of detection of this electrochemical immunoassay was evaluated to 130 ng. The measures of satisfactory recoveries from 88.5% to 114% of spiked samples indicate that such a method has good specificity and is applicable to the quantification of IgM antibodies in complex biological samples. No significant differences at the 0.05 significance level were encountered in the analysis of IgM samples between the electrochemical immunoassay and a Bradford assay.

AB Chlorpyrifos (CP), an organophosphate insecticide is broadly used in the agricultural and industrial sectors to control a broad-spectrum of insects of economically important crops. CP detection has been gaining prominence due to its widespread contamination in different environmental matrices, high acute toxicity, and potential to cause long-term environmental and ecological damage even at trace levels. Traditional chromatographic methods for CP detection are complex and require sample preparation and highly skilled personnel for their operation. Over the past decades, electrochemical biosensors have emerged as a promising technology for CP detection as these circumvent deficiencies associated with classical chromatographic techniques. The advantageous features such as appreciable detection limit, miniaturization, sensitivity, low-cost and onsite detection potential are the propulsive force towards sustainable growth of electrochemical biosensing platforms. Recent development in enzyme immobilization methods, novel surface modifications, nanotechnology and fabrication techniques signify a foremost possibility for the design of electrochemical biosensing platforms with improved sensitivity and selectivity. The prime objective of this review is to accentuate the recent advances in the design of biosensing platforms based on diverse biomolecules and biomimetic molecules with unique properties, which would potentially fascinate their applicability for detection of CP residues in real samples. The review also covers the sensing principle of the prime biomolecule and biomimetic molecule based electrochemical biosensors along with their analytical performance, advantages and shortcomings. Present challenges and future outlooks in the field of electrochemical biosensors based CP detection are also discussed. This deep analysis of electrochemical biosensors will provide research directions for further approaching towards commercial development of the broad range of organophosphorus compounds.

AB The concept of rapid detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) has always been the focal point of modern and future medicine. However, the dispersity and rarity of CTCs in the bloodstream makes it hard to detect metastasis. Herein, our newly designed needle-like cytosensor demonstrates that the capture and analysis of CTCs are a much less laborious process and have more potential than ever. Our aim is to detect and capture CTCs directly in the bloodstream without altering the genetic information; further benefit of current cytosensor is allows for the whole circulation of blood to run through the cytosensor, giving a much better sensitivity and chance of detecting CTCs. Our functionalized needle-like cytosensor has been modified with 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide, N-hydroxysuccinimide and conjugated streptavidin to allow the binding of the biotinylated-antibody of epithelial cell adhesion molecules, which captures targeted colon cancer CTC. The capability of our needle-like cytosensor to detect CTCs spanned from 102 to 106 cells/mL. Beyond this, the needle-like cytosensor avoids the distortion of the cell information. In addition, we constructed a blood flow simulation that mimics human circulating system about 10 mL/min speed; by using cyclic voltammetry we could detect significant signals from captured cancer CTCs more than 21 cells/mL without delay; the fluorescence dye detection was further performed for data confirmation. The future of biosensors begins with this, by providing early monitoring quality care in cancer therapy.

AB Hypertension results due to dysfunction of different metabolic pathways leading to the increased risk of cerebral ischemia, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular and inflammatory disorders. Hypertension has been considered a one of the major contributors to metabolic syndrome and is often referred to as a 'silent killer'. Its incidence is on the rise across the globe owing to the drastic life style changes. The diagnosis of hypertension had been traditionally carried out through measurement of systolic and diastolic blood pressure but in most cases, this form of diagnosis is too late and the disease has already caused organ damage. Therefore, early detection of hypertension by monitoring subtle changes in specific biochemical markers from body fluids can minimize the risk of organ damage. However, a single marker may be insufficient for accurate diagnosis of hypertension thereby necessitating quantification of multiple markers. Concerted efforts to identify key markers for hypertension and their quantification, especially using chemical and biosensors, are underway in different parts of the world. Constant evolution of the sensing elements and transduction strategies have contributed to significant improvements in the diagnosis field, especially in the context of sensitivity, response time and selectivity and this when applied to the detection of hypertension markers may prove beneficial. This review summarizes advances in the field of sensor technology towards the detection of biologically relevant entities, arrays and the next generation lab-on-a-chip' systems for hypertension.

AB Herein, the ternary composites, ultrasmall metal nanoparticles encapsulated in the anionic metal-organic frameworks/electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (MNPs@Y-1, 4-NDC-MOF/ERGO, M = Ag, Cu) are constructed by a cationic exchange strategy and an electrochemical reduction process for the electrochemical determination of H2O2. Both AgNPs@Y-1, 4-NDC-MOF/ERGO and CuNPs@Y-1, 4-NDC-MOF/ERGO display excellent electrocatalytic activity toward H2O2, but the former is superior to the latter. Such a difference in electrocatalytic activity can be explained by the characterization measurements, and the results manifest MNPs@Y-1, 4-NDC-MOF/ERGO (M = Ag, Cu) electrocatalysts have subequal MNPs sizes and electrochemical surface areas, but different electron transfer rate constants. The AgNPs@Y-1, 4-NDC-MOF/ERGO sensor shows a linear detection range from 4 to 11,000 mu M with the detection limit of 0.18 mu M. Moreover, MNPs@Y-1, 4-NDC-MOF/ERGO (M = Ag, Cu) exhibit excellent anti-interference performance and can be used for the detection of H2O2 released from living cells. The proposed sensor takes full advantage of the catalytic property of MNPs, the size selectivity of Y-1, 4-NDC-MOF, and the fast electron transport effect of ERGO. Thus, the MNPs@Y-1, 4-NDC-MOF/ERGO/GCE (M = Ag, Cu) can be utilized to detect oxidase activities by monitoring H2O2 produced in the presence of substrate and oxidase, and it is expected that composites with the molecular sieving effect and catalytic activity can be widely applied for catalysis, biomedicine, and biosensing fields.

   DESIGN
AB A label-free and ultrasensitive electrochemical impedance cytosensor was developed to specifically detect the breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 via the interaction between the mannosyl glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and the overexpressed mannose receptors on the target cell surface. The mannosyl GCE was prepared through electrografting of the amino-functionalized mannose derivatives on GCE surface in which a covalent bond was formed between carbon of the electrode and the amino group of the mannose derivative. The fluorescent microscopy indicated that the electrode is specific for MDA-MB-231 cells, with good biocompatibility for viable captured cells. The derivative with a shorter alkyl linker, mannose-C2NH2, showed a better sensitivity than that with a longer linker, mannose-C6NH2. GCE modified with amino-functionalized galactose derivative, galactose-C2NH2, shows no function to the detection of MDA-MB-231 cells. The specific interaction between the mannosyl GCE and Con A (a mannose-binding lectin) or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with overexpressed mannose receptors was determined through the change of peak separation in the cyclic voltammogram or the change of charge transfer resistance in the electrochemical impedance spectra (Nyquist plot) in the electrolytes containing a reversible redox couple [Fe(CN)(6)](3-)/Fe(CN)(6)](4-). The charge transfer resistance in the Nyquist plots linearly depended on the concentration of MDA-MB-231 cells (1.0 x 10-10 x 10(5) cells mL(-1), with 10 cells mL(-1) being the lower detection limit). Introducing 0.1% polyethylene glycol-200 (PEG-200) was able to prevent the interference caused by 1.0 x 10(3) HEK-293T cells mL(-1), a non-cancer cell line (control).

AB Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was detected in the extracellular matrix of neuronal cells using a dual probe immunosensor (DPI), where one of them was used as a working and another bioconjugate loading probe. The working probe was fabricated by covalently immobilizing capture anti-BDNF (Cap Ab) on the gold nano particles (AuNPs)/conducting polymer composite layer. The bioconjugate probe was modified by drop casting a bioconjugate particles composed of conducting polymer self-assembled AuNPs, immobilized with detection anti-BDNF (Det Ab) and toluidine blue O (TBO). Each sensor layer was characterized using the surface analysis and electrochemical methods. Two modified probes were precisely faced each other to form a microfluidic channel structure and the gap between inside modified surfaces was about 19 mu m. At optimized conditions, the DPI showed a linear dynamic range from 4.0 to 600.0 pg/ml with a detection limit of 1.5 +/- 0.012 pg/ml. Interference effect of IgG, arginine, glutamine, serine, albumin, and fibrinogene were examined and stability of the developed biosensor was also investigated. The reliability of the DPI sensor was evaluated by monitoring the extracellular release of BDNF using exogenic activators (ethanol, K+, and nicotine) in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. In addition, the effect of nicotine onto neuroblastoma cancer cells (SH-SYSY) was studied in detail.

AB Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic and infectious airborne disease which requires a diagnosing system with high sensitivity and specificity. However, the traditional gold standard method for TB detection remains unreliable with low specificity and sensitivity. Nanostructured composite materials coupled with impedimetric sensing utilised in this study offered a feasible solution. Herein, novel gold (Au) nanorods were synthesized on 3D graphene grown by chemical vapour deposition. The irregularly spaced and rippled morphology of 3D graphene provided a path for Au nanoparticles to self-assemble and form rod-like structures on the surface of the 3D graphene. The formation of Au nanorods were showcased through scanning electron microscopy which revealed the evolution of Au nanoparticle into Au islets. Eventually, it formed nanorods possessing lengths of similar to 150 nm and diameters of similar to 30 nm. The X-ray diffractogram displayed appropriate peaks suitable to defect-free and high crystalline graphene with face centered cubic Au. The strong optical interrelation between Au nanorod and 3D graphene was elucidated by Raman spectroscopy analysis. Furthermore, the anchored Au nanorods on 3D graphene nanocomposite enables feasible bio-capturing on the exposed Au surface on defect free graphene. The impedimetric sensing of DNA sequence from TB on 3D graphene/Au nanocomposite revealed a remarkable wide detection linear range from 10 fM to 0.1 mu M, displays the capability of detecting femtomolar DNA concentration. Overall, the novel 3D graphene/Au nanocomposite demonstrated here offers high-performance bio-sensing and opens a new avenue for TB detection.

AB Respiration is as one of the most essential physiological signals, which can be used to monitor human healthcare and activities. Herein, we report a flexible, lightweight and highly conductive porous graphene network as the humidity sensor for respiration monitoring. To enhance the sensing performance, the graphene oxide (GO), poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) and Ag colloids (AC) were used to modify the porous graphene. The humidity properties of porous based graphene networks have been investigated at different relative humidity (RH). The porous based graphene sensors exhibit excellent capability of monitoring different breathing patterns including mouse and nose respiration, normal and deep respiration. Besides, the signal variations before and after water intake was recorded by the sensor, which demonstrates the ability to monitor water loss during breathing period. Furthermore, the humidity sensor shows the ability to detect physiological activities including skin moisture, speaking and whistle rhythm, which could be a promising electronic for clinical respiration monitoring.

AB The serious threats of mercury (Hg2+) and lead (Pb2+) ions for the public health makes it important to achieve the detection methods of the ions with high affinity and specificity. Metal ions usually coexist in some environment and foodstuff or clinical samples. Therefore, it is very necessary to develop a fast and simple method for simultaneous monitoring the amount of metal ions, especially when Hg2+ and Pb2+ coexist. DNAzyme-based biosensors and aptasensors have been highly regarded for this purpose as two main groups of the functional nucleic acid (FNA)-based biosensors. In this review, we summarize the recent achievements of functional nucleic acid -based biosensors for the simultaneous detection of Hg2+ and Pb2+ ions in two main optical and electrochemical groups. The tremendous interest in utilizing the various nanomaterials is also highlighted in the fabrication of the FNA-based biosensors. Finally, some results are presented based on the advantages and disadvantages of the studied FNA-based biosensors to compare their validation.

AB Poly(5-formylindole)/electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (P5FIn/erGO) nanocomposite is firstly used to construct a label-free photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensor to detect carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). As photoactive material and electroactive mediator, the prepared P5FIn/erGO nanocomposite exhibits high photocurrent intensity under visible-light irradiation due to the synergistic effect of P5FIn and erGO. The anti-CEA is connected to the P5FIn/erGO modified electrode surface, and gold nanoparticles (AuNP) is used as cross-linking in the process. The linear decrease of photocurrent is caused by the specific recognition of anti-CEA and CEA. This PEC immunosensor shows a wide linear response to CEA ranging from 0.0005 to 50 ng ml(-1) with a low detection limit of 0.14 pg mL(-1). The proposed immunosensor has good stability, reproducibility and high specificity. The satisfied results are also obtained when this immunosensor is used to detect CEA in actual human serum samples analysis, thus opening up a new promising PEC analysis platform based on conducting polymers.

AB Superoxide dismutases (SODs), a family of ubiquitous enzymes, provide essential protection to biological systems against uncontrolled reactions with oxygen- and nitrogen-based radical species. We review first the role of SODs in oxidative stress and the other biological functions such as peroxidase, nitrite oxidase, thiol oxidase activities etc., implicating its role in neurodegenerative, cardiovascular diseases, and ageing. Also, this review focuses on the development of electrochemical label-free immunosensor for SOD1 and the recent advances in biosensing assay methods based on their catalytic and biological functions with various substrates including reactive oxygen species (superoxide anion radical, hydrogen peroxide), nitric oxide metabolites (nitrite, nitrate) and thiols using thiol oxidase activity. Furthermore, we emphasize the progress made in improving the detection performance through incorporation of the SOD into conducting polymers and nanocomposite matrices. In addition, we address the potential opportunities, challenges, advances in electrochemical-sensing platforms and development of portable analyzer for point-of-care applications.

AB A capacitive electrolyte-insulator-semiconductor (EIS) field-effect biosensor for acetoin detection has been presented for the first time. The EIS sensor consists of a layer structure of Al/p-Si/SiO2/Ta2O5/enzyme acetoin reductase. The enzyme, also referred to as butane-2,3-diol dehydrogenase from B. clausii. DSM 8716(T), has been recently characterized. The enzyme catalyzes the (R)-specific reduction of racemic acetoin to (R,R)- and mesobutane-2,3-diol, respectively. Two different enzyme immobilization strategies (cross-linking by using glutaraldehyde and adsorption) have been studied. Typical biosensor parameters such as optimal pH working range, sensitivity, hysteresis, linear concentration range and long-term stability have been examined by means of constant-capacitance (ConCap) mode measurements. Furthermore, preliminary experiments have been successfully carried out for the detection of acetoin in diluted white wine samples.

AB A dual-target electrochemical aptasensor was developed for the simultaneous detection of multiple antibiotics based on metal ions as signal tracers and nanocomposites as signal amplification strategy. Metal ions such as Cd2+ and Pb2+ could generate distinct differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) peaks. When targets were present, kanamycin (KAN) and streptomycin (STR) as models, the KAN aptamer (KAP) and STR aptamer (STP) were released from their complementary strands, with more change of Cd2+ and Pb2+ corresponding to peak currents. At the same time, complementary strand of KAP (cKAP) and STP (cSTP) were linked with the poly (A) structure (cSTP-PolyA-cKAP) to increase their conformational freedom. Graphitized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTGr) and carbon nanofibers-gold nanoparticles (CNFs-AuNPs) as a biosensor platform enhanced the surface area to capture a large amount of cSTP-PolyA-cKAP, thus amplifying the detection response. Under the optimal conditions, the aptasensor could detect KAN and STR as low as 74.50 pM and 36.45 pM respectively with the range from 0.1 to 100 nM and exhibited excellent selectively. Moreover, this aptasensor showed promising applications for the detection of other analytes by changing corresponding aptamers.

AB Early diagnosis and on-time effective treatment are indispensable for Tuberculosis (TB) control - a life threatening infectious communicable disease. The conventional techniques for diagnosing TB normally take two to three weeks. This delay in diagnosis and further increase in detection complexity due to the emerging risks of XDR-TB (Extensively drug Resistant-TB) and MDR-TB (Multidrug Resistant-TB) are evoking interest of researchers in the field of developing rapid TB detection techniques such as biosensing and other point-of-care (POC) techniques. Biosensing technologies along with the collaboration with nanotechnology have enormous potential to boost the MTB detection and for overall management in clinical diagnosis. A diverse range of portable, sensitive and rapid biosensors based on different signal transducer principles and with different biomarkers detection capabilities have been developed for TB detection in the early stages. Further, a lot of progress has been achieved over the years in developing various point-of-care diagnostic tools including non-molecular methods and molecular techniques. The objective of this study is to present a succinct review of the available TB detection techniques that are either in use or under development. The focus of this review is on the current developments occurred in nano-biosensing technologies. A synopsis of ameliorations in different non-molecular diagnostic tools and progress in the field of molecular techniques along with the role of emerging Lab-on-Chip technology for diagnosing and mitigating the TB consequences have also been presented.

AB Sensitivity amplification strategy by implementing click chemistry in the construction of biosensing interface can efficiently improve the performance of immunosensor. Herein, we developed a sandwich-type amperometric immunosensor for ultrasensitive detection of carbohydrate antigen 24-2 (CA 242) based on pH responsive label-assisted click chemistry triggered sensitivity amplification strategy. The sensitivity of amperometric immunosensor relies on the current response differences (Delta I) caused by per unit concentration target analyte. The pH responsive Cu2+-loaded polydopamine (CuPDA) particles conjugated with detection antibodies were employed as labels, which can release Cu(II) ions by regulating pH. In the presence of ascorbic acid (reductant), Cu (II) ions were reduced to Cu(I) ions. Azide-functionalized double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) as signal enhancer was immobilized on the substrate through Cu+-catalyzed azide/alkyne cycloaddition reaction. With the help of the click reaction, the Delta I caused by target was elevated prominently, resulting in sensitivity amplification of the immunosensor. Under optimal condition, the proposed immunosensor exhibited excellent performance with linear range from 0.0001 to 100 U mL(-1) and ultralow detection limit of 20.74 mu U mL(-1). This work successfully combines click chemistry with pH-responsive labels in sandwich-type amperometric immunosensor, providing a promising sensitivity amplification strategy to construct immunosensing platform for analysis of other tumor marker.

AB An aptamer-based method is described for the electrochemical determination of lysozyme. A glassy carbon electrode was modified with a nanocomposite composed of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), chitosan (CS), and a synthesized carbon quantum dot (CQD) from CS. The composition of the nanocomposite (rGO-MWCNT/CS/CQD) warrants a high surface-to-volume ratio, high conductivity, high stability, and great electrocatalytic activity. This nanocomposite provides a suitable site for better immobilization of aptamers due to the existence of many amino and carboxyl functional groups, and remaining oxygen-related defects properties in rGO. In addition, this nanocomposite allows considerable enhancement of the electrochemical signal and contributes to improving sensitivity. The amino-linked lysozyme aptamers were immobilized on the nanocomposite through covalent coupling between the amino groups of the aptamer and the amino groups of the nanocomposite using glutaraldehyde (GLA) linker. The modified electrode was characterized by electrochemical methods including differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In the presence of lysozyme, the immobilized aptamer selectively caught the target lysozyme on the electrode interface that leads to a decrease in the DPV peak current and an increase in Charge Transfer Resistance (R) in EIS as an analytical signal. Using the obtained data from DPV and EIS techniques, two calibration curves were drawn. The anti-lysozyme aptasensor proposed has two very low LODs. These measures are 3.7 and 1.9 fmol L-1 within the wide detection ranges of 20 fmol L-1 to 10 nmol L-1, and 10 fmol L-1 to 100 nmol L-1 for DPV and EIS calibration curves, respectively. The GCE/rGO-MWCNT/CS/CQD showed sensitivity, high reproducibility, specificity and rapid response for lysozyme which can be used in biomedical fields.

AB Magnetic beads (MB) have been extensively used to produce sensitive and efficient electrochemical magneto-immunosensors. However, MB effective handling requires training, and MB washing after each incubation step is time consuming and contributes to raise result variability. Consequently, most of the electrochemical magneto-immunosensors reported to date, which entailed relatively long and complex multi-step procedures, would be difficult to carry out at point-of-care (POC) settings or by laypersons. For this reason, here we targeted the development of a simplified detection path, which is fast and simple enough to be operated at a POC setting, sufficiently efficient to provide analyte quantitation comparable to classical diagnostic methods, and dependent on minimal technical requirements to facilitate method global exploitation. As a proof-of-concept, we optimized an extremely simple, fast and efficient electrochemical magneto-immunosensor for detection of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). To accomplish this, we optimized MB immunomodification, produced an immunomodified Poly-HRP signal amplifier, developed a single-step magneto-immunoassay, and optimized electrochemical detection using a multiplexed magnetic holder and a ready-to-use commercial substrate solution. The sensor was finally calibrated by detecting MMP-9 in clinical samples. This electrochemical magneto-immunosensor detected MMP-9 in just 12-15 min, displaying linear response between 0.03 and 2 ng mL(-1) of MMP-9, limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of 13 pg mL(-1) and 70 pg mL(-1), respectively, %CV < 6%, and accurate quantification of MMP-9 in patient plasma samples. These results were comparable to those afforded by a 5-h reference ELISA that used the same antibodies, confirming the applicability of our simplified method.

AB An unusual approach is reported herein to fabricate magnetic hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) decorated electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (alpha-Fe2O3@erGO) nanocomposite. The method utilizes direct electrochemical reduction of self-assembled, ex-situ synthesized alpha-Fe2O3 anchored GO to erGO (alpha-Fe2O3@erGO) on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) for selective detection dopamine (DA), an important biomarker of Parkinson's disease. The formation of alpha-Fe2O3@erGO/GCE has been confirmed by XPS and Raman spectroscopy. alpha-Fe2O3@erGO modified GCE exhibits synergistic catalytic activity nearly 2.2 and 5 fold higher than alpha-Fe2O3@GO and other modified electrodes, respectively towards oxidation of DA. The fabricated sensor exhibited linear dynamic ranges over 0.25 - 100 mu M in response to DA with a LOD of 0.024 mu M (S/N = 3), LOQ of 0.08 mu M (S/N = 10), and a sensitivity of 12.56 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2). Finally, the practical analytical application of the proposed alpha-Fe2O3@erGO/GCE was investigated for the determination of DA in commercially available pharmaceutical formulation and human serum samples, and showed satisfactory recovery results towards DA.

AB Folate receptor (FR) is overexpressed in various cancer cells while its expression in normal cells is restricted. The present study provides a new folic acid/folate (FA) functionalized nanomaterials to sense and the differentiation of the cancer cells from normal ones. The reported nanoprobe is based on the mesoporous materials that are functionalized with FA to specify the FR overexpressed cancerous cells. MCF 7 cell lines were used as a model to show the ability of the developed probe for cancer cell detection. The selective binding of FA to FR-positive cells causes the endocytosis of the mesoporous materials into the cells where it can be observed by fluorescence microscopy images. The specific nature of the binding of the FA functionalized mesoporous silica prevents the false detection of normal cells from cancerous cells even in the presence of each other. The cytotoxicity of the n-Pr-NH2-MCM 41-FA on the MCF 7 cells was investigated using MIT assay. The reported method can detect the MCF 7 cells from 100 to 1000 cells/mL. This method provides a selective and nontoxic approach towards detection of breast cancer cell lines while it can be developed as a point of care (POC) device for early detection of cancer. Finally, the MCF 7 cancer cells were treated with doxorubicin anti-cancer drug and our device detect the trace amount of MCF 7 based on their electrochemical activity.

AB Genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in point-of-care (POC) settings could be further improved through simplifying the treatment of samples. In this study, we devised an accurate, rapid and easy-to-use SNP detection system based on direct loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) without DNA extraction, known as Direct-LAMP. Samples from various sources (including whole blood, dried blood spot, buccal swab and saliva), treated with NaOH, can be used directly in amplification. The turnaround time was about 30 min from sample collection to provision of results. The accuracy was evaluated by assessing the polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) Glu504Lys, which are better known for their critical role in folate and ethanol metabolism, respectively. Completely consistent genotyping results reveal that Direct-LAMP is generally concordant with sequencing. This system can serve as a very promising platform in the fields of disease predisposition, drug metabolism and personalized medicine.

AB A dual-wavebands-resolved electrochemiluminescence (ECL) multiplexing immunoassay (MIA) was developed for simultaneously detecting alpha fetoprotein antigen (AFP) in greenish waveband with CdSe550 (lambda(max) = 550 nm) nanocrystals (NCs) and carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) in near-infrared waveband with CdTe790 (lambda(max) = 790 nm) NCs via one-pot ECL reaction, in which dichroic mirror works as a key part to reflect ECL from CdSe550 to one photomultiplier-tube (PMT) and transmit ECL from CdTe790 to the other PMT for dual-wavebands-resolved assay. The proposed ECL-MIA strategy was capable of simultaneously determining AFP with linearly response from 5 pg/mL to 5 ng/mL and limit of detection at 1 pg/mL, and CA125 with linearly response from 5 mU/mL to 1 U/mL and limit of detection at 1 mU/mL, with desired specificity and without obvious energy-transfer between ECL tags. The dichroic mirror assistant ECL setup is easy-to-assemble and convenient for the popularization of color-resolved multiplexing ECL assay.

AB The effectiveness of malaria screening and treatment highly depends on the low-cost access to the highly sensitive and specific malaria test. We report a real-time fluorescence nucleic acid testing device for malaria field detection with automated and scalable sample preparation capability. The device consists a compact analyzer and a disposable microfluidic reagent compact disc. The parasite DNA sample preparation and subsequent realtime LAMP detection were seamlessly integrated on a single microfluidic compact disc, driven by energy efficient non-centrifuge based magnetic field interactions. Each disc contains four parallel testing units which could be configured either as four identical tests or as four species-specific tests. When configured as species-specific tests, it could identify two of the most life-threatening malaria species (P. falciparum and P. vivax). The NAT device is capable of processing four samples simultaneously within 50 min turnaround time. It achieves a detection limit of similar to 0.5 parasites/mu I for whole blood, sufficient for detecting asymptomatic parasite carriers. The combination of the sensitivity, specificity, cost, and scalable sample preparation suggests the real-time fluorescence TAMP device could be particularly useful for malaria screening in the field settings.

AB Lead ion (Pb2+) is a common environmental contaminant, which causes serious bioaccumulation and toxicity in human body. In this work, we developed a novel Pb2+ electrochemical biosensor using the specific DNAzyme on a DNA tetrahedron probe, in the presence of Pb2+, the substrate strand was cleaved into two parts and released a "G-rich" oligo which subsequently formed a G-quadruplex/hemin complex, generating a detectable catalysis current signal with the assistant of H2O2. The 3-D DNA tetrahedron regulated the density and orientation of the probe and thus improved the DNAzyme reaction, and facilitated the complex DNA conformational change in the confined space of the interface on the electrode surface, Finally, the LOD of our biosensor was proved to be 0.008 nM (3 sigma), which is 9000 times lower than the safety limit of EPA (15 mu g/L or 72 nM), and 6000 times lower than IARC (10 mu g/L or 48.26 nM), and more importantly, the specificity and reproducibility of the proposed biosensor was well demonstrated.

AB The detection of antibodies from blood sera is crucial for diagnostic purposes. Miniaturized protein assays in combination with microfluidic setups hold great potential by enabling automated handling and multiplexed analyses. Yet, the separate expression, purification, and storage of many individual proteins are time consuming and limit applicability. In vitro cell-free expression has been proposed as an alternative procedure for the generation of protein assays. We report the successful in vitro expression of different model proteins from DNA templates with an optimized expression mix. His(10)-tagged proteins were specifically captured and immobilized on a Ni-NTA coated sensor surface directly from the in vitro expression mix. Finally, the specific binding of antibodies from rabbit-derived blood sera to the immobilized proteins was monitored by imaging reflectometric interferometry (iRIf). Antibodies in the blood sera could be identified by binding to the respective epitopes with minimal cross reactivity. The results show the potential of in vitro expression and label-free detection for binding assays in general and diagnostic purposes in specific.

AB Herein, a biosensor based on a reduced graphene oxide field effect transistor (rGO-FET) functionalized with the cascading enzymes arginase and urease was developed for the detection of L-arginine. Arginase and urease were immobilized on the rGO-FET sensing surface via electrostatic layer-by-layer assembly using polyethylenimine (PEI) as cationic building block. The signal transduction mechanism is based on the ability of the cascading enzymes to selectively perform chemical transformations and prompt local pH changes, that are sensitively detected by the rGO-FET. In the presence of L-arginine, the transistors modified with (PEI/urease(arginase)) multilayers showed a shift in the Dirac point due to the change in the local pH close to the graphene surface, produced by the catalyzed urea hydrolysis. The transistors were able to monitor L-arginine in the 10-1000 mu M linear range with a LOD of 10 mu M, displaying a fast response and a good long-term stability. The sensor showed stereospecificity and high selectivity in the presence of non-target amino acids. Taking into account the label free, real-time measurement capabilities and the easily quantifiable, electronic output signal, this biosensor offers advantages over state-of-the-art L-arginine detection methods.

AB Regardless of the malaria disease risk, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has an interesting mechanism. During its growth within the red blood cell, toxic free heme is converted into an insoluble crystalline form called the malaria pigment, or hemozoin. In particular, natural hemozoin nanocrystals can provide multiple applications in biosensing fields for health care and diagnosis as similar to artificial metal nanoparticles. In this study, the heme was biologically synthesized and polymerized by Corynebacterium glutamicurn and final polymer was applied as a biomimetic conductive biopolymer. The biosynthesized monomer heme by metabolic engineered strain was enzymatically polymerized by an enzyme complex containing two different heme polymerization proteins. Moreover, the electrical conductivities of hemozoin prepared by heme polymerase enzyme complexes were investigated and compared with those of the heme monomer. Because of the synergetic effects of polymerized heme, synthesized artificial nanocrystals exhibited a greater conductive property than a heme monomer. As a result of their surpassing properties, developed novel magnetoelectric nanocrystals could be motivated as smaller scale electronic devices with advanced properties. Thus, these results will open a brand new field in the frontier of the heme detoxification mechanism of the malaria parasite and its biomimetic application as advanced nanomaterials for biological and biomedical sensing.

First, numerous AT-rich double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) was produced from the conversion of a small amount of target miR-21 via the combination of exonuclease III (Exo III)-assisted amplification and hybridization chain reaction (HCR), which could reduce the aggregation-caused self-etching effect of Cu NCs and improve the emitting of Cu NCs. Simultaneously, the introduction of TiO2 in the sensing interface not just acted as the immobilizer of dsDNA-stabilized Cu NCs, more than acted as the coreaction accelerator to accelerate the reduction of the coreaction reagent (S2O82-) for significantly enhancing the ECL efficiency of Cu NCs. The biosensor showed an excellent linear relationship in the concentration range from 100 aM to 100 pM with the detection limit of 19.05 aM Impressively, the strategy not only opened up a novel and efficient preparation method for the Cu NCs, but expanded the application of Cu NCs in ultrasensitive biodetection owing to the addition of coreaction accelerator.

AB The study presented herein investigated an easy preparation, high performance, wavelength-modulated LSPR optical fiber chemosensor coated by gold nanospheres(AuNS) for Hg2+ detection based on thymine-Hg2+-thymine base pair mismatches and the coupled plasmonic resonance effect.Utilizing electrostatic self-assembly method, the high density and dispersivity monolayer AuNS coated LSPR fiber sensor had the near field refractive index sensitivity up to 2016 nm/RIU. The single-strand probe DNA served as a binding element for free AuNS labelled-target DNA conjugates was attached to the monolayer AuNS by Au-S bond. In the present of Hg2+, the coupled plasmonic resonance band between monolayer AuNS and free AuNS was produced by thymine-Hg2+-thymine structure and leaded to red-shift of LSPR peak. Under the optimal conditions, the enlarged red-shift in peak of LSPR spectroscopy was linearly with the concentration of Hg2+ in the range from 1.0 x 10(-9) to 5.0 x 10(-8) M with the coefficient of 0.976. The limit of detection was 0.7 nM(S/N = 3). The specificity of the sensor was proved high by evaluating the response to other heavy metal ions. The proposed fiber sensor provided a label-free, miniature, low-cost approach for the Hg2+ detection and had potential in real environmental evaluations.

AB The determination of gallic acid (GA) and uric acid (UA) is essential due to their biological properties. Numerous methods have been reported for the analysis of GA and UA in various real samples. However, the development of a simple, rapid and practical sensor still remains a great challenge. Here, a carbon paste electrode (CPE) was modified by nanocomposite containing zirconia nanoparticles (ZrO(2)NPs), Choline chloride (ChCD and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to construct ZrO2-ChCI-AuNPs/CPE as electrochemical sensor for the simultaneous electro-oxidation of GA and UA. Characterization was performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Xray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The modified electrode was investigated by different methods including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Kinetic parameters such as charge transfer coefficient, standard heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant and other parameters were calculated via voltammetry techniques. Differential pulse voltammetry was used for simultaneous determination of GA and UA applying the ZrO2-ChCI-AuNPs/CPE electrode. At the optimum conditions, this sensor showed a linear response in the ranges 0.22- 55 and 0.12-55 M for GA and UA, respectively. In addition, low detection limits of 25 and 15 nM were obtained for GA and UA, respectively. Furthermore, ZrO2-ChCI-AuNPs/CPE was successfully applied for the independent determination of GA in green tea and fruit juice as well as the simultaneous determination of GA and UA in human urine samples.

AB Taking advantages of the toehold-triggered strand displacement reaction (TSDR) and host-guest interaction of beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), a facile enzyme-free and homogeneous electrochemical sensing strategy was designed for the sensitive assay of target DNA using Fe3O4@SiO2@beta-CD nanocomposites and ferrocene-labeled hairpin DNA (H-1) as the capture and electrochemical probes, respectively. Upon addition of target molecule, the initiated TSDR process induced the conformational change of H-1, and subsequently stimulated the dynamic assembly of assist probes (A-1 and A-2) to generate H-1:A-1:A-2 duplex along with the release of target sequence. The released target could drive the next TSDR recycling and finally result in the formation of numerous DNA duplex. After the molecular recognition of Fe3O4@SiO2@beta-CD nanocomposites, a large number of duplex were easily separated from the supernatant solution under an extemal magnetic field, which led to a decreased H-1 concentration in residual solution, concomitant with a remarkable reduction of peak current. Under the optimized conditions, wide linear range (1-5000 pM), low detection limit (0.3 pM), desirable reproducibility, good selectivity, and satisfactory practical analysis were obtained by the combination of the superior recognition capability of beta-CD, TSDR-induced signal amplification, and homogeneous electroanalytical method. The proposed detection strategy could offer a universal approach for the monitoring of various biological analytes via the rational design of probe sequences.

AB In this work, novel multifunctional patchy gold coated Fe3O4 hybrid nanoparticles (PG-Fe3O4 NPs) have been successfully synthesized in aqueous medium via a facile adsorption-reduction method. A rational formation mechanism has been proposed by monitoring the morphological evolution. The PG-Fe3O4 NPs retained the good magnetic property and exhibited excellent catalytical effeciency towards the electrochemical reduction of hydrogen peroxide. Chronoamperometric and amperometric experiments indicated a relatively high catalytic rate constant of 3.13 x 10(5) M-1 s(-1), a high sensitivity of 578.87 pA mM(-1) cm(-2) and a low Michaelis-Menten constant of 462 M. Meanwhile, the introduction of patchy gold could help biofunctionalization via Au-S bond for different biodetection and biosensing purposes. Here, as an example, thiol-terminated aptamers were immobilized onto the patchy gold part as a signal probe to detect carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). A related paper based bipolar electrode-electrochemiluminescence (pBPE-ECL) aptasensor was fabricated as the low-cost, disposable and miniature platform. To improve the sensitivity, Au nanodendrites were electrodeposited at the BPE cathode as the matrix for Apt1 immobilization. This aptasensor showed a wide linear range of 0.1 pg mL(-1)-15 ng mL(-1) with a low detection limit of 0.03 pg mL(-1), remaining competitive against other ones, and also demonstrating the PG-Fe3O4 NPs have promising potential for catalysis and bioassays.

AB Plasmonic colorimetric sensors have emerged as a powerful tool in chemical and biological sensing applications due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) extinction in the visible range. Among the plasmonic sensors, the most famous sensing mode is the "aggregation" plasmonic colorimetric sensor which is based on plasmon coupling due to nanoparticle aggregation. Herein, this review focuses on the newly-developing plasmonic colorimetric sensing mode the etching or the growth of metal nanoparticles induces plasmon changes, namely, "non-aggregation" plasmonic colorimetric sensor. This type of sensors has attracted increasing interest because of their exciting properties of high sensitivity, multi-color changes, and applicability to make a test strip. Of particular interest, the test strip by immobilization of nanoparticles on the substrate can avoid the influence of nanoparticle. auto-aggregation and increase the simplicity in storage and use. Although there are many excellent reviews available that describe the advance of plasmonic sensors, limited attention has been paid to the plasmonic colorimetric sensors based on etching or growth of metal nanoparticles. This review highlights recent progress on strategies and application of "non-aggregation" plasmonic colorimetric sensors. We also provide some personal insights into current challenges associated with "non-aggregation" plasmonic colorimetric sensors and propose future research directions.

AB In this work, a novel, inexpensive and fast strategy was described for selective and effective extraction and determination of propylthiouracil (PTU) with a high polarity (log P = 1.2) based on electromembrane extraction (EME) followed by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). For this purpose, copper nanoparticles (CuNPs)-decorated hollow fiber was used as the selective membrane for EME of PTU in urine samples. The influential parameters on extraction such as extraction solvent, pH, agitation speed, applied potential and extraction time were systematically investigated. In optimized conditions, acceptable linearity was attained between 0.05 and 5 mu g mL(-1) (R-2 value = 0.9994); moreover, superb enrichment factor (200) and repeatability (RSD%, n = 4, 5.7%) for 0.1 g mL(-1) of PTU solution were in desirable range. In addition, extraction recovery of 80.0% was achieved in this condition and the limit of detection (S/N ratio of 3:1) was 0.02 mu g mL(-1). Finally, the proposed method was successfully applied to determine PTU concentration in urine samples.

AB N6-methyladenosine (m6A), one of the most abundant RNA methylation which is ubiquitous in eukaryotic RNA, plays vital roles in many biological progresses. Therefore, the rapid and accurate quantitative detection of m6A is particularly important for its functional research. Herein, a label-free and highly selective electrochemical immunosensor was developed for the detection of m6A. The method is established on that the anti-m6A-Ab can recognize both m6A-RNA and m6A-DNA. An analogous modified DNA probe (L1) serves as a signal molecule, by competing with m6A-RNA for binding to Abs to broaden the linear range. The detection of m6A-RNA by this method is unaffected by the lengths and base sequences of RNA. Under optimal conditions, the proposed immunosensor presented a wide linear range from 0.05 to 200 nM with a detection limit as low as 0.016 nM (S/N = 3). The specificity and reproducibility of the method are satisfactory. Furthermore, the developed immunosensor was validated for m6A determination in human cell lines. Thus, the immunosensor provides a promising platform for m6A-RNA detection with simplicity, high specificity and sensitivity.

AB The ability to view biological events in real time has contributed significantly to research in the life sciences. While video capture of real time changes in anatomical relationships is important, it is equally important to visualize real time changes in the chemical communications that drive cell behaviors. This paper describes an electrochemical imaging system capable of capturing changes in chemical gradients in live tissue slices. The system consists of a CMOS microchip with 8192 configurable Pt surface electrodes, on-chip potentiostat, on-chip control logic, and a microfluidic device designed to interface with the CMOS chip to support ex vivo tissue experimentation. All data processing and visualization methods, sensor calibrations, microfluidics fabrication, and tissue preparation and handling procedures are described. Using norepinephrine as a target analyte for proof of concept, the system is capable of differentiating concentrations of norepinephrine as low as 8 mu M and up to 1024 mu M with a linear response and a spatial resolution of 25.5 mu m x 30.4 mu m. Electrochemical imaging was tested using murine adrenal tissue as a biological model and successfully showed caffeine-stimulated release of catecholamines from live slices of adrenal tissue with temporal sensitivity. This system successfully demonstrates the use of a high-density microelectrode array for electrochemical analysis with high spatiotemporal resolution to gather chemical gradient information in parallel with optical microscopy recordings.

AB An optical fiber interferometric microprobe for detection of specific proteins is presented in this paper. The microprobe is an all-fiber device, which is based on Michelson interferometer configuration, which allows for detection of protein antigens in an analyzed solution thanks to antibodies immobilized on the sensor surface. The interferometer is made of dual core fiber and has a precisely formed arm length difference, achieved by splicing a fragment of polarization maintaining fiber to one of the cores. An all-fiber configuration of the sensor decreases substantially cross-sensitivities to temperature and deformation in comparison to other optical fiber interferometers. Reported sensor has a sensing region on the tip of the interferometer and therefore may be used for point measurements in medicine. The immunosensor and optical measuring system are designed to utilize the most common broadband light sources that operate at a central wavelength of 1.55 mu m. The results show that it is possible to detect a protein antigen present in a solution by using an all-fiber interferometer coated with specific antibodies. The resulting peak shift can reaches 0.6 nm, which is sufficient to be measured by an optical spectrum analyzer or a spectrometer. A model allowing for estimation of the value of lower limit of detection for such sensors has been elaborated. The elaborated detection system may act as a framework for detection of various antigens and thus it can find future applications in medical diagnostics.

AB Herein, an autocatalytic strand displacement amplification (ASDA) strategy was proposed for the first time, which was further ingeniously coupled with hybridization chain reaction (HCR) event for the isothermal, label free and multiple amplification toward nucleic acid detection. During the ASDA module, the target recognition opens the immobilized hairpin probe (IP) and initiates the annealing of the auxiliary DNA strand (AS) with the opened IP for the successive polymerization and nicking reaction in the presence of DNA polymerase and nicking endonuclease. This induces the target recycling and generation of a large amount of intermediate DNA sequences, which can be used as target analogy to execute the autocatalytic strand displacement amplification. Simultaneously, the introduced AS strand can propagate the HCR between two hairpins (H1 and H2) to form a linear DNA concatamer with cytosine (C)-rich loop region, which can facilitate the in-situ synthesis of silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) as electrochemical tags for further amplification toward target responses. With current cascade ASDA and HCR strategy, the detection of target DNA could be achieved with a low detection limit of about 0.16 fM and a good selectivity. The developed biosensor also exhibits the distinct advantages of flexibility and simplicity in probe design and biosensor fabrication, and label-free electrochemical detection, thus opens a promising avenue for the detection of nucleic acid with low abundance in bioanalysis and clinical biomedicine.

AB We designed and constructed a novel aptasensor based on the porous nanostructured bimetallic NiFe-oxides embedded with the mesoporous carbon (represented by NiOxFeOy@mC) for sensitively detecting adenosine triphosphate (ATP), of which the porous NiOxFeOy@mC was derived from the hollow NiFe Prussian blue analogue (hollow NiFe PBA) by calcinating under high temperature. Owning to the excellent electrochemical activity originated from the metal oxides and mesoporous carbon and the strong binding interaction between the aptamer strands and the nanostructure hybrid, the formed porous NiOxFeOy@mC composite calcinated at 900 degrees C exhibited superior sensitivity toward ATP determination in comparison with other porous nanocubes obtained at 500 and 700 degrees C. The proposed aptasensor not only revealed a wide linear range from 5.0 fg.mL(-1) to 5.0 ng with a extremely low detection limit of 0.98 fg.mL(-1) (1.62 fM) (S/N = 3), but also displayed high selectivity towards other interferences, good stability and reproducibility, and acceptable applicability. Therefore, this proposed approach provides a promising platform for ultra-sensitive detection of ATP, further having the potential applications on diagnosis of ATP-related diseases.

Molecular docking computations were performed to design the functional diazonium salt to rationalize the antibody capture on the gate surface. Sensing of 2,4-D was performed through a displacement immunoassay. The limit of detection was estimated at around 23 fM.

AB Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) biosensors have attracted much interest due to their capacity for multiplexing, miniaturization, and high performance, which offers the potential for their integration into lab-on a-chip platforms for point-of-care (POC) diagnostics. The need for microRNA (miRNA)-sensing platforms is particularly urgent because miRNAs are key regulators and biomarkers in numerous pathological processes and diseases. Unfortunately, however, development of such miRNA-sensing platforms has not yet been achieved. In order to realize the detection of these important biomarkers, there has been an increasing demand for POC-sensing platforms that enable label-free quantification with low sample consumption, good sensitivity, real-time responsiveness, and high throughput. Here, we developed a highly specific, sensitive LSPR miRNA-sensing platform on a flexible, scalable plasmonic nanostructure to enable single-base mismatch discrimination and attomole detection of miRNAs in clinically relevant samples. The hairpin probe contained a locked nucleic acid (LNA) that enabled the discrimination of single base mismatches based on differences in melting temperatures of perfectly matched or single base mismatched miRNAs when they formed base pairs with probes. In addition, through hybridization induced signal amplification based on precipitate formation on the gold surface through the enzyme reaction, we observed a dramatic LSPR peak shift, which enabled attomole detection. Additionally, our LSPR miRNA sensor enabled the detection of miR-200a-3p in total RNA extracts from primary cancer cell lines without purification or labeling of the miRNA. This label-free and highly specific miRNA sensing platform may have applications in POC cancer diagnostics without the need for gene amplification.

AB The measurement of pH is important throughout many biological systems, but there are limited available technologies to enable its periodical monitoring in the complex, small volume, media often used in cell culture experiments across a range of disciplines. Herein, pad printed electrodes are developed and characterised through modification with: a commercially available fullerene multiwall carbon nanotube composite applied in Nafion, casting of hydrophobic ubiquinone as a pH probe to provide the electrochemical signal, and coated in Polyethylene glycol to reduce fouling and potentially enhance biocompatibility, which together are proven to enable the determination of pH in cell culture media containing serum. The ubiquinone oxidation peak position (E-pa) provided an indirect marker of pH across the applicable range of pH 6-9 (R-2 = 0.9985, n = 15) in complete DMEM. The electrochemical behaviour of these sensors was also proven to be robust; retaining their ability to measure pH in cell culture media supplemented with serum up to 20% (v/v)[encompassing the range commonly employed in cell culture], cycled > 100 times in 10% serum containing media and maintain > 60% functionality after 5 day incubation in a 10% serum containing medium. Overall, this proof of concept research highlights the potential applicability of this, or similar, electrochemical approaches to enable to detection or monitoring of pH in complex cell culture media.

AB C-type cytochromes (c-cyts) facilitate microbial extracellular electron transfer and play critical roles in bio-geochemical cycling, bioelectricity generation and bioremediation. In this study, a simple and effective method has been developed to detect microbial c-cyts by means of peroxidase mimetic reaction on screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE). To this end, bacteria cells were immobilized onto the working electrode surface of SPCE by a simple drop casting. After introducing 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution, microbial c-cyts with peroxidase-like activity catalyze the oxidation of TMB in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The oxidized TMB was electrochemically determined and the current signal was employed to calculate the c-cyts content. This electrochemical method is highly sensitive for microbial c-cyts with a low detection limit of 40.78 fmol and a wide detection range between 51.70 fmol and 6.64 pmol. Moreover, the proposed technique can be universally expanded to detect c-cyts in other bacteria species such as Pontibacter ferrireducens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Comamonas guangdongensis and Escherichia col. Furthermore, the proposed method confers an in situ facile and quantitative c-cyts detection without any destructive sample preparations, complex electrode modifications and expensive enzyme-or metal particle-based signal amplification. The suggested method advances an intelligent strategy for in situ quantification of microbial c-cyts and consequently holds promising application potential in microbiology and environmental science.

AB Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), a significant serum cytokine, is an important protein biomarker in diagnosis and recognition of cancer, which straightly rolled in proceeding of various cell transformations, including tumor growth and its development. Fibrosis, atherosclerosis are certain appalling diseases, which PDGF-BB is near to them. Generally, the expression amount of PDGF-BB increases in human life-threatening tumors serving as an indicator for tumor angiogenesis. Thus, identification and quantification of PDGF-BB in biomedical fields are particularly important. Affinity chromatography, immunohistochemical methods and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), conventional methods for PDGF-BB detection, requiring high-cost and complicated instrumentation, take too much time and offer deficient sensitivity and selectivity, which restrict their usage in real applications. Hence, it is essential to design and build enhanced systems and platforms for the recognition and quantification of protein biomarkers. In the past few years, biosensors especially aptasensors have been received noticeable attention for the detection of PDGF-BB owing to their high sensitivity, selectivity, accuracy, fast response, and low cost. Since the role and importance of developing aptasensors in cancer diagnosis is undeniable. In this review, optical and electrochemical aptasensors, which have been applied by many researchers for PDGF-BB cancer biomarker detection, have been mentioned and merits and demerits of them have been explained and compared. Efforts related to design and development of aptamer-based biosensors using nanoparticles for sensitive and selective detection of PDGF-BB have been reviewed considering: Aptamer importance as recognition elements, principal, application and the recent improvements and developments of aptamer based optical and electrochemical methods. In addition, commercial biosensors and future perspectives for rapid and on-site detection of PDGF-BB have been summarized.

AB Exosomes are natural spherical phospholipids vesicles derived from cells. Dropping MCF-7 exosome (with high biomarkers as exosomal case) covalently onto the SCPE-GNP causes the sensor to be stable due to the electro-chemical induction of positive charges of different biomarkers with [Fe(CN)6](-3/-4) reactions. In the following, the covalent p19 connection with the biomarkers of exosome turns off the sensor. After adding the hybrid of miR21-probe, its tight coupling to p19 has reestablished the system. As a result, this sensor has been able to detect miR21 with high sensitivity and specificity. For the first time, the exosomal electrochemical properties were proven as the electrochemical amplifier bed. The limit of detection (LOD) was 1 a.M. due to the existence of various biomarkers for connecting covalent to p19. Electrochemical impedance (EIS) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) are used for miR sensing on the MCF-7 exosome-p19 composite. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Ultraviolet Visible (UV) spectroscopic techniques are used to understand the interactions between each layer. These vesicles can be used as a natural source for biocompatible devices that are used in transfection using an electrochemical method at a cost-effective and high-performance basis.

AB Amyloid-beta oligomers (A beta O) are considered to be reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer' disease (AD), and the cellular prion protein (PrPC) is identified as a receptor for A beta O. We demonstrated a label and antibody-free electrochemical biosensor for the selective detection of A beta O using an electrically conductive poly (pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid) (PPyCOOH) linking agent and PrPC receptor. In the fabrication of the biosensor, each step was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The developed PrPc/PPyCOOH biosensor exhibited extremely low detection limit of 10(-4) pM with high sensitivity which is desirable for the early diagnosis of AD. The sensing performance was further confirmed by the mice infected with AD. The proposed sensor emerged as a promising tool for the early detection of A beta O.

AB This paper reports the development and performance of an electrochemical immunosensor using magnetic multiwalled carbon nanotubes (m-MWCNTs) as nanocarrier tags for the determination of human fetuin A (HFA), a relevant biomarker of obesity, insulin resistance, and type-2 diabetes as well as for pancreatic and liver cancers and inflammatory processes. Screen-printed carbon electrodes were grafted with p-aminobezoic acid and streptavidin was covalently immobilized on the electrode surface. A biotinylated capture antibody was immobilized through streptavidin-biotin interaction and a sandwich assay configuration was implemented using m-MWCNTs conjugated with HRP and anti-HFA antibodies as the detection label. The determination of HFA was accomplished by measuring the current produced by the electrochemical reduction of benzoquinone at -200 mV upon addition of H2O2 as HRP substrate. The prepared m-MWCNTs were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD and EDS. All the steps involved in the immunosensor preparation were monitored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. A linear calibration plot for HFA was found between 20 and 2000 pg/mL with a LOD value of 16 pg/mL. This performance is notably better than that reported for an ELISA kit and a chronoimpedimetric immunosensor. The favorable contribution of m-MWCNTs in comparison with MWCNTs without incorporated magnetic particles to this excellent analytical performance is also highlighted. The immunosensor selectivity against other proteins and potentially interfering compounds was excellent. In addition, the usefulness of the immunosensor was demonstrated by the analysis of HFA in saliva with minimal sample treatment.

AB We report on the use of a laser-direct write (LDW) technique that allows the fabrication of lateral flow devices with enhanced sensitivity and limit of detection. This manufacturing technique comprises the dispensing of a liquid photopolymer at specific regions of a nitrocellulose membrane and its subsequent photopolymerisation to create impermeable walls inside the volume of the membrane. These polymerised structures are intentionally designed to create fluidic channels which are constricted over a specific length that spans the test zone within which the sample interacts with pre-deposited reagents. Experiments were conducted to show how these constrictions alter the fluid flow rate and the test zone area within the constricted channel geometries. The slower flow rate and smaller test zone area result in the increased sensitivity and lowered limit of detection for these devices. We have quantified these via the improved performance of a C-Reactive Protein (CRP) sandwich assay on our lateral flow devices with constricted flow paths which demonstrate an improvement in its sensitivity by 62x and in its limit of detection by 30x when compared to a standard lateral flow CRP device.

AB In this present work we made a novel, fast, selective and sensitive electrochemical genobiosensor to detection of EGFR exon 21 point mutation based on two step electropolymerization of Ni(II)-oxytetracycline conducting metallopolymer nanoparticles (Ni-OTC NPs) on the surface of pencil graphite electrode (PGE) which was modified by reduced graphene oxide/carboxyl functionalized ordered mesoporous carbon (rGO/f-OMC) nano composite. ssDNA capture probe with amine groups at the 5' end which applied as recognition element was immobilized on the rGO/f-OMC/PGE surface via the strong amide bond. Ni-OTC metallopolymer NPs were electropolymerized to rGO/ssDNA-OMC/PGE surface and then hybridization fallows through the peak current change in differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) using Ni-OTC NPs as a redox label. The biosensor was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), FT-IR spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), cyclic voltammetry and Nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis. The Ni-OTC current response verified only the complementary sequence indicating a significant reduction current signal in comparison to single point mismatched and non-complementary and sequences. Under optimal conditions, the prepared biosensor showed long-term stability (21 days) with a wide linear range from 0.1 mu M to 3 mu M with high sensitivity (0.0188 mA/mu M) and low detection limit (120 nM).

AB An ultrasensitive electrochemical genosensor has been fabricated for the double determination of two different specific sequences deduced from the maternally expressed gene3 (MEG3) IncRNA (long noncoding RNA), which was demonstrated by coupling RNase A-aided target recycling with DNA supersandwich-induced signal enhancement, based on a composite interface of graphene-like tungsten disulfide/dendritic gold nanostructures (WS2/DGN). Firstly, duple target sequences of T-1 and T-2 were captured by the primer probes of P-1/P-2 functionalized Fe3O4@C magnetic nanoparticles, via the DNA/RNA hybridization between T-1/T-2 and P-1/P-2. In the presence of RNase A, T-1 and T-2 were released to trigger the target recycling, accompanied by the generation of numerous intermediate DNAs designated as IT1 and IT2, respectively. After the magnetic separation, the IT1 and IT2 were liberated and hybridized with the capture probes of CP1/CP2 loaded DGN/WS2 modified electrode. Subsequently, the stepwise DNA hybridization chain reactions (HCR) labeled with ferrocene (Fc) and methyleneblue (MB) were processed, respectively. The DPV current values of Fc and MB were recorded, which were proportional with the concentration of T-1 and T-2, respectively. Using the multiplexed amplification strategy, this newly designed genosensor provided a wide linear range from 1 fM to 100 pM with a low detection limit of 0.25 fM for T-1 and 0.3 fM for T-2. The application of the genosensor in real serum sample has also been studied, confirming the excellent selectivity and sensitivity for the application in bioanalysis and clinical diagnostics.

AB Tuberculosis, an ailment caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) complex, is one of the catastrophic transmittable diseases that affect human. Reports published by WHO indicate that in 2017 about 6.3 million people progressed to TB and 53 million TB patients died from 2000 to 2016. Therefore, early diagnosis of the disease is of great importance for global health care programs. Common diagnostics like the traditional PPD test and antibody-assisted assays suffer the lack of sensitivity, long processing time and cumbersome post-test proceedings. These shortcomings restrict their use and encourage innovations in TB diagnostics. In recent years, the biosensor concept opened up new horizons in sensitive and fast detection of the disease, reducing the interval time between sampling and diagnostic result. Among new diagnostics, label-free nano-biosensors are highly promising for sensitive and accessible detection of tuberculosis. Various specific label-free nano-biosensors have been recently reported detecting the whole cell of M. tuberculosis, mycobacterial proteins and IFN-gamma as crucial markers in early diagnosis of TB. This article provides a focused overview on nanomaterial-based label-free biosensors for tuberculosis detection.

AB The cellular enzyme poly ADP (ADP: adenosine diphosphate)-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) plays key roles in DNA repair. Its activity is closely related to various cancer developments. Detection of PARP-1 activity is significant, however, it is relatively difficult since it lacks superiority property that can be used to detect conveniently. PARP-1 lead to the synthesis of hyperbranched poly (ADP -ribose) polymers (PAR) using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) as substrate during DNA damage repairing. In this paper, we found that hyper-branched PAR increased the steric hindrance and reduced the flux of probe ions effectively in anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) nanochannels. To the best of our knowledge, few papers have been reported that hyper-branched polymer has the similar effects in nanochannels as G-quadntplex DNA. Thus, a novel and simple strategy for PARP-1 detection has been proposed due to its great impacts on the diffusion flux of ferricyanide in AAO. It is also proved that electrostatic repulsion is another important factor to influence the current. The method is label free, simple and sensitive. Quantitative detection of PARP-1 activity was achieved with the detection limit of 0.006 U, which is lower or comparable to the most reported methods. The method has good accuracy and reproducibility. The strategy has been used to detect PARP-1 activity in real breast cancer cells and to evaluate PARP-1 inhibitors with satisfactory results, indicating that it is a potential powerful tool for clinical diagnosis and drug development in the future.

AB Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is a specific and sensitive biomarker for the early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction and for the subsequent clinical treatments. In this work, novel electrochemical sensing platform for sensing of cTnI based on aptamer-MoS2 nanoconjugates was proposed. For comparison, core-shell Au@SiO2@Au nanoparticles were also used for sensing of cTnI. The sensing schemes and electrochemical responses of the proposed sensors were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 5.0 mM K-3[Fe(CN)(6)]/K-4[Fe(CN)(6)] (1:1) solution containing 0.1 M KCl, respectively. Results showed that the aptamer-Au@SiO2@Au based aptasensor shows a linear rage of 10 pM-10.0 mu M with the detection limits of 1.23 pM For the aptamer-MoS2 nanosheets based aptasensor, the linear range for cTnI detection was from 10 pM to 1.0 mu M with a lower detection limit of 0.95 pM Meanwhile, both the sensors were successfully applied for detection of cTnI in human blood samples. The two kinds of aptsensors have been successfully used for detecting of cTnI in human blood serums. Moreover, no negligible signal changes could be observed in the presence of non-targets of CK-MB and Myo, suggesting the good potential for clinic diagnosis.

Encapsulation of tin dioxide-functionalised reduced graphene oxide (rGO-SnO2) and gold and platinum alloys (AuPt alloys) onto the surface of hollow nanobox metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) was performed to prepare rGO-SnO2/hollow nanobox-MOFs/AuPt alloys (rGO-SnO2/HNMs/AuPt) as the matrix. SiO2-Ab(2), which is used as the signal-decreased label, can be utilised to enhance the distinction of the electrochemical signal after the specific recognition between antibodies and antigens, owing to its large steric hindrance property. In this sensor, this proposed sandwich immunosensor can achieve a high sensitivity, especially in the presence of low concentrations of the LAG-3 protein. Under optimal conditions, this sandwich-designed immunosensor exhibited a sensitive detection of the LAG-3 protein from concentrations of 0.01 ng mL(-1) to 1 mu g mL(-1), with a lower detection limit of 1.1 pg mL(-1) (based on 30). We proposed that this ultrasensitive biosensor can be utilised for the detection of the LAG-3 protein in early clinical tumour diagnosis.

AB Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a neglected tropical disease transmitted by mosquitoes and the second cause of permanent disability leading to a significant morbidity and mortality rate. Previously, we have identified epitopes of the filarial abundant larval transcript-2 (ALT-2) protein using a microarray mapping. In this study, one of the epitopes (Wb/ALT2-A5) was used to construct an electrochemical immunosensor. Electrochemical technique of cyclic voltammetry was performed for detecting the signal generated by the interaction between the (Wb/ALT2-A5) peptide and circulating antibodies of serum human samples. (Wb/ALT2-A5) epitope antigens were successfully immobilized on the working electrode of a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) by their amine groups via chitosan film by coupling with glutaraldehyde as crosslinker. After the sensor ready, a pool of human sera infected with Wuchereria bancrofti was added to its surface. Electrochemical responses were generated by applying a potential of - 0.6 to 0.6 V, scan rate of 0.025 V/s. A detection limit of 5.0 mu g mL(-1) for the synthetic peptides (Wb/ALT2-A5) and 0.002 mu g mL(-1) for human serum, with a sensitivity of 1.86 A. The performance of this assay was successfully tested in human serum samples from infected and healthy patients. Thus, this proposed immunosensor, which is able to identify circulating antibodies, can be applied to the diagnosis of the W. bancrofti parasitic disease.

AB In this study, a photo-bioelectrochemical fuel cell was constructed for photocurrent generation by illuminating the electrodes within an aqueous solution. In this purpose, gold electrode was coated with poly 4-(4H-Dithieno [3,2-b:2',3'-d]pyrol-4-yl) aniline, P(DTP-Ph-NH2) conductive polymer film by using electrochemical polymerization. Then, P(DTP-Ph-NHO conductive polymer film coated surface was electrochemically modified with cytochrome C which covalently linked onto the surface via bis-aniline functionality of the polymer film and formed crosslinked-structure. The thylakoid membrane was attached on the surface of this electrode by using bissulfosaxinimidyl suberate (BS3) and used as photo-anode in photo-bioelectrochemical fuel cell. The photocathode of the photo-bioelectrochemical fuel cell fabrication was followed by the modification of conductive polymer poly[5-(4H-dithieno [3,2-b:2',3'-d]pyrol-4-yl) naphtalene-l-amine] film coating, glutaraldehyde activation, and bilirubin oxidase enzyme immobilization. During the photosynthesis occurring in thylakoid membrane under the light, water was oxidized and separated; while oxygen was released in anode side, the cathode side was reduced the oxygen gas into the water via a bio-electro-catalytic method. The cytochrome C was used for binding of thylakoid membrane to the electrode surface and play an important role for transferring of electrons released as a result of photosynthesis.

AB Zika virus (ZIKV) recently emerged as a global threat subsequent to its global spread because it induces microencephaly and other brain damages in infants born to infected mothers. Epidemiological monitoring of infection has been hampered by the absence of reliable serological tests capable to distinguish between ZIKV and other Flavivirus infections, in particular Dengue virus (DENV). As both viruses are transmitted by the same mosquito-species, their distributions largely overlap and reliable serological distinction between the viruses is essential. Here we develop a novel biosensor which is based on recombinant forms of ZIKV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and the domain III of the envelope protein (EDIII). Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and square wave voltammetry (SWV), we demonstrate that in addition to extremely sensitive detection of ZIKV-specific antibodies in serum and saliva, the biosensor promptly distinguished ZIKV and DENV-specific antibodies. Hence, this novel biosensor allows assessing ZIKV antibodies in blood and saliva and results are unaffected by presence of DENV virus-specific antibodies.

AB Effective treatment of cancer depends upon the early detection of the tumor marker. Here, we report on the development of a new immunosensor for early detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Cubic Au@Pt dendritic nanomaterials functionalized nitrogen-doped graphene loaded with copper ion (Au@Pt DNs/NG/Cu2+) with enhanced peroxidase-like properties was synthesized as labels to effectively capture and immobilize secondary anti-CEA. The Au@Pt DNs with more active surface area could efficiently enhance electrocatalysis for reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Meanwhile, with good conductivity and large specific surface area, NG can immobilize a large amount of Au@Pt DNs. Furthermore, after adsorbed Cu2+ can further promote the redox of H2O2 and amplify the signal of the immunosensor. For the immobilization of primary antibodies, Au nano particles functionalized polydopamine (Au@PDA) were used as transducing materials to modify glassy carbon electrodes and enhance the electron transfer efficiently. Under optimal conditions, the immunosensor exhibited a satisfactory response to CEA with a limit detection of 0.167 pg/mL and linear detection range from 0.5 pg/mL to 50 ng/mL. Based on the high sensitivity and specificity of the immunosensor, we propose this multiple amplified biosensor for early detection of CEA.

AB In this study, a facile solution approach was developed for the synthesis of a series of core-shell structured Ag@Cu2O nanocrystals of various shapes including triangles, spheres, and cubes with well-defined stable heterojunctions. The electrooxidation of dopamine (DA), uric acid (UA), guanine (G), and adenine (A) using these hybrids revealed morphology-dependent sensing properties, with activities and accumulation ability following the order, triangular Ag@Cu2O > spherical Ag@Cu2O > cubic Ag@Cu2O. Further, we constructed a novel graphene oxide (GO) nanosheet-reinforced triangular Ag@Cu2O ternary hetero-nanostructure. Such a hybrid with a three-dimensional interconnected hierarchical architecture is suitable for catalysis, since it not only leads to improved interfacial electron transfer, but also readily exposes the highly catalytic Ag@Cu2O to the reactants. Therefore, more enhanced electrochemical activities were observed for the oxidation of DA, UA, G, and A. This study provides an efficient way to synthesize morphology-controlled Ag@Cu2O heterogeneous catalysts for the fabrication of potential biosensors, and also opens up attractive avenues in the design of multifunctional ternary noble metal-semiconductor-carbon hybrids.

AB Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is the most significant biomarker for the screening of prostate cancer in human serum. However, most methods for the detection of PSA often require major laboratories, precisely analytical instruments and complicated operations. Currently, the design and development of satisfying electrochemical biosensors based on biomimetic materials (e.g. synthetic receptors) and nanotechnology is highly desired. Thus, we focused on the combination of molecular recognition and versatile nanomaterials in electrochemical devices for advancing their analytical performance and robustness. Herein, by using the present prepared multifunctional hydroxyl pillar[5]arene@gold nanoparticles@graphitic carbon nitride (HP5@AuNPs@g-C3N4) hybrid nanomaterial as robust biomimetic element, a high-performance electrochemical immunosensor for detection of PSA was constructed. The as-prepared immunosensor, with typically competitive advantages of low cost, simple preparation and fast detection, exhibited remarkable robustness, ultra-sensitivity, excellent selectivity and reproducibility. The limit of detection (LOD) and linear range were 0.12 pg mL(-1) (S/N = 3) and 0.0005-10.00 ng respectively. The satisfying results provide a promising approach for clinical detection of PSA in human serum.

AB A novel electrochemiluminescence (ECL) signal-off strategy based on CuS in situ grown on reduced graphene oxide (CuS-rGO) quenching luminol/H2O2 system was firstly proposed. Luminol was grafted on the surface of Au@Fe3O4-Cu-3(PO4)(2) nanoflowers (Luminol-Au@Fe3O4-Cu-3(PO4)(2)) which exhibited excellent catalytic effect towards the reduction of H2O2 to enhance the ECL intensity of luminol. Cu-3(PO4)(2) nanoflowers showed large surface area which can immobilize more Fe3O4 and Au nanoparticles. The quenching mechanism of CuS-rGO was due to ECL resonance energy transfer (RET). The spectral overlap between fluorescence spectrum of Luminol-Au@Fe2O4-Cu-3(PO4)(2) and UV-vis absorption spectrum of CuS-rGO revealed that resonance energy transfer was possible. Au nanoparticles were immobilized on the surface of CuS-rGO to capture secondary antibodies. After a sandwich-type immunoreaction, a remarkable decrease of ECL signal was observed. Under the optimal conditions, the immunosensor showed excellent performance for N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) detection with a wide detection range from 0.5 pg mL(-1) to 20 ng mL(-1) and a low detection limit of 0.12 pg(-1) (S/N = 3). The prepared NT-proBNP immunosensor displayed high sensitivity, excellent stability and good specificity.

AB Gram-negative bacteria are one of the most common microorganisms in the environment. Their differential detection and recognition from Gram-positive bacteria has been attracting much attention over the years. Using Escherichia colt (E. colt) as a model, we demonstrated on-site detection of Gram-negative bacteria by an AC electrokinetics-based capacitive sensing method using commercial microelectrodes functionalized with an aptamer specific to lipopolysaccharides. Dielectrophoresis effect was utilized to enrich viable bacteria to the microelectrodes rapidly, achieving a detection limit of 10(2) cells/mL within a 30 s' response time. The sensor showed a negligible response to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), a Gram-positive species. The developed sensor showed significant advantages in sensitivity, selectivity, cost, operation simplicity, and response time. Therefore, this sensing method has shown great application potential for environmental monitoring, food safety, and realtime diagnosis.

AB One pressing concern today is to construct sensors that can withstand various disturbances for highly selective and sensitive detecting trace analytes in complicated samples. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) with tailor-made binding sites are preferred to be recognition elements in sensors for effective targets detection, and fluorescence measurement assists in highly sensitive detection and user-friendly control. Accordingly, molecular imprinting-based fluorescence sensors (MI-FL sensors) have attracted great research interest in many fields such as chemical and biological analysis. Herein, we comprehensively review the recent advances in MI-FL sensors construction and applications, giving insights on sensing principles and signal transduction mechanisms, focusing on general construction strategies for intrinsically fluorescent or nonfluorescent analytes and improvement strategies in sensing performance, particularly in sensitivity. Construction strategies are well overviewed, mainly including the traditional indirect methods of competitive binding against pre-bound fluorescent indicators, employment of fluorescent functional monomers and embedding of fluorescence substances, and novel rational designs of hierarchical architecture (core-shell/hollow and mesoporous structures), post-imprinting modification, and ratiometric fluorescence detection. Furthermore, MI-FL sensor based microdevices are discussed, involving micromotors, test strips and microfluidics, which are more portable for rapid point-of-care detection and in-field diagnosing. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives of MI-FL sensors are proposed.

AB Red blood cells (RBCs) aggregability A(G) of coagulating blood in extracorporeal circulation system has been investigated under the condition of pulsatile flow. Relaxation frequency f(c) from the multiple-frequency electrical impedance spectroscopy is utilized to obtain RBCs aggregability AG. Compared with other methods, the proposed multiple-frequency electrical impedance method is much easier to obtain non-invasive measurement with high speed and good penetrability performance in biology tissues. Experimental results show that, RBCs aggregability AG in coagulating blood falls down with the thrombus formation while that in non-coagulation blood almost keeps the same value, which has a great agreement with the activated clotting time (ACT) fibrinogen concertation (4,) tests. Modified Hanai formula is proposed to quantitatively analyze the influence of RBCs aggregation on multiple-frequency electrical impedance measurement. The reduction of RBCs aggregability AG is associated with blood coagulation reaction, which indicates the feasibility of the high speed, compact and cheap on-line thrombus measurement biosensors in extracorporeal circulation systems.

AB A biosensor chip integrated interdigital microelectrodes was proposed and applied to monitor the formation process of Salmonella and E. coli biofilms in this paper. The biosensor chip was composed of a glass substrate with interdigital microelectrodes and PDMS layer with micro cavities. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of Salmonella and E. coli biofilms was measured by the biosensor chip using alternating voltage of 100 my in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 100 kHz for 48 h. It was illustrated that the changes of impedance spectroscopy of biofilms occurred with culture time. Furthermore, impedance spectroscopy of biofilms was fitted by an equivalent circuit model including the biofilms capacitance (C-b) and the biofilms resistance (R-b) parameters. The results indicated that the Cb presented a tendency to decrease first and then rise with culture time, while the Rb was in the opposite direction. These changing trends were consistent with the formation process of biofilms that bacteria adhered to electrodes surface, and then formed mature biofilms, finally escaped from biofilms. In addition, it was also demonstrated that the changing trends of Cb and Rb with culture time were quite different between Salmonella and E. coli. The results obtained by impedance detection were in accordance with the results of using crystal violet staining to analyze biofilms formation process, under the same conditions for bacterial culture. The biosensor chip provided a promising platform for further study of biofilms owing to its unique advantages of real time, continuity, and non-invasion for bacteria biofilms detection and in-situ monitoring.

AB Herein, a visible light photoelectrochemical (PEC) platform based on polyaniline (PANI) and nanoMoS(2) composites as optoelectronic material for glutathione detection without any auxiliary of biomolecules or labeled materials was developed. Firstly, the nanoMoS(2) was prepared via a simple ultrasound exfoliation method. The PANI was synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerization method. Then composite of PANI and nanoMoS(2) was used to modify gold electrode. It was found that the composite membrane showed excellent PEC properties. And glutathione enhanced the PEC signal greatly. Based on this finding a method for glutathione detection was fabricated. Under the optimum conditions, the linear response of glutathione concentrations ranged from 1.0 x 10(-10) to 1.0 x 10(-4) mol L-1 was obtained with a detection limit of 3.1 x 10(-11) mol L-1. The relative standard deviation was 2.9% at 2.0 x 10(-9) M (n = 10). This method showed high sensitivity and simpleness which opened up a new promising signal-on PEC platform for future bioassay.

AB The direct growth of self-supported metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) thin film can be considered as an effective strategy for fabrication of the advanced modified electrodes in sensors and biosensor applications. However, most of the fabricated MOFs-based sensors suffer from some drawbacks such as time consuming for synthesis of MOF and electrode making, need of a binder or an additive layer, need of expensive equipment and use of hazardous solvents. Here, a novel free-standing MOFs-based modified electrode was fabricated by the rapid direct growth of MOFs on the surface of the glassy carbon electrode (GCE). In this method, direct growth of MOFs was occurred by the formation of vertically aligned arrays of Cu clusters and Cu(OH)(2) nanotubes, which can act as both mediator and positioning fixing factor for the rapid formation of self-supported MOFs on GCE surface. The effect of both chemically and electrochemically formed Cu(OH)(2) nanotubes on the morphological and electrochemical performance of the prepared MOFs were investigated. Due to the unique properties of the prepared MOFs thin film electrode such as uniform and vertically aligned structure, excellent stability, high electroactive surface area, and good availability to analyte and electrolyte diffusion, it was directly used as the electrode material for non-enzymatic electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose. Moreover, the potential utility of this sensing platform for the analytical determination of glucose concentration was evaluated by the amperometry technique. The results proved that the self-supported MOFs thin film on GCE is a promising electrode material for fabricating and designing non-enzymatic glucose sensors.

AB In this research, an enzyme-free and label-free surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensing strategy has been developed for ultrasensitive detection of fusion gene based on the heterogeneous target-triggered DNA self assembly aptamer-based hydrogel with streptavidin (SA) encapsulation. In the presence of target, the capture probes (Cp) immobilized on the chip surface can capture the PML/RARa, forming a Cp-PML/RARa duplex. After that, the aptamer-based network hydrogel nanostructure is formed on the gold surface via target-triggered self assembly of X shaped polymers. Subsequently, the SA can be encapsulated into hydrogel by the specific binding of SA aptamer, forming the complex with super molecular weight. Thus, the developed strategy achieves dramatic enhancement of the SPR signal. Using PML/RARa "S" subtype as model analyte, the developed biosensing method can detect target down to 45.22 fM with a wide linear range from 100 fM to 10 nM. Moreover, the high efficiency biosensing method shows excellent practical ability to identify the clinical PCR products of PML/RARa. Thus, this proposed strategy presents a powerful platform for ultrasensitive detection of fusion gene and early diagnosis and monitoring of disease.

AB Both pH-sensitive and glucose-responsive rhodium oxide nanocorals (Rh2O3 NCs) were synthesized through electrospinning followed by high-temperature calcination. The as-prepared Rh2O3 NCs were systematically characterized using various advanced techniques including scanning electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, and then employed as a dual functional nanomaterial to fabricate a dual sensor for both non-enzymatic glucose sensing and solid-state pH monitoring. The sensing performance of the Rh2O3 NCs based dual sensor toward pH and glucose was evaluated using open circuit potential, cyclic voltammetry and amperometric techniques, respectively. The results show that the as-prepared Rh2O3 NCs not only maintain accurate and reversible pH sensitivity of Rh2O3, but also demonstrate a good electrocatalytic activity toward glucose oxidation in alkaline medium with a sensitivity of 11.46 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), a limit of detection of 3.1 mu M (S/N = 3), and a reasonable selectivity against various interferents in non-enzymatic glucose detection. Its accuracy in determining glucose in human serum samples was further demonstrated. These features indicate that the as-prepared Rh2O3 NCs hold great promise as a dual-functional sensing material in the development of a high-performance sensor forManjakkal both solid-state pH and non-enzymatic glucose sensing.

AB 18-facet polyhedron Cu7S4 nanocrystal and CuS sphere were prepared from Cu2O precursor, and CuS flower was synthesized through a simple solvothermal approach. Their electrochemical performances were investigated towards H2O2 and it was interesting to discover that Cu7S4 nanocrystal had the best electrochemical catalysis compared with CuS sphere and CuS flower. It can deduce that the special structure of Cu7S4 nanocrystal endowed it more exposed active points, higher surface area and higher Cu/S ratio. Therefore, Cu7S4 nanocrystal was firstly employed to prepare a nonenzymatic biosensor for H2O2. Satisfactory results were obtained. In addition, a label-free sensing platform for prostate specific antigen (PSA) was constructed based on electrochemical catalysis towards H2O2 of Cu7S4 nanocrystal. The label-free immunosenosr offered accurate PSA in the range of 0.001-15 ng/mL with the detection limit of 0.001 ng/mL. Besides, the immunosensor possessed good sensitivity, selectivity and stability and could detect PSA in real sample. More importantly, this work demonstrated that Cu7S4 nanocrystal hold great promising application in electrochemical sensors.

AB Cardiovascular diseases are a major cause of death around the world underlining the importance of efficient treatments including novel medication. In vitro models of cardiac tissues are highly desired for monitoring electrophysiological response to screen pharmaceutical compounds at an early stage. Here, we report a platinum based 3D pillar electrode platform with cell growth guiding channel, which allows integrated, continuous electrical stimulation and recording of the cardiac tissues. This platform was successfully used to culture beating cardiomyocytes over weeks. The Pt-PDMS pillar electrode showed an impedance of 2.5 +/- 0.3 k Omega at 10 Hz that is stable for using in cell cultures at 37 degrees C. Electrically pacing the cells improved maturation of the cardiac tissues. Contraction activities of 3D cardiac tissues were monitored in real-time through the pillar electrodes to evaluate physiological parameters. Adding 100 nM Isoproterenol clearly increased the spontaneous beating rate and decreased the extracellular field potential duration of the microtissues observed with electrical recording through the pillar electrodes. Overall, this platform has a potential to be applied in drug screening for in Sint monitoring the biophysical parameters of the heart tissue in real-time.

AB Electrochemical molecularly imprinted polymers (e-MIPs) were for the first time introduced in screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE) as the sensing element for the detection of an organic pollutant. To play this sensing role, a redox tracer was incorporated inside the binding cavities of a cross-linked MIP, as a functional monomer during the synthesis step. Ferrocenylmethyl methacrylate was used for this purpose. It was associated with 4-vinylpyridine as a co-functional monomer and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as cross-linker for the recognition of the endocrine disruptor, Bisphenol A (BPA), as a target. Microbeads of e-MIP and e-NIP (corresponding non imprinted polymer) were obtained via precipitation polymerization in acetonitrile. The presence of ferrocene inside the polymers was assessed via FTIR and elemental analysis and the polymers microstructure was characterized by SEM and nitrogen adsorption/desorption experiments. Binding isotherms and batch selectivity experiments evidenced the presence of binding cavities inside the e-MIP and its high affinity for BPA compared to carbamazepine and ketoprofen. e-MIP (and e-NIP) microbeads were then incorporated in a graphite-hydroxyethylcellulose composite paste to prepare SPCE. Electrochemical properties of e-MIP-SPCE revealed a high sensitivity in the presence of BPA in aqueous medium compared to e-NIP-SPCE with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.06 nM. Selectivity towards carbamazepine and ketoprofen was also observed with the e-MIP-SPCE.

AB Core/shell hydrogel microcapsules attract increasing research attention due to their potentials in tissue engineering, food engineering, and drug delivery. Current approaches for generating core/shell hydrogel micro capsules suffer from large geometric variations. Geometrically defective core/shell microcapsules need to be removed before further use. High-throughput geometric characterization of such core/shell microcapsules is therefore necessary. In this work, a continuous-flow device was developed to measure the geometric properties of microcapsules with a hydrogel shell and an aqueous core. The microcapsules were pumped through a tapered microchannel patterned with an array of interdigitated microelectrodes. The geometric parameters (the shell thickness and the diameter) were derived from the displacement profiles of the microcapsules. The results show that this approach can successfully distinguish all unencapsulated microparticles. The geometric properties of core/shell microcapsules can be determined with high accuracy. The efficacy of this method was demonstrated through a drug releasing experiment where the optimization of the electrospray process based on geometric screening can lead to controlled and extended drug releasing profiles. This method does not require high-speed optical systems, simplifying the system configuration and making it an indeed miniaturized device. The throughput of up to 584 microcapsules per minute was achieved. This study provides a powerful tool for screening core/shell hydrogel microcapsules and is expected to facilitate the applications of these microcapsules in various fields.

AB Novel mesoporous ZnCo2O4 (meso-ZnCo2O4) nanosheets were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method for detection of o-nitrophenol (ONP) and p-nitrophenol (PNP). The resultant meso-ZnCo2O4 nanosheets possess more catalytic active sites than other structures, which enhance the catalysis properties for the electrochemical detection of nitrophenol. This sensor exhibits a wide linear detection range (1-4000 and 1-4000 mu M) and high sensitivity (0.256 and 0.318 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2)), as well as low detection limit (0.3 and 0.3 mu M), for ONP and PNP, respectively. In addition, the fabricated sensor reveals excellent reproducibility, stability and selectivity.

AB A label-free method for the determination of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was successfully developed by graphene oxide (GO)-based electrochemical aptasensor. This aptasensor was constructed by covalently immobilizing NH2functionalized AFP-specific aptamer on GO with plenty of carboxylic groups. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) analysis were carried out to investigate the practicability of the fabrication procedures. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), Raman, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were performed to indicate the changes of the sensing interface. CV was used to detect the signal change of the aptasensor. Peak current of CVs changed before and after incubating the aptasensor with different concentration of AFP solution. The changes of peak current were proportional to the AFP concentration, with a wide linear range of 0.01-100 ng mL(-1), a low detection limit of 3 pg(-1) and good specificity. The proposed simple and cost-effective label-free strategy is promising for the determination of clinical biomarkers such as AFP.

AB In this work, a sensitive photoelectrochemical aptasensor was developed for kanamycin detection using an enhanced photocurrent response strategy, which is based on the surface plasmon resonance effect of gold nanoparticles deposited on a 3D TiO2-MoS2 flower-like heterostructure. A significant aspect of this development lies in the photoelectrochemical and morphological features of the unique ternary composite, which have contributed to the excellent performance of the sensor. To develop an aptasensor, mercapto-group modified aptamers were immobilised on the photoactive composite as a recognition unit for kanamycin. The TiO2-MoS2AuNP composite was demonstrated to accelerate the electron transfer, increase the loading of aptamers and improve the visible light excitation of the sensor. Under optimal conditions, the aptasensor exhibited a dynamic range from 0.2 nM to 450 nM of kanamycin with a detection limit of 0.05 nM. Overall, we have successfully synergised both the electrical and the optical merits from individual components to form a ternary composite, which was then demonstrated as an effective scaffold for the development of PEC biosensors.

AB It is critically important to detect antibiotic residues for monitoring food safety. In this study, an enzyme- and label-free electrochemical aptasensor for antibiotics, with kanamycin (Kana) as a typical analyte, was developed based on a double stir bar-assisted toehold-mediated strand displacement reaction (dSB-TMSDR) for dual-signal amplification. First, we modified two gold electrodes (E-1 and E-2) with different DNA probes (S1/S2 hybrid probe in E-1 and DNA fuel strand S3 in E-2). In the presence of Kana, an Sl/S2 probe can be disassembled from E-1 to form an S2/Kana complex in supernatant. The S2/Kana could react with S3 on E-2 to form S2/S3 hybrid and release Kana through TMSDR. After then, the target recycling was triggered. Subsequently, the formed S2/S3 hybrid can also trigger a hybridization chain reaction (HCR). Consequently, the dual-signal amplification strategy was established, which resulted in many long dsDNA chains on E-2. The chains can associate with methylene blue (MB) as redox probes to produce a current response for the quantification of Kana. The assay exhibited high sensitivity and specificity with a detection limit at 16 fM Kana due to the dual-signal amplification. The double stir bars system can both increase phase separation and prevent leakage of DNA fuel to reduce background interference. Moreover, it allows flexible sequence design of the TMSDR probes. The assay was successfully employed to detect Kana residues in food and showed potential application value in food safety detection.

AB Rapid and sensitive on-site detection of avian influenza virus (AIV) is the key for achieving near real-time surveillance of AIV and reducing the risk of dissemination. However, unlike the laboratory-prepared transparent buffer solutions containing a single type of influenza virus, distinction between real- and false-positive outputs and detection of low concentrations of AN in stool specimens or cloacal swabs are difficult. Here, we developed a rapid and background-free lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) platform that utilizes near-infrared (NIR)-to-NIR upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) to yield a sensor that detects AIV nucleoproteins (NPs) from clinical samples within 20 min. Ca2+ as a heterogeneous dopant ion in the shell enhanced the NIR-to-NIR upconversion photoluminescence (PL) emission without inducing significant changes in the morphology of the UCNPs. In a mixture of opaque stool samples and gold nanoparticles (GNPs), which are components of commercial AN LFA, the background signal of the stool samples masked the absorption peak of GNPs. However, UCNPs dispersed in the stool samples still show strong emission centered at 800 nm when excited at 980 nm, which enables the NIR-to-NIR upconversion nanoparticle-based lateral flow immunoassay (NNLFA) platform to detect 10-times lower viral load than a commercial GNP-based MV LFA. The detection limit of NNLFA for LPAI H5N2 and HPAI H5N6 viruses was 10(2) and 10(3.5) EID50/mL, respectively. Moreover, the viruses were successfully detected within dark brown-colored samples using the NNLFA but not the commercial AN LFA. Therefore, the rapid and background free NNLFA platform can be used for sensitive on-site detection of MV.

AB In this study, polythiophene copolymers have been used as modifier for electrode surfaces in order to allow the immobilization of active pyrroloquinoline quinone dependent glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ-GDH) and to simultaneously improve the direct electrical connection of the enzyme with the electrode. Polymer films are electrosynthesized in aqueous solution without the need of surfactants onto carbon nanotubes modified gold electrodes from mixtures of 3-thiopheneacetic acid (ThCH2CO2H) and 3-methoxythiophene (ThOCH3) using a potentiostatic pulse method. Polythiophene deposition significantly improves the bioelectrocatalysis of PQQGDH: the process starts at -200 mV vs. Ag/AgCl and allows well-defined glucose detection at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl with high current density. Several parameters of the electro-polymerization method have been evaluated to maximize the anodic current output after enzyme coupling. The polymer deposited by this new procedure has been morphologically and chemically characterized by different methods (SEM, EDX, FT-IR, UV-Vis, XPS and Raman spectroscopy). The bioelectrocatalytic response towards increasing glucose concentrations exhibits a dynamic range extending from 1 mu M to 2 mu M. The low applied potential allows to avoid interferences from easily oxidizable substances such as uric acid and ascorbic acid. Short and long-term stability has been evaluated. Finally, the PQQ-GDH electrode has been coupled to a bilirubin oxidase (BOD)-and carbon nanotube-based cathode in order to test its performance as anode of a biofuel cell. The promising results suggest a further investigation of this kind of polymers and, in particular, the study of the interaction with other enzymes in order to employ them in building up biosensors and biofuel cells.

AB The amalgamation of natural origin materials and technologies for label-free and real time detection is pertinent in analytical field. In this study, Bombyx mori silk fibroin protein (BMSF) has been utilized for the dual sensing of vitamin B-12 via fluorescence and electrical impedance techniques. The processing of BMSF is done to generate an aqueous solution of BMSF along with the development of micro patterned thin films via soft lithography technique. The BMSF aqueous solution exhibit auto fluorescence property and thereby utilized for label free detection of vitamin B-12 with an estimated limit of detection (LOD) of about 0.003 x 10(-6) g/uL. This is followed by impedimetric detection of vitamin 1312 using the micro patterned BMSF thin films. A LOD of 17.8 ppm and 0.25 ppm are achieved in aqueous solution and human blood serum, respectively. Taken together, this work demonstrates a potential label free dual sensing mode for sensitive detection of micronutrient vitamin B-12.

AB A novel electrochemical DNA (E-DNA) biosensing strategy was designed and used for the detection of breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA-1). The biosensor was based on gold nanoparticles-reduced graphene oxide (AuNPs-GO) modified glass carbon electrode (GCE) covered with the layer of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) synthesized with rhodamine B (RhB) as template, methacrylic acid (MAA) as the monomer, and Nafion as additive. The signal amplification tracing tag SiO2@Ag NPs were prepared by covering AgNPs on the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles in situ, and then DNA probes were modified on AgNPs by Ag-S bond, forming the composites SiO2@Ag/DNA. In presence of target DNA (T-DNA), homogeneous hybridization was performed with SiO2@Ag/DNA and RhB labeled DNA, and the resulting SiO2@Ag/dsDNA/RhB was specifically recognized by MIPs via the interaction between imprinting cavities and RhB. Under optimal conditions, the proposed biosensor exhibited wide linear range from 10 fM to 100 nM, low detection limit of 2.53 fM (S/N = 3), excellent selectivity, reproducibility, stability, and feasibility in serum analysis. Overall, these findings suggest the promising prospects of the proposed biosensing strategy in clinical diagnostics.

AB The modification of electrode surfaces has been the target of study for many researchers in order to improve the analytical performance of electrochemical sensors. Herein, the use of an imidazole-functionalized graphene oxide (GO-IMZ) as an artificial enzymatic active site for voltammetric determination of progesterone (P4) is described for the first time. The morphology and electrochemical performance of electrode modified with GOIMZ were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and cyclic voltammetry, respectively. Under optimized conditions, the proposed sensor showed a synergistic effect of the GO sheets and the imidazole groups anchored on its backbone, which promoted a significant enhancement on electrochemical reduction of P4. Figures of merits such as linear dynamic response for P4 concentration ranging from 0.22 to 14.0 mol L-1, limit of detection of 68 nmol L-1 and limit of quantification and 210 nmol L-1 were found. In addition, presented a higher sensitivity, 426 nA L gmol(-1), when compared to the unmodified electrode. Overall, the proposed device showed to be a promising platform for a simple, rapid, and direct analysis of progesterone.

AB Vagus nerve stimulation is an emerging bioelectronic medicine to modulate cardiac function, as the nerve provides parasympathetic innervation to the heart. In this study, we developed a polyimide based 2D cuff electrode to wrap around on the vagus nerve. Thanks to the tiny size and bendable protruding structure of the contact tips of the device, the electrode sites are able to flexibly bend to touch the nerve, selectively record and stimulate the vagus nerve. Gold, platinum and platinum black materials were chosen to compose the electrodes for nerve stimulation and recording, respectively. Since the platinum black has similar to 30 times larger charge delivery capacity (CDC) than gold, Pt black electrode is used for nerve stimulation. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurement of the three materials were conducted in vitro, revealing the results of 405 k Omega, 41 k Omega, 10.5 k Omega, @1 kHz and 0.81 mC/cm(2), 4.26 mC/cm(2), 25.5 mC/cm(2), respectively (n = 3). The cuff electrodes were implanted into the right-sided vagus nerve of rats for in vivo experiment. Biphasic current configuration was implemented for nerve stimulation with frequency of 10 Hz, pulse during of 300 is and various currents stimulus. The result shows the heart beat frequency drops up to 36% during the stimulation and was able to return the regular frequency as stimulation was removed. Subsequently, the vagus nerve signals were recorded with the four channel cuff electrodes. The magnitude of the compound nerve action potentials (CNAPs) is 10 V and the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is similar to 20.

AB The discovery of discriminating molecular biomarkers often couples omits for data acquisition with advanced information processing methods for data analysis. Here, we move information processing upstream for data acquisition and report that a samples "chemical space" can be actively probed using a tailored sequence of redox-based input signals. Specifically, we use a redox-active iridium salt (K3IrCl6) and an oxidative pulse-redoxrelaxation input sequence to probe serum samples for chemical information. Optical and electrical output responses are collected simultaneously and analyzed using signal metrics that are sensitive to component and concentration dependent chemical information. We use the example of schizophrenia to illustrate the potential of this signal processing approach to rapidly discover discriminating signatures using simple and inexpensive instrumentation. These studies indicate that redox-probing provides an orthogonal measurement approach to accelerate biomarker discovery and further suggest a simple means to supply chemical information for the internet-of-things in medical and consumer applications.

AB In the study, a novel sensing strategy based on dual-probe mode, which involved two groups of 2'-fluoro ribonucleic acid (2'-F RNA) modified probes, was designed for the detection of synthetic target double-strand DNA (dsDNA) of PML/RAR alpha fusion genes in APL. And each pair of probes contained a thiolated capture probe (Cl or C2) immobilized on one of electrode surfaces in the dual-channel electrochemical biosensor and a biotinylated reporter probe (R1 or R2). The two groups of 2'-F RNA modified probes were separately complementary with the corresponding strand (Sa or Sb) from target dsDNA in order to prevent renaturation of target dsDNA. Through flanking target dsDNA, two "sandwitch" complexes (C1/Sa/R1 and C2/Sb/R2) were separately shaped by capture probes (Cl and C2) and free reporter probes (R1 and R2) in hybridization solution on the surfaces of different electrodes after the thermal denaturation. The biotin-modified enzyme which produced the measurable electrochemical current signal was localized to the surface by affinity binding between biotin with streptavidin. Under the optimal condition, the biosensor was able to detect 84 fM target dsDNA and showed a good specificity in PBS hybridization solution. Otherwise, the investigations of the specificity and sensitivity of the biosensor were carried out further in the mixed hybridization solution containing different kinds of mismatch sequences as interference background. It can be seen that under a certain interference background, the method still exhibited excellent selectivity and specificity for the discrimination between the fully-complementary and the mismatch sequences. The results of our research laid a good basis of further detection research in practical samples.

AB Utilization of traditional analytical techniques is limited because they are generally time-consuming and require high consumption of reagents, complicated sample preparation and expensive equipment. Therefore, it is of great interest to achieve sensitive, rapid and simple detection methods. It is believed that nucleic acids assays, especially aptamers, are very important in modern life sciences for target detection and biological analysis. Aptamers and DNA-based sensors have been widely used for the design of various sensors owing to their unique features. In recent years, triple-helix molecular switch (THMS)-based aptasensors and DNA sensors have been broadly utilized for the detection and analysis of different targets. The THMS relies on the formation of DNA triplex via Watson Crick and Hoogsteen base pairings under optimal conditions. This review focuses on recent progresses in the development and applications of electrochemical, colorimetric, fluorescence and SERS aptasensors and DNA sensors, which are based on THMS. Also, the advantages and drawbacks of these methods are discussed.

AB Herein, we prepared a novel quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor for synthetic cannabinoids (JWH-073, JWH-073 butanoic acid, JWH-018 and JWH-018 pentanoic acid,) detection. Firstly, the synthetic cannabinoid (SCs) imprinted (MIP) and non-imprinted (NIP) nanoparticles were synthesized by mini-emulsion polymerization system. The SCs-imprinted nanoparticles were first characterized by SEM, TEM, zeta-size and FTIR-ATR analysis and then were dropped onto the gold QCM surface. The SCs-imprinted QCM sensor was characterized by an ellipsometer, contact angle, and AFM. The limit of detection was found as 0.3, 0.45, 0.4, 0.2 pg/mL JWH-018, JWH-073, JWH-018 pentanoic acid and JWH-073 butanoic acid, respectively. The selectivity of the SCs-imprinted QCM sensor was shown by using JWH-018, JWH-018 pentanoic acid, TN/H-073 and JWH-073 butanoic acid. According to the results, the SCs-imprinted QCM sensors show highly selective and sensitive in a broad range of synthetic cannabinoid concentrations (0.0005-1.0 ng/mL) in both aqueous and synthetic urine solutions.

AB Long-duration space missions pose important health concerns for astronauts, especially regarding the adverse effects of microgravity and exposure to high-energy cosmic rays. The long-term maintenance of crew health and performance mainly relies on prevention, early diagnoses, condition management, and medical interventions in situ. In-flight biosensor diagnostic devices and medical procedures must use few resources and operate in a microgravity environment, which complicates the collection and management of biological samples. Moreover, the biosensors must be certified for in-flight operation according to strict design and safety regulations.
   Herein, we report on the state of the art and recent advances in biosensing diagnostic instrumentation for monitoring astronauts' health during long-duration space missions, including portable and wearable biosensors. We discuss perspectives on new-format biosensors in autonomous space clinics. We also describe our own work in developing biosensing devices for non-invasively diagnosing space-related diseases, and how they are used in long-duration missions. Finally, we discuss the benefits of space exploration for Earth-based medicine.

AB In this study, a novel electrochemical immunosensor for early screening of depression markers-heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) was successfully developed based on the porous graphene (PG) with huge specific surface area and excellent structure. Benefiting from the strong adsorption and good bioactivity of PG which was initially prepared via a simple pyrolysis process, a variety of heat shock protein70 (HSP70) can be firmly loaded on the PG to construct the basic electrode (HSP70/PG/GCE), which was characterized by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), respectively. Due to the HSP70 fixed on the surface of basic electrode and the HSP70 in the samples can competitively combine with the horseradish peroxidase labeled human HSP 70 antibody (HRP-Strept-Biotin-Ab). As a result, it presented a negative correlation between the concentration of HSP70 in samples and the detection signal of the proposed electrochemical immunosensor (HRP-Strept-Biotin-Ab-HSP70/PG/GCE) in the test liquid. The application of PG with excellent electrical conductivity in construction of immunosensor remarkably improved the sensitivity of the immunosensor for detection of HSP70. The proposed immunosensor demonstrated a wide linear range of 0.0448 similar to 100 ng/mL with a low detection limit of 0.02 ng/mL at 3 sigma. Moreover, the proposed immunosensor could be applied for the sensitive and efficient detection of HSP70 in real samples with good precision, acceptable stability, reproducibility and satisfactory results. Therefore, the HSP70 immunosensor provides a novel and convenient method for early clinical screening of depression markers-heat shock protein 70.

AB A novel plasmon aided non-enzymatic glucose sensor was first constructed based on the unique half-rough Au/NiAu multilayered nanowire arrays. These multilayered and half-rough nanowires provide high chemical activity and large surface area for glucose oxidation in an alkaline solution. Under visible light irradiation, the surface plasmons originated from Au part enhance the electron transfer in the vertically aligned nanowires, leading to high sensitivity and wide detection range. The resulting sensor exhibits a wide glucose detection concentration range, low detection limit, and high sensitivity for plasmon aided non-enzymatic glucose sensor. Moreover, the detection sensitivity is enhanced by almost 2 folds compared to that in the dark, which significantly enhanced the performance of Au/NiAu multilayered nanowire arrays sensor. An excellent selectivity and acceptable stability were also achieved. These results indicate that surface plasmon aided nanostructures are promising new platforms for the construction of non-enzymatic glucose sensors.

AB Herein, well-defined hollow dendritic AuPtAg alloyed nanocrystals (ANCs) were synthesized by a simple L-proline-mediated one-pot aqueous method. More importantly, the synthesized hollow dendritic architectures provide a suitable platform for immobilization of anti-prostate specific antigen (PSA). The resultant label-free immunosensor exhibited the improved performance for highly sensitive detection of PSA based on the enhanced catalytic currents of K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] as a signal probe. Impressively, the immunosensor showed the wide linear range of 0.05-50 ng mL(-1) and low detection limit of 0.017 ng mL(-1) under optimal conditions for the assay of PSA, couple with the improved stability, reproducibility and selectivity.

AB The fast and efficient detection of foodbome pathogens is a societal priority, given the large number of food poisoning outbreaks, and a scientific and technological challenge, given the need to detect as little as 1 viable cell in 25 gr of food. Here, we present the first approach that achieves the above goal, thanks to the use of a micro/nano-technology and the detection capability of acoustic wave sensors. Starting from 1 Salmonella cell in 25 ml of milk, we employ immuno-magnetic beads to capture cells after only 3 h of pre-enrichment and subsequently demonstrate efficient DNA amplification using the Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification method (LAMP) and acoustic detection in an integrated platform, within an additional 1/2 h. The demonstrated 4 h sample-to-analysis time comes as a huge improvement to the current need of few days to obtain the same result. In addition, the work presents the first reported Lab-on-Chip platform that comprises an acoustic device as the sensing element, exhibiting impressive analytical features, namely, an acoustic limit of detection of 2 cells/mu l or 3 aM of the DNA target and ability to detect in a label-free manner dsDNA amplicons in impure samples. The use of food samples together with the incorporation of the necessary pre-enrichment step and ability for multiple analysis with an internal control, make the proposed methodology highly relevant to real-world applications. Moreover, the work suggests that acoustic wave devices can be used as an attractive alternative to electro-chemical sensors in integrated platforms for applications in food safety and the point-of-care diagnostics.

AB It is very difficult to predict some complications after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), despite rapid advances in medical science. Herein, we introduce a label-free cellulose surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) biosensor chip with pH-functionalized, gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-enhanced localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects for identification of SAH-induced cerebral vasospasm and hydrocephalus caused by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The SERS biosensor chip was implemented by the synthesis reaction of the AuNPs, which were charged positively through pH level adjustment, onto a negatively-charged cellulose substrate with xi= -30.7 mV. The zeta potential, nanostructural properties, nanocrystallinity, and computational calculation based electric field distributions of the cellulose-originated AuNPs were optimized to maximize LSPR phenomena and then characterized. Additionally, the performance of the SERS biosensor was compared under two representative excitation laser sources in the visible region (532 run) and near-infrared region (785 nm). The Raman activities of our SERS biosensor chip were evaluated by trace small molecules (crystal violet, 2 mu L), and the biosensor achieved an enhancement factor of 3.29 x 10(9) for the analytic concept with an excellent reproducibility of 8.5% relative standard deviation and a detection limit of 0.74 pM. Furthermore, the experimental results revealed that the five proposed SEES-based biomarkers could provide important information for identifying and predicting SAH-induced cerebral vasospasm and hydrocephalus complications (91.1% reliability and 19.3% reproducibility). Therefore, this facile and effective principle of our SERS biosensor chip may inspire the basis and strategies for the development of sensing platforms to predict critical complications in various neurosurgical diagnoses.

AB As a broad-spectrum antibiotic, tetracycline (TC) is widely used in agricultural purposes and human therapy. More attention is paid to TC as a serious threat to human health, including the fast spreading of antibiotic resistance gene and the serious toxicity to aquatic organisms. Therefore, the timely and accurate determination of TC residues is an urgent task to protect the safety of human. Herein, an effective and facile photoelectrochemical sensor platform based on carbon nitride/bismuth oxyhalide (CN/BiOBr) composites can be constructed for monitoring TC. The flower-like CN/BiOBr composites are prepared via a simple one-pot ethylene glycol-assisted solvothermal process with the addition of ionic liquid 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([C(16)mim]Br). In view of matched energy band positions of CN and BiOBr, the addition of CN can reduce the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and improve the efficiency of visible light utilization, leading to enhancing photoelectrochemical response of BiOBr. Under light excitation, the photocurrent of CN/BiOBr composites is drastically improved, which is 6 times as much as that of pure BiOBr. Considering the superior photoelectrochemical performance, a photoelectrochemical sensor for monitoring TC has been developed, displaying linearly enhanced photocurrent with increasing the TC concentration. Two linear relationships received are from 8.0 to 4.0 x 10(2) ng mL(-1), and 4.0 x 10(2) to 5.2 x 10(3) ng mL(-1), respectively. The detection limit is 3.8 ng mL(-1). The photoelectrochemical sensor exhibits a series of benefits including excellent stability, a wide linear range, a low detection limit and good anti-interference ability. Therefore, this work may offer great promises in providing a universal and efficient photoelectrochemical sensor for the tetracycline detection, and pave the way of constructing more materials used in photoelectrochemical detection field.

AB Double layered one-by-one imprinted hollow core-shells@pencil graphite electrode was fabricated for sequential sensing of anti-HIV drugs. For this, two eccentric layers were developed on the surface of vinylated silica nanospheres to obtain double layered one-by-one imprinted solid core-shells. This yielded hollow core shells on treatment with hydrofluoric acid. The modified hollow core-shells (single layered dual imprinted) evolved competitive diffusion of probe/analyte molecules. However, the corresponding double layered one-by one imprinted hollow core-shells (outer layer imprinted with Zidovudine, and inner layer with Lamivudine) were found relatively better owing to their bilateral diffusions into molecular cavities, without any competition. The entire work is based on differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry at double layered one-by-one imprinted hollow core-shells. This resulted in indirect detection of electro inactive targets with limits of detection as low as 0.91 and 0.12 (aqueous sample), 0.94 and 0.13 (blood serum), and 0.99 and 0.20 ng mL(-1) (pharmaceutics) for lamivudine and zidovudine, respectively in anti-HIV drug combination.

AB A real-time quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) cytosensor based on a signal recovery strategy was first developed for in-situ and continuous monitoring of multiple cell membrane glycoproteins. In this work, gold nano particles (AuNPs) were linked with ligands to fabricate ligand-functionalized mass nanoprobes with signal amplification for increasing monitoring sensitivity. The mass nanoprobes bound to cell surface could be eluted with glycine-hydrochloric acid buffer, which led to a quick recovery of resonance frequency. Using the strategy, folate receptors (FR), CD44 molecule and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on cell membrane as the models were monitored continuously. The quantification result of MDA-MB-231 cells showed a range of linearity of 3.0 x 10(4) to 1.0 x 10(6) cells and a detection limit of 5.0 x 10(3) cells. Furthermore, the multianalyte cytosensor exhibited three sensitive and recoverable frequency shifts during continuous monitoring for in-situ and continuous evaluation of the expression levels of FR, CD44 and EGFR on cell membrane, which exhibited that the average numbers of molecules of FR, CD44 and EGFR per MDA-MB-231 cell were 0.5 x 10(6), 0.2 x 10(6) and 1.4 x 10(5) with the relative standard deviation of 4.8%, 4.5% and 5.1%, respectively. Compared with monolithic multichannel QCM, the multianalyte cytosensor based on a single microbalance could not only exclude acoustic interference but also reduce instrumental cost. This work provided a simple and efficient QCM cytosensor for in situ and continuous monitoring of multiple cell membrane glycoproteins that offered a new avenue for early diagnosis of cancer.

AB This study employed an open external circuit, rather than a closed circuit applied in previous studies, to operate an microbial fuel cell (MFC) sensor for real-time nitrate monitoring, and achieved surprisingly greater sensitivity (4.42 +/- 0.3-6.66 +/- 0.4 mV/(mg/L)) when the nitrate was at a concentration of 10-40 mg/L, compared to that of the MFC sensor with a closed circuit (0.8 +/- 0.05-1.6 +/- 0.1 mV/(mg/L)). The MFC sensor operated in open circuit (O-MFC sensor) delivered much more stable performance than that operated in closed circuit (C-MFC sensor) when affected by organic matter (NaAc). The sensitivity of O-MFC sensor was twice that of C-MFC sensor at a low background concentration of organic matter. When organic matter reached a high concentration, the sensitivity of O-MFC sensor remained at an acceptable level, while that of C-MFC sensor dropped to almost zero. Challenged by a combined shock of organic matter and nitrate, O-MFC sensor delivered evident electrical signals for nitrate warning, while C-MFC failed. Another novel feature of this study lies in a new mathematical model to examine the bioanode process of nitrate monitoring. It revealed that lower capacitance of the bioanode in O-MFC was the major contributor to the improved sensitivity of the device.

AB Fluorescence-based biosensor platforms have been intensively investigated not only to increase the sensitivity but also to improve the performance of biosensors. By exploiting metal from the macroscopic down to the nanoscopic surface, various architectures have been devised to manipulate fluorescence signals (enhancement, quenching) within near-optical fields. The interaction of a metallic surface with proximal fluorophores (in the range of 5-90 nm) has beneficial effects on optical properties such as an increased quantum yield, improved photostability and a reduced lifetime of fluorophores. This phenomenon called metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF) has been extensively used in biosensory applications. However, their applications for biological analysis practically remain challenging in biological microenvironments. Therefore, this review primarily provides a general overview of MEF biosensor systems from the basic mechanism to state-of-the-art biological applications. The review also covers the pros and cons of MEF biosensor as well as discussions about further directions in biological perspectives.

AB Graphene is widely recognized as a promising nanomaterial for the construction of high-performance electro-chemical biosensors. However, the lack of strong interfacial forces between graphene and conductive substrates is a bottleneck in the fabrication of highly stable graphene electrodes. In this work, few-layer graphene was directly formed on a high pressure high temperature (HPHT) diamond substrate via sp(3)-to-sp(2) conversion by catalytic thermal treatment and using diamond itself as the carbon source. The hybrid electrode prototype was also highly conductive and had a linear electrochemical response to dopamine in the concentration range of 5 mu M - 2 mM, with a low detection limit of 200 nM. After prolonged and repeated exposure to dopamine, electrode fouling was observed which led to sensitivity degradation. Based on the strong interfacial bonding between graphene and HPHT diamond, regeneration of the fouled electrode and full performance recovery would be easily achieved by ultrasonic cleaning. The hybrid electrode is highly robust, and shows potential in its application to the detection of biofouling molecules, food processing and wastewater treatment.

AB Superwettable microchips with superhydrophilic microwells on superhydrophobic substrate have attracted increasing attention in fluorescence-based biological and medical diagnostics. However, traditional fluorophores often suffer from the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) problem at high concentration or in aggregated state. Here, we developed an AIE-based superwettable microchip by combining the evaporation-induced enrichment of superwettable microchips and the aggregation-induced emission of AlEgens together into one chip. Benefitting from the synergistic effect of the above two mechanisms, the AIE molecules (TPE-Z, a tetraphenylethene salt) were enriched from the diluted solution via evaporation and aggregated within the superhydrophilic microwell and then realized the fluorescence enhancement. Based on the dual enhancement effect of the ATE-based superwettable microchip, microRNA-141 (miR-141) can be detected with excellent reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity. A low detection limit of 1 pM can be achieved with higher signal-to-noise ratio than the traditional fluorescent probes. The proposed AIE-based superwettable microchip will provide a simple fluorescence enhancement biosensing platform for rapid, multiplexed and high-throughput analysis of specific targets in environmental monitoring, food safety, medical diagnosis and related research areas.

AB It is fundamental to develop highly efficient visible light-responsive photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance material for fabricating PEC biosensor. Herein, BiPO4/three-dimensional nitrogen doped graphene hydrogel (3DNGH) nanocomposites were prepared for the first time via a facile one-pot hydrothermal route. In this nanoarchitecture, the BiPO4 nanorods were anchored onto the porous structure of 3DNGH. Compared with pristine BiPO4, the absorption of BiPO4/3DNGH has been extend to visible-light region, and the energy band gap of BiPO4/3DNGH was calculated to be 2.10 eV, which was greatly narrower than that of pristine BiPO4 with a band gap of 3.85 eV. Under visible light irradiation, the photocurrent signal of the as-prepared BiPO4/3DNGH was 847.2-fold, 4.1-fold and 2.3-fold enhanced comparing to pristine BiPO4, BiPO4 functionalized reduced graphene oxide and BiPO4/nitrogen doped graphene. The enhancement of such photocurrent signal was attributed to the introduction of 3DNGH, which was capable to improve the charge transfer rate and also the efficiency of visible-light utilization of BiPO4. Based on the excellent PEC properties of BiPO4/3DNGH, a label free PEC aptasensor for selectivity and sensitivity detection of tetracycline (Tc) was successfully established by using Tc aptamer as a biorecognition element. Under optimized conditions, the proposed PEC aptasensor exhibited a wide linear in the range from 0.1 nmol L-1 to 1 mu mol L-1 as well as a low detection limit of 0.033 nmol L (S/N = 3). The prepared BiPO4/3DNGH nanocomposites would serve as a promising visible light-responsive photoactive material for fabrication of PEC biosensors with high performance.

AB We are reporting a novel biosensing platform based on a hybrid nanomaterial that combines the advantages of Nafion-coated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and mesoporous silica MCM41 nanoparticles functionalized with hemoglobin (Hb). MWCNTs-MCM41-Hb hybrid bioconjugate was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-vis spectroscopy and electrochemical techniques after deposition at glassy carbon electrodes (GCE). The combination of the high surface area, biocompatibility and protein loading capacity of MCM41 nanoparticles and the high surface area and catalytic properties of MWCNTs allowed the direct electron transfer (DET) between Hb and the electrode surface. The electron transfer rate constant (k) and the surface coverage of electroactive Hb (Gamma(Hb)) were 5.2 s(-1) and 4.7 x 10(-10) mol cm(-2), respectively. The GCE modified with the nanostructured architecture (GCE/MWCNTs-MCM41-Hb) was successfully used as a third-generation biosensor for the highly sensitive and selective quantification of nitrite (NO2-) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) by taking advantage of the excellent biocatalytic activity of Hb and the efficient direct charge transfer of the heme group.

AB Microarray technology to isolate living cells using external fields is a facile way to do phenotypic analysis at the cellular level. We have used alternating current dielectrophoresis (AC-DEP) to drive the assembly of live pathogenic Salmonella typhi (S.typhi) and Escherichia coli (E.coli) bacteria into miniaturized single cell micro arrays. The effects of voltage and frequency were optimized to identify the conditions for maximum cell capture which gave an entrapment efficiency of 90% in 60 min. The chip was used for calibration-free estimation of cellular loads in binary mixtures and further applied for rapid and enhanced testing of cell viability in the presence of drug via impedance spectroscopy. Our results using a model antimicrobial sushi peptide showed that the cell viability could be tested down to 5 mu g/mL drug concentration under an hour, thus establishing the utility of our system for ultrafast and sensitive detection.

AB We fabricated a fourth generation glucose biosensor using CeO2@CuO core shell nano structure (CeCCS NSs). A simple leave extract of Ocimum tenuiflorum was used to prepare different wt% of 0.2, 04, 0.6, and 0.8 CuO (shell), above 1 wt% of CeO2 (core). The successful formation was confirmed by various characterization techniques like XRD, UvVis, FTIR, SEM and HR-TEM. In the biosensor, 0.4 wt% of CeCCS NSs has shown efficient properties due to its high surface area. The good conductivity and high catalytic activity towards glucose sensing properties were estimated by screen-printed electrode (SPE). The ampherometric studies of CeCCS/SPE modified electrode have been optimized at potential + 0.4 V, showed a sensitivity of 3319.83 mu Am M-1 cm(-2) within detection limit of 0.019 mu M. More significantly, modified electrodes performed excellently against anti-interference and anti-poisoned activity in glucose sample and exhibited promising results for the sustainable improvement for non-enzymatic sensing applications.

AB A novel carbon nanocomposite paste electrode was prepared and used as a voltammetric sensor for ultratrace determination of trimipramine (TRI) which currently used for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. For this aim, nanoparticles of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP), synthesized by precipitation polymerization method, and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were embedded in a nanocomposite paste electrode. The nanocomposite mixing style demonstrated a significant influence on the final electrode performance. The sensor exhibited linear response range of 1.0 x 10(-10)-2.5 x 10(-8) mol L-1 and very high sensitivity of 2131 mu A mu mol L-1. The lower detection limit of the sensor was calculated to be 4.5 x 10(-11) mol L-1 (S/N = 3). This sensor was applied successfully for highly selective determination of TRI in pharmaceutical formulations, urine and serum samples without applying any sample pretreatment.

AB Diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms including bacteria and viruses can cause serious medical issues including death and result in huge economic losses. Despite the myriad of recent advances in the rapid and accurate detection of pathogens, large volume clinical samples with a low concentration of pathogens continue to present challenges for diagnosis and surveillance. We here report a simple and label-free approach via homobifunctional imidoesters (HIs) with a microfluidic platform (SLIM) to efficiently enrich and extract pathogens at low concentrations from clinical samples. The SLIM system consists of an assembled double micro fluidic chip for streamlining large volume processing and HIs for capturing pathogens and isolating nucleic acids by both electrostatic and covalent interaction without a chaotropic detergent or bulky instruments. The SLIM system significantly increases the enrichment and extraction rate of pathogens (up to 80% at 10 CFU (colony forming unit) in a 1 mL volume within 50 min). We demonstrated its clinical utility in large sample volumes from 46 clinical specimens including environmental swabs, saliva, and blood plasma. The SLIM system showed higher sensitivity with these samples and could detect pathogens that were below the threshold of detection with other methods. Finally, by combining our SLIM approach with an isothermal optical sensor, pathogens could be detected at a very high sensitivity in blood plasma samples within 80 min via enrichment, extraction and detection steps. Our SLIM system thus provides a simple, reliable, cost-effective and ultrasensitive pathogen diagnosis platform for use with large volume clinical samples and would thus have significant utility for various infectious diseases.

AB This paper presents a new microfluidic impedance cytometry with crossing constriction microchannels, enabling the characterization of cellular electrical markers (e.g., specific membrane capacitance (C-sm) and cytoplasm conductivity (sigma(cy))) in large cell populations (similar to 100,000 cells) at a rate greater than 100 cells/s. Single cells were aspirated continuously through the major constriction channel with a proper sealing of the side constriction channel. An equivalent circuit model was developed and the measured impedance values were translated to C-sm and sigma(cy). Neural network was used to classify different cell populations where classification success rates were calculated. To evaluate the developed technique, different tumour cell lines, and the effects of epithelial-mesenchymal transitions on tumour cells were examined. Significant differences in both C-sm and sigma(cy), were found for H1299 and HeLa cell lines with a classification success rate of 90.9% in combination of the two parameters. Meanwhile, tumour cells A549 showed significant decreases in both C-sm and sigma(cy) after epithelial-mesenchymal transitions with a classification success rate of 76.5%. As a high-throughput microfluidic impedance cytometry, this technique can add a new marker-free dimension to flow cytometry in single-cell analysis.

AB Rapid detection techniques of pathogenic bacteria in the liquid food supply chain are of significant research interest due to their pivotal role in preventing foodbome outbreaks, and in maintaining high standards of public health and safety. Milk and dairy products are of particular interest due to their widespread consumption across the globe. In this paper, a biosensor for detecting pathogenic bacteria in milk using dextrin-capped gold nanoparticles (d-AuNP) as labels decoded at microwave frequencies is presented. The SPEL (sensing pathogens electrically in liquids) biosensor consists of a 3D printed vial and uses an RF reader and an RFID (radio-frequency identification) compatible Split Ring Resonator (SRR) based tag. The SPEL biosensor is capable of detecting bacteria at 5 log CFU/mL within 75 min, with the possibility of testing multiple concurrent samples. Detection is based on impedance loading of SRR by d-AuNP bound to pathogenic bacteria. Spectrophotometry, along with carbohydrate-functionalized magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) cell capture, is used to verify the sensitivity of the SPEL biosensor with respect to d-AuNP presence. The proof-of-concept device, along with challenges and opportunities for commercialization, are also outlined.

AB Prevention of life threatening hypersensitivity reactions to carbamazepine is possible through pre-treatment screening of the associated HLA-B*15:02 risk allele. However, clinical implementation of screening is hindered by the high cost and slow turnaround of conventional HLA typing methods. We have developed an interdigitated electrode (IDE) biosensor platform utilizing loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) that can rapidly detect the HLA-B*15:02 allele. DNA amplification is followed by solid-phase hybridization of LAMP amplicons to a DNA probe immobilized on the IDE sensor surface, resulting in a change in sensor impedance. The testing platform does not require DNA extraction or post-amplification staining, achieving sample-to-answer in 1 h and 20 min. The platform was tested on 27 whole blood samples (14 HLA-B*15:02 positive and 13 negative) with sensitivity of 92.9% and specificity of 84.6% when applying a cutoff of impedance change. Based on these characters the LAMP-IDE platform has potential to be further developed into point-of-care use to help overcome barriers in HLA-B*15:02 screening.

AB Inspired by the photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of TiO2 nanotubes arrays (TNA) and their application as a super vessel for immobilizing biomolecules, we constructed an inhibition-effect PEC biosensor for determination of asulam based on the in-situ generation of CdS quantum dots (QDs) on TNA using an enzymatic reaction. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme was covalently assembled on the inner-wall of TNAs, which exhibited good electrochemical and catalytic properties. In the mixture solution containing H2O2, CdY and S2O32-, HRP enzyme in TNAs catalyzed H2O2 reduce S2O32- to S2-. The generated S2- reacted with CdY to form CdS QDs in situ on the TNAs, improving the PEC performance of TNA under visible light irradiation. The photocurrent would decrease after addition of asulam due to its inhibitory effect towards HRP enzyme activity. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the constructed PEC TNA/HRP biosensor exhibited a satisfying linear range (0.02-2.0 ng mL(-1)), low limit of detection (4.1 pg mL(-1)) and good selectivity towards asulam determination, and has been successfully applied for the analysis of real environmental water samples with good accuracy of the recoveries ranged from 90% to 114%.

AB Enzyme-mimicking catalytic nanoparticles, more commonly known as NanoZymes, have been at the forefront for the development of new sensing platforms for the detection of a range of molecules. Although solution-based NanoZymes have shown promise in glucose detection, the ability to immobilize NanoZymes on highly absorbent surfaces, particularly on free-standing substrates that can be feasibly exposed and removed from the reaction medium, can offer significant benefits for a range of biosensing and catalysis applications. This work, for the first time, shows the ability of Ag nanoparticles embedded within the 3D matrix of a cotton fabric to act as a free-standing peroxidase-mimic NanoZyme for the rapid detection of glucose in complex biological fluids such as urine. The use of cotton fabric as a template not only allows high number of catalytically active sites to participate in the enzyme-mimic catalytic reaction, the absorbent property of the cotton fibres also helps in rapid absorption of biological molecules such as glucose during the sensing event. This, in turn, brings the target molecule of interest in close proximity of the NanoZyme catalyst enabling accurate detection of glucose in urine. Additionally, the ability to extract the free-standing cotton fabric-supported NanoZyme following the reaction overcomes the issue of potential interference from colloidal nanoparticles during the assay. Based on these unique characteristics, nanostructured silver fabrics offer remarkable promise for the detection of glucose and other biomolecules in complex biological and environmental fluids.

AB Contamination of surface and drinking water due to the presence of Escherichia coli bacteria is a major cause of water-borne disease outbreak. To address unmet challenges for practical pathogen detection in contaminated samples, we report fabrication of thermally reduced graphene oxide-based field-effect transistor (rGO FET) passivated with an ultrathin layer of Al2O3 for real-time detection of E. coli bacteria. The sensor could detect a single E. coli cell within 50 s in a 1 mu L sample volume. The ultrathin layer of Al2O3 acted as a barrier between rGO and potential interferents present in the sample. E. coli specific antibodies anchored on gold nanoparticles acted as probes for selective capture of E. coli. The high density of negative charge on the surface of E. coli cells strongly modulates the concentration of majority charge carriers in the rGO monolayer, thereby allowing real-time monitoring of E. coli concentration in a given sample. With a low detection limit of single cell, the FET sensor had a linear range of 1-100 CFU in 1 mu L volume of sample (i.e., 10(3) to 10(5) CFU/mL). The biosensor with good selectivity and rapid detection was further successfully demonstrated for E. coli sensing in river water. The rGO-based FET sensor provides a low cost and label-free approach, and can be mass produced for detection of a broad spectrum of pathogens in water or other liquid media.

AB Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of vascular formation and a predominant protein biomarker in cancer angiogenesis. Owing to its crucial roles in the cancer metastasis, VEGF detection and quantification is of great importance in clinical diagnostics. Today, there exist a wide variety of detection strategies for identifying many types of disease biomarkers, especially for VEGF. As artificial single-stranded DNA or RNA oligonucleotides with catalytic and receptor properties, aptamers have drawn lots of attention to be applied in biosensing platforms due to their target-induced conformational changes as well as high stability and target versatility. So far, various sensitivity-enhancement techniques in combination with a broad range of smart nanomaterials have integrated into the design of novel aptasensors to improve detection limit and sensitivity of analyte detection. This review article provides a brief classification and description of the research progresses of aptamer-based biosensors and nanobiosensors for the detection and quantitative determination of VEGF based on optical and electrochemical platforms.

AB A minimally invasive glucose microbiosensor based the flexibly integrated electrode for continuous monitoring glucose in vivo has been developed in this study. This was achieved by coating needle-type microelectrode with Cu nanoflowers, nafion, glucose oxidase (GOD) and polyurethane (PU) membranes, successfully prepared with layer-by-layer deposition. The Cu nanomaterials provided a large specific surface area and electrocatalytic activity for glucose detection. The PU layers as mass-transport limiting membranes significantly enhanced the linearity and stability of sensors. The resulting biosensor exhibited a wide linear range of 020 mM, with a good sensitivity of 42.38 nA mM(-1) (correlation coefficient r(2) was 0.99) and a fast response time of less than 15 s. In vivo implantable experiments using anesthetized rats showed excellent real-time response to the variation of blood glucose concentration. And the variation tendency of sensor output was consistent with that using the glucose meter. Overall, the results supported the suitability of this microsensor for measuring rapid changes of glucose in vivo. This work offers a promising approach in implantable device applications related to diabetes management as well as other medical diagnosis.

AB Protein kinases play a pivotal role in cellular regulation and signal transduction, the detection of protein kinase activity and inhibition is therefore of great importance to clinical diagnosis and drug discovery. In this work, a novel electrochemical platform using the electrochemically mediated polymerization as an efficient and cost-effective signal amplification strategy is described for the highly sensitive detection of protein kinase activity. This platform involves 1) the phosphorylation of substrate peptide by protein kinase, 2) the attachment of alkyl halide to the phosphorylated sites via the carboxylate-Zr4+-phosphate chemistry, and 3) the in situ grafting of electroactive polymers from the phosphorylated sites through the electrochemically mediated atom transfer radical polymerization (eATRP) at a negative potential, in the presence of the surface-attached alkyl halide as the initiator and the electroactive tag-conjugated acrylate as the monomer, respectively. Due to the electrochemically mediated polymerization, a large number of electroactive tags can be linked to each phosphorylated site, thereby greatly improving the detection sensitivity. This platform has been successfully applied to detect the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) with a detection limit down to 1.63 mU mL(-1). Results also demonstrate that it is highly selective and can be used for the screening of protein kinase inhibitors. The potential application of our platform for protein kinase activity detection in complex biological samples has been further verified using normal human serum and HepG2 cell lysate. Moreover, our platform is operationally simple, highly efficient and cost-effective, thus holding great potential in protein kinase detection and inhibitor screening.

AB A microfluidic paper-based analytical device (mu PAD) was simply constructed for highly sensitive detection of L-glutamic acid and L-cysteine. The mu PAD featured with two functional zones on one strip of paper achieved by preferable multi-plate ZnO nanoflowers (ZnO NFs) and molecularly imprinting polymer (MIP) membranes. The as-designed mu PAD was established based on the inherent relation between the photo-oxidation products and photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance with the highly sensitive detection of biomolecules. The ZnO NFs were utilized to produce photo-oxidation products by driving the reaction between ferrocenemethanol and photogenerated holes under ultraviolet light. The photo-oxidation products easily flowed to MIP membranes along the hydrophilic channel via capillary action. MIP membranes as the receptors specifically recognized the analytes as well as decreased the electron loss by blocking the reduction reaction between electrons and photo-oxidation products. The PEC response was obtained in the processes of electrons transfer and exhibited the direct relationships corresponding to the concentrations of target analytes. The mu PAD showed the detection limits toward L-glutamic acid and L-cysteine as low as 9.6 pM and 24 pM, respectively. Moreover, it is interesting to point out that ZnO NFs nanostructure shows superior PEC signal compared with those of ZnO nanospheres, nanosheets, and nanorod arrays. In current work, photo-oxidation products are utilized to achieve highly sensitive PEC detection for biomolecules under ultraviolet light as well as avoid the effects of multiple modifications in the same region on the reproducibility, which is beneficial for opening up rich possibility for designing more efficient analytical strategy.

AB This work reports on a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) based field-effect transistor (FET) biosensor for ultra sensitive label-free detection of DNA via phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligos (PMO)-DNA hybridization. After the chip was fabricated and the sensing channel was modified with positive charges, the negatively charged MoS2 nanosheet was drop-casted onto the channel, enabling MoS2 to tightly bind to the sensing surface via electrostatic interactions. Meanwhile, DNA analogue, PMO, was immobilized on the MoS2 surface, and detection of PMO-DNA hybridization was conducted by the fabricated MoS2 FET biosensor. Due to the neutral character and high affinity of PMO, a limit of detection (LOD) down to 6 fM was obtained, which is lower than that of the previously reported MoS2 FET DNA biosensor based on DNA-DNA hybridization. In addition, the MoS2 FET biosensor also showed high sequence specificity capable of distinguishing the complementary DNA from one base mismatched DNA, three-base mismatched DNA and noncomplementary DNA. Moreover, the unique FET biosensor was able to detect DNA in complex sample like serum, making the method potential in disease diagnostics.

AB Point-of-care testing technique is increasingly important for healthcare management in human being's daily life. However, traditional biosensor systems for health care are relatively expensive, bulky and hard-to-handle, which largely limits their use in point of care testing. The problems mentioned above are successfully addressed with the popularization of smartphone and the development of microfluidic technology for their applications of biosensor, which integrates smartphones, microfluidic components and sensory elements together, paving the way for wide application of smartphone-based microfluidic biomedical sensory system. According to the varieties of analytes, the most common sensing modalities of biosensor systems are divided into imaging analysis to detect cells and bacteria, biochemical analysis to detect blood sugar and blood fat, immunoassay to detect protein specifically bound to antibody, as well as molecular diagnosis to detect DNA and other biomolecules. Based on the most common analytical methods, this review article covers five types of smartphone-based microfluidic biosensor systems at the point-of-care detection, i.e., smartphone-based imaging biosensor, smart phone -based biochemical sensor, smartphone-based immune biosensor, smartphone-based hybrid biosensor with more than one sensing modality, and smartphone-based molecular sensor. We lay emphasis on reviewing the structures, analytical methods and sensing modalities about the four kinds of biosensor systems with detailed discussions on their application potentials, aiming at giving the audience an overview of the recent developments of automatic smartphone-based microfluidic biosensor systems, as well as their future prospective.

AB A novel electrochemical immunosensor based on carbon paste electrode (CPE) composed of ionic liquid (IL) and graphite was constructed. It demonstrated good efficiency for quick (each test in 30 s) determination of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Electrode surface was modified by gold nanoparticles in order to immobilize of the thyroid stimulating hormone antibody (anti-TSH) on the CPE. The immunoassay structure was established by sandwiching the antigen (TSH) between the thyroid stimulating hormone antibody on the CPE surface modified with gold nanoparticles and the secondary antibody, polyclonal anti-human-TSH labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP-labeled anti-TSH). The signal of differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was used as a basis for the determination of TSH concentration. This signal is generated by the reaction between O-aminophenol (OAP) and H2O2 catalyzed by HRP. The proposed immunosensor is able to measure the concentration of TSH in a linear range between 0.2 and 90.0 ng/mL with a detection limit 0.1 +/- 0.02 ng/mL. In addition, high sensitivity and acceptable stability were achieved by this immunosensor which is promising in the clinical assay of TSH.

AB A new chiral sensor based on weak measurement to accurately measure the optical rotation (OR) has been developed for the estimation of a trace amount of chiral molecule. With the principle of optical weak measurement in frequency domain, the central wavelength shift of output spectra is quantitatively relative to the angle of preselected polarization. Hence, a chiral molecule (e.g., L-amino acid, or D-amino acid) can be enantioselectively determined by modifying the preselection angle with the OR, which will cause the rotation of a polarization plane. The concentration of the chiral sample, corresponding to its optical activity, is quantitatively analyzed with the central wavelength shift of output spectra, which can be collected in real time. Immune to the refractive index change, the proposed chiral sensor is valid in complicated measuring circumstance. The detections of Proline enantiomer concentration in different solvents were implemented. The results demonstrated that weak measurement acted as a reliable method to chiral recognition of Proline enantiomers in diverse circumstance with the merits of high precision and good robustness. In addition, this real-time monitoring approach plays a crucial part in asymmetric synthesis and biological systems.

AB Enzyme mimics have been developed for bioassay of nucleic acids, with some of them involving complicated labeling. Herein, we report a label-free bioassay for ultrasensitive electronic determination of microRNA at an ultralow concentration based on target-triggered long-range self-assembly DNA-based hybridization chain reaction (HCR) protocol coupled with bienzyme mimics synergistic catalysis strategy. In this work, a planar intercalation molecule, copper (II) complex, is applied for the first time as a small molecule enzyme mimic as well as intercalation molecule in microRNA biosensor for signal amplification. Fe3O4 nanozyme were used as a separate and enriched target under magnetic field, and also in combination with HCR protocol detected in 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine + hydrogen peroxide (TMB + H2O2) system to improve the sensitivity of the biosensor. Under optimal conditions, these strategies present good electrochemical behaviors for the detection of microRNA with a wide range from 100 aM to 100 nM and at relatively low detection limit of 33 aM This remarkable sensitivity can make this proposed approach a promising scheme for development of next-generation microRNA sensors without the need of enzyme labeling or fluorophore labeling.

AB Measurement of small molecules in extremely dilute concentrations of analyte play an important role in different issues ranging from food industry to biological, pharmaceutical and therapeutical applications. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors can be a suitable choice for detection of small molecules based on interactions with biomolecules. However, sensitivity of the system for detection of these molecules is very low. Improving sensitivity has been a challenge for years. Therefore, different methods have been used to enhance SPR signals. The SPR signal enhancement using numerous nanomaterials has provided exciting results. Among various nano materials, metal nanoparticles (for instance gold, silver and magnetic nanoparticles), quantum dots, nanorads, and carbon-based nanostructures have got much attention due to ease in fabrication, appropriate size and shape. In addition to the advantages provided by using nanomaterials, signal enhancement provided by the appropriate use of phase information of the reflected light could be also important to improve SPR sensitivity. Phase-sensitive SPR sensors are able to detect infinitesimal changes in external properties of target while traditional type of SPR cannot demonstrate these changes. This article provides an overview on signal enhancment in SPR using nanomaterials and properties of light. We also discuss on recent progresses of the field, describing basic concepts concerning nanostructures as well as phase-sensitive sensors as platform for enhancement of signal in SPR.

AB Although significant technological advancements have been made in the development of analytical biosensor chips for detecting bacterial strains (E. coli, S. Mutans and B. Subtilis), critical requirements i.e. limit of detection (LOD), fast time of response, ultra-sensitivity with high reproducibility and good shelf-life with robust sensing capability have yet to be met within a single sensor chip. In order to achieve these criteria, we present an electrically-receptive thermally-responsive (ER-TR) sensor chip comprised of simple filter paper used as substrate coated with composite of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) polymer (PNIPAm) - graphene nanoplatelet (GR) followed by evaporation of Au electrodes for capturing both Gram-positive (S. mutans and B. subtilis) and Gramnegative (E. coli) bacterial cells in real-time. Autoclave water, tap water, lake water and milk samples were tested with ER-TR chip with and without bacterial strains at varying concentration range 10(1)-10(5) cells/mL. The sensor was integrated with in-house built printed circuit board (PCB) to transmit/receive electrical signals. The interaction of E. coli, S. mutans and B. subtilis cells with fibers of PNIPAm-GR resulted in a change of electrical resistance and the readout was monitored wirelessly in real-time using MATLAB algorithm. Finally, prepared ERTR chip exhibited the reproducibility of 85-97% with shelf-life of up to four weeks after testing with lake water sample.

AB Herein, aptamer-modified self-propelled nanomotors were used for transportation of human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) from a human serum sample. For this purpose, the fabricated manganese oxide nanosheets-polyethyleneimine decorated with nickel/gold nanoparticles (Mn02-PEI/Ni/Au) as nanomotors were added to a vial containing thiolated aptamer KH1C12 solution as a capture aptamer to attach to the gold nanoparticles on the surface of nanomotors covalently. The aptamer-modified self-propelled nanomotors (aptamer(KH1C12)/nanomotors) were then separated by placing the vial in a magnetic stand. The aptamer-modified self-propelled nanomotors were rinsed three times with water to remove the non-attached aptamers. Then, the resulting aptamer(KH1C12)/nanomotors were applied for the on-the-fly" transporting of HL-60 cancer cell from a human serum sample. To release of the captured HL-60 cancer cells, the complementary nucleotide sequences of KH1C12 aptamer solution (releasing aptamer) that has a with capture aptamer was added to phosphate buffer solution (1 M, pH 7.4) containing HL-60/aptamericnici2/nanomotors. Because of the high affinity of capture aptamer to complementary nucleotide sequences of aptamerxmaz, the HL-60 cancer cells released on the surface of aptamer(KH1C12)/nanomotors into the solution. The second goal of the present work was determining the concentration of HL-60 cancer cell in the human serum samples. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique (EIS) was used for the determination of HL-60 cancer cell. The concentration of separated cancer cell was determined by aptamer/gold nanoparticles-poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) modified GC electrode (Gc/pEDOT-Au-nano/aptamer(KH1C12)). The proposed aptasensor exhibited a good response to the concentration of HL-60 cancer cells in the range of 2.5 x 10(1) to 5 x 10(5) cells mL(-1) with a low limit of detection of 250 cells mL(-1).

AB The integration of nanomaterials in the field of (bio)sensors has allowed developing strategies with improved analytical performance. In this work, ultrasmall core-shell Fe3O4@Au magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were used as the platform for the immobilization of event-specific Roundup Ready (RR) soybean and taxon-specific DNA sequences. Firstly, monodisperse Fe3O4 MNPs were synthesized by thermal decomposition and subsequently coated with a gold shell through reduction of Au(III) precursor on the surface of the MNPs in the presence of an organic capping agent This nanosupport exhibited high colloidal stability, average particle size of 10.2 +/- 1.3 rim, and spherical shape. The covalent immobilization of ssDNA probe onto the Au shell of the Fe3O4@Au MNPs was achieved through a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) created from mixtures of alkane thiols (6-mercapto-l-hexanol and mercaptohexanoic acid). The influence of the thiols ratio on the electrochemical performance of the resulting electrochemical genoassays was studied, and remarkably, the best analytical performance was achieved for a pure mercaptohexanoic acid SAM. Two quantification assays were designed; one targeting an RR sequence and a second targeting a reference soybean gene, both with a sandwich format for hybridization, signaling probes labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), enzymatic amplification and chronoamperometric detection at screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE). The magnetogenoassays exhibited linear ranges from 0.1 to 10.0 nM and from 0.1 to 5.0 nM with similar detection limits of 0.02 nM and 0.05 nM for the event-specific (RR) and the taxon-specific (lectin) targets, respectively. The usefulness of the approach was demonstrated by its application to detect genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in feed and food.

AB The type A influenza viruses are the most virulent and variable human pathogens with epidemic or even pandemic threat. The development of sensitive, specific and safe field testing methods is in particular need and quite challenging. We report here the selection and practical utilization of the inactivated influenza virus-specific aptamers. The DNA aptamers against inactivated intact H1N1 virus particles were identified through the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) procedure. The discriminative aptamers and their truncated sequences showed selectively high affinity to inactive H1N1 virus and H3N2 virus with the K-d in the low nanomolar range and collective binding properties. The truncated sequences were first applied in a sandwich enzyme-linked oligonucleotide assay (ELONA) with a H1N1 detection limit (LOD, S/N = 3) of 0.3 ng/and then in an electrochemical impedance (EIS) aptasensor with more than 300 times improved LOD (0.9 pg/mu L) and the excellent selectivity over other viruses (> 100 times). Therefore the developed aptasensors represent the safer, simpler, and possibly better virus-variation adaptable means of virus diagnostics.

AB A field-effect biosensor employing tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) particles as scaffolds for enzyme immobilization is presented. Nanotubular TMV scaffolds allow a dense immobilization of precisely positioned enzymes with retained activity. To demonstrate feasibility of this new strategy, a penicillin sensor has been developed by coupling a penicillinase with virus particles as a model system. The developed field-effect penicillin biosensor consists of an Al-p-Si-SiO2-Ta2O5-TMV structure and has been electrochemically characterized in buffer solutions containing different concentrations of penicillin G. In addition, the morphology of the biosensor surface with virus particles was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy methods. The sensors possessed a high penicillin sensitivity of similar to 92 mV/dec in a nearly-linear range from 0.1 mM to 10 mM, and a low detection limit of about 50 M. The long-term stability of the penicillin biosensor was periodically tested over a time period of about one year without any significant loss of sensitivity. The biosensor has also been successfully applied for penicillin detection in bovine milk samples.

AB Electrochemical (bio)sensors have attracted much attention due to their high sensitivity, fast response time, biocompatibility, low cost and easy miniaturization. Specially, ever-growing necessity and interest have given rise to the fast development of electrochemical (bio)sensors for the detection of small biomolecules. They play enormous roles in the life processes with various biological function, such as life signal transmission, genetic expression and metabolism. Moreover, their amount in body can be used as an indicator for diagnosis of many diseases. For example, an abnormal concentration of blood glucose can indicate hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. Graphene (GR) shows great applications in electrochemical (bio)sensors. Compared with two-dimensional (2D) GR that is inclined to stack together due to the strong pi-pi nteraction, monolithic 3D porous GR has larger specific area, superior mechanical strength, better stability, higher conductivity and electrocatalytic activity. So they attracted more and increasing attention as sensing materials for small biomolecules. This review focuses on the recent advances and strategies in the fabrication methods of 3D porous GR and the development of various electrochemical (bio)sensors based on porous GR and its nanocomposites for the detection of small biomolecules. The challenges and future efforts direction of high-performance electrochemical (bio)sensors based on 3D porous GR for more sensitive analysis of small biomolecules are discussed and proposed. It will give readers an overall understanding of their progress and provide some theoretical guidelines for their future efforts and development.

AB Impedance measurement of cells using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) is widely accepted as an effective method to assess cell status. However, the sensitive frequency drifts over time with the changes of culture condition according to the built circuit model and experimental results. The area-normalized impedance spectrum (ANIS) method, which uses normalized area of impedance spectrum in a certain interval to assess cell viability, was proposed in this paper to solve the problem. The certain interval is calculated due to the threshold Z(th) which is determined by 2% decline of the maximum impedance. Stabilities of two methods were analyzed by normalizing the area and impedance, showing that the normalized impedance fluctuated like a wave, while the normalized area was smoother. In addition, Cell Count Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was carried out proving that the correlation index of ANIS method increases by 2.4% compared with impedance sensing method, and the maximum error of ANIS method decreases by 4%. Comparison analysis of two methods with random measurement noise was also discussed in this paper, and the results showed that the ANIS method was less affected by measurement noise than impedance sensing method. It demonstrated that the ANIS method is a more stable and accurate method to assess cell viability.

AB As a conventional amplification technique, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been widely applied to detect a variety of analytes with exponential amplification efficiency. However, the requirement of thermocycling procedures largely limits the application of PCR-based methods. Alternatively, several isothermal amplification techniques have been developed since the early 1990s. In particular, according to the reaction kinetics, isothermal exponential amplification techniques possess higher amplification efficiency and detection sensitivity. The isothermal exponential amplification techniques can be mainly divided into two categories: enzyme-based isothermal exponential amplification and enzyme-free isothermal exponential amplification. Considering the advantages of high sensitivity and selectivity, high signal-to-noise ratio, low cost and rapid response time, exponential amplification electrochemical biosensors have attracted considerable attention. In this review, we introduce the basic principles of isothermal exponential amplification techniques and summarize their applications in electrochemical biosensors during the past five years. We also highlighted the present challenges and further perspectives of isothermal exponential amplification-based electrochemical biosensors.

AB By introduction of Mo metal species (molybdenum-based polyoxometalates) into the Cu-MOF as co-precursor, molybdenum carbide nanosphere (MoxC@C) was prepared via a simple calcining routine and a further etching the metallic Cu process. The obtained MoxC@C showed a unique structure where well-dispersed MoxC nanoparticles (NPs) were encapsulated in porous carbon matrix. As-fabricated novel 3D porous architecture MoxC@C nanosphere exhibited a potent and persistent electro-oxidation behavior followed by well-separated oxidation peaks (peak to peak voltage is about 35 mV) toward adenine (A) and guanine (G) by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). This excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the unique structure and composition of 3D MoxC@C. Furthermore, 3D MoxC@C also revealed high selectivity and sensitivity, good reproducibility, excellent stability and anti-interference ability. The calibration curves for quantitive analysis of G and A were obtained: 0.03-122 mu M, and 0.02-122 mu M, respectively, the detection limits were 0.0085 mu M, 0.008 mu M, respectively. The proposed procedure was successfully applied to detect G and A in human urine and serum samples with satisfactory recovery, which manifests its viability application for practical analysis.

AB Herein, we successfully devised a novel photoelectrochemical (PEC) platform for ultrasensitive detection of adenosine by target-triggering cascade multiple cycle amplification based on the silver nanoparticles-assisted ion-exchange reaction with CdTe quantum dots (QDs). In the presence of target adenosine, DNA s1 is released from the aptamer and then hybridizes with hairpin DNA (HP1), which could initiate the cycling cleavage process under the reaction of nicking endonuclease. Then the product (DNA b) of cycle I could act as the "DNA trigger" of cycle II to further generate a large number of DNA Si, which again go back to cycle I, thus a cascade multiple DNA cycle amplification was carried out to produce abundant DNA c. These DNA c fragments with the cytosine (C)-rich loop were captured by magnetic beads, and numerous silver nanoclusters (Ag NCs) were synthesized by AgNO3 and sodium borohydride. The dissolved AgNCs released numerous silver ions which could induce ion exchange reaction with the CdTe QDs, thus resulting in greatly amplified change of photocurrent for target detection. The detection linear range for adenosine was 1.0 fM similar to 10 nM with the detection limit of 0.5 fM. The present PEC strategy combining cascade multiple DNA cycle amplification and AgNCs-induced ion-exchange reaction with QDs provides new insight into rapid, and ultrasensitive PEC detection of different biomolecules, which showed great potential for detecting trace amounts in bioanalysis and clinical biomedicine.

AB An optimum copper concentration in environment is highly desired for all forms of life. We have developed an ultrasensitive copper sensor which functions from femto to micro molar concentration accurately (R-2 = 0.98). The sensor is based on denatured antibody immunoglobulin G (IgG), immobilized on polyaniline (PAni) which in turn is the coating on the core of an optical fiber. The sensing relies on changes in evanescent wave absorbance in the presence of the analyte. The sensor showed excellent selectivity towards Cu (II) ions over all other metal ions. The sensor was tested with lake and marine water samples to determine unknown concentrations of copper ions and the recovery results were within 90-115%, indicating reasonable accuracy. We further integrated the fiber-optic sensor with a miniaturized hand-held instrumentation platform to develop an accurate and field deployable device which can broadly be applicable to determine Cu (II) concentration in a wide range of systems - natural water bodies, soil as well as blood serum.

AB Staphylococcus aureus infections are a cause of significant morbidity and mortality, in addition to representing a considerable economic burden. The aim of this study was to explore a low cost screen printed electrode as a sensor for the detection of S. aureus using impedance spectroscopy. S. aureus was incubated in chambers containing the electrodes and the results analysed using a novel normalisation approach. These results show that it is possible to detect the presence of S. aureus in LB media after 30 min incubation of a 1% growth culture, in addition to being able to see immediate cell concentration dependant changes in 0.9% NaCl. These observations imply that a number of electrochemical mechanisms cause a change in the impedance as a result of the presence of S. aureus, including adsorption to the electrode surface and the metabolism of the bacteria during growth. The study suggests that this detection approach would be useful in a number of clinical scenarios where S. aureus leads to difficult to treat infections.

AB Flexible and implantable glucose biosensors are emerging technologies for continuous monitoring of blood glucose of diabetes. Developing a flexible conductive substrates with high active surface area is critical for advancing the technology. Here, we successfully fabricate a flexible and highly sensitive nonenzymatic glucose by using DVD-laser scribed graphene (LSG) as a flexible conductively substrate. Copper nanoparticles (Cu-NPs) are electrodeposited as the catalyst. The LSG/Cu-NPs sensor demonstrates excellent catalytic activity toward glucose oxidation and exhibits a linear glucose detection range from 1 mu M to 4.54 mM with high sensitivity (1.518 mA mM(-1)cm(-2)) and low limit of detection (0.35 01). Moreover, the LSG/Cu-NPs sensor shows excellent reproducibility and long-term stability. It is also highly selective toward glucose oxidation under the presence of various interfering species. Excellent flexing stability is also demonstrated by the LSG/Cu-NPs sensor, which is capable of maintaining 83.9% of its initial current after being bent against a 4-mm diameter rod for 180 times. The LSG/Cu-NPs sensor shows great potential for practical application as a nonenzymatic glucose biosensor. Meanwhile, the LSG conductive substrate provides a platform for the developing next-generation flexible and potentially implantable bioelectronics and biosensors.

AB Blood tests (e.g., red blood cell (RBC) count) are crucial for detecting, diagnosing, and monitoring the progression of blood disorders. Here, we report the development of a new and rapid method for electrochemically detecting RBCs using single-particle collision events. The principle of this method relies on the electrochemical oxidation of an electroactive redox species (potassium ferrocyanide) hindered by an RBC attached to an electrode surface. A decrease in staircase current, caused by the collision of RBCs on the electrode, was observed. The magnitude of this current decrease could provide quantitative information on the size and concentration of RBCs, which could be converted into the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and used for diagnosis. Anemia related diseases caused by abnormal count of RBCs (e.g., erythrocytosis, pernicious anemia) or abnormal RBC size (e.g. megaloblastic anemia, microcytic anemia) could be detected easily and quickly using this electrochemical collision method, potentially leading to extensive applications in hematology and point-of-care blood testing devices.

AB Pig ear skin membrane-covered glucose biosensor based on oxygen electrode has been assessed as a tool to evaluate glucose penetration through skin in-vitro. For this, glucose oxidase (GOx) was immobilised on oxygen electrode and covered with the skin membrane. Exposing this electrode to the solution of glucose resulted in glucose penetration though skin membrane, its oxidation catalysed by GOx, consumption of O-2 and decrease of the current of the oxygen electrode. By processing the biosensor responses to glucose, we found that glucose penetration through 250 pm thick skin membrane is slow; 90% of steady-state current response was reached in 32(+/- 22) min. Apparent diffusion coefficient for glucose in skin was found to be equal to 0.15( +/- 07)* 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1). This value is 45 times lower than glucose diffusion coefficient in water. Tape-stripping of stratum corneum (SC) allows considerably faster glucose penetration. The electrodes covered with tape-stripped skin reached 90% of steady-state current response in 5.0(+/- 2.7) min. The theoretical estimate of glucose flux through SC was considered exploiting four-pathway theory of transdermal penetration. Theoretical flux values were more that three orders lower than measured experimentally. This high discrepancy might indicate that glucose penetration through healthy human skin could be even slower, allowing much lower flux, than it was found in our study for skin membranes from pig ears.

AB In this work, Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) encapsulated in metal -organic frameworks (MOFs) UiO-67 (Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)/UiO-67) as luminophor was easily prepared and firstly applied in constructing an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor to efficiently estimate diethylstilbestrol (DES). The competitive method-based ECL immunosensor platform was fabricated by amino-silicon dioxide which possesses large surface area. The poriness of UiO-67 was splendid so that Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) could be easily encapsulated. Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)/UiO-67 with excellent ECL luminescence signal existed large specific surface area for easily labeled with antibodies. DES competed with bovine serum albumin-diethylstilbestrol (BSA-DES) for binding to antibody-specific sites in the constructed immunosensor. However DES was micromolecule, which was easier to bond to antibodies than BSA-DES. The ECL signal was gradually decreases with the increase of the concentration of DES. Under optimal conditions, the proposed immunosensor exhibited a wide linear range from 0.01 pg mL(-1) to SO ng(-1) with a low detetion limit of 3.27 fg(-1) (S/N = 3). The novel fabricated immunosensor with interference immunity and high stability may cause an attractive approach for the other targets determination.

AB Whereas the study of interfaces and thin films with the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is well established, biofilms have proven to be a difficult subject for the QCM. The main problem is that the shear wave emanating from the resonator surface does not usually reach to the top of the sample. This problem can be solved with torsional resonators. These have a resonance frequency in the range of tens of kHz, which is much below the frequency of the thickness-shear QCMs. The depth of penetration of the shear wave is correspondingly larger. Data acquisition and data analysis can proceed in analogy to the conventional thickness-shear QCM. Torsional resonators may also be operated as electrochemical QCMs (EQCMs), meaning that a DC electrical potential may be applied to the active electrode and that shifts of frequency and bandwidth may be acquired in parallel to the electrical current. Here we report on the formation of mixed-culture biofilms dominated by the microorganism Geobacter anodireducens. The viscoelastic analysis evidences an increase in rigidity as the films grows. Potential sweeps on electroactive biofilms reveal a softening under negative potentials, that is, under conditions, where the layer's metabolism was slowed down by insufficient oxidative activity of the substrate. For comparison, biofilms were monitored in parallel with a conventional thickness-shear QCM.

AB Immune response to environmental pathogen invasion is a complex process to prevent host from further damage. For quantitatively understanding immune responses and revealing the pathogenic environmental information, real-time monitoring of such a whole dynamic process with single-animal resolution in well-defined environments is highly desired. In this work, an integrated microfluidic device coupled with worm-based biosensor was proposed for in vivo studies of dynamic immune responses and antibiotics interference in infected C. elegans. Individual worms housed in chambers were exposed to the various pathogens and discontinuously manipulated for imaging with limited influence on physiological activities. The expression of immune responses gene (irg-1) was time-lapse measured in intact worms during pathogen infection. Results demonstrated that irg-1 gene could be induced in the presence of P. aeruginosa strain PA14 in a dose-dependent manner, and the survival of infected worm could be rescued under gentamicin or erythromycin treatments. We expect it to be a versatile platform to facilitate future studies on pathogenesis researches and rapid drug screen using C. elegans disease model.

AB Although surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique and aptamer technology shows great potential in analytical and biological chemistry, direct capture and analysis of small molecules using SPR remains tough. Detection sensitivity of aptasensor and recognition ability of aptamer is limited, because direct immobilization of aptamer causes large steric hindrance and strand entanglement Herein, we chose a typical small molecule-tetracycline (Mw. 444.4 g/mol) as a model, and combined aptamer technology, DNA nanostructure, and commercial Biacore T200 SPR instrument to develop a straightforward format SPR aptasensor. Anti-tetracycline aptamer (Apt76) was fabricated on the top of a tetrahedron nanostructure to provide a better accessibility to tetracycline than the single-stranded Apt76 (ss-Apt76), and thus to improve sensitivity of the SPR aptasensor. The aptasensor was then validated in real world application for tetracycline screening in multiple honey samples, achieving good recovery rates of 80.20-114.3%, intuitive sensorgrams indicating the binding kinetic properties, and high specificity towards tetracycline. LOD of the tetrahedron-based SPR aptasensor was obtained using the real honey sample and calculated to be 0.0069 mu g/kg, which was 10-fold range lower than that of the ss-Apt76-based aptasensor. The proof-of-concept demonstrated that aptamers of small molecules can be oriented immobilized on the SPR surface in a uniform nanoscale distance in both lateral and vertical direction, so as to achieve better conformational folding and better accessibility to small molecules. The concept is promising to be a universal and powerful tool for other ligand immobilization and SPR studies for both real world detection and molecular interaction.

AB This paper describes a new approach for the massive production of electrochemical paper-based analytical devices (ePADs). These devices are fully fabricated by screen-printing technology and consist of a lineal microfluidic channel delimited by hydrophobic walls (patterned with diluted ultraviolet screen-printing ink in chromatographic paper grade 4) and a three-electrode system (printed with carbon and/or Ag/AgCl conductive inks). The printing process was characterised and optimized for pattern each layer with only one squeeze sweep. These ePADs were used as transducers to develop a glucose biosensor. Ionic strength/pH buffering salts, electrochemical mediator (ferricyanide) and enzyme (glucose dehydrogenase FAD-dependent) were separately stored along the microfluidic channel in order to be successively dissolved and mixed after the sample dropping at the entrance. The analyses required only 10 mu l and the biosensors showed good reproducibility (RSD = 6.2%, n = 10) and sensitivity (0.426 C/M cm(2)), wide linear range (0.5-50 mM; r(2) = 0.999) and low limit of detection (0.33 mM). Furthermore, the new biosensor was applied for glucose determination in five commercial soft-drinks without any sample treatment before the analysis. These samples were also analysed with a commercial enzymatic-kit assay. The results indicated that both methods provide accurate results.

AB In this study, a novel electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor for sensitive detection of femtomolar miRNA-141 was constructed on the basis of Faraday cage-type strategy via graphene oxide (GO) and hybridization chain reaction (HCR)-assisted cascade amplification. A capture probe (CP) was immobilized on Fe3O4@SiO2@Au nanoparticles as capture unit, which could catch the miRNA-141, and the immobilization of the signal unit (Ru (phen)(3)(2+)-HCR/GO) was allowed via nucleic acid hybridization. The prepared biosensor exhibited two advantages for signal amplification: firstly, GO could lap on the electrode surface directly, extending Outer Helmholtz Plane (OHP) of the sensor due to the large surface area and good electronic transport property; secondly, HCR-assisted cascade amplification was designed by anchoring all HCR products on the GO surface, then embedding Ru(phen)(3)(2+) as a signal readout pathway. All these signal molecules could take part in electrochemical reactions, thus further enhancing the ECL signal drastically. Therefore, the proposed sensor constructed by integrating HCR with Faraday cage-type strategy displayed an ultrasensitive detection platform for the miRNA-141 with a low detection limit of 0.03 fM. In addition, this proposed biosensor provides a universal platform for analysis of other microRNAs.

AB Two new inorganic-organic hybrid materials based on heteropolyoxometalates (POMs): (C4H10N)(6)[P2Mo18O62]center dot 4H(2)O (P2Mo18) and (C6H8NO)(4)[H2P2W18O62]center dot 6H(2)O (P2W18) are reported as mediators for electron transfer between FAD-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (FAD-GDH) and a multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) matrix for glucose biofuel cell and biosensor applications. These polyoxometalates were chosen due to their promising redox behavior in a potential range for mediated electron transfer with the glucose oxidizing enzyme, FAD-GDH. P2Mo18 and P2W18 were immobilized on 1-pyrenemethylamine (PMA) functionalized MWCNT deposits. After immobilization of FAD-GDH, the P2W18-modified MWCNT electrode demonstrated mediated electron transfer and provided a catalytic current density of 0.34 mA cm(-2) at 0.2 V vs SCE with an open circuit potential (OCP) of -0.08 V vs SCE. A 10-fold increase in catalytic current to 4.7 mA cm(-2) at 0.2 V vs SCE and a slightly lower OCP of - 0.10 V vs SCE was observed for an equivalent electrode modified with P2Mo18.The apparent superiority of P2Mo18 is related, at least in part, to its improved incorporation in the MWCNT matrix compared to P2W18. Both POM-modified bioanodes showed exceptional stabilities with 45% of their initial performances remaining after 15 days. The mediated electron transfer capacities of the POMs were also evaluated in a glucose sensor setup and showed very satisfying performances for glucose detection, including a sensitivity of 0.198 mA mol L-1 cm(-2), a satisfying linear range between 1 mmol L-1 and 20 mmol L-1, and good reproducibility for the P2Mo18 electrode.

AB DNA has emerged as a promising biomaterial for assembling a variety of nanostructures based on its programmable base pairing. It also has other remarkable properties including stability, prominent biocompatibility, and can easily be modified with functional groups for further applications. In the past few decades, researchers have established various design rules and assembly technologies to improve the stability and complexity of DNA nanostructures. The detection of cancer-associated biomarkers has significant importance in identifying patients with different clinical stages and also in developing adaptive therapeutic strategies. Due to their unique advantages, DNA nanostructures can be designed to serve as universal units to form biosensors for the detection of tumor biomarkers. In this review, we first present a brief introduction of the development of structural DNA nanotechnology. Then we summarize recent strategies for DNA nanostructure-based optical, electrochemical and mass sensitive biosensors in cancer detection. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities these technologies provide.

AB We report a label-free universal biosensing platform for highly selective detection of long nucleic acid strands. The sensor consists of an electrode-immobilized universal stem-loop (USL) probe and two adaptor strands that form a 4J structure in the presence of a specific DNA/RNA analyte. The sensor was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using K-3[Fe(CN)(6)]/K-4[Fe(CN)(6)] redox couple in solution. An increase in charge transfer resistance (R-CT) was observed upon 4J structure formation, the value of which depends on the analyte length. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to further characterize the sensor and monitor the electrochemical reaction in conjunction with thickness measurements of the mixed DNA monolayer obtained using spectroscopic ellipsometry. In addition, the electron transfer was calculated at the electrode/electrolyte interface using a rotating disk electrode. Limits of detection in the femtomolar range were achieved for nucleic acid targets of different lengths (22 nt, 60 nt, 200 nt). The sensor produced only a background signal in the presence of single base mismatched analytes, even in hundred times excess in concentration. This label-free and highly selective biosensing platform is versatile and can be used for universal detection of nucleic acids of varied lengths which could revolutionize point of care diagnostics for applications such as bacterial or cancer screening.

AB Molecular recognition, i.e., ability of one molecule to recognize another through weak bonding interactions, is one of the bases of life. It is often implemented to sensing systems of high merits. Preferential recognition of the analyte (guest) by the receptor (host) induces changes in physicochemical properties of the sensing system. These changes are measured by using suitable signal transducers. Because of possibility of miniaturization, fast response, and high sensitivity, field-effect transistors (FETs) are more frequently being used for that purpose. A FET combined with a biological material offers the potential to overcome many challenges approached in sensing. However, low stability of biological materials under measurement conditions is a serious problem. To circumvent this problem, synthetic receptors were integrated with the gate surface of FETs to provide robust performance. In the present critical review, the approach utilized to devise chemosensors integrating synthetic receptors and FET transduction is discussed in detail. The progress in this field was summarized and important outcome was provided.

AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a new class of porous materials have attracted increasing attention in the field of biomimetic catalysis. This study firstly reports a mixed valence state Ce-MOF possessing intrinsic catalytic activity towards thionine (Thi), and its application in constructing an amplified electrochemical aptasensor for thrombin detection. As noticed, the novel catalytic process combines the advantages of 3D infinite extension of the Ce(III, IV)-MOF skeleton containing large amounts of catalytic sites and spontaneous recycling of the Ce(III)/Ce(IV) for electrochemical reduction of Thi, thereby presenting amplified electrochemical signals. To further improve the aptasensor performance, the high selectivity of proximity binding-induced DNA strand displacement and high efficiency of exonuclease III-assisted recycling amplification were incorporated into the assay. The aptasensor was employed to detect thrombin in complex serum samples, which shows high sensitivity, specificity, stability and reproducibility. This work offers an opportunity to develop MOF-based electrocatalyst as signal-amplifying tag for versatile bioassays and catalytic applications.

AB A new photoluminescence (PL) enzyme immunoassay was designed for sensitive detection of aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) via an innovative enzyme substrate, 6-aza-2-thiothymine-stabilized gold nanocluster (AAT-AuNC) with L-arginine. The enzyme substrate with strong PL intensity was formed through supramolecular host-guest assembly between guanidine group of L-arginine and AAT capped on the surface of AuNC. Upon arginase introduction, the captured L-arginine was hydrolyzed into ornithine and urea, thus resulting in the decreasing PL intensity. Based on this principle, a novel competitive-type immunoreaction was first carried out on AFB(1)-bovine serum albumin (AFB(1)-BSA) conjugate-coated microplate, using arginase-labeled anti-AFB(1), antibody as the competitor. Under the optimum conditions, the PL intensity increased with the increment of target AFB(1), and allowed the detection of the analyte at concentrations as low as 3.2 pg mL(-1) (ppt). Moreover, L-arginine-AAT-AuNC-based PL enzyme immunoassay afforded good reproducibility and acceptable specificity. In addition, the accuracy of this methodology, referring to commercial AFB(1) ELISA kit, was evaluated to analyze naturally contaminated or spiked peanut samples, giving well-matched results between two methods, thus representing a useful scheme for practical application in quantitative monitoring of mycotoxins in foodstuff.

AB In this study, a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-based nanostructured composite working electrode of high quality was successfully microfabricated and micro-patterned on a flexible polyimide substrate using simple low-cost fabrication processes. Gold and platinum alloy nanoparticles were electrochemically deposited onto the microfabricated rGO surface and chitosan-glucose oxidase composites were integrated onto the modified surface of the working electrode to develop a human sweat-based wearable glucose sensor application. The fabricated biosensor exhibited excellent amperometric response to glucose at a detection range of 0-2.4 mM (covers the glucose range in sweat), with a sensitivity of 48 mu A/mMcm(2), a short response time (20 s), and high linearity (0.99). The detection limit for glucose was calculated as 5 mu m. The human sweat/mixing glucose samples initially used for testing indicated acceptable detection performance and stability for low glucose concentrations. These results confirm that the proposed nanostructured composite flexible working electrode and fabrication process are highly promising for application as human sweat-based electrochemical glucose sensors.

AB A critical unmet need in the diagnosis of bacterial infections, which remain a major cause of human morbidity and mortality, is the detection of scarce bacterial pathogens in a variety of samples in a rapid and quantitative manner. Herein, we demonstrate smartphone-based detection of Staphylococcus aureus in a culture-free, rapid, quantitative manner from minimally processed liquid samples using aptamer-functionalized fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles. The tagged S.aureus cells were magnetically captured in a detection cassette, and then fluorescence was imaged using a smartphone camera with a light-emitting diode as the excitation source. Our results showed quantitative detection capability with a minimum detectable concentration as low as 10 cfu/ml by counting individual bacteria cells, efficiently capturing S. aunts cells directly from a peanut milk sample within 10 min. When the selectivity of detection was investigated using samples spiked with other pathogenic bacteria, no significant non-specific detection occurred. Furthermore, strains of S. aureus from various origins showed comparable results, ensuring that the approach can be widely adopted. Therefore, the quantitative fluorescence imaging platform on a smartphone could allow on-site detection of bacteria, providing great potential assistance during major infectious disease outbreaks in remote and resource-limited settings.

AB It is well known that the conventional electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor rely on the heterogeneous assay formats that involves the immobilization of biorecognition probe on the electrode surface before signal collection, which inevitably cause the efficiency of bio-recognition reactions to be limited owing to the existence of local steric hindrance. Herein, a robust, magnetic, and self-accelerated ECL nanosensor based on the multi-functionalized cobalt ferrite magnetite nanoparticles (CoFe2O4 MNPs) was firstly designed for copper ion (Cu2+) detection in quasi-homogeneous system. The prepared nanosensor has its unique advantages compared to the iron oxide (Fe3O4) MNPs-based nanosensor for which magnetic nanoparticle Just provide the reaction interface and magnetic enrichment. Specifically, the prepared CoFe(2)O(4 )MNPs-based biosensing platform could bridge the gap between aqueous phase and solid materials in homogeneous solution, achieving the expansion of reaction area and the reduction of local steric hindrance with high biorecognition efficiency. Furthermore, compared with the common magnetite nanosensors, the prepared CoFe2O4 MNPs achieved a set of magnetic collection, biorecognition probes immobilization, rapid separation and signal amplification in an ECL measurement system because it could act as a new co-reaction accelerator in ECL ternary (PTC-NH2 + S2O82-+ CoFe2O4 ) system, achieving a self-accelerated biosensing platform with significant enhancement of the detection sensitivity. As expected, the prepared CoFe2O4 MNPs-based ECL nanosensors were successfully applied for ultrasensitive detection of Cu2+ via click reaction with a linear range from 10(-13 )M to 1.0 x 10(-7) M, which exhibited high sensitivity, excellent selectivity and good reproducibility.

AB A porous graphite (PG) is proposed as anode electrocatalyst of microbial fuel cell (MFC), which is synthesized by thermally decomposing ferrous gluconate followed by leaching iron. The physical characterizations from scanning electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, indicate that the resulting PG is mesopore-rich and exhibits high graphitization with oxygen-containing functional groups. When evaluated on a naked carbon felt (NCF) anode, the resulting PG provides the MFC based on Escherichia call with excellent power output. The MFC using the carbon felt anode loaded with 3.0 mg cm(-2) PG delivers a maximum power density of 2.6 W m(-2) , compared to the 0.2 W m(-2) for the MFCs using NCF anode. This excellent performance is attributed to the electronically conductive graphite and porous structure of the resulting PG. The former provides the anode with high activity towards redox reactions of c-type cytochromes in bacteria, the latter stimulates bacteria to produce their flagella that help bacteria to firmly bond each other.

AB In this work, a novel and sensitive electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor for protein kinase A (PKA) activity analysis and relevant inhibitor screening was proposed based on bimetallic catalysis signal amplification and recognition of Au and Pt nanoparticles loaded metal-organic frameworks (Au&Pt@UIO-66) nanocomposite. After being phosphorylated by PKA in the presence of ATP, Au&Pt@UIO-66 probes were specifically chelated to the modified electrode by forming Zr-O-P bonds between the surface defects of UIO-66 and the phosphorylated kemptide. Due to the high synergistic catalysis of Au&Pt@UIO-66 nanocomposites to the luminol-H2O2 reaction, the ECL signal of luminol was greatly enhanced. Moreover, UIO-66 afford numerous Zr defect sites for high efficient phosphate group recognition, and can also prevent the nanoparticles from aggregating during catalytic reactions. Thus, the excellent performance of the ECL biosensor with high sensitivity and superior stability was obtained. Under the optimized conditions, the detection limit for PKA activity was 0.009 UmL(-1) (S/N = 3). Meanwhile, the ECL biosensor was successfully applied in inhibitor screening and cell lysates PICA activity analysis, showing great promise in kinase related research.

AB A novel core-shell structure optical pH sensor is developed with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) serving as the core and silica as the shell, followed by grafting bovineserumalbumin (BSA) as another shell via glutaraldehyde cross-linking. The obtained core-shell-shell structure is shortly termed as UCNPs@SiO2@BSA, and its surface provides a platform for loading various pH sensitive dyes, which are alike "modules" to make it feasible for measuring pHs within different pH ranges by simply regulating the type of dyes. Generally, a single pH sensitive dye is adopted to respond within a certain pH range. This study employs bromothymol blue (BTB) and rhodamine B (RhB) to facilitate their responses to pH variations within two ranges, i.e., pH 5.99-8.09 and pH 4.98-6.40, respectively, with detection by ratio-fluorescence protocol. The core-shell-shell structure offers superior sensitivity, which is tens of times more sensitive than those achieved by ratio-fluorescence approaches based on various nanostructures, and favorable stability is achieved in high ionic strength medium. In addition, this sensor exhibits superior photostability under continuous excitation at 980 nm. Thanks to the near infrared excitation in the core-shell-shell structure, it effectively avoids the self-fluorescence from biological samples and thus facilitates accurate sensing of pH in various biological sample matrixes.

AB Molecular diagnostics that involve nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are crucial for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. In this study, we developed a simple, inexpensive, disposable, fully 3D printed microfluidic reactor array that is capable of carrying out extraction, concentration and isothermal amplification of nucleic acids in variety of body fluids. The method allows rapid molecular diagnostic tests for infectious diseases at point of care. A simple leak-proof polymerization strategy was developed to integrate flow-through nucleic acid isolation membranes into microfluidic devices, yielding a multifunctional diagnostic platform. Static coating technology was adopted to improve the biocompatibility of our 3D printed device. We demonstrated the suitability of our device for both end-point colorimetric qualitative detection and real-time fluorescence quantitative detection. We applied our diagnostic device to detection of Plasmodium falciparum in plasma samples and Neisseria meningitides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples by loop-mediated, isothermal amplification (LAMP) within 50 min. The detection limits were 100 fg for P. falciparum and 50 colony-forming unit (CFU) for N. meningitidis per reaction, which are comparable to that of benchtop instruments. This rapid and inexpensive 3D printed device has great potential for point-of-care molecular diagnosis of infectious disease in resource-limited settings.

AB The genotyping of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is addressed through methods based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) combined with user-friendly optical read-outs to cover the current demand for point-of-care DNA biomarker detection. The modification of primer design and reaction composition improved the assay selectivity yielding allele-specific results and reducing false-positive frequency. Furthermore, the reduced cost, ease of use and effectiveness of calorimetric detection (solution and hybridisation chip formats) were availed for the image capture by a smartphone, reching high sensitivity. In order to evaluate their discriminating capacities, LAMP-based methods were applied to human samples to genotype a SNP biomarker (rs1954787) located in the GRIK4 gene and related to the treatment response to anti-depressants drugs. Sensitive (limit of detection: 100 genomic DNA copies), reproducible ( < 15% error), fast (around 70 min) and low-cost assays were accomplished. Patient subgroups were correctly discriminated, agreeing with reference sequencing techniques. The achieved analytical performances using the developed amplification-detection principles confirmed the approach potential for point-of-care optical DNA testing.

AB The combination of nanoparticles and biomarkers yields functional nanostructured biointerface, which is playing a notable role in biotechnology development. Due to the 5-fold twined structure in the Au-Pt star-shaped decahedra not only allowed it to act as efficient scaffold for immobilization of antibody, but it also exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity toward H2O2 reduction, the nanocrystal as the efficient signal transduction label is first employed to construct an electrochemical immunosensor. Donor-pi-Acceptor (D-pi-A) linking fashion generates a dipolar push-pull system and assures superior intramolecular charge transfer. It is considered as a suitable pi-conjugated backbone for conducting polymer on biointerface application. Under a D-pi-A architecture which imidazole as the pi-bridge and amino phenyl/phenyl groups as peripheral electron-donating/ withdrawing functional groups, 4-(2,4,5-triphenyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl) aniline (TPIDA) is designed and synthesized for good biocompatibility and high conductivity. In this proposal, we attempt to integrate the above-mentioned two features from nanobiotechnology and organic bioelectronics. Then, a novel nonenzymatic sandwich-type immunosensor is performed by Au-Pt core-shell with surface-engineered twinning as a label and pi-conjugated D-pi-A polymers as the signal amplification platform. Human IgG (HIgG) as the model target protein can be detected with a wide linear range from 0.1 pg mL(-1) to 100 ng mL(-1 ). The detection limit is down to 0.06 pg mL(-1) (S/N = 3). Moreover, as a practical application, the prepared biosensor is used to monitor HIgG level in human serum with desirable results obtained.

AB Sensitive and specific detection of DNA is of great significance for clinical diagnosis. In this paper, an effective cascade signal amplification strategy was introduced into photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor for ultra-sensitive detection of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) DNA. This proposed signal amplification strategy integrates lambda-exonuclease (lambda-Exo) aided target recycling with hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and enzyme catalysis. In the presence of target DNA (tDNA) of HTLV-I, the designed hairpin DNA (h(1)DNA) hybridized with tDNA, subsequently recognized and cleaved by lambda-Exo to set free tDNA. With the lambda-Exo aided tDNA recycling, an increasing number of DNA fragments (output DNA, oDNA) were released from the digestion of h(1)DNA. Then, triggered by the hybridization of oDNA with capture DNA (cDNA), numerous biotin-labeled hairpin DNAs (h(2)DNA and h(3)DNA) could be loaded onto the photoelectrode via the HCR. Finally, avidin-labeled alkaline phosphatase (avidin-ALP) could be introduced onto the electrode by specific interaction between biotin and avidin. The ALP could catalyze dephosphorylation of phospho-L-ascorbic add trisodium salt (AAP) to generate an efficient electron donor of ascorbic acid (AA), and thereby greatly increasing the photocurrent signal. By utilizing the proposed cascade signal amplification strategy, the fabricated PEC biosensor exhibited an ultrasensitive and specific detection of HTLV-I DNA down to 11.3 aM, and it also offered an effective strategy to detect other DNAs at ultralow levels.

AB A highly efficient method for aptamer screening with real-time monitoring of the SELEX process was described by silver decahedra nanoparticles (Ag-10-NPs) enhanced surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRI). A microarray chip was developed by immobilization of target protein (Lactoferrin (Lac)) and control proteins (alpha-lactalbumin (alpha), beta-lactoglobulin (beta), casein, and bovine serum albumin (BSA)) on the biochip surface. Ag-10-NPs were conjugated with an ssDNA library (Hb) (Ag-10-NPs-library) that consisted of a central 40 nt randomized sequence and a 20 nt fixed primer sequence. Introduction of the Ag-10-NPs-library to the SPRI flow channels drastically increased the sensitivity of SPRI signal for real-time monitoring of SELEX. The work allows rapid screening of potential targets, and yields nine aptamers with high affinity (nanomolar range) for Lac after only six-rounds of selection. The aptamer Lac 13.26 was then further tested by SPRI, and the results demonstrated that the aptamer had the capacity to be ultra-sensitive for specific detection of Lac. The novel SPRI-SELEX method demonstrated here showed many advantages of real-time evaluation, high throughput, and high efficiency.

AB In this paper we present a wirelessly powered array of 128 centrifugo-pneumatic valves that can be thermally actuated on demand during spinning. The valves can either be triggered by a predefined protocol, wireless signal transmission via Bluetooth, or in response to a sensor monitoring a parameter like the temperature, or homogeneity of the dispersion. Upon activation of a resistive heater, a low-melting membrane (Parafilm (TM)) is removed to vent an entrapped gas pocket, thus letting the incoming liquid wet an intermediate dissolvable film and thereby open the valve. The proposed system allows up to 12 heaters to be activated in parallel, with a response time below 35, potentially resulting in 128 actuated valves in under 30 s. We demonstrate, with three examples of common and standard procedures, how the proposed technology could become a powerful tool for implementing diagnostic assays on Lab-on-a-Disc. First, we implement wireless actuation of 64 valves during rotation in a freely programmable sequence, or upon user input in real time. Then, we show a closed-loop centrifugal flow control sequence for which the state of mixing of reagents, evaluated from stroboscopically recorded images, triggers the opening of the valves. In our last experiment, valving and closed-loop control are used to facilitate centrifugal processing of whole blood.

AB The selective and sensitive detection of rare earth elements is thought to be difficult because the concentration of those elements in the sample is commonly at a low level and they normally have severe mutual interference which is caused by homologous chemical properties. In this study, a novel molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) sensor was fabricated for highly sensitive and selective determination of ultra-trace Tb3+. The Tb3+-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid complex (Tb-EDTA) as the template molecule was incorporated into mono-6-mercapto-beta-cyclodextrin (mono-6-SH-beta-CD) to form a Russian Matryoshka (RM)-structured molecule (CD/Tb-EDTA). Titanium isopropoxide was utilized in vapor sol-gel polymerization to construct MIP membrane. Moreover, the selectivity of the RM MIP sensor was remarkably enhanced by the "triple-selectivity" recognition of EDTA-toTb(3+), beta-CD-to-(Tb-EDTA), and 3D cavity-to-(CD/Tb-EDTA), while the sensitivity of the MW sensor was significantly improved by ECL signal enhancement based on double amplification, in other words, the electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET) between the ECL donor of CD/Tb-EDTA and the ECL acceptor of Ru(bpy) 3(2+), and the ECL enhancement by the co-reactant of CD/Tb-EDTA on Ru(bpy)3(Cl)2. When the imprinted cavities were occupied by Tb-EDTA during rebinding, the host-guest inclusion structured complex was formed and the ECL intensities produced by the Ru(bpy)3(Cl)2 ECL system increased with increasing concentration of Tb-EDTA. The proposed sensor was used for quantitative analysis of Tb3+ with concentrations ranging from 8.00 x 10(-13)mol/L to 4.00 x 10 A mol/L and successfully applied to detect Tb3+ in seawater samples. The detection limit of the sensor was found to be 3.90 x 10(-13) mol/L (DL = 38(b)/K), which is lower than previously reported values. Thus, the fabricated sensor is feasible for practical applications.

AB MicroRNA (miRNA) sensing, especially the miRNA-200 family, is increasingly targeted for cancer diagnostics. As the sensing schemes often rely on nanoparticles functionalized with a specific oligonucleotide, we investigate the hydribization conditions using the common case of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing of miRNA and a gold nanoparticle (Au NP) competitor. In this type of assays, the Au NPs compete with the microRNA to bind the capture probe immobilized on the gold surface. In our study, we simplify and improve the detection procedure by adopting 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (11-MUA) as linker to the gold surface, not only omitting the blocking step of 6-mercapto-l-hexanol (MCH), but also increasing the probe density. We report that the response in our SPR sensing studies increased with the size of Au NPs according to the plasmon ruler equation, but the larger AuNPs of 32 nm lacked colloidal stability. In addition, decreasing the ratio of oligonucleotide to Au NPs and the addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to hybridization buffer also favored a better response in SPR sensing of miRNA. The optimization led to an improved detection sensitivity in our competition method and a detection limit as low as 500 pM for miRNA-200b without amplification of miRNA and use of other amplification schemes.

AB A metal-free electrode using heteroatom-doped microporous carbon was fabricated for the ultrasensitive monitoring of mono-bioactive molecules and the selective signaling of dopamine (DA) secreted by living cells. The constructed electrode based on sulfur-doped microporous carbon (S-MC) shows a high surface area, a spherical construction, numerous carbon chain defects, and microporous structures, which are the key factors of the interactive signaling transducer, fast response, and active interfacial surfaces. The intrinsic features of S-MC with different %S-doping (S-MC-1, and S-MC-2) through the sp(2)-carbon chain create abundant catalytic active sites, facilitate molecular diffusion through the microporous structure, promote strong binding with the targeted molecules, and induce interactions at electrolyte-electrode interfaces. The S-MC-1 provides selective signaling in a tertiary mixture of DA, ascorbic acid (AA), and uric acid (UA) with a high sensitivity and a wide linear range of 0.01-5, 10-4000, and 1-2000 mu M, respectively. The detection limits were set at 3 nM, 1.26 mu M, and 0.23 mu M for DA, AA, and UA respectively. The S-MC-1 demonstrated a selective screening of DA released from PC12 cells under a K+ ion-stimulator with high sensitivity and promoted high biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity, high stability, and reliable reproducibility (%RSD ranged from 1 to 2.7). Our findings indicated that the S-MC-1 can be utilized as an in-vitro model for simultaneously monitoring extracellular-DA secreted from living cells and sensing mono-bioactive molecules in biological samples.

AB In this work, electrically-conducting poly(Toludine Blue) was employed for the first time as synthetic receptor film, prepared by Molecular Imprinting strategies and using electrochemical methods, for the specific screening of breast cancer biomarker Carbohydrate Antigen 15.3 (CA 15-3).
   The protein imprinted poly(Toluidine Blue) film was grown in a pre-formed Toluidine Blue (TB) tailed SAM at the AuSPE surface, which greatly enhanced the stability against degradation of the Molecular Imprinted Polymer (MIP) film at the electrode surface.
   The MIP receptor film recognition ability towards the protein was investigated by fitting data to Freundlich isotherm. The binding affinity (K-p) obtained for the MIP system was significantly higher (similar to 12-fold) to that obtained for the NIP system, demonstrating the success of the approach in creating imprinted materials that specifically respond to CA 15-3 protein.
   The incubation of the MIP modified electrode with increasing concentration of protein (from 0.10 U mL(-1) to 1000 U mL(-1)) resulted in a decrease of the ferro/ferricyanide redox current. The device displayed linear response from 0.10 U mL(-1) to 100 U mL(-1) and LODs below 0.10 U mL(-1) were obtained from calibration curves built in neutral buffer and diluted artificial serum, using DPV technique, enabling the detection of the protein biomarker at clinically relevant levels. The developed MIP biosensor was applied to the determination of CA 15-3 in spiked serum samples with satisfactory results.
   The developed device provides a new strategy for sensitive, rapid, simple and cost-effective screening of CA 15-3 biomarker. Importantly, the overall approach seems suitable for point-of-care (PoC) use in clinical context.

AB Functionalization of pi-conjugated polymers is dispensable for solubilization of the rigid and hydrophobic backbones in water. However, polymer aggregation is always present and leads to issues with complication and reproducibility in spectral properties. Herein, we reported a simple and robust method to make a series of conjugated polymer nanostructures by a crosslinking strategy. In favor of multivalency effect, polythionenes with various chain lengths were functionalized with branched polyethylenimine (PEI) via ester aminolysis reaction under mild conditions. Photophysical studies revealed the conjugated backbones could be well stabilized and dispersed in water. By taking advantage of intermolecular recognition interaction between copper ions and cationic PEI, we applied crosslinked polythiophenes as a nano probe at very low concentration (0.01 mg/mL) to fluorescently detect copper ions with high sensitivity up to 10 nM and selectivity over other metal ions in aqueous solutions, without occurrence of detectable aggregates. The overall performance of our nano probes outperforms reported water-soluble polymers-based probes, particularly in probe availability and manipulation as well as selective copper detection capability.

AB In the present study, the silver/halloysite nanotube/molybdenum disulfide (Ag/HNT/MoS2) nanocomposite was successfully synthesized. For this purpose, the lumen of HNTs was firstly modified by silver to generate Ag nanorods via chemical process and then the MoS2 layers deposited on the Ag/HNT nanocomposite by hydrothermal method. The characterization of Ag/HNT/MoS2 nanocomposite were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (ICED) analyses. The nanocomposite modified carbon paste electrode (CPE) was applied for the electrocatalytic detection of nitrite in aqueous solutions. It was demonstrated that the treatment of HNTs with Ag and MoS2 materials enhanced the catalytic performance of modified CPE. At optimal experimental conditions, the designed sensor displayed remarkable sensing ability toward nitrite oxidation, offering a good linearity from 2 to 425 mu M. The limit of detection (LOD) of the proposed strategy was estimated to be 0.7 mu M based S/N = 3. The good reproducibility, acceptable stability, fast response time and anti-interference performance of the proposed assay suggests that the modified CPE has great potential working as a nitrite electrochemical sensor for environmental applications.

AB This paper used piezoelectric sensor to study the dysfunction of endothelial cell monolayer barrier caused by inflammatory factors. The biocompatible conductive polymer membrane of pPy[pGlu]-pLys was prepared on the surface of the ITO work electrode to Improve the interface between the endothelial cell and the electrode. Both the impedance analysis data and the stable plateau stage of sensor's frequency shift indicated that endothelial cells formed a good monolayer barrier on this polymer surface. The response frequency shifts of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and histamine-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction were different, which distinguished their different stimulation mechanism. It provided a valuable analysis method for detecting the endothelial barrier function affected by inflammatory factor, and could further promote the application of piezoelectric sensor in cell biology and toxicology research.

AB The way of immobilization of the monoclonal antibody (type IgG) on the electrode surface has a significant effect on the amount of the immobilized protein and in consequence on current signal of protein. Herein, we demonstrate that the application of appropriately functionalized phenyl film allowed us to control the orientation of the antibody (Ab) molecules on the electrode surface. The influence of Ab orientation on the efficiency of antigen-antibody interaction was tested with an example blood plasma protein (ferritin; Ft). To control the orientation of Ab molecules the phenyl films containing -COOH or -NH2 groups were applied. Contrary to aminoethylophenyl layer, the carboxyphenyl film guaranteed the shortest distance between the redox center of the protein and the electrode surface. Additionally, the application of an external magnetic field together with magnetic nanoparticles allowed achieving the best orientation to observe well-defined ferritin current signals. The proposed method of ferritin detection can be successfully used in the concentration range of Ft between 0.1 and 30 mu g dL(-1). The detection limit for a carboxyphenyl film was estimated as 0.40 +/- 0.04 and 0.13 +/- 0.04 mu g dL(-1) for impedance and voltammetric measurements, respectively. In turn, for an aminoethylophenyl film the detection limit was 0.03 +/- 0.002 (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; EIS) and 0.02 +/- 0.002 mu gdL(-1) (differential pulse voltammetry, DPV). The interday precision (reproducibility) was calculated (4.10 + 9.10% RSD) together with the intraday precision / repeatability (3.20 + 8.0% RED) for the studied samples. The functionality of the sensor has been tested on rat blood samples. Based on the performed investigations it can be stated that the developed sensor was characterized by high selectivity and good sensitivity.

AB Time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic sensing of rolling immunomagnetically-labeled cells offers great potential for single cell function analysis at the bedside in even optically opaque media, such as whole blood. However, due to the spatial resolution of the sensor and the low flow rate regime required to observe the behavior of rolling cells, the concentration range of such a workflow is limited. Potential clinical applications, such as testing of leukocyte function, require a cytometer which can cover a cell concentration range of several orders of magnitude. This is a challenging task for an integrated dilution-free workflow, as for high cell concentrations coincidences need to be avoided, while for low cell concentrations sufficient statistics should be provided in a reasonable time-to-result. Here, we extend the spatial bandwidth of a magnetoresistive sensor with an adaptive and integratable workflow concept combining mechanical and magnetophoretic guiding of magnetically labeled targets for in-situ enrichment over a dynamic concentration range of 3 orders of magnitude. We achieve hybrid integration of the enrichment strategy in a cartridge mold and a giant-magnetoresistance (GMR) sensor in a functionalized Quad Flat No-Lead (QFN) package, which allows for miniaturization of the Si footprint for potential low-cost bedside testing. The enrichment results demonstrate that TOF magnetic flow cytometry with adaptive particle focusing can match the clinical requirements for a point-of-care (POC) cytometer and can potentially be of interest for other sheath-less methodologies requiring workflow integration.

AB A new portable electrochemical sensor based on 4-aminobenzoic acid-modified herringbone carbon nanotubes (hCNTs-4ABA/Au-IDA) has been developed for the simultaneous determination of ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA) in physiological fluids. AA and UA were quantified by chronoamperometry at 0.1 and 0.32 V, respectively, in phosphate buffer solution (PBS 0.25 M, pH 7.0). Significant results were obtained for the separate quantification of AA and UA, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.65 mu M for both analytes, and sensitivities of (9.0 +/- 0.4) A g(-1) mM(-1) and (8.8 +/- 0.3)A g(-1) mM(-1) for AA and UA, respectively. Repeatability was studied at 50 pM for AA and UA, providing relative standard deviations (RSD) lower than 9%. Additions of glucose, dopamine and epinephrine did not interfere with the AA and UA determination. Furthermore, UA did not interfere with AA determination at 0.1 V, although AA additions increased the current recorded at 0.32 V. The method has been successfully applied to human urine, perspiration and serum samples, without significant matrix effects, which allows for the use of an external calibration and the analysis of all the matrices investigated.

AB A sensitive electrochemical immunosensing platform for the detection of Cronobacter sakazakii was developed using a graphene oxide/gold (GO/Au) composite. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the Au nanoparticles, with an average size of < 30 nm, were well dispersed on the GO surface. For the detection of C. sakazakii, a polyclonal sakasakii antibody (IgG) was covalently immobilized to the Au nanoparticles on the surface of the GO/Au composite coated glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The electrochemical sensing performance of immunofunctionalized GCE was characterized by cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. Under optimized conditions, in pure culture there was a linear relationship between electrical signal and C. sakazakii levels over the range 2.0 x 10(2)-2.0 x 10(7) cfu/mL (R-2 = 0.999), with a detection limit of 2.0 x 10(1) cfu/mL. The total analytical time was 15 min per sample. The C. sakazakii electrochemical linmunosensing assay was able to successfully detect 2.0 x 10(1) cfu/mL of C. sakazakii in artificially contaminated powdered infant formula without any enrichment or pre-enrichment steps. Furthermore, the recovery rates of the C. sakazakii electrochemical immunosensing assay following spiking of powdered infant formula with different concentrations of C. sakazakii (cfu/mL) were 82.58% at 2.0 x 10(1) cfu/mL, 84.86% at 2.0 x 10(2) cfu/mL, and 95.40% at 2.0 x 10(3) cfu/mL. The C. sakazakii electrochemical immunosensing assay had good selectivity, reproducibility, and reactivity compared with other Cronobacter spp. and/or pathogens belonging to other genera, indicating its significant potential in the clinical diagnosis of C. sakazakii.

AB Novel and sensitive electrochemical sensor was fabricated for the assay of anti-HCV ledipasvir (LEDV) in different matrices. The designed sensor was based on 3D spinel ferromagnetic NiFe2O4 nanospheres and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) supported by morpholinium acid sulphate (MHS), as an ionic liquid (RGO/NSNiFe2O4/MHS). This sensor design was assigned to synergistically tailor the unique properties of nanostructured ferrites, RGO, and ionic liquid to maximize the sensor response. Electrode modification prevented aggregation of NiFe2O4, increasing electroactive surface area and allowed remarkable electro-catalytic oxidation of LEDV with an enhanced oxidation response. Differential pulse voltammetry was used for detection LEDV in complex matrices whereas; cyclic voltammetry and other techniques were employed to characterize the developed sensor properties. All experimental factors regarding sensor fabrication and chemical sensing properties were carefully studied and optimized. Under the optimum conditions, the designated sensor displayed a wide linear range (0.4-350 ng mL(-1)) with LOD of 0.133 ng mL(-1). Additionally, the proposed sensor demonstrated good selectivity, stability and reproducibility, enabling the quantitative detection of LEDV in Harvoni (R) tablets, human plasma and in a pharmacokinetic study. Our findings suggest that the developed sensor is a potential prototype material for fabrication of high-performance electrochemical sensors.

AB An improved sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor based on the novel signal amplification strategy was developed. Methylene blue (MB) loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) with polydopamine coating (PDA) were employed as "smart" labels, while phytic acid doped polyaniline hydrogel (PAM) with high adsorption capacity was acted as substrate. In this strategy, amount of redox species (MB) encapsulated in MSN by PDA will be released under acidic condition and then absorbed stably by PANI. Meanwhile, the label tended to drop down due to the destruction of polydopamine coating and the disassociation of antibody-antigen composites. The advantages of as-prepared immunosensor are as follows: (1) Higher electron transfer efficiency was obtained because of the decrease of relative position between MB and the electrode; (2) Lower impedance was achieved due to the loss of the labels and the dissociation of antigen-antibody insulating layer; (3) Abundant MB molecules were loaded on MSN/PDA nanocarrier with large pore volume for signal amplification. Under optimum conditions, the proposed immunosensor exhibited a low detection limit of 1.25 fg mL (-1) and a wide linear range from 10 fg mL (-1) to 100 ng mL (-1) for prostate specific antigen detection. Importantly, present method showed good stability, selectivity, and reproducibility, which possessed wide potential applications for the detection of other biomarkers.

AB miRNAs are among the novel biomarkers that can be evaluated for sensitive and early cancer diagnosis. In the present study, an electrochemical nanobiosensor has been fabricated to detect two gastric cancer (GC) related miRNAs simultaneously. By employing Au nanoparticles- and CdSe@CdS quantum dots-contained magnetic nanocomposites as electrochemical labels along with the polythiophene/reduced graphene oxide-modified carbon electrodes, this dual signal nanobiosensor showed a considerable performance in quantifying miR-106a (a GC oncogenic miRNA) and let-7a (a GC tumor suppressor miRNA). Using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), not only the accomplishment of desired biosensing platform construction was confirmed, but also its great specificity, appropriate selectivity, acceptable stability, and significant sensitivity were indicated. Through the combined analyses of the dual miRNAs, our nanobiosensor reached detection limit of 0.02 fM and 0.06 fM for let-7a and miR-106a, respectively. This multiplex PCR-free miRNA nanobiosensor demonstrates attractive potentials for promising applications in early diagnosis of GC and additionally the screen of any miRNA sequence.

AB The analytical performance of the multi enzymes loaded single electrode sensor (SES) and dual electrode sensor (DES) was compared for the detection of adenosine and metabolites. The SES was fabricated by covalent binding of tri-enzymes, adenosine deaminase (ADA), purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), and xanthine oxidase (XO) along with hydrazine (Hyd) onto a functionalized conducting polymer [2,2:5,2-terthiophene-3-(p-benzoic acid)] (pTTBA). The enzyme reaction electrode in DES was fabricated by covalent binding of ADA and PNP onto pTTBA coated on Au nanoparticles. The detection electrode in DES was constructed by covalent binding of XO and Hyd onto pTTBA coated on porous Au. Due to the higher amount (3.5 folds) of the immobilized enzymes and Hyd onto the DES than SES, and the lower Michaelis constant (Km) value for DES (28.7 mu M) compared to SES (36.1 mu M), the sensitivity was significantly enhanced for the DES (8.2 folds). The dynamic range obtained using DES was from 0.5 nM to 120.0 mu M with a detection limit of 1.43 nM +/- 0.02, 0.76 nM +/- 0.02, and 0.48 nM +/- 0.01, for adenosine (AD), inosine (IN), and hypoxanthine (Hypo) respectively. Further, the DES was coupled with an electrochemical potential modulated microchannel for the separation and simultaneous detection of AD, IN, and Hypo in an extracellular matrix of cancerous (A549) and non-cancerous (Vero) cells. The sensor probe confirms a higher basal level of extracellular AD and its metabolites in cancer cells compared to normal cells. In addition, the effect of dipyridamole on released adenosine in A549 cells was investigated.

AB It remains a significant challenge to study the interactions between metal ions and porphyrin molecules at single ion level. Here, we constructed a nanopore-based sensing for label-free and real-time analysis of the interaction between Cu2+ and 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)-porphyrin (TPPS). The results demonstrate that emerging electronic signatures of the Cu2+-TPPS complex that is completely different form the original free TPPS were observed in the alpha-hemolysin (alpha-HL) nanopore. Based on the distinctive electronic signal patterns between TPPS and Cu2+-TPPS complex, the unique nanopore sensor can achieve a highly sensitive detection of Cu2+ in aqueous media. The frequency of signature events showed a linear response toward the concentration of Cu2+ in the range of 0.03 mu M - 1.0 mu M, with a detection limit of 16 nM (S/N = 3). The sensing system also exhibited high selectivity against other metal ions, and the feasibility of this approach for practical applications was demonstrated with the determination of Cu2+ in running water.

AB The construction and biofunctionalization of the poly (C-caprolactone) (PCL)-chitosan (CHIT) nanofibrous mats, which included Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer modified montmorillonite (Mt), for the cell adhesion and electrochemical cytosensing were accomplished in this report. After the intercalation of the PAMAM generation zero dendrimer into the Mt, PAMAM-Mt decorated PCL-CHIT electrospun nanofibers were formed. The addition of PAMAM caused the decrease of contact angle of PCL-CHIT nanofibers. The covalent immobilization of a tripeptide namely Arginylglycylaspartate (RGD) on both the PCL-CHIT/Mt and PCL-CHIT/PAMAM-Mt surface was carried out. U87-MG and HaCaT (negative control) cell lines were incubated on the PCL-CHIT/Mt/RGD and PCL-CHIT/PAMAM-Mt/RGD. The proliferation studies and imaging of the cells were carried out on these fibers. Finally, electrochemical measurements were performed after each modification step by differential pulse/cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. U87-MG cells were grown better than HaCaT cells on the PCL-CHIT/PAMAM-Mt/RGD surfaces. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study that developed electrochemical cytosensor using electrospun nanofibers as a cell adhesion platform.

AB A novel Affimer-functionalised interdigitated electrode-based capacitive biosensor platform was developed for detection and estimation of Her4, a protein tumour biomarker, in undiluted serum. An anti-Her4 Affimer with a C-terminal cysteine was used to create the bio-recognition layer via self-assembly on gold interdigitated electrodes for the sensor fabrication. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the absence of redox markers was used to evaluate the sensor performance by monitoring the changes in capacitance. The Affimer sensor in buffer and in undiluted serum demonstrated high sensitivity with a broad dynamic range from 1 pM to 100 nM and a limit of detection lower than 1 pM both in buffer and in serum. Furthermore, the Affimer sensor demonstrated excellent specificity with negligible interference from serum proteins, suggesting resilience to nonspecific binding. The sensing ability of the present Affimer sensor in spiked undiluted serum suggests its potential for a new range of Affimer-based sensors. The fabricated Affimer sensor can thus be further adapted with other probes having affinities to other biomarkers for a new range of biosensors.

AB There has been an urgent need to quickly screen and isolate patients with viral infections from patients with similar symptoms at point-of-care. In this study, we introduce a new microfluidic method for detection of various viruses using rolling circle amplification (RCA) of pathogens on the surface of thousands of microbeads packed in microchannels. When a targeted pathogen meets the corresponding particular template, the DNAs are rapidly amplified into a specific dumbbell shape through the RCA process, forming a DNA hydrogel and blocking the flow path formed between the beads. Due to the significant increase in reaction surface area, the detection time was shortened to less than 15 min and the detection limit of various pathogens has been reached to 0.1 pM. By injecting the stained liquid, the existence of the target pathogens in a sample fluid can be determined with the naked eye. Furthermore, by integrating multi-channel design, simultaneous phenotyping of various infective pathogens (i.e., Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and others) in biological specimens can be performed at a point-of-care.y

AB In this study. a novel two-photon photothermal therapy (TP-PTT) agent based on an organic-metal microhybrid with surface Plasmon resonance (SPR) enhanced two-photon absorption (TPA) characteristic was designed and mthesized using a fluorescent cyano-carboxylic derivative 2-cyano-3-(9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl) -acrylic acid (abbreviated as CECZA) and silver nanoparticles through self-assembly process induced by the interfacial coordination interactions between the O/N atom of CECZA and Ag-+/- ion at the surface of Ag nanoparticles. The coordination interactions caused electron transfer from the Ag nanoparticles to CECZA molecules at the excited state, resulting in a decreased fluorescence quantum yield. The interfacial coordination interactions also en: hanced the nonlinear optical properties. including 13 times increase in the TPA cross-section (8). The decreased fluorescence auantum yield and increased two photon absorption caused by the SPR effect led excellent two: photon photothermal conversion. which was beneficial for the TP-PTT effect on HeLa cancer cells.

AB The conductivity of a biofilm is the key factor for the high current density of a bioelectrochemical system (BES). Most previous works have focused on electrode modification, but, this only benefits the microorganisms that directly contact the electrode. The low conductivity of biofilm limits the current density of the BES. In this work, gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) were successfully fabricated in situ into a Geobacter sulfurreducau biofilm to increase the conductivity. 20 ppm NaAuCI4 (the precursor) was slowly dropped into the anode chamber at a rate of 1.3 mL/h in a continuous-flow three-electrode BES. The Au(III) was transformed to Au-NPs, which then precipitated in the biofilm via biological mineralization. The current density of the anode Increased by 40%. Meanwhile, the removal percentage of the organic substrate (acetate) was enhanced 2.2 times, from 24.7% to 53.3%, after the in situ fabrication of Au-NPs. This method greatly lowered the charge transfer resistance of the anode and enhanced the anodic limiting current. Our results proved that the current density and organic removal rate of the G. sulfurreducens biofilm in the anode were effectively enhanced by in situ Au-NP fabrication. This work not only provides a simple and effective strategy for enhancing the electricity generation of BES with conductive NP fabrication, but also improves the understanding of the extracellular electron transfer (EET) of exoelectrogens.

AB Molecularly imprinted polymers prepared using traditional functional monomers and cross-linkers exhibit slow binding kinetics, low electrocatalytic activity and adsorption capacity. Herein, we report a new composite of ionic liquid-based graphene and molecularly imprinted polymer (IL-GR-MIP) with high electrocatalytic activity and adsorption capacity to construct an effective electrochemical sensor for 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BAP). Our objective was to enhance the efficiency of the sensor by incorporating more IL in the MIP framework. We synthesized IL-GR-MIP using ionic liquid 1-vinyl-3-butylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (IL1) as functional monomer, ionic liquid 1,4-butanediy1-3,3'-bis-l-vinylimidazolium dibromide (IL2) as cross-linker, 6-BAP as template, and GR as supporter. IL-GR-MIP was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscope. Compared with GR-MIP composites based on methacrylic acid or IL1 as functional monomer, N, N'-methylenebisacrylamide and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as cross-linker, the IL-GR-MIP (prepared with ionic liquids as functional monomer and cross-linker) sensor exhibited highest peak current for 6-BAP. The results indicate the ability of IL2 as cross-linker to enhance electrocatalytic activity and adsorption capacity for 6-BAP of IL-GR-MIP. Under the optimized conditions, the peak current of IL-GR-MIP sensor was linear to 6-BAP concentration in the range of 0.5-50 mu M with a detection limit of 0.2 mu M (S/N = 3). The IL-GR-MIP sensor exhibited good selectivity with the anti-interference ability of 1000-fold ascorbic acid in 6-BAP determination. Furthermore, we demonstrated practical applicability of IL-GR-MIP sensor in detecting 6-BAP in real samples with satisfactory results.

AB In this work, a new strategy of dual-reaction triggered sensitivity amplification for ultrasensitive electrochemical detection of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) was developed. The sensitivity of amperometric biosensor relies on the current signal differences (AI) caused by per unit concentration target. Benefited from dual-reaction catalytic activities of Pd nanoparticles, dual catalytic reactions were implemented in the biosensor to amplify the AI: (1) Fenton-like reaction was triggered by the probes to degrade redox species methylene blue; (2) catalytic precipitation reaction was followed subsequently to generate insoluble precipitation by 4-chloro-l-naphthol oxidation. Dual-enhancement of AI triggered by Pd nanoparticle-based catalytic probes significantly improved the detection performance of the biosensor. The peptide-cleavage based biosensor integrated Pd nanoparticle-based catalytic probes with reduced graphene oxide-Au/methylene blue-sodium alginate hydrogel (Au-rGO/MBSA) nanocomposites substrate for ultrasensitive detection of MMP-7. Under optimal conditions, the proposed biosensor exhibited a wide linear range from 10 fg mL(-1) to 10 ng mL(-1) with an ultralow detection limit of 3.1 fg mL(-1). This strategy successfully combines the multiple catalytic reactions triggered by nanomaterials with peptide-cleavage pattern in electrochemical biosensor, providing a promising method for detection of other proteases.

AB In current work highly sensitive and stable electrochemical sensor for simultaneous non-enzymatic detection of epinephrine (EP), L-tyrosine (L-Tyr) is constructed based on Electron beam irradiated Polypyrrole (EB-Ppy) nanospheres (Zeta potential 33.69 mV at pH 7) embedded over bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Zeta potential - 11.54 mV at pH 7) porous structure, fabricated by simple chemical routes. The BSA structure has the advantages of large surface area, excellent structure stability, rich pore channels and redox mediator role. The constructed sensor exhibited excellent sensor performances by the combination of protein with NH group and recorded the linear response of EP, L-Tyr individual in the concentration range of 100 nM-1 mM, 100 nM-800 mu M, with detection limit 7.1 nM, 8.8 nM (S/N = 3 sigma/b). The EB-Ppy-BSA/GCE electrochemical sensor manifests intriguing application with good sensitivity, selectivity and reproducibility towards the EP, L-Tyr detection. The practical analytical utility provides great promise by selective measurements in tea, and chicken extract which has a promising future for biological and healthcare applications.

AB In the present work, PNIPAM-DNA films were fabricated on the surface of electrodes by GOD-induced radical polymerization, where PNIPAM is poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), DNA represents natural DNA from salmon testes, and GOD is glucose oxidase. The prepared film electrodes demonstrated reversible temperature-, SO42-., and pH-switched cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) behaviors toward tris(2,2'-bipyridine)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)) in solution. Particularly, both CV and ECL signals at 1.15 V belonging to Ru (bpy)(3)(2+) were significantly amplified by the electrocatalysis of DNA in the films. Moreover, the addition of ferrocenemethanol (FcMeOH) into the solution led to the substantial quenching of the ECL signal of the system and produced a new CV peak pair at 0.35 V. Based upon these experiments, a 4-input/7-output logic gate system was successfully built, which also lead to a 2-to-1 encoder and a 1-to-2 decoder. On the same platform, a more complicated logic device, a half-adder, was also constructed. The present system combined electrocatalysis of natural DNA mediated by Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and multiple stimuli-responsive PNIPAM-DNA films together with simultaneously obtained CV and ECL signals as outputs, leading to the development of novel types of biocomputing systems.

AB Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), one of the most common mycotoxins in food matrixes, has been identified as the most toxic contaminant with mutagenic, teratogenic, immunosuppressive, and carcinogenic effects. In this work, a magnetically assembled aptasensing device has been designed for label-free determination of AFB1 by employing a disposable screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) covered with a designed polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film as the micro electrolytic cell. The magnetically controlled bio-probes were firstly prepared by immobilization of the thiolated aptamers on the Fe3O4@Au magnetic beads, which was rapidly assembled on the working electrode of SPCE within 10 s, by using a magnet placed at the opposite side. The PDMS film with a centered hole was covered on the SPCE surface to achieve a more practicable and flexible electrochemical measurement. In this effort, a label-free aptasensor for the sensitive and selective determination of AFB1 has been developed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy upon the biorecognition between aptamers and the targets. The developed method had a wide linear range of 20 pg mL(-1)-50 ng mL(-1) with a detection limit of 15 pg mL(-1) (S/N = 3) and succeeded in spiked samples of peanuts. The developed aptasensing device shows fantastic application prospect with simple design, easy operation, low cost, and high sensitivity and selectivity characteristics. This sensing strategy represents a promising path toward routine quality control of food safety and creates the opportunity to develop facile aptasensing device for other targets.

AB This work reports the development of a simple and cost-effective electrochemical sensor based on electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ErGO) bound to the surface of indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode through 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) monolayer (ITO/APTES/ErGO) for selective and sensitive detection of tyramine. The features of the modified electrode were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetr, (CV), and electrochemical impedance (EIS) methods. The analytical performance of the developed sensor was evaluated with respect to linear detection range, limit of detection, stability, coexistence interference and reproducibility. The modified device exhibited electrocatalytic activity toward tyramine oxidation within two linear concentration range of 1-100 nM, and 1-100 mu M, with LOD of 0.1 nM. Finally, the sensor successfully detected tyramine in commercially available real samples with satisfactory recovery ranges. The proposed modified sensor offers distinct advantages including low cost, simple handling, good sensitivity and high selectivity.

AB Herein, a novel dual-signal amplified photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor was successfully developed for the highly selective detection of N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) methylated RNA. The PEC biosensor comprised BiVO4-110-TiO2 heterojunction and gold nanoparticle decorated MoS2 (MoS2-AuNPs) as the photoactive materials, horseradish peroxidase conjugated biotin (HRP-Biotin) as the enzymatic unit, Ag+-mediated cytosine pairs (C-Ag+-C) as the signal amplification unit, and the anti-m(6)A antibody as the m(6)A methylated RNA recognition unit. Following immunoreaction between m(6)A and the anti-m(6)A antibody, the C-Ag+-C structure of the hairpin DNA unfolded, yielding the duplex strand DNA (dsDNA) and releasing Ag+ ions. Superoxide ions (O-2(-)) generated by the action of HRP on H2O2 then served as an electron donor, resulting in the deposition of Ag on AuNPs surface and resulting in an increased photocurrent. Based on this change f the photocurrent, m(6)A could be accurately assayed using this dual-signal amplified PEC biosensor. The biosensor showed high selectivity and a very low detection limit of 1.665 pM for m(6)A, and was successfully applied to evaluate the content change of m(6)A in leaves of maize seedling and chicken fetal hepatocytes samples after treatment with chemical mutagen of ethylmethane sulfonate and hormone of insulin, respectively.

AB A target-driven stochastic DNA walking electrochemical biosensor sensitized with gold nanocages@graphene nanoribbons (Au NCs@GNRs) was explored for sensitive detection of target DNA. Benefited from the large surface area and excellent conductivity of Au NCs and GNRs, the proposed sensing platform not only improved the electron transfer kinetics involved in electrochemical reactions, but also enhanced the loading capability for stem-loop structural DNA segment (H). Upon the addition of target DNA, the hairpin structure of H was opened and H:target DNA duplex was formed based on toehold-mediated DNA strand displacement. In the presence of exonuclease III (Exo III), the H:target DNA duplex was digested. As a result, target DNA spontaneously dissociated from H:target DNA duplex and then hybridized with another H strand. Therefore, the continuous locomotion of target DNA unceasingly triggered new digestion process from near to far along the electrode surface, resulting in great signal amplification. The proposed strategy exhibited excellent detection performances for DNA analysis in complex matrix such as human serum, which illuminated the practical application field of the sensing platform.

AB Cocaine is one of the most used illegal recreational drugs. Developing an on-site test for cocaine use detection has been a focus of research effort, since it is essential to the control and legal action against drug abuse. Currently most of cocaine detection methods are time-consuming and require special or expensive equipment, and the detection often suffers from high cross-reactivity with cocaine metabolites and relative low sensitivity with the best limit of detection reported at sub nanomolar (nM) level. In this work, an aptasensor has been developed using capacitive monitoring of sensor surface incorporating alternating current electrokinetics effects to speed up molecular transport and minimize matrix effects. The aptasensor is rapid, low cost, highly sensitive and specific as well as simple-to-use for the detection of cocaine from serum. The assay has a sample-to-result time of 30 s, a limit of detection of 7.8 fM, and a linear response for cocaine ranging from 14.5fM to 14.5pM in standard buffer, which are great improvements from other reported cocaine sensors. Special buffer is used for serum cocaine detection, and a limit of detection of 13.4 fM is experimentally demonstrated for cocaine spiked in human serum (equivalent to 1.34pM cocaine in neat serum). The specificity of the biosensor is also demonstrated with structurally similar chemicals, ecgonine ethyl ester and methylecgonidine. This biosensor shows high promise in detection of low levels of cocaine from complex matrices.

AB Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, often being treated with antineoplastic drugs that have high potential for toxicity to humans and the environment, even at very low concentrations. Therefore, monitoring these drugs is of utmost importance. Among the techniques used to detect substances at low concentrations, electrochemical sensors and biosensors have been noted for their practicality and low cost. This review brings, for the first time, a simplified outline of the main electrochemical sensors and biosensors developed for the analysis of antineoplastic drugs. The drugs analyzed and the methodology used for electrochemical sensing are described, as are the techniques used for drug quantification and the analytical performance of each sensor, highlighting the limit of detection (LOD), as well as the linear range of quantification (LR) for each system. Finally, we present a technological prospection on the development and use of electrochemical sensors and biosensors in the quantification of antineoplastic drugs. A search of international patent databases revealed no patents currently submitted under this topic, suggesting this is an area to be further explored. We also show that the use of these systems has been gaining prominence in recent years, and that the quantification of antineoplastic drugs using electrochemical techniques could bring great financial and health benefits.

AB Conventional mediated electrochemical biosensors for toxicity assessment were almost based on 'one-pot' principle, i.e., mediators and the under-test chemicals were mixed together in the same vessel. In this process, the electron mediator is assumed to be merely an electron acceptor and cannot react with under-test toxicants. Actually, some under-test pollutants (such as metal ions) could react with the electron mediators, thus affecting the detection accuracy and sensitivity of the sensors. It was also found that at least two other interference factors have been ignored in present 'one-pot' mediated electrochemical biosensor systems, i.e., (1) the electrochemical sensitivity of mediators to pH; and (2) the potential reactions between under-test chemicals and buffers and the consequent pH changes. In this study, the three ignored interference factors have been investigated systematically and demonstrated by significance tests. Moreover, a solving strategy, an isolation method, is proposed for fabrication of novel mediated electrochemical biosensor to avoid the interference factors existing at present mediated electrochemical biosensor. According to the testing results obtained from the isolation method, IC50 values of Cu2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Fe3+, Ni2+ and Cr3+ were 21.3 mg/L, 3.7 mg/L, 26.7 mg/L, 4.4 mg/L and 10.7 mg/L, respectively. The detection results of four real water samples also suggested this method could be applied for the practical and complex samples.

AB Label-free immunosensor based on tetra armed star-shaped poly(glycidylmethacrylate) (Star(PGMA)) modified disposable ITO electrode was developed for detection of p53 protein, an important colorectal cancer biomarker. This disposable biosensor was fabricated by spin-coating technique using star-shaped Star(PGMA) with epoxy side groups. After formation of a stable film with epoxy ends, anti-p53 antibodies were bound to these groups covalently. Stepwise modification of the electrode was followed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies. The electrochemical performance of the immunosensor was studied by EIS. Furthermore, the antibody and antigen coupling was monitored by single frequency impedance (SFI) technique. The immunosensor showed a low limit of detection (7 fg/mL) and a linear detection range between 0.02 pg/mL and 4 pg/mL. Additionally, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were utilized for monitoring of immunosensor surface at different stages of fabrication. The antibody coupling on the electrode surface was proved by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, the proposed immunosensor had good reproducibility and repeatability.

AB This work demonstrates the development of a gold screen-printed electrode (Au-SPE)-based biosensor modified with a molecularly imprinted polymer and amplified using antibody-conjugated nano-liposomes. The developed biosensor was utilized for dual determination of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as cancer biomarkers. To prepare this biosensor, Au-SPE was modified with 3,3'-dithiodipropionic acid di(N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) via self-assembly method and then the target proteins (EGFR and VEGF) were covalently attached to the modified SPE. To synthesize the molecularly imprinted polymer, monomers of acrylamide and N,N'-methylenebis(acrylamide) were polymerized around the EGFR and VEGF templates, and to characterize the prepared biosensor, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used for analyses of surface changes in the engineered electrodes.
   To produce reliable electrochemical signals, nano-liposomes which were loaded with Cd(II) and Cu(II) cations and decorated with antibodies specific for EGFR and VEGF were used as an efficient tool for detection of target biomarkers. In the analysis step, potentiometric striping analysis (PSA), as an electrochemical technique, was utilized for sensitive determination of these cations. The limits of detection (LODs) of EGFR and VEGF analyses were found to be 0.01 and 0.005 pg mL(-1) with the linear dynamic ranges (LDRs) of 0.05-50000 and 0.01-7000 pg mL(-1), respectively. Moreover, the proposed biosensor was successfully used for sensitive, reproducible, and specific detection of EGFR and VEGF in real samples. Due to the SPE nature of the developed biosensor, we envision that this sensing tool has capability of being integrated with lab-on-a-chip (LOC), microfluidics, and micro total analysis systems.

AB Synthetic enzyme-free DNA nanomachine performs quasi-mechanical movements in response to external intervention, suggesting the promise of constructing sensitive and specific biosensors. Herein, a smart DNA nanomachine biosensor for biomolecule (such as nucleic acid:thrombin and adenosine) detection is developed by target-assisted enzyme-free hairpin DNA cascade amplifier. The whole DNA nanomachine system is constructed on gold nanoparticle which decorated with hundreds of locked hairpin substrate strands serving as DNA tracks, and the DNA nanomachine could be activated by target molecule toehold-mediated exchange on gold nano particle surface, resulted in the fluorescence recovery of fluorophore. The process is repeated so that each copy of the target can open multiplex fluorophore-labeled hairpin substrate strands, resulted in amplification of the fluorescence signal. Compared with the conventional biosensors of catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) without substrate in solution, the DNA nanomachine could generate 2-3 orders of magnitude higher fluorescence signal. Furthermore, the DNA nanomachine could be used for nucleic acid, thrombin and adenosine highly sensitive specific detection based on isothermal, and homogeneous hairpin DNA cascade signal amplification in both buffer and a complicated biomatrix, and this kind of DNA nanomachine could be efficiently applied in the field of biomedical analysis.

AB 17 beta-estxadiol (17 beta-E2) plays a critical role in regulating reproduction in human, there is therefore an urgent need to detect it sensitively and precisely in a cost-effective and easy method. In this paper, a label-free integrated microfluidic paper-based analytical device was developed for highly sensitive electrochemical detection of 17 beta-E2. The microfluidic channel of the paper-based sensor was fabricated with wax printing and the three electrodes, including working, counter and reference electrode were screen-printed. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/thionine (THI)/gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) Nano composites were synthesized and coated on screen-printed working electrode (SPWE) for the immobilization of anti-E2. In this electro-chemical system of paper-based immunoassay, THI molecules serving as an electrochemical mediator while MWCNTs and AuNPs, due to their excellent electrical conductivities, could accelerate electron transfer for the signal amplification. Experimental results revealed that the immunoassay is able to detect 17 beta-E2 as low as 10 pg mL(-1), with a linear range from 0.01 to 100 ng mL(-1). This microfluidic paper-based immunosensor would provide a new platform for low cost, sensitive, specific, and point-of-care diagnosis of 17 beta-E2.

AB Photoactive material is one of the main challenges for fabrication of sensitive and selective photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor. Herein, a facile PEC sensor is constructed using graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (g-C3N4 NSs) coated on the surface of ITO electrode, where electron donor properties of potassium ferrocyanide and ascorbic acid is utilized for the tracing of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hypochlorite (CIO), and ascorbic acid (AA). Our designed PEC sensor exhibits a good linear range to H2O2 concentrations from 12.5 to 875 mu M in pH = 7.4 and 2.5-400 mu M in pH = 10, while that for AA is in the range from 0.25 to 100 mu M in pH = 7.4, and with the same pH for ClO center dot concentrations in the range from 0.5 to 19 x 10(-3)% (V/V) in a bleach sample. Owing to the good responses towards the traces of H2O2, AA, and ClO center dot, our designed system may be used as H2O2, ClO center dot, and AA sensor for outdoor applications with high specificity, long-time stability and good reproducibility.

AB In this work, we propose for the first time the use of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) nanoporous membranes for in situ monitoring of parathyroid hormone-like hormone (PTHLH) secretion in cultured human cells. The biosensing system is based on the nanochannels blockage upon immunocomplex formation, which is electrically monitored through the voltammetric oxidation of Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs). Models evaluated include a neuroblastoma cell line (SK-N-AS) and immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) as a control of high PTHLH production. The effect of total number of seeded cells and incubation time on the secreted PTHLH levels is assessed, finding that secreted PTHLH levels range from approximately 60 to 400 ng/mL. Moreover, our methodology is also applied to analyse PTHLH production following PTHLH gene knockdown upon transient cell transfection with a specific silencing RNA (siRNA). Given that inhibition of PTHLH secretion reduces cell proliferation, survival and invasiveness in a number of tumors, our system provides a powerful tool for the pre-clinical evaluation of therapies that regulate PTHLH production. This nanoporous membrane based sensing technology might be useful to monitor the active secretion of other proteins as well, thus contributing to characterize their regulation and function.

AB MXene-Ti3C2, as a new class of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides (or nitrides), has been synthesized by exfoliating pristine Ti3AlC2 phases with hydrofluoric acid. The SEM and XRD images show that the resultant MXene possesses a graphene-like 2D nanostructure. and the surface of MXene has been partially terminated with-OH, thus providing a favorable microenvironment for enzyme immobilization and retaining their bioactivity and stability. Considering the unique metallic conductivity, biocompatibility and good dispersion in aqueous phase, the as-prepared MXene was explored as a new matrix to immobilize tyrosinase (a model enzyme) for fabricating a mediator-free biosensor for ultrasensidve and rapid detection of phenol. The varying electrochemical measurements were used to investigate the electrochemical performance of MXene-based tyrosinase biosensors. The results revealed that the direct electron transfer between tyrosinase and electrode could be easily achieved via a surface-controlled electrochemical process. The fabricated MXene-based tyrosinase biosensors exhibited good analytical performance over a wide linear range from 0.05 to 15.5 mu mol L-1, with a low detection limit of 12 nmol L-1 and a sensitivity of 414.4 mA M-1. The proposed biosensing approach also demonstrated good repeatability, reproducibility, long-term stability and high recovery for phenol detection in real water samples. With those excellent performances, MXene with graphene-like structure is proved to be a robust and versatile electrochemical biosensing platform for enzyme-based biosensors and biocatalysis, and has wide potential applications in biomedical detection and environmental analysis.

AB Serotonin is one of the important neurotransmitters of our body. It's abnormal concentration is associated with multiple disorders and diseases. Sensitive and precise electrochemical determination of serotonin is not possible with bare working electrodes due to various reasons viz. electro-chemical fouling, presence of other biological molecules having similar oxidation potential, and lower concentration of serotonin in biological samples. Surface modification of working electrode is required for fast, precise, selective, and sensitive detection of serotonin. We have extensively reviewed the research approaches where serotonin has been sensitively detected using surface modified electrodes in the presence of other interfering agents. This review aims at presenting the electrochemical detection of serotonin using various surface modified electrodes such as glassy carbon, graphite, carbon fiber, diamond, screen printed, ITO, and metal electrodes modified with conducting polymers and polyelectrolytes, carbon nanomaterials, metal or metal oxide nanoparticles, biological compounds, and other conducting materials. The analytical figures of merits of various research approaches for detection of serotonin have been compared in the article. The properties of material used for surface modification, chemical interactions at the interfaces, and electrocatalytic effects of modified surfaces on sensing of serotonin have been thoroughly discussed in this review.

AB Monitoring cancer biomarkers in biological fluids has become a key tool for disease diagnosis, which should be of easy access anywhere in the world. The possibility of reducing basic requirements in the field of electrochemical biosensing may open doors in this direction. This work proposes for this purpose an innovative electrochemical immunosensing system using a photovoltaic cell as an electrical reading box. Immunosensing ensures accuracy, the electrochemical-ground of the device ensures sensitivity and detectability, and the photovoltaic cell drives the system towards electrical autonomy. As proof-of-concept, Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was used herein, a cancer biomarker of clinical relevance.
   In brief, a conductive glass with a fluorine doped tin oxide film was used as conductive support and modified with anti-CEA by means of a bottom-up approach. All stages involved in the biochemical modification of the FTO surface were followed by electrochemical techniques, namely electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. This electrode acted as counter electrode of a dye-sensitized solar cells, and the electrical output of this cell was monitored for the different concentrations of CEA. Under optimized conditions, the device displayed a linear behaviour against CEA concentration, from 5 pg/mL to 15 ng/mL. The immunosensor was applied to the analysis of CEA in urine from healthy individual and spiked with the antigen.
   Overall, the presented approach demonstrates that photovoltaic cells may be employed as an electrical reading box of electrochemical biosensors, yielding a new direction towards autonomous electrochemical biosensing.

   HISTORY
AB DNA methylation is considered to be a promising marker for the early diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. However, direct detection of the methylated DNAs in clinically relevant samples is still challenging because of its extremely low concentration (similar to fM). Here, an integrated microfluidic chip is reported, which is capable of pre-concentrating the methylated DNAs using ion concentration polarization (ICP) and electrochemically detecting the pre-concentrated DNAs on a single chip. The proposed chip is the first demonstration of an electrochemical detection of both level and concentration of the methylated DNAs by integrating a DNA pre-concentration unit without gene amplification. Using the proposed chip, 500 fM to 500 nM of methylated DNAs is pre-concentrated by almost 100-fold in 10 min, resulting in a drastic improvement of the electrochemical detection threshold down to the fM level. The proposed chip is able to measure not only the DNA concentration, but also the level of methylation using human urine sample by performing a consecutive electrochemical sensing on a chip. For clinical application, the level as well as the concentration of methylation of glutathione-S transferase-P1 (GSTP1) and EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (EFEMP1), which are known to be closely associated with prostate cancer diagnosis, are electrochemically detected in human urine spiked with these genes. The developed chip shows a limit of detection (LoD) of 7.9 pM for GSTP1 and 11.8 pM for EFEMP1 and is able to detect the level of methylation in a wide range from 10% to 100% with the concentration variation from 50 pM to 500 nM.

AB This study aimed to develop a more sensitive method for the detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) using heteroassembled gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). A single layered localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) chip format was developed with antigen-antibody reaction-based detection symmetry using AuNPs, which detected HBsAg at 10pg/mL. To further improve the detection limit, a modified detection format was fabricated by. fixing a secondary antibody (to form a heteroassembled sandwich format) to the AuNP monolayer, which enhanced the detection sensitivity by about 100, times. The developed heteroassembled AuNPs sandwich-immunoassay LSPR chip format was able to detect as little as 100 fg/mL of HBsAg within 10-15 min. In addition, the heteroassembled AuNPs sandwich-immunassay LSPR chip format did not show any non-specific binding to other tested antigens, including alpha fetoprotein (AFP), C-reactive protein (CRP), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). These findings confirm that the proposed detection strategy of heteroassembled AuNPs sandwich-immunoassay LSPR chip format may provide a new platform for early diagnosis of various human diseases.

AB miRNAs are short regulatory sequences that monitor gene expression at post-transcriptional level. miRNAs play outstanding roles in cellular processes and their altered expression or aberrant function has been reported in diseases such as cancer. Furthermore, some of them serve as biomarkers for prognosis, diagnosis, and prediction of drug effectiveness as well as probable utility in the field of personalized medicine. As a result, proper and sensitive detection of miRNAs is a crucial matter. Traditional approaches including Northern blotting, Microarray, and Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction have been extensively employed by means of miRNA detection for decades. However, these methods lack sufficient sensitivity, specificity and are labor intensive. In the recent years, DNAzyme-based assays have become strikingly attractive. The principal element in these techniques is a G-rich sequence, called the G-quadruplex, which turns into a DNAzyme with catalytic activity by addition of hemin, and subsequently allows simple and rapid detection of the target. In this review, different methods of miRNA detection, along with related advantages and disadvantages are discussed, with a special focus on DNAzymes and DNAzyme-derived methods.

AB Nanowire sensors offer great potential as highly sensitive electrochemical and electronic biosensors because of their small size, high aspect ratios, and electronic properties. Nevertheless, the available methods to fabricate carbon nanowires in a controlled manner remain limited to expensive techniques. This paper presents a simple fabrication technique for sub-100 nm suspended carbon nanowire sensors by integrating electrospinning and photolithography techniques. Carbon Microelectromechanical Systems (C-MEMS) fabrication techniques allow fabrication of high aspect ratio carbon structures by patterning photoresist polymers into desired shapes and subsequent carbonization of resultant structures by pyrolysis. In our sensor platform, suspended nanowires were deposited by electrospinning while photolithography was used to fabricate support structures. We have achieved suspended carbon nanowires with sub-100 nm diameters in this study. The sensor platform was then integrated with a microfluidic chip to form a lab-on-chip device for label-free chemiresistive biosensing. We have investigated this nanoelectronics label-free biosensor's performance towards bacterial sensing by functionalization with Salmonella-specific aptamer probes. The device was tested with varying concentrations of Salmonella Typhimurium to evaluate sensitivity and various other bacteria to investigate specificity. The results showed that the sensor is highly specific and sensitive in detection of Salmonella with a detection limit of 10 CFU mL(-1) Moreover, this proposed chemiresistive assay has a reduced turnaround time of 5 min and sample volume requirement of 5 pi which are much less than reported in the literature.

AB The development of high-efficient technologies for cancer biomarkers detection has attracted tremendous research effort for its great clinic significance. In this work, we designed a new type of flexible and robust nanohybrid microelectrode by modifying carbon fiber with dual nanoenzyme, Le., AuPd alloy nanoparticles (AuPdANPs) decorated graphene quantum dots (GQDs) assembly, and explored its practical application in electrochemical sensing system for sensitive detection of cancer biomarker hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in human breast cancer cells and tissue. For the preparation of dual nanoenzyme modified microelectrode, ionic liquid was used as the electrolyte for the effective electrodeposition of GQDs on carbon fiber substrate to form a close-packed assembly under a very negative potential, then the highly dense AuPd-ANPs were uniformly decorated on GQDs assembly by electrodeposition. In virtue of the structural merits and synergistic contribution of dual nanoenzyme in enhancing the electrocatalytic activity to H2O2, the resultant nanohybrid microelectrode exhibited good sensing performances for electrochemical detection of H2O2, including a high sensitivity of 371 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1), a wide linear range from 1.0 mu M to 18.44 mM, a low detection limit of 500 nM (a signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1), as well as good selectivity and biocompatibility, which could be used for real-time tracking H2O2 released from different types of human breast cells and in situ sensitive detection of H2O2 in clinical breast cancer tissue.

AB This work designed an artificial substrate peptide to synthesize peptide-hemin/G-quadruplex (peptide-DNAzyme) conjugates. In addition to enhancing catalytic activity of hemin/G-quadruplex, the peptide could also be induced and cleaved by prostate specific antigen (PSA). It was the first report on peptide-DNAzyme conjugates in application of the peptide biosensor. The polyethyleneimine-reduced graphene oxide@hollow platinum nanotubes (PEI-rGO@PtNTs) nanocomposites were cast on the glassy carbon electrode in order to form the interface of biocompatibility and huge surface area for bioprobes immobilization. In absence of PSA, the peptide-DNAzyme conjugates retained intact on the surface of the electrode to produce a strong response signal. But in presence of PSA, the peptide-DNAzyme conjugates were destroyed to release electron mediators, resulting in dramatical decrease of the electrochemicl signal. Therefore, the method had high sensitivity and super selectivity with the limit of detection calculated as 2.0 fg/mL. Furthermore, the strategy would be promising to apply for other proteases by transforming the synthetic peptide module of target.

AB The fabrication of a novel, and highly selective electrochemical sensor,based on a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) modified laser scribed graphene (LSG), and detection of dopamine (DA) in the presence Of ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA) is described. LSG electrodes were produced with a 3-dimensional macro porous network and large electrochemically-active surface area via direct laser writing on polyimide sheets. PEDOT was electrodeposited on the LSG electrode, and the physical properties of the obtained films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray diffraction microanalysis (EDAX). The modified electrodes were applied for the determination of DA in the presence of AA and UA using cyclic voltammetry (CV), and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques. The linear range for dopamine detection was found to be 1-150 mu M with a sensitivity of 0.220 +/- 0.011 mu A mu M-1 and a detection limit of 0.33 mu M; superior values to those obtained without PEDOT. For the first time, PEDOT-modified LSG have been fabricated and assessed for high-performance dopamine sensing using cost-effective, disposable electrodes, with potential for development in further sensing applications.

AB Sensor-laden wearable systems that are capable of providing continuous measurement of key physiological parameters coupled with data storage, drug delivery and feedback therapy have attracted huge interest. Here we report a stretchable wireless system for sweat pH monitoring, which is able to withstand up to 53% uniaxial strain and more than 500 cycles to 30% strain. The stretchability of the pH sensor patch is provided by a pair of serpentine-shaped stretchable interconnects. The pH sensing electrode is made of graphite-polyurethane composite, which is suitable for biosensor application. The sensing patch validated through in-depth electrochemical studies, exhibits a pH sensitivity of 11.13 +/- 5.8 mV/pH with a maximum response time of 8 s. Interference study of ions and analyte (Na+, K+ and glucose) in test solutions shows negligible influence on the pH sensor performance. The pH data can be wirelessly and continuously transmitted to smartphone through a stretchable radio-frequency-identification antenna, of which the radiating performance is stable under 20% strain, as proved by vector network analyzer measurement. To evaluate the full system, the pH value of a human sweat equivalent solution has been measured and wirelessly transmitted to a custom-developed smart phone App.

AB This study addresses the rational design of a magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer (magnetic-MIP) for the selective recognition of the hormone levothyroxine. The theoretical study was carried out by the density functional theory (DFT) computations considering dispersion interaction energies, and using the D2 Grimme's correction. The B97-D/def2-SV(P)/PCM method is used not only for studying the structure of the template the and monomer-monomer interactions, but also to assess the stoichiometry, noncovalent binding energies, solvation effects and thermodynamics properties such as binding energy. Among the 13 monomers studied in silico, itaconic acid is the most suitable according to the thermodynamic values. In order to assess the efficiency of the computational study, three different magnetic-MIPs based on itaconic acid, acrylic acid and acrylamide were synthesized and experimentally compared. The theoretical results are in agreement with experimental binding studies based on laser confocal microscopy, magneto-actuated immunoassay and electrochemical sensing. Furthermore, and for the first time, the direct electrochemical sensing of L-thyroxine preconcentrated on magnetic-MIP was successfully performed on magneto-actuated electrodes within 30 min with a limit of detection of as low as 0.0356 ng mL(-1) which cover the clinical range of total L-thyroxine. Finally, the main analytical features were compared with the gold standard method based on commercial competitive immunoassays. This work provides a thoughtful strategy for magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer design, synthesis and application, opening new perspectives in the integration of these materials in magneto-actuated approaches for replacing specific antibodies in biosensors and microfluidic devices.

AB The development of highly specific and ultrasensitive fluorescent probes for tracking basal mitochondrial hypochlorite is very important to unravel its diverse cellular functions in the mitochondria of living cells. In this paper, we have developed a water-soluble, mitochondria-targeted near-infrared fluorescent probe NB-OCl for selectively measuring OCl center dot in the presence of higher concentration (500 mu M) other biologically important substances. Surprisingly, the obtained results demonstrated that probe NB-OCl could sensitively determine OCl center dot in the range of 0-200 pM with the detection limit of 10.8 pM. To the best of our knowledge, NB-OCl is the first fluorescent probe for the specific determination of OCl center dot at the picomolar level. Moreover, probe NB-OCl exhibits a fast response for OCl center dot (<5 s), which would be in favor of tracking the highly reactive and short-lived OCl center dot in the living systems. The preeminent recognition properties of probe NB-OCl enable its applications in the monitoring of basal OCl center dot and the fluctuations of endogenous/exogenous OCl center dot levels in the mitochondria of living cells.

AB The rapid growth of point-of-care tests demands for biosensors with high sensitivity and small size. This paper demonstrates an optofluidic metasurface that combines silicon-on-insulator (SOI) nanophotonics and nano-fluidics to realize a high-performance, lateral flow-through biosensor. The metasurface is made of a periodic array of silicon nanoposts on an SOI substrate, and functionalized with specific receptor molecules. Bonding of a polydimethylsiloxane slab directly onto the surface results in an ultracompact biosensor, where analyte solutions are restricted to flow only in the space between the nanoposts. No flow exists above the nanoposts. This sensor design overcomes the issue with diffusion-limited detection of many other biosensors. The lateral flow-through feature, in conjunction with high-Q resonance modes associated with optical bound states of the metasurface, offers an improved sensitivity to subtle molecule-bonding induced changes in refractive index. The device exhibits a resonance mode around 1550 nm wavelength and provides an index sensitivity of 720 nm/RIU. Biosensing is conducted to detect the epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ErbB2), a protein biomarker for early stage breast cancer screening, by monitoring resonance wavelength shifts in response to specific analyte-ligand binding events at the metasurface. The limit of detection of the device is 0.7 ng mL(-1) for ErbB2.

AB In this study, on the basis of hierarchical CuInS2-based heterostructure, a novel cathodic photoelectrochemical (PEC) enzymatic bioanalysis of the sarcosine detection was reported. Specifically, heterostructured CuInS2/NiO/ITO photocathode was prepared and sarcosine oxidases (SOx) were integrated for the construction of the enzymatic biosensor. In the bioanalysis, the O-2-dependent suppression of the cathodic photocurrent can be observed due to the competition between the as-fabricated O-2-sensitive photocathode and the SOx-catalytic event toward O-2 reduction. Based on the sarcosine-controlled O-2 concentration, a novel photocathodic enzymatic biosensor could be realized for the sensitive and specific sarcosine detection. This work manifested the great potential of CuInS2-based heterostructure as a novel platform for future PEC bioanalytical development and also a PEC method for sarcosine detection, which could be easily extended to numerous other enzymatic systems and to our knowledge has not been reported. This work is expected to stimulate more interest in the design and implementation of numerous CuInS2-based heterostructured photocathodic enzymatic sensing.

AB Silver-dendrimer nanocomposites were synthesized and used as oligonucleotide labels for electrochemical stripping detection of DNA hybridization. The synthesized silver-dendrimer nanocomposites were characterized by UV-vis spectrophotometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Ratios of silver/dendrimer were optimized in order to obtain stable nanocomposites with maximal silver loading in the interior of a polymeric shell. The silver-dendrimer nanocomposites were attached to sequence-known DNA probes specific to colitoxin, and used to detect probe hybridization by dissolution of the silver nanoparticles in the interior of dendrimer in a diluted nitric acid, followed by measurement of Ag+ ions by anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). Use of differential pulse voltammetry for the stripping step, along with optimization of the ASV conditions, enabled a detection limit of 0.78 pM. The present strategy, in combination with dendrimer-encapsulated copper labeled oligonucleotides probe reported previously, could potentially be used to detect single or multiple DNA targets in one sample.

AB The development of nucleic acid-based portable platforms for the real-time analysis of diseases has attracted considerable scientific and commercial interest. Recently, 2D layered molybdenum sulfide (2D MoS2 from here on) nanosheets have shown great potential for the development of next-generation platforms for efficient signal transduction. Through combination with DNA as a biorecognition medium, MoS2 nanostructures have opened new opportunities to design and construct highly sensitive, specific, and commercially viable sensing devices. The use of specific short ssDNA sequences like aptamers has been proven to bind well with the unique transduction properties of 2D MoS2 nanosheets to realize aptasensing devices. Such sensors can be operated on the principles of fluorescence, electro-cheumuluminescence, and electrochemistry with many advantageous features (e.g., robust biointerfacing through various conjugation chemistries, facile sensor assembly, high stability with regard to temperature/pH, and high affinity to target). This review encompasses the state of the art information on various design tactics and working principles of MoS2/DNA sensor technology which is emerging as one of the most sought-after and valuable fields with the advent of nucleic acid inspired devices. To help achieve a new milestone in biosensing applications, great potential of this emerging technique is described further with regard to sensitivity, specificity, operational convenience, and versatility.

AB Here we innovate a portable and quantitative immunochromatographic assay (ICA) with a personal glucose meter (PGM) as readout for the detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coil O157:H7). The carboxyl group coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles (MNPs) were synthesized by a one pot method and used as carriers of invertase and monoclonal antibody against E. coli O157:H7. Initially, the invertase and antibody double functionalized MNPs (Invertase-MNPs-IgG) conjugates were prepared and used as label probe in this assay system. Before laminating onto the baking card, the absorbent pad was soaked in sucrose solution and desiccated. MNPs produced brown band at the detection zone of the ICA when acting as direct labels. As they were also coupled with invertase, the invertase catalyzed the hydrolysis of sucrose on the absorbent pad into glucose, which was detected by the PGM. To increase the sensitivity, antibody functionalized MNPs were used to enrich E. coli O157:H7 from sample solution. The innovative aspect of this approach lies in the visualization and quantification of E. coli O157:H7 through Invertase-MNPs-IgG and the detection of glucose concentration using PGM. Although the feasibility is demonstrated using E. coli O157:H7 as a model analyte, this approach can be easily developed to be a universal analysis system and applied to detection of a wide variety of foodbome pathogens and protein biomarkers. This study proposed a qualitative and quantitative analysis device for the clinic diagnostics and food safety analysis.

AB In this study nickel nanoclusters (NiNCs), was promised as novel and economic electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emitter for highly sensitive and selective determination of creatinine in the presence of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP). The uniform magnetic graphene oxide (GO-Fe3O4) MIP film was established on the surface of ITO electrode and Ni NCs-embedded in MIP, showed a strong anodic ECL emission using tri-n-propylamine (TPrA) as coreactant. During the ECL process, TPrA was oxidized, and Ni NCs got the energy to generate excited state Ni NCs* for light emission. When the imprinted cavities were occupied by creatinine, the ECL emission of Ni NCs on the MIP-modified electrode surface was efficiently quenched. Under optimal conditions, the proposed sensor demonstrated ultrasensitive and accurate analytical performance toward creatinine detection with a linear range from 5 nM to 1 mM and detection limit of 0.5 nM (S/N = 3). The biosensor showed good specificity for creatinine determination compared to other compounds that having the chemical structure analogue or close to the template creatinine, when the concentration ratio of interference to creatinine was more than 100 times. Furthermore, the biosensor was successfully applied to determination of creatinine in human serum and urine samples with satisfactory results. So, this assay for creatinine detection possesses high sensitivity, good selectivity, excellent reproducibility and stability. We expect the combination of molecular imprinting system with ECL assay in the presence of Ni NCs as a new type of superior luminophore candidate can be developed for design of ultrasensitive sensors, biosensors and other measuring devices.

AB We developed an electrochemical redox cycling-based immunosensor using a 3D carbon system consisting of a suspended mesh and substrate-bound interdigitated array (IDA) nanoelectrodes. The carbon structures were fabricated using a simple, cost-effective, and reproducible microfabricatlon technology known as carbon microelectromechanical systems (C-MEMS). We demonstrated that the 3D sub-micrometer-sized mesh architecture and selective modification of the suspended mesh facilitated the efficient production of large quantities of electrochemical redox species. The electrochemically active surfaces and small size of IDA nanoelectrodes with a 1:1 aspect ratio exhibited high signal amplification resulting from efficient redox cycling of electrochemical species (PAP/PQI) by a factor of similar to 25. The proposed selective surface modification scheme facilitated efficient redox cycling and exhibited a linear detection range of 0.001-100 ng/mL for cardiac myoglobin (cMyo). The specific detection of cMyo was also achieved in the presence of other interfering species. Moreover, the proposed 3D carbon system-based immunosensor successfully detected as low as similar to 0.4 pg/mL cMyo in phosphate-buffered saline and human serum.

AB In enzymatic fuel cells (EnFCs), hydrogen peroxide formation is one of the main problems when enzymes, such as, glucose oxidase (GOx) is used due to the conversion of oxygen to hydrogen peroxide in the catalytic reaction. To address this problem, we here report the first demonstration of an EnFC using a variant of pyranose-2-oxidase (P2O-T169G) which has been shown to have low activity towards oxygen. A simple and biocompatible immobilisation approach incorporating multi-walled-carbon nanotubes within ferrocene (Fc)-Nafion film was implemented to construct EnFCs. Successful immobilisation of the enzymes was demonstrated showing 3.2 and 1.7-fold higher current than when P2O-T169G and GOx were used in solution, respectively. P2O-T169G showed 25% higher power output (maximum power density value of 8.45 +/- 1.6 mu W cm(-2)) and better stability than GOx in aerated glucose solutions. P2O-T169G maintained >70% of its initial current whereas GOx lost activity >90% during the first hour of 12 h operation at 0.15 V (vs Ag/Ag+). A different fuel cell configuration using gas diffusion cathode and carbon paper electrodes were used to improve the power output of the fuel cell to 29.8 +/- 6.1 mu W cm(-2). This study suggests that P2O-T169G with low oxygen activity could be a promising anode biocatalyst for EnFC applications.

AB MicroRNAs play crucial role in regulating gene expression in organism, thus it is very necessary to exploit an efficient method for the sensitive and specific detection of microRNA. Herein, a signal-on electrochemiluminescence biosensor was fabricated for microRNA-319a detection based on two-stage isothermal strand-displacement polymerase reaction (ISDPR). In the presence of target microRNA, amounts of trigger DNA could be generated by the first ISDPR. Then, the trigger DNA and the primer hybridized simultaneously with the hairpin probe to open the stem of the probe, and then the ECL signal will be emitted. In the presence of phi29 DNA polymerase and dNTPs, the trigger DNA could be displaced to initiate a new cycle which was the second ISDPR. Due to the two-stage amplification, this method presented excellent detection sensitivity with a low detection limit of 0.14 fM. Moreover, the applicability of the developed method was demonstrated by detecting the change of microRNA-319a content in the leaves of rice seedlings after the rice seeds were incubated with chemical mutagen of ethyl methanesulfonate.

AB In this report, a facile, efficient and low cost electrochemical sensor based on bimetallic Au-Cu nanoparticles supported on P nanozeolite modified carbon paste electrode (Au-Cu/NPZ/CPE) was constructed and its efficiency for determination of hydrazine in trace level was studied. For this purpose, agro waste material, stem sweep ash (SSA) was employed as the starting material (silica source) for the synthesis of nano P zeolite (NPZ). After characterization of the synthesized NPZ by analytical instruments (scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy), construction of Au-Cu/NPZ/CPE was performed by three steps procedure involving preparation of nano P zeolite modified carbon paste electrode (NPZ/CPE), introducing Cu+2 ions into nano zeolite structure by ion exchange and electrochemical reduction of Cu+2 ions upon applying constant potential. This procedure is followed by partial replacement of Cu by Au due to galvanic replacement reaction (GRR). The electrochemical properties of hydrazine at the surface of Au-Cu/NPZ/CPE was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), amperometry, and chronoamperometry methods in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS). It was found that the prepared sensor has higher electrocatalytic activity at a relatively lower potential compared to other modified electrodes including Au/NPZ/CPE, Cu/NPZ/CPE, Au-Cu/CPE and etc. Moreover, the proposed electrochemical sensor presented the favorable analytical properties for determination of hydrazine such as low detection limit (0.04 mu M), rapid response time (3 s), wide linear range (0.01-150 mM), and high sensitivity (99.53 mu A mM(-1)) that are related to the synergic effect of bimetallic of Au-Cu, porous structure and enough surface area of NPZ. In addition, capability of Au-Cu/NPZ/CPE sensor was successfully tested in real samples with good accuracy and precision.

AB To overcome the drawbacks such as low automation and high cost, an approach for cell viability online detection is proposed, based on the extracted lensfree cell diffraction fingerprint characteristics. The cell fingerprints are acquired by a constructed large field-of-view (FOV) diffraction imaging platform without any lenses. The approach realizes distinguishing live and dead cells online and calculating cell viability index based on the number of live cells. With theoretical analysis and simulation, diffraction fingerprints of cells with different morphology are simulated and two characteristics are discovered to be able to reflect cell viability status effectively. Two parameters, fringe intensity contrast (FIC) and fringe dispersion (FD), are defined to quantify these two characteristics. They are verified to be reliable to identify live cells. In a cytotoxicity assay of different methyl mercury concentration on BRL cells, the proposed approach is used to detect cell viability. MTT method is also employed and the results of correlational analysis and Bland-Altman analysis prove the validity of the proposed approach. By comparison, it can be revealed that the proposed approach has some advantages over other present techniques. Therefore it may be widely used as a cell viability measurement method in drug screening, nutritional investigation and cell toxicology studies.

AB Influenza is a viral infectious disease considered as a source of many health problems and enormous socioeconomic disruptions. Conventional methods are inadequate for in-field detection of the virus and generally suffer from being laborious and time-consuming. Thus, studies aiming to develop effective alternatives to conventional methods are urgently needed. In this work, we developed an approach for the isolation and detection of influenza A virus subtype H9N2. For this aim, two specific influenza receptors were used. The first, anti-matrix protein 2 (M2) antibody, was attached to iron magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and used for the isolation of the virus from allantoic fluid. The second biomolecule, Fetuin A, was attached to an electrochemical detectable label, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and used to detect the virus tacking advantage from fetuin-hemagglutinin interaction. The MNP-Influenza virus-AuNP formed complex was isolated and treated by an acid solution then the collected gold nanoparticles were deposited onto a screen printed carbon electrode. AuNPs catalyzes the hydrogen ions reduction in acidic medium while applying an appropriate potential, and the generated current signal was proportional to the virus titer. This approach allows the rapid detection of influenza virus A/H9N2 at a less than 16 HAU titer.

AB In this work, a nanocomposite of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), carbon nano-onions (CNOs), single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and chitosan (CS) (AuNPs/CNOs/SWCNTs/CS) was prepared for the development of highly sensitive electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), clinical tumor marker. Firstly, layer-by-layer fabrication of the CEA-immunosensors was studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV). By combining the advantages of large surface area and electronic properties of AuNPs, CNOs, SWCNTs, and film forming properties of CS, AuNPs/CNOs/SWCNTs/CS-nanocomposite-modified glassy carbon electrode showed a 200% increase in effective surface area and electronic conductivity. The calibration plot gave a negative linear relationship between log[concentration] of CEA and electrical current with a correlation coefficient of 0.9875. The CEA-immunosensor demonstrated a wide linear detection range of 100 fg mL(-1) to 400 ng mL(-1) with a low detection limit of 100 fg mL(-1). In addition to high sensitivity, reproducibility and large stability, CEA-immunosensor provided an excellent selectivity and resistant-to-interference in the presence of other antigens in serum and hence a potential to be used with real samples.

AB Continued risk assessment by evaluating cardiac biomarkers in healthy and unhealthy individuals can lower the mortality rate of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In this research, we have developed a hand-held biosensor system to rapidly screen for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) from a single drop of whole blood. The sensor methodology is based on extended gate design of electrical double layer (EDL) field effect transistor (FET), that can directly detect BNP in whole blood, without extensive sample pre-treatments, thereby eliminating the limitations of charge screening in high ionic strength solutions. A simple sensor array chip is fabricated to integrate with the MOSFET sensor system. Sensing characteristics are elucidated using purified BNP samples in 1 x PBS (with 4% BSA), spiked BNP samples in whole blood and clinical whole blood samples. The blood cells can be gravitationally separated without the use of any external actuation. The sensor exhibits very high sensitivity over wide dynamic range of detection. The sensing characteristics are not adversely affected by the presence of background proteins or blood cells, even without gravitational blood cell separation. Thus, the biosensor system can allow users to perform rapid whole blood diagnostics with minimal user protocols, in 5 min. The features of high sensitivity, cost-effectiveness and convenience of usage empower this technology to revolutionize the mobile diagnostics and healthcare industry.

AB A novel photoelectrochemical (PEC) aptasensor based on cerium (Ce) doped CdS modified graphene (G)/BiYWO6 was designed, which exhibits enhanced PEC intensity compared with pure BiYWO6, G/BiYWO3 and BiYWO6/Ce:CdS. In this scenario, ascorbic acid (AA) was exploited as an efficient and non-poisonous electron donor for scavenging photogenerated holes. The doping of Ce in CdS promoted its visible light absorption range and facilitated the charge transfer rate as well as hindered the h(+)/e(-) recombination. Moreover, the combination of G further promoted the electron carrier separation and transfer process due to its excellent electron collection and shuttling characteristic. Thus, the G/BiYWO6/Ce:CdS heterostructure was successfully served as a matrix for the PEC detection of tetracycline (Tc) at 0 V (vs Hg/Hg2Cl2). Under optimal conditions, the PEC aptasensor could offer a sensitive and specific detection limit (3 S/N) of Tc down to 0.01 ng/mL, as well as acceptable reproducibility, selectivity and storage stability, which opened up a promising pathway for the development of PEC biosensors.

AB A novel label-free photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor based on graphene quantum dots doped with nitrogen and sulfur (N,S-GQDs) and CdS co-sensitized hierarchical Zn2SnO4 cube was fabricated to detect cardiac troponin I (cTnI). The unique hierarchical Zn2SnO4 cube was synthesized successfully by the solvothermal method, which has a large specific surface to load functional materials. N,S-GQDs nanoparticles were assembled to the surface of cubic Zn2SnO4 coated ITO electrode, which efficiently accelerated the electronic transition and improved photo to-current conversion efficiency. Then, CdS nanoparticles further were modified by in-situ growth method to form Zn2SnO4/N,S-GQDs/CdS composite with prominent photocurrent, which was 30 times that of the Zn2SnO4 cube alone. In this work, the specific immune recognition between cTnI antigens and cTnI antibodies (anti-cTnI) reduced the intensity of the photoelectric signal. And the intensity decreased linearly with the logarithm of cTnI concentration range from 0.001 ng/mL to 50 ng/mL with a detection limit of 0.3 pg/mL. With high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, good stability and reproducibility, the fabricated PEC sensor showed promising applications in the sensor, clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction and PEC analysis.

AB Facile synthesis of ultrathin two-dimensional metallic nanosheets with special physical and chemical properties is still challenging. In this work, ultrathin silver nanosheets were synthesized through the galvanic replacement reaction between silver nitrate and Cu microcages without using any surfactant at room temperature. The as prepared Ag nanosheets (NSs) were concave and had a thickness of sub-10 nm. And the nanosheets exhibited excellent H2O2 detection property with a high sensitivity of about 320.3 uA mM(-1) cm(-2) and a low detection limit of 0.17 mu M in a wide linear range of 5-6000 mu A, and a fast response time (less than 2 s). Besides, the real-time detection of H2O2 induced from living HeLa and SH-SY5Y cells were also achieved, indicating the potential application of as-prepared Ag NSs in monitoring physiological and dynamic in-clinic pathological processes.

AB This paper presents the demonstration of on-chip fabrication of a potassium-selective sensor array enabled by electrowetting on dielectric digital microfluidics for the first time. This demonstration proves the concept that electrochemical sensors can be seamlessly integrated with sample preparation units in a digital microfluidic platform. More significantly, the successful on-chip fabrication of a sensor array indicates that sensors become reconfigurable and have longer lifetime in a digital microfluidic platform. The on-chip fabrication of ion-selective electrodes includes electroplating Ag followed by forming AgCl layer by chemical oxidation and depositing a thin layer of desired polymer-based ion selective membrane on one of the sensor electrodes. In this study, potassium ionophores work as potassium ion channels and make the membrane selective to potassium ions. This selectiveness results in the voltage difference across the membrane layer, which is correlated with potassium ion concentration. The calibration curve of the fabricated potassium-selective electrode demonstrates the slope of 58 mV/dec for potassium concentration in KCI sample solutions and shows good agreement with the ideal Nernstian response. The proposed sensor platform is an outstanding candidate for a portable home-use for continuous monitoring of ions thanks to its advantages such as easy automation of sample preparation and detection processes, elongated sensor lifetime, minimal membrane and sample consumption, and user-definable/reconfigurable sensor array.

AB Graphitic carbon nitride/bismuth ferrite nanocomposites (g-C3N4/BiFeO3 NCs) were synthesized by a facile one step sol-gel combustion method and employed as a peroxidase-like catalyst. Based on the catalytical activity on the luminol-H2O2 reaction, the nanocomposites were utilized as a colorimetric/chemiluminescent dual-readout immunochromatographic assay (ICA) for the multiplexed detection of pesticide residues by utilizing chlorpyrifos and carbaryl as the model analytes. In the proposed protocol, chlorpyrifos antibody and carbaryl antibody were tagged to g-C3N4/BiFeO3 NCs for developing the spatially-resolved multianalyte ICA. After two competitive immunoreactions completed on the ICA test strip, the tracer antibodies were captured by the immobilized antigens on two test lines. The accumulation of g-C3N4/BiFeO3 NCs led to the appearance of brown color, which were observed as a colorimetric and semi-quantitative signal. Furthermore, the g-C3N4/BiFeO3 NCs-driven generation of CL signal was collected as a sensitively quantitative signal after initiating the luminol-H2O2 reaction on the test lines. Under the optimal conditions, the limits of detection of chlorpyrifos and carbaryl were both 0.033 ng/mL. The dual-readout ICA was successfully used to detect chlorpyrifos and carbaryl spiked in environmental water and traditional Chinese medicine samples with acceptable recovery values of 80-119% and 90-118%. Due to many advantages including low cost, time efficiency, high sensitivity and good portability, the novel ICA showed great potential in many areas such as drug safety, environmental monitoring and clinical diagnosis.

AB In this work, a sensitive potentiometric resolved ratiometric photoelectrochemical aptasensor for Escherichia coli (E. coli detection was successfully fabricated with non-metallic nanomaterials. To avoid the use of precious metals or heavy metals, three-dimensional graphene hydrogel-loaded carbon quantum dots (C-dots/3DGH) and graphene-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with excellent PEC activity and matched potential were prepared. These two materials were modified onto two adjacent areas on the ITO electrode. By applying different bias voltage, the cathodic current generated by C-dots/3DGH and the anodic current generated by g-C3N4 can be clearly distinguished and would not interfere with one another. Then E. coli aptamer was modified onto the surface of C-dots/3DGH. In the presence of targets, the binding of E. coli with aptamer lead to the steric hindrance greatly increased and the cathodic current decreased significantly. Meanwhile, the anodic current generated by g-C3N4 was not influenced and it can serve as a stable reference to evaluate the environmental factors. Therefore, the concentration of E. coli can be quantified by the ratio of cathodic current to anodic current, which can effectively eliminate these analyte-independent factors and provide a more precise analysis. In addition, this ratiometric PEC biosensor also showed a good sensitivity and a wide linear range (2.9 cfu/mL to 2.9 x 10(6) cfu/mL).

AB An ultrasensitive and stable "dual-potential" ratiometric electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensor is reported for specific DNA, the femtomolar detection limit (0.12 fM, S/N = 3) and high selectivity insure its potential applications in cancer biomarkers searching or monitoring. The excellent performance of the sensor comes from simultaneously fabricated layer by layer structure "target DNA + Hemin / Au-Luminol NPs / DNA* / sl DNA / TGA / QDs / MWNTs / GCE" mode which was based on the enhancing effect of luminol by G-quadruplex / hemin and Au nanoparticles and the quenching effect of CdSe/ZnS by G-quadruplex / hemin. (i) DNA-SH could combine with Au-Luminol NPs via S-Au bond to solve the problem of poor solubility and weak ECL intensity of luminol in neutral medium. (ii) Target DNA and Hemin formed the G-quadruplex / hemin peroxidase mimicking DNAzyme could enhance the ECL of luminol and quench the ECL of CdSe/ZnS simultaneously. (iii) DNA* was employed to increase a certain distance between CdSe/ZnS and Au-Luminol for enhancing the CdSe/ZnS QDs initial ECL intensity. The dual-potential ratiometric mode lower the influence of background and side reaction of the ECL sensor which were the most important factors in trace sensing.

AB A highly sensitive electrochemical sensor using a carbon paste electrode (CPE) modified with surface molecularly imprinted polymeric microspheres (SMIPMs) was developed for methyl parathion (MP) detection. Molecular imprinting technique based on distillation precipitation polymerization was applied to prepare SMIPMs and non-surface imprinted microspheres (MIPMs). The polymer properties including morphology, size distribution, BET specific surface area and adsorption performance were investigated and compared carefully. Both MIPMs and SMIPMs were adopted to prepare CPE sensors and their electrochemical behaviors were characterized via cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Compared with MIPMs packed sensor, SMIPMs/CPE exhibits a higher sensing response towards MP with linear detection range of 1 x 10(-12)-8 x 10(-9) mol L-1 and detection limit of 3.4 x 10(-13) mol L-1 (S/N = 3). Moreover, SMIPMs/CPE exhibits good selectivity and stability in multiple-cycle usage and after long-time storage. Finally, the developed sensor was used to determine MP in real samples including soil and vegetables and only simple pretreatment is needed. The detection results were consistent with those obtained from liquid chromatography. Collectively, this newly developed sensor system shows significant potential for use in a variety of fields like food safety, drug residue determination and environmental monitoring.

AB Assesment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status is a key factor prompting definitive treatment decisions that help in reducing mortality rates associated with breast cancer. In this article, highly sensitive and low-cost impedimetric immunosensor using single-chain fragment variable antibody fragments was developed for quantitative detection of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 from serum employing gold nano particle-modified disposable screen-printed carbon electrodes. The gold nanoparticles facilitate fast electron transfer and offer a biocompatible surface for immobilization of small antibody fragments in an oriented manner, resulting in improved antigen binding efficiency. The single-chain fragment variable antibody fragment-modified screen printed immunosensor exhibits wide dynamic range of 0.01-100 ng mL(-1) and detection limit of 0.01 ng mL(-1) The advantages offered by this platform in terms of high sensitivity, broad dynamic range and low-cost demonstrates great potential for improved monitoring of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 levels for the management of breast and other cancers.

AB Millions of premature deaths per year from cardiovascular diseases represent a global threat urging governments to increase global initiatives, as advised by World Health Organization. In particular, together with prevention and management of risk factors, the development of portable platforms for early diagnosis of cardiovascular disorders appears a fundamental task to carry out. Contemporary assays demonstrated very good accuracy for diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but they are based on expensive and fragile capture antibodies. Accordingly, also considering the massive demand from developing countries, we have devoted our study to an affinity-based biosensor for detection of troponin T (TnT), a preferred biomarker of AMI. This combines a stable and inexpensive molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) based on polydopamine (PDA) with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) transduction. Herein we report the fast and specific answer upon TnT binding onto an epitope-imprinted surface that strongly encourages the further development toward antibody-free point-of-care testing for cardiac injury.

AB Sensitive detection of cardiac biomarkers is critical for clinical diagnostics of myocardial infarction (MI) while such detection is quite challenging due to the ultra-low concentration of cardiac biomarkers. In this work, a label-free immunosensor based on optical microfiber coupler (OMC) has been developed for the ultrasensitive detection of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), a selective and highly sensitive biomarker of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). CTnI monoclonal antibodies were immobilized on the surface of the fiber through polyelectrolyte layer using layer-by-layer deposition technique. For refractive index sensing characterization, an ultra-high sensitivity of 91777.9 nm/RIU was achieved when the OMC works around the dispersion turning point, which is the highest experimental demonstration in the field of fiber-optic evanescent biosensors. For biosensing, the immunosensor with good specificity showed a linear wavelength shift in the range of 2-10 fg/mL and an ultra-low detection limit of 2 fg/mL. Such immunosensors have huge application potential for the detection of cardiac biomarkers of myocardial infarction due to simple detection scheme, quick response time, ease of handling and miniaturation.

AB In order to realize the multi-analyte assays for environmental contaminants, an optical biosensor utilizing laser induced fluorescence-based detection via the binding of biomolecules to the surface of an integrated TriPleX (TM) waveguide chip on a glass substrate (fused silica, FS) is described. As far as we know, this is the first demonstration of using the TriPleX (TM) technology to fabricate the waveguide chip on a FS substrate. The sensor consists of 32 individually addressable sensor patches, which were formed on the chip surface by exploiting 3 Y-junction splitters, creating four equal rows of eight evanescently excited windows in parallel. The basic low-loss SiO2/Si3N4 TriPleX (TM) waveguide configuration in combination with on-chip spotsize convertors allows for both high fiber-to-chip coupling efficiency and enables at the same time individually optimized high chip surface intensity and low patch-to-patch deviation. Moreover, the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor compatible fabrication of waveguide chip allows for its mass production at low cost. By taking MC-LR, 2,4-D, atrazine and BPA as the model analytes, the as-proposed waveguide based biosensor was proven sensitive with the detection limits of 0.22 mu g/L for MC-LR, 1.18 mu g/L for 2, 4-D, 0.2 mu g/L for atrazine and 0.06 mu g/L for BPA. Recoveries of the biosensor towards simultaneous detection of MC-LR, 2, 4-D, atrazine and BPA in spiked real water samples varied from 84% to 120%, indicating the satisfactory accuracy of the established technology.

AB Food safety always remains a grand global challenge to human health, especially in developing countries. To solve food safety pertained problems, numerous strategies have been developed to detect biological and chemical contaminants in food. Among these approaches, nanomaterials-based biosensors provide opportunity to realize rapid, sensitive, efficient and portable detection, overcoming the restrictions and limitations of traditional methods such as complicated sample pretreatment, long detection time, and relying on expensive instruments and well-trained personnel. In this review article, we provide a cross-disciplinary perspective to review the progress of nanomaterials-based biosensors for the detection of food contaminants. The review article is organized by the category of food contaminants including pathogens/toxins, heavy metals, pesticides, veterinary drugs and illegal additives. In each category of food contaminant, the biosensing strategies are summarized including optical, colorimetric, fluorescent, electrochemical, and immune- biosensors; the relevant analytes, nanomaterials and biosensors are analyzed comprehensively. Future perspectives and challenges are also discussed briefly. We envision that our review could bridge the gap between the fields of food science and nano technology, providing implications for the scientists or engineers in both areas to collaborate and promote the development of nanomaterials-based biosensors for food safety detection.

AB In this report, titanium nitride thin film synthesized with reactive magneto-sputtering technique is proposed as an alternative surface plasmon resonance sensing material. The physical and chemical natures were initially studied by atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In virtue of white light common-path sensing system, the wavelength modulated TiN films achieved tunable evanescent plasmonic field from 573 nm to 627 nm. The optimized TiN film with 29.8 nm thickness exhibited good differential phase sensitivity (i.e. 1.932 x 10(-7) RIU) to refractive index alteration, which is comparable to the performance of gold film. We have also attained direct measurement of biotin adsorption on the TiN and monitored sub-sequential biotin-streptavidin conjugation. It was found that TiN films have significantly higher binding affinity toward biotin than that of gold in experiments, so we are able to detect biotin directly to 0.22 mu g/ml (0.90 mu M) in label free manner. The adsorption mechanism of biotin on TiN(200) are also explored with periodic density functional theory (DFT) via computer simulation and it was found that the exceptional biotin-TiN affinity may be due to the stacking formation of both N-Ti and O-Ti bonds. Also, the adsorption energy of biotin-TiN was found to be - 1.85 eV, which was two times higher than that of biotin-gold. Both experimental and computational results indicate, for the first time, that the TiN film can be directly functionalized with biotin molecules, thus it serves as an alternative plasmonic material to existing gold-based SPR biosensors.

AB Signal amplification is crucial for obtaining low detection limits in electrochemical immunosensor. In this work, we developed a novel signal amplification strategy using Au@Ag nanoparticles loaded by polydopamine functionalized phenolic resin microporous carbon spheres (Au@Ag/PDA-PR-MCS). Phenolic resin microporous carbon spheres (PR-MCS) possesses uniform size and a large surface area (1656.8 m(2) g(-1) Polydopamine (PDA) functionalized phenolic resin microporous carbon spheres (PDA-PR-MCS) retains the advantages of PR-MCS and possesses strong adsorption ability. With the unique structure of PDA-PR-MCS, it not only improves the loading capacity and dispersity of Au@Ag nanoparticles (Au@Ag NPs), but also enhances the stability for the combination of the Au@Ag NPs by chemical absorption between Au@Ag NPs and -NH2 of PDA. The Au@Ag/PDA-PRMCS exhibits extraordinary electrocatalytic activity towards reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to make the electrochemical response more sensitive. Furthermore, Au NPs with good biocompatibility and excellent conductivity were electrodeposited on the surface of electrode, which was used as a sensing platform to immobilize primary antibody (Abi) and accelerate the electron transfer on the electrode interface. Herein, the designed immunosensor provided a broad linear range from 20 fg/mL to 100 ng/mL for alpha fetoprotein (AFP) detection and a low detection limit of 6.7 fg/mL (signal-to-noise ratio of 3) under optimal experimental conditions. Moreover, the excellent performance in detection of human serum samples indicated that the proposed immunosensor will provide promising applications in clinical monitoring of AFP.

AB In this study, a sensitive sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor was fabricated for the detection of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) based on Co3O4@MnO2-thionine (Co3O4@MnO2-Th) and the screen printing technique. Meanwhile, the pseudo enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (pseudo-ELISA) method was applied in fabricating the immunosensor. Screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) was applied for achieving the detection of AFP. Simultaneously, the amino functionalized Co3O4@MnO2-Th was employed as secondary label and could greatly improve the electrochemical response signal, which was beneficial for detecting AFP. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was applied for the detection of AFP and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) confirmed the successful fabrication of the immunosensor. Under optimal conditions, the immunosensor exhibited a linear response toward AFP in the range of 0.001-100 ng/mL, with a low detection limit of 0.33 pg/mL. Simultaneously, the proposed immunosensor displayed acceptable selectivity, excellent stability and well reproducibility. Furthermore, this proposed strategy may open up new ideas and find many potential applications in the detection of other tumor markers.

AB The portable and rapid detection of biomolecules via pH meters to monitor the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) from biological reactions (e.g. loop-mediated isothermal amplification, LAMP) has attracted research interest. However, this assay strategy suffered from inherent drawback of low sensitivity, resulting in great limitations in practical applications. Herein, a novel electrochemical biosensor was constructed for highly sensitive detection of Nosema bombycis gene DNA (PTP1) through transducing chemical stimuli H+ from PTP1-based LAMP into electrochemical output signal of electroactive ferrocene (Fc). With use of target PTP1 as the template, the H+ from LAMP induced the conformational switch of pH-responsive DNA nanostructures (DNA NSs, Fc-Sp@Ts) that was assembled by the hybridization of Fc-labeled signal probe (Fc-Sp) with DNA -based receptor (Ts). Due to the folding of Ts into stable triplex structure at decreased pH, the configuration change of Fc-Sp@Ts led to the releasing of Fc-Sp, which was subsequently immobilized in the electrode interface through the hybridization with the capture probe modified with -SH (SH-Cp), generating amplified electrochemical signal from Fc. The developed biosensor for PTP1 exhibited a reliable linear range of 1 fg mu L-1 to 50 ng mu L-1 with the limit of detection of 0.31 fg mu L-1. Thus, by the regulation of H+ from LAMP reaction on DNA NSs allostery, this novel and simple transduction scheme would be interesting and promising to open up a novel analytical route for sensitive monitoring of different target DNAs in related disease diagnosis.

AB Rapid and sensitive quantification of multiplex proteins in a wide concentration range is challenging in high throughput analysis. Herein, we proposed a lateral flow assay (LFA) based on core-shell surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanotags for multiplex and quantitative detection of cardiac biomarkers for the early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In practice, Raman dyes (RDs) were embedded into the interior-gap of silver core and gold shell nanoparticles (NPs) to form SERS nanotags as labels instead of gold colloids and three test lines were employed in the strip for the detection of three cardiac biomarkers, Myo, cTnI, and CK-MB, respectively. Due to the amplified signal of the SERS nanotags and the high surface area to volume ratio (SVR) of porous nitrocellulose (NC) membrane, ultrasensitive quantification of protein markers with wide linear dynamic range (LDR) was realized, which is crucial for the quick detection of multiplex biomarkers in the same sample without pretreatments at bedsides. This method makes it possible for LFA in point of care testing (POCT) to be comparable with chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) used in labs.

AB A broad-specific photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensor was developed for the simultaneous detection of ochratoxin A, ochratoxin B and ochratoxin C (OTA, OM, OTC) by using the direct growth of CdS nanorods on FTO as the photoelectrode and Au nanoflowers-modified glass carbon electrode (GCE) as the bioelectrode. The bioelectrode was used to capture antigens and then associate corresponding antibodies, followed by using SiO2@Cu-2+ nanocomposites to conjugate the secondary antibody (Ab(2)) and a DNA strand as the initiator. After the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and the addition of hemin, numerous DNAzymes (G-quadruplex/hemin) were produced. Due to the similar enzymatic property with horseradish peroxidase (HRP), G-quadruplex/hemin can accelerate the oxidation of 4-chloro-l-naphthol (4-CN) with H2O2 to yield the biocatalytic precipitation (BCP) on the bioelectrode. Then, the bioelectrode was further treated with moderate acid and thus Cu2+ was released, which can decrease the photocurrent of the photoelectrode by the formation of CuS. Due to the advantages of surface effect of Au nanoflowers, DNA amplification and high photoelectrocatalytic activity, the proposed broad-specificity PEC immunosensor can detect OTA, OTB and OTC with a detection limit of 0.02, 0.04 and 0.03 pg/mL, respectively. In addition, the acceptable stability and selectivity suggest its possible application in the detection of OTA, OTB and OTC in water samples.

AB The level of total prostate-specific antigen (t-PSA) is generally known as the key index of prostate cancer. Here, phage probes against t-PSA were selected from f8/8 landscape phage library. After three rounds of biopanning, four t-PSA-binding phage clones were isolated and identified by the DNA sequencing. Based on the phage capture assay, the phage clone displaying the fusion peptide ATRSANGM showed highest affinity and specificity against t-PSA. Subsequently, the t-PSA-specific phage was used as t-PSA capture probe in a sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) assay systems. Both assay methods showed high specificity and acceptable reliability for real serum samples analysis. By comparison, DPV method showed wider linear range (0.01-100 ng mL(-1)) and lower limit of detection (3 pg mL(-1)) than those (3.3-330 ng mL(-1) and 1.6 ng mL(-1)) of ELISA. Moreover, DPV system showed smaller distinction to the authoritative method in real samples assay. Excitingly, the phage probe based DPV immunosensor showed high sensitivity for the detection of t-PSA and LOD achieved the pg level, which was far lower than those values (usually above 0.1 ng mL(-1)) for reported immunosensors based on antibodies. Due to the biocompatibility, multivalency, stability, and high structural homogeneity, the t-PSA-specific landscape phage demonstrates as a novel specific interface in biosensors.

AB Bioelectrochemical systems use microbes as catalysts for current production or consumption. Up to now only a few microbes have been demonstrated to be capable of both outward and inward extracellular electron transfer (EET) (i.e. bidirectional electron transfer). However, the mechanisms of electron exchange between microbes and extracellular solids remain uncertain. Here, we showed that Alcaligenes faecalis catalyzed an outward EET and generated electricity at a poised potential of +0.3 V vs. SHE, whereas it conducted an inward EET for autotrophic denitrification at -0.5 V vs. SHE. Both cyclic voltammetry and in situ electrochemical FTIR spectroscopy revealed that different redox components were utilized during the outward and inward EET. Electron transport inhibitor experiments indicated for the first time that complex I, II, III, and the quinone pool on the plasma membrane were involved in the bidirectional EET. Comparative proteomics showed that the protein expression profile of outward-EET biofilms differed greatly from those of inward-EET biofilms, implying that the pili and outer membrane proteins might be responsible for the interfacial outward and inward EET, respectively. These results suggest different electron transport conduits of A. faecalis biofilms could be used for bidirectional EET.

AB In this work, the feasibility of a novel sensitive electrochemiluminescence aptasensor for the detection of lysozyme using Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) (RuSiNPs@PLL-Au) nanocomposites labeling as an indicator was demonstrated. The substrate electrode of the aptasensor was prepared by depositing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on 3D graphene-modified electrode. The lysozyme binding aptamer (LBA) was attached to the 3D graphene/AuNPs electrode through gold-thiol affinity, hybridized with a complementary single-strand DNA (CDNA) of the lysozyme aptamer labeled by RuSiNPs@PLL-Au as an electrochemiluminescence intensity amplifier. Thanks to the synergistic amplification of the 3D graphene, the AuNPs and RuSiNPs@PLL-Au NPs linked to Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)-ECL further enhanced the ECL intensity of the aptasensor. In presence of lysozyme, the CDNA segment of the self-assembled duplex was displaced by the lysozyme, resulting in decreased electrochemiluminescence signal. Under the optimized conditions, the decrease in electrochemiluminescence intensity varied proportionally with the logarithmic concentration of the lysozyme from 2.25 x 10(-12) to 5.0 x 10(-8) mol L-1, and the detection limit was estimated to 7.5 x 10(-13) mol L-1. The aptasensor was further tested in real samples and found reliable for the detection of lysozyme, thus holding great potential application in food safety researches and bioassay analysis.

AB In this study, we developed and validated a single-shank silicon-based neural probe with 128 closely-packed microelectrodes suitable for high-resolution extracellular recordings. The 8-mm-long, 100-mu m-wide and 50-mu m-thick implantable shank of the probe fabricated using a 013-mu m complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) metallization technology contains square-shaped (20 x 20 mu m(2)), low-impedance (similar to 50 k Omega at 1 kHz) recording sites made of rough and porous titanium nitride which are arranged in a 32 x 4 dense array with an inter-electrode pitch of 22.5 mu m. The electrophysiological performance of the probe was tested in in vivo experiments by implanting it acutely into neocortical areas of anesthetized animals (rats, mice and cats). We recorded local field potentials, single- and multi-unit activity with superior quality from all layers of the neocortex of the three animal models, even after reusing the probe in multiple (> 10) experiments. The low-impedance electrodes monitored spiking activity with high signal-to-noise ratio; the peak-to-peak amplitude of extracellularly recorded action potentials of well-separable neurons ranged from 0.1 mV up to 1.1 mV. The high spatial sampling of neuronal activity made it possible to detect action potentials of the same neuron on multiple, adjacent recording sites, allowing a more reliable single unit isolation and the investigation of the spatio-temporal dynamics of extracellular action potential waveforms in greater detail. Moreover, the probe was developed with the specific goal to use it as a tool for the validation of electrophysiological data recorded with high-channel-count, high-density neural probes comprising integrated CMOS circuitry.

AB Rapid, inexpensive and sensitive detection of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), a common cause of ascending urinary tract infections (UTIs) including cystitis and pyelonephritis, is critical given the increasing number of cases and its recurrence worldwide. In this paper, we present a label-free nanoplasmonic sensing platform, built with off-the-shelf optical and electronic components, which can detect intact UPEC at concentrations lower than the physiological limit for UTI diagnosis, in real time. The sensing platform consists of a red LED light source, lens assembly, CMOS detector, Raspberry Pi interface in conjugation with a metallic flow through nanohole array-based sensor. Detection is achieved exploiting nanoplasmonic phenomena from the nanohole arrays through surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) technique. The platform has a bulk sensitivity of 212 pixel intensity unit (PIU)/refractive index unit (RIU), and a resolution in the order of 10(-6) RIU. We demonstrate capture and detection of UPEC with a detection limit of similar to 100 CFU/ml - a concentration well below the threshold limit for UTI diagnosis in clinical samples. We also demonstrate detection of UPEC in spiked human urine samples for two different concentrations of bacteria. This work is particularly relevant for point-of-care applications, especially for regions around the world where accessibility to medical facilities is heavily dependent upon economy, and availability.

AB The present study develops a rapid, simple and efficient method for the determination of type IV collagenase by using a specific peptide-modified quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). A small peptide (P1), contains a specific sequence (Pro-Gly) and a terminal cysteine, was synthetized and immobilized to the surface of QCM electrode via the reaction between Au and thiol of the cysteine. The peptide bond between proline and glycine can be specific hydrolyzed cleavage by type IV collagenase, which enabled the modified electrode with a high selectivity toward type IV collagenase. The cleaving process caused a frequency change of QCM to give a signal related to the concentration of type IV collagenase. The morphologies of the modified electrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the specific hydrolyzed cleavage process was monitored by QCM. When P1 was modified with gold nanoparticles (P1-Au NPs), the signal could be amplified to further enhance the sensitivity of the designed sensor due to the high-mass of the modified Au NPs. Compared the direct unamplified assay, the values obtained for the limit of detection for type IV collagenase was 0.96 ng mL(-1), yielding about 6.5 times of magnitude improvement in sensitivity. This signal enhanced peptide based QCM biosensor for type IV collagenase also showed good selectivity and sensitivity in complex matrix.

AB Owing to the harmful nature of 4-nitrochlorobenzene (4-NCB, one toxic organic pollutant) and the low cost, high sensitivity and ease of operation of electrochemical method, it is highly desirable to develop effect electrochemical sensor for the detection of 4-NCB. Herein, by partially unzipping carbon nanohorns (CNHs) via a simple wet-chemistry method, CNHs and graphene oxide (GO) (CNHs/GO) nanohybrids were produced for sensing 4-NCB with synergistic properties. While the retained CNHs offer a path for rapid electron transport, the GO sheets formed by partially unzipping CNHs provide abundant active sites, further increase in surface area as well as improved dispersibility of the CNHs/GO. Our results show that the CNHs/G0 modified electrode has excellent sensitivity to 4-NCB with a wide linear response range and a detection limit as low as 10 nM.

AB In this study, we developed a novel photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor for the highly sensitive detection of erythromycin by functionalising graphene oxide (GO) with nickel tetra-amined phthalocyanine (NiTAPc) through covalent bonding, which resulted in the formation of NiTAPc-Gr. The fabricated sensor showed a higher PEC efficiency under blue light, exhibiting a peak wavelength of 456 nm, as compared to that of the monomer. Further, the NiTAPc-Gr/indium tin oxide (ITO) sensor exhibited a photocurrent that was 50-fold higher than that for a GO/ITO sensor under the same conditions. Under optimal conditions, the NiTAPc-Gr PEC sensor showed a linear response for erythromycin concentrations ranging from 0.40 to 120.00 mu mol L-1, with the minimum limit for detection being 0.08 mu mol L-1. Thus, the NiTAPc-Gr sensor exhibited superior performance and excellent PEC characteristics, high stability, and good reproducibility with respect to the sensing of erythromycin. Moreover, it is convenient to use, fast, small, and cheap to produce. Hence, it should find wide use in the analysis of erythromycin in real-world applications.

AB Abnormal concentrations of ATP are associated with many diseases and cancers, and quantitative detection of ATP is thus of great importance for disease diagnosis and prognosis. In the present work, we report a new dual recycling amplification sensor integrated with catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) to achieve high sensitivity for fluorescent detection of ATP. The association of the target ATP with the aptamer beacons causes the allosteric structure switching of the aptamer beacons to expose the toehold regions, which hybridize with and unfold the fluorescently quenched hairpin signal probes (HP1) to recycle the target ATP and to trigger CHA between HP1 and the secondary hairpin probes (HP2) to form HP1/HP2 duplexes. Due to the recycling amplification, the presence of ATP leads to the formation of many HP1/HP2 duplexes, generating dramatically amplified fluorescent signals for sensitive detection of ATP. Under optimal experimental conditions, our sensor linearly responds to ATP in the range from 25 to 600 nM with a calculated detection limit of 8.2 nM. Furthermore, the sensor shows a high selectivity and can also be used to detect ATP in human serums to realize its application for real samples. With the distinct advantage of significant signal amplification without the involvement of any nanomaterial and enzyme, the developed sensor thus holds great potential for simple and sensitive detection of different small molecules and proteins.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs), critical biomarkers of acute and chronic diseases, play key regulatory roles in many biological processes. As a result, robust assay platforms to enable an accurate and efficient detection of low-level miRNAs in complex biological samples are of great significance. In this work, a label-free and direct hybridization assay using molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) field-effect transistor (FET) biosensor has been developed for ultrasensitive detection of miRNA-155 as a breast cancer biomarker in human serum and cell-line samples. MoS2, the novel 2D layered material with excellent physical and chemical properties, was prepared through sequential solvent exchange method and was used as an active channel material. MoS2 was comprehensively characterized by spectroscopic and microscopic methods and it was applied for fabrication of FET device by drop-casting MoS2 flacks suspension onto the FET surface. MoS2 FET device showed a relatively low subthreshold swing of 48.10 mV/decade and a high mobility of 1.98 x 10(3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1). Subsequently, probe miRNA-155 strands were immobilized on the surface of the MoS2 FET device. Under optimized conditions detection limit of 0.03 fM and concentration range 0.1 fM to 10 nM were achieved. The developed biosensor not only was capable to identification of fully matched versus one-base mismatch miRNA-155 sequence, but also it could detect target miRNA-155 in spiked real human serum and extracts from human breast cancer cell-line samples. This approach paves a way for label-free, early detection of miRNA as a biomarker in cancer diagnostics with very high sensitivity and good specificity, thus offering a significant potential for clinical application.

AB Chlorpyrifos (chl) is an organophosphate pesticide extensively used in agriculture and highly toxic for human health. Fluorine doped tin-oxide (FTO) based electrochemical nanosensor was developed for chlorpyrifos detection with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and anti-chlorpyrifos antibodies (chl-Ab). AuNPs provides high electrical conductivity and specific resistivity, thus increases the sensitivity of immunoassay. High electrical conductivity of AuNPs reveals that it promotes the redox reaction for better cyclic voltammetry. Based on the intrinsic conductive properties of FTO-AuNPs complex, chl-Ab was immobilized onto AuNPs surface. Under optimized conditions, the proposed FTO based nanosensor exhibited high sensitivity and stable response for the detection of chlorpyrifos, ranging from 1 fM to 1 mu M with limit of detection (LOD) up to 10 fM. The FTO-AuNPs sensor was successfully employed for the detection of chlorpyrifos in standard as well in real samples up to 10 nM for apple and cabbage, 50 nM for pomegranate. The proposed FTO-AuNPs nanosensor can be used as a quantitative tool for rapid, on-site detection of chlorpyrifos traces in real samples when miniaturized due to its excellent stability, sensitivity, and simplicity.

AB We developed a three-dimensional biointerface of graphene-based electrical impedance sensor for metastatic cancer diagnosis at single-cell resolution. Compared with traditional impedance sensor with two-dimensional interface, the graphene biointerface mimiced the topography and somatotype features of cancer cells, achieving more comprehensive and thorough single cell signals in the three-dimensional space. At the nodes of physiological behavior change of single cell, namely cell capture, adhesion, migration and proliferation, the collected electrical signals from graphene biointerface were about two times stronger than those from the two-dimensional gold interface due to the substantial increase in contact area and significant improvement of topographical interaction between cells and graphene electrode. Simultaneous CCD recording and electrical signal extraction from the entrapped single cell on the graphene biointerface enabled to investigate multidimensional cell-electrode interactions and predict cancerous stage and pathology.

AB Molecularly imprinted polymer (MP) nanofilrns for transferrin (Trf) have been synthesized on gold surfaces by electro-polymerizing the functional monomer scopoletin in the presence of the protein target or around pre-adsorbed Trf. As determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) the film thickness was comparable with the molecular dimension of the target. The target (re)binding properties of the electro-synthesized MIP films was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV) through the target-binding induced permeability changes of the MIP nanofilms to the ferricyanide redox marker, as well as by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) of the immobilized protein molecules. For Trf a linear concentration dependence in the lower micromolar range and an imprinting factor of similar to 5 was obtained by SWV and SPR. Furthermore, non-target proteins including the iron-free apo-Trf were discriminated by pronounced size and shape specificity. Whilst it is generally assumed that the rebinding of the target or of cross-reacting proteins exclusively takes place at the polymer here we considered also the interaction of the protein molecules with the underlying gold transducers. We demonstrate by SWV that adsorption of proteins suppresses the signal of the redox marker even at the bare gold surface and by SEIRAS that the treatment of the MIP with proteinase K or NaOH only partially removes the target protein. Therefore, we conclude that when interpreting binding of proteins to directly MIP-covered gold electrodes the interactions between the protein and the gold surface should also be considered.

AB This paper reports an aptamer-based nanopore thin film sensor for detecting theophylline in the buffer solution and complex fluids including plant extracts and serum samples. Compared to antibody-based detection, aptamer-based detection offers many advantages such as low cost and high stability at elevated temperatures. Experiments found that this type of sensor can readily detect theophylline at a concentration as low as 0.05 mu M, which is much lower than the detection limit of current lab-based equipment such as liquid chromatography (LC). Experiments also found that the aptamer-based sensor has good specificity, selectivity, and reasonable reusability with a significantly improved dynamic detection range. By using the same nanopore thin film sensors as the reference sensors to further mitigate the non-specific binding effect, the theophylline in plant extracts and serum has been detected. Only a small amount (similar to 1 mu L) of plant extracts or serum samples is required to measure theophylline. Its low cost and ease-of-operation make this type of sensor suitable for point-of-care application to monitor the theophylline level of patients in real time.

AB Herein, an allosteric kissing complex-based electrochemical biosensor was ingeniously proposed for the simple, sensitive, regenerative and versatile detection of proteins. Two hairpins (Hp1 and Hp2) were designed and the Hp1 was immobilized on the electrode surface, which could form a kissing complex with Hp2 through the apical loop-loop or kissing interaction of the RNA-RNA base sequences. The Hp2 possesses the appended single stranded tails on each end, which hybridize with the recognition element-conjugated DNA strands to construct a protein responsive switch of Hp2 scaffold. After kissing complex formation between the Hp2 scaffold and the immobilized Hp1, the streptavidin-labeled alkaline phosphatase (SA-ALP) can be introduced onto the electrode surface for the generation of electrochemical signal. In the presence of target protein, its binding to the recognition elements linked onto the Hp2 scaffold endows the steric strain to open the Hp2 stem, propagated by the disruption of the kissing complex structure, resulting into a decreased electrochemical signal related with the protein quantification. Also, the Hp1 immobilized electrode can be directly regenerated after protein-induced kissing complex dissociation. The current kissing complex-based electrochemical biosensing strategy can be easily extended for the detection toward different protein targets of interest by simply changing the recognition elements conjugated onto the Hp2 scaffold. The sensitive and selective detection toward proteins could be achieved with the detection limits toward Anti-Dig antibody and thrombin of about 1 ng/mL and 10 pM, respectively. The developed kissing complex-based protein biosensing strategy should be a beneficial supplement in current biosensor field, providing a promising means for the applications in bioanalysis, disease diagnostics, and clinical biomedicine.

AB Foodbome illness outbreaks caused by the consumption of food contaminated with harmful bacteria has drastically increased in the past decades. Therefore, detection of harmful bacteria in the food has become an important factor for the recognition and prevention of problems associated with food safety and public health. Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most commonly isolated foodbome pathogen and it is considered as a major cause of foodbome illnesses worldwide. A number of different methods have been developed for the detection and identification of S. aureus in food samples. However, some of these methods are laborious and time-consuming and are not suitable for on-site applications. Therefore, it is highly important to develop rapid and more approachable detection methods. In the last decade, biosensors have gained popularity as an attractive alternative method and now considered as one of most rapid and on-site applicable methods. An overview of the biosensor based methods used for the detection of S. corms is presented herein. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art biosensor methods towards the detection and quantification of S. aureus, and discusses the most commonly used biosensor methods based on the transducing mode, such as electrochemical, optical, and mass based biosensors.

AB In this paper the field-effect transistor DNA biosensor for detecting hepatitis B virus (HBV) based on indium tin oxide nanowires (ITO NWs) in label free approach has been fabricated. Because of ITO nanowires intensive conductance and functional modified surface, the probe immobilization and target hybridization were increased strongly. The high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurement showed that ITO nanowires were crystalline and less than 50 nm in diameter. The single-stranded hepatitis B virus DNA (SS-DNA) was immobilized as probe on the Au-modified nanowires. The DNA targets were measured in a linear concentration range from 1 fM to 10 mu M. The detection limit of the DNA biosensor was about 1 fM. The time of the hybridization process for defined single strand was 90 min. The switching ratio of the biosensor between "on" and "off'' state was similar to 1.1 x 10(5). For sensing the specificity of the biosensor, non-complementary, mismatch and complementary DNA oligonucleotide sequences were clearly discriminated. The HBV biosensor confirmed the highly satisfied specificity for differentiating complementary sequences from non-complementary and the mismatch oligonucleotides. The response time of the DNA sensor was 37 s with a high reproducibility. The stability and repeatability of the DNA biosensor showed that the peak current of the biosensor retained 98% and 96% of its initial response for measurements after three and five weeks, respectively.

AB The fluorescent CuNCs/ZIF-8 nanocomposites were facilely prepared by mixing the PEI protected CuNCs with the precursors of ZIF-8, and characterized by UV-vis absorption, fluorescence, FT-IR, TEM, XRD and XPS. The quantum yield of the CuNCs/ZIF-8 is 15 times that of the PEI-CuNCs. Furthermore, the CuNCs/ZIF-8 possesses better stability and higher fluorescence response due to protective and confinement effects of MOFs. It was found that H2O2 could cause much more quenching of fluorescent CuNCs/ZIF-8 than that of PEI-CuNCs, which might result from enriching H2O2 by ZIF-8. The CuNCs/ZIF-8 can be designed as a fluorescence probe to selectively and sensitively detect H2O2 with a linear range from 0.01 to 1.5 mu M and a LOD of 0.01 mu M, while those with PEI-CuNCs are 0.5-30 mu M and 0.50 mu M, respectively. Through formation of CuNCs/ZIF-8 hybrid, the sensitivity for the detection of H2O2 increases by nearly 50-fold, which makes CuNCs/ZIF-8 a desirable probe to detect H2O2 content in human serum samples. Also, we successfully demonstrated the potential application of the CuNCs/ZIF-8 for screening and evaluating activities of oxidase using glucose oxidase as a model. The glucose oxidase activity can be detected in a range of 0.1-10 mU/L with a LOD of 0.1 mU/L.

AB This report outlines a highly sensitive and facile electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensing platform based on a novel high-quantum-yield Au-nanocluster (AuNC) probe for glutathione (GSH) detection. Owing to the prominent quenching effect of GSH on the ECL of the AuNCs, the proposed ECL nanosensor showed a wide response to GSH in the ranges of 1.0 x 10(-9)-1.0 x 10(-5) M and 1.0 x 10(-5)-1.0 x 10(-1) M and a low detection limit of 3.2 x 10(-10) M. In addition, the proposed system exhibited good selectivity for GSH in the presence of other chemical/biological interferences. Moreover, since no further functionalization of AuNC-based sensor interface was necessary, together with the stability, high sensitivity and selectivity of the proposed nanosensor, this convenient approach was able to successfully detect GSH in both of human urine samples and blood samples with excellent recoveries, which indicated its promising application under physiological conditions. Of significant importance is that this study not only helps in gaining a better understanding of the applicability of the ECL properties of AuNCs, but also provides a new avenue for the design and development of ECL sensors based on the novel high-quantum-yield AuNC-based probe and other functional-metal-based NC probes.

AB Based on our produced polyclonal antibody capable of recognizing tetrabromobisphenol A bis(2-hydroxyethyl) ether (TBBPA-DHEE) and tetrabromobisphenol A mono(hydroxyethyl) ether (TBBPA-MHEE) (cross-reactivity, 100% for TBBPA DHEE; 98.7% for TBBPA MHEE), an important derivative and byproduct of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), respectively, a novel ultrasensitive competitive immunosensor was established using an electrochemical impedimetric strategy for the simultaneous detection of both chemicals. A significantly amplified electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for quantitative target analysis was obtained through (i) the biocatalytic precipitation of 4-chloro-1-naphthol (CN) on the electrode surface triggered by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and (ii) increased amounts of the enzyme with HRP-loaded silica nanoparticles carrying poly brushes (SiO2@PAA) as labels, achieving a remarkable improvement in catalytic performance. Under the optimized conditions, the immunosensor showed satisfactory accuracy (recovery, 84.6-118%) and a good linear range (0.21- 111.31 ng/mL) with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.08 ng/mL (S/N = 3) for TBBPA DHEE and TBBPA MHEE. In addition, the proposed approach was used to analyse real environmental water samples, and our results indicated that this immunosensor had great potential for the determination of the trace pollutants in aquatic environments.

AB The development of highly sensitive and selective enantiomeric platforms towards the rapid screening of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is nowadays a crucial challenge in several fields related to pharmacology, biomedicine, biotechnology and (bio)sensors. Herein, it is presented a novel, facile and generic methodology focused on exploiting the synergistically and electrocatalytic properties of chiral magnetic-nanobiofluids (mNBFs) with electrochemical enantiobiosensing at a magneto nanocomposite graphene paste electrode (mNC-GPE). The feasibility of this approach has been validated by chirally recognizing tryptophan (TRP) enantiomers as a proof-of-concept. For this aim, a specific chiral mNBF based on an aqueous dispersion of cobalt ferrite loaded with gold nanoparticles carrying a thiolated beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD-SH/Ati/CoFe2O4-NPs) has been synthesized and used towards the supramolecular discrimination of TRP enantiomers at an advanced graphene-paste transducer via cyclic voltammetry. This strategy, which is the first demonstration of applicability of chiral mNBFs for electrochemical enantiorecognition, opens up new approaches into enantio(bio)sensing.

AB A simple and sensitive electrochemical biosensor was developed for microRNA-196a detection, which is of important diagnostic significance for pancreatic cancer. It was based on cyclic enzymatic signal amplification (CESA) and template-free DNA extension reaction. In the presence of microRNA-196a, duplex-specific nuclease (DSN) catalyzed the digestion of the 3'-PO4 terminated capture probe (CP), resulting in the target recycling amplification. Meanwhile, the 3'-OH terminal of CP was exposed. Then, template-free DNA extension reaction was triggered by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), producing amounts of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). After ssDNA absorbed numerous methylene blue (MB), an ultrasensitive electrochemical readout was obtained. Based on this dual amplification mechanism, the proposed biosensor exhibited a high sensitivity for detection of microRNA-196a down to 15 aM with a linear range from 0.05 fM to 50 pM. This biosensor displayed high specificity, which could discriminate target microRNAs from one base mismatched microRNAs. It also showed good reproducibility and stability. Furthermore, it was successfully applied to the determination of microRNA-196a in plasma samples. In conclusion, with the excellent analytical performance, this biosensor might have the potential for application in clinical diagnostics of pancreatic cancer.

AB A high-performance sensing platform based on poly-xanthurenic acid (PXA) film functionalized MoS2 nanosheets was developed for electrochemical detection of circulating tumor DNA in peripheral blood. The MoS2 nanosheets were obtained using a simple ultrasonic method from bulk MoS2. The physical adsorption between MoS2 and aromatic XA monomers effectively improved the electropolymerization efficiency, accompanied with an increased electrochemical response of PXA. The obtained PXA/MoS2 nanocomposite not only served as a substrate for DNA immobilization but also reflected the electrochemical transduction originating from DNA immobilization and hybridization without any complex labelling processes or outer indicators. The immobilization of the probe ssDNA was achieved via noncovalent assembly due to the pi-pi interaction between PXA and DNA bases. After the hybridization of the probe ssDNA with the target DNA, the formation of helix structure induced the resulted dsDNA to be released from the surface of the PXA/MoS2 nanocomposite. The detection limit of this constructed DNA biosensor was calculated in the linear target DNA concentrations range from 1.0 x 10(-16) mol/L to 1.0 x 10(-10) mol/L and it was found to be 1.8 x 10(-17) mol/L.

AB Chiral recognition of alpha-amino acids is attracting increasing interest due to the importance of alpha-amino acids in protein metabolism as well as in food products and pharmaceuticals. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) with gate electrodes modified with molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) films were fabricated and successfully used as highly selective and sensitive chiral recognition biosensors for D/L-tryptophan (D/L-Trp) and D/L-tyrosine (D/L-Tyr). The MIP films, which can specifically recognize and has an electrocatalytic effect on the oxidation of Trp and Tyr, together with the amplification function of an OECT, provide a highly sensitive and selective OECT biosensor. The sensor showed a linear response range for L-Trp and t-Tyr from 300 nM to 10 mu M with a sensitivity of 3.19 and 3.64 mu A/mu M, respectivity. And the detection limit for L-Trp and L-Tyr is of 2 nM and 30 nM (S/N > 3). The selectivity factors of L-Trp, D-Trp, L-Tyr and D-Tyr to their enantiomers are 11.6, 3.5, 14.5 and 2.6, respectively. This method can pave the way for widespread applications of OECT-based sensors in chiral material identification.

AB 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) has been frequently used as an indicator in G-quadruplex/hemin DNAzyme (G4zyme)-based chemical and biochemical analysis, and its oxidation products are usually monitored by electrochemical or optical methods to quantify G4zyme formation-related analytes. Herein we report a simple electrochemical approach based on isoporous silica-micelle membrane (iSMM) to measure TMB, instead of its oxidation products, in G4zyme-based detection of specific analytes. The iSMM was grown on the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode, which was composed of highly ordered, vertically oriented silica nanochannels and cylindrical micelles of cetyltrimethylammonium. The iSMM-ITO electrode was selectively responsive to neutral TMB but not its oxidation products, thanks to the sieving and pre-concentration capacity of micellar structures in terms of molecular charge and lipophilicity. In other words, only TMB could be extracted and enriched into micelles and subsequently oxidized at the underlying ITO electrode surface (namely the micelle/ITO interface), generating an amplified anodic current. Since the depletion of TMB was catalyzed by G4zymes formed in the presence of specific analyte, the decrease of this anodic current enabled the quantitative detection of this analyte. The current variation relative to its initial value ((j(0)-j)/j(0)), termed as the current attenuation ratio, showed the obvious dependence on the analyte concentration. As proof-of-concept experiments, four substances, i.e., potassium cation (K+), adenosine triphosphate, thrombin and nucleic acid, were detected in aqueous media and the analysis of K+ in pre-treated human serum was also performed.

AB By combining the gold nanoparticle (AuNP) enumeration with target-induced strand-displacement reaction, we have developed a non-amplification platform for DNA and miRNA detection based on a deliberately designed sandwich-structured nanocomplex probe (SNC Probe). The proposed strategy can realize the sensitive detection of nucleic acids within 40 min with the detection limit of 6.6 fM for HBV DNA and 13.5 fM for miRNA-141, respectively. The method presents reasonable ability to discriminate miRNA-141 from all the other members of miRNA-200 family. And it can also be used for direct detection of miRNA-141 in samples of extracted total small RNA from different cell lines which are reported to have altered levels of miRNA-141. Furthermore, the spike recovery (n = 3) of miRNA-141 in total small RNA extracts of Hela cells is found to be 92.8% for 20 p.M. and 94.7% for 100 p.M. with the standard deviation of 9.2% and 6.8%, respectively. As the only reagent involved in the assay, the SNC Probe presents a very good stability with a relative standard deviation of 3.3% amongst eight tests in 30 days, which greatly simplifies the assay procedure and presents the suitability for routine analyses. On the basis of these findings, this simple non-amplification assay platform can be expected to find assorted applications that can make the best use of the simplicity and sensitivity.

AB In this study, electrochemical sensors for the enantioselective recognition of D and L phenylalanine were prepared using a molecular imprinting technique in which the electro-polymerization of pyrrole was carried out by Chronopotentiometry(CP) with the target molecules being present on a Ag screen printed electrode's (SPE) surface. The sensing performance was evaluated by multi-potential steps at 0 and 2 V(vs. Ag/AgCl) held for 1 s and 2 s, respectively, for 20 cycles (with the two enantiomers being present at the same concentration). The individual selectivity's for L and D-phenylalanine on their respective imprinted films were estimated to be L/D = 23.480 +/- 2.844/1 and D/L = 19.134 +/- 1.870/1 respectively, based on the current change between 0 and 2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) with the two enantiomers being present at the same concentration (10 mM). Several parameters affecting recognition ability were investigated including: cross-selectivity of D and L-phenylalanine imprinted film, phenylalanine concentration effects, interfering species, deactivation and the storage life of electrode. The phenylalanine imprinted films were also characterized by AC impedance, chronoamperometry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscope(SEM), and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS). Finally, a recognition mechanism for the interaction of the polypyrrole film with its template under the influence of applied negative and positive potentials is proposed.

AB Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a critical biological marker for osteoblast activity during early osteoblast differentiation, but few biologically compatible methods are available for its detection. Here, we describe the discovery of highly sensitive and rapidly responsive novel near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probes (NIR-Phos-1, NIR-Phos-2) for the fluorescent detection of ALP. ALP cleaves the phosphate group from the NIR skeleton and substantially alters its photophysical properties, therefore generating a large "turn-on" fluorescent signal resulted from the catalytic hydrolysis on fluorogenic moiety. Our assay quantified ALP activity from 0 to 1.0 U mL(-1) with a 10(-5)-10(-3) U mL(-1) limit of detection (LOD), showing a response rate completed within 1.5 min. A potentially powerful approach to probe ALP activity in biological systems demonstrated real-time monitoring using both concentration- and time-dependent variations of endogenous ALP in live cells and animals. Based on high binding affinity to bone tissue of phosphate moiety, bone-like scaffold-based ALP detection in vivo was accessed using NIR probe-labeled three-dimensional (3D) calcium deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA) scaffolds. They were subcutaneously implanted into mice and monitored ALP signal changes using a confocal imaging system. Our results suggest the possibility of early-stage ALP detection during neo-bone formation inside a bone defect, by in vivo fluorescent evaluation using 3D CDHA scaffolds.

AB DNA can be modified to function as a scaffold for the construction of a DNA nanomachine, which can then be used in analytical applications if the DNA nanomachine can be triggered by the presence of a diagnostic DNA or some other analyte. We herein propose a novel and powerful DNA nanomachine that can detect DNA via combining the tandem strand displacement reactions and a DNA walker. Three different DNA sensing platforms are described, where the whole DNA machine was constructed on a gold electrode (GE). This cascade multiple amplification strategy exhibited an excellent sensitivity. Under optimal conditions, the electrochemical sensor could achieve a detection limit of 36 fM with a linear range from 50 to 500 fM. In particular, the electrochemical sensor could easily distinguish the base mutations. More interestingly, the DNA nanomachine could be used to construct analog AND and OR logic gates. We demonstrate that electrochemical signals generated from the different input combinations can be used to distinguish multiple target DNAs. The practical applicability of the present biosensor is demonstrated by the detection of target DNA in human serum with satisfactory results, which holds great potential for a future application in clinical diagnosis.

AB Motivation behind the present work is to fabricate a cost effective and scalable biosensing platform for an easy and reliable detection of cancer biomarker Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Here, we report the sensitive and selective detection of CEA using graphene based bio-sensing platform. Large sized (similar to 2.5 x 1.0 cm(2)), uniform, continuous, single and few layers graphene films have been grown on copper (Cu) substrate employing chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique using hexane as a liquid precursor. Functional group has been created over Graphene/Cu substrate through pi-pi stacking of 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester (PBSE). Further, to make the sensor specific to CEA, antibody of CEA (anti-CEA) has been covalently immobilized onto PBSE/Graphene/Cu electrode. Selective and sensitive detection of CEA is achieved by anti-CEA/PBSE/Graphene/Cu electrode through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Under optimal condition, the fabricated sensor shows linear response in the physiological range 1.0-25.0 ng mL(-1) (normal value similar to 5.0 ng mL(-1)), revealing sensitivity 563.4 Omega ng(-1) mL cm(-2) with a correlation coefficient of 0.996 and limit of detection (LOD) 0.23 ng mL(-1). In this way, one step electrode fabrication with high specific surface area provides a light weight, low cost, reliable and scalable novel biosensing platform for sensitive and selective detection of CEA. We believe that this bioelectrode equipped with specific recognition elements could be utilized for detection of other biomolecules too.

AB The difference of electrostatic interaction between free Ru(phen)(3)(2+) and Ru(phen)(3)(2+) embedded in double strand DNA (dsDNA) to the negatively charged indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode has been applied to develop a homogeneous and label-free electrochemiluminescence (ECL) aptasensor for the first time. Ochratoxin A (OTA) has been chosen as the model target. The OTA aptamer is first hybridized with its complementary single strand DNA (ssDNA) to form dsDNA and then interacted with Ru(phen)(3)(2+) via the grooves binding mode to form dsDNA-Ru(phen)(3)(2+) complex, which remains negatively charged feature as well as low diffusion capacity to the negatively charged ITO electrode surface owing to the electrostatic repulsion. Meanwhile, the intercalated Ru (phen)(3)(2+) in the grooves of dsDNA works as an ECL signal reporter instead of the labor-intensive labeling steps and can generate much more ECL signal than that from the labeling probe. In the presence of target, the aptamer prefers to form an aptamer-target complex in lieu of dsDNA, which induces the releasing of Ru(phen)(3)(2+) from the dsDNA-Ru(phen)(3)(2+) complex into the solution. With the assistance of RecJ(f) exonuclease (a ssDNA specific exonuclease), the released ssDNA and the aptamer in the target-complex were digested into mononucleotides. In the meantime, the target can be also liberated from OTA-aptamer complex and induce target cycling and large amount of free Ru(phen)(3)(2+) present in the solution. Since Ru(phen)(3)(2+) contains positive charges, which can diffuses easily to the ITO electrode surface because of electrostatic attraction, causing an obviously enhanced ECL signal detected. Under the optimal conditions, the enhanced ECL of the system has a linear relationship with the OTA concentration in the range of 0.01-1.0 ng/mL with a detection limit of 2 pg/mL. This innovative system not only expands the immobilization-free sensors in the electrochemiluminescent fields, but also can be developed for the detection of different targets easily with the same strategy by changing the aptamer used.

AB Up to now, the colloidal gold labeling immunochromatographic test strip is a mature and applicable technology. However, different from the conventional gold nanoparticle, quantum dot (QD) possesses larger specific surface area and better biocompatibility. So, as a novel nanomaterial, QD is capable of assembling more biomolecule which could enhance the sensitivity and accuracy of strips by rationality. Besides, strand displacement amplification was drawn into our test strips in this paper, this assumption made HIV-DNA recycling many times and converting it to plentiful QD-dsDNA (double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid), where after these nano-structures would be captured by test zone. Meanwhile, the suggested scheme eliminated the hook effect owing to the target drop out of the incorporation on test zone, and any nucleotide sequence or substance which has aptamers can work as the target, such as carcinoembryonic antigen or mycotoxin. This assay realized the detection limit of as low as 0.76 pM (S/N = 3) and the detection range of 1 pM to 10 nM. In the end, we made use of this fluorescent lateral flow assay strips with great reproducibility for detecting HIV-DNA in human serum, that attested this method could be applied to practical application prospectively.

AB In this work, an electrochemical biosensor based on Au nanorods (NRs) modified microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (mu PADs) were constructed for sensitive detection of microRNA (miRNA) by using cerium dioxide - Au@glucose oxidase (CeO2-Au@GOx) as an electrochemical probe for signal amplification. Au NRs were synthesized by in-situ growth method in mu PADs surface to enhance the conductivity and modified hairpin probe through Au-S bonds. The construction of "the signal transducer layer" was carried out by GOx catalyzing glucose to produce H2O2, which was further electrocatalyzed by CeO2. After the biosensor was constructed, an obvious electrochemical signal was observed from the reduction of H2O2. In order to make the detection more convincing, the visual detection was performed based on the oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine by H2O2 with the help of Exonuclease I. The electrochemical biosensor provided a wide linear range of 1.0 fM to 1000 fM with a relatively low detection limit of 0.434 fM by the electrochemical measurement. Linear range of 10 fM to 1000 fM with a relatively low detection limit of 7.382 fM was obtained by visual detection. The results indicated the proposed platform has potential utility for detection of miRNA.

AB A cell-based electrochemical biosensor was developed to determine the antioxidant activity of Asp-Leu-Glu-Glu (DLEE) isolated from dry-cured Chinese Xuanwei ham. A platinized gold electrode (Pt NPs/GE) covered with silver nanowires (Ag NWs) was fabricated to detect H2O2 using redox signaling via cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Under optimal condition, the detection limit of the modified electrode was 0.12 mu M with a linear relationship from 0.2 to 2 mu M, which showed relatively outstanding catalytic effects towards the reduction of H2O2. Furthermore, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell can be used to indirectly assess changes in intercellular oxidative stress by detecting variations in electrochemical signals. A 3D cell culture of alginate/graphene oxide (NaAlg/GO) was used to encapsulate and immobilize Caco-2 cells. Based on ROS generation and electrochemical results, we found that DLEE could effectively reduce oxidative stress level in Caco-2 cells under external stimulation. DLEE showed high antioxidant activity with a relative antioxidant capacity (RAC) rate of 88.17% at 1.5 mg/mL. Finally, an efficient electrochemical biosensor was established using the active 3D Caco-2 cell platform. This system is sensitive and simple to operate with the property to evaluate the antioxidant activity of peptides by the detection of H2O2 in cell membrane. In summary, this work describes a new method for assessing antioxidant capacity of peptide DLEE using cell-based electrochemical signaling with a rapid screening pattern.

Early intervention in patients with chronic kidney disease has the potential to delay, or even prevent, the development of end stage renal disease and complications, leading to a marked impact on life expectancy and quality of life. Thus, a potable electrochemical diagnostic biosensor has become an attractive option as electrochemical analysis is feasible to use for on-site detection of samples. In human, Cystatin C present in human body fluids is freely filtered by the glomerulus, but reabsorbed and catabolised by the renal tubules. Trace detectable amount is eliminated in urine, giving this molecular marker an edge over serum creatinine's disadvantages. A carboxyl functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes screen printed electrode was immobilized with papain (cysteine protease) where amino group of papain covalently bound carboxyl group on electrode surface by EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide) and NHS (N-hydroxysuccinirnide) chemistry. The modifications on sensor surface were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy. Interaction between papain and chronic kidney disease specific biomarker, Cystatin C was detected by cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry within 10 min. The sensor is highly specific to Cystatin C and showed negligible response to non-specific macromolecules present in urine. The sensitivity of the sensor was 1583.49 mu A cm(-2) mu g(-1) and lower limit of detection of Cystatin C was found 0.58 ng L-1 which presents as a promising platform for designing potable kidney disease detector.

AB Subdural surface and penetrating depth probes are widely applied to record neural activities from the cortical surface and intracortical locations of the brain, respectively. Simultaneous surface and depth neural activity recording is essential to understand the linkage between the two modalities. Here, we develop flexible dual modality neural probes based on graphene transistors. The neural probes exhibit stable electrical performance even under 90 degrees bending because of the excellent mechanical properties of graphene, and thus allow multi-site recording from the subdural surface of rat cortex. In addition, finite element analysis was carried out to investigate the mechanical interactions between probe and cortex tissue during intracortical implantation. Based on the simulation results, a sharp tip angle of pi/6 was chosen to facilitate tissue penetration of the neural probes. Accordingly, the graphene transistor-based dual-modality neural probes have been successfully applied for simultaneous surface and depth recording of epileptiform activity of rat brain in vivo. Our results show that graphene transistor-based dual-modality neural probes can serve as a facile and versatile tool to study tempo spatial patterns of neural activities.

AB The impedance of electrodes with adherent biological cells correlates with cell viability and proliferation. To model this correlation, we exploited the idea that the introduction of a highly conductive layer into the equatorial equipotential slice of a system with an oriented, freely suspended, single ellipsoidal cell may split the system into mirror-symmetrical halves without changing the field distribution. Each half possesses half of the system's impedance and contains a hemiellipsoidal cell attached to the conductive layer, which can be considered a bottom electrode. For a hemiellipsoidal adherent cell model (ACM) with standard electrical properties for the external and cellular media, the assumption of a bottom membrane and a subcellular cleft in the 100 nm range, as found in adherent cells, changed the potential distribution over a one-% range up to frequencies of 1 MHz. For simplicity, potential distributions for slices of spheroidal objects can be numerically calculated in 2D. The 2D distributions can be converted into three dimensions using simplified equations for the influential radii of spheroids. After the ACM approach was expanded to adherent cell patch models (APMs), the feasibility of our model modifications was tested using two criteria: the constancy of the equipotential plane touching the poles of ACMs or APMs and a comparison of the impedance, which could be numerically calculated from the overall current between the bottom electrode and a plane-parallel counter-electrode, with the impedance of the suspension obtained from Maxwell-Wagner's mixing equation applied to hemiellipsoidal cells.

AB Vector-borne diseases are a major concern for human health globally, especially malaria in densely populated, less developed, tropical regions of the world. Malaria causes loss of human life and economic harm, and may spread through travelers to new regions. Though there are sufficient therapeutics available for the effective treatment and cure of malaria, it infects millions of people and claims several thousand lives every year. Early diagnosis of the infection can potentially prevent the spread of disease, save lives, and mitigate the financial impact. Conventional analytical techniques are being widely employed for malaria diagnosis, but with low sensitivity and selectivity. Due to the poor-resource settings where malaria outbreaks often occur, most conventional diagnostic methods are not affordable and hence not effective in detection and controlling the spread of the infection. However, biosensors have improved the scope for affordable malaria diagnosis. Advances in biotechnology and nanotechnology have provided novel recognition materials and transducer elements, discoveries which allow the fabrication of affordable biosensor platforms with improved attributes. The present work covers the advancement in biosensors with an introduction to malaria, followed by conventional methods of malaria diagnosis, malaria markers, novel recognition elements and the biosensor principle. Finally, a proactive role and a perspective on developed biosensor platforms are discussed with potential biomedical applications.

AB Biosensors based on converting the concentration of analytes in complex samples into single electrochemical signals are attractive candidates as low cost, high-throughput, portable and renewable sensor platforms. Here, we describe a simple but practical analytical device for sensing an anticancer drug in whole blood, using the detection of methotrexate (MTX) as a model system. In this biosensor, a novel carbon-based composite, tungsten phosphide embedded nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (WP/N-CNT), was fixed to the electrode surface that supported redox cycling. The electronic transmission channel in nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNT) and the synergistic effect of uniform distribution tungsten phosphide (WP) ensured that the electrode materials have outstanding electrical conductivity and catalytic performance. Meanwhile, the surface electronic structure also endows its surprisingly reproducible performance. To demonstrate portable operation for MTX sensing, screen printing electrodes (SPE) was modified with WP/N-CNT. The sensor exhibited low detection limits (45 nM), wide detection range (0.01-540 mu M), good selectivity and long-term stability for the determination of MTX. In addition, the technique was successfully applied for the determination of MTX in whole blood.

AB A novel nitrogen/argon (N-2/Ar) radio frequency (RF) plasma functionalized graphene nanosheet/graphene nanoribbon (GS/GNR) hybrid material (N-2/Ar/GS/GNR) was developed for simultaneous determination of ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA) and uric acid (UA). Various nitrogen mites introduced into GS/GNR hybrid structure was evidenced by a detailed microscopic, spectroscopic and surface area analysis. Owing to the unique structure and properties originating from the enhanced surface area, nitrogen functional groups and defects introduced on both the basal and edges, N-2/Ar/GS/GNR/GCE showed high electrocatalytic activity for the electrochemical oxidations of AA, DA, and UA with the respective lowest detection limits of 5.3, 2.5 and 5.7 nM and peak-to-peak separation potential (Delta Ep) (vs Ag/AgCl) in DPV of 220, 152 and 372 mV for AA/DA, DA/UA and AA/UA respectively. Moreover, the selectivity, stability, repeatability and excellent performance in real time application of the fabricated N-2/Ar/GS/GNR/GCE electrode suggests that it can be considered as a potential electrode material for simultaneous detection of AA, DA, and UA.

AB In this work, a novel sandwich-type aptasensor was designed for the ultrasensitive recognition of trace mercury ions in water. Numerous oriented platinum nanotube arrays (PtNAs) were in-situ crystallized on a flexible electrode as a sensing interface, while thionine labelled Fe3O4/rGO nanocomposites as signal amplifiers. Both PtNAs/CF and nanocomposites were synthesized by easy hydrothermal processes. With their large surface area, it was favorable for electrochemical performance and immobilization of capture DNAs (cDNA) and report DNAs (rDNA). Upon the existence of Hg2+, partial linker DNAs were tightly bound with cDNAs through thymine-Hg2+-thymine pairing (T-Hg2+-T). Then rDNAs attached Fe3O4/rGO nanoprobes were fixed on the electrode through the match of remaining linker DNAs and rDNAs. Under the optimal conditions, the Hg2+ aptasensor showed a synergistic amplification performance with a wide linear range from 0.1nM to 100 nM, as well as a low detection limit of 30 pM. Moreover, the as-prepared aptasensor also exhibited reliable performance for assay in real lake water samples.

AB Lysozyme (LYS) is a bacteriolytic enzyme, available in secretions such as saliva, tears and human milk. LYS is an important defence molecule of the innate immune system, and its overexpression can be a consequence of diseases such as leukemia, kidney disease and sarcoidosis. This paper reports on a digital microfluidic-based approach that combines the gold nanoparticle-enhanced chemiluminescence with aptamer interaction to detect human lysozyme into droplets 20 nanoliters in volume. The described method allows identifying LYS with a 44.6 femtomolar limit of detection, using sample volume as low as 1 mu L and detection time in the range of 10 min. We used luminol to generate the chemiluminescence and demonstrated that the compartmentalization of LYS in droplets also comprising gold nanoparticles provided enhanced luminescence. We functionalized the gold nanoparticles with a thiolated aptamer to achieve the required selectivity that allowed us to detect LYS in human serum.

AB In this work, the manganese porphyrin (MnPP) decorated on DNA networks could serve as quencher and mimicking enzyme to efficiently reduce the photocurrent of photoactive material 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic acid (PTCA), which was elaborately used to construct a novel label-free aptasensor for ultrasensitive detection of thrombin (TB) in a signal-off manner. The Au-doped PTCA (PTCA-PEI-Au) with outstanding membrane-forming and photoelectric property was modified on electrode to acquire a strong initial photoelectrochemistry (PEC) signal. Afterward, target binding aptamer I (TBAI) was modified on electrode to specially recognize target TB, which could further combine with TBAII and single-stranded DNA P1-modified platinum nanoparticles (TBAII-PtNPs-P1) for immobilizing DNA networks with abundant MnPP. Ingeniously, the MnPP could not only directly quench the photocurrent of PTCA, but also acted as hydrogen peroxide (HRP) mimicking enzyme to remarkably stimulate the deposition of benzo-4-chlorhexidine (4-CD) on electrode for further decreasing the photocurrent of PTCA, thereby obtaining a definitely low photocurrent for detection of TB. As a result, the proposed PEC aptasensor illustrated excellent sensitivity with a low detection limit down to 3 fM, exploiting a new avenue about intergrating two functions in one substance for ultrasensitive biological monitoring.

AB A novel method for study the interaction between carbohydrate and lectin was developed in homogenous solution. DNA was introduced to the recognition process of carbohydrate with protein. Due to the versatile detection mode of DNA, the detection efficiency for carbohydrate and protein was highly promoted. Herein, two kinds of mannose-DNA conjugates were synthesized. One of which was used to prepare DNA-templated silver nanocluster (AgNCs) and the other one contained guanine-rich DNA sequences. When the mannose of two conjugates binding to lectin Concanavalin A (Con A), great enhancement on fluorescence intensity was obtained due to the proximity ligation of the DNA-templated Ag NCs with guanine-rich DNA sequences. Hence Con A can be quantified conveniently in homogenous solution using Ag NCs with low toxicity and tunable fluorescence. Moreover, carbohydrate functionalized DNA-templated AgNCs was also utilized for cancer cell imaging based on the recognition of mannose with mannose receptor on cancer cell MDA-MB-231.

AB A variety of nucleic add amplification techniques have been integrated into different detection methods to promote the development of sensitive and convenient analysis of nucleic acids. However, it is still in urgent need to develop amplified nucleic acid biosensors for the analysis of susceptible gene and even distinguishing single base mismatched DNA in complex biological samples. Benefiting from the achieved detection strategies, here we boost isothermal nucleic acid amplification by resorting to enzyme amplification, and combine this two-stage amplification method with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to develop a signal-on nucleic acid detection platform. Due to the high cleavage efficiency of Exonuclease III (Exo III), a large amount of trigger DNA are produced to initiate multiple hybridization chain reaction circles. The product structure tagged with Tamra is then anchored onto the plasmonic SERS substrate and meanwhile enriched. It is demonstrated that this detection platform is sensitive toward the myocardial infarction disease related gene. A detection limit of 1 fM for the gene analysis in a linear relationship in the wide range from 1 fM to 10 nM is achieved, better than most of previous counterparts. Meanwhile, our developed detection platform exhibits a high selectivity for the target gene over mismatched analogues. Our strategy provides a robust tool for signal amplification of gene detection even in blood samples.

AB A novel sandwich immunoassay based immunochromatographic test strip (ICTS) has been developed for simultaneously measuring both butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity and the total amount of BChE (including inhibited and active enzyme) from 70 mu Lpost-exposure human plasma sample. The principle of this method is based on the BChE monoclonal antibody (MAb) capable of acting as both capture antibody and detection antibody. The BChE MAb which was immobilized on the test line was able to recognize both organophosphorus BChE adducts (OP-BChE) and BChE and provided equal binding affinity, permitting detection of the total enzyme amount in post-exposure human plasma samples. The formed immunocomplexes on the test line can further be excised from the test-strip for subsequent off-line measurement of BChE activity using the Ellman assay. Therefore, dual biomarkers of BChE activity and phosphorylation (OP-BChE) will be obtained simultaneously. The whole sandwich-immunoassay was performed on one ICTS, greatly reducing analytical time. The ICTS sensor showed excellent linear responses for assaying total amount of BChE and active BChE ranging from 0.22 to 3.58 nM and 0.22-7.17 nM, respectively. Both the signal detection limits are 0.10 nM. We validated the practical application of the proposed method to measure 124 human plasma samples from orchard workers and cotton farmers with long-term exposure to organophosphorus pesticides (OPs). The results were in highly agreement with LC/MS/MS which verified our method is extremely accurate. Combining the portability and rapidity of test strip and the compatibility of BChE MAb as both capture antibody and detection antibody, the developed method provides a baseline-free, low-cost and rapid tool for in-field monitoring of OP exposures.

AB A novel detection platform with high malathion specificity has been developed, which operates based on the signal response in the fluorescence of CdTe@CdS quantum dots (QDs). The designed nanoprobe comprises of QDs, poly(N-(3-guanidinopropyl)methacrylamide) homopolymer (PGPMA) and malathion specific aptamer. The interaction of aptamer with malathion results in switching off of the fluorescence signal of the probe due to the availability of the cationic polymer, which causes quenching of the QDs. However, in the absence of malathion, the polymer interacts with the aptamer, via electrostatic interactions thereby rendering the fluorescence of QDs unaffected. The assay exhibited excellent sensitivity towards malathion with a detection limit of 4 pM. A logarithmic correlation was observed in a wide range of malathion concentrations from 0.01 nm to 1 mu M, facilitating the potential of proposed assay in the quantitative determination of the analyte of interest. The selectivity of the designed probe was confirmed in the presence of various pesticides, commonly employed in agricultural fields.

AB Recent research on cellular responses is shifting from static observations recorded under static stimuli to real-time monitoring in a dynamic environment. Since cells sense and interact with their surrounding micro environment, an experimental platform where dynamically changing cellular microenvironments should be recreated in vitro. There has been a lack of microfluidic devices to support spatial and temporal stimulations in a simple and robust manner. Here, we describe a microfluidic device that generates dynamic chemical gradients and pulses in both space and time using a single device. This microfluidic device provides at least 12 h of continuous stimulations that can be used to observe responses from mammalian cells. Combination of the microfluidic device with live-cell imaging facilitates real-time observation of dynamic cellular response at single cell level. Using stable HEK cells with biosensors, ERK (Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase) activities were observed under the pulsatile and ramping stimulations of EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor). We quantified ERK activation even at extremely low EGF concentration (0.0625 mu g/ml), which can not be observed using conventional techniques such as western blot. Cytoskeleton rearrangement of the 3T3 fibroblast (stable transfection with Lifeact-GFP) was compared under abrupt and gradually changing gradient of PDGF.

AB An electrochemiluminescencent (ECL) biosensor was designed for the determination of insulin using a novel ECL resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET) strategy. In this strategy, carboxyl poly(9,9-dioctyfluorenyl-2,7-diyl) dots (PFO dots) were worked as ECL donor and 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracar-boxylic acid (PTCA) exploited as ECL acceptor, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) employed as the coreactant. The ECL donor and ECL acceptor were separately labeled with primary antibody (Ab(1)) and secondary antibody (Ab(2)), forming a sensing interface to the analyte target, insulin. In this expected sandwich-type ECL biosensor, PFO dots acted as sensing platform and PTCA employed as labels to quench the ECL emission of PFO dots. During the determination process, ECL signal of PFO dots was decreased in a gradual way by the increase of insulin concentration, and the quenching mechanism was also investigated. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the constructed biosensor exhibited an excellent performance, including a wide linear range from 1.0 x 10(-5) ng/mL to 1.0 x 10(2) ng/mL, low detection limit of 3.0 x 10(-6) ng/mL, good stability and selectivity for the detection of insulin. This pair of PFO-PTCA, as a new donor-acceptor pair in ECL-RET system, would provide a promising platform for bioanalysis in ECL field.

AB Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), as the cellular origin of metastasis, are cancer cells that break away from a primary tumor and circulate in the peripheral blood. And they provide a wealth of information about tumor phenotype. Here, this work reported a novel ultrasensitive immunoassay protocol for the detection of CTCs by using Pt@Ag nanoflowers (Pt@AgNFs) and AuNPs/Acetylene black (AuNPs/AB) nanomaterial. In the established approach, AuNPs/AB nanomaterial was used as substrate material to increase the specific surface area and enhance the conductivity of the gold electrode. Protein G was used for oriented immobilization of capture antibody, which strongly improved the capture efficiency of MCF-7 cells. The innovatively synthesized Pt@AgNFs by our group with high specific surface area and good biocompatibility were not only as the carriers of signal antibodies (Ab(2)) but also catalyzed the reduction of H2O2, which effectually amplified the current signal. A linear relationship between current signals and the concentrations of CTCs was obtained in the range from 20 to 1 x 10(6) cells mL(-1) and the detection limit is as low as 3 cells mL(-1) on condition of acceptable stability and reproducibility. Furthermore, the as-proposed cytosensor showed excellent performance in the detection of CTCs in human blood samples. These results suggest that the proposed cytosensor will be a promising application for accurately quantitative detection of CTCs.

AB We report an ultrasensitive electrochemical sensor for Hg2+ detection, on the basis of two Hg2+-specific oligonucleotide probes (a thiolated capture probe and a biotinated signal probe), "terminal" signal amplification of alkaline phosphatase catalyzed deposition of silver and in situ microliter-droplet anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). The thiolated capture probe is immobilized on an Au-plated glassy carbon electrode, and the biotinated signal probe is then attached to the electrode surface through the thymine-Hg2+-thymine interaction in the presence of Hg2+. A streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (ALP) composite is then immobilized on the electrode surface via biotin-streptavidin interaction. The immobilized ALP can catalyze the hydrolyzation of ascorbic acid 2-phosphate trisodium salt to generate ascorbic acid, which can reduce AgNO3 to form silver deposit on the modified electrode. Quantitative analysis of Hg2+ is conducted through microliter-droplet ASV of silver after its simultaneous chemical dissolution and cathodic preconcentration on the modified electrode. The sensor can linearly respond to the common logarithm of Hg2+ concentration from 0.1 nM to 250 mu M with a limit of detection of 0.01 nM (2 ppt, S/N = 3) and a sensitivity as high as 227 mu A dec(-1).

AB When excited over a periodic metamaterial lattice of gold nanoparticles (similar to 100 nm), localized plasmon resonances (LPR) can be coupled by a diffraction wave propagating along the array plane, which leads to a drastic narrowing of plasmon resonance lineshapes (down to a few nm full-width-at-half-maximum) and the generation of singularities of phase of reflected light. These phenomena look very promising for the improvement of performance of plasmonic biosensors, but conditions of implementation of such diffractively coupled plasmonic resonances, also referred to as plasmonic surface lattice resonances (PSLR), are not always compatible with biosensing arrangement implying the placement of the nanoparticles between a glass substrate and a sample medium (air, water). Here, we consider conditions of excitation and properties of PSLR over arrays of glass substrate-supported single and double Au nanoparticles (similar to 100-200 nm), arranged in a periodic metamaterial lattice, in direct and Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) geometries, and assess their sensitivities to variations of refractive index (RI) of the adjacent sample dielectric medium. First, we identify medium (PSLRair, PSLRwat for air and water, respectively) and substrate (PSLRsub) modes corresponding to the coupling of individual plasmon oscillations at medium- and substrate-related diffraction cut-off edges. We show that spectral sensitivity of medium modes to RI variations is determined by the lattice periodicity in both direct and ATR geometries (similar to 320 nm per RIU change in our case), while substrate mode demonstrates much lower sensitivity. We also show that phase sensitivity of PSLR can exceed 10(5) degrees of phase shift per RIU change and thus outperform the relevant parameter for all other plasmonic sensor counterparts. We finally demonstrate the applicability of surface lattice resonances in plasmonic metamaterial arrays to biosensing using standard streptavidin-biotin affinity model. Combining advantages of nanoscale architectures, including drastic concentration of electric field, possibility of manipulation at the nanoscale etc, and high phase and spectral sensitivities, PSLRs promise the advancement of current state-of-the-art plasmonic biosensing technology toward single molecule label-free detection.

AB Herein a label-free immunosensor based on electrolyte-gated organic field-effect transistor (EGOFET) was developed for the detection of procalcitonin (PCT), a sepsis marker. Antibodies specific to PCT were immobilized on the poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) organic semiconductor surface through direct physical adsorption followed by a post-treatment with bovine serum albumin (BSA) which served as the blocking agent to prevent nonspecific adsorption. Antibodies together with BSA (forming the whole biorecognition layer) served to selectively capture the procalcitonin target analyte. The entire immunosensor fabrication process was fast, requiring overall 45 min to be completed before analyte sensing. The EGOFET immunosensor showed excellent electrical properties, comparable to those of bare P3HT based EGOFET confirming reliable biosensing with bio-functional EGOFET immunosensor. The detection limit of the immunosensor was as low as 2.2 pM and within a range of clinical relevance. The relative standard deviation of the individual calibration data points, measured on immunosensors fabricated on different chips (reproducibility error) was below 7%. The developed immunosensor showed high selectivity to the PCT analyte which was evident through control experiments. This report of PCT detection is first of its kind among the electronic sensors based on EGOFETs. The developed sensor is versatile and compatible with low-cost fabrication techniques.

AB Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an important reactive oxygen species (ROS), is related to the oxidative stress in organisms, and plays important roles in a variety of cellular activities as well. So it is of crucial importance to develop sensitive and accurate sensing strategies to detect H2O2 in biological systems. Herein, by taking advantage of the unique emission characteristics of aggregation induced emission (ME) fluorogen, we proposed a non-enzymatic fluorescence platform for facile and sensitive detection of H2O2, both in solution state using fluorescence spectrometer and on paper-based sensor via visual inspection. Through the reaction between L-cysteine and H2O2, the fluorescence of TPE-M-L, an AIE fluorogen formed between maleimide-functionalized tetraphenylethene (TPE-M) and L-cysteine, is quenched, and highly sensitive non-enzymatic H2O2 assay is readily carried out. The limit of detection (LOD) of 10 nM in solution state and 2.5 mu M on paper-based sensor were obtained for H2O2 detection, which were superior or comparable to those previously reported in literature. Moreover, by integrating glucose oxidase with the ME fluorogen of TPE-M-L, highly sensitive and selective glucose detection was also conveniently achieved both in solution state and on paper-based sensor by the as proposed strategy, with the LODs of 50 nM in solution state and 10 mu M via visual observation, much better than those obtained by other fluorescence methods. The as-proposed sensing strategy was also successfully applied to assay glucose in human serum samples. Therefore, the paper-based fluorescence sensor exhibits the advantages of simple fabrication, high sensitivity and portability, and has great potential to be applied in on-site assay of H2O2 and glucose in real samples.

AB Rapidly fabricated, disposable sensor platforms hold tremendous promise for point-of-care detection. Here, we present an inexpensive (< $0.25) fully inkjet printed electrochemical sensor with integrated counter, reference, and working electrodes that is easily scalable for commercial fabrication. The electrochemical sensor platform featured an inkjet printed gold working 8-electrode array (WEA) and counter electrode (CE), along with an inkjet -printed silver electrode that was chlorinated with bleach to produce a Ag/AgCl quasi-reference electrode (RE). As proof of concept, the electrochemical sensor was successfully applied for detection of clinically relevant breast cancer biomarker Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER-2). Capture antibodies were bound to a chemically modified surface on the WEA and placed into a microfluidic device. A full sandwich immunoassay was constructed following a simultaneous injection of target protein, biotinylated antibody, and polymerized horseradish peroxide labels into the microfluidic device housing the WEA. With an ultra fast assay time, of only 15 mins a clinically relevant limit of detection of 12 pg mL(-1) was achieved. Excellent reproducibility and sensitivity were observed through recovery assays preformed in human serum with recoveries ranging from 76% to 103%. These easily fabricated and scalable electrochemical sensor platforms can be readily adapted for multiplex detection following this rapid assay protocol for cancer diagnostics.

AB The study focuses the dose administration of dabigatran to avoid the deaths due to hemorrhagic complications and thromboembolic stroke in clinics worldwide. To target the issue, a novel emerging acoustic technology, namely "Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation" (QCM-D) has been applied, while the acoustic assays namely "activated Partial Thromboplastin Time" (aPTT) and "Prothrombinase complex-induced Clotting Test" (PiCT) have been compared with the standard methods in parallel. Both techniques have been applied to 300 samples, including 220 plasma samples of patients suffering coagulation disorders and 80 plasma samples of non-patients. In comparison, the coagulation times of the acoustic aPTT and PiCT yielded an excellent correlation with the standard methods with in analytical standard deviation limits. Finally, the acoustic aPTT assay is the "gold standard" for a dose administration of the new oral anticoagulant, where the Delta f/Delta Gamma ratio of the acoustic assay demonstrates that dabigatran with FEIBA 50 combination could be a safe remedy to avoid the deaths in clinics.

AB A novel diphenylalaninamid (FFA) based peptide nanoparticles (PNPs) modified pencil graphite electrodes (PGEs) for construction of electrochemical cytosensor was demonstrated for the first time in this study. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images revealed the spherical nanostructure of the synthesized FFA based PNPs while attenuated total reflectance-fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra provided information about the structure and conformation of proteins in their structure. Self assembly of PNPs on PGE surface and adhesion of DLD-1 cancer cells on this surface was also characterized by electrochemical measurements. PNP/PGE5 acted as a sensitive platform for simple and rapid quantification of low concentration of DLD-1 cancer cells in early diagnosis using the electrochemical impedance method (EIS). The offered cytosensor demonstrated outstanding performance for the detection of DLD-1 cells by the EIS method. The impedance of electronic transduction was associated with the amount of the immobilized cells ranging from 2 x 10(2) to 2.0 x 10(5) cells mL(-1) with a limit of detection of 100 cells mL(-1). The efficient performance of the cytosensor was attributed to the well-defined nanostructure and biocompability of PNPs on the substrate.

AB In this work, we reported the synthesis of 3, 6-diamino-9-ethylcarbazole and its application as a new monomer for preparation of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) electrochemical sensor. The as prepared MIP sensor exhibited ultrahigh sensitivity and selectivity for the detection of 17-beta-estradiol in attomolar levels (1 x 10(-18) mol L-1). The sensor works by detecting the change of the interfacial impedance that is derived from recognition of 17-beta-estradiol on the MIP layer. The MIP sensor based on 3, 6-diamino-9-ethylcarbazole monomer revealed better performance than that of unmodified carbazole monomer. The monomer/template ratio, electropolymerization scanning cycles, and the incubation pH values were optimised in order to obtain the best detection efficiency. Under the optimised condition, the MIP sensor exhibits a wide linear range from 1 aM to 10 mu M (1 x 10(-18)-1 x 10(-5) mol L-1). A low detection limit of 0.36 aM (3.6 x 10(-19) mol L-1) and a good selectivity towards structurally similar compounds were obtained. The proposed MIP sensor also exhibits long-term stability and applicability in human serum samples. These advantages enabled this MIP sensor to be a promising alternative of electrochemical sensor and may be extended to detection of other endogenous compounds.

AB In this work, a spore-based biosensor is evaluated to monitor the microbicidal efficacy of sterilization processes applying gaseous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The sensor is based on interdigitated electrode structures (IDES) that have been fabricated by means of thin-film technologies. Impedimetric measurements are applied to study the effect of sterilization process on spores of Bacillus atrophaeus. This resilient microorganism is commonly used in industry to proof the sterilization efficiency. The sensor measurements are accompanied by conventional microbiological challenge tests, as well as morphological characterizations with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The sensor measurements are correlated with the microbiological test routines. In both methods, namely the sensor-based and microbiological one, a tailing effect has been observed. The results are evaluated and discussed in a three-dimensional calibration plot demonstrating the sensor's suitability to enable a rapid process decision in terms of a successfully performed sterilization.

To begin with, we briefly discussed the fundamental synthesis approaches for advanced thin films with an emphasis on the properties necessary for controlled fabrication (e.g., the elemental ratio and spatial arrangement). Subsequently, we explored the control, characterization, and optimization of hybrid porous thin films with respect to diverse sensing applications. The application of hybrid porous thin film materials has also been discussed in relation to the mechanisms used for biological, optical, electrical, acoustic, and other advanced sensing techniques (e.g., surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)). Finally, conclusions are drawn to highlight the current status of thin film-based sensing technology along with its opportunities and challenges.

AB Herein, we report an optical sensing platform for mercury ions (Hg2+) in water based on the integration of Hg2+-mediated thymine-thymine (T-T) stabilization, a biotinylated stem-loop DNA probe, and a streptavidin-modified retroreflective Janus particle (SA-RJP). Two oligonucleotide probes, including a stem-loop DNA probe and an assistant DNA probe, were utilized. In the absence of Hg2+, the assistant DNA probe does not hybridize with the stem-loop probe due to their T-T mismatch, so the surface-immobilized stem-loop DNA probe remains a closed hairpin structure. In the presence of Hg2+, the DNA forms a double-stranded structure with the loop region via Hg2+-mediated T-T stabilization. This DNA hybridization induces stretching of the stem-loop DNA probe, exposing biotin. To translate these Hg2+-mediated structural changes in DNA probe into measurable signal, SA-RJP, an optical signaling label, is applied to recognize the exposed biotin. The number of biospecifically bound SA-RJPs is proportional to the concentration of Hg2+, so that the concentration of Hg2+ can be quantitatively analyzed by counting the number of RIPs. Using the system, a highly selective and sensitive measurement of Hg2+ was accomplished with a limit of detection of 0.027 nM. Considering the simplified optical instrumentation required for retroreflection-based RJP counting, RJP-assisted Hg2+ measurement can be accomplished in a much easier and inexpensive manner. Moreover, the detection of Hg2+ in real drinking water samples including tap and commercial bottled water was successfully carried out.

AB A sensitive and selective electrochemical Hg2+ sensor was developed based on T-Hg2+-T structure and exonuclease (Exo) III -assisted target recycling amplification at heated gold disk electrode (HAuDE). First, a DNA signal probe P1 was for the first time designed and labeled with ferrocene (Fc) near the attached SH-5'-end, so as to shorten the distance between Fc and the electrode and enhance the initial current of Fc compared with that labeled at the 3'-end far from the electrode. Then the signal amplification was achieved by Exo III-assisted Hg2+ recycling. Briefly, the P1 was complementary to the assistant DNA P2 except the T-T mismatches. In the presence of Hg2+, the P1 self-assembled on the HAuDE could hybridize with P2 and form DNA duplex with blunt end at the 3'-terminus, triggering Exo III to stepwise digest mononucleotides from the 3'-terminus of P1, ultimately liberating Hg2+ and P2, which could be "recycled", resulting in the digestion of a large amount of P1 and significantly decrease the amount of Fc. The electrochemical signal difference before and after digestion was proportional to the Hg2+ concentration. Furthermore, during the digestion period, the Exo III activity could be significantly increased by elevating the electrode temperature, great improving the sensitivity and efficiency for Hg2+ detection. A detection limit of 6.2 pM (S/N = 3) could be obtained with an electrode temperature of 40 degrees C during 60 min digestion period, which was lower ca. two magnitudes than that at 0 degrees C and one magnitude than that at 25 degrees C.

AB It is important to design a nice electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biological nanomaterial for fabricating sensitive ECL immunosensor to detect tumor markers. Most reported ECL nanomaterial was decorated by a number of mono-luminophore. Here, we report a novel ECL nanomaterial assembled by dual luminophores perylenetetracarboxylic acid (PTCA) and carbon quantum dots (CQDs). In the ECL nanomaterial, graphene was chosen as nanocarrier. Significant ECL intensity increases are seen in the ECL nanomaterial, which was interpreted with the proposed synergistic promotion ECL meachanism of PTCA and CQDs. Furthermore, this ECL nanomaterial was used to label secondary antibody and fabricate a sandwiched carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) immunosensor. The CEA immunosensor exhibits high sensitivity and the linear semilogarithmical range was from 0.001 fg mL(-1) to 1 ng(-1) with low detection limit 0.00026 fg mL(-1). And the CEA immunosensor is also suitable for various cancers' sample detection providing potential specific applications in diagnostics.

AB Ferritin is an iron cage having protein, capable of extracting metal ions in their cages and a consequence of the electron transfer of metal ions in their cage by reduction and oxidation processes, electrochemical information storage devices can be designed. In this work, ferritin based protein biomemory substrate has been synthesized by using Amino Acid (monomer) Decorated and Light Underpinning Conjugation Approach (ANADOLUCA) method, which utilizes photosensitive electron transfer based microemulsion co-polymerization as nanobead form of ferritin. Protein substrate contains metal ions such as silver and copper or metal ion pairs namely, silver copper (Janus bionanocage) and co-polymeric shell of the photosensitive crosslinker protein. The redox behavior of bionanocages differentiates electrochemical "writing" and "erase states depending on these metal ions (silver or copper) or metal ion pairs. The bionanocages based biomemory substrates have been immobilized using graphene modified glassy carbon electrodes and the memory functions of ferritin based bionanocages have been confirmed by chronoamperometry (CA) and open circuit potential amperometry (OCPA). The stability and durability of multi-state memory devices represent promising properties for future bioelectronic information technologies.

AB Electrochemical aptamer (EA) sensors based on aptamer-cDNA duplex probes (cDNA: complementary DNA) and target induced strand displacement (TISD) recognition are sensitive, selective and capable of detecting a wide variety of target analytes. While substantial research efforts have focused on engineering of new signaling mechanisms for the improvement of sensor sensitivity, little attention was paid to the enhancement of sensor response rate. Typically, the previous TISD based EA sensors exhibited relatively long response times larger than 30 min, which mainly resulted from the suboptimal aptamer-cDNA probe structure in which most of aptamer bases were paired to the cDNA bases. In an effort to improve the response rate of this type of sensors, we report here the rational engineering of a quickly responsive and sensitive aptamer-cDNA probe by employing the conception of bivalent interaction in supramolecular chemistry. We design a bivalent cDNA strand through linking two short monovalent cDNA sequences, and it is simultaneously hybridized to two electrode-immobilized aptamer probes to form a bivalent binding (BB) aptamer-cDNA probe. This class of BB probe possesses the advantages of less aptamer bases paired to the cDNA bases for quick response rate and good structural stability for high sensor sensitivity. By use of the rationally designed BB aptamer-cDNA probe, a TISD based EA sensor against ATP with significantly enhanced response rate (with a displacement equilibrium time of 4 min) and high sensitivity was successfully constructed. We believe that our BB probe conception will help guide future designs and applications of TISD based EA sensors.

AB An optoelectronic sensor is a rapid diagnostic tool that allows for an accurate, reliable, field-portable, low-cost device for practical applications. In this study, template-free In situ gold nanobundles (Au NBs) were fabricated on an electrode for optoelectronic sensing of fowl adenoviruses (FAdVs). Au NB film was fabricated on carbon electrodes working area using L(+) ascorbic acid, gold chroloauric acid and poly-L-lysine (PLL) through modified layer-by-layer (LbL) method. A scanning electron microscopic (SEM) image of the Au NBs revealed a NB shaped Au structure with many kinks on its surface, which allow local electric field enhancement through light-matter interaction with graphene quantum dots (GQDs). Here, GQDs were synthesized through an autoclave-assisted method. Characterization experiments revealed blue-emissive, well-dispersed GQDs that were 2-3 nm in size with the fluorescence emission peak of GQDs located at 405 nm. Both Au NBs and GQDs were conjugated with target FAdVs specific antibodies that bring them close to each other with the addition of target FAdVs through antibody-antigen interaction. At close proximity, light-matter interaction between Au NBs and QDs produces a local electric signal enhancement under Ultraviolet-visible (UV-visible) light irradiation that allows the detection of very low concentrations of target virus even in complex biological media. A proposed optoelectronic sensor showed a linear relationship between the target FAdVs and the electric signal up to 10 Plaque forming unit (PFU)/mL with a limit of detection (LOD) of 8.75 PFU/mL. The proposed sensing strategy was 100 times more sensitive than conventional ELISA method.

AB The sensitive quantification of Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2), as a key prognostic tumor marker, plays a critical role in screening, early diagnosis and management of breast cancer. This paper describes a sandwich-type immunoassay with silver signal enhancement strategy for highly sensitive detection of HER2. For this purpose, the target capturing step was designed by functionalization of 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane coated magnetite nanoparticles with antibody (antiHER2/APTMS-Fe3O4), as a platform bioconjugate (PB), and immobilized at a bare GCE. Then, in the presence of label-free immunosensor, the PB was covered by magnetic gold nanoparticles self-assembled with thiolated antibodies (antiHER2/Hyd@AuNPs-APTMS-Fe3O4) containing chemically reduced silver ions, as a label bioconjugate (LB). Under optimum conditions, a linear relationship between the differential pulse voltammetric (DPV) stripping signal of silver and the logarithm of HER2 concentrations was obtained in the range of 5.0 x 10(-4)-50.0 ng mL(-1) (R-2 = 0.9906) with a detection limit of 2.0 x 10(-5) ng mL(-1). The effectiveness of this protocol was evaluated experimentally through employing of designed immunosensor for detection of the serum level of tumor marker. The good consistency of the results with those obtained by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) conventional method (p-value of < 0.05) showed that this immunosensor can be applied for the testing of HER2 in clinical samples of breast cancer patients.

AB Herein, a novel methodology for ultrasensitive and facile breast cancer biomarker carbohydrate antigen 15-3 (CA15.3) evaluation was proposed by fabricating a sandwiched ECL immunosensor. In the protocol, MOCs-Fc and Pt@BSA-luminol nanohybrids were successfully synthesized and further employed to achieve dual-amplification strategy for luminol-H2O2 system. Notably, inherent porous microstructure and large specific surface area from MOCs enabled a high loading of Fc, which succeeded in catalyzing luminol-H2O2 ECL emission and therefore enhancing ECL response. In addition, higher sensitivity could be realized due to the excellent electronic conductivity of MOCs. Furthermore, the as-obtained Pt@BSA-luminol was not only employed as capture probe to recognize CA15-3 after hybridization with Ab(2), but also played a crucial role in acting as ECL signal probe due to the presence of massive luminol. It is of vital importance that Pt@BSA core/shell nanospheres showed admirable catalytic effect towards H2O2, which resulted in more excited state luminol and stronger ECL intensity. Therefore, the synergistic amplification strategy of MOCs-Fc and Pt@BSA nanohybrids offered an extremely enhanced ECL signal. The well-established applicable ECL immune-sensing platform displayed favorable analytical performance for CA15-3. In summary, the proposed ECL immunosensor opened a new era for sensitive CA15-3 evaluation and offered a promising platform for clinical breast cancer diagnostics.

AB In the past few years, magnetoelectronics has emerged as a promising new platform technology in various biosensors for detection, identification, localisation and manipulation of a wide spectrum of biological, physical and chemical agents. The methods are based on the exposure of the magnetic field of a magnetically labelled biomolecule interacting with a complementary biomolecule bound to a magnetic field sensor. This Review presents various schemes of magnetic biosensor techniques from both simulation and modelling as well as analytical and numerical analysis points of view, and the performance variations under magnetic fields at steady and nonstationary states. This is followed by magnetic sensors modelling and simulations using advanced Multiphysics modelling software (e.g. Finite Element Method (FEM) etc.) and home-made developed tools. Furthermore, outlook and future directions of modelling and simulations of magnetic biosensors in different technologies and materials are critically discussed.

AB Visual inspection is expected as an ideal technique, which can directly and conveniently detect heavy metal ions by observing the color change. Insensitivity of detecting weakly colored heavy transition metal ions and low adsorptivity of metal ions on nanoparticle surface are two main factors hindering the application of visual detection in heavy metal ions detection. Herein, we demonstrated an operational colorimetric sensor based on the color dependence of nanoparticles aggregation to selective and facile detect weakly colored transition heavy metal Cd2+ ions that have been considered as the origin of the "Itai-itai" disease. Uniform colloidal 15 nm graphite-like nitride doped carbon quantum dots-capped gold nanoparticle (Au@g-CNQDs) was successfully prepared, wherein the existence of numerous heptazine, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticle's surface strengthened adsorption of the Cd2+ ions on the surface of Au@g-CNQDs through the "cooperative effect". As a consequence, without expensive and intricate exogenous indicators or other special additives, the Cd2+ ions could sensitively and quickly captured to detect at ultra-low concentration within 30 s by the naked-eye. Under the optimal conditions, the Cd2+ ions sensor possesses good analytical performances with a wide linear range of 0.01-3.0 mu M and a detection limit of 10 nM (S/N = 3). Moreover, the biodistribution and aggregation of Cd2+ ions were detected effectively in mice organ tissues suggesting its great potential use for real word applications.

AB In order to understanding the pathogenic mechanism of infectious diseases, it was important to study the selective recognition and interaction between pathogenic bacteria and host cells. In this paper, a novel electrochemical impedance biosensor was proposed, in which the Man/MUA-MH/Au sensing surface (Man: mannose; MUA: 11-mercapto eleven acid; MH: 6-mercapto hexanol) was fabricated and was of good biologically active and stability. The capture capacity of the designed sensing surface for S. typhimurium ATCC14028, E. coli JM109 and E. coil DH5 alpha were characterized by Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). According to Randless equivalent circuit and the Frumkin isotherm model, electron transfer impedance (Rat) was obtained and the binding affinity of the three bacteria and Man was calculated. It was shown that the sensing surface had a better binding affinity for S. typhimurium ATCC14028 with K-ADS(S.T.) = 2.16 x 10(6) CFU/mL. The impedance normalized value NIC ((s.T.Man)) was of a good linear relationship with the logarithm of bacterial concentration (R-2 = 0.96) in the range of 50-1000 CFU/mL. The detection limit was 50 CFU/mL. Meanwhile, the E. coil JM109 which expresses type 1 fimbriae was also adsorbed on the designed sensing surface with K-ADS(JM109) = 5.84 x 10(3) CFU/mL. It was illustrated that the novel electrochemical impedance biosensor could be more rapid and reliable for studying interactions between pathogen and glycan, and it was also perspective for a new point-of-care diagnostic tool for evaluating the pathogenicity bacteria.

AB An electrochemical biosensor was developed based on a steric hindrance hybridization assay to allow the highly sensitive detection of streptavidin. In the stark hindrance hybridization assay, the signaling strand DNA (sig-DNA) was labeled at the 3' end with CdSe quantum dots (QDs) and at the 5' end with biotin, and capturing strand DNA (the complementary strand of sig-DNA) was labeled at the 5' end with thiol. The steric hindrance effect generated by streptavidin which was bound with the signaling DNA strand. The streptavidin limited the ability of the sig-DNA to hybridize with the cap-DNA, which were linked on the surface of a gold electrode. Therefore, the concentration of streptavidin was detected indirectly based on the concentration of CdSe QDs on the electrode surface. The concentration of CdSe QDs on the electrode surface was detected by differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry. Under optimal conditions, the streptavidin detection range using the as-prepared biosensor was 1.96 pg/mL to 1.96 mu g/mL and the detection limit was 0.65 pg/mL. The experimental results showed that the electrochemical biosensor could detect streptavidin rapidly and accurately.

AB Introduction of novel functional nanomaterials and analytical technologies signify a foremost possibility for the advance of electrochemical sensor and biosensor platforms/devices for a broad series of applications including biological, biomedical, biotechnological, clinical and medical diagnostics, environmental and health monitoring, and food industries. The design of sensitive and selective electrochemical biological sensor platforms are accomplished conceivably by offering new surface modifications, microfabrication techniques, and diverse nanomaterials with unique properties for in vivo and in vitro medical analysis via relating a sensibly planned electrode/solution interface. The advantageous attributes such as low-cost, miniaturization, energy efficient, easy fabrication, online monitoring, and the simultaneous sensing capability are the driving force towards continued growth of electrochemical biosensing platforms, which have fascinated the interdisciplinary research arenas spanning chemistry, material science, biological science, and medical industries. The electrochemical biosensor platforms have potential applications in the early-stage detection and diagnosis of disease as stout and tunable diagnostic and therapeutic systems. The key aim of this review is to emphasize the newest development in the design of sensing and biosensing platforms based on functional nanomaterials for biological and biomedical applications. High sensitivity and selectivity, fast response, and excellent durability in biological media are all critical aspects which will also be wisely addressed. Potential applications of electrochemical sensor and biosensor platforms based on advanced functional nanomaterials for neuroscience diagnostics, clinical, point-of-care diagnostics and medical industries are also concisely presented.

AB Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death among chronic diseases worldwide. Therefore, it is important to be able to detect CVD biomarkers early so that patients can be diagnosed properly and begin treatment as soon as possible. To detect biomarkers more conveniently, point-of-care (PoC) biosensors, which are easy to use and are of low cost, are becoming even more necessary. This paper focuses on developing a label-free electrochemical biosensor with high sensitivity for PoC applications to detect CVD biomarkers such as 5100 beta proteins and C-reactive proteins (CRP).
   To meet the requirements of a PoC application and to improve the measurement sensitivity for detection purposes, a three-electrode configuration was miniaturized and fitted onto a biochip. Computer simulation of an electrolyte current density was used to investigate several potential effective possibilities. It was found that an electrolyte current density at an edge tip structure near the working electrode (WE) and counter electrode (CE) was higher than at other locations. A zigzag structure was then designed at the edge near the WE and CE positions. With this design, we can obtain a higher total electrolyte current. This newly-designed biochip was then used to measure the electrochemical feature. It was found that the measurement efficiency was also improved using this newly designed biochip.

AB Powering future generations of medical and health care devices mandates the transcutaneous transfer of energy or harvesting energy from the human body fluid. Glucose-driven bio fuel cells (bio-batteries) demonstrate promise as they produce electrical energy from glucose, which is a substrate presents in physiological fluids. Enzymatic biofuel cells can convert chemical energy into electrical energy using enzymes as catalysts. In this study, an air bio-battery was developed for healthcare and medical applications, consisting of a glucose-driven enzymatic biofuel cell using a direct gas-permeable membrane or a gas/liquid porous diaphragm. The power generation characteristics included a maximum current density of 285 mu A/cm(2) and maximum power density of 70.7 mu W/cm(2) in the presence of 5 mmol/L of glucose in solution. In addition, high-performance, long-term stabilized power generation was achieved using the gas/liquid porous diaphragm for the reactions between oxygen and enzyme. This system can be powered using 5 mmol/L of glucose, the value of which is similar to that of the blood sugar range in humans.

AB DNA hydrogel garnered increasing attention in the sensing and medical field owing to its native biocompatibility and mechanical stability. While electrochemistry serves as a quantitative and sensitive detection technique, electrochemical DNA hydrogel biosensor is rarely reported. Here, for the first time, we report an electrochemical biosensor based on hybrid DNA hydrogel immobilized on indium tin oxide/polyethylene terephthalate (ITO/PET) electrode for the detection of lung cancer-specific microFtNA, miR-21. The biosensor is capable of detecting miR-21 at a concentration as low as 5 nM (1 pmol) and linear read-out from 10 nM to 50 mu M. Ferrocene-tagged recognition probes were cross-linked with DNAs grafted on the polyacrylamide backbones to form the hybrid DNA hydrogel, which was further immobilized on 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (KH 570) treated ITO electrode. When the recognition probe was hybridized with the target miR-21, the hydrogel dissolved, producing a loss of ferrocene tags and a reduction in current, detected by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV). The material characteristics of the biosensor were verified using contact angle meter and Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS). This novel biosensor holds great promise in early sensitive clinical diagnosis for a variety of cancer-specific biomarkers due to the flexible sequence design of the recognition probe.

AB Cell types of erythrocytes should be identified because they are closely related to their functionality and viability. Conventional methods for classifying erythrocytes are time consuming and labor intensive. Therefore, an automatic and accurate erythrocyte classification system is indispensable in healthcare and biomedical fields. In this study, we proposed a new label-free sensor for automatic identification of erythrocyte cell types using a digital in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM) combined with machine learning algorithms. A total of 12 features, including information on intensity distributions, morphological descriptors, and optical focusing characteristics, is quantitatively obtained from numerically reconstructed holographic images. All individual features for discocytes, echinocytes, and spherocytes are statistically different. To improve the performance of cell type identification, we adopted several machine learning algorithms, such as decision tree model, support vector machine, linear discriminant classification, and k-nearest neighbor classification. With the aid of these machine learning algorithms, the extracted features are effectively utilized to distinguish erythrocytes. Among the four tested algorithms, the decision tree model exhibits the best identification performance for the training sets (n = 440, 98.18%) and test sets (n = 190, 97.37%). This proposed methodology, which smartly combined DIHM and machine learning, would be helpful for sensing abnormal erythrocytes and computer-aided diagnosis of hematological diseases in clinic.

AB Using heme entrapped in recombinant silk films, we have produced 3rd generation biosensors, which allow direct electron transfer from the heme center to an electrode avoiding the need for electron mediators. Here, we demonstrate the use of these heme-silk films for the detection of nitric oxide (NO) at nanomolar levels in the presence and absence of oxygen. The sensor was prepared by drop-casting a silk solution on a glassy carbon electrode modified with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) followed by infusion with heme. The sensor was characterized by cyclic voltammetry and showed well defined and reversible Fe+ / Fe+ redox couple activity, with NO detection by oxidation at potentials above +0.45 V or reduction at potentials below 0.7 V. Evaluation of the effect of pH on the sensor response to NO reduction indicated a maximum response at pH 3. The sensor showed good linearity in the concentration range from 19 to 190 nM (R-2 = 0.99) with a detection limit of 2 nM. The sensor had excellent selectivity towards NO with no or negligible interference from oxygen, nitrite, nitrate, dopamine and ascorbic acid and retained 86% of response after 2 months of operation and storage at room temperature.

AB 2'-O-methyl group on the 3' terminal nucleotide in plant microRNAs, as one kind of RNA methylations, is caused by HEN1 RNA methyltransferase (HENMT1), which is thought to be crucial for ribosome biogenesis and function. Herein, a simple and label-free PEC biosensing method was proposed for assay of HENMT1 activity and inhibitor screening based on peroxidase mimic PtCu nanoframes (PtCu NFs) catalytic signal amplification. In this work, MoS2@Graphene quantum dots/Phosphorus-doped rodlike carbon nitride (MoS2@GQDs/P-RCN) heterojunction was used as photoactive materials. With the doping of GQDs and the formation of heterojunction, the photoactivity of MoS2 is greatly improved. After the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) with 2 nt 3' overhangs was treated with HENMT1 in the presence of S-adenosyl-L-methionine, the 3' terminal nucleotide of the un-methylated dsRNA could be extended under the catalysis of the poly(U) polymerase in the existence of UTP. Poly (A) nucleotide chain modified with carboxyl group was captured on the electrode surface through hybridization reaction and acted as a bridge for the immobilization of reticular DNA-functionalized PtCu NFs (PtCu@DNA). Under the catalysis effect of peroxidase mimics PtCu@DNA towards hydrogen peroxide, O2- was in situ generated as electron donor and a strong photocurrent was obtained. The proposed PEC bioassay exhibited high selectivity and low detection limit of 3.36 ng/mL for HENMT1 activity assay. Furthermore, the inhibition research indicated that chlorpyrifos could inhibit the HENMT1 activity with the IC50 value of 48.32 nM.

AB An aldehyde functionalized ionic liquid, (3-(3-formyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate) (CHO-IL) has been employed herein as a multiple host platform for the covalent immobilization of mediator as well as enzyme. The CHO-IL was immobilized on electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) through the pi-pi stacking of hydroxybenzyl and imidazolium groups with ERGO and subjected to further covalent attachment of Azure A (Azu-A) mediator or glucose oxidase (GOx) enzyme. Electroactive, water soluble organic dye Azu-A was effectively immobilized to the host IL through simple Schiff base reaction. Azu-A was rendered leak-free in the electrode setup and also responded well for the amperometric determination of H2O2 over a linear range of 0.03-1 mM with a detection limit and sensitivity of 11.5 mu M and 133.2 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), respectively. Further, attempts were made to explore the CHO-IL platform for the covalent immobilization of GOx enzyme which served well in retaining the enzyme nativity, reactivity and stability. Under optimized conditions, mediatorless GOx biosensor developed based on direct electrochemistry has exhibited an impressive analytical signal towards glucose detection in the linear range of 0.05-2.4 mM with a detection limit and sensitivity of 17 mu M and 17.7 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), respectively. The reliability of the proposed Azu-A based chemical sensor and GOx based biosensor towards the determination of H2O2 and glucose in the real samples have been demonstrated. The remarkable analytical parameters and long term stability of both the sensors could be envisioned as a result of facile immobilization platform and immobilization strategy.

AB Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is one of the most important technologies for biochemical analysis critical for diagnosis and monitoring of many diseases. Traditional systems for ELISA incubation and reading are expensive and bulky, thus cannot be used at point-of-care or in the field. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new miniature mobile phone based system for ELISA (MELISA). This system can be used to complete all steps of the assay, including incubation and reading. It weighs just 1 pound, can be fabricated at low cost, portable, and can transfer test results via mobile phone. We successfully demonstrated how MELISA can be calibrated for accurate measurements of progesterone and demonstrated successful measurements with the calibrated system.

AB Methylglyoxal (MG) is a predominant precursor for advanced glycation end products (AGEs) due to its protein glycation reactions, which are the major causes of diabetic complications. MG is explored as a significant biomarker towards the prediction of diabetic complications. With this background, a non-enzymatic electrochemical biosensor has been developed to detect MG in human blood plasma samples. Microwave synthesized V2O5 nanoplates were used as interface material in the fabrication of modified gold (Au) working electrode for electrochemical MG biosensor. Orthorhombic crystal structured V2O5 with an oxidation state of +5 exhibited specific MG sensing performance. Cyclic voltammetry and amperometry studies confirmed the electrocatalytic nature of V2O5 nanoplates modified Au electrode in the detection of MG. Non-enzymatic V2O5 modified Au electrode showed a sensitivity of 4.519 mu A mu M-1 with a linear range of 3-30 mu M, limit of detection (LOD) of 0.24 mu M, limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.80 mu M and a response time less than 8 s towards MG. The lifetime and percentage recovery of the sensor was found to be 25 days (90%) and 102.5-108.7% respectively.

AB A sensitive label-free electrochemical immunosensor was designed using a novel signal amplification system for quantitative detecting hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) supported surfactant-free AuPdCu ternary nanoparticles (AuPdCu/N-GQDs), which featured with good conductivity and excellent catalytic properties for the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), was synthesized by a simple and benign hydrothermal procedure. At the same time, the electroactive polymer nanospheres (PS) was synthesized by infinite coordination polymers of ferrocenedicarboxylic acid, which could play as carrier and electronic mediator to load AuPdCu/N-GQDs. The PS not only improved the ability to load antibodies because of the good biocompatibility, but also accelerated electron transport of the electrode interface attribute to plentiful ferrocene unit. Thus, the prepared AuPdCu/N-GQDs@PS has abilities of good biocompatibility, catalytic activity and electrical conductivity to be applied as transducing materials to amplify electrochemical signal in detection of HBsAg. Under optimal conditions, the fabricated immunosensor exhibited high sensitivity and stability in the detection of HBsAg. A linear relationship between current signals and the concentrations of HBsAg was obtained in the range from 10 fg/mL to 50 ng/mL and the detection limit of HBsAg was 3.3 fg/mL (signal-to-noise ratio of 3). Moreover, the designed immunosensor with excellent selectivity, reproducibility and stability shows excellent performance in detection of human serum samples. Furthermore, this label-free electrochemical immunosensor has promising application in clinical diagnosis of HBsAg.

AB The presence of a single-nucleotide polymorphism in Apolipoprotein E4 gene is implicated with the increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, detection of AD-related DNA oligonucleotide sequence associated with Apolipoprotein E4 gene sequence was achieved using localized-surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) on 2D-Photonic crystal (2D-PC) and Au-coated 2D-PC surfaces. 2D-PC surfaces were fabricated on a flexible copolymer film using nano-imprint lithography (NIL). The film surface was then coated with a dual-functionalized polymer to react with surface immobilized DNA probe. DNA hybridization was detected by monitoring the optical responses of either a Fresnel decrease in reflectance on 2D-PC surfaces or an increase in LSPR on Au-coated 2D-PC surfaces. The change in response due to DNA hybridization on the modified surfaces was also investigated using mismatched and non-complementary oligonucleotides sequences. The proof-of concept results are promising towards the development of 2D-PC on copolymer film surfaces as miniaturized and wearable biosensors for various diagnostic and defense applications.

AB L-lactate biosensors employing L-lactate oxidase (LOx) have been developed mainly to measure L-lactate concentration for clinical diagnostics, sports medicine, and the food industry. Some L-lactate biosensors employ artificial electron mediators, but these can negatively impact the detection of L-lactate by competing with the primary electron acceptor: molecular oxygen. In this paper, a strategic approach to engineering an AvLOx that minimizes the effects of oxygen interference on sensor strips was reported. First, we predicted an oxygen access pathway in Aerococcus viridans LOx (AvLOx) based on its crystal structure. This was subsequently blocked by a bulky amino acid substitution. The resulting Ala96Leu mutant showed a drastic reduction in oxidase activity using molecular oxygen as the electron acceptor and a small increase in dehydrogenase activity employing an artificial electron acceptor. Secondly, the Ala96Leu mutant was immobilized on a screen-printed carbon electrode using glutaraldehyde cross-linking method. Amperometric analysis was performed with potassium ferricyanide as an electron mediator under argon or atmospheric conditions. Under argon condition, the response current increased linearly from 0.05 to 0.5 mM L-lactate for both wild-type and Ala96Leu. However, under atmospheric conditions, the response of wild-type AvLOx electrode was suppressed by 9-12% due to oxygen interference. The Ala96Leu mutant maintained 56-69% of the response current at the same L-lactate level and minimized the relative bias error to 19% from 49% of wild-type. This study provided significant insight into the enzymatic reaction mechanism of AvLOx and presented a novel approach to minimize oxygen interference in sensor applications, which will enable accurate detection of L-lactate concentrations.

AB The main obstacle in realization of a totally implantable hearing aid is a lack of reliable implantable microphone. In this paper we have described a potentially miniature fiber-optic vibrometer based on a modified Michelson interferometer, designed to serve as a middle-ear microphone for totally implantable cochlear- or middle-ear hearing aids. A model of the sensing system was used for in-vitro and in-vivo investigation of acoustical response of sheep's middle-ear ossicles. Surgical and implantation procedure of introducing the sensing optical fiber into the middle-ear and its aiming at the incus was investigated and described here in detail. The frequency responses of the incus was measured while a cadaver and living sheep was exposed to the sinusoidal acoustical excitation of 40-90 dB SPL, in the frequency range from 100 Hz to 10 kHz. The amplitude of the incus vibration was found to be in the range between 10 pm to 100 nm, strongly depending on the frequency, with a lot of resonant peaks, corresponding mainly to the natural outer ear canal gain. The noise floor in the experiments was about 2 pm/Hz(1/2), but recently we have decreased it to < 0.5 pm/Hz(1/2), which corresponds to a minimal detectable sound level of 31-35 dB(A) SPL for humans. The histological examination of temporal bones of cadaver animals and the intensity of in-vivo optical signal demonstrated that the aiming of the sensing fiber to the target has been preserved for five months after the implantation.

AB Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents have become a necessary part for clinical practice to improve the sensitivity for the diagnosis of small lesions and injuries. Among them, manganese oxide nanoparticle (MnO NPs)-based Mill contrast agent attracts more and more attention because of their better performance in the detection of brain disease and positive enhancement in T-1-weighted image. However, the relatively low r(1) relaxivity and complex synthetic route hampered their wider applications. In this work, we proposed a one-pot approach to prepare hydrophilic MnO NPs via a polyol-like method with poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) as both a solvent and surfactant. The obtained PEG-MnO NPs displayed a high T-1 relaxivity and a low r(2)/r(1) ratio (12.942 s(-1) mM(-1) and 4.66) at 3.0 T, which was three times that of the clinical used contrast agent, Magnevist (Gd-DTPA). Additionally, when exposed to the simulated body fluid (SBF), acidic environment or glutathione, PEG-MnO NPs kept stable, favoring their further biological applications. Then, to explore their use for the molecular magnetic resonance imaging of 786-0 renal carcinoma, amino group modified AS1411 aptamer as the targeting molecule was introduced to conjugate with PEG-MnO NPs via covalent coupling reaction. The fabricated nanoprobe, AS1411-PEG-MnO, could clearly visualize 786.0 renal carcinoma cells with MRI in vitro. Furthermore, compared with PEG-MnO NPs, AS1411-PEG-MnO nanoprobe presented a prolonged retention in 786-0 renal carcinoma tumor in vivo. The intravenously injected nanoprobes were eventually excreted from the body through the renal clearance route. These results indicated the potential promising of PEG-Mn0 NPs as an alternative contrast agent in MRI scanning.

AB Here, we for the first time used a thiolated amino-ligand modified multi-branched gold nanoflower as skeleton to encapsulate iron porphyrins (AuNF@FeTPPC1) as alternatives to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). After the FeTPPC1 encapsulation, the HRP mimicking activity of FeTPPC1 was effectively blocked by the steric hindrance of the hydrophobic layer on the AuNF surface. Upon the addition of ethanol, the loaded FeTPPC1 was released into the solution in its free format and exposed the catalytic sites, resulting in the recovery of catalytic activity. The proposed encapsulation method effectively avoided the loss of catalytic activity that originated from the blocking of the catalytic active sites during immobilization. Additionally, the resultant AuNF@FeTPPC1 nano composite exhibited a high loading level with 2.4 x 10(6) FeTPPC1 molecules per AuNF, and showed considerably high catalytic activity for hydrogen peroxide and 3, 3' 5, 5'-tetramethylbenzidine, which is approximately 40 and 172-folds higher than native HRP. Through using the as-prepared AuNF@FeTPPC1 as an alternative of HRP for trace labeling, we successfully developed calorimetric immunosensors for fumonisin B-1 (FB1) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) with competitive and sandwich-type formats, respectively. The developed AuNF@FeTPPC1-based colorimetric immunosensor exhibited higher detection sensitivity for FB1 and HBsAg than the corresponding HRP-based immunosensors. Thus, the proposed AuNF@FeTPPC1 can be used as HRP mimicking analogs for developing highly sensitive colorimetric immunosensor and for loading other hydrophobic iron porphyrins or catalysts.

AB Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are tailor made recognition materials that can mimic biological receptors. If used as recognition units for chemosensors fabrication, they outperform natural receptors with their durability, chemical stability, and low production costs. Novel techniques of MIP deposition as thin films, surface development, and introduction of additional properties are very much demanded in terms of selective and sensitive chemosensors fabrication. Therefore, in recent years a particular attention has been paid to syntheses of nanostructured MIP films and MIP nanoparticles. The present brief review surveys novel achievements in the field of MIP nanostructures and their application for determination of protein analytes.

AB In this study, a novel wax-printed paper-based lateral flow device has been developed as an alternative approach for an automated and one-step enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The design pattern consisted of a non-delayed channel, a wax-delayed channel, a test zone and a control zone. This system was easily fabricated on a nitrocellulose membrane using a wax-printing method and then baked in an oven at 100 degrees C for 1 min. The four barriers of the wax-delayed channel could delay the flow time for 11 s compared to the flow time of the non delayed channel. To use the device under optimal conditions, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was detected at a limit of detection of 1 ng mL(-1) and assessed with the naked eye within 10 min. A colorimetric intensity was also measured using a smart phone and computer software at a linear range of 0.1-100 ng mL(-1) with a good correlation. Furthermore, the proposed device was successfully applied to detect AFP in human serum. Therefore, the wax-printing demonstrates a user-friendly, easy and quick method for the fabrication of the device, which could be used as a one-step, portable, disposable, low-cost, simple, instrument-free and point-of-care device for the automated ELISA.

AB Sensitive and selective detection of microRNAs (miRNAs) in cancer cells derived exosomes have attracted rapidly growing interest owing to their potential in diagnostic and prognostic applications. Here, we design a ratiometric electrochemical biosensor based on bipedal DNA walkers for the attomolar detection of exosomal miR-21. In the presence of miR-21, DNA walkers are activated to walk continuously along DNA tracks, resulting in conformational changes as well as considerable increases of the signal ratio produced by target-respond and target-independent reporters. With the signal cascade amplification of DNA walkers, the biosensor exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity with the limit of detection (LOD) down to 67 aM. Furthermore, owing to the background correcting function of target-independent reporters termed as reference reporters, the biosensor is robust and stable enough to be applied in the detection of exosomal miR-21 extracted from breast cancer cell lines and serums. In addition, because locked nucleic acid (LNA) modified toehold mediate strand displacement reaction (TMSDR) has extraordinary discriminative ability, the biosensor displays excellent selectivity even against the single-base-mismatched target. It is worth mentioning that our sensor is regenerative and stable for at least 5 cycles without diminution in sensitivity. In brief, the high sensitivity, selectivity and reproducibility, together with cheap, make the proposed biosensor a promising approach for exosomal miRNAs detection, in conjunction with early point-of-care testing (POCT) of cancer.

AB Herein, novel and versatile electrochemical aptasensors were constructed on a self-supported nanoporous gold (np-Au) microelectrode, integrating with an exonuclease III (Exo III) induced signal amplification strategy. Self supported np-Au microelectrode with 3D bicontinuous nanoporous structures possesses tremendously large specific area, clean surface, high stability and biocompatibility, bringing about significant advantages in both molecular recognition and signal response. As paradigms, two analytes of bisphenol A (BPA) and ochratoxin A (OTA) were selected to demonstrate the superiority and versatility of designed aptasensors. Trace amounts of mDNA (associated with BPA or OTA concentration) hybridized with cDNA strands assembled on np-Au microelectrode, activating the cleavage reaction with Exo III. Thus, cDNA was digested and mDNA was released to undergo a new hybridization and cleavage cycle. Finally, residual cDNA strands were recognized by methylene blue labelled rDNA/AuNPs with the assistance of hDNA to generate the electrochemical signals, which were used to quantitatively monitor targets. Under the optimized conditions, prepared aptasensors exhibited wide linear ranges (25 pg/mL to 2 ng/mL for BPA, 10 pg/mL to 5 ng/mL for OTA) with ultralow detection limits (10 pg/mL for BPA, 5 pg/mL for OTA), excellent selectivity and stability, and reliable detection in real samples. This work opens a new horizon for constructing promising electrochemical aptasensors for environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics and food safety.

AB Access to safe drinking water is a human right, crucial to combat inequalities, reduce poverty and allow sustainable development. In many areas of the world, however, this right is not guaranteed, in part because of the lack of easily deployable diagnostic tools. Low-cost and simple methods to test water supplies onsite can protect vulnerable communities from the impact of contaminants in drinking water. Ideally such devices would also be easy to dispose of so as to leave no trace, or have a detrimental effect on the environment. To this aim, we here report the first paper microbial fuel cell (pMFC) fabricated by screen-printing biodegradable carbon-based electrodes onto a single sheet of paper, and demonstrate its use as a shock sensor for bioactive compounds (e.g. formaldehyde) in water. We also show a simple route to enhance the sensor performance by folding back-to-back two pMFCs electrically connected in parallel. This promising proof of concept work can lead to a revolutionizing way of testing water at point of use, which is not only green, easy-to-operate and rapid, but is also affordable to all.

AB Accurate, fast and sensitive detection of disease-specific protein biomarkers, especially in blood, urine, or other bodily fluids, is an important approach to achieve early disease diagnosis. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), a widely used biomarker, is involved in a substantial number of serious diseases, such as hepatic fibrosis, atherosclerosis, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic eye disease and is often over-expressed in human malignant tumors. Therefore, the development of sensitive and specific detection methods for PDGF-BB is of great importance for the early diagnosis of disease and assessments of patient recovery. In the current study, a biolayer interferometry-based enzyme-linked aptamer sorbent assay (BLI-ELASA) was successfully established for rapid (20-25 min), high-throughput (8 or 16 samples) and real-time monitoring of PDGF-BB in clinical samples. The method exhibited a broad detection range from 0.5 to 1000 ng/mL of PDGF-BB (good linear range from 0.5 to 10 ng/mL), with a low detection limit of 0.08 ng/mL. Moreover, BLI-ELASA was applied to the detection of PDGF-BB in spiked serum and urine samples and showed a high degree of selectivity for PDGF-BB, good reproducibility, and stability. We believe that the methodology in this work can be easily adapted to detect other biomolecules in clinical samples, including viruses, pathogens and toxins, in a rapid, sensitive, high throughput and real-time manner.

AB Detection of a very low amount of cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) in clinical fluids is important in biomedical research and clinical applications. Here, we demonstrate spatially-localized ultrasensitive (femtogram mL(-1)) level detection of IL-6 in serum and in cell culture media. Our approach is based on a sandwich immuno-sensor fabricated on the surface of an optical fibre. Firstly, the biotinylated IL-6 capture antibody was immobilized on the fibre surface by biotin-streptavidin coupling. Then the fabricated fibre was used for capturing IL-6 followed by exposure to detection antibody which was labeled with the fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles to report the signal. A linear relationship between IL-6 concentration and the fluorescence signal was obtained in the range from 0.4 pg mL(-1) to 400 pg mL(-1) of IL-6, with the limit of detection down to 0.1 pg mL(-1). In addition, this optical fibre sensor was successfully applied for the localized detection of IL-6 with the spatial resolution of 200 pm and a sample volume of 1 mu L. Finally, the performance of the fibre sensor was demonstrated by detection of IL-6 secreted by BV-2 cells with comparable performance of the conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

AB The disposition dose of clopidogrel is different in CYP2C19*2 gene carriers and non-carriers. High-dose clopidogrel has been recommended to overcome a low-responsiveness to clopidogrel in patients with the CYP2C19*2 gene. To guide the choice of clopidogrel dosage and catalyse a development in the field of personalized therapy, we developed an ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensor to detect CYP2C19*2 gene. We constructed a novel assay based on cerium dioxide (CeO2)-functionalized carboxyl fullerene (c-C-60) supported by Pt nanoparticles (c-C-60/CeO2/PtNPs) for signal amplification. Au nanoparticles @ Fe-MIL-88NH(2) (AuNPs@Fe-MOFs) were synthesized by one-step method as the support platform to enhance the conductivity and immobilize more biotin modified capture probe (bio-CP) through the superior affinity and specificity between streptavidin and biotin. C-60/CeO2/PtNPs were labeled with signal probe to form the signal label. After the sandwich reaction of CYP2C19*2 gene between capture probe and the signal label, a distinguishing electrochemical signal from the catalysis of H2O2 by signal label would be observed. Amperometry was applied to record electrochemical signals. Under optimized conditions, the approach showed a good linear dependence between current and the logarithm of CYP2C19*2 gene concentrations in the range of 1 fM to 50 nM with a low detection limit of 0.33 fM (S/N = 3). The proposed method showed good specificity to target DNA compared with possible interfering substances. More importantly, the fabricated biosensor achieved accurate quantitative detection of CYP2C19*2 gene in human serum samples demonstrated by excellent correlations with standard DNA sequencing and provided a promising strategy for electrochemical biosensor detection of other gene mutations.

AB Exploration of noble-metal free catalysts with high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and durability as alternatives for platinum/carbon (Pt/C) in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) remains a great challenge. This study reports the preparation of nitrogen-doped cobalt/cobalt phosphide/carbon (Co/Co2P/NC) catalysts via an in situ simultaneous doping/reduction method by using residual cornstalks as carbon source. Effects of carbonization temperature on structural characteristics and catalytic activity of Co/Co2P/NC catalysts are investigated. Co/Co2P/NC-850 with regular network structure obtains the maximum power density of 972 5 mW m(-2), which is higher than that of Pt/C (808 5 mW m(-2)). The highest Coulombic efficiency (23.1%) and the lowest charge transfer resistance (0.93 Omega) are also obtained by Co/Co2P/NC (850 degrees C). ORR catalyzed by Co/Co2P/NC-850 is mainly via 4e(-) reduction pathway. The better durability of Co/Co2P/NC (850 degrees C) is detected from long-term operation of MFCs. The promising catalytic activity for ORR is attributed to the introduction of Co/Co2P nanoparticles/Schottky junctions and N species in porous carbon skeleton, which are served as active sites to trap and consume electrons. Biomass-derived carbon with good electrical conductivity can provide large specific surface area and abundant interconnected holes, which contribute to efficient permeation and transport of O-2. The synergistic effects between porous structure and sufficient active sites can energetically boost catalytic activity to improve ORR efficiency. These Co/Co2P/NC catalysts with durable power outputs are expected to have more extensive applications in MFCs.

AB We report the development of a simple and powerful capacitive aptasensor for the detection and estimation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a biomarker for breast cancer, in undiluted serum. The study involves the incorporation of interdigitated gold electrodes, which were used to prepare the electrochemical platform. A thiol terminated DNA aptamer with affinity for HER2 was used to prepare the bio-recognition layer via self-assembly on interdigitated gold surfaces. Non-specific binding was prevented by blocking free spaces on surface via starting block phosphate buffer saline-tween20 blocker. The sensor was characterized using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), atomic force microscopy and contact angle studies. Non-Faradic EIS measurements were utilized to investigate the sensor performance via monitoring of the changes in capacitance. The aptasensor exhibited logarithmically detection of HER2 from 1 pM to 100 nM in both buffer and undiluted serum with limits of detection lower than 1 pM. The results pave the way to develop other aptamer-based biosensors for protein biomarkers detection in undiluted serum.

AB We introduce for the first time a paper-based analytical device (PAD) for the non-enzymatic detection of glucose by modifying a screen-printed carbon electrode with cobalt phthalocyanine, graphene and an ionic liquid (CoPc/G/IL/SPCE). The modifying composite was characterized by UV visible spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The disposable devices show excellent conductivity and fast electron transfer kinetics. The results demonstrated that the modified electrode on PADs had excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of glucose with NaOH as supporting electrolyte (0.1 M). The oxidation potential of glucose was negatively shifted to 0.64 V vs. the screen-printed carbon pseudo-reference electrode. The paper-based sensor comprised a wide linear concentration range for glucose, from 0.01 to 1.3 mM and 1.3-5.0 mM for low and high concentration of glucose assay, respectively, with a detection limit of 0.67 mu M (S/N = 3). Additionally, the PADs were applied to quantify glucose in honey, white wine and human serum. The disposable, efficient, sensitive and low-cost non-enzymatic PAD has great potential for the development of point-of-care testing (POCT) devices that can be applied in healthcare monitoring.

AB Bead-based multiplex immunoassays for common use require enhanced sensitivity and effective prevention of non-specific adsorption, as well as miniaturization of the detection device. In this work, we have implemented virus-tethered gold microspheres for multiplex immunoassay applications, employing a DC impedance-based flow cytometer as a detection element. The advantages of virus-tethered gold microspheres, including excellent prevention of non-specific adsorption, are extended to signal enhancement arising from the large quantity of antibody loading on each virion, and to flexible movement of filamentous virus. Individual virus-tethered beads generate their own DC impedance and fluorescence signals, which are simultaneously detected by a chip-based microfluidic flow cytometer. This system successfully realized multiplex immunoassays involving four biomarkers: cardiac troponin I (cTnI), prostate specific antigen (PSA), creative kinase MB (CK-MB), and myoglobin in undiluted human sera, elevating sensitivity by up to 5.7-fold compared to the beads without virus. Constructive integration between filamentous virus-tethered Au-layered microspheres and use of a microfluidic cytometer suggests a promising strategy for competitive multiplex immunoassay development based on suspension arrays.

AB In this study, a photoresist template with well-defined contact hole array was fabricated, to which radio frequency magnetron sputtering process was then applied to deposit an alloyed Zr55Cu30Al10Ni5 target, and finally resulted in ordered metallic glass nanotube (MGNT) arrays after removal of the photoresist template. The thickness of the MGNT walls increased from 98 to 126 nm upon increasing the deposition time from 225 to 675 s. The wall thickness of the MGNT arrays also increased while the dimensions of MGNT reduced under the same deposition condition. The MGNT could be filled with biomacromolecules to change the effective refractive index. The air fraction of the medium layer were evaluated through static water contact angle measurements and, thereby, the effective refractive indices the transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) polarized modes were calculated. A standard biotin-streptavidin affinity model was tested using the MGNT arrays and the fundamental response of the system was investigated. Results show that filling the MGNT with streptavidin altered the effective refractive index of the layer, the angle of reflectance and color changes identified by an L*a*b* color space and color circle on an a*b* chromaticity diagram. The limit of detection (LOD) of the MGNT arrays for detection of streptavidin was estimated as 25 nM, with a detection time of 10 min. Thus, the MGNT arrays may be used as a versatile platform for high-sensitive label-free optical biosensing.

AB The olfactory system is a natural biosensor since its peripheral olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) respond to the external stimuli and transmit the signals to the olfactory bulb (OB) where they are integrated and processed. The axonal connections from the OSNs expressing about 1000 different types of odorant receptors are precisely organized and sorted out onto 1800 glomeruli in the OB, from which the olfactory information is delivered to and perceived by the central nervous system. This process is carried out with particularly high sensitivity, specificity and rapidity, which can be used for explosive detection. Biomimetic olfactory biosensors use various biological components from the olfactory system as sensing elements, possessing great commercial prospects. In this study, we utilized the genetically labeled murine M72 olfactory sensory neurons with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as sensing components and obtained long-term in vivo electro-physiological recordings from the M72 OSNs by implanting the microelectrode arrays (MEAs) into the behaving mouse's OB. The electro-physiological responses showed high reliability, reproducibility and specificity for odor detection, and particularly, the high sensitivity for the detection of odorants that contain benzene rings. Furthermore, our results indicated that it can detect trinitrotoluene (TNT) in liquid at a concentration as low as 10(-5) M and can distinguish TNT from other chemicals with a similar structure. Thus our study demonstrated that the in vivo biomimetic olfactory system could provide novel approaches to enhancing the specificity and increasing working lifespan of olfactory biosensors capable of detecting explosives.

AB In this paper, we develop a low-cost size-based microfluidic chip using conventional polycarbonate membrane to isolate CTCs from blood, and propose a strategy to increase the capture efficiency before cell filtration by a size enlargement method utilizing modified microbeads specifically binding to CTCs. Up to 91% of target cells were isolated from whole blood samples using our microfluidic capture system at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Moreover, a WBC depletion process is introduced which greatly decreases the WBC retaining on the filter membrane. The tests of immunofluorescence analysis of cells captured on the membrane were performed, which demonstrates that the device could provide a dependable CTC identification and CTC count in whole blood samples. Finally, the device was further validated in the detection of CTCs from blood samples of cancer patients, and it indicates a promising capability to detect CTC response to treatment.

AB To prevent spread of infection and antibiotic resistance, fast and accurate diagnosis of bacterial infection and subsequent administration of antimicrobial agents are important. However, conventional methods for bacterial detection and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) require more than two days, leading to delays that have contributed to an increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Here, we report an aptamer-functionalized capacitance sensor array that can monitor bacterial growth and antibiotic susceptibility in real-time. While E. colt and S. aureus were cultured, the capacitance increased over time, and apparent bacterial growth curves were observed even when 10 CFU/mL bacteria was inoculated. Furthermore, because of the selectivity of aptamers, bacteria could be identified within 1 h using the capacitance sensor array functionalized with aptamers. In addition to bacterial growth, antibiotic susceptibility could be monitored in real-time. When bacteria were treated with antibiotics above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the capacitance decreased because the bacterial growth was inhibited. These results demonstrate that the aptamer-functionalized capacitance sensor array might be applied for rapid ASTs.

AB Quantification of superoxide anions (O-2(center dot-)) is significant in the monitoring of many serious diseases and the design of enzyme-mimic catalysts plays the main role in the development of non-enzymatic O-2(center dot-) sensors. Herein, we proposed a facile self-assembly process to synthesize manganese phosphate modified carbon networks using three kinds of widely-used carbon materials (MWCNTs, NGS and GO) as pillar connectors. Characterizations demonstrate that manganese phosphate is widely dispersed inside and on the surface of carbon networks without visible morphology. Meanwhile, all three kinds of synthesized catalysts were successfully immobilized on the screen-printed carbon electrodes to evaluate the electrochemical performance of fabricated sensors. The results indicate that sensors based on Mn-x(PO4)(y) modified MWCNTs exhibit high sensitivity with an extremely low detection limit of 0.127 mu M (S/N = 3) and a wide liner range of 0-1.817 mM (R-2 = 0.998). We further employed the recommended sensors in the real-time monitoring of HepG2 cells released O-2(center dot-) under the stimulating of Zymosan (20 mg/mL). Noticeably, the proposed sensors exhibit not only sensitive response but also stable current steps upon different addition of Zymosan. The calculated concentrations of cell-released O-2(center dot-) vary from 6.772 to 24.652 pM cell(-1) for the Zymosan amount used in this work. The established novel sensors display low background current and signal noises, thus holding unique advantages in the trace analysis of O-2(center dot-) in biological samples and in vivo environment.

AB Infectious diseases are a serious global problem, which not only take an enormous human toll but also incur tremendous economic losses. In combating infectious diseases, rapid and accurate diagnostic tests are required for pathogen identification at the point of care (POC). In this review, investigations of diagnostic strategies for infectious diseases that are based on aptamers, especially nucleic acid aptamers, oligonucleotides that have high affinities and specificities toward their targets, are described. Owing to their unique features including low cost of production, easy chemical modification, high chemical stability, reproducibility, and low levels of immunogenicity and toxicity, aptamers have been widely utilized as bio-recognition elements (bio-receptors) for the development of infection diagnostic systems. We discuss nucleic acid aptamer-based methods that have been developed for diagnosis of infections using a format that organizes discussion according to the target pathogenic analytes including toxins or proteins, whole cells and nucleic acids. Also included is, a summary of recent advances made in the sensitive detection of pathogenic bacteria utilizing the isothermal nucleic acid amplification method. Lastly, a nucleic add aptamer-based POC system is described and future directions of studies in this area are discussed.

AB A sensitive sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) was successfully developed based on the gold@palladium nanoparticles (Au@Pd NPs) loaded by molybdenum disulfide functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (Au@Pd/MoS2@MWCNTs). The resultant nanocomposites not only possessed high specific surface area and good biocompatibility, but also exhibited excellent electro-catalytical property. Au NPs functionalized porous graphene oxide (p-GO@Au) were used as sensing platforms and primary antibodies carriers, which can accelerate the electron transfer and improve the load capacity of primary antibodies (Ab(1)), improving the sensitivity of the immunosensor. Under optimal conditions, the designed immunosensor could detect target HBeAg concentration in the range from 0.1pg/mL to 500 pg/mL, with a low detection limit of 26 fg/mL (S/N = 3) for HBeAg. Additionally, the designed immunosensor showed excellent specificity, good reproducibility and acceptable stability. The satisfactory results in analysis of human serum samples indicated that it had potential application in clinical monitoring of tumor markers.

AB The present work reports the interaction of various vitamin B-6 cofactors with the red emitting glutathione stabilized copper nanoclusters (GSH-CuNCs). Addition of pyridoxamine (PM) resulted a new turn-on band at 410 nm due to the possible adsorption over the surface of GSH-CuNCs. The nano-assembly PM-GSH-CuNCs was applied for the selective detection of nitro-aromatic compounds. Upon addition of picric acid (PA), the fluorescence of PM-GSH-CuNCs was selectively quenched at 410 nm and similar to 625 nm among the other tested nitro aromatic compounds. With a linearity range from 9.9 mu M to 43 mu M, the concentration of PA can be detected down to 2.74 mu M. The high selectivity exhibited by the nano-assembly allows to detect PA in real samples like tap water, river water and matchstick. Advantageously, the nano-assembly PM-GSH-CuNCs was chemically adsorbed over the cellulosic strips and applied for the naked-eye detection of PA down to 1 mu M.

AB Tumor-derived exosomes (TEXs) are extracellular vesicles that are continuously released into the blood by tumor cells and carry specific surface markers of the original tumor cells. Substantial evidence has implicated TEXs as attractive diagnostic markers for cancer. However, the detection of TEXs in blood at an early tumor stage is challenging due to their very low concentration. Here, we established a method called PLA-RPA-TMA assay that allows TEXs to be detected with high sensitivity and specificity. Based on two proximity ligation assay (PLA) probes that recognize a biomarker on a TEX, we generated a unique surrogate DNA signal for the specific biomarker, which was synchronously amplified twice by recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) coupled with transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), and then the products of the RPA-TMA reaction were quantitatively detected using a gold nanoparticle-based colorimetric assay. We established proof-of-concept evidence for this approach using TEXs from nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells, with a detection limit of 102 particles/mL, and reported the measurement of plasma Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 (LPM1)-positive (LMP1(+), accuracy: 0.956) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive (EGFR(+), accuracy: 0.906) TEXs as potent early diagnostic biomarkers for NPC.

AB We propose a ratiometric electrochemical assay for detecting microRNA (miRNA) on the basis of dual-amplification mechanism by using distinguishable electrochemical signals from thionine (Thi) and ferrocene (Fc). The thiol-modified and ferrocene-labeled hairpin capture probes (CP) are first immobilized on an Au electrode via Au-S reaction. The target miRNA hybridizes with CP and unfolding the hairpin structure of CP to form miRNA-DNA duplexes. Then, kamchatka crab duplex specific nuclease (DSN) specifically cleaves the DNA in miRNA-DNA duplexes, leading to the release of miRNA and another cleaves cycle, meanwhile, numerous Fc leaves away from the electrode surface and leads to the signal-off of Fc. The residual fragment on electrode surface acts as a HCR primer to form dsDNA polymers through in situ HCR with the presence of the primer and two probes (HDNA and HDNA'), resulting in the capture of numerous DNA/Au NPs/Thi and the signal-on of Thi. The dual amplification mechanism significantly amplifies the decrease of Fc signal and the increase of Thi signal for ratiometric readout (I-Thi/I-Fc), thus providing a sensitive method for the selective detection of miR-141 with a detection limit down to 11 aM. The dual-signal ratiometric outputs have an intrinsic self-calibration to the effects from system, which is promising to be applied in biosensing and clinical diagnosis.

AB A label-free electrochemical miRNA biosensor was developed based on a pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (acpcPNA)/polypyrrole (PPy)/silver nanofoam (AgNF) modified electrode. The AgNF was electrodeposited as redox indicator on a gold electrode, which was then functionalized with an electropolymerized layer of PPy, a conducting polymer, to immobilize the PNA probes. The fabrication process was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The biosensor was used to detect miRNA-21, a biomarker abnormally expressed in most cancers. The signal was monitored by the change in current of the AgNF redox reaction before and after hybridization using cyclic voltammetry. Two PNA probe lengths were investigated and the longer probe exhibited a better performance. Nucleotide overhangs on the electrode side affected the signal more than overhangs on the solution side due to the greater insulation of the sensing surface. Under optimal conditions, the electrochemical signal was proportional to miRNA-21 concentrations between 0.20 fM and 1.0 nM, with a very low detection limit of 0.20 fM. The biosensor showed a high specificity which could discriminate between complementary, single-, doubled-base mismatched, and non-complementary targets. Three out of the seven tested plasma samples provided detectable concentrations (63 4, 111 4 and 164 7 fM). The sensor also showed good recoveries (81-119%). The results indicated the possibilities of this biosensor for analysis without RNA extraction and/or amplification, making the sensor potentially useful for both the prognosis and diagnosis of cancer in clinical application.

AB The increasing progress in using nano-biomaterials for medical purposes has opened new horizons toward researchers around the globe. To investigate the presence of these nanomaterials and the impacts they might have, a comparative enhanced-electrochemiluminescence immunosensing study has been designed. The effects of utilizing graphene oxide, silica, and gold nanoparticles in cancer diagnosis were evaluated during the quantification of two major cancer biomarkers (CEA and AFP) in different approaches. In other words, first and second approaches were designed to employ nanomaterials while third and fourth approaches were developed in absence of those. Accordingly, resulted LODs experienced dramatic amplification when nano-biomaterials were included in the immunosensor modification (for AFP: 1st and 3rd approaches: 1.36 fg/ml in comparison with 0.39 ng/ml, and for CEA: 2nd and 4th approaches: 1.90 fg/ml versus 0.46 ng/ml, respectively). Correspondingly, capability of nano-biomaterials for developing highly sensitive and more efficient immunosensors was validated through selectivity, stability, reproducibility, and feasibility examinations.

AB We demonstrate a facile and rapid methodology for preparation of Cu@Pd core-shell nanostructures on a cost-effective pencil graphite substrate. Galvanic replacement reaction was carried out for palladium modification on template electrodeposited copper nanostructures on pencil graphite substrate. The nanostructures are shown to be very stable with excellent electrocatalytic activities. Under optimised conditions, they could be used for histamine sensing at a very low oxidation potential of +0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The low oxidation potential enabled sensitive and selective analysis of histamine using chronoamperometry without any interference from oxygen evolution reactions. We have demonstrated that the sensor shows excellent selectivity towards histamine even in the presence of many of the common interfering biogenic amines. The sensor exhibited a sensitivity of 0.082 mu A/mu M/cm (2) with a limit of detection as low as 3.2 +/- 0.1 nM. The oxidation potential and limit of detection obtained using this sensor are much superior to the results reported so far in the literature. Practical feasibility of the developed sensor was manifested by histamine analysis in canned tuna fish samples, where the chronoamperometric estimation was also validated by conventional HPLC analysis.

AB We report results of the studies relating to fabrication of nanostructured metal oxide (NMO) based cancer biosensor. With the help of 2D electroactive reduced graphene oxide (RGO), we successfully inhibited the Brownian motion of NMO that led to reduced agglomeration of NMO. The nanostructured hafnium oxide (nHfO(2)) was used as a model NMO. The reduced agglomeration of nHfO(2) was achieved through controlled hydrothermal synthesis and investigated via nanoparticles tracking analysis (NTA). X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) techniques were used for phase identification as well as morphological analysis of the synthesized nanohybrid (nHfO(2)@RGO) material. The 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) was used for the functionalization of nHfO(2)@RGO and electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique was used for its deposition onto ITO coated glass electrode. Further, antibodies of cancer biomarker (anti-CYFRA-21-1) were immobilized via EDC-NHS chemistry and Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used for blocking of the non-specific binding sites. The electrochemical response studies of fabricated immunoelectrode (BSA/anti-CYFRA-21-1/APTES/nHfO(2)@RGO/ITO) revealed higher sensitivity (18.24 mu A mL ng(-1)), wide linear detection range (0 to 30 ng mL(-1)), with remarkable lower detection limit (0.16 ng mL(-1)). The obtained results showed good agreement with the concentration of CYFRA-21-1 obtained through enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in saliva samples of oral cancer patients.

AB In vitro diagnostics (IVD) are essential in healthcare systems for detection of diseases, conditions, or infections. Affordable and sensitive methods remain a challenge in the development of IVD. In this article, we give an overview of paper-based fluorogenic devices, an emerging cost-effective analytical method for IVD applications. The paper-based devices are inexpensive, sensitive, selective, user-friendly and equipment-free. Furthermore, the fluorescent detection on paper-based devices has recently attracted enormous attentions due to its high sensitivity and selectivity. We summarize and compare various fluorescent materials that are used in the paper-based fluorogenic devices, including fluorescent dyes, quantum dots, metal nanoclusters, upconversion nanoparticles, and carbon dots. We review a wide range of IVD applications of the paper-based fluorogenic devices, e.g., detection of nucleic acids, proteins, cells, and so on. It may open an avenue to improve the global healthcare systems in the developing countries at point of care settings and in emergency situations.

AB Herein, bimetallic core-shell Au@Pt nanocrystals (Au@Pt NCs) were prepared by a simple one-pot aqueous method using 2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid sodium salt (PCA-Na) as a new and green growth-directing agent. The obtained architectures displayed excellent catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORB.) compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst. A novel immunosensor was constructed via assembly prostate specific antibody on the surface of Au@Pt NCs. It was found that the ORR currents were significantly suppressed due to the specific antigen-antibody reaction. The ultra-sensitive determination of prostate specific antigen (PSA) was realized on account of the immunocomplex impeding the redox probe accessible to the electrode. The immunosensor exhibited good analytical performance for the assay of PSA with the wide linear range of 0.1 similar to 50 ng mL(-1) and low detection limit of 0.018 ng mL(-1) (S/N = 3), coupled with the improved stability, reproducibility and selectivity.

AB In this work, an amplified electrochemical ratiometric aptasensor for nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) assay based on target binding-triggered ratiometric signal readout and polymerase-assisted protein recycling amplification strategy is described. To demonstrate the effect of "signal-off" and "signal-on" change for the dual-signal electrochemical ratiometric readout, the thiol-hairpin DNA (SH-HD) hybridizes with methylene blue (MB)-modified protection DNA (MB-PD) to form capture probes, which is rationally introduced for the construction of the assay platform. On the interface, the probes can specifically bind to target NF-kappa B and expose a toehold region which subsequently hybridizes with the ferrocene (Fc)-modified DNA strand to take the Fc group to the electrode surface, accompanied by displacing MB-PD to release the MB group from the electrode surface, leading to the both "signal-on" of Fc (I-Fc) and "signal-off" of MB (I-MB). In order to improve the sensitivity of the electrochemical aptasensor, phi29-assisted target protein recycling amplification strategy was designed to achieve an amplified ratiometric signal. With the above advantages, the prepared aptasensor exhibits a wide linear range of 0.1 pg mL(-1) to 15 ng mL(-1) with a low detection limit of 0.03 pg mL(-1). This strategy provides a simple and ingenious approach to construct ratiometric electrochemical aptasensor and shows promising potential applications in multiple disease marker detection by changing the recognition probe.

AB The worldwide boost in glucose related diseases such as diabetics over the last decade leads to an overwhelming demand for development of advanced electrochemical glucose sensors with high sensitivity, fast response and excellent selectivity. Herein we report a novel freestanding microelectrode comprising well-aligned Cu(OH)(2) nanograss arrays and uniform nanoporous copper (NPC) substrate. Such a cost-effective hierarchical hybrid structure entails a unique combination of good conductivity of NPC and high electrocatalytic activity of Cu (OH)(2). As a result, the glucose sensor based on the hybrid nanostructure exhibits extraordinary performance towards the oxidation of glucose with a high sensitivity of similar to 2.09 mA cm(-2) mM(-1), wide linear range of 0.2-9 mM, low detection limit of 197 nM, fast response time of less than 1 s and excellent selectivity. The current work not only provides novel hybrid materials with great potential to be commercialized in blood glucose sensing, but also has important implications for designing enhanced nanostructured electrocatalysts for engineering applications in general.

AB The construction of reliable sensors for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) detection gains increasing interest because of its important roles in various enzymatic activities and biological processes. Based on a cascaded, significant signal amplification approach by the integration of the aptazymes and catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA), we have developed a sensitive electrochemical sensor for the detection of ATP. The target ATP leads to the conformational change of the aptazyme sequences and their association with the hairpin substrates to form active aptazymes, in which the hairpin substrates are cyclically cleaved by the metal ion cofactors in buffer to release the enzymatic sequences that can also bind the hairpin substrates to generate active DNAzymes. The catalytic cleavage of the hairpin substrates in the aptazymes/DNAzymes thus results in the generation of a large number of intermediate sequences. Subsequently, these intermediate sequences trigger catalytic capture of many methylene blue-tagged signal sequences on the electrode surface through CHA, producing significantly amplified current response for sensitive detection of ATP at 0.6 nM. Besides, the developed sensor can discriminate ATP from analogous interference molecules and be applied to human serum samples, making the sensor a useful addition to the arena for sensitive detection of small molecules.

AB A novel and sensitive sandwich immunosensor for amperometric determination of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was designed using Au nanoparticles-titanium dioxide-graphene (AuNPs-TiO2-graphene) nanocomposites. Dopamine-functionalized graphene was firstly prepared by it-stacking interaction, and TiO2 was then attached to the surface of dopamine-graphene by the specificity and high affinity of enediol ligands to Ti (IV). Afterwards, AuNPs-TiO2-graphene nanocomposites were synthesized with photo-reduction approach under ultraviolet irradiation. The morphology and conductivity of the as-prepared nanocomposites were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectra, X-ray powder diffraction, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Taking the advantage of large specific surface area and excellent biocompatibility, AuNPs could covalently link horseradish peroxidase labeled secondary antibody (HRP-Ab(2)) through the interaction between AuNPs and mercapto or primary amine groups of HRP-Ab(2) for sandwich-type immunosensor construction. Under optimum conditions, the modified electrode exhibited a linear current response to CEA concentration in a wide range of 0.005-200 ng mL(-1) (R-2 = 0.994) with low detection limit of 3.33 pg mL(-1) (S/N = 3).

AB Herein, a new type of multifunctional iron based metal-organic frameworks (PdNPs@Fe-MOFs) has been synthesized by assembly palladium nanoparticles on the surface of Fe-MIL-88NH(2) MOFs microcrystals, and first applied in electrochemical biosensor for ultrasensitive detection of microRNA-122 (miR-122, a biomarker of drug-induced liver injury). The nanohybrids have not only been utilized as ideal nanocarriers for immobilization of signal probes, but also used as redox probes and electrocatalysts. In this biosensor, two hairpin probes were designed as capture probes and signal probes, respectively. The nanohybrids conjugated with streptavidin and biotinylated signal probes were used as the tracer labels, target miR-122 was sandwiched between the tracer labels and thiol-terminated capture probes inserted in MCH monolayer on the gold nanoparticles-functionalized nitrogen-doped graphene sheets (AuNPs@N-G) modified electrode. Based on target-catalyzed hairpin assembly, target miR-122 could trigger the hybridization of capture probes and signal probes to further be released to initiate the next reaction process resulted in numerous tracer indicators anchored onto the sensing interfaces. Thus, the detection signal could be dramatically enhanced towards the electrocatalytic oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine in the presence of H2O2 owing to the intrinsic and intriguing peroxidase-like activity of the nanohybrids. With the assist of target-catalyzed hairpin assembly and PdNPs@Fe-MOFs mimetic co-reaction for signal amplification, a wide detection range from 0.01 fM to 10 pM was achieved with a low detection limit of 0.003 fM (S/N = 3). Furthermore, the proposed biosensor exhibited excellent specificity and recovery in spiked serum samples, and was successfully used for detecting miR-122 in real biological samples, which provided a rapid and efficient method for detecting drug-induced liver injury at an early stage.

AB Based on the target-induced catalytic hairpin assembly and bimetallic catalyst, the enzyme-free recycling amplification strategy for sensitive detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA) has been designed. The aptamer and its complementary DNA (C-apt) are modified on the magnetic particles. The aptamer-PSA binding event can release the C-apt that triggers the catalytic assembly between hairpin capture DNA and hairpin help DNA. Then the catalytic hairpin assembly leads to cyclic reuse the C-apt and the generation of many opened hairpin capture DNA, which can associate with the prepared Au/Pt-polymethylene blue (PMB) probes to yield electrochemical signal. Meanwhile, the Au/Pt-PMB probes exhibit excellent electrocatalytic ability for H2O2 to magnify the response current. The designed sensor possesses a wide dynamic range of 10 fg mL(-1) to 100 ng mL(-1) and ultra low detection limit of 2.3 fg mL(-1). The present method has good performance in real serum sample analysis. This strategy is promising to be extended to provide a highly sensitive platform for various target analytes.

AB alpha 2,3-sialylated glycans (alpha 2,3-sial-Gs) are one of the significant tumour biomarkers for the early diagnosis of cancer. In this work, a neoteric sandwich-type biosensor was developed for detecting alpha 2,3-sial-Gs using 4-mercaptophenylboronic acid (4-MPBA) to construct a novel molecular recognition system by the coordination of a boron atom of 4-MPBA to the amide group of Neu5Ac in the alpha 2,3-sial-Gs structure. Amino-functionalized fullerene coupled with palladium-platinum bimetallic alloy nanocrystals (n-C-60-PdPt) was synthesized to modify the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) because the n-C-60 nanomaterial affords a large surface area for the on-site reduction of bimetallic alloy nanoparticles and an excellent capacity for electron transfer. Abundant 4-MPBA were immobilized on the n-C-60-PdPt, since the 4-MPBA has the mercapto group can combine with PdPt alloy through strong adsorption. Maackia amurensis lectin (MAL) was covalently immobilized on Au-poly (methylene blue) (Au-PMB) acting as the signal amplification components, which was used to recognize the alpha 2, 3-sial-Gs specifically like a second antibody linked on Au-PMB. The differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) current response of the biosensor in 5 mL of PBS (0.1 M, pH = 7.4) was recorded, and the proposed sandwich-type biosensor showed a wide linear range of 10 fg mL(-1) -100 ng mL(-1) as well as, a low detection limit of 3 fg mL(-1) (S/N = 3). Furthermore, the proposed method exhibited good recovery and stability, indicating its potential for use in clinical studies.

AB In the present study, an ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) aptasensing assay for selective detection of Hg2+ was designed. In this electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET) approach, Fe3O4@SiO2/dendrimers/QDs exhibited amplified ECL emissions (switch "on" state) and with the hybridization between T-rich ssDNA(S-1) immobilized on the Fe3O4@SiO2/dendrimers/QDs and AuNP5 modified with complementary aptamer (AuNPs-S-2), the ECL of QDs nanocomposites was efficiently quenched (switch "off" state). In the presence of Hg2+ ions, formation of strong and stable T-Hg2+-T complex led to the release of the AuNPs-S-2 from double-stranded DNA(dsDNA) and the recovery of the ECL signal of QDs (second signal switch "on" state). Under optimal conditions, Hg2+ can be detected in a wide linear range from 20 aM to 2 mu M with a very low detection limit of 2 aM. The proposed ECL aptasensor showed high selectivity for Hg2+ determination compared to other environmentally relevant metal ions at concentration ratio more than 1000 times. The aptasensor was used for detection Hg2+ ions from samples of tap waters, carp and saltwater fishes with satisfactory results. The aptasensor exhibited high sensitivity, wide linear response (11 orders of magnitude), excellent reproducibility and stability. The proposed aptasensor will be a promising candidate for facile and rapid determination of Hg2+ in environmental and fishery samples.

AB This study is an investigation for an inexpensive, simple and sensitive biosensor to detect prostate cancer using bioactivated-multi wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs, diameter of 20 nm, length of 5 pm) and a micro-pore filter paper (pore size of 0.45 mu m). For the immunoassay of prostate specific antigen (PSA), which is a biomarker of prostate cancer, MWCNTs were activated with PSA antibody (monoclonal antibody of the prostate specific antigen) by using N-(3-dimethylaminopropy1)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide sodium salt (NHSS). The activated MWCNTs were deposited on the micro-pore filter paper to use as a biosensor. The prepared biosensor can assay from 0 to 500 ng/mL of PSA level within 2 h with the detection limit of 1.18 ng/mL by the measurement of resistance change. The resistance change was caused by site selective interaction between PSA and PSA-antigen with an inexpensive bench top digital multimeter (5 1/2 digits). The detection range and sensitivity of the prepared sensor are good enough to diagnose the early stage of prostate cancer ( > 4 ng/mL of PSA). This paper-based biosensor is about 20 times cheaper (fabricated biosensor price: 2.4 $) and over 10 times faster than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which is a general method for the detection of a specific protein in the modernized hospitals. Furthermore, the maximum detection limit is about 50 times higher than ELISA.

AB A novel bi-component composite of porous self-assembled micro-/nanostructured Ni0.1Mn0.9O1.45 micro ellipsoids as high-performance anode electrocatalyst for microbial fuel cells (MFCs) is successfully synthesized via a simple coprecipitation reaction in microemulsion and calcination method in air atmosphere. The morphology and structural characterization indicate that the as-fabricated Ni0.1Mn0.9O1.45 product is consist of Mn2O3 and NiMn2O4 (n(Mn2O3): n(NiMn2O4) = 0.35: 0.1) and has a porous microellipsoidal morphology. The microellipsoids are compose of numerous layered micro-/nanostructured blocks and the special porous micro ellipsoids structure of Ni0.1Mn0.9O1.45 offers a large specific surface area for bacteria adhesion. The porous Ni0.1Mn0.9O1.45 microellipsoids as anode electrocatalyst for MFCs exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity to promote the extracellular electron transfer (EET) between the anode and bacteria, hence improves the performance of MFC. The MFC equipped with Ni0.1Mn0.9O1.45/CF anode achieves a maximum power density of 1.39 +/- 0.02 W m(-2), is significantly higher than that of commercial carbon felt anode.

AB Bioelectronics platforms are gaining widespread attention as they provide a template to study the interactions between biological species and electronics. Decoding the effect of the electrical signals on the cells and tissues holds the promise for treating the malignant tissue growth, regenerating organs and engineering new-age medical devices. This work is a step forward in this direction, where bio- and electronic materials co-exist on one platform without any need for post processing. We fabricate a freestanding and flexible hydrogel based platform using 3D bioprinting. The fabrication process is simple, easy and provides a flexible route to print materials with preferred shapes, size and spatial orientation. Through the design of interdigitated electrodes and heating coil, the platform can be tailored to print various circuits for different functionalities. The biocompatibility of the printed platform is tested using C2C12 murine myoblasts cell line. Furthermore, normal human dermal fibroblasts (primary cells) are also seeded on the platform to ascertain the compatibility.

AB Circulating cancer stem cells (CCSCs), a rare circulating tumor cell (CTC) type, recently arose as a useful resource for monitoring and characterizing both cancers and their metastatic derivatives. However, due to the scarcity of CCSCs among hematologic cells in the blood and the complexity of the phenotype confirmation process, CCSC research can be extremely challenging. Hence, we report a nanoparticle-mediated Raman imaging method for CCSC characterization which profiles CCSCs based on their surface marker expression phenotypes. We have developed an integrated combinatorial Raman-Active Nanoprobe (RAN) system combined with a microfluidic chip to successfully process complete blood samples. CCSCs and CTCs were detected (90% efficiency) and classified in accordance with their respective surface marker expression via completely distinct Raman signals of RANs. Selectively isolated CCSCs (93% accuracy) were employed for both in vitro and in vivo tumor phenotyping to identify the tumorigenicity of the CCSCs. We utilized our new method to predict metastasis by screening blood samples from xenograft models, showing that upon CCSC detection, all subjects exhibited liver metastasis. Having highly efficient detection and noninvasive isolation capabilities, we have demonstrated that our RAN based Raman imaging method will be valuable for predicting cancer metastasis and relapse via CCSC detection. Moreover, the exclusion of peak overlapping in CCSC analysis with our Raman imaging method will allow to expand the RAN families for various cancer types, therefore, increasing therapeutic efficacy by providing detailed molecular features of tumor subtypes.

AB In this work, we propose an integrated self-powered sensing system, driven by a hybrid biofuel cell (HBFC) with carbon paper discs coated with multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The sensing system has a biocathode made from laccase or bilirubin oxidase, and the anode is made from a zinc plate. The system includes a dedicated custombuilt electronic control unit for the detection of oxygen and catechol analytes, which are central to medical and environmental applications. Both the HBFC and sensors, operate in a mediatorless direct electron transfer mode. The measured characteristics of the HBFC with externally applied resistance included the power-time dependencies under flow cell conditions, the sensors performance (evaluated by cyclic voltammetry), and chronoamperometry. The HBFC is integrated with analytical devices and operating in a pulse mode form long run monitoring experiments. The HBFC generated sufficient power for wireless data transmission to a local computer.

AB A novel electrochemical sensing platform based on combination of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and copper nickel hybrid nanoparticles (Cu@Ni/MWCNTs) was developed for simultaneous detection of guanine (G) and adenine (A). The Ni/MWCNTs and Cu@Ni/MWCNTs nanocomposites were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The electrochemical behaviors of G and A on the modified electrode were explored by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in phosphate buffer with pH 3.0. Under the optimal conditions, electrical signals were linear over the concentration ranges from 5.0 to 180 mu M and 8.0 to 150 mu M for simultaneous determination G and A with the detection limit as low as 0.35 mu M and 0.56 mu M (S/N = 3), respectively. Furthermore, linear concentration ranges in individual determination are 1.0-180 mu M and 2.0-150 mu M with detection limits of 0.17 mu M and 0.33 mu M (S/N = 3) for G and A, respectively. The sensor was successfully used to quantify G and A in real samples. The Cu@ Ni/MWCNTs composite presented here can serve as a promising candidate for developing electrochemical sensor devices and plays an important role in widespread fields.

AB A novel screen-printed cell-based electrochemical sensor was developed to assess bacterial quorum signaling molecules, N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs). Screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE), which possesses excellent properties such as low-cost, disposable and energy-efficient, was modified with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) to improve electrochemical signals and enhance the sensitivity. Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cells encapsulated in alginate/graphene oxide (NaAgl/GO) hydrogel were immobilized on the MWNTs/SPCE to serve as recognition element. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to record the cell impedance signal as-influenced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum-sensing molecule, N-3-oxododecanoyl homoserine lactone (30C(12)-HSL). Experimental results show that 30C(12)-HSL caused a significant decrease in cell viability in a dose dependent manner. The EIS value decreased with concentrations of 30C(12)-HSL in the range of 0.1-1 mu M, and the detection limit for 30C(12)-HSL was calculated to be 0.094 mu M. These results were confirmed via cell viability, SEM, TEM analysis. Next, the sensor was successfully applied to monitoring the production of AHLs by spoilage bacteria in three different freshwater fish juice samples which efficiently proved the practicability of this cell based method. Therefore, the proposed cell sensor may serve as an innovative and effective approach to the measurement of quorum signaling molecule and thus provides a new avenue for realtime monitoring the spoilage bacteria in freshwater fish production.

AB In this manuscript, a disposable paper-based analytical device comprised of a closed bipolar electrode (BPE) was fabricated for the ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection of intracellular H2O2 and the number of cancer cells. In this approach, wax printing was used to fabricated reaction zone, and carbon ink-based BPE and driving electrodes were screen-printed into the paper. AuPd nanoparticles (NPs), which served as a carrier of the capture aptamer and as the catalyst for the ECL reaction of luminol and H2O2, were used to modify the BPE. Luminol/Au NPs were attached to the surface of the captured cells via hybridation chain reaction with two hairpin structure DNA labelled luminol/Au NPs. In the stimulation of phorbol myristate acetate, The coreactant H2O2 was released from the target cells. The ECL response of the luminol-H2O2 system was related to the number of cancer cells in the testing buffer, which served as a quantitative signal for the determination of cancer cells and the concentration of H2O2. In order to decrease the external voltage, K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] was introduced in the cathode resevoir of BPE because it gained electrons at the cathode more easily than oxygen. The ECL intensity was quantitatively related to the concentration of MCF-7 in the range of 1.0 x 10(2)-1.0(7) cells/mL. The detection limit was 40 cells/mL and it showed good specificity for cells with high overexpression of mucin-1 receptor, it was concluded that the developed protocol could be effectively utilized for the detection of MCF-7 cells.

AB The high-quality spots in microchips are prerequisites for sensitive and accurate detection of biomarkers. In this work, the superwettable micropattern was constructed by introducing superhydrophilic microwells onto a superhydrophobic substrate. The sample can distribute homogeneously within the well-designed superhydrophilic microwells after droplet evaporation and form homogeneous deposit spots, which can be ascribed to the enhanced Marangoni effect in superwettable micropattern and the suppressed outward flow by 3D nanodendritic silica structure. Based on the improved homogeneity of spots, sensitive and accurate fluorescence readout could be obtained. The free prostate-specific antigen (f-PSA) microchip based on the superwettable micropattern was developed. This superwettable f-PSA microchip exhibits high sensitivity, excellent specificity and long-term stability, and a limit of detection as low as 10 fg ML-1 is achieved. Moreover, the superwettable f-PSA microchip can accurately detect human serum samples with excellent correlations with chemiluminescence immunoassay in the clinic, demonstrating its great potential as a sensitive and reliable sensing platform for biological analysis and clinical diagnosis.

AB Nanoparticle (NP)-carbon nanomaterial hybrid structures have garnered significant attention due to their synergistic effects. Based on their interesting properties, hybrid nanomaterial-based sensing platforms have been investigated to achieve high sensitivity and selectivity detection. In our study, binary-NP-decorated carbon nanotubes (bNP-CNTs) were successfully synthesized through a simple two-step method and applied as a bio-sensing platform. Gold (Au)/iron-oxide magnetic NP-decorated CNTs (Au/MNP-CNT) were used for influenza and norovirus DNA sensing channels. To demonstrate biosensing, first, the Au/MNP-CNTs were magnetically aligned on a Pt-interdigitated electrode, and then, a thiol-group-functionalized probe DNA was attached to the Au NP surface on the bNP-CNT hybrid structure through thiol chemistry. DNA hybridization between the target influenza or norovirus DNA and probe DNA was measured to monitor an electrical conductivity change of the Au/MNP-CNTs. Various concentrations of target DNA from 1 pM to 10 nM were monitored, and the limits of detection for influenza virus and norovirus were calculated to be approximately 8.4 pM and 8.8 pM, respectively. The specificity was confirmed using different mismatched DNA sequences, showing high specificity. Therefore, this Au/MNP-CNT-based DNA sensing system exhibited excellent detection potential, and such hybrid materials could be universally applied as a highly sensitive and selective biosensing system.

   RECENT TRENDS
AB Immunosensors are biosensors based on interactions between an antibody and antigen on a transducer surface. Either antibody or antigen can be the species immobilized on the transducer to detect antigen or antibody, respectively. Because of the strong binding forces between these biomolecules, immunosensors present high selectivity and very high sensitivity, making them very attractive for many applications in different science fields. Electrochemical immunosensors explore measurements of an electrical signal produced on an electro-chemical transductor. This signal can be voltammetric, potentiometric, conductometric or impedimetric. Immunosensors utilizing electrochemical detection have been explored in several analyses since they are specific, simple, portable, and generally disposable and can carry out in situ or automated detection. This review addresses the potential of immunosensors destined for application in food and environmental analysis, and cancer biomarker diagnosis. Emphasis is given to the approaches that have been used for construction of electrochemical immunosensors. Additionally, the fundamentals of immunosensors, technology of transducers and nanomaterials and a general overview of the possible applications of electrochemical immunosensors to the food, environmental and diseases analysis fields are described.

AB The detection of biomarkers using sensitive and selective analytical devices is critically important for the early stage diagnosis and treatment of diseases. The synergy between the high specificity of nucleic acid recognition units and the great sensitivity of electrochemical signal transductions has already shown promise for the development of efficient biosensing platforms. Yet nucleic-acid based electrochemical biosensors often rely on target amplification strategies (e.g., polymerase chain reactions) to detect analytes at clinically relevant concentration ranges. The complexity and time-consuming nature of these amplification methods impede moving nucleic acid-based electrochemical biosensors from laboratory-based to point-of-care test settings. Fortunately, advancements in nanotechnology have provided growing evidence that the recruitment of nanoscaled materials and structures can enhance the biosensing performance (particularly in terms of sensitivity and response time) to the level suitable for use in point-of-care diagnostic tools. This Review highlights the significant progress in the field of nucleic acid-based electrochemical nanobiosensing with the focus on the works published during the last five years.

AB Label-free biosensing methods that rely on the use of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) have attracted great attention as a result of their simplicity, high sensitivity, and relatively low cost. However, in-situ analysis of real samples using these techniques has remained challenging because colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) can be unstable at certain levels of pH and salt concentration. Even in the case of a chip-type LSPR sensor that can resolve the instability problem by employing NPs immobilized on the substrate, loading of a sample to sensor chip with exact volume control can be difficult for unskilled users. Herein, we report an optical-fiber-based LSPR aptasensor that can avoid these problems and serve as a portable and simple system for sensitive detection of a small mycotoxin,, ochratoxin A (OTA), in real samples. The optical fiber coated with aptamer-modified gold nanorods (GNRs) is simply dipped into a solution containing OTA and subjected to LSPR analysis. Quantitative analysis of OTA is performed by measuring the spectral red shift of the LSPR peak of GNRs. Under optimized conditions, the LSPR peak shift displays a linear response (R-2 = 0.9887) to OTA in the concentration range from 10 pM to 100 nM, with a limit of detection of 12.0 pM (3 S). The developed sensor shows a high selectivity for OTA over other mycotoxins such as zearalenone (ZEN) and ochratoxin B (OTB), and shows an accurate detection capability for OTA in real grape juice samples.

AB In this paper, we report a simple one-step synthesis of well-dispersed amorphous cobalt hydroxide/oxide-modified graphene oxide (CoOxH-GO) possessing peroxidase-like catalytic activity, and its application for the detection of H2O2, glucose, and CN- ions. CoOxH is formed and deposited in situ on the GO surface through the reaction between GO (size similar to 240 nm) and Co2+ in basic solution at room temperature. We investigated the enzyme-mimicking activity of the CoOxH-GO nanohybrid in detail via the H2O2-mediated oxidation of Amplex Red (AR) to form fluorescent resorufin. The peroxidase-like activity of CoOxH-GO is utilized herein for the quantitation of H2O2 in a wide concentration range, from 100 nM to 100 mu M. When coupled with glucose oxidase (GOD), the AR/CoOxH-GO system can determine glucose level in blood samples. Interestingly, cyanide ions (CN-) significantly inhibit the catalytic activity of the CoOxH-GO nanohybrid, which allows for the construction of a probe for the detection of CN- in water samples and laboratory wastes. We fabricated a membrane-based CoOxH-GO probe for the visual detection of CN- by preparing a thin film of CoOxH-GO on a positively charged and porous nylon membrane (N+M). The CoOxH-GO/N+M operates on the principle that CN- inhibits the catalytic activity of CoOxH-GO towards the H2O2-mediated oxidation of AR to form reddish resorufin on the membrane. The intensity of the red color of the membrane decreases with increasing CN- concentration, which can be easily observed with the naked eye at the nanomolar level. This cost-effective sensing system allows for the rapid and simple determination of the concentrations of CN- in complicated wastewater samples.

AB The identification of tumor markers is of great importance for clinical diagnosis but accurate detection with high sensitivity is still a great challenge. In present work, a spatial-resolved dual-signal-output electrochemiluminescent (ECL) ratiometric assay platform was constructed for sensitive detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA) on a dual-disk glassy carbon electrode. To fabricate the platform, flower-like CdS three-dimensional (3D) assemblies and Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) -conjugated silica nanoparticles (Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) @RuSi NPs), were immobilized onto the two disks as cathodic and anodic ECL emitters, respectively. After the stepwise modification of the gold nanoparticles, antibody for PSA, and bovine serum albumin onto the two disks respectively, the Ru (bpy)(3)(2+) @RuSi NPs-based disk were incubated with varied concentration of PSA as working electrode, whereas the flower-like CdS 3D assemblies-based disk with fixed concentration of PSA were taken as internal reference electrode. The label free assay of PSA was realized by the ratio of anodic ECL signal from working electrode to the cathodic ECL signal from the internal reference electrode (ECLanode/ECLcathode). On the basis of the spatial resolved dual-signal-output ratiometric ECL sensor, the PSA can be detected accurately with a linear range of 0.001 - 50 ng/mL at a concentration as low as 0.34 pg/mL. Furthermore, the proposed method was applied for PSA determination in human serum samples with satisfying results. Thanks to the same modified process of the two disks, this universal design well avoids environmental errors including the interference caused in the biological recognition process, which effectively reduces the false positive or negative errors, exhibiting a greatly improved accuracy, reliability and sensitivity.

AB Magnetic solid phase substrates for biomolecule manipulation have become a valuable tool for simplification and automation of molecular biology protocols. However, the handling of magnetic particles inside microfluidic chips for miniaturized assays is often challenging due to inefficient mixing, aggregation, and the advanced instrumentation required for effective actuation. Here, we describe the use of a microfluidic magnetic fluidized bed approach that enables dynamic, highly efficient and simplified magnetic bead actuation for DNA analysis in a continuous flow platform with minimal technical requirements. We evaluate the performance of this approach by testing the efficiency of individual steps of a DNA assay based on padlock probes and rolling circle amplification. This assay comprises common nucleic acid analysis principles, such as hybridization, ligation, amplification and restriction digestion. We obtained efficiencies of up to 90% for these reactions with high throughput processing up to 120 mu L of DNA dilution at flow rates ranging from 1 to 5 mu L/min without compromising performance. The fluidized bed was 20-50% more efficient than a commercially available solution for microfluidic manipulation of magnetic beads. Moreover, to demonstrate the potential of this approach for integration into micro-total analysis systems, we optimized the production of a low-cost polymer based microarray and tested its analytical performance for integrated single-molecule digital read-out. Finally, we provide the proof-of-concept for a single-chamber microfluidic chip that combines the fluidized bed with the polymer microarray for a highly simplified and integrated magnetic bead-based DNA analyzer, with potential applications in diagnostics.

AB Neurotransmitters are important biochemical molecules that control behavioral and physiological functions in central and peripheral nervous system. Therefore, the analysis of neurotransmitters in biological samples has a great clinical and pharmaceutical importance. To date, various methods have been developed for their assay. Of the various methods, the electrochemical sensors demonstrated the potential of being robust, selective, sensitive, and real time measurements. Recently, conducting polymers (CPs) and their composites have been widely employed in the fabrication of various electrochemical sensors for the determination of neurotransmitters. Hence, this review presents a brief introduction to the electrochemical biosensors, with the detailed discussion on recent trends in the development and applications of electrochemical neurotransmitter sensors based on CPs and their composites. The review covers the sensing principle of prime neurotransmitters, including glutamate, aspartate, tyrosine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, histamine, choline, acetylcholine, nitrogen monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide. In addition, the combination with other analytical techniques was also highlighted. Detection challenges and future prospective of the neurotransmitter sensors were discussed for the development of biomedical and healthcare applications.

AB A novel single-cell analysis platform (SCA) was developed for the investigation of platelets adhesion to single human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) via using the adhesion molecule (E-selectin) on the damaged HUVEC as the marker site, and integrating electrochemiluminescence (ECL) with the ultrasensitive Au@DL-ZnCQDs nanoprobes. The Au@DL-ZnCQDs nanocomposite, a kind of double layer zinc-coadsorbed carbon quantum dot (ZnCQDs) core-shell nanoprobe, was firstly constructed by using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as the core to load with ZnCQDs and then the citrate-modified silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as the bridge to link AuNPs-ZnCQDs with ZnCQDs to form the core-shell with double layer ZnCQDs (DL-ZnCQDs) nanoprobe, revealed a 10 fold signal amplification. The H2O2-induced oxidative damage HUVECs were utilized as the cellular model on which anti-E-selectin functionalized nanoprobes specially recognized E-selectin, the SCA showed that the ECL signals decreased with platelets adhesion to single HUVEC. The proposed SCA could effectively and dynamically monitor the adhesion between single HUVEC and platelets in the absence and presence of collagen activation, moreover, be able to quantitatively detect the number of platelets adhesion to single HUVEC, and show a good analytical performance with linear range from 1 to 15 platelets. In contrast, the HUVEC was down-regulated the expression of adhesion molecules by treating with quercetin inhibitor, and the SCA also exhibited the feasibility for analysis of platelets adhesion to single HUVEC. Therefore, the single-cell analysis platform provided a novel and promising protocol for analysis of the single intercellular adhesion, and it will be beneficial to elucidate the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases.

AB Cholesterol is an essential ingredient in mammals, and serum cholesterol is a major component of atherosclerotic plaques. The level of cholesterol in human serum has become an important index for clinical diagnosis and prevention of cardiovascular disease. In this paper, a simple and ultrasensitive cholesterol biosensor based on graphene oxide (GO) and gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) co-mediated enzymatic silver deposition was designed by immobilizing cholesterol oxidase (CHOD), cholesterol esterase (CHER) and GO onto the surface of Au NPs modified screen-printed carbon electrode (SPE). Under the synergistic effect of CHER, CHOD and GO, the cholesterol was hydrolyzed to generate hydrogen peroxide, which can reduce the silver (Ag) ions in the solution to metallic Ag which deposited on the surface of Au NPs modified SPE. The ultrasensitive detection of cholesterol was achieved by anodic stripping voltammetry measurement of the enzymatically deposited Ag. Under optimal conditions, the anodic stripping peak current of Ag increased with the increasing cholesterol concentration in the range from 0.01 mu g/mL to 5000 mu g/mL with a limit of detection of 0.001 mu g/mL (S/N = 3). In addition, the ultrasensitive cholesterol biosensor exhibited higher specificity, acceptable reproducibility and excellent recoveries for cholesterol detection.

AB Rare cancer cells in body fluid could be useful biomarkers for noninvasive diagnosis of cancer. However, detection of these rare cells is currently challenging. In this work, a binding-induced dual catalytic hairpin assembly (DCHA) electrochemical cytosensor was developed for highly selective and sensitive detection of cancer cells. The fuel probe, released by hybridization between the capture probe and catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) products of target cell-responsive reaction, initiated dual CHA recycling, leading to multiple CHA products. Furthermore, the hybridization between fuel probe and capture probe decreased non-specific CHA products, improving the signal-to-noise ratio and detection sensitivity. Under the optimal conditions, the developed cytosensor was able to detect cells down to 30 cells mL(-1) (S/N = 3) with a linear range from 50 to 100,000 cells mL(-1) and was capable of distinguishing target cells from normal cells in clinical blood samples.

AB Exosomes, as potential cancer diagnostic markers have received close attention in recent years. However, there is still a lack of simple and convenient methods to detect and quantitate exosomes. Herein, we used a simple paper supported aptasensor based on luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) from upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) to gold nanorods (Au NRs) for the accessible determination of exosomes. When exosomes are present, the two sections of the aptamer can combine with the CD63 protein on the surface of exosomes and form a conjugation to close the distance between UCNPs and Au NRs, which initiates the LRET and promotes luminescence quenching. These variations can be monitored by the homemade image system, and the green channel intensities of obtained colored images were extracted with photoshop software to quantify the luminescence. As a result, the quenching of the luminescence of the UCNPs is linearly correlated to the concentration of the exosomes (in the range of 1.0 x 10(4) similar to 1.0 x 10(8) particles/mu L), enabling the detection and quantification of the exosomes. Such approach can reach a low detection limit of exosomes (1.1 x 10(3) particles/mu L) and effectively reduce the background signal by using UCNPs as a luminescent material. This study provides an efficient and practical approach to the detection of exosomes, which should lead to point-of-care testing in clinical applications.

AB We engineered an automated biomechatronics system, MyoRobot, for robust objective and versatile assessment of muscle or polymer materials (bio-)mechanics. It covers multiple levels of muscle biosensor assessment, e.g. membrane voltage or contractile apparatus Ca2+ ion responses (force resolution 1 mu N, 0-10 mN for the given sensor; [Ca2+] range similar to 100 nM-25 mu M). It replaces previously tedious manual protocols to obtain exhaustive information on active/passive biomechanical properties across various morphological tissue levels. Deciphering mechanisms of muscle weakness requires sophisticated force protocols, dissecting contributions from altered Ca2+ homeostasis, electro-chemical, chemico-mechanical biosensors or visco-elastic components. From whole organ to single fibre levels, experimental demands and hardware requirements increase, limiting biomechanics research potential, as reflected by only few commercial biomechatronics systems that can address resolution, experimental versatility and mostly, automation of force recordings. Our MyoRobot combines optical force transducer technology with high precision 3D actuation (e.g. voice coil, 1 mu m encoder resolution; stepper motors, 4 gm feed motion), and customized control software, enabling modular experimentation packages and automated data pre-analysis. In small bundles and single muscle fibres, we demonstrate automated recordings of (i) caffeine-induced-, (ii) electrical field stimulation (EFS)-induced force, (iii) pCa-force, (iv) slack-tests and (v) passive length-tension curves. The system easily reproduces results from manual systems (two times larger stiffness in slow over fast muscle) and provides novel insights into unloaded shortening velocities (declining with increasing slack lengths). The MyoRobot enables automated complex biomechanics assessment in muscle research. Applications also extend to material sciences, exemplarily shown here for spider silk and collagen biopolymers.

AB In this study, a single-domain antibody against negative regulatory factor (anti-NEF scFv) was autodisplayed on the outer membrane of Escherichia colt and used to detect NEF in an immunoassay based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and surface plasmon resonance biosensors. Next, the autodisplayed single-domain antibody was oxidized to form disulfide bonds by using glutathione, and the change in NEF-binding activity of anti-NEF scFv was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based immunoassay, chromogenic immunoassay, and surface plasmon resonance biosensor. For each type,of immunoassays the anti-NEF scFv on the isolated outer membrane showed more NEF binding activity after the disulfide bond formation by glutathione. To determine the role of cysteines in anti-NEF scFv, three mutants were prepared, and the NEF binding activity of mutants was compared with that of wild-type anti-NEF scFv in a competitive immunoassay based on FACS. In these mutant studies, the refolding process of autodisplayed anti-NEF scFv by following oxidation via GSH/GSSG revealed that disulfide bonds formed and increased NEF binding activity.

AB In this work, a sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) detection has been constructed and tested. Unlike many other sensors using external electrochemical species in the electrolyte to generate an electrochemical signal, a ferrocene derivative has been integrated into the design of the sensor to provide an internal reporting system, allowing detection of CEA in buffers and biological samples. Gold nano particles, which have been used to increase the conductivity of sensing surfaces, also carry immobilized secondary anti-CEA and a ferrocene derivative. The shelf life testing of the sensor shows good performance after storage for 4 weeks. The sensor has been calibrated against different concentration of the target protein using square wave voltammetry. The calibration curve has been obtained in the range of 0.05-20 ng mL(-1), and the detection limit for CEA is similar to 0.01 ng mL(-1). The capability of the immunosensor has been verified by performing detection of CEA in human serum samples.

AB We developed an electrochemical enzymatic biosensor coated with red blood cell membrane (RBCM) for highly selective glucose measurement. The RBCM containing its membrane proteins (glucose transporter-1) was extracted from a human red blood cell (RBC), and then placed on an established enzymatic glucose sensor by the vesicle fission method. In the newly fabricated glucose sensor, the RBCM plays the role in the diffusion barrier of preventing the penetration of interfering molecules, while in contrast making glucose molecules permeable. We employed scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy to analyze the RBCM diffusion barriers. The performance of our glucose sensors with diffusion barriers was tested regarding selectivity to glucose against other interfering molecules, such as ascorbic acid, uric acid, and galactose. Remarkably, employing the RBCM significantly improved the selectivity and accuracy of the glucose measurement, even under human serum, compared to the uncoated sensors. This result implies that the RBCM serves well as a highly permselective layer to glucose molecules, and a diffusion barrier to other molecules.

AB In this work, we developed a visual ECL ratiometry on a closed bipolar electrode (BPE) for the detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA), prostate cancer biomarker. High efficient CdTe QDs was synthesized which emitted visualized red light at BPE cathode. Integrating with the anodic ECL emitters, luminol, visual emission of red-blue ratiometric ECL was achieved in BPE array chips. As a sensing probe, Au NRs nanocomposite was assembled on the surface of the cathode and acted as both the quencher of the CdTe QDs ECL and the promoter of the luminol ECL. After incubated with PSA, the Au NRs nanocomposite was peeled off from the electrode surface due to the specific recognition between PSA and aptamer. Consequently, the cathode ECL partly recovered and the anode ECL turned off. By measuring the ratio of visual ECL intensity at two poles of BPE, sensitive detection of PSA was achieved with a linear range from 1.0 ng/mL to 1.0 mu g/mL and detection limit of 0.5 ng/mL (S/N = 3). This strategy combining the BPE-ECL and visual ratiometry provided an accurate and intrinsic way for the sensing of PSA and showed good perspective in the clinical diagnosis.

AB Cadmium doped antimony oxide (Cd-doped Sb2O4) nanostructures (CAO-NSs) were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method in alkaline phase at low temperature to detect the melamine from aqueous solution. The calcined CAO-NSs were characterized systematically by FE-SEM, EDS, UV/Vis., FTIR spectroscopy, powder XRD, and XPS techniques. The glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was modified with the CAO-NSs and sensing performance towards the selective melamine was explored by the electrochemical approach in phosphate buffer solution. The melamine undergoes a reduction reaction in the presence of CAO-NSs/GCE in PBS. The CAO-NSs/GCE attained the higher sensitivity (3.153 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2)) for a wide ranges of concentration (LDR: 0.05 nM-0.5 mM), an ultra-low limit of detection (LOD: 14.0 +/- 0.05 p.M.; S/N = 3), long-term stability, excellent repeatability, and reproducibility. This method might represent an efficient way of sensitive sensor development for the toxic melamine and their derivatives for the safety of biomedical and health care fields in broad scales.

AB The facile preparation of highly sensitive electrochemical bioprobe based on lutetium phthalocyanine incorporated silica nanoparticles (SiO2(LuPc2)) grafted with Poly(vinyl alcohol-vinyl acetate) itaconic acid (PANI (PVIA)) doped polyaniline conducting nanobeads (SiO2(LuPc2)PANI(PVIA)-CNB) is reported. The preparation of CNB involves two stages (i) pristine synthesis of LuPc2 incorporated SiO2 and PANI(PVIA); (ii) covalent grafting of PANI(PVIA) onto the surface of SiO2(LuPc2). The morphology and other physico-chemical characteristics of CNB were investigated. The scanning electron microscopy images show that the average particle size of SiO2(LuPc2)PANI(PVIA)-CNB was between 180-220 nm. The amperometric measurements showed that the fabricated SiO2(LuPc2)PANI(PVIA)-CNB/GOx biosensor exhibited wide linear range (1-16 mM) detection of glucose with a low detection limit of 0.1 mM. SiO2(LuPc2)PANI(PVIA)-CNB/GOx biosensor exhibited high sensitivity (38.53 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2)) towards the detection of glucose under optimized conditions. Besides, the real (juice and serum) sample analysis based on a standard addition method and direct detection method showed high precision for measuring glucose at SiO2(LuPc2)PANI(PVIA)-CNB/GOx biosensor. The SiO2(LuPc2)PANI (PVIA)-CNB/GOx biosensor stored under refrigerated condition over a period of 45 days retains similar to 96.4% glucose response current.

AB The biosensors capable for on-site continuous and online monitoring of pollutants in environment are highly desired due to their practical importance and convenience. The group specific detection of pollutants is especially attractive due to the diversity of environmental pollutants. Here we devise an evanescent wave aptasensor based on target binding facilitated fluorescence quenching (FQ-EWA) for the online continuous and group specific detection of aminoglycoside antibiotics (AMGAs). In FQ-EWA, a fluorophore labeled DNA aptamer selected against kanamycin was used for both the target recognition in solution and signal transduction on optical fiber of EWA. The aptamers form multiple-strand complex (M-Apt) in the absence of AMGAs. The binding between AMGA and the aptamer disrupts M-Apt and leads to the formation of AMGA-aptamer complex (AMGA-Apt). The photo-induced electron transfer between the fluorophore and AMGA partially quenches the fluorescence of AMGA-Apt. The structure-selective absorption of AMGA-Apt over M-Apt on the graphene oxide further quenches the fluorescence of AMGA-Apt. Meanwhile, the unbound aptamers in solution assemble with the unlabeled aptamers immobilized on the fiber to form M-Apt. The amount of M-Apt on the fiber is inversely proportional to the concentration of AMGAs, enabling the signal-off detection of AMGAs from 200 nM to 200 mu M with a detection limit of 26 nM. The whole detection process is carried out in an online mode without any offline operation, providing a great benefit for system automation and miniaturization. FQ-EWA also shows great surface regeneration capability and enables the continuous detection more than 60 times.

AB Interleukin 8 (IL-8), also known as C-X-C motif ligand 8(CXCL8), is a proinflammatory chemokine functioned in neutrophil chemotaxis and activation. And it plays an important role in the process of glioma stem-like cell vascularization in the latest research. Herein, a dual-function microfluidic biosensor based on rolling circle amplification (RCA) was fabricated for cell culture and online IL-8 detection. A microfluidic chip was designed with two high passages connected by the vertical channels. One of the channels with immobilized capture antibody was prepared for IL-8 detection and another channel for cell culture. Immunoassays were achieved by a sandwich structure consisting of antibodies, IL-8, and aptamers. Signal amplification was mainly due to RCA and biotin-streptavidin linkage. The linear range for IL-8 was 7.5 -120 pg mL(-1) in this assay. Moreover, the developed method was successfully applied to detect the IL-8 in tumor-derived endothelial cells (TDEC) and Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial cells (HUVEC) under chemical hypoxia condition. Semi-quantitative detection of IL-8 consumption in HUVEC cells in low oxygen condition was also achieved. These results were in statistical agreement with those obtained by commercial assay of enzyme-linked immunoassay kit (ELBA). The microfluidic chip based biosensor reported hereby has a large prospect in the basic research and clinical diagnosis of cancer stem cell.

AB A rapid and low cost photoluminescence (PL) immunosensor for the determination of low concentrations of Ochratoxin A (OTA) has been developed. This immunosensor was based on porous silicon (PSi) and modified by antibodies against OTA (anti-OTA). PSi layer was fabricated by metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) procedure. Main structural parameters (pore size, layer thickness, morphology and nanograins size) and composition of PSi were investigated by means of X-Ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy. PL-spectroscopy of PSi was performed at room temperature and showed a wide emission band centered at 680 +/- 20 nm. Protein A was covalently immobilized on the surface of PSi, which in next steps was modified by anti-OTA and BSA in this way a anti-OTA/Protein-A/PSi structure sensitive towards OTA was designed. The anti-OTA/Protein-A/PSi-based immunosensors were tested in a wide range of OTA concentrations from 0.001 upto 100 ng/ml. Interaction of OTA with anti-OTA/Protein-A/PSi surface resulted in the quenching of photoluminescence in comparison to bare PSi. The limit of detection (LOD) and the sensitivity range of anti-OTA/Protein-A/PSi immunosensors were estimated. Association constant and Gibbs free energy for the interaction of anti-OTA/Protein-A/PSi with OTA were calculated and, analyzed using the interaction isotherms. Response time of the anti-OTA/Protein-A/PSi-based immunosensor toward OTA was in the range of 500-700 s. These findings are very promising for the development of highly sensitive, and potentially portable immunosensors suitable for fast determination of OTA in food and beverages.

AB The measurement of Na+, K+ and H+ is essential in medicine and plays an important role in the assessment of tissue ischemia. Microfabrication, inkjet- and screen-printing can be used for solid contact ion selective electrodes (ISE) realization; these, however, can be non-standardized, costly and time consuming processes. We present the realization of ISEs on post-processed electrodes fabricated via standardized printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing techniques. In vitro results are presented from two rigid platforms (32 ISEs) for liquid sample dip-stick measurements and two flexible platforms (6 and 32 ISEs) for post-surgical intestinal tissue monitoring, each with a common reference electrode (RE). These are combined with optimized tetrapolar bioimpedance sensors for tissue ischemia detection. Both electroless and hard gold PCB finishes are examined. Apart from the electroless rigid platform, the rest demonstrated comparable and superior performance, with the pH sensors demonstrating the greatest deviation; the flexible hard gold platform achieved a sensitivity 4.6 mV/pH and 49.2 mV/pH greater than the electroless flexible and rigid platforms, respectively. The best overall performance was achieved with the hard gold flexible platform with sensitivities as large as 73.4 mV/pH, 56.3 mV/log [Na+], and 57.4 mV/log [K+] vs. custom REs on the same substrate. Simultaneous measurement of target analytes is demonstrated with test solutions and saliva samples. The results demonstrate superior performance to other PCB-based pH sensors and Na+ and K+ PCB-based sensors with comparable performance to potentiometric sensors fabricated with other techniques, paving the way towards mass-produced, low-cost, disposable, multi-parametric chemical sensing diagnostic platforms.

AB Nonspecific binding or adsorption of biomolecules presents as a major obstacle to higher sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility in microarray technology. We report herein a method to fabricate antifouling microarray via photopolymerization of biomimetic betaine compounds. In brief, carboxybetaine methacrylate was polymerized as arrays for protein sensing, while sulfobetaine methacrylate was polymerized as background. With the abundant carboxyl groups on array surfaces and zwitterionic polymers on the entire surfaces, this microarray allows biomolecular immobilization and recognition with low nonspecific interactions due to its antifouling property. Therefore, low concentration of target molecules can be captured and detected by this microarray. It was proved that a concentration of 10 ng mL(-1) bovine serum albumin in the sample matrix of bovine serum can be detected by the microarray derivatized with anti-bovine serum albumin. Moreover, with proper hydrophilic hydrophobic designs, this approach can be applied to fabricate surface-tension droplet arrays, which allows surface-directed cell adhesion and growth. These light controllable approaches constitute a clear improvement in the design of antifouling interfaces, which may lead to greater flexibility in the development of interfacial architectures and wider application in blood contact microdevices.

AB In this study, we aim to design a simple and effective electrochemical DNA biosensor based on a carbon paste electrode modified with ds-DNA/poly(L-cysteine)/Fe3O4 nanoparticles-graphene oxide (ds-DNA/p(L-Cys)/Fe3O4 NPs-GO/CPE) for sensitive detection of adenine (A) and guanine (G). The electrocatalytic oxidation of A and G on the electrode was explored by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). This sensor shows separated and well-defined peaks for A and G, by which one can determine these biological bases individually or simultaneously. The ds-DNA/p(L-Cys)/Fe3O4 NPs-GO/CPE exhibited an increase in peak currents and the electron transfer kinetics and decrease in the overpotential for the oxidation reaction of A and G. Under the optimal conditions a linear relationship is figured out between the peak current and the analytes' concentrations on a range of 0.01-30.0 mu M and 0.01-25.0 mu M for simultaneous determination of A and G, with detection limits of 3.48 and 1.59 nM, respectively. As well as, individually determination is resulted two linear concentration ranges of 0.01-30.0 mu M for A and 0.01-25.0 mu M for G with detection limits of 3.90 and 1.58 nM for A and G, respectively. The proposed biosensor exhibited some advantages in terms of simplicity, rapidity, high sensitivity, good reproducibility and long-term stability. Furthermore, the measurements of thermally denatured single-stranded DNA were carried out and the value of (G + C)/(A + T) of DNA was calculated as about 0.77 for various DNA samples. This study also ascertained that the proposed biosensor can be profitable to evaluate DNA bases damage.

AB We develop a reusable ratiometric electrochemical biosensor on the basis of the binding of methylene blue (MB) to DNA with alternating AT base sequence for sensitive detection of adenosine. We design a strand 1 with MB modified thymine (T) base in the proximal 3' termini as the capture probe for its immobilization on the gold electrode and a 3' termini ferrocene (Fc)-modified aptamer for the recognition of adenosine. The hybridization of strand 1 with the aptamer leads to the formation of a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and consequently the away of MB from the electrode surface and the close of Fc to the electrode surface, generating a small value of I-MB/I-FC (I-MB and I-FC are the peak currents of MB and Fc, respectively). In the presence of adenosine, its binding with the aptamer induces the release of Fc from the electrode surface and the close of MB to the electrode surface, generating a large value of I-MB/I-FC. As a result, adenosine may be accurately quantified by the measurement of ratiometric signal (I-MB/I-FC). This ratiometric electrochemical biosensor can be simply fabricated and exhibits high sensitivity with a limit of detection of as low as 90.8 pM and a large dynamic range from 0.1 nM to 100 mu M. Moreover, this biosensor demonstrates good performance with excellent selectivity, regeneration capability, high reliability and good reproducibility, and may become a universal platform for the detection of various biomolecules which can be recognized by aptamers, holding great potential for further applications in biomedical research and clinical diagnosis.

AB Blood typing assay is a critical test to ensure the serological compatibility of a donor and an intended recipient prior to a blood transfusion. This paper presents a microfluidic blood typing system using a small quantity of blood sample to determine the degree of agglutination of red blood cell (RBC). Two measuring methods were proposed: impedimetric measurement and electroanalytical measurement. The charge transfer resistance in the impedimetric measurement and the power parameter in the electroanalytical measurement were used for the analysis of agglutination level. From the experimental results, both measuring methods provide quantitative results, and the parameters are linearly and monotonically related to the degree of RBC agglutination. However, the electroanalytical measurement is more reliable than the impedimetric technique because the impedimetric measurement may suffer from many influencing factors, such as chip conditions. Five levels from non-agglutination (level 0) to strong agglutination (level 4+) can be discriminated in this study, conforming to the clinical requirement to prevent any risks in transfusion.

AB The application of Surface Plasmon Resonance Imaging (SPRi) for the detection of transmembrane antigen of the Rhesus (Rh) blood group system is demonstrated. Clinically significant Rh blood group system antigens, including D, C, E, c, and e, can be simultaneously identified via solid phase immobilization assay, which offers significant time savings and assay simplification. Red blood cells (RBCs) flowed through the micro-channel, where a suitable condition for Rh blood group detection was an RBC dilution of 1:10 with a stop-flow condition. Stop flow showed an improvement in specific binding compared to continuous flow. Rh antigens required a longer incubation time to react with the immobilized antibody than A and B antigens due to the difference in antigen type and their location on the RBC. The interaction between the immobilized antibodies and their specific antigenic counterpart on the RBC showed a significant difference in RBC removal behavior using shear flow, measured from the decay of the SPR signal. The strength of the interaction between the immobilized antibody and RBC antigen was determined from the minimum wall shear stress required to start the decay process in the SPR signal. For a given range of immobilized antibody surface densities, the Rh antigen possesses a stronger interaction than A, B, and AB antigens. Identification of 82 samples of ABO and Rh blood groups using SPRi showed good agreement with the standard micro-column agglutination technique. A wider coverage of antigenic recognition for RBC when using the solid phase immobilization assay was demonstrated for the RBC with the antigenic site located on the transmembrane protein of the clinically significant Rh antigen. Given the level of accuracy and precision, the technique showed potential for the detection of the Rh minor blood group system.

AB A series of sodium selective membranes with magnetic nano-inclusions using p-tertbutyl calix[4]arene as ionophore and polymeric matrix (polyvinyl chloride) have been developed, and the corresponding sodium selective sensors were obtained for the first time. A linear range was registered between 3.1 x 10(-5) and 10(-1) mol dm(-3) and near Nemstian electrochemical answer: 55.73 mV/decade has been recoreded for PVC (polyvinyl chloride) - based sodium selective sensor, with a response time of 45 s. Due to their small dimensions, sensors could be used for measuring ions from the gingival crevicular fluid directly into the peri-odontal pocket, avoiding the difficulties of collecting an appropriate amount of fluid for analysis. Alterations in the inorganic ions level could be evidenced with this new device, assisting the early diagnosis and prevention of periodontal disease.

AB A simple, efficient and sensitive molecularly imprinted electrochemiluminescence sensor (MIECLS) based on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) was developed for determination of clenbuterol (CLB). In this study, rGO generated by electrodeposition of graphene oxide not only acted as carrier for immobilizing UCNPs, but also had a significant impact in boosting electrochemiluminescence (ECL) response of UCNPs thanks to its high conductivity, superior electron transport rate and large specific surface area. UCNPs as an advanced ECL emitter possessed wonderful ECL performance. Furthermore, the introduction of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP) endowed the ECL sensor a new character of specifically identifying analyte CLB. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the ECL signal was proportional to the logarithm of CLB concentration in the range of 10 nM to 100 mu M with a low detection limit of 6.3 nM. The proposed MIECLS combining the advantages of UCNPs-ECL and MW exhibited good sensitivity, desirable selectivity and favorable stability, indicating enormous potential in the future of food safety detection.

AB Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene (rs1801177) is strongly associated with the increased progression of atherosclerosis, threatening global public health. In this work, a relatively simple, specific and ultrasensitive electrochemical DNA biosensor was constructed to detect rs1801177 for the first time. A glass carbon electrode was modified with fullerene (C-60)/polyamidoamine (PAMAM)/gold (Au) nanoparticles nanocomposites film. In addition the nitrogen-doped graphene (N-G)/palladium platinum (PdPt) bimetallic nanoparticle/ polyaniline (PANI) nanohybrids were synthesised and used to label the signal probes. These nanohybrids have abundant active groups, and efficient redox and catalytic activity, allowing them to be used as the nanocarrier for a redox nanoprobe without the additional modification of electroactive substance and catalyst, which could effectively simplify the operation procedure and shorten the analysis time. With the catalysis of H2O2 by nanohybrids, the detection signal of N-G/PdPt/PANI itself could be significantly enhanced, lead to the improvement of the sensitivity. Under optimal conditions, the electrochemical DNA biosensor exhibited desirable performance for the determination of rs1801177 with a wide linearity ranging from 10 fM to 10 nM and a relatively low detection limit of 3.33 IM (S/N=3). The proposed biosensor showed excellent selectivity to the target DNA compared to possible interfering substances. The results suggested that this method has potential applications in clinical research.

AB Brettanomyces is a yeast species responsible for wine and cider spoilage, producing volatile phenols that result in off-odors and loss of fruity sensorial qualities. Current commercial detection methods for these spoilage species are liable to frequent false positives, long culture times and fungal contamination. In this work, an interdigitated (IDE) biosensor was created to detect Brettanomyces using immunological reactions and impedance spectroscopy analysis. To promote efficient antibody immobilization on the electrodes' surface and to decrease non-specific adsorption, a Self-Assembled Monolayer (SAM) was developed. An impedance spectroscopy analysis, over four yeast strains, confirmed our device's increased efficacy. Compared to label-free sensors, antibody biosensors showed a higher relative impedance. The results also suggested that these biosensors could be a promising method to monitor some spoilage yeasts, offering an efficient alternative to the laborious and expensive traditional methods.

The PDQCM and the GPE modified with PDQCM were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and electrochemistry methods such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The proposed modified electrode exhibits high electrocatalytic activity toward electrooxidation of AP, Ph, and NP to three well-separated peaks in the potential range from 0.2 to 1.3 V using CV and DPV methods in phosphate buffer solution with pH 2.0. Under the optimum conditions, detection limits of 0.5, 0.6 and 0.8 mu M were obtained for AP, Ph, and NP, respectively. Moreover, GPE/PDQCM was successfully used for simultaneous determination of AP, Ph, and NP in tap and river waters.

AB This manuscript describes a bioelectrochemical application of a new class of electrochemically generated hole-transporting (p-type) polymeric semiconductors (HTPS), which are based on a carbazole core and the oxiran and thiiran reactive groups. Electrode based on transparent layer of indium tin oxide was electrochemically modified with a layer of HTPS and a monolayer of covalently immobilized glucose oxidase (GOx). The HTPS/GOx-based electrode was investigated for an evaluation of direct hole-transfer between the enzyme and electrode at a bio-electrochemically relevant potential via HTPS layer. The broad linear relationship between the peak-current density and glucose concentration from 2 to 15 mM and high stability of ITO/poly-CzS/GOx-electrode was observed. Moreover, it was determined that charge transfer rate constants are reliable for the establishment of advanced electron transfer between enzyme and electrode for the application of this HTPS/GOx-based electrode in long-lived biofuel cells and amperometric biosensors.

AB In this work, we report the development of a general strategy for enhancing the efficiency of target capture in immunoassays, using a bifunctional fusion protein construct which incorporates a substrate-anchoring moiety for the high-abundance immobilization of an antigen-binding domain. This approach was informed by the development of a pseudo first-order rate constant model, and tested in a paper-based assay format using a fusion construct consisting of an rcSso7d binding module and a cellulose-binding domain. These rcSso7d-CBD fusion proteins were solubly expressed and purified from bacteria in high molar yields, and enable oriented, high density adsorption of the rcSso7d binding species to unmodified cellulose within a 30-second incubation period. These findings were validated using two distinct, antigen-specific rcSso7d variants, which were isolated from a yeast surface display library via flow cytometry. Up to 1.6 micromoles of rcSso7d-CBD was found to adsorb per gram of cellulose, yielding a volume-averaged binder concentration of up to 760 M within the resulting active material. At this molar abundance, the target antigen is captured from solution with nearly 100% efficiency, maximizing the attainable sensitivity for any given diagnostic system.

AB One major marker of nitrosative stress is the formation of 3-Nitrotyrosine (3-NT) from Tyrosine (Tyr) by adding a nitro group (-NO2) with nitrating agents. Nitration of Tyr often causes loss of protein activity and is linked with many diseases. In this article, we detect 3-NT and discriminate it from Tyr with Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV) as it is a very important biomarker. We first examined redox (oxidation/reduction) properties and stability of 3-NT in detail. Second, we provided the Tyr and 3-NT discrimination with DPV and compared with the chromatography. We then explored the interaction of 3-NT and DNA oligonucleotides. Our findings demonstrate that 3-NT can be used as a new electrochemical indicator, which is able to detect hybridization of probe (single stranded DNA-ssDNA) and hybrid (double stranded DNA-dsDNA) both via 3-NT reduction and guanine oxidation signal changes at the same time. The signal differences enabled us to distinguish ssDNA and dsDNA without using a label or a tag. Moreover, we achieved to detect hybridization of DNA by using the reduction signal of 3-NT obtained at -0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl. More importantly, we observed the changes of the reduction signals of 3-NT after the interaction of probe and hybrid sequences. We showed that 3-NT signal decreases more with hybrid than the probe. Our platform, for the first time, demonstrates the detection of hybridization both guanine oxidation and indicator reduction signal changes at the same time. Moreover, we, for the first time, demonstrated the interaction between 3-NT and DNA.

AB The nanoparticles comprising of iron core and carbon shell were decorated with ferrocene derivatives: ferrocenecarboxaldehyde (Fc-1) and ferrocenecarboxaldehyde oxime (Fc-2). A microdrop of suspension of the nanoconjugate was placed on a glassy-carbon electrode to prepare the recognition/sensing layer. Drying and purification of the sensing layer resulted in a well-defined and stable square-wave voltammogram of the ferrocene moiety. The height of the voltammetric peak increased in the presence of ceruloplasmin. That increase was linearly dependent on the logarithmic concentration of ceruloplasmin in blood. The applied external magnetic field was a factor which yielded better sensitivity and repeatability of the sensor response. The linearity of sensor response was found to be between 0.001 and 10 mu g dL(-1) and 0.05-10 mu g dL(-1) for both nanoconjugates: Fe@C-Fc-1 and Fe@C-Fc-2, in the presence and absence of the magnet, respectively. The obtained detection limit (LOD) for Fe@C-Fc-1 was found to be 0.60 and 0.10 mu g dL(-1) in the absence and presence of magnetic field, respectively, whilst for Fe@C-Fc-2 was 0.4 and 0.07 mu g dL(-1) in the absence and presence of a magnet, respectively. The proposed method is selective because the presence of common antioxidants in blood did not interfere significantly with the determination of the concentration of ceruloplasmin.

AB Silicon nitride (SiNX) based biosensors have the potential to converge on the technological achievements of semiconductor microfabrication and biotechnology. Development of biofunctionalized SiNX surface and its integration with other devices will allow us to integrate the biosensing capability with probe control, data acquisition and data processing. Here we use the hydrogen plasma generated by inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE) technique to produce amino-functionality on the surface of SiNX which can then be readily used for biomolecule immobilization. ICP-RIE produces high-density hydrogen ions/radicals at low energy, which produces high-density amino group on the SiNX surface within a short duration of time and with minimal surface damage. In this work, we have demonstrated selective amination of SiNX surface as compared to Si surface. The as-activated SiNX surface can be readily biofunctionalized with both protein and oligonucleotide through covalent immobilization. N-5-azido-2-nitrobenzoyloxysuccinimide, a photoactivable amino reactive bifunctional crosslinker, was used and greater than 90% surface coverage was achieved for protein immobilization. In addition, ssDNA immobilization and hybridization with its complemented strand was shown. Thus, we demonstrate a uniform, reliable, fast and economical technique for creating biofunctionalized SiNX surface that can be used for developing compact high-sensitivity biosensors.

AB Traditionally, genomic DNA detection is relay on a rigorous DNA amplification process, which always accompanied with complicated gel electrophoresis or expensive fluorescence detection methods. In this work, we have translated genomic DNA detection into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) test based on a split aptamer-based electrochemical sandwich assay. The key characteristic of our method are list as follows: first, nucleic acid amplification of the target gene was performed by the use of a loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) process. The pyrophosphate (PPi), which released as the byproduct during the LAMP reaction, were further converted into ATP in the presence of adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) and ATP sulfurylase. Thereafter, the converted ATP was detected by constructing an electrochemical sandwich aptasensor. With such design, the conversion from the difficult detecting target (genomic DNA) into a convenient measured object (ATP) has been achieved. This proposed strategy was highly sensitive for Nosema bombycis genomic DNA PTP1 detection with a detection limit as low as 0.47 fg/mu L and a linear range from 0.001 pg/mu L to 50 ng/mu L. And we supposed that this novel target conversion electroanalytical strategy established a universal approach for quantitative analysis of any other kinds of nucleic acid in assistance of nucleic acid polymerization reaction.

AB Fatty-add binding proteins (FABP) and myeloperoxidases (MPO) are associated with many chronic conditions in humans and considered to be important biomarkers for diagnosis of cardiac diseases. Here we assemble a new electrical biosensor platform based on graphene-coated interdigitated electrode arrays (IDE-arrays) towards ultrafast, label-free screening of heart type-FABP and MPO. Arrays of nanoscale (nanoIDE) and microscale (microIDE) electrode-arrays were fabricated on wafer-scale by combining nanoimprint and photolithography processes. Chemical vapor deposition grown multilayer graphene was transferred onto nano/microIDE-arrays and used as a high surface-to-volume ratio electrical transducer. Novel biofunctional layers of specially engineered anti-h-FABP and anti-MPO single-chain fragment variables (scFv) were immobilized onto graphene-coated IDE-array sensor platform for electrical detection of h-FABP and MPO in physiological saline. scFv fragments show increased sensitivity in comparison to the state-of-the-art competitive ELISA for their higher affinity towards target analytes. Deploying FABP and MPO specific scFvs as receptor molecules onto our high sensitivity graphene-coated IDE-arrays with identical sensor characteristics and assays covering clinically relevant concentrations in physiological saline, we demonstrate realization of a simple and versatile biosensor platform capable of high performance cardiac-bioassays for point-of-care applications.

AB In this study, a dual-type responsive electrochemical immunosensor was developed for the quantitative detection of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a potential biomarker of cardiovascular disease in serum. N-doped graphene nanoribbons (N-GNRs) with good conductivity were used as the sensing matrix modifying the glassy carbon electrode. Palladium platinum alloy (PdPt) nanoparticles with high catalytic performance toward the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were reduced onto amino-functionalized fullerene (n-C-60-PdPt) and significantly amplified the electrochemical signal recorded by the amperometric i-t curve. Furthermore, staphylococcus protein A (SPA) with antibody orientation function was introduced to improve the immunoreaction efficiency. Accordingly, a label-free immunosensor was fabricated based on n-C-60-PdPt/NGNRs for the quick detection of PCSK9. Meanwhile, to realize ultrasensitive detection of PCSK9, Pt-poly (methylene blue) (Pt-PMB) nanocomposites synthesized by a one-pot method for the first time were used as a novel signal label, which exhibited uniform morphology as well as good conductivity and produced an electrochemical signal recorded by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Herein, a novel sandwich-type immunosensor was designed using n-C-60-PdPt/N-GNRs as the sensing matrix and Pt-PMB as the signal label for sensitive detection of PCSK9. Under optimal conditions, the label-free immunosensor showed a linear range of 10 pg mL(-1) to 100 ng mL(-1) with a detection limit of 3.33 pg mL(-1) (S/N = 3), and the sandwich-type immunosensor exhibited a linear range of 100 fg mL(-1) to 100 ng mL(-1) with a detection limit of 0.033 pg mL(-1) (S/N = 3) for PCSK9 detection, indicating its potential application in clinical bioassay analysis.

AB In this study, Ag/TiO2/3D nitrogen doped graphene hydrogel (3DNGH) was prepared for the first time and the photocurrent intensity of this material was greatly enhanced, which was attributed to the multiple enhancements accomplished in one step. The porous structure of 3DNGH could provide an exceptionally large accessible surface area, which was beneficial for the anchoring of Ag and TiO2 nanoparticles. The introduction of nitrogen doped graphene and metal nanoparticles was capable to facilitate the charge separation efficiency and accelerate the transfer rate of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Then the photoelectrochemical performance was further amplified by the localized surface plasmon resonance of Ag nanoparticles. On the basis of excellent PEC properties of Ag/TiO2/3DNGH, a sensitive label-free PEC sensor has been established for the determination of thrombin successfully. This proposed PEC biosensor exhibited good PEC performances with a wide linear in the range from 0.01 p.M. to 10 p.M. as well as a relative low detection limit of 3 fM (S/N = 3), indicating that Ag/TiO2/3DNGH would serve as a promising photoactive material in the applications of PEC biosensors.

AB Biomarkers in tears have attracted much attention in daily healthcare sensing and monitoring. Here, highly sensitive sensors for simultaneous detection of glucose and uric acid are successfully constructed based on solution-gated graphene transistors (SGGTs) with two separate Au gate electrodes, modified with GOx-CHIT and BSA-CHIT respectively. The sensitivity of the SGGT is dramatically improved by co-modifying the Au gate with ZIF-67 derived porous Co3O4 hollow nanopolyhedrons. The sensing mechanism for glucose sensor is attributed to the reaction of H2O2 generated by the oxidation of glucose near the gate, while the sensing mechanism for uric acid is due to the direct electro-oxidation of uric acid molecules on the gate. The optimized glucose and uric acid sensors show the detection limits both down to 100 nM, far beyond the sensitivity required for non-invasive detection of glucose and uric acid in tears. The glucose and uric acid in real tear samples was quantitatively detected at 323.2 +/- 16.1 mu M and 98.5 +/- 16.3 mu M by using the functionalized SGGT device. Due to the low-cost, high-biocompatibility and easy-fabrication features of the ZIF-67 derived porous Co3O4 hollow nanopolyhedron, they provide excellent electrocatalytic nanomaterials for enhancing sensitivity of SGGTs for a broad range of disease-related biomarkers.

AB The interaction between gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and nucleic acids has facilitated a variety of diagnostic applications, with further diversification of synthesis match bio-applications while reducing biotoxicity. However, DNA interactions with unique surface capping agents have not been fully defined. Using dextrin capped AuNPs (d-AuNPs), we have developed a novel unamplified genomic DNA (gDNA) nanosensor, exploiting dispersion and aggregation characteristics of d-AuNPs, in the presence of gDNA, for sequence-specific detection. We demonstrate that d-AuNPs are stable in a five-fold greater salt concentration than citrate-capped AuNPs and the d-AuNPs were stabilized by single stranded DNA probe (ssDNAp). However, in the elevated salt concentrations of the DNA detection assay, the target reactions were surprisingly further stabilized by the formation of a ssDNAp-target gDNA complex. The results presented herein lead us to propose a mechanism whereby genomic ssDNA secondary structure formation during ssDNAp-to-target gDNA binding enables d-AuNP stabilization in elevated ionic environments. Using the assay described herein, we were successful in detecting as little as 2.94 fM of pathogen DNA, and using crude extractions of a pathogen matrix, as few as 18 spores/mu L.

AB In this work, we demonstrated a nano-decorated porous impedance electrode sensor for efficient capture, rapid killing and ultrasensitive detection of bacteria. The multi-functional sensor was prepared by a facile sono-chemical method via in situ deposition of antibacterial prickly Zn-CuO nanoparticles and graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets on a Ni porous electrode. Due to the surface burr-like nanostructures, the nano-decorated impedance sensor exhibited very good bacterial-capture efficiency (70 - 80% in 20 min) even at a low concentration of 50 CFU mL(-1), rapid antibacterial rate (100% killing in 30 min) and high detection sensitivity (as low as 10 CFU mL(-1)). More importantly, the nano-decorated sensor has proven to be highly effective in quantitative detection of bacteria in a biological sample, for example, a rat blood sample spiked with E. coll. Despite the complexity of blood, the sensor still exhibited excellent detection precision within 30 min at bacteria concentrations ranging from 10 - 10(5) CFU mL(-1). The simplicity, rapidity, sensitivity, practicability and multifunctionality of this impedance sensor would greatly facilitate applications in portable medical devices for on-the-spot diagnosis and even the possibility for simultaneous therapy of diseases caused by bacterial infections.

AB A novel three-dimensional (3D) carbon composite of PANI(1600)@CNTs with rhizobium-like structure is prepared by in-situ polymerization of aniline monomers around and along the functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and then carbonized at 1600 degrees C for enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs). The SEM and TEM images clearly show that the carbonized PANI grew seamlessly on the surface of CNTs and presented the rhizobium-like structure. The carbonized PANI acts like conductive "glue" and connects the adjacent tubes together, which can assemble the CNTs into a 3D network. The PANI(1600)@CNTs composite modified glassy carbon electrodes based on glucose oxidase (GOx) and laccase (Lac) exhibit high electrochemical performance. A glucose//O-2 EBFC constitutes of the fabricated anode and cathode performs a maximum power density of 1.12 mW cm(-2) at 0.45 V. Furthermore, three of the fabricated EBFCs in series are able to lightening up a yellow light-emitting diode (LED) whose turn on voltage is about at 1.8 V. This work may be helpful for exploiting novel substrates by carbonizing the composites of conducting polymer with nano materials at high-temperature for immobilization of enzymes in the EBFCs or biosensor fields.
