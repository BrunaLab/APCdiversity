TI Lymphocytic Hypophysitis Secondary to Ruptured Rathke Cleft Cyst: Case
   Report and Literature Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

ID AUTOIMMUNE HYPOPHYSITIS; DISEASE; WOMAN
AB BACKGROUND: Lymphocytic hypophysitis is a rare inflammatory lesion in the sellar region. Lymphocytic hypophysitis secondary to ruptured Rathke cleft cyst (RCC) is even more rarely seen. Clinical characteristics, treatment strategies, and prognosis remain elusive.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 58-year-old Chinese woman with a 3-year history of intermittent headache and new development of polydipsia, polyuria, and binocular visual acuity decline over the past 4 months was admitted to our hospital. On admission, endocrine results were normal. Ophthalmic testing showed bitemporal visual field deficits and decreased visual acuity of both eyes. Pituitary dynamic magnetic resonance imaging showed a cystic sellar lesion measuring 5.6 3 5.2 3 6.2 mm with tumor shrinkage compared with initial neuroimaging. Transsphenoidal surgery was performed for tumor resection. An additional biopsy of the anterior pituitary lobe was performed because of intraoperative abnormal appearances of the pituitary gland. Pathology examinations revealed the specimen of the cystic lesion to be RCC and exhibited infiltration of massive lymphocytes, diffused plasmocytes, and eosinophils that were diagnostic of lymphocytic hypophysitis in the anterior pituitary lobe. During follow-up, the lesion of lymphocytic hypophysitis showed spontaneous shrinkage in the absence of steroid treatment after RCC resection. Final diagnosis was lymphocytic hypophysitis secondary to ruptured RCC.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present a rare case of lymphocytic hypophysitis secondary to ruptured RCC and provide clinical data of such lesions in the literature. Full understanding of the clinical features plays an important role in diagnosis and treatment of lymphocytic hypophysitis secondary to ruptured RCC.

ID VERTEBROBASILAR INSUFFICIENCY; POSTERIOR CIRCULATION; REVASCULARIZATION;
   DISEASE; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Superficial temporal artery (STA) to superior cerebellar artery (SCA) bypass is associated with a relatively high risk of surgical complications, such as hematoma and/or edema caused by temporal lobe retraction. Therefore, the right side is typically used to avoid retraction of the left temporal lobe. In this report, we present a case of left STA-SCA bypass with anterior petrosectomy to avoid retraction of dominant-side temporal lobe and describe the surgical technique in detail.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 69-year-old man presented with gradual worsening of dysarthria and gait disturbance. Magnetic resonance imaging showed no signs of acute infarction, but digital subtraction angiography showed severe stenosis of basilar artery and faint flow in the distal basilar artery. On 3-dimensional computed tomography angiography, posterior communicating arteries were not visualized; we could identify the left SCA, but not the right SCA. Despite dual antiplatelet therapy, a small fresh brainstem infarct was detected 10 days after admission. To avert fatal brainstem infarction and further enlargement of the infarct, we performed left STA-SCA bypass with anterior petrosectomy to avoid retraction of the dominant-side temporal lobe. Postoperative imaging revealed no new lesions, such as infarction or temporal lobe contusional hematoma, and confirmed the patency of the bypass. Postoperative single-photon emission computed tomography demonstrated improved cerebral blood flow in the posterior circulation. The patient was transferred to another hospital for rehabilitation.
   CONCLUSIONS: This method helps minimize the risk of injury to the temporal lobe, especially that of the dominant side.

AB BACKGROUND: Hemangioblastomas usually occur in the cerebellum and are often a component of von Hippel-Lindau disease. Edema-like changes along the optic tract are commonly observed in association with tumors in the sellar and suprasellar regions, such as craniopharyngiomas and pituitary adenomas. Here, we describe a case of sporadic suprasellar hemangioblastoma with edema-like changes along the optic tract that completely resolved after surgery.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 28-year-old woman with failing vision and a bitemporal hemianopia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a tumor accompanied by a 10-mm cyst. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery axial magnetic resonance imaging revealed a hyperintense region along the optic tract. Other regions of the central nervous system were normal. Endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery was performed, and the histopathologic findings confirmed hemangioblastoma. Six months after surgery, the edema-like change along the optic tract had disappeared. The patient is doing well without pituitary insufficiency, pituitary hormone medications, or signs of tumor recurrence. In addition, the genetic test was negative for von Hippel-Lindau mutations.
   CONCLUSIONS: When examining a patient with suprasellar tumor, clinicians must consider the possibility of hemangioblastoma. Adequate treatment can improve the edematous change and visual disturbance.

   REGION; TISSUE
AB BACKGROUND: Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia (IPEH), also known as Masson tumor, is a benign lesion consisting of a reactive proliferation of endothelial cells with papillary formations related to thrombi. It has been reported in many different anatomic areas. Gross total resection is the elected treatment. Intracranial IPEH is rare, and only a few cases have been reported. This article reports a complicated case of cavernous sinus Masson tumor.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 51-year-old woman presented because of hemicraneal headache, left facial paresthesia, and diplopia (due to a slight left ocular external rectum muscle paresis) that she had experienced the previous 60 days. She had previously received a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type I. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed a 3.5-cm contrastenhanced tumor adjacent to the left cavernous sinus involving the Meckel cave that extended around the distal petrous portion of the left internal carotid artery. Two possibilities as a differential diagnosis were suggested: meningioma or neurogenic tumor. After a staged surgical procedure, the histopathologic findings were unexpected and showed IPEH (Masson tumor) as the cause of the mass. Despite having benign features, the IPEH showed recurrences over time, so adjuvant 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy was initiated.
   CONCLUSIONS: IPEH is prone to recurrences after subtotal resection. In the present case, successful surgical treatment and adjuvant radiotherapy showed an excellent outcome. To date, no adjuvant therapy has been established as a go-to option.

TI Platelet Dysfunction and Intracerebral Hemorrhage in a Patient Treated

LA English
DT Article
DE Adverse drug reaction; Intracranial hemorrhage; Platelets
ID DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION; THROMBOCYTOPENIA; THERAPY
AB BACKGROUND: Piperacilline-tazobactam is common empiric antibiotic therapy. Hematologic laboratory test abnormalities were documented but rare in premarketing studies, and whether these alterations are of clinical significance has been studied little. Very few cases of piperacillin-induced bleeding, thrombocytopenia, or both have been reported; aberrations in platelet function have not been implicated.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 55-year old Vietnamese man with hypertension presented for treatment of an Intracranial hemorrhage. Platelet function assays (PFAs) at the time of external ventricular drain and quad-lumen bolt placement were normal, and imaging showed no hemorrhage after placement. The patient was later started on empiric piperacillin-tazobactam due to high suspicion for aspiration pneumonia. After removal of the quad-lumen bolt and external ventricular drain on separate days, both follow-up computed tomography scans showed new hematomas in the devices' tracts, with significant intraventricular hemorrhage. Repeat PFAs were abnormally prolonged, representing a distinct change from baseline. A trend toward normalization of PFAs was observed 6 hours after discontinuation of piperacillin-tazobactam with progression toward baseline thereafter.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is unique in that the significant bleeding that occurred was attributable to platelet dysfunction rather than thrombocytopenia. This is the first reported case of intracranial (periprocedural) hemorrhage potentially related to piperacillin-tazobactam; further research into this drug's impact upon qualitative platelet function is needed.

ID PLEURAL MESOTHELIOMA; PERINEURAL SPREAD; CORD METASTASIS; INVOLVEMENT;
   DIAGNOSIS; INVASION
AB BACKGROUND: Malignant mesotheliomas are aggressive and rapidly fatal neoplasms arising from the mesothelial cells. The most common sites of origin are the pleural and peritoneal cavities; the pericardium and the tunica vaginalis are infrequently involved, and malignant mesothelioma in the spinal canal is extremely rare. Here we report a case of primary spinal malignant mesothelioma. We also report the results of a literature search conducted in PubMed with specific key terms, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria, with a comparison of elected case studies and case series, and statistical analysis as appropriate.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 35-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of swelling and pain in the left lower extremity. Neurologic examination revealed a loss of sensation below the L5 dermatome. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a mass at the L4-5 level. A diagnosis of schwannoma was suspected, and surgical resection was performed. Histopathological findings were consistent with sarcomatoid malignant mesothelioma. Thoracic and whole-abdomen computed tomography yielded normal results. The patient refused adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Positron emission tomographye computed tomography performed at 3 months postoperatively showed no abnormality. At 8 months postoperatively, the patient developed back pain and difficulty with defecation; MRI demonstrated tumor recurrence. During a second operation, invasion of the vertebra and cauda equina was noted. A subtotal resection was achieved, and the pain was partially alleviated. Two months later, the patient succumbed to a traffic accident.
   CONCLUSIONS: Spinal malignant mesothelioma is an extremely rare but highly aggressive entity. Preoperative identification is challenging, and definitive diagnosis depends on histopathological evidence. Surgical resection can help relieve the symptoms, but the overall prognosis is poor.

   ANTERIOR; FUSION; LAMINOPLASTY; EXPERIENCE; DYSPHAGIA
AB BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive surgery of posterior cervical foraminotomy (PCF) for symptomatic radiculopathy has gained popularity in the last decade. It remains to be determined whether the 2 dominant operation techniques, full-endoscopic (FE) or microendoscopic (MI), are associated with fewer complications.
   METHODS: An electronic retrieval from PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science was performed to identify comparative or single-arm studies concerning FE-PCF and MI-PCF. The pooled incidence of complications was calculated.
   RESULTS: A total of 26 studies with 2028 patients (FE, 402; MI, 1626) were identified. The overall complication rate was 5.8% for FE-PCF and 3.5% for MIPCF, with no significant difference (P = 0.115). The pooled complication rate for single-level radiculopathy showed no statistical difference (FE, 4.5%; MI, 3.5%; P = 0.471), either. However, constituent of complications showed apparent disparity, with transient root palsy in FE-PCF (15/19, 78.9%) and dural tear (20/47, 42.6%) in MI-PCF being the most commonly reported. As for the subgroup analysis, both incidence of dural tear (FE, 1.5%; MI, 1.8%; P = 0.672) and superficial wound infection (FE, 2.2%; MI, 1.0%; P = 0.109) showed no statistical difference. Nevertheless, transient root palsy occurred at a higher incidence in the FE group than in the MI group (FE, 4.5%; MI, 1.5%; P = 0.002).
   CONCLUSIONS: Both FE-PCF and MI-PCF can offer relatively safe treatment for cervical radiculopathy. There is no significant difference in overall complication rate between the 2 techniques. Dural tear is the most commonly reported complication of MI-PCF, whereas transient root palsy deserves to be noticed for surgeons performing FE-PCF.

TI Buckling Collapse of Midcervical Spine Secondary to Neurofibromatosis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Editorial Material
DE Buckling collapse; Cervical spine; Kyphosis; Neurofibromatosis
AB Buckling collapse is the term typically used to describe severe kyphosis > 100 degrees, characteristically seen in thoracolumbar tuberculosis. Neurofibromatosis is rarely associated with severe cervical kyphosis. Dystrophic changes in vertebra make surgical correction and fusion challenging. Single-stage cervical osteotomies (e.g., pedicle subtraction osteotomy, vertebral column resection) are commonly done in cervicothoracic junction. However, it is technically challenging and associated with high risk of vertebral artery injury, neural injury, etc. when performed in higher cervical spine. Hence in our case we did a staged procedure performing circumferential osteotomy for buckling kyphosis in the midcervical spine. Because it involved midcervical spine and there was no chinto-chest deformity, we preferred the anterior-posterior-anterior sequence.

AB BACKGROUND: Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a rare condition occurring after organ transplantation. PTLD comprises 4 subtypes, of which Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) type and HL-like type (currently included in polymorphic type) account for only about 1%-3% of cases. Primary central nervous system PTLD is also rare; most cases are Epstein-Barr virusepositive, B-cell PTLD. To our knowledge, no case of HL-like PTLD has been documented.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 43-year-old woman who underwent kidney transplantation for IgA nephropathy 14 years previously presented to the emergency department with seizure. Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed a ring-enhancing mass in the left temporal lobe. Gross total removal of the tumor was performed, and pathologic examination revealed findings consistent with HL-like PTLD. The patient's immunosuppressants were subsequently reduced, and she received postoperative systemic therapy with rituximab and radiation therapy. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging showed no signs of relapse.
   CONCLUSIONS: This represents an extremely rare case of a patient with HL-like PTLD occurring as a primary central nervous system lesion.

AB BACKGROUND: Pheochromocytomas are uncommon neuroendocrine tumors of the adrenal medulla. Malignant behavior is seen in approximately 10% of these lesions, evidenced by distant metastasis to sites without chromaffin tissue. Here we report a rare case of intracranial epidural metastases of an adrenal pheochromocytoma in a 24-year-old man.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient originally presented at age 10 years with adrenal pheochromocytoma and subsequently developed extensive metastatic bone and lung disease. He was monitored in the intervening years until recent imaging demonstrated an enlarging right parietal mass. On surgical resection of the parietal lesion, the tumor was highly vascularized and confined to the epidural space.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of metastatic epidural spread of pheochromocytoma without concomitant subdural or intraparenchymal extension.

AB BACKGROUND: A rare complication following tracheotomy is common carotid artery (CCA) pseudoaneurysm. Treatment modalities for CCA pseudoaneurysm include surgical repair and single-artery balloon-covered stent graft technique. We describe successful treatment of tracheotomy-related CCA pseudoaneurysm with the "kissing balloon" expandable stent graft technique.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We successfully implemented the kissing balloon expandable stent graft technique for treatment of a large, narrow-necked, bilobed CCA pseudoaneurysm that arose owing to a tracheotomy complication. The pseudoaneurysm was detected while performing a diagnostic angiogram of the aortic arch and surrounding vessels. The stent was deployed while the 2 balloons were introduced in a kissing manner such that they faced one another to avoid occlusion of either branch of the innominate artery coming into contact; 1 balloon was inflated at the origin of the right subclavian artery, and the other was inflated at the right innominate artery simultaneously. The pseudoaneurysm was successfully contained; normal blood flow was restored in the CCA. The balloons were deflated and withdrawn. The patient remained neurologically intact after the procedure.
   CONCLUSIONS: The kissing balloon technique is a safe and effective alternative to surgical repair, as it prevents morbidities associated with the surgical procedure. Also, this technique decreases the risk of major side-branch occlusion associated with the single-artery balloon-covered stent graft technique.

AB More prehistoric trepanned crania have been found in Peru than any other location worldwide. We examine trepanation practices and outcomes in Peru over nearly 2000 years from 400 BC to provide a perspective on the procedure with comparison with procedures/outcomes of other ancient, medieval, and American Civil War cranial surgery. Data on trepanation demographics, techniques, and survival rates were collected through the scientific analysis of more than 800 trepanned crania discovered in Peru, through field studies and the courtesy of museums and private collections in the United States and Peru, over nearly 3 decades. Data on procedures and outcomes of cranial surgery ancient, medieval, and during 19th-century through the American Civil war were obtained via a literature review. Successful trepanations from prehistoric times through the American Civil War likely involved shallow surgeries that did not pierce the dura mater. Although there are regional and temporal variations in ancient Peru, overall long-term survival rates for the study series were about 40% in the earliest period (400-200 BC), with improvement to a high of 91% in samples from AD 1000-1400, to an average of 75%-83% during the Inca Period (AD 1400s-1500). In comparison, the average cranial surgery mortality rate during the American Civil war was 46%-56%, and short- and long-term survival rates are unknown. The contrast in outcomes highlights the astonishing success of ancient cranial surgery in Peru in the treatment of living patients.

   OPTIONS
AB BACKGROUND: Milrinone is an inotropic and vasodilatory drug proven safe for use in treatment of cerebral vasospasm. Despite its reported safety profile, its use is not free of side effects. Milrinone-associated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia can occur in patients with cerebral vasospasm.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This is a retrospective chart review of a patient who presented with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and developed clinical vasospasm twice over a period of 2 weeks. Sustained intravenous milrinone infusion was used in association with norepinephrine infusion during this period. The patient developed R-on-T triggered torsades de pointes and cardiogenic shock requiring resuscitation. Follow-up echocardiogram showed decreased ejection fraction from 64% to 43% consistent with cardiac remodeling. Systemic complications such as cardiotoxicity and arrhythmias with the use of intravenous milrinone can be seen particularly when used in combination with catecholamines.
   CONCLUSIONS: With increased combined milrinone and catecholamine use for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm, physicians should be aware of the potential cardiac complications of these agents. Close monitoring with daily electrocardiograms may be helpful to detect changes that suggest cardiotoxicity. If changes are noted, an echocardiogram and cardiology consultation may be warranted.

AB John C. VanGilder, the former professor and chairman of neurosurgery at The University of Iowa died on August 27, 2007 after making a lasting impact to the field of neurosurgery both in the United States and abroad. In this manuscript, we review VanGilder's life and achievements. VanGilder was born in 1935 in West Virginia and received his undergraduate education at West Virginia University in Morgantown. He studied medicine at the University of West Virginia, completing his final 2 years at the University of Pittsburgh, and after serving in the U.S. military, completed his neurosurgical training at Washington University in St. Louis. He was appointed to faculty positions first at Yale University and later at The University of Iowa, where he became professor and later chairman of the Division of Neurosurgery. VanGilder also served as president of the Society of Neurological Surgeons (1997-1998), president of the Neurosurgical Society of America (1998-1999), chairman of the American Board of Neurological Surgery (1997-1998), and vice president of the American Academy of Neurological Surgery. At The University of Iowa, VanGilder played a key role in the transition of the Division of Neurosurgery to a Department of Neurosurgery and mentored several neurosurgeons who would go on to become department chairmen or make other important neurosurgical contributions at other medical schools in the United States.

   FUSION; IMPROVEMENT; DISKECTOMY; EXCISION
AB OBJECTIVES: The schwannoma of the trochlear nerve is rare and originates mostly from the distal parts in the interpeduncular cistern. A lesion on the proximal segment in the inferior pineal region is extremely rare. Because of the rarity of the disease, the surgical approach to this region for the resection of trochlear nerve schwannoma has not been well documented in the literature. We herein describe a novel approach to successfully resect the trochlear nerve schwannoma.
   METHODS: A 12-year-old boy presented with occipital headache, abnormal gait, and disturbed conjoined eye movement. He was diagnosed with a lesion in the inferior pineal region compressing the superior medullary velum into the roof of the fourth ventricle. A bilateral midline suboccipital craniotomy was performed, and the fourth ventricle was exposed. The lesion was approached through the fourth ventricle superior medullary velum (transventricular transvelar approach). The lesion was totally resected, and his histopathology examination revealed trochlear schwannoma.
   RESULTS: The patient's symptoms resolved, and he had no recurrence at 12-year follow-up with normal eye movement and vision.
   CONCLUSION: The transventricular transvelar approach is feasible and safe to treat a lesion of the lower part of the pineal region being pushed through the superior medullary velum.

ID GANGLIONIC HAMARTOMA; PATHOGENESIS
AB BACKGROUND: Vestibular schwannomas and meningiomas account for the great majority of lesions arising in the cerebellopontine angle. In this report, we present a case of glioneuronal heterotopia, also known as glioneuronal hamartoma, arising from cranial nerve VIII, which is an extremely uncommon lesion. Important radiologic and surgical aspects are reviewed, which may help in early recognition and intraoperative decision making when these lesions are encountered.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A healthy 29-year-old female presented with intermittent right facial numbness. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an incidental, minimally enhancing cerebellopontine angle lesion on the right cranial nerve VII-VIII complex. The patient declined serial observation and opted for operative intervention for resection. Intraoperatively, the lesion resembled neural tissue and was continuous with the VIII cranial nerve. Pathologic analysis demonstrated mature glioneuronal tissue consistent with hamartomatous brain tissue. The patient maintained normal hearing and facial nerve function after surgery. Radiologic, surgical, and pathologic characteristics are described.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ectopic glioneuronal tissue of cranial nerve VIII is a rare non-neoplastic lesion and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unusual-appearing intracanalicular and cerebellopontine angle lesions. The congenital and benign nature of this entity makes observation a valid option for these cases, although they are so infrequent that they are often presumptively managed as vestibular schwannomas. Attempts to radically resect these lesions may result in higher rates of hearing loss or facial palsy due to their continuity with cranial nerves.

AB BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality worldwide and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring plays a crucial role in its management. Based on existing literature, we review the current practicing noninvasive ICP monitoring devices and their accuracy in predicting increased ICP in pediatric TBI.
   METHODS: A thorough literature search was conducted on PubMed, Medline, and the Cochrane database, articles were selected systematically and reviewed completely, and relevant data were summarized and discussed.
   RESULTS: A total of 27 articles pertaining to pediatric TBI were included and reviewed. We found various modalities of noninvasive ICP monitoring devices used over the last few years. The noninvasive modalities so far attempted in pediatric TBI and so reviewed here are transcranial Doppler, optic nerve sheath diameter, otoacoustic emission, near-infrared spectroscopy, contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, and quantitative pupillometry.
   CONCLUSIONS: Invasive monitoring methods are the current gold standard for monitoring ICP; however, complications caused by their invasive nature are of concern. Of all the noninvasive methods based on the literature, we found transcranial Doppler and optic nerve sheath diameter assessment to be the best tools to monitor ICP in pediatric TBI. The promising results and developments of noninvasive ICP monitoring modalities with its ideal features of high sensitivity, diagnostic accuracy, and simple acquisition technique may make it the future of neurointensive monitoring in pediatric TBI.

TI Rare Event Captured with Intracranial Pressure Monitor: Malignant Spike
   in Intracranial Pressure During Delayed Chest Closure in
   Heart-Transplant Patient with Ischemic Stroke
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Chest wound closure; Heart transplant; ICP monitor; Intracranial
   pressure; Malignant cerebral edema; Sternal closure ischemic stroke
ID NEUROLOGIC COMPLICATIONS; STERNAL CLOSURE
AB BACKGROUND: Patients with open chest wounds, either related to trauma or cardiothoracic procedures, are subjected to significant physiologic alterations when undergoing chest wound closure. Sudden increased intrathoracic pressure at closure decreases venous return from the brain to the heart; consequently the total blood volume in the ridged skull increases, resulting in increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Patients with intact cerebrovascular autoregulation can compensate for these sudden changes by adjusting cerebral blood flow to maintain physiologic ICP. In cases where the autoregulatory mechanisms are compromised, such as stroke or trauma, the ICP can become pathologically elevated. If the patient does not have an ICP monitor, the spike in ICP can go unrecognized, compromising cerebral perfusion pressure and resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Herein we describe a case of pathologic elevations in ICP captured with an ICP monitor at the time of chest wound closure in a patient with delayed chest wound closure after orthotopic heart transplant and comorbid embolic stroke.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case report demonstrates the potential utility of ICP monitoring in patients with impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation with open and manipulated chest wounds from transplant or trauma.

   ANEURYSMS; EXPERIENCE; OUTCOMES; COMPLEX
AB OBJECTIVE: Neck clipping remains a valuable treatment option for basilar apex aneurysms, especially in those with complex morphology, such as incorporation of branching vessels or large size, and young patient age. Several approaches have proved to give effective exposure for various types of lesion morphologies. Our historic literature review from 1976 to the present systematically compares the outcomes and complications of the key surgical approaches in the treatment of basilar apex aneurysms.
   METHODS: We searched PubMed for articles with at least 5 patients, data on neurologic outcome, and procedure-associated complications for the following approaches: pterional or orbitozygomatic transsylvian, subtemporal (with or without zygomatic osteotomy), pretemporal (with or without transcavernous extension), and transpetrous. n-Weighted averages for clinical outcome, aneurysm occlusion rates, morbidity, mortality, and aneurysm morphology were compared.
   RESULTS: Of 35 articles selected, 2041 patients with 722 ruptured aneurysms underwent microsurgery, including 1131 transsylvian, 241 pretemporal, 375 subtemporal, and 17 transpetrous approaches. Comparing these 4 approaches in n-weighted averages, respectively, we noted good neurologic outcomes (81%, 85%, 81%, and 58%), surgical morbidity (14%, 10%, 34%, and 53%), surgical mortality (4%, 1%, 0, and 1%), and complete occlusion rates (95%, 94%, 86%, and 75%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Transsylvian, pretemporal, and subtemporal approaches showed favorable neurologic outcomes at similar rates and were applied for aneurysms located between -1mm and +7mm in relation to the posterior clinoid process. The pretemporal approach was preferably applied to large and giant aneurysms with good outcome; the transsylvian approach was most frequently used for ruptured aneurysms.

ID OTOGENIC INTRACEREBRAL PNEUMOCEPHALUS; PNEUMATOCELE
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial pneumocephalus is a well-known clinical entity most frequently caused by trauma and intracranial surgery. A less frequent cause of intracranial pneumocephalus is spontaneous pneumocephalus. Spontaneous pneumocephalus can have an intraventricular extension, causing tension intraventricular pneumocephalus.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present an exceptionally rare case of spontaneous otogenic intraventricular pneumocephalus in a 58-year-old female that resulted in a decline in mentation and neurologic deficit. The patient was subsequently treated with ventriculostomy and middle fossa craniotomy, with repair of a bony defect and dural closure.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates an unusual presentation of spontaneous intraventricular tension pneumocephalus necessitating ventriculostomy in addition to the traditional repair of a cerebrospinal fluid fistula.

AB BACKGROUND: Anterior sacral meningocele (ASM) leading to secondary rectothecal fistula is extremely rare, and to date only 5 such cases have been described in the world literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe an uncomplicated case of a 52-year-old female patient presenting with cerebrospinal fluid leak from the anus who was investigated and found to have an ASM with rectothecal fistula. The ASM and rectothecal fistula were subsequently repaired using a posterior approach. Pertinent literature review, clinical findings, neuroimaging, and surgical management are described for these rare lesions.
   CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis and surgical disconnection of the fistulous tract led to satisfactory outcome in the present case and avoided the catastrophic complication of meningitis.

   COWDEN-SYNDROME; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; APPEARANCE; HAMARTOMA; PATIENT; PTEN
AB BACKGROUND: Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD) is a rare neurologic disease that causes a hamartomatous lesion in the cerebellum. LDD is usually associated with mass lesion effects, but with appropriate surgical treatment, the clinical course is usually benign. We report a rare case of a patient with LDD with contrast enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) who died as a result of intratumoral hemorrhage.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: LDD was diagnosed in a 59-year-old woman after a routine MRI. She did not present with any symptoms initially or after follow-up MRI suggested minor hemorrhage in the tumor. Eleven months after her first visit to our department, she suddenly lost consciousness, and computed tomography revealed massive intratumoral hemorrhage. Surgical decompression was done, but she died 17 days after surgery. Histopathologic findings were consistent with LDD.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hemorrhagic events can occur with LDD, even though the growth of the lesion is slow. Long-term close follow-up of patients with LDD is needed, especially patients in whom MRI shows atypical enhancement. To avoid possible hemorrhagic events, surgical treatment should be considered even if only subtle changes are seen on neuroimaging.

ID CERVICAL-SPINE; ROTATORY SUBLUXATION; INJURIES
AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to document our experience in managing a rare complex of traumatic posterolateral atlantoaxial dislocation combined with locked lateral mass and type II odontoid fracture.
   METHOD: A 30-year-old male patient was referred to the author's department. He complained of a decrease in neck range of motion following a traffic accident. Neurologic examination was normal. Computed tomography and open-mouth radiographs showed a type II odontoid fracture and a posterolateral dislocation with a laterally locked left lateral mass at the C1-C2 level. Considering the difficulty and risk in reduction, due to this rare instability and dislocation, a 2-staged treatment was performed. With up to 11 kg skull traction for 7 days before surgery, the locked lateral mass and the lateral dislocation was finally reduced without any neurologic deficit. And once closed reduction was confirmed by open-mouth and lateral X-ray views in the cervical spine, a second staged C1-C2 surgical fixation and fusion with iliac bone graft was performed to achieve a normal anatomic alignment with a better stability.
   RESULT: The patient showed significant amelioration of neck symptoms postoperatively, and a successful reduction and fixation of the C1-C2 articulation was achieved. At the 5-year follow-up, solid bone fusion was evident on the computed tomography scan.
   CONCLUSION: For traumatic posterolateral atlantoaxial dislocation complicated with type II odontoid fracture, a closed reduction of the lateral dislocation before operation is both useful and safe because surgeons do not need to reduce the extremely rare lateral dislocation during the operation. Posterior atlantoaxial stabilization and fusion, rather than the occipitocervical fusion as reported previously, is biomechanically stable enough to achieve solid fusion in this rare trauma while not sacrificing the occipitoatlantal joint.

   ischemic optic neuropathy; Visual loss
ID PERIOPERATIVE VISUAL-LOSS; OF-THE-LITERATURE; SPINE SURGERY; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Postoperative posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (PION) is a rare cause of postoperative vision loss, most often seen when surgical patients are placed in the prone position for a prolonged period of time. We report a case of bilateral PION after far-lateral craniectomy in the lateral position.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 36-year-old man presented with a history of right extremity numbness, weakness, and muscle atrophy, and a craniocervical meningioma was diagnosed. Surgery in the lateral position lasted 9 hours, 52 minutes; the patient had 2 L of blood loss. On postoperative day 1, the patient had bilateral vision loss, which prompted further work-up. Diffusion-weighted imaging of the orbits demonstrated restricted diffusion within the bilateral optic nerves. The clinical presentation of painless vision loss after surgery with these imaging findings led to a diagnosis of PION. At the time of discharge, he had not recovered any visual function.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that PION can occur in the lateral position where there is no direct pressure on the orbits. PION is often not discussed as a potential complication during the preoperative consent process. This case suggests it may be prudent to discuss PION in similar neurosurgical cases. Intraoperative blood transfusion should be considered in prolonged surgeries in the lateral position, where slow blood loss over a long period could be a contributing factor to development of PION.

AB BACKGROUND: Meningioma is a common slow-growing spinal tumor with a predilection for intradural occurrence. Patients usually present with pain followed by ataxia and sensory and sphincter problems. The gold standard treatment in these cases is gross total microsurgical resection under general anesthesia. However, there exist high-anesthetic-risk patients unsuitable for general anesthesia. Performing spinal surgeries under local anesthesia and sedation has been reported, albeit rarely for mostly minimally invasive procedures but not for open intradural pathologies.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a 63-year-old woman with critical aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, and severe chronic obstructive airways disease who presented with 10 months' history of worsening back pain and bilateral leg pain, ataxia, hyperreflexia in lower limbs, as well as altered lower limb sensation. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a contrast-enhancing intradural lesion at T6/7 with severe spinal cord compression. However, the patient was American Society of Anesthesiologists class IV and her cardiac disease was not amenable to intervention. She underwent thoracic laminectomy and excision of the tumor under local anesthesia and sedation with no significant complications and clinical improvement.
   CONCLUSION: Our illustrative case and literature review suggest that using local anesthesia and sedation to perform spinal surgeries including intradural tumors is possible even in high-risk patients with good outcome. Our American Society of Anesthesiologists class IV patient tolerated the surgery well with gross total tumor resection and subsequent resolution of the symptoms.

   Ventriculoatrial shunt malfunction
AB BACKGROUND: Ventriculoatrial shunts are common alternatives for patients who cannot tolerate ventriculoperitoneal shunts. The majority of ventriculoatrial shunt malfunctions are related to mechanical problems. We report an interesting case of ventriculoatrial shunt malfunction due to elevated central venous pressure from new-onset atrial fibrillation.
   METHODS: After the patient was confirmed to have ventriculomegaly, he was taken to the operating room for exploration of his ventriculoatrial shunt; there were no obstructions. Subsequently, the patient was cardioverted to normal sinus rhythm for his new onset atrial fibrillation.
   RESULTS: The clinical syndrome and ventriculomegaly both resolved after the patient's atrial fibrillation was corrected with chemical cardioversion.
   CONCLUSIONS: The cause of this patient's VA shunt malfunction was likely associated with his new onset atrial fibrillation.

TI Tuberculous Spondylolisthesis: A Reappraisal of the Clinicoradiologic
   Spectrum and Surgical Treatment Paradigm

AB INTRODUCTION: Spinal tuberculosis (TB) is a common infectious disease prevalent in developing countries and an increasing issue in developed countries. The association of tuberculosis with spondylolisthesis is rarely reported in literature. The aim of our review is to analyze the clinical features and radiologic characteristics of TB spondylolisthesis and to provide a concise update on its surgical management, based on the literature.
   METHODS: A systematic review was performed after conducting a thorough search of the PubMed database. Articles were selected systematically and reviewed completely and relevant data were summarized and discussed.
   RESULTS: Nineteen articles were selected for the review. The most common clinical manifestation was focal back pain, followed by motor deficit. Most patients had grade 2 listhesis and associated tubercular abscess. The anterior as well as the posterior surgical approach have their own advantages and the choice of approach depends on the location of disease, ease of access, achievement of spinal stability, and avoidance of spread of contiguous infection. Although a posterior approach and fixation using pedicular screws and rods along with debridement of pus or granulation tissue is the favored approach in dorsolumbar TB, an anterior approach, corpectomy, and fusion are preferred in cervical TB.
   CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of TB spondylolisthesis encompasses a wide spectrum of surgical options. However, the mainstay of treatment is chemotherapy. The indications for which surgical management may have an upper hand over medical management are spinal cord compression, significant instability, large tubercular abscess, painful vertebral lesions, kyphosis, and infection by multidrug-resistant TB or extreme drug-resistant TB, when medical management alone does not help. Surgery is effective in these situations by achieving radical debridement, permanent stability, prevention of further neurologic deterioration, and early recovery. Even although conservative management may help in certain cases, a posterior approach, decompression, and fusion are preferred for unstable dorsolumbar disease, whereas an anterior approach is preferred for cervical disease. Combined approaches can be considered in pediatric spinal TB for the correction of kyphotic deformity and its consequent maintenance.

AB OBJECTIVE: In recent years, delivery of cost-effective "essential neurosurgery" in resource-limited communities has been recognized as an indispensable part of health care and a global health priority. The aim of this study was to review outcomes from operative management of spine trauma at a resource-limited government hospital in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and to provide an epidemiologic report to guide prevention programs.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospective neurosurgical database was performed to identify risk factors for spine trauma and severe spinal cord injury (American Spinal Injury Association A or American Spinal Injury Association B) and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of surgery for patients treated at Preah Kossamak Hospital for subaxial and thoracolumbar spine trauma from 2013 to 2016.
   RESULTS: Surgical treatment was provided to 277 patients with cervical or thoracolumbar spine trauma, including 36 facet dislocations and 135 thoracolumbar burst fractures at a cost of $100-$280 per surgery. Six patients (2.2%) required treatment for postoperative wound infection. Reoperation was performed in 8 patients (2.9%) for wrong-level surgery. Failure of short-segment pedicle screw fixation was discovered in 4 patients (7.0%). Neurologic improvement was reported by 64 patients (65.3%) with incomplete spinal cord injury and available long-term follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Affordable neurosurgical care can be provided in a safe and sustainable manner to patients with traumatic spine and spinal cord injuries in resource-limited communities. This supports the call for essential neurosurgery to be made available around the world to individuals from all socioeconomic strata.

AB BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) techniques have emerged as viable and safe alternatives for lumbar disc herniation, including percutaneous discectomy, percutaneous endoscopic discectomy, and tubulardiscectomy (TD). We present here a systematic review and a multiple-treatment meta-analysis evaluating the operative outcomes and patient-reported outcomes of open/microdiscectomy (OD/MD) and all MIS approaches for lumbar disc herniation.
   METHODS: The PICO approach and PRISMA (i.e., Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed to query existing online databases since their inception to 2016, which yielded 14 studies after we applied the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials was used to assess the risk of bias in each study was used to assess the risk of bias in each study. Each outcome was assessed across all studies with the GRADE (i.e., Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) criteria.
   RESULTS: There were 1707 patients analyzed, with 782 (45.81%) undergoing OD/MD, 491 (28.76%) undergoing TD, 199 (11.65%) undergoing percutaneous endoscopic discectomy, and 235 (13.76%) patients undergoing percutaneous discectomy. TD was found to be associated with significantly worse Oswestry Disability Index scores (mean difference 1.17, P = 0.03) whereas OD/MD was associated with worse Oswestry Disability Index scores compared with all other approaches (mean difference 2.61, P = 0.03), significantly longer duration of stay (mean difference 2.96, P = 0.04), and more blood loss (mean difference 30.53, P < 0.001). In terms of complications, TD was found to be associated with a greater rate of overall complications (odds ratio [OR] 1.49, P = 0.002), greater incidence of dural tears (OR 1.72 P = 0.04), and recurrent herniation (OR 2.09, P = 0.0007). Finally, OD/MD was associated with significantly lower incidence of revision surgery (OR 0.53, P = 0.0007).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis revealed that tubular-discectomy and percutaneous-endoscopic-discectomy, the most commonly employed MIS techniques for discectomy, can be used as safe alternatives for open discectomy depending on the preference of the operating surgeon.

AB BACKGROUND: The incidence of primary spinal cord melanoma (PSCM) is rare. Several case series and case reports have been published in the literature. However, the predictive factors of PSCM survival and management options are not discussed in detail.
   METHODS: We present a case of PSCM; total resection was achieved and chemotherapy was given post-operatively. A comprehensive search was performed on PubMed's electronic database using the words "primary spinal cord melanoma." Survival rates with various gender, location, treatment, and metastasis condition were collected from the published articles and analyzed.
   RESULTS: Fifty nine cases were eligible for the survival analysis; 54% were male and 46% were female. Patient sex did not influence overall survival. The most common location was the thorax. Patient sex and tumor location did not influence overall survival. The major presenting symptoms were weakness and paresthesia of the extremities. Metastasis or dissemination was noted in 45.16% of 31 patients. In the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, patients who had metastasis had the worst prognosis. Extent of resection was not related to mortality. Patients who received surgery and surgery with adjuvant therapy had a better median survival than did those who had adjuvant therapy alone. Prognosis was worst in those patients who underwent only adjuvant therapy without surgery (5 months).
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgery is the first treatment of choice in treating PSCM. The goal of tumor resection is to reduce symptoms. Adjuvant therapy after surgery had a beneficial effect on limiting the metastasis.

TI Circle of Willis Collateral Flow in Carotid Artery Occlusion Is Depicted

AB BACKGROUND: In case of carotid artery occlusion, the risk and extent of ischemic cerebral damage are highly dependent on the pathways of collateral flow including the anatomy of the circle of Willis. In this report, cases are presented to illustrate that 4-dimensional computed tomography angiography (4D-CTA) can be considered as a noninvasive alternative to digital subtraction angiography for the evaluation of circle of Willis collateral flow.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Five patients with unilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion underwent 4D-CTA for the evaluation of intracranial hemodynamics. Next to a visual evaluation of 4D-CTA, temporal information was visualized using a normalized color scale on the cerebral vasculature, which enabled quantification of the contrast bolus arrival time. In these patients, 4D-CTA demonstrated dominant middle cerebral artery blood supply on the side of ICA occlusion originating from either the contralateral ICA or posterior circulation via the communicating arteries.
   CONCLUSIONS: Temporal dynamics of collateral flow in the circle of Willis can be depicted with 4D-CTA in patients with a unilateral carotid artery occlusion.

AB BACKGROUND: Limited information is available on the natural history and etiology of cystic formation after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases (BM). We aimed to characterize the natural history of cyst formation after SRS of BM and analyze potential risk factors.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 214 consecutive patients who underwent a total of 1106 SRSs for BM. Demographic, clinical, dosimetric, and magnetic resonance imaging MRI data were reviewed. Statistical analysis was accomplished using Student's t test, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression.
   RESULTS: The median patient age was 61 years (range, 19-91 years), and the median duration of follow-up was 424 days (range, 91-2934 days). Eleven cases of cyst formation (0.9% of 1106 treated lesions) were identified at SRS-treated BM sites among 9 patients (2 patients developed cysts at independent sites). The median interval between first SRS and first evidence of cyst was 218 days. Seven of the 9 patients (78%) sustained progressive cyst expansion and neurologic decline requiring steroid treatment. Four of these 7 patients (57%) experienced continued neurologic decline and needed surgical fenestration. On univariate analysis, receipt of >4 rounds of SRS was the sole variable associated with an increased risk of cyst formation (odds ratio, 16.58; P = 0.001). This association remained robust after adjusting for duration of follow-up (odds ratio, 13.59; P = 0.003).
   CONCLUSIONS: In our experience with 1106 SRS-treated cases of BM, cyst formation was a rare phenomenon. However, 1 in 3 patients who underwent >4 rounds of SRS sustained cyst formation. A high proportion (78%) of SRS-associated cysts progressively expanded and required medical or surgical treatment.

ID RADICULOPATHY
AB OBJECTIVE: Cases presenting contralateral radicular symptoms are rarely encountered. It is difficult to decide on the correct side in cases where surgical intervention will be performed. The aim of the study is to explain the symptomatology in cases of lumbar disc herniations causing contralateral radicular symptoms by a hypotenusal effect.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 27 cases were included in the study. Eight cases underwent surgical interventions performed on the side where disc herniation was radiologically detected. Nineteen cases were treated conservatively. Disc herniations were radiologically evaluated in 3 different groups, and the effect on the root on the symptomatic side was explained by a hypotenusal theory. Correlations among symptomatology, clinical findings, magnetic resonance imaging, and electromyography were discussed.
   RESULTS: Clinical improvement was observed in all cases that were operated on the side where disc herniation was detected radiologically. Neurologic examination findings in the postoperative period also revealed the correctness of the selected surgical approach. Electromyography is insufficient to explain clinical findings and to decide on the surgical side.
   CONCLUSION: Lumbar disc herniations, which lead to contralateral radicular symptoms, should be operated from the side where the disc is radiologically detected. The top of the disc is responsible for symptomatology. Surgical excision of the top of the disc removes the contralateral root traction and root compression on the same side.

AB OBJECTIVE: Although approaches to the fourth ventricle (FV) have been studied well, approaches to the lesions located in the dorsal and lateral aspects of the FV have not been shown in anatomic or clinical studies. The aim of this study is to show for the first time in the literature the tonsillouvular fissure approach (TUFA) in anatomic dissections and its use in surgical series.
   METHODS: For anatomic studies, 4 formalin-fixed human cadaveric heads infused with colored silicone and 10 cerebellar specimens were dissected in a stepwise manner. Records of 12 patients operated on via TUFA were also retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS: Neurosurgical anatomy and critical steps of TUFA were described in detail. Among 12 patients with lesions around the FV (4 cavernous malformation, 2 pilocytic astrocytoma, 2 hemangioblastoma, 1 B-cell lymphoma, 1 metastatic papillary carcinoma, 1 dermoid cyst, and 1 arteriovenous malformation), 11 gross total and 1 subtotal resection were achieved via TUFA without any mortality or morbidity. Comparative analyses of 4 surgical approaches to FV (TUFA, telovelar/cerebellomedullary fissure, supratonsillar/tonsillobiventral lobule fissure, and transvermian approaches) were also presented.
   CONCLUSIONS: TUFA provides a direct route and excellent surgical view to lesions around the FV, particularly on dorsal and lateral aspects, inferior vermis, and medial part of the dentate nucleus and cerebellar peduncles. It minimizes traversing the normal cerebellar tissue compared with a transvermian approach.

AB BACKGROUND: Approximately 10%-13% of the population is left-handed (LH), and certain professions have varied representation of LH individuals. LH surgeons must overcome unique difficulties owing to the right-handed (RH) operative environment. This study assesses prevalence and impact of left-handedness on training and operative experience of neurosurgeons.
   METHODS: An e-mail survey was designed and sent to 5109 U.S. neurosurgeons and neurosurgical trainees. The survey was completed by 1482 responders (29.0% response rate).
   RESULTS: Of respondents, 252 (17.0%) reported being LH. LH neurosurgeons were more likely than RH neurosurgeons to report ambidexterity in the operating room (36.5% vs. 13.3%, P < 0.001). During neurosurgical training, 23.5% of RH trainers addressed LH-specific issues compared with 44.7% of LH trainers. LH trainers were more likely to describe LH trainees as having greater technical ability (18.9%). Most trainers reported equal comfort teaching LH and RH trainees. LH trainees reported difficulties with RH surgical tools (42.7%) and a tendency to alter handedness for surgery (62.7%). The impact of these areas lessens in LH attendings (27.8% and 39.9%, respectively). Most LH neurosurgeons denied specific training for left-handedness and access to LH-specific tools, and 24.0% of LH trainees reported feeling disadvantaged owing to their handedness.
   CONCLUSIONS: LH neurosurgeons may be over-represented in neurosurgery, yet handedness is rarely addressed in neurosurgical training. Despite this, there is evidence of some degree of adaptation through training. There may be some benefit from recognizing differences in handedness in the operating room and attempting to give access for LH-specific mentorship during training.

AB OBJECTIVE: To conduct meta-regression for the identification of clinically meaningful characteristics that can predict successful treatment of intracranial aneurysms with the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED).
   METHODS: Using the key word "Pipeline Embolization Device" and prespecified eligibility criteria, we searched PubMed and EMBASE and identified 105 original research articles (10,813 patients) published or in press (April 6, 2011, to December 31, 2016) focused on safety and/or effectiveness of PED. We constructed meta-regression models to identify predictors of 3 measures of PED treatment success, specifically rates of aneurysm occlusion, modified Rankin Scale score, and death. Rates were log(e)-transformed, and the adjusted R-2 statistic was reported for each model.
   RESULTS: Aneurysm morphology and type accounted for substantial variation in 1-year aneurysm occlusion rate (14 studies with 689 patients; R-adj(2) = 88.91%). By contrast, predictors of 6-months aneurysm occlusion rate (aneurysm location, aneurysm type; 24 studies with 1321 patients; R-adj(2) = 31.67%) and aneurysm occlusion rate at unspecified follow-up time (year of publication, mean duration of angiographic follow-up; 34 studies with 1663 patients, R-adj(2) = 42.82%) accounted for less variability. Few predictors were identified for death rate (number of patients, aneurysm morphology; 34 studies with 6463 patients, R-adj(2) = 50.69%) or modified Rankin Scale score <= 2 (year of publication, mean age, aneurysm morphology; 14 studies with 556 patients, R-adj(2) = 100%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Few clinically meaningful characteristics appear to be relevant as predictors of the selected measures of PED treatment success. Future studies should attempt to identify additional predictors while focusing on aneurysm morphology as a key predictor of PED outcomes.

DE Life expectancy; Mortality; Neurosurgeon; Psychological stress
ID GENERAL-PRACTITIONERS; HOSPITAL CONSULTANTS; MORTALITY; PHYSICIANS;
   DOCTORS; HEALTH
AB BACKGROUND: Life expectancy (LE) refers to the number of years that an individual is expected to survive. Emphasis is frequently placed on the relationship between LE and the conditions under which a population lives, but fewer studies have investigated the relationship between stress factors associated with specific professions and their effects on LE. The aim of this study is to evaluate Brazilian neurosurgeons' life expectancies (BNLEs) and compare them with those of physicians (both Brazilian and foreign) from other fields, as well as with Brazilian nondoctors.
   METHODS: The Brazilian Society of Neurosurgery death registry was used to obtain data that compared LEs from non-neurosurgeon physicians, as described in the national and international literature. BNLEs were also compared with the LEs of Brazilian citizens.
   RESULTS: Fifty-one neurosurgeons died between 2009 and 2016. All were males. The mean age at death was 68.31 +/- 17.71 years. Among all-cause mortality, the breakdown was 20% cardiovascular diseases, 39% malignancies, 10% external factors, 6% gastrointestinal disorders, 12% neurologic illnesses, and 14% unknown causes. BNLE was shorter than LE of male Brazilian citizens.
   CONCLUSIONS: LE was similar among neurosurgeons and other doctors but shorter compared with Brazilian citizens. Further research is needed to provide data that can add to and confirm these results.

   dislocation; Subaxial cervical fracture; Subaxial cervical injury
ID DISLOCATION INJURIES; SPINE; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Dislocations to cervical facets resulting from traumatic injury often lead to neurologic impairment and can be treated both surgically and in a closed manner.
   OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the utilization of closed reduction in the initial management of bilateral facet dislocations over the past 10 years at our institution.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients who experienced subaxial cervical facet injury within the Penn Health System between 1 June 2006 and 1 June 2016 to identify patients with bilateral jumped/perched facets. The neurologic injury was identified on the basis of the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) spinal cord injury score. Analysis of variance and 2-sample t-tests were used to compare continuous distributions, and chi-square tests were used to compare categorical distributions.
   RESULTS: We focused our analyses on patients who presented with bilateral jumped/perched facets with (ASIA A and B) or without (ASIA C, D, E) complete voluntary motor deficit and underwent attempted closed reduction. We found that the rate of successful closed reduction was significantly higher in incomplete motor deficits (5/5, P = 0.04, chi-square test) as compared with complete motor deficits (n = 2/11).
   CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate a significant difference in the success rate of closed reduction in patients with good neurologic status on presentation (ASIA A or B), compared with those with poor neurologic status (ASIA C, D, and E). These results suggest that closed reduction should be attempted in patients with good motor examinations on presentation, whereas those with significant deficits may benefit from earlier surgical intervention.

AB BACKGROUND: Understanding risk factors for intracranial aneurysm growth is important for patient management. We performed a retrospective study examining risk factors for the growth of unruptured intracranial aneurysms followed at our institution, evaluating both traditional risk factors and the PHASES (Population, Hypertension, Age, Size, Earlier Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, Site) score.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a consecutive series of unruptured intracranial aneurysms followed at our institution for minimum of 6 months over a 15-year period. The primary outcome of this study was aneurysm growth, defined as a >= 1-mm increase in maximum diameter. Risk factors studied included PHASES score, ELAPSS (Earlier Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, Location of Aneurysm, Age, Population, Size, and Shape) score, demographics, multiple aneurysms, previous subarachnoid hemorrhage, family history of aneurysm or subarachnoid hemorrhage, smoking, hypertension, and aneurysm shape, size, and location. The chi(2) test was used for comparison of categorical variables, and the Student t test was used for continuous variables.
   RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 352 patients with a total of 431 unruptured intracranial aneurysms. The mean duration of follow-up was 4.8 years, and there was a total of 2100 aneurysm-years of follow-up. Forty aneurysms (9.3%) grew, for an annualized growth rate of 2.0% of aneurysms/year. Current smoking status was the sole modifiable risk factor associated with growth (growth rate of 5.1%/year compared with 1.5%/year for never smokers; P = 0.0004). Increasing size (odds ratio [On 1.22; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 1.11-1.33; P < 0.0001), ELAPSS score (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.09-111; P < 0.0001), and PHASES score (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.20-1.28; P < 0.0001) were associated with growth as well. Age, location, previous subarachnoid hemorrhage: and hypertension were not independently associated with aneurysm growth.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our retrospective study suggests that aneurysm size, smoking status, PHASES score, and ELAPSS score are associated with aneurysm growth.

AB BACKGROUND: Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoina (PXA) is a very rare glial neoplasm. The clinical behavior of PXA is not uniform, and the purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of adult PXA and identify prognostic factors.
   METHODS: Twenty-five patients aged 18 years or older who were diagnosed with PXA between 2002 and 2016 were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (84%) had PXA World Health Organization (WHO) grade II and 4 patients (16%) had anaplastic PXA (WHO grade III). The median overall survival of PXA WHO grade 11 and IV was 97 and 56 months, respectively. The 3-year progression-free survival of PXA WHO grade II and HI was 65.1% and 50%, respectively (P = 0.37 and 0.21). Diffusion-weighted imaging, perfusion-weighted imaging, and positron emission tomography findings failed to predict the histologic grade of PXA and recurrence of PXA WHO grade II. Tumor size >40 mm and presence of evident peritumoral edema (ePTE) were prognostic factors for poor progression free survival (hazard ratios, 4.4 and 15.2, respectively; P = 0.03 and 0.01) according to a univariate analysis. In the recurrent and silent PXA grade II groups, ePTE was present in 87.5% and 23.1% of cases, respectively (P <0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: The clinical and radiologic features of PXA are not uniform, Tumor size and ePTE are possible prognostic factors for adult PXA. Also, peritumoral edema may be associated with recurrence in PXA WHO grade II. PXA showed a high recurrence rate, and thus close follow-up is needed.

AB OBJECTIVE: The pathophysiology of spinal cord injury (SCI) with the information obtained to date has not been elucidated fully. A safe drug or treatment protocol that results in cell regeneration for SCI remains unknown. Neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects of riluzole, administered after a SCI, have been shown in experimental studies. This study aimed to investigate the effect of riluzole on neural regeneration in a rat SCI model.
   METHODS: Thirty-two rats were divided into 8 groups, with 4 rats in each group. Hemisection method was performed after T7-T9 laminectomy. Rats were intraperitoneally aministered with riluzole (6 mg/kg). Locomotor recovery of the rats was assessed at 1 day, and 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks after the 21-point Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan test. Subsequently, the spinal cords of the rats were scored according to a semiquantitative grading system using a light microscope, and the numbers of myelinated axons, neurons, and glial cells were calculated.
   RESULTS: Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan test changes were statistically significant when groups 4e6 and 8 were compared with the other groups (P < 0.05, P < 0.00625). The results of the numbers of neurons, glial cells, and myelinated axons were statistically significant. Especially group 8, in which riluzole was administered 5 days before injury, more positive clinical and histopathologic results were obtained.
   CONCLUSIONS: Riluzole treatment is more effective when provided before injury. Riluzole may contribute to functional recovery when used in the preoperative period in patients who are at a high risk for permanent neurologic deficit.

Patients with small-to medium-sized sporadic vestibular schwannoma who underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS; n = 247), microsurgery (n = 144), or observation (n = 148) between 1998 and 2008 were surveyed regarding their motivation behind treatment selection and hindsight satisfaction with their choice of management.
   RESULTS: "Physician recommendation" was the most commonly stated reason for modality selection in all 3 groups. The second and third most common reasons for selecting SRS included "less invasive option than surgery" in 80 patients (32%) and "less recovery time than surgery" in 16 patients (6%). The second and third most common reasons for selecting observation included "to avoid side-effects of treatment" in 25 patients (17%) and "symptoms not severe enough to warrant intervention" in 22 patients (15%). The second and third most common reasons for selecting microsurgery included "do not want tumor in head" in 35 patients (24%) and "most definitive treatment" in 15 patients (10%). Overall, 232 patients (96%) treated with SRS, 141 observed patients (97%), and 121 patients (85%) who underwent microsurgical treatment were satisfied with their original decision (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Motivation behind treatment selection varies between individuals. Those who select observation and SRS commonly reference less invasiveness and lower risk, whereas those who select microsurgery are commonly motivated by having their tumor physically removed and the more definitive nature of treatment. Posttreatment satisfaction is highest in patients who undergo SRS and observation, although all 3 groups report high levels of satisfaction.

DE Hormone-dependent tumor; Meningioma; Pregnancy; Shrinkage; Vanishing
ID CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; RISK; PROGESTERONE
AB BACKGROUND: Meningiomas are common intracranial neoplasms of undetermined etiology. Accelerated growth during episodes of elevated serum estrogen and progesterone have been demonstrated in pregnant patients, as exhibited by an overexpression of estrogen or progesterone on immunohistochemical analysis. This case report and literature review describe a case of complete meningioma regression in a postpartum patient.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 23-year-old female presented at 37 weeks of pregnancy with 1-month history of fluctuating severe left-sided headaches, periodic blurry vision, nausea, and vomiting. She had 2 previous pregnancies without complication. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a duralbased, heterogeneously enhancing mass along the left tentorium, just posterior to the transverse sinus, with supratentorial extension and surrounding edema. Differential diagnoses included meningioma versus hemangioma versus hemangiopericytoma. The patient followed up with neurosurgery 1 month after delivery. She had continued left-sided headaches but no longer complained of visual changes. A postpartum surgical resection via left occipital and suboccipital craniotomy was planned. Approximately 1 month later (now about 3 months after delivery) a repeat magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a marked decrease in meningioma size, and the previously seen edema had resolved. In light of the sudden disappearance of the meningioma, no further surgical intervention was pursued.
   CONCLUSIONS: Because meningioma shrinkage or disappearance may occur after pregnancy, repeat imaging is advised as part of a preoperative evaluation. In addition, it is possible that an undetermined amount of meningioma removal surgeries may be avoided with further research into monitoring hormone levels connected to meningioma growth.

TI A Novel Knotless Barbed Suture Technique for Traumatic Thoracolumbar
   Fracture in Posterior Surgery
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

   closure
ID WOUND CLOSURE; IN-VIVO; MONOFILAMENT; DEVICE; REPAIR; COST
AB BACKGROUND: Surgical wound closure directly influences spinal surgical efficiency and several postoperative complications. The traditional suture technique is time-consuming and associated with greater rates of complications. Bidirectional absorbable barbed sutures seem to compensate for some of the limitations of traditional suture; however, they rarely are reported in spinal surgery. We designed a novel suture technique for use in thoracolumbar spinal surgery.
   METHODS: The data of 189 patients with traumatic thoracolumbar fractures were analyzed between bidirectional barbed suture closure and traditional interrupted suture closure. Data of operative time, wound closure time, length of incision, intraoperative blood loss, complications of wound dehiscence and postoperative hematoma, cost, and neurologic status were collected.
   RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in the baseline demographics of included patients. Compared with the traditional suturing group, the barbed sutures decreased the mean operative time (P = 0.037), suture time (P < 0.01), and mean suturing time (P < 0.01) significantly, although no statistically significant differences were found in blood loss (P = 0.724) and neurologic functional scores (preoperative: P = 0.901; 3 months after surgery: P = 0.208; final follow-up assessments: P = 0.163), and no statistically significant differences were found in rates of postoperative infection, hematoma, and wound dehiscence.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the novel knotless barbed suture has comparable strength to traditional sutures, with the advantage of less suturing time. It is an efficient, safe technique, and alternative choice for patients with thoracolumbar fracture after posterior surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: Giant wide-neck paraclinoid aneurysms remain a formidable challenge for neurosurgeons due to the brisk retrograde blood flow during surgical clipping. Theoretically, Entire orifice blockade (EOB) by placing a longitudinal intracarotid balloon catheter across the aneurysm neck could achieve a good vascular control in treating cerebral aneurysms, but related studies have been scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficiency of the EOB-assisted microsurgical technique for treating giant wide-neck paraclinoid aneurysms.
   METHODS: Clinical data and treatment summaries of patients with giant wide-neck paraclinoid aneurysms who underwent EOB-assisted microsurgical clipping were retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS: A total of 26 patients were analyzed. All but 3 patients harbored unruptured aneurysms. The mean largest diameter of the aneurysms was 26.8 +/- 2.0 mm, and the mean neck size was 12.5 +/- 2.4 mm. All lesions were successfully clipped without residual aneurysms. Post-operative images revealed no major branch occlusion due to thromboembolic complications. Four patients presented neurologic deficits caused by vasospasm, 3 of which were completely resolved by postoperative treatment. At a mean follow-up time of 1.86 +/- 0.95 years (range, 0.5-3.5 years), none of the patients died, and 96.2% (n = 25) of the patients had favorable clinical outcomes with modified Rankin Scale values of 0-2.
   CONCLUSIONS: For patients with giant wide-neck paraclinoid aneurysms, EOB-assisted microsurgical clipping is a safe and useful procedure for obtaining vascular control, for softening and shrinking the aneurysm sac and for providing a wide and clean operative field that allows the clip to be effectively placed.

AB BACKGROUND: Clinical and radiographic degenerative spondylolisthesis (CARDS) classification defines a distinct subset of patients with kyphotic angulation at the involved segment (type D). Research using CARDS classification to investigate motion characteristics at involved segments or patient-related outcomes (PROs) following surgical intervention is sparse. We investigated the relationship between CARDS type D spondylolisthesis and dynamic instability and PROs in type D versus nonetype D spondylolisthesis.
   METHODS: We reviewed consecutive patients who received transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion for L4-5 spondylolisthesis between 2009 and 2015. Patients were assigned into type D and nonetype D groups. Translational motion was determined by upright lumbar lateral radiography with supine sagittal magnetic resonance imaging or flexion and extension radiography. Demographics, radiographic parameters, and PROs were evaluated.
   RESULTS: Type D and nonetype D groups comprised 34 and 163 patients, respectively. Compared with nonetype D, type D group was characterized by lordotic angulation loss and higher degree of olisthesis on upright radiographs and demonstrated higher translational motion on upright lumbar lateral radiography with supine sagittal magnetic resonance imaging analysis. After surgery, mean reduction rate was significantly higher in type D group; type D had less slippage, but differences in slip angle and disc height were not significant. Preoperative Oswestry Disability Index and visual analog scale for back pain scores were higher in type D group. Type D spondylolisthesis and dynamic instability were associated with achieving minimal clinically important differences in PROs.
   CONCLUSIONS: CARDS type D spondylolisthesis is a distinct subset associated with dynamic instability and worse PROs. Higher improvement in PROs can be achieved in CARDS type D spondylolisthesis after surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effect of the position of stimulation contacts relative to the hyperdirect pathway (HDP) on the alleviation of motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson disease (PD).
   METHODS: A group of 11 patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD were included in this study, and all selected targets were in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). In 1 patient, a single side electrode was implanted because of unilateral symptoms; in all other patients, bilateral electrodes each containing 4 discrete contacts were implanted. Nine contacts were excluded due to adverse reactions caused by stimulation, and thus a total of 75 active contacts were evaluated using the same stimulus parameters. Fiber tractography results were individually processed using StealthViz software before all data were subjected to statistical analysis.
   RESULTS: Under the same stimulus parameters, the shortest distance of each contact to the HDP was smaller in group I (n = 45; >50% improvement rate) compared with group II (n = 30; <= 50% improvement rate) (mean, 1.18 +/- 0.86 mm vs. 2.14 +/- 1.20 mm; t = 3.78; P < 0.05), and the shortest distance had a negative correlation with the improvement of motor symptoms (r = L0.48; P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Stimulation of the HDP coincided with the improvement of motor symptoms in patients with PD. We propose an improvement of the direct visualization method based on diffusion tensor imaging fiber tractography of the HDP to select the motor part of the STN. Further rigorous clinical trials are needed to verify the value of this method for achieving precise target location and individualized treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: Whether intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) before mechanical thrombectomy (MT) provides additional benefits remains controversial. We aimed to compare clinical and radiologic outcomes between IVT + MT and MT alone groups.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and radiological features of patients from the prospectively collected database who sustained anterior circulation stroke due to large vessel occlusion (IVO) and were treated with MT within 8 hours of symptom onset. We compared rates of successful reperfusion, functional independence and mortality at 90 days, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) as clinical endpoints between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: The 81 patients included in this study included 38 (46.9%) in the MT alone group (mean age, 72.6 +/- 14.1 years; 17 males [44.7%]) and 43 in the IVT + MT group (mean age, 68.9 +/- 12.8 years; 29 males [67.4%]). There were no significant differences in patient baseline characteristics between the 2 groups except for a male predominance in the IVT+ MT group. The mean interval from onset to groin puncture (221.6 +/- 110.5 minutes vs. 204.7 +/- 63.7 minutes; P = 0.472) and the rate of successful reperfusion rate (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2b/3, 60.5% vs. 58.1%; P = 0.827) did not differ significantly between the MT and IVT + MT groups. The rate of favorable functional outcome, as determined by a modified Rankin Scale score 0-2 (36.8% vs. 51.2%; P = 0.263) and mortality at 90 days (18.4% vs. 9.3%; P = 0.332), and the rate of sICH (5.3% vs, 4,6%; P = 1.000) were also not significantly different between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that previous IVT might not facilitate successful reperfusion and favorable functional outcomes in patients with anterior circulation stroke treated with MT. MT alone can be a safe and effective treatment modality in patients who are ineligible for IVT for various reasons.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with a glioblastoma (GB) amenable only for subtotal resection (STR) represent a challenge in patient counseling. Our objective was to assess impact of extent of resection (EoR) on survival and clinical outcome of these patients.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicenter assessment. Patients receiving an intended STR in 3 centers with unilocular, primary, highly eloquent GB who received the same adjuvant treatment were included. We assessed EoR, neurologic outcome, and rate of complications. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated with Kaplan-Meier estimations. We used 1% EoR and 1-cm(3) steps to detect a threshold for a minimal EoR and residual tumor volume (RV) to be beneficial for survival and performed multivariate Cox regression models to assess its influence on PFS and OS.
   RESULTS: In total, 67 patients were included. EoR and RV were not significantly associated with PFS in multivariate Cox regression. Multivariate Cox regression model for OS revealed that volumetric EoR is a significant predictor for OS (P = 0.002, OR 0.982), same as RV (P = 0.007, OR 1.03), controlling for age, preoperative tumor volume, sex, and recurrent surgery. We found a significant benefit for OS if an EoR >60% or a RV <8 cm(3) was reached. In the aforementioned multivariate Cox regression models, an EoR <= 60% and a RV >= 8 cm(3) independently showed a significantly negative association with OS (P = 0.044, OR 1.96/P = 0.024, OR 2.07).
   CONCLUSIONS: In highly eloquent GB, EoR significantly matters for patients' OS. Also, potential RV should be considered when treating these patients. In cases with an expected RV above or an EoR below the aforementioned thresholds, open surgery should be carefully considered.

TI Impact of Laterality on Surgical Outcome of Glioblastoma Patients: A
   Retrospective Single-Center Study
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DE Dominant hemisphere; Extent of resection; Glioblastoma; Laterality
ID HIGH-GRADE GLIOMAS; RESECTION; SURVIVAL
AB BACKGROUND: Resection of left hemisphere (LH) tumors is often complicated by the risks of causing language dysfunction. Although neurosurgeons' concerns when operating on the presumed dominant hemisphere are well known, literature evaluating laterality as a predictive surgical parameter in glioblastoma (GB) patients is sparse. We evaluated whether tumor laterality correlated with surgical performance, functional outcome, and survival,
   METHODS: AU patients with GB treated at our institution between 2006 and 2016 were reviewed. Analysis comprised clinical characteristics, extent of resection (EOR), neurologic outcome, and survival in relation to tumor lateralization.
   RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-five patients were included. Right hemisphere (RH) tumors were larger and more frequently extended into the frontal lobe. Preoperatively, limb paresis was more frequent in RH, whereas language deficits were more frequent in LH tumors (P = 0.0009 and P < 0.0001, respectively). At 6 months after resection, LH patients presented Lower Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score (P 0.036). More patients with LH tumors experienced dysphasia (P < 0.0001), and no difference was seen for paresis. Average FOR was comparable, but complete resection wag achieved less often in LH tumors (37.7 vs. 64.8%; P = 0.0028). Although overall survival did not differ between groups, progression-free survival was shorter in LH tumors (7.4 vs. 10.1 months; P = 0.0225).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with LH tumors had a pronounced KPS score decline and shorter progression-free survival without effects on overall survival. This observation might partially be attributed to a more conservative surgical resection. Further investigation is needed to assess whether systematic use of awake surgery and intraoperative mapping results in increased FOR and improved quality survival of patients with GB.

TI Effects of Subthalamic Stimulation on Olfactory Function in Parkinson
   Disease
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Deep brain stimulation; Olfaction; Parkinson disease
ID DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; IDENTIFICATION; DISORDERS; NUCLEUS
AB BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction is a nonmotor symptom of Parkinson disease (PD) associated with reduction in quality of life. There is no evidence on whether improvements in olfaction after subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) may be directly attributable to motor improvement or whether this reflects a direct effect of DBS on olfactory brain areas. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of DBS on olfactory function in PD, as well as to explore the correlation between these changes and changes in motor symptoms and brain metabolism.
   METHODS: Thirty-two patients with PD were screened for STN-DBS. Patients were evaluated before and 1 year after surgery. Primary outcome was the change in olfactory function (Sniffin' Sticks odor-identification test [SST]) after surgery among the patients with hyposmia at baseline. Secondary outcomes included the relationship between motor outcomes and olfactory changes and [F-18] fluo-rodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography analysis between subgroups with improvement versus no improvement of smell.
   RESULTS: STN-DBS improved SST after surgery (preoperative SST, median 7.3 +/- 2.4 vs. postoperative SST, median 8.2 +/- 2.1; P = 0.045) in a subset of patients among 29 of 32 patients who presented with hyposmia at baseline. The improvement in SST was correlated with DBS response (r = 0.424; P = 0.035). There was also an increase in glucose metabolism in the midbrain, cerebellum, and right frontal lobe in patients with SST improvement (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: STN-DBS improves odor identification in a subset of patients with PD. Motor improvement together with changes in the brain metabolism may be linked to this improvement.

DE Conflicts of interest; Ethics; Industry; Neurosurgery; Open Payments
   Database; Sunshine Act

AB OBJECTIVE: The 2013 Physician Payments Sunshine Act mandates that all U.S. drug and device manufacturers disclose payments to physicians. All payments are made available annually in the Open Payments Database (OPD). Our aim was to determine prevalence, magnitude, and nature of these payments to physicians performing neurologic surgery in 2015 and to discuss the role that financial conflicts of interest play in neurosurgery.
   METHODS: All records of industry financial relationships with physicians identified by the neurological surgery taxonomy code in 2015 were accessed via the OPD. Data were analyzed in terms of type and amounts of payments, companies making payments, and comparison with previous studies.
   RESULTS: In 2015, 83,690 payments (totaling $99,048,607) were made to 7613 physicians by 330 companies. Of these, 0.01% were >$1 million, and 73.2% were <$100. The mean payment ($13,010) was substantially greater than the median ($114). Royalties and licensing accounted for the largest monetary value of payments (74.2%) but only 1.7% of the total number. Food and beverage payments were the most commonly reported transaction (75%) but accounted for only 2.5% of total reported monetary value. Neurologic surgery had the second highest average total payment per physician of any specialty.
   CONCLUSIONS: The neurological surgery specialty receives substantial annual payments from industry in the United States. The overall value is driven by a small number of payments of high monetary value. The OPD provides a unique opportunity for increased transparency in industry-physician relationships facilitating disclosure of financial conflicts of interest.

   EXPERIENCE; SYSTEM
AB OBJECTIVE: Meningiomas are the most frequent benign intracranial tumors and they are becoming more frequent because of the aging population and advances in diagnostics and neurosurgical treatment. Therefore, there will be an increase of this disease in the coming years.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients older than 70 years who underwent surgery for intracranial meningiomas, and we established risk factors related to outcome, morbidity, and mortality. We compared 3 previously described scores (Geriatric Scoring System [GSS], Clinico-Radiological Grading System [CRGS], and Sex, Karnofsky, ASA, Location and Edema [SKALE] score).
   RESULTS: We identified 110 patients older than 70 years. In the univariate analysis, postoperative Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) was related to the presence of edema (P = 0.036), tumor size (P = 0.043), previous neurologic impairment (P = 0.012), and preoperative American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification (P = 0.029). In the multivariable logistic regression model, ASA classification (odds ratio, 0.324; P = 0.04) and preoperative KPS (odds ratio, 1.042; P = 0.05) were also statistically significant. In all cases, better survival curves in the Kaplan-Meier survival test appear in patients with lower scores (CRGS, P = 0.015; GSS, P = 0.014; SKALE, P < 0.001). Also, morbidity measured as postoperative KPS correlated with these scores (CRGS, P < 0.001; SKALE, P < 0.001; GSS, P < 0.001). However, only SKALE correlated with perioperative morbidity, mortality, and 1-year mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS: Meningioma resection in patients older than 70 years is safe, with an acceptable rate of mortality and morbidity. Patients who should undergo surgery must be selected in relation to their comorbidities, such as ASA classification or preoperative KPS. However, SKALE could be a useful tool as an initial approach.

AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Low back and pelvic pain are among the most prevalent conditions worldwide, with major social and economic costs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) of lumbosacral plexus in the management and outcomes of these patients with chronic pain.
   METHODS: Consecutive patients with chronic lumbosacral and pelvic pain referred for MRN over a year were included. Preimaging and postimaging clinical diagnosis and treatment, pain levels, and location were recorded. Pain-free survival was compared between treatments using a Cox proportional hazards model.
   RESULTS: A total of 202 patients with mean age 53.7 +/- 14.8 years and a male/female ratio of 1:1.53 were included. Of these patients, 115 presented with radiculopathy (57%), 56 with pelvic pain (28%), and 31 with groin pain (15%). Mean initial pain level was 6.9 +/- 1.9. Mean symptom duration was 4.21 +/- 5.86 years. Of these patients, 143 (71%) had a change in management because of MRN. After MRN, reduction in pain levels was observed in 21 of 32 patients receiving conservative treatment (66%), 42 of 67 receiving injections (63%), and 27 of 33 receiving surgery (82%). Follow-ups were available in 131 patients. Median pain-free survival was 12 months. Patients treated with surgery had significantly lower pain recurrence than patients receiving other treatments in the same time frame (hazard ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-9.2; P = 0.0061).
   CONCLUSIONS: MRN use in chronic lumbosacral and pelvic pain led to a meaningful change in diagnosis and treatment. After MRN, conservative treatment and injections provided pain relief; however, patients benefited more from surgery than from any other treatment.

AB INTRODUCTION: Secondary cerebral insults can adversely affect patients with traumatic brain injury. By contrast, the incidence of secondary cerebral insults after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and their impact on outcome have been less well studied.
   METHODS: Four hundred and twenty-one patients with SAH who underwent surgical occlusion of their ruptured aneurysm and who received intensive care unit care for >= 48 hours were retrospectively identified from a prospective observational database. Patients were managed according to standard recommendations for SAH. Three secondary cerebral insults were examined: hypotension (<90 mmHg systolic), hypoxia (PaO2 < 60 mm Hg), and hyperglycemia (>200 mg/dL).
   RESULTS: A secondary cerebral insult was observed in 309 (73.4%) patients including 135 (32.1%) who had multiple insults. There was an association between worse clinical grade and development of secondary insults (P = 0.0002), particularly multiple insults (P < 0.0001). When stratified by clinical grade, single (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-4.51; P = 0.026) and multiple (adjusted OR, 4.37; 95% CI, 2.14-8.93; P < 0.0001) secondary cerebral insults were associated with worse outcome. In multivariate analysis and controlling for age, admission clinical grade, severity of SAH on computed tomography, intracerebral hematoma, increased intracranial pressure (>20 mm Hg), rebleed, intraoperative rupture, and hydrocephalus, secondary cerebral insults were independently associated with poor outcome (adjusted OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.20-5.02; P = 0.014).
   CONCLUSIONS: Secondary cerebral insults (hypoxia, hypotension, and hyperglycemia) are common after SAH, including among patients with a good clinical grade. These insults after SAH are associated with worse outcome. These data suggest that prevention of secondary cerebral insults may provide an opportunity to improve patient outcome after SAH.

AB OBJECTIVE: To observe effect of application of gelatin sponge impregnated with a mixture of 3 drugs to intra-operative nerve root block to promote early postoperative recovery of lumbar disc herniation.
   METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed of 265 patients with single-level lumbar disc herniation from January 2013 to October 2017. Patients were divided into intervention and control groups based on intraoperative application of gelatin sponge impregnated with a mixture of 3 drugs. All patients underwent unilateral minimally invasive surgical transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. Clinical data, including bedridden period, postoperative hospital stay, visual analog scale scores for low back pain and leg pain, Japanese Orthopaedic Association score, postoperative satisfaction questionnaire results, and therapeutic effect, were collected.
   RESULTS: There were 136 cases in the intervention group and 129 cases in the control group. The intervention group had significantly shorter bedridden period and postoperative hospital stay than control group (P < 0.05). Visual analog scale scores for low back pain and leg pain at postoperative days 1-10 were significantly lower in the intervention group compared with control group (P < 0.05). The Japanese Orthopaedic Association score at postoperative day 6 and satisfaction at 72 hours postoperatively were significantly higher in the intervention group than in control group (P < 0.05). Clinical effect at postoperative day 6 was significantly better in the intervention group than control group (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Application of gelatin sponge impregnated with a mixture of 3 drugs to intraoperative nerve root block can significantly promote early postoperative recovery of lumbar disc herniation and has great short-term clinical efficacy.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) often are studied together with patients with severe TBI, even though the expected outcome of the former is better. Therefore, we aimed to describe patient characteristics and 12-month outcomes, and to develop a prognostic model based on admission data, specifically for patients with moderate TBI.
   METHODS: Patients with Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 9-13 and age >= 16 years were prospectively enrolled in 2 level I trauma centers in Europe. Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) score was assessed at 12 months. A prognostic model predicting moderate disability or worse (GOSE score <= 6), as opposed to a good recovery, was fitted by penalized regression. Model performance was evaluated by area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristics curves.
   RESULTS: Of the 395 enrolled patients, 81% had intracranial lesions on head computed tomography, and 71% were admitted to an intensive care unit. At 12 months, 44% were moderately disabled or worse (GOSE score <= 6), whereas 8% were severely disabled and 6% died (GOSE score <= 4). Older age, lower Glasgow Coma Scale score, no day-of-injury alcohol intoxication, presence of a subdural hematoma, occurrence of hypoxia and/or hypotension, and preinjury disability were significant predictors of GOSE score <= 6 (area under the curve = 0.80).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with moderate TBI exhibit characteristics of significant brain injury. Although few patients died or experienced severe disability, 44% did not experience good recovery, indicating that follow-up is needed. The model is a first step in development of prognostic models for moderate TBI that are valid across centers.

AB OBJECTIVE: Intracerebral hemorrhage continues to be a major global problem. No standard treatment or surgical procedure has been identified for intracerebral hemor-rhages. High morbidity and mortality rates caused by conventional approaches and the disease itself have necessitated more-invasive treatment methods. The endo-scopic approach is a more minimally invasive method than craniotomy, which is another alternative surgical treatment.
   METHODS: We compared intracerebral hematoma drainage in 2 groups of 17 patients each, treated with minimally invasive endoscopic method versus craniotomy. All the patients were treated for supratentorial spontaneous hemorrhage between December 2013 and February 2017 at the Neurosurgery Clinic of Ankara University Faculty of Medicine.
   RESULTS: We retrospectively evaluated 34 patients surgically treated between December 2013 and February 2017. All patients underwent surgery within the first 24 hours. Patients in the early surgery group had better surgical outcomes. In the neuroendoscopic group, Glasgow Coma Scale increased from 6 to 11 at 1 week postoperatively compared with 5 to 9 in the craniotomy group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive endoscopic hematoma evacuation may be a good alternative surgical method for treating supratentorial spontaneous cerebral hematomas.

   DEFICITS; DAMAGED PATIENTS; SURGERY; LIFE
AB BACKGROUND: Constructional apraxia (CA) is a neuropsychological impairment of either basic perceptual and motor abilities or executive functions, in the absence of any kind of motor or perceptual deficit. Considering patients with focal brain tumors, CA is common in left or right parietal and parieto-occipital lesions. In neuropsychology, the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCFT; or parallel forms) is commonly used for the assessment of CA. This study stems from a clinical observation of a difficulty with CA tests for the majority of older neurosurgical patients without occipitoparietal lesions.
   METHODS: Patients were tested at 3 points: before surgery, 3 months after surgery, and 12 months after surgery. Thirty patients (15 meningiomas and 15 glioblastomas) were studied retrospectively.
   RESULTS: Older patients with focal brain lesions, regardless of the nature of the tumor, performed poorly at CA tests. More than 50% of patients obtained pathologic results at all 3 times considered.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that as CA complex tests involve multiple domains, poor results in copy task may reflect a global cognitive deficit of older patients with tumors, without a specific constructional praxis deficit. CA complex tests (such as the ROCFT) do not give significant informations about visuo-constructional abilities.

AB BACKGROUND: The benefits associated to the surgical treatment of brain metastases (BMs) in elderly patients has been extensively debated due to their higher biological fragility, but we still miss a "threshold." The aim of this study is to evaluate their outcomes by a systematic comparison with a cohort of the youngest patients of our series of BMs.
   METHODS: The surgical, radiologic, and oncologic outcomes of patients suffering from BM have been retrospectively reviewed for the present study. The patients have been subsequently assigned, according to their age in 2 groups: group A (<45 years old) and group B (>70 years old). Patient, surgery, and lesion- related data were recorded to identify the relationships with the following outcome variables: postoperative Karnofsky performance status, complications, and accessibility to adjuvant treatment.
   RESULTS: The final cohort consisted of 309 patients, 201 men (65.2%) and 108 women (34.8%); average age was 39.1 +/- 3.4 years for group A and 74.8 +/- 2.9 years for group B. Expected survival was 6.15 +/- 2.18 months for group A and 5.01 +/- 2.43 months for group B. The statistical analysis disclosed no significant difference between the 2 groups, in term of postoperative Karnofsky performance status and the incidence of complications. Important, the accessibility to adjuvant treatment was not different between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: The surgical treatment of BM in the septuagenarian patients is safe and effective. It increases the chances of long-term survival by preserving the functional and neurological status and leaving intact the accessibility to adjuvant treatments, similarly to what happens in the younger patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of the inhibitor of histone deacetylase (6HDAC6), tubastatin A, on the functional recovery of injured central branch of dorsal root ganglia (cauda equina).
   METHODS: A total of 30 Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10 for each group) were divided randomly into sham operation (sham group), cauda equina compression control (CEC control group), and cauda equina compression plus tubastatin A treatment (tubastatin A group). The tail-flick test was performed to detect the sense of pain and warmth as well as motor function. Immunoblotting/immunofluorescence experiments, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining, and hematoxylin-eosin staining were performed to detect the amount of HDAC6 in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, degree of apoptosis in DRG neurons, and degree of cauda equina injury, respectively.
   RESULTS: The ratio of apoptotic cells in the CEC control group was greater than that in the sham group, whereas it decreased in the tubastatin A group. Hematoxylin-eosin staining revealed that the fibers of cauda equina in the tubastatin A group were more compact compared with those in the CEC control group. The expression of HDAC6 was not different between the sham and CEC control groups, whereas it decreased significantly in the tubastatinA group. Tubastatin A administration shortened tail-flick latency on the seventh day after operation compared with the CEC control group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Tubastatin A significantly decreased the expression of HDAC6 in DRG neurons with injured cauda equina, inhibited the apoptosis of neural cells and axonal demyelinating changes in cauda equina, and partially promoted the recovery of neural function.

AB INTRODUCTION: Removal of midline paraventricular gliomas is difficult because of their deep localization and invasive character, requiring biopsy for pathologic diagnosis. This study aimed to assess the pathologic findings and clinical course of midline paraventricular gliomas diagnosed using a neuroendoscope.
   METHODS: This study was performed as a retrospective investigation using a neuroendoscope of 26 patients whose tumors were diagnosed as midline paraventricular gliomas. The main loci of the lesions were the thalamus (11 patients), tectum (6 patients), and other areas (9 patients). Of these 26 patients, 21 (81%) had accompanying obstructive hydrocephalus. Surgery was performed via the lateral ventricle using a flexible scope. For patients with obstructive hydrocephalus, we added endoscopic third ventriculostomy, septostomy, and/ or plasty of the foramen of Monro. Pathologic diagnosis was determined according to hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry using anti-GFAP, anti-Ki-67, anti-H3-K27M, and anti-IDH1-R132H antibodies.
   RESULTS: The pathologic diagnoses were grade I (5 patients), grade II (3 patients), grade III (6 patients), and grade IV (4 patients) gliomas. Six patients were diagnosed as having high-grade glioma, which was difficult to distinguish between grade III and grade IV. Two patients were undiagnosable. H3-K27M was strongly positive in 8 of 15 patients with high-grade glioma. All patients with high-grade gliomas died or received best supportive care within 2 years after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neuroendoscopic surgery is useful for midline paraventricular gliomas in terms of the treatment of obstructive hydrocephalus, as well as pathologic diagnosis and genetic analysis, which are required under the World Health Organization 2016 classification.

AB OBJECTIVE: We present the findings of our prospective study assessing olfactory function outcome in patients undergoing a frontolateral approach for the resection of suprasellar lesions.
   METHODS: Eighteen consecutive patients (7 females, 11 males) surgically treated at our institute for suprasellar tumors were included in this prospective study. Olfactory function was evaluated at the admission and 14 days after the surgery using the standard 12-item "Sniffin' Sticks" screening (SSS) test. The olfactory outcome was correlated to the following variables: tumor type, size, consistency, and extent of vertical and lateral growth.
   RESULTS: Preoperative and postoperative SSS test mean values were, respectively, 9.11 and 8.72 (not significant: P = 0.274). In only 1 case (5%), with larger suprasellar extension, the difference between preoperative and postoperative SSS was >= 3 (reduction of 5 points). At the subjective evaluation, no patient stated a deficit in smelling.
   CONCLUSION: The frontolateral craniotomy is a minimally invasive route to treat suprasellar tumors and has a low approach-related morbidity. It allows tumor resection with low risk for the olfactory function. A risk factor for postoperative olfactory deficit could be significant brain retraction.

AB OBJECTIVE: Classical single-colored or multicolored 3-dimensional (3D) visualization of sectional images lacked in being realistic and revealed limited anatomical discrimination. Recently, a new technique called cinematic volume rendering for 3D reconstruction of computed tomography has been developed. The aim of this study was to analyze this new visualization algorithm from a technical perspective and to investigate potential benefits for neurosurgical applications.
   METHODS: A standard test in computer graphics called Cornell Box was adapted and applied for reproducibility of light effects in cinematic rendering opposed to classic rendering methods. Simulation of distinct camera effects such as variable apertures, exposition time, optics, and surface refinements are presented in a human skull, respectively. Postprocessing capabilities allow for immediate clinical use.
   RESULTS: This volume-rendering technique generates cadaver-like 3D reconstructions. By considering complex interactions between a scanned object and dynamic light patterns, a cinematic illumination of a 3D surface reconstruction can be achieved. A spinal tumor case and a complex intracranial carotid artery aneurysm are presented, comparing all available rendering techniques. Cinematic rendering results in greater spatial discrimination of neighboring anatomical structures.
   CONCLUSIONS: This technical and clinical description focuses on the neurosurgical relevance of a new rendering technique. Considering the improved image impression of cinematic rendering and viewers' perception, it seems likely that the technique will gain wide acceptance in the clinical routine.

DT Article
DE Glioblastoma; Resection; Supramaximal; Survival; Temporal lobe
ID MORPHOLOGY; BIOLOGY; GLIOMAS
AB BACKGROUND: Resection of the T1 contrast-enhancing portion of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has been shown to increase patient survival, although whether GBM resection beyond these boundaries has an additional survival benefit is not clear. In this study, we examined the effect of resecting the enhancement and a margin of brain tissue surrounding the enhancement in patients with GBM of the temporal lobe.
   METHODS: We identified 32 consecutive patients with temporal lobe GBM who underwent initial resection between 2012 and 2015. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed based on the following categories: subtotal resection (STR; <99% of contrast enhancement removed), gross total resection (GTR; 100% of T1 contrast enhancement removed), and supramaximal resection (SMR; removal of T1 contrast enhancement plus removal of at least 1 cm of brain tissue surrounding the enhancement).
   RESULTS: Patients undergoing SMR demonstrated a substantially improved median PFS (15 months) compared with those undergoing GTR (7 months) or those undergoing STR (6 months) (P < 0.003). A median OS advantage was also present in the SMR group (24 months) compared with the GTR (11 months) and STR (9 months) groups (P < 0.004). SMR significantly improved PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.093; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01-0.89; P = 0.039) and OS (HR, 0.169; 95% CI, 0.05-0.57; P < 0.004) when controlling for other variables. The complication rates did not differ among the resection groups (P = 0.66).
   CONCLUSIONS: Achieving SMR substantially improved survival in patients with temporal lobe GBM compared with GTR of the enhancement alone.

AB BACKGROUND: Transarticular screw fixation has fatal complications such as vertebral artery (VA), carotid artery, and spinal cord injuries. The landmarks for deciding the entry point for C1 lateral mass screws were clarified by using life-size 3-dimensional (3D) patient-specific spine models.
   METHODS: This study included a total of 10 patients with Cl fractures. Dual-energy computed tomography (CT) scan data from Cl pre- and postscrewing were modified into 3D patient-specific life-size cervical spine models. The detailed information, such as bony and vascular elements, of 13 separate parameters of Cl was used as an intra-operative reference.
   RESULTS: 3D patient-specific models were created preoperatively with the fracture and postoperatively with the screwed vertebrae. After CT scans of the models were measured, the life-size patient-specific models were proven to be individualized. 3D models assisted in determining the fracture locations, pedicle sizes, and positions of the VA. The range of the measurements for ideal point of entry reveals the need for patient-specific intervention was required,
   CONCLUSIONS: 3D models were used in surgical planning maximizing the possibility of ideal screw position and providing individualized information concerning cervical spinal anatomy, The individualized 3D printing screw insertion template was user-friendly, of moderate cost, and it enabled a radiation-free cervical screw insertion.

   CLASSIFICATION; EXPERIENCE
AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate initial pain relief and subsequent recurrence after percutaneous balloon compression (PBC) and describe its association with the nature of trigeminal pain, previous procedures, or other clinical factors.
   METHODS: A total of 222 patients with medically refractory trigeminal pain treated with PBC at Mayo Clinic Florida between 1998 and 2017 were enrolled into this study. Patients were divided into those with typical trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and those with atypical trigeminal pain. The postprocedural rate of pain recurrence and associations between patient characteristics and recurrence were studied.
   RESULTS: One hundred fifty-two patients had TN and 70 patients had atypical pain. At the last follow-up, 158 patients had excellent pain relief, 37 had good pain relief, 11 had fair pain relief, and 16 had poor pain relief. The median duration of follow-up was 31.1 months. Patients with atypical pain were less likely to have an excellent result compared with patients with typical pain (61.4% vs. 82.9%; P < 0.001). Recurrence was observed in 103 patients (46.4%) and was associated with previous procedures (hazard ratio, 1.658; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-2.49; P = 0.017). Other clinical factors were not significant.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the safety and efficacy of PBC, with 88% of patients pain-free at last follow-up. Patients with atypical pain have worse outcomes, and patients with previous procedures have a higher risk of recurrence. Repeat surgery does not decrease efficacy. We recommend conservative parameter selection at the initial procedure.

AB OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively analyze clinical data of 4 patients with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) secondary to osteoid osteoma (OO) of the petrous bone and discuss treatment for this rare disease.
   METHODS: Between January 2008 and December 2016, 4 patients in whom TN secondary to petrous bone OO was diagnosed received surgical treatment in Xuan Wu Hospital of Capital Medical University. We summarized the characteristics and treatments of this rare disease through retrospective review of the clinical information, imaging features, surgical details, and follow-up outcomes of the 4 patients.
   RESULTS: Among the 4 patients, 2 were men; mean age was 39.3 +/- 12.3 years (range, 26-52 years). All patients presented with symptoms of typical TN. Preoperative bone window computed tomography scan of the brain showed a regular bony lesion located at the petrous bone, contacting the trigeminal nerve. All patients experienced total relief of symptoms after surgical resection of the lesion by retrosigmoid sinus approach. During a mean follow-up of 14.2 months (range, 7-23 months), no preoperative symptoms recurred.
   CONCLUSIONS: TN secondary to petrous bone OO is extremely uncommon. Surgical decompression is an effective treatment for patients with petrous bone OO and associated TN.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore coagulation function in patients with brain tumors before and after craniotomy and tumor resection and to analyze its correlation with deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
   METHODS: This study enrolled 133 consecutive patients with brain tumors. Coagulation evaluation and limb venous ultrasonography were performed before and after surgery. Clinical characteristics and dynamic changes in coagulation parameters were recorded, and their correlations with DVT were analyzed.
   RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative DVT in patients with brain tumors was 10.5%. The average age of patients with DVT was older compared with patients without DVT (63.21 +/- 11.21 years vs. 50.24 +/- 11.95 years, P < 0.001), and the incidence of hepatitis B (21% vs. 4%, P = .035) was higher in patients with DVT compared with patients without DVT. D-dimer and fibrinogen were the most variable parameters during the perioperative period. In patients with DVT, D-dimer levels displayed a "zigzagging-rise" trend and were significantly higher than levels in patients without DVT. Platelet levels displayed a "first-descend-then-rise" trend and were significantly lower in patients with DVT on the second and third postoperative days.
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with brain tumors, D-dimer and fibrinogen were elevated postoperatively, manifesting as hypercoagulability. Postoperative DVT was correlated with aging and hepatitis B. A "zigzagging-rise" trend of D-dimer and a "sharp-descent" trend of platelets in the early postoperative period might predict DVT in patients with brain tumors.

AB OBJECTIVE: Nasoseptal flap reconstruction is a widely accepted method for reducing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage after endoscopic transnasal surgeries (ETSs). However, this method is associated with nasal complications and is difficult to apply repeatedly in recurrent cases. Therefore, alternative methods are needed.
   METHODS: Layers of autologous fascia lata were placed on the inside and outside of the dural defect to sufficiently cover it, and the grafts were compressed with an inflated balloon. A lumbar drainage system with a pressure-control valve was used for 72 hours postoperatively. We retrospectively analyzed data on patients with skull base lesions showing intracranial extensions that required wide opening of the ventral dura in ETS. Fifty cases (47 skull base tumors and 3 others) were included, 28 of which were recurrent cases.
   RESULTS: In 21 cases (42%), the nasal septum was not intact because of the previous ETS. Seventeen patients (34%) had a history of radiotherapy and 9 (18%) had undergone multisession radiotherapies. None of the 50 patients required additional surgery for postoperative CSF rhinorrhea, and 2 had intermittent CSF leakage that resolved with prolonged lumbar drainage placement for a week. Previous multisession radiotherapy was the only significant risk factor for the need of prolonged drainage (P = 0.029).
   CONCLUSIONS: The multilayer closure method with a pressure-control spinal drainage system is a simple, safe, and effective method for preventing postoperative CSF leakage, which can be readily applied to dural defects in any parts of the skull base regions and in patients with various conditions.

AB BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is one of the most common problems of patients with spinal cord injuries (SCIs). The current study aimed to evaluate the antiosteoporotic effects of curcumin on densitometry parameters and biomarkers of bone turnovers among patients with SCI.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current controlled clinical trial was conducted among 100 patients with SCI referred to an outpatient clinic of rehabilitation in Ilam City, Iran, in 2013-2015. The intervention group received 110/mg/kg/day curcumin for 6 months and the control group received placebo. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured in all patients. The level of procollagen type I Nterminal propeptide, serum carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, osteocalcin, and bone-specific alkaline phosphates were compared before and after study.
   RESULTS: BMD indicators of lumbar, femoral neck, and total hip in the control group significantly decreased compared with the beginning of study. However, in the curcumin group, a significant increase was observed in BMD indicators of lumbar, femoral neck, and hip at the end of study compared with the beginning. There was also a significant difference between interventional and control groups for the mean BMD of femoral neck and hip at the end of study (0.718 +/- 0.002 g/cm(2) vs. 0.712 +/- 0.003 g/cm(2) and 0.742 +/- 0.031 g/cm(2) vs. 0.692 +/- 0.016 g/cm(2), respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Curcumin, via modulation of densitometry indices and bone resorption markers, showed inhibitory effects on the process of osteoporosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Prognosis of patients with melanoma brain metastasis is poor despite various chemotherapeutic agents. Researchers focus on finding effective treatment with a low risk of toxicity. Thymoquinone (TO) has been found to be effective on different types of cancer. However, no data exist regarding the effect of TO in intracerebral melanoma. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of TO in B16-F10 melanoma cell in vitro and intracerebral melanoma in vivo.
   METHODS: The mechanisms of efficacy were investigated using adenosine triphosphate assay for cytotoxicity, flow cytometry, and acridine orange staining for apoptosis, comet assay for genotoxicity, CM-H2DCF-DA (2,7-dichlorodihydrofloorescein) for intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and ELISA methods for inflammatory cytokines. Western blotting was performed to assess the expressions of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, and survivin. In addition, the effect of TO was investigated in a model system of intracerebral melanoma in syngeneic mice.
   RESULTS: The median survival was improved by TO in mice with intracerebral melanoma compared with the control group (16 days vs 9 days; P = 0.008). Cytotoxicity was enhanced by TO. in 816-F10 cells in a dose-dependent manner. TO also induced apoptosis, DNA damage, and increased intracellular ROS. TO inhibited p-STAT3, resulting in apoptosis through regulation of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that TO would be an effective treatment in intracerebral metastatic lesions. This warrants further investigation.

AB BACKGROUND: A pterional-orbital or subfrontal-orbital approach is recommended as a surgical treatment in cranio-orbital lesions. We describe a less invasive approach through an eyebrow incision combined supraorbital minicraniotomy and orbital osteotomy for treating some selected cranio-orbital lesions.
   METHODS: Sixteen patients with different cranio-orbital lesions were treated using this less invasive approach. Postoperative outcomes were evaluated to shed light on specific parameters related to this approach.
   RESULTS: The 16 patients with cranio-orbital lesions underwent 17 operations. A total resection was achieved in 11 lesions. All the patients were followed up for 3-54 months. Postoperative proptosis improved in all cases. Five cases of visual impairment were improved, but 4 patients with blindness did not recover. One patient with bitemporal hemianopia recovered. Three patients with ocular dyskinesia did not recover. Two patients had transient cranial nerve III palsy, and 2 patients had cranial nerve VI palsy. One had delayed hydrocephalus. One died 1 year later as a result of pulmonary metastases. One recurred and the patient underwent a second operation. All the patients had a modified Rankin Scale score <= 1 at 12 weeks follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Some selected cranio-orbital lesions can be treated through a supraorbital eyebrow approach with orbital osteotomy. The presence of retro-ocular fat allows the orbital lesions to be classified as a lesion of the intraretro-ocular or extraretro-ocular fat. It is safe to resect the lesion of extraretro-ocular fat from the retro-ocular fat interface. However, the lesion with optic nerve and extraocular muscles involved should be removed from the intermuscular septae.

AB OBJECTIVE: Although the primary goal of treatment of type II odontoid fracture is bony union, some advocate continued nonsurgical management of minimally symptomatic older patients who have fibrous union or minimal fracture motion. The risk of this strategy is unknown. We reviewed our long-term outcomes after dens nonunion to define the natural history of Type II odontoid fractures in elderly patients managed nonoperatively.
   METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 50 consecutive adults aged 65 or older with Type II odontoid fracture initially managed nonsurgically from 1998 to 2012 at a single tertiary care institution was conducted. Particular attention was paid to patients who had orthosis removal despite absent bony fusion. Patients were contacted prospectively by telephone and followed until death, surgical intervention, or last known contact.
   RESULTS: Fifty patients initially were managed nonsurgically; of these, 21 (42.0%) proceeded to bony fusion, 3 (6%) underwent delayed surgery for persistent instability, and 26 (52%) had orthosis removal despite the lack of solid arthrodesis on imaging. The last group had a median follow-up of 25 months (range 4-158 months), with 20 of 26 (76.9%) followed until death. Of these patients, 1 patient developed progressive quadriplegia and dysphagia 11 months after initial injury. Compared with patients with spontaneous union, patients with nonunion had shorter life expectancy, despite no significant differences between the groups with respect to age, sex, injury mechanism, radiographic variables, or follow-up duration.
   CONCLUSIONS: Orthosis removal despite fracture nonunion may be reasonable in elderly patients with Type II dens fractures.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate 10 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 5 genes (CASP8, XRCC1, WRN, NF2, and BRIP1) to confirm the association between the 5 genes and the meningioma risk in a Chinese population.
   METHODS: We examined 10 candidate SNPs in 5 genes (CASP8, XRCC1, WRN, NF2, and BRIP1) to confirm the association between the 5 genes and the meningioma risk and tumor-related phenotype in 433 individuals, including 215 patients with meningioma and 218 controls.
   RESULTS: The polymorphisms rs4968451T>G in BRIP1 were significantly associated with the risk of meningioma (TT vs. TG vs. GG additive, P = 0.005; TT + TG vs. GG dominant, P = 0.015; TT/GT + GG recessive, P = 0.034). The significant association was found only in females for BRIP1 rs4968451T>G (TT + TG vs. GG dominant, P = 0.001; TT/GT + GG recessive, P = 0.044). We observed no significant association between genotypes and the meningioma risk for the other 9 SNPs. Through genotype-phenotype analysis, the genotype of BRIP1 rs4968451T>G was also strongly associated with tumor-related phenotypes, including the tumor grade and tumor subtypes. BRIP1 rs4968451T>G was associated with markedly grade I meningioma risk (TT + TG vs. GG dominant, P = 0.008; TT/GT + GG recessive, P = 0.020). In addition, BRIP1 rs4968451T>G was associated with markedly meningothelial and transitional meningioma risk. Furthermore, the genotype of CAPS8, XRCC1, and NF2 was associated with different subtype of meningioma risk.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated a role for BRIP1 gene variations in meningioma and may be informative for future genetic or biological studies of meningioma. These findings will assist in further understanding the genetic cause for meningiomas and guide more effective biological interventions to facilitate meningiomas.

AB BACKGROUND: Preserving functionality is important during neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. Specialized centers also map further brain functions apart from motor and language functions, such as arithmetic processing (AP). The mapping of AP by navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (nrTMS) in healthy volunteers has been reported.
   OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to correlate the results of mapping AP with functional patient outcomes.
   METHODS: We included 26 patients with parietal brain tumors. Because of preoperative impairment of AP, mapping was not possible in 8 patients (31%). We stimulated 52 cortical sites by nrTMS while patients performed a calculation task. Preoperatively and postoperatively, patients underwent a standardized number-processing and calculation test (NPCT). Tumor resection was blinded to nrTMS results, and the change in NPCT performance was correlated to resected AP-positive spots as identified by nrTMS.
   RESULTS: The resection of AP-positive sites correlated with a worsening of the postoperative NPCT result in 12 cases. In 3 cases, no AP-positive sites were resected and the postoperative NPCT result was similar to or better than preoperatively. Also, in 3 cases, the postoperative NPCT result was better than preoperatively, although AP-positive sites were resected.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite presenting only a few cases, nrTMS might be a useful tool for preoperative mapping of AP. However, the reliability of the present results has to be evaluated in a larger series and by intraoperative mapping data.

AB OBJECTIVE: There has been controversy as to whether intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) contributes to angiographic cerebral vasospasm (aCV) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). Computed tomography-based SAH scales that did and did not consider IVH were compared in terms of ability to predict aCV, DCI, and outcome.
   METHODS: We reviewed 390 patients with ruptured aneurysms who had been treated surgically by day 3 by the same surgeon (T. I.). aCV was graded as 0-4. Outcome at 6 months was classified using the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Inagawa SAH grades and scores, for which only SAH was evaluated, were compared with scales that evaluated both SAH and IVH (Fisher, Claassen, and Frontera grades, and Hijdra score). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated to compare severe aCV (grade 3-4), DCI, or poor outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 1-3).
   RESULTS: The Inagawa grade showed constant and significant intergrade differences in both aCV and DCI. The Inagawa grade area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values were highest among the scales examined. In the Fisher, Claassen, and Frontera grades, IVH was unlikely to be related to aCV and DCI. There was no significant difference in aCV grade or DCI occurrence between the Inagawa and Hijdra scores. In contrast, the presence of IVH was significantly associated with poor outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: In patients with aneurysmal SAH, IVH is an important factor affecting patient outcome, whereas computed tomography-based SAH scales that do not consider IVH are superior to scales that do consider it for prediction of aCV or DCI.

ID CERVICAL-SPINE; WOUNDS; CORD; CLASSIFICATION; UPDATE
AB OBJECTIVE: Spinal gunshot injuries are devastating injuries with significant morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study was to compare the varied neurologic presentations and radiologic findings with their outcomes after treatment. We applied the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Scale and Subaxial Cervical Spine Injury Classification to see whether the management of gunshot patients was performed according to the severity of the scores.
   METHODS: Between 2011 and 2014, 150 consecutive patients with spinal gunshot injury were admitted and treated at Liaquat National Hospital and Medical College, Karachi. We assessed patients neurologically by using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Scale. The morphologic parameters of injury were measured with the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Scale and Subaxial Cervical Spine Injury Classification. The patients were either conservatively or surgically treated, and the ASIA Scale was applied at 1, 12, and 24 months.
   RESULTS: In the study, the ASIA Scale was applied on admission, in which 39% were ASIA A, 9.8% B, 15.6% C, 12.3% D, and 28% E. ASIA A was most commonly seen in the thoracic region. Sixty-two percent of the patients were treated conservatively and 38% surgically. After we applied the thoracolumbar and cervical injury severity scores, 36 patients scored under the nonsurgical criteria, and 79 patients scored in the surgical criteria. Overall improvement was seen in 31% of the patients in whom thoracic region showed greatest progress.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with gunshot injury should be considered for surgery when there is potential for improvement, if there is persistent cord compression, or if there is deteriorating or incomplete neurology. Lumbar gunshot injury has a better outcome compared with thoracic followed by cervical injury.

AB OBJECTIVE: Effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation therapy (AC) after treatment of spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (sdAVF) are still inadequately discussed in the literature and are addressed in this study.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed our medical database for patients with sdAVF treated in our institution between 2006 and 2016. Neurologic status at time of admission, discharge, and last follow-up was assessed via Aminoff-Logue disability score.
   Patient cohorts were dichotomized as group A (post-operative therapeutic heparinization) and group B (routine thromboembolic prophylaxis with low-dose heparin).
   RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were included in this analysis. In group A (n = 11), no acute deterioration was reported. In group B (n = 42), 4 patients developed acute postoperative deterioration; therapeutic AC was initiated in all 4 patients resulting in complete neurologic recovery within the inpatient stay. However, the incidence of postoperative deterioration did not reach statistical significance between treatment groups (P = 0.57).
   Data of 40 patients were available for long-term analysis (mean, 53.4 +/- 36 months). Neurologic status did not differ significantly between both groups at time of admission (P = 0.093), discharge (P = 0.723), and last follow-up (P = 0.222).
   CONCLUSIONS: Acute postoperative deterioration in patients with sdAVF is a clinically relevant complication and was present in 7.5% of patients in our series. Although routine therapeutic AC did not decrease the rate of acute deterioration significantly, our findings imply that therapeutic AC in cases of acute postoperative deterioration might be a safe and efficient treatment option.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role and efficacy of fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition (FIESTA) imaging in distinguishing fat graft enhancement from residual or recurrent tumor after vestibular schwannoma (VS) surgery.
   METHODS: A retrospective study of 33 patients who underwent VS resection via the retrosigmoid or translabyrinthine approach with fat graft reconstruction was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was collected at different time points: preoperative, immediate postoperative (24-48 hours), delayed postoperative (3-6 months after surgery), and yearly postoperative. The image sets contained T1, T2, fat-suppressed T1-weighted with gadolinium, and FIESTA. The radiographs were analyzed for tumor recurrence by the primary neurosurgeon and an independent blinded neuroradiologist. If fat-suppressed T1-weighted images demonstrated postoperative enhancement in the resection bed, a comparison was made with FIESTA imaging.
   RESULTS: At 3-6 months postoperatively and at 1 year and beyond, 28 (84.8%) and 33 (100%) of patients, respectively, displayed delayed enhancement of the fat graft on postgadolinium fat-suppressed T1-weighted MRI. The enhancement seen on postgadolinium, fat-suppressed, T1-weighted MRI consistently correlated with the characteristic fat graft signal on FIESTA imaging and not tumor recurrence. FIESTA imaging was able to distinguish residual tumor from enhancing fat graft compared with postgadolinium, fat-suppressed, T1-weighted MRI (P < 0.0001) due to distinctive signaling patterns.
   CONCLUSIONS: FIESTA is an effective tool in discerning fat graft enhancement from residual or recurrent tumor on delayed postoperative imaging after VS resection. Fat graft used in reconstruction consistently enhances on delayed postoperative postgadolinium, fat-suppressed, T1-weighted imaging, which correlates with the fat graft signal seen on FIESTA images.

AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral hyperperfusion complicates the postoperative course of patients with moyamoya disease after direct revascularization surgery. There is no clear distinction between cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome and benign postoperative increase in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF).
   OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to determine clinically relevant changes in rCBF, anatomical correlations, and factors associated with transient neurologic symptoms after revascularization surgery in moyamoya disease.
   METHODS: Whole-brain voxel-based perfusion mapping was used to identify regions involved in cerebral hyperperfusion and quantify the changes in 105 hemispheric surgeries with the use of single-photon computed tomography acquired on postoperative day 7. The changes in rCBF were quantitatively analyzed, and associations with cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome were determined.
   RESULTS: Transient neurologic symptoms appeared with rCBF increase in 37.9% of adults. Speech impairments were associated with an increase in rCBF in the operculo-insula region. Cheiro-oral syndrome was associated with the posterior insula as well as the prefrontal region. A receiver operating curve analysis yielded transient neurologic symptoms with maximum accuracy at > 15.5% increase from baseline. Age and preoperative rCBF were independently associated with transient neurologic symptoms (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Areas showing rCBF increase during the experience of transient neurologic symptoms were spatially compatible with the known functional anatomy of the brain. An increase of approximately 15% from baseline was found to be critical, which is a far lower threshold than what has been reported previously. Increasing age was significantly associated with the occurrence of symptomatic hyperperfusion. Furthermore, patients with preserved rCBF also showed symptomatic hyperperfusion.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate patient attitudes toward acceptable levels of disability after decompressive surgery for malignant middle cerebral artery infarction, including impact of patient age, to improve process of surgical informed consent.
   METHODS: Patients who had experienced a recent minor stroke were asked to complete a questionnaire containing 2 parts: demographic information, including patient age, sex, years of education, working status, religion, and economic status, and acceptable level of disability based on modified Rankin Scale (mRS) with corresponding illustrations to explain mRS levels.
   RESULTS: Patient age was identified as an independent determinant of the worst acceptable mRS score with a negative correlation. For nondominant hemispheric malignant infarction, the worst acceptable mRS score was significantly lower (mean +/- SD 2.0 +/- 1.3) for the oldest patients (>70 years old) compared with patients <60 years old (mean +/- SD 3.0 +/- 0.6) and 60-70 years old (mean +/- SD 3.0 +/- 0.8). For dominant hemispheric malignant infarction with language impairment, all age groups showed a significantly lower value for worst acceptable mRS score (mean +/- SD 1.8 +/- 1.1 for patients <60 years old, 1.8 +/- 1.2 for patients 60-70 years old, and 1.0 +/- 1.4 for patients >70 years old).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients showed different attitudes toward disability according to their age. Patients >70 years old showed the lowest worst acceptable mRS score after surgical treatment of malignant infarction. Language impairment with dominant hemispheric infarction further decreased the worst acceptable mRS score.

   RADIOTHERAPY
AB BACKGROUND: We previously reported a favorable outcome in a case series of patients with oligodendrogliomas treated with upfront chemotherapy; however, their progression-free survival (PFS) was relatively short considering their long-term overall survival (OS). This suggests that salvage treatments after progression were effective. However, the clinical impact of salvage treatments on outcomes of patients with recurrent oligodendrogliomas has not been precisely investigated.
   METHODS: Our case series included 28 patients with newly diagnosed isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendroglial tumors treated with upfront procarbazine, nimustine, and vincristine. Clinical outcomes and patterns of recurrence were reviewed retrospectively.
   RESULTS: The median follow-up period of enrolled patients was 90.2 months. Disease progression occurred in 15 patients (53.6%), whereas the cancer appeared as local relapse alone in 14 (93.3%) patients. Salvage treatments were performed for all local relapses; thereafter, most of the subsequent progressions also appeared as resectable local relapses. The 5-year PFS and OS rates from the first progression were 30.3% and 92.9%, respectively. These relatively short PFS and favorable OS indicated the effectiveness of salvage treatment even after multiple progression. Thus far, 9 (60%) of 15 patients are deterioration-free with locally controlled lesions or complete remission; however, clinical deterioration was observed in 6 patients, and 4 of them experienced dissemination.
   CONCLUSIONS: In isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendrogliomas, most of the tumors that demonstrated early progression appeared as local, nonlethal lesions, which have been well-controlled by salvage treatments. A precise diagnosis of oligodendrogliomas using molecular parameters is crucial to receive the best benefit from salvage treatment.

AB INTRODUCTION: Grade IV vestibular schwannoma (Koos classification) is generally considered to be an indication for microsurgical resection or combined radiosurgery-microsurgery. However, the place of Gamma Knife stereotactic surgery (GK-SRS), either as first-line treatment or when progression of residual tumor compresses the brainstem, has not been clearly evaluated. This article reports the results of a large case series of patients with grade 4 vestibular schwannoma treated by GK-SRS.
   MATERIAL AND METHOD: All consecutive patients with grade IV vestibular schwannoma treated by GK-SRS in our department between 1996 and 2011 with a minimum follow-up of 3 years were included in this study.
   RESULTS: 86 patients were treated by GK-SRS with a minimum follow-up of 3 years. Mean follow-up was 6.2 years (3-16 years). The mean age of the patients at the time of GK-SRS was 54.6 years (range: 23-84) and the sex ratio was 0.6. At the time of radiosurgery, no patient presented brainstem dysfunction prior to GK-SRS. 38 patients had functional hearing before treatment. One patient presented mild trigeminal neuralgia before GK-SRS. Tumor control with no clinical deterioration was obtained in 78 patients (90.7%). No radiation-induced brainstem or cranial nerve toxicity was observed in any of these patients. Functional hearing was maintained in 25 patients. 8 (9.3%) patients presented tumor growth and required microsurgical resection in 7 cases and ventricular shunt in 1 case.
   CONCLUSION: On the basis of this large series, GK-SRS appears to be a safe and effective treatment option for grade IV vestibular schwannoma for patients with no signs of brainstem dysfunction.

AB OBJECTIVE: To systematically investigate the effect of 3-level hybrid constructs on the cervical spine biomechanics based on a validated model of the C3-C7 segments.
   METHODS: Three hybrid constructs with 2 U-shaped dynamic cervical implants and 1 cage were simulated. The 3 constructs were 1) Cage-U-U (cage implanted at the C3-C4 level and U-shaped dynamic cervical implants implanted at the C4-C5 and C5-C6 levels), 2) U-Cage-U, and 3) U-U-Cage. Biomechanical parameters including moments, cervical motions, and stresses in the facet and implants were analyzed in flexion and extension.
   RESULTS: The flexion and extension motions at artificial cervical disc replacement levels increased for all hybrid constructs when compared with those of intact model. However, the maximum increase was 52% with U-U-Cage model. At the unoperated adjacent level, the maximum motion increase in extension was 23% with the U-U-Cage model. Also, the U-U-Cage and U-Cage-U model generated more than 40% increase in terms of flexion motion at the adjacent level. The facet stress at the adjacent level increased by 28%, 20%, and 39% with the Cage-U-U, U-Cage-U, and U-U-Cage models, respectively. The moments required to reach the same motion as the intact model were significantly increased.
   CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that the U-U-Cage model lead to more compensation in terms of motion and facet stress. Furthermore, the present results imply that when conducting the hybrid surgery, the segmental motions should be taken into account. Performing anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at the level whose motion is relatively small may decrease the compensation required at the adjacent level.

AB BACKGROUND: Vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been suggested as a potential in vivo method to detect inflammation of aneurysm wall and identify unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) at high risk for rupture. This study aims to investigate the correlation between aneurysm wall enhancement (AWE) on vessel wall MRI and rupture-related morphological parameters in patients with multiple UIAs.
   METHODS: Clinical data and vessel wall MRI images were reviewed in 14 patients with 30 multiple UIAs. The AWE was defined as enhancement of the aneurysm wall in postcontrast vessel wall MRI using the precontrast MRI as a reference. Morphological parameters, including aneurysm size, aspect ratio, size ratio, bottleneck factor, heightto- width ratio, nonsphericity index (NSI), and inflow angle, were measured using 3-dimensional rotation angiography. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the correlations between morphological parameters and the presence of AWE.
   RESULTS: Sixteen of the 30 multiple UIAs presented with AWE on vessel wall MRI. On univariate analyses, UIAs with AWE were significantly larger (P [0.001) and had significantly higher aspect ratio (P = 0.047), size ratio (P = 0.003), bottleneck factor (P = 0.007), and NSI (P = 0.007) values. Further multivariate logistic regression showed that aneurysm size (odds ratio, 3.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-11.35; P = 0.033) and NSI (odds ratio, 3.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-11.80; P = 0.040) were independently associated with the presence of AWE in multiple UIAs.
   CONCLUSIONS: The presence of AWE on vessel wall MRI was significantly correlated with conventional morphological rupture risk factors in patients with multiple UIAs, which might indicate AWE as a potential radiologic predictor for UIAs with high rupture risk.

AB OBJECTIVE: Because of the health care initiative on quality improvement projects in academic medicine, this study explores the impact of different postgraduate years (PGYs) on unexpected re-operation rates.
   METHODS: Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program 2005-2014, adult neurosurgical cases were divided into subspecialties: spine, open vascular, cranial, and functional. Comparison groups were cases involving junior residents (PGY 1-PGY 3), mid-level residents (PGY 4 + PGY 5), and senior residents (PGY 6 + PGY 7). Comorbidity disease burden was measured by frailty index. The primary outcome measure was 30-day unintended return to the operating room.
   RESULTS: Of the 9782 cases, re-operations were higher for those cases featuring a senior resident (5.6%) compared with mid-level resident (4.1%) and junior resident (3.8%) (P = 0.001). Although senior residents operated on patients with a statistically significantly higher neurologic disease burden, greater relative value units, longer operative times, and more 30-day postoperative adverse events, the level of resident training did not have an impact on revision surgery after multivariable logistical regression. The strongest predictors of return to the operating room included the frailty index (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj] = 5.18, P < 0.001), functional subspecialty (ORadj = 2.65, P < 0.001), and Wound Class 4 - dirty/infected wound (ORadj = 2.33, P = 0.016).
   CONCLUSIONS: Resident participation in neurosurgical cases does not affect 30-day unplanned re-operation rates, which were affected by frailty index, functional subspecialty, and wound class.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate modifications in static spinal status after posterior decompression surgery without fusion in patients with symptomatic central canal stenosis.
   METHODS: From November 2014 to May 2016, 72 patients who underwent isolated decompression for lumbar spinal stenosis were enrolled prospectively in this single-center study. All of the patients had lateral full-body x-ray scans with the EOS system (EOS Imaging, Paris, France) before surgery and after 12 months of follow-up. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to their preoperative sagittal vertical axis (<50 mm, >= 50 mm, and <100 mm, >= 100 mm).
   RESULTS: SVA decreased significantly (SVA preoperative: 72.3 +/- 1 43.1, SVA postoperative: 48.3 +/- 46.8. P < 0.001). Lumbar lordosis increased significantly from 41.9 +/- 13.4 in the preoperative period to 46.5 +/- 14.8 at the last follow-up (P < 0.001). In the imbalance groups, the mean postoperative SVA decreased significantly compared with preoperative SVA (P = 0.004). Surgery led to a significant increase in lumbar lordosis in the 3 groups (P < 0.05). Nonetheless, a certain degree of residual imbalance persisted in the major imbalance group. In all of the groups, decompression surgery led to a significant improvement in clinical scores (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed an improvement in sagittal balance and lumbar lordosis after decompression surgery without fusion, even in patients with a preoperative SVA >100 ram. Howeverr a a ertain degree of sagittal imbalance may persist after surgery in patients with major initial imbalance (SVA >100 mm). Nonetheless, after surgery, these patients experienced a clinical benefit comparable with that in the other groups.

ID CEREBELLOPONTINE ANGLE; BASE
AB BACKGROUND: Petrous face meningiomas (PFMs) are challenging tumors because of their proximity to the cranial nerves, brainstem, and critical vasculature. The objective of this study is to present surgical outcomes and support an anatomic classification for PFM based on clinical presentation.
   METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed, and 51 PFMs were identified. Tumors were classified by location along the petrous face into anterior, middle, and posterior. Presentation and outcomes were analyzed with logistic regression.
   RESULTS: The median follow-up was 31.6 months. Tumors were World Health Organization grade I (n = 50), with 1 World Health Organization grade II tumor. Location was anterior (22%), middle (14%), posterior (53%), and over-lapping (12%). Median tumor diameter was 3.0 cm (range, 0.8-6.2 cm). Anterior location was associated with facial pain/numbness on presentation (P < 0.0001), middle location with hearing loss/vestibular dysfunction (P = 0.0035), and posterior with hydrocephalus (P = 0.0190), headache (P = 0.0039), and vertigo (P = 0.0265). Extent of resection was gross total (63%), near total (14%), and subtotal (25%). The observed radiographic recurrence rate was 15%. Mean progression-free survival after diagnosis was 9.1 years with 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year progression-free survival of 91.8%, 78.6%, and 62.9%, respectively. The complication rate was Age, location, and approach were not associated with complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: PFMs present with distinct clinical syndromes based on their location along the petrous face: anterior with trigeminal symptoms, middle with auditory/vestibular symptoms, and posterior with symptoms of mass effect/hydrocephalous. Surgical resection is associated with excellent long-term survival and a low rate of recurrence, which can be managed with radiotherapy.

AB BACKGROUND: Perineural spread leading to brachial plexopathy has recently been described in cases of melanoma. The occurrence and mechanism for nonmelanoma skin cancer spread to the brachial plexus is poorly understood.
   METHODS: A retrospective chart review of the Mayo Clinic database was conducted to identify patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer and brachial plexopathy between 2000 and 2017. Inclusion criteria were a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer, a clinical diagnosis of brachial plexopathy, imaging features of perineural spread, and a positive result of examination of a biopsy specimen showing tumor in a skin nerve.
   RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients with a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer and brachial plexopathy were identified. Inclusion criteria were fulfilled in 2 cases of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. One case of recurrent basal cell carcinoma with perineural spread confirmed in the brachial plexus by pathologic examination was excluded because confirmatory evidence of perineural spread from the skin to the brachial plexus was not available.
   CONCLUSIONS: Perineural spread of nonmelanoma skin cancer leading to brachial plexopathy is rare. Our 2 cases and the cases found in the literature demonstrate different entry points to the neural highway resulting in neurologic deficits. The cervical plexus serves as a hub for further spread in certain cases of perineural spread of skin cancer.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether the line between the digastric point and posterior edge of the occipital condyle (DC line) could be a new surface landmark for the posterior margin of the horizontal part of the sigmoid sinus.
   METHODS: Cadaveric specimens were used to show the relationship between the DC line and retrosigmoid craniotomy. Three-dimensional computed tomography angiography images of adult heads (56 sides) were analyzed to measure the distance between the DC line and the horizontal part of the sigmoid sinus at the digastric point, posterior edge of the condyle, and midpoint of the line.
   RESULTS: The DC line was roughly parallel and posterior to the posterior margin of the sigmoid sinus. The distance between the DC line and the posterior edge of the sigmoid sinus at the digastric point, condyle, and midpoint of the line measured 4.7 +/- 3.3 mm, 5.9 +/- 2.6 mm, and 1.3 +/- 2.2 mm, respectively. All sigmoid sinuses coursed anterior to the digastric point and condyle but in 17.9% (10/56 sides) the posterior edge of the sigmoid sinus extended a maximum of 4.1 mm posterior to the midpoint of the DC line.
   CONCLUSIONS: The DC line can be used as a new surface landmark for estimating the position of the horizontal part of the sigmoid sinus. The posterior edge of the sinus may extend posterior to the line at the midpoint; thus, care should be taken to prevent sinus injury when drilling around the midpoint of the line.

AB OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to report our experience in the surgical treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (cAVMs) related permanent symptomatic adverse radiation effects (PSAREs), to clarify an appropriate surgical management and to identify the risk factors related to their development.
   METHODS: We evaluated 549 patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for cAVMs with a follow-up of at least 8 years. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to test different risk factors related to the development of PSARE. We retrospectively reviewed the records of these patients to analyze the clinical outcome.
   RESULTS: Fourteen patients (2.5%) developed PSARE and were submitted to surgery. Higher average treated volume represents a significant risk factors for the development of PSARE (P < 0.05); on the other hand, older age and higher average dose reduce the risk of PSARE (P < 0.05). A favorable clinical outcome was achieved in 13 patients (93%) after surgery; in 1 patient, the unfavorable outcome was due to hemorrhage that occurred months after GKRS. Serial MRI scans following either surgical removal of the nodule or Ommaya reservoir positioning showed progressive reduction of brain edema in all cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: The management of PSARE is controversial, especially for cAVMs treated with SRS. Surgical removal is rarely needed, but-if unavoidable-it can be a valuable option in experienced hands. A careful preoperative planning is always necessary to detect pathologic blood flow through the PSARE.

AB OBJECTIVE: Unilateral expansive open-door cervical laminoplasty is an effective and safe procedure for cervical compressive myelopathy but occasionally is accompanied with significant intraoperative blood loss (SIBL). The aim of the present study was to elucidate the risk factors for SIBL in patients undergoing cervical laminoplasty for multilevel cervical compressive myelopathy and to identify the effect of SIBL on neurologic complications.
   METHODS: A total of 215 patients who received cervical laminoplasty between January 2010 and August 2016 were enrolled in the study. SIBL was defined as 500 mL or more of blood volume during surgery. Patients were subdivided into 2 groups according to whether they suffered from SIBL (n = 26) or not (n = 189). Patient characteristics and clinical data were collected. Univariate and multivariable analysis were performed to identify independent risk factors for SIBL.
   RESULTS: The incidence of SIBL during unilateral expansive open-door cervical laminoplasty was 12.1%. The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed Pavlov ratio (odds ratio = OR] 0.002, P = 0.009), ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OR 2.677, P = 0.038), and number of complete hinge fractures (OR 1.842, P = 0.015) were independent risk factors for SIBL during cervical laminoplasty. Patients with SIBL during cervical laminoplasty had a greater rate of neurologic complications during hospitalization (P = 0.012), worse neurologic recovery rate at discharge (P = 0.01), and longer post-operative length of stay (P = 0.003).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that Pavlov ratio, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and number of complete hinge fractures were independent risk factors for SBIL during cervical laminoplasty. SIBL in cervical laminoplasty was associated with greater neurologic complications and worse neurologic functional recovery.

AB BACKGROUND: Low-grade glioma (LGG) of the neuro-hypophysis is an extremely rare tumor arising from the pituicytes of the posterior pituitary or the infundibulum. The preoperative imaging findings of these tumors mimic those of pituitary adenomas, and radical resection is often challenging in affected patients due to the hypervascularity of the tumor. Here we describe the clinical and radiologic features of this clinical entity.
   METHODS: We identified 8 patients with LGG of the neurohypophysis who underwent surgery at Toranomon Hospital between January 2007 and March 2017. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and radiologic data for these patients.
   RESULTS: The patient cohort comprised 5 men and 3 women, with a mean age of 57 years. The presenting symptoms included visual disturbance in 7 patients and anterior pituitary dysfunction in 7 patients. No patient had diabetes insipidus (DI). Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a thick anterior pituitary gland located anterior to the tumor in 3 patients and flow voids on T2-weighted images in 6 patients. All patients under-went transsphenoidal surgery, and gross total resection was achieved in 4 patients. Postoperative morbidities included deterioration of anterior pituitary function in 4 patients and permanent DI in 3 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Anterior displacement of a thick anterior pituitary by a tumor combined with evidence of flow voids on preoperative MRI is helpful in the preoperative diagnosis of LGG of the neurohypophysis. Radical resection should be attempted in these tumors, especially during primary surgery, even though it is associated with postoperative pituitary dysfunction.

AB INTRODUCTION: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), particularly Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is an established treatment option for residual and recurrent pituitary adenoma tumors. It helps in the preservation of surrounding normal neuronal, vascular, and hormone-producing structures and causes fewer neurologic deficits. The aim of this research was to evaluate the efficacy and define the role of GKRS in the treatment of nonfunctioning (NFA) and hormonal active (HAA) pituitary adenoma.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 111 patients with histologically proven pituitary adenoma who underwent GKRS treatment at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, Louisiana, USA, over a 17-year period was conducted presented. The clinical and radiologic data were collected from the database. The tumors were categorized into NFA and HAA based on the endocrinology profile. The relevant statistical analysis was conducted with SPSS software, version 22.0.
   RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 58 years. The study comprised 87 patients with NFA and 24 patients with HAA tumors. Thirty-eight patients (34.2%) had hypopituitarism symptoms, and 8 patients (7%) had panhypopituitarism symptoms. The mean tumor volume before to GKRS was 3.8 cm(3). Suprasellar and cavernous extension of the tumor was noted in 28 patients (25.2%) and 34 (30.6%) patients, respectively. We observed > 70% reduction in the size of tumors in the shrinkage cohort after GKRS; the median time for shrinkage was 48.4 months. However, increase in tumor size was noted in the progression cohort (pre-GKRS 3.8 cm(3) vs. post-GKRS 6.5 cm(3)). Seventy patients (63.1%) had neurologic improvement, and 26 patients (23.4%) had endocrinologic worsening after GKRS.
   CONCLUSIONS: GKRS plays a significant role in the treatment of NFA and HAA. It affords a high rate of tumor control and offers a low risk of collateral neurologic or endocrine axis injury. Our study shows that control of tumor growth was achieved in 90% of patients, shrinkage of tumor in 54%, and arrest of progression in 36% after GKRS treatment. The biochemical remission rate in growth hormone secreting adenoma was 57%, in adrenocorticotropic hormone adenoma 67%, and prolactinoma 40%. Age below 50 years and tumor volume less than 5 cm(3) were associated with a favorable radiosurgical outcome.

AB BACKGROUND: Immediate microsurgical nerve suture remains the gold standard after peripheral nerve injuries. However, functional recovery is delayed, and it is satisfactory in only 2/3 of cases. Peripheral electrical nerve stimulation proximal to the lesion enhances nerve regeneration and muscle reinnervation. This study aims to evaluate the effects of the motor cortex electrical stimulation on peripheral nerve regeneration after injury.
   METHODS: Eighty rats underwent right sciatic nerve section, followed by immediate microsurgical epineural sutures. Rats were divided into 4 groups: Group 1 (control, n = 20): no electrical stimulation; group 2 (n = 20): immediate stimulation of the sciatic nerve just proximal to the lesion; Group 3 (n = 20): motor cortex stimulation (MCS) for 15 minutes after nerve section and suture (MCSa); group 4 (n = 20): MCS performed over the course of two weeks after nerve suture (MCSc). Assessment included electrophysiology and motor functional score at day 0 (baseline value before nerve section), and at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Rats were euthanized for histological study at week 12.
   RESULTS: Our results showed that MCS enhances functional recovery, nerve regeneration, and muscle reinnervation starting week 4 compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The MCS induces higher reinnervation rates even compared with peripheral stimulation, with better results in the MCSa group (P < 0.05), especially in terms of functional recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS: MCS seems to have a beneficial effect after peripheral nerve injury and repair in terms of nerve regeneration and muscle reinnervation, especially when acute mode is used.

AB BACKGROUND: External ventricular drainage (EVD) catheter placement is one of the most commonly performed neurosurgical procedures. The study's objective was to compare a computed tomography (CT) bolt scan-guided approach for the placement of EVDs with conventional landmark-based insertion.
   METHODS: In this retrospective case-control study, we analyzed patients undergoing bolt-kit EVD catheter placement, either CT-guided or landmark-based, between 2013 and 2016. The CT bolt scan-guided approach was based on a dose-reduced CT scan after bolt fixation with immediate image reconstruction along the axis of the bolt to evaluate the putative insertion axis. If needed, angulation of the bolt was corrected and the procedure repeated before the catheter was inserted. Primary endpoint was the accuracy of insertion. Secondary endpoints were the overall number of attempts, duration of intervention, complication rates, and cumulative radiation dose.
   RESULTS: In total, 34 patients were included in the final analysis. In the group undergoing CT-guided placement, the average ventricle width was significantly smaller (P = 0.04) and average midline shift significantly more pronounced (P = 0.01). CT-guided placement resulted in correct positioning of the catheter in the ipsilateral frontal horn in all 100% of the cases compared with landmark-guided insertion (63%; P = 0.01). Application of the CT-guided approach increased the number of total CT scans (3.6 +/- 1.9) and the overall radiation dose (3.34 +/- 1.61 mSv) compared with the freehand insertion group (1.84 +/- 2.0 mSv and 1.55 +/- 1.66 mSv). No differences were found for the other secondary outcome parameters.
   CONCLUSIONS: CT-guided bolt-kit EVD catheter placement is feasible and accurate in the most difficult cases.

AB BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy combines the effects of a chemical agent with the physical energy from light or radiation to result in lysis of cells. Acridine orange (AO) is a molecule with fluorescence properties that has been demonstrated to possess photosensitizing properties. The objective of this study was to investigate the photodynamic effect of AO on glioblastoma cell viability and growth.
   METHODS: Glioblastoma cells (N = 8000 cells/well at 0 hours) were exposed to AO followed by white unfiltered light-emitting diode light. Cultures were exposed to either 10 or 30 minutes of light. The cell number per well was determined at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours after exposure.
   RESULTS: A dramatic cytocidal effect of AO after exposure to 10 minutes of white light was observed. There was almost complete eradication of glioblastoma cells over a 72-hour period. Although AO or light alone exhibited some effect on cell growth, it was not as pronounced as the combination of AO and light.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to our knowledge to demonstrate the photodynamic effect of AO in glioblastoma cells. These data support the need for further studies to characterize and evaluate whether this striking cytotoxic effect can be achieved in vivo. The combination of AO and exposure to white unfiltered light-emitting diode light may have potential future applications in management of glioblastoma.

AB OBJECTIVE: Preserving the ligamentum flavum (LF) during lumbar spine surgery can help to limit the extent of postoperative epidural fibrosis (EF), which is a potential cause of persistent leg pain. We present a retrospective analysis of microdiscectomy with preservation of the LF to evaluate the effects of the two LF mobilizing techniques (reflecting inferiorly or medially vs. removing completely) on EF and clinical outcomes.
   METHODS: Microdiscectomy was performed through a unilateral laminotomy in 93 patients (52 male, 41 female; mean age, 46 years; range, 25-65 years) with L3-L4 (n = 3), L4-L5 (n = 40), and L5-S1 (n = 50) lumbar disc herniation. Patients whose LF was removed were assigned to group 1 (n = 42), and patients whose LF was preserved by mobilizing it medially (n = 31) or inferiorly (n = 20) were assigned to groups 2 and 3, respectively. Follow-up visual analog scale (VAS) scores and magnetic resonance images were evaluated.
   RESULTS: EF scores, particularly for the anterior quadrants, were significantly higher in group 1 than in groups 2 (P = 0.012) and 3 (P = 0.001). Likewise, postoperative VAS scores in group 1 were also significantly higher than in groups 2 (P = 0.009) and 3 (P = 0.044).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that 1) preserving the LF during lumbar microdiscectomy reduces the formation of postoperative EF and improves clinical outcomes; 2) EF in the anterior, rather than the posterior epidural space, is correlated with clinical results; and 3) the ligament mobilizing technique used should be individually tailored on the basis of the features of disc herniation.

TI Headache Outcomes After Coil Embolization in Patients with Unruptured
   Intracranial Aneurysms: Do They Get Better or Worse? A Prospective
   Analysis

AB BACKGROUND: To investigate the association between headache outcomes and coil embolization and to identify potential factors associated with different headache outcomes in patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UlAs) after treatment with coil embolization.
   METHODS: A prospective study of patients with planned coil embolization for UIAs was conducted. The changes in headache patterns, headache-related disability, and depression were assessed before coil embolization and at 3 days and 2 and 6 weeks after coil embolization. All variables were analyzed to identify factors associated with different headache outcomes.
   RESULTS: Fifty-nine (72%) of 82 patients reported headaches before coil embolization. Of these, improvements in the severity of headaches were reported by 42 patients (71%). In addition to a significant reduction in headache severity, significant reductions in headache-related disability and depression scores also were observed. Demographic factors, aneurysmal characteristics, or procedural factors were not found to be significantly associated with improvement in the severity of headaches after coil embolization. In addition, the number of microemboli on diffusion-weighted imaging was not significantly associated with improvement of headaches after coil embolization.
   Twenty-three patients reported no headaches before coil embolization, and 3 (13%) patients reported new-onset headaches after coil embolization. All new-onset headaches were mild and dull in nature without combined symptoms in the temporal area.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that regardless of headache characteristics, the aneurysm size (even those <5 mm in diameter), technique used (stent-assisted or not stent-assisted), and coil embolization of UIAs resulted in headache improvement in most patients with pretreatment headaches.

AB OBJECTIVE: Fever is relatively common and worsens neurologic injury after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemor-rhage (SAH). The aim of this study was to display the time course of body temperature, identify predictive factors of fever after SAH, and evaluate its impact on delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and clinical outcomes.
   METHODS: Four hundred twelve patients with SAH and ruptured aneurysms who were treated at our institution between January 2007 and December 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. The febrile group was defined as patients having a maximal temperature >= 38.0 degrees C for 2 consecutive days or for more than 3 days within 2 weeks after SAH, and the remaining patients comprised the afebrile group. The impact of fever on DCI and clinical outcomes was assessed.
   RESULTS: Anterior communicating artery aneurysm, Hunt and Hess grade, SAH sum score, intraventricular hemorrhage sum score, and body mass index were independent predictive factors for fever after SAH. A larger SAH and fever were independent risk factors for DCI. A worse Hunt and Hess grade, concomitant intracerebral hemorrhage, DCI, old age, and fever were independent risk factors for unfavorable outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Predictors of fever after SAH were a worse clinical status at admission, larger SAH and intraventricular hemorrhage, anterior communicating artery aneurysm, and greater body mass index. Fever itself was an independent risk factor for DCI and unfavorable outcomes after aneurysmal SAH.

AB OBJECTIVE: Intraprocedural rupture (IPR) during endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysm is the most feared complication, with high morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence and risk factors of IPR during endovascular treatment of ruptured and unruptured cerebral aneurysms.
   METHODS: A total of 235 intracranial aneurysms (80 ruptured and 155 unruptured) in 219 patients who received endovascular treatment in our institution between January 2010 and December 2016 were enrolled in our study. Demographic and radiologic data were analyzed to evaluate risk factors of IPR. We conducted a literature review to estimate the incidence of IPR according to rupture status and aneurysm location.
   RESULTS: Ten patients (6 ruptured, 4 unruptured) experienced IPR during endovascular treatment. The IPR incidence was 7.5% in ruptured and 2.5% in unruptured aneurysms. Aneurysm size (smaller than 3.58 mm) and anterior communicating artery aneurysm were independent risk factors for IPR. According to the literature review, the overall IPR incidence was 4.47% (393/8791) in ruptured and 1.43% (145/10,131) in unruptured aneurysms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Independent risk factors for IPR during endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysm were aneurysm size and anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Ruptured aneurysms showed a higher tendency toward IPR than did unruptured aneurysms.

   VALIDATION; IMBALANCE; TILT
AB BACKGROUND: Previous studies have built a foundation for understanding compensation in patients with adult spinal deformity (ASD) by using full-body stereographic assessments. These mechanisms, in relation to ageadjusted alignment targets, have yet to be studied fully. The aim of this study was to assess lower-limb compensatory mechanisms of patients failing to meet age-adjusted alignment goals.
   METHODS: Patients with ASD >= 40 years with full body baseline and follow-up radiographs were included. Patients were stratified by age (40-65 years, >65 years) and spinopelvic correction. Lower-limb compensation parameters (pelvic shift, hip extension, knee flexion [KA], ankle flexion [AA], and global sagittal angle [GSA]) for patients who matched and failed to match age-adjusted alignment targets were compared with analysis of variance and t-test analysis.
   RESULTS: In total, 108 patients were included. At 1 year, AA increased with age in the "match" pelvic tilt (PT) and spinopelvic mismatch (PI-LL) cohorts (PT: AA, 5.6-7.8, P = 0.041; PI-LL: 4.9-8.8, P = 0.026). KA, AA, and GSA increased with age in the "match" sagittal vertical axis (SVA) cohort (KA: 3.8-13.1, P = 0.002; AA: 5.8-10.2, P = 0.008; GSA: 3.9-7.8, P < 0.001), as did KA and GSA in the "match" T1 pelvic angle group (KA: 1.8-8.7, P = 0.020; GSA: 2.6-5.7, P = 0.004).
   CONCLUSIONS: Greater compensation captured by KA and GSA was associated with age progression in the "match" SVA and T1 pelvic angle cohorts. In addition, older SVA, PT, and PI-LL "match" cohorts used increased AA, suggesting that ideal postoperative alignment of aged individuals with ASD involves increased compensation.

AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment of previously clipped aneurysms have not been well-established. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the outcomes of endovascular treatment of previously clipped aneurysms.
   METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and the Web of Science was performed for studies published until October 2017. We included studies with >= 2 patients that described endovascular treatment of previously clipped aneurysms. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool the following outcomes: technical success, aneurysm occlusion/recurrence/rebleed, ischemic/thrombotic/thromboembolic events, neurologic/procedurerelated morbidity/mortality, and favorable neurologic outcomes. We performed subgroup analyses by aneurysm rupture status on presentation to the endovascular procedure, treatment timing, and by aneurysm location (anterior vs. posterior circulation).
   RESULTS: In total, 27 studies with 271 patients were included. Overall complete occlusion was 76.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.676-0.836) and technical success was 97.9% (95% CI 0.958-0.993). Combined procedurerelated morbidity/mortality was 4.5% (95% CI 0.024-0.073). There were no statistically significant differences in any of the safety and efficacy outcomes by aneurysm location. Overall long-term favorable neurologic outcome was 78.5% (95% CI 0.732-0.834). All included studies are retrospective.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis demonstrated that endovascular treatment is acceptably safe and effective. It is important to point out that the complication rate of treatment of these aneurysms is not negligible. These findings should be considered when deciding the best therapeutic strategy. Our findings may suggest that endovascular treatment of previously clipped aneurysms should only be considered in circumstances in which conservative management seems to be unsafe.

AB PURPOSE: To explore accuracy and clinical efficacy of a novel patient-specific three-dimensional (3D) printed drill navigational guiding template in atlantoaxial pedicle screw placement.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 49 patients with atlantoaxial vertebral fractures and dislocations was performed. Patients were divided into a 3D printed navigational guiding template group (n = 25) and traditional group (n = 14). Safety of screw position was assessed, and accuracy of 2 screw placement methods was compared. Accuracy of screw placement was assessed by comparing differences between preoperative designed channel transverse angle and postoperative actual screw placement angle. Two groups were compared to find differences between operative time, intraoperative blood loss, screw placement time, number of fluoroscopy examinations, visual analog scale score, and Japanese Orthopaedic Association score.
   RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences between the guiding template group and traditional group in operative time, intraoperative blood loss, screw placement time, and number of fluoroscopy examinations. No statistically significant differences were found between groups in transverse and sagittal angles with ideal values. There were statistically significant differences between preoperative and 1-week, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year postoperative visual analog scale and Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores in the same group, whereas there were no statistically significant differences between the groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Use of the novel patient-specific 3D printed drill navigational guiding template in surgical treatment of atlantoaxial fracture and dislocation can improve accuracy of pedicle screw placement and safety of the surgery, can reduce surgical risks, and can obtain satisfactory clinical curative effects.

ID HEAD-INJURY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ACCIDENTS; IMPACT
AB BACKGROUND: Road traffic incidents (RTIs), falls, and violence contribute to more than two thirds of pediatric traumatic brain injuries in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we sought to assess mechanisms of pediatric traumatic brain injury in an effort to propose interventions for more effective pediatric head injury prevention.
   METHODS: A cohort of 100 patients who were <18 years treated at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital between November 2016 and June 2017 were enrolled in the study. Information on etiology of injury was obtained via a questionnaire administered to patient caretakers at the time of admission.
   RESULTS: The mean age was found to be 7.5 years (standard deviation 5.2) and 38% were female. In our sample, 61% had computed tomography imaging done, of whom 88.5% had a positive finding. A majority of patients presented with a mild head injury (55%). RTIs were the predominant mechanism of injury across age groups (75%). Across all age groups, falls were responsible for a greater proportion of injuries in children aged 10-14 years (13.3%), whereas the greatest proportion of intentional injuries was reported in age group 10-14 and 15-17 years, 20% and 31.3%, respectively. Patients involved in pedestrian RTIs were significantly younger compared with those injured in nonpedestrian RTIs. Most parents (87.9%) were not with their children at the time of a pedestrian RTI.
   CONCLUSIONS: In Southwestern Uganda, the majority of pediatric neurotrauma patients are injured pedestrians, with no adult supervision at the time of the injury. Conducting a public awareness and education campaign on the necessity of child supervision is critical to decreasing pediatric head injuries in Uganda.

AB BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma spinal involvement can lead to bone fractures and neurologic impairment that can severely alter quality of life. The role of surgery is controversial, given its high morbidity, and the lack of evidence. We hereby aim to evaluate efficacy and safety of surgery in the management of symptomatic spinal lesions in patients with multiple myeloma.
   METHODS: We included all patients operated on for a myeloma-related spinal lesion in our institution between 2007 and 2015. Demographic, clinical, and surgical data were collected as well as hematologic profiles. We retrospectively assessed the surgical success of the procedures, if at 3 months the patient fulfilled the following 4 criteria: pain relief, ability to walk, spinal stability, and no relevant morbidity.
   RESULTS: Thirty-six men and 19 women, with a median age of 62 years, were included. Seventeen patients underwent an emergency intervention, whereas 38 patients underwent elective surgery. At 3 months, 88.2% and 96.1%, respectively, of patients experienced pain relief and were able to walk. Spinal stability was considered satisfactory for 94.1% of patients. We reported 8 major complications in 8 patients. Altogether, 34 patients (61.8%) fulfilled all criteria for surgical success. An International Staging System score of 1 and the absence of previous chemotherapy were significantly associated with surgical success.
   CONCLUSIONS: Management of myeloma-related spine lesions requires amultidisciplinary approach. Surgery rapidly provides both decompression and stabilization. Using a strict patient-specific evaluation, we reported rewarding functional results, with acceptable morbidity. Surgery for multiple myeloma vertebral lesions seems to be a valuable option for carefully selected patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: Surgeon volume has been previously shown to affect patient outcomes. However, data related to neurooncologic surgery are limited and do not include neurologic morbidities as an outcomes measure. In this study, we aimed to determine if 5-year surgeon cumulative and annual volumes predict early postoperative outcomes in patients after brain tumor surgery.
   METHODS: A population-based cohort of patients (n = 10,258) undergoing brain tumor resection between 2005 and 2014 were included for study using the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperation System. Surgeons were categorized by their cumulative and annual surgical volume.
   RESULTS: Patients treated by high cumulative/high annual (HC/HA) volume surgeons had shorter length of stay (median, 5 days vs. 8 days vs. 8 days vs. 6 days, respectively; P < 0.01), lower charges (median, 70,025 vs. $77,043 vs. $93,715 vs. $77,018 respectively; P < 0.01) and less nonroutine discharge (41% vs. 48% vs. 50.9% vs. 43.9% respectively; P < 0.01) compared with patients treated by surgeons from the low cumulative/low annual (LC/LA), LC/HA, HC/LA groups. Similarly, HC/HA volume surgeons also had lower rate of hydrocephalus (9.9% vs. 10.4% vs. 13.7% respectively; P [ 0.02), medical complications (6.9% vs. 11.2% vs. 11.5% respectively; P < 0.01), neurologic complications (44.1% vs. 46.8% vs. 48.1% respectively; P = 0.03), 30-day reoperation (5.1% vs. 6.9% vs. 7.1% respectively; P < 0.01) and 30-day death (3.3% vs. 5.4% vs. 5.2%; P < 0.01) compared with LC/LA and LC/HA volume surgeons.
   CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence for improved postoperative outcomes when surgery is performed by HC and HA volume surgeons. This finding suggests that subspecialization in surgical neuro-oncology should be considered.

ID COMA SCALE SCORE; INTOXICATION; MODERATE; PATIENT; BURDEN
AB BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury associated with alcohol consumption is a global public health problem. It is important to identify and rethink the strategies to approach this challenge for health care institutions from a professional perspective.
   METHODS: An online survey, created with Google Forms, was sent to professional neurosurgeons in Mexico and Latin America. Participation was voluntary, and responses were anonymous and confidential. Data were captured after 1 month and subjected to descriptive statistical analysis using Fisher exact and chi(2) tests.
   RESULTS: There were 83 questionnaires answered by certified neurosurgeons with a response rate of 52.9%. Responses indicated that 78% of hospitals have no specific management guidelines for patients with TBI and alcohol intoxication. In 90% of cases, no triage strategies are defined for the case, and at hospital admission, there are no specific identified strategies for extraordinary surveillance of risks in these patients (P = 0.062).
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm a lack of systematic strategies for management of patients with TBI and associated comorbidity of alcohol intoxication in the acute phase. It is important to define specific management guidelines to improve treatment efficacy and limit complications inn patients with TBI and alcohol intoxication.

AB BACKGROUND: Plurihormonal adenomas (PHAs) represent 10%-15% of all functioning pituitary adenomas. The most frequent hormonal associations are with prolactin and growth hormone (GH). Here we describe a rare case of functional adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and GH microadenoma and report our findings from a systematic literature review of PHA.
   METHODS: We searched PubMed using the terms "plurihormonal pituitary adenoma," "ACTH GH pituitary adenoma," and "acromegaly AND Cushing's disease". In the 17 articles that were selected for literature review, only 20% (4/20) of patients presented with clinical signs of both diseases. Histologically, 19 were pituitary adenomas composed of two distinct cell populations, while only in 1 case was there evidence of a single cell producing both ACTH and GH. In the case reported here, a 60-year-old woman was incidentally diagnosed with a pituitary microadenoma. Endocrine assessment documented increased levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 and GH; ACTH and cortisol values were within normal ranges. Echocardiography documented ventricular hypertrophy. Because of clinical and biochemical evidence of acromegaly, surgery was recommended. Postoperatively, hormonal replacement therapy was started because of adrenal insufficiency. Her antihypertensive therapy was discontinued due to evidence of normal blood pressure values. Histological examination revealed an ACTH-GH PHA with 2 distinct populations of secreting cells. At 3-year follow-up, the patient showed stable clinical remission and was no longer receiving hormonal replacement therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is an additional case to the 20 previously reported cases of ACTH-GH PHA. Awareness of this relatively rare entity is clinically relevant. The cytogenesis of ACTH-GH PHA remains a matter of debate, and several hypotheses have been postulated.

   NEURONAVIGATION; COMMISSION; EXPERIENCE; MORTALITY
AB BACKGROUND: Temporal lobe resection (TIM) including amygdalohippocampectomy (AHE) is the most frequent performed procedure in epilepsy surgery. Owing to the close anatomic relationship of the mesial temporal structures and the midbrain and choroidal fissure, the incidence of severe complications, such as postoperative stroke, is as high as 2.5%.
   METHODS: We developed a modification of the classical technique for AHE that involves entering the choroidal fissure early via the anterior part of the frontomesial temporal horn cleft to identify the crux cerebri, posterior cerebri artery, and oculomotor nerve. In a second step, after visualization of the cleavage plane between the midbrain and middle cerebral artery, the uncus and amygdala are removed.
   RESULTS: A total of 01 patients (47 females and 34 males; mean age at surgery, 40 years) underwent TLR including AHE with our surgical modification to treat heterogeneous pathologies. The cohort included 45 patients with hippocampal sclerosis, 11 with ganglioglioma, 2 with dysembryoplastic neuroepithelioma, 2 with diffuse glioma, and 21 with other pathologies, including cavernoma, scar tissue, and mild cortical dysplasia, among others. In all patients, anterior temporal resection was performed via AHE using our modified technique. Seizure outcome was favorable after a mean follow-up of 27 months (range, 3 56 months); 64% of the patients were completely seizure-free (Engel class 1A), and 75% had an Engel class 1 outcome. There was no mortality or permanent severe neurologic complications, and the rate of surgical complications was 3.7%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our modified AHE technique is associated with a low rate of complications in TLR for medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy, and helps avoid permanent severe neurologic complications.

ID NONMISSILE INJURIES; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Compound depressed skull fracture (DSF) is a neurosurgical emergency. Preoperative knowledge of dural status is indispensable for treatment decision making. This study aimed to determine predictors of dural tear from clinical and imaging characteristics in patients with compound DSF.
   METHODS: This prospective, multicenter correlational study in neurosurgical hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, included 128 patients operated on from January 1, 2016, to October 31, 2016. Clinical, imaging, and intraoperative findings were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to establish predictors of dural tear. A logistic regression model was developed to predict probability of dural tear. Model validation was done using the receiver operating characteristic curve.
   RESULTS: Dural tear was seen in 55.5% of 128 patients. Demographics, injury mechanism, clinical presentation, and site of DSF had no significant correlation with dural tear. In univariate and multivariate analyses, depth of fracture depression (odds ratio 1.3, P < 0.001), pneumocephalus (odds ratio 2.8, P = 0.005), and brain contusions/intracerebral hematoma (odds ratio 5.5, P < 0.001) were significantly correlated with dural tear. We developed a logistic regression model (diagnostic test) to calculate probability of dural tear. Using the receiver operating characteristic curve, we determined the cutoff value for a positive test giving the highest accuracy to be 30% with a corresponding sensitivity of 93.0% and specificity of 43.9%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Dural tear in compound DSF can be predicted with 93.0% sensitivity using preoperative findings and may guide treatment decision making in resource-limited settings where risk of extensive cranial surgery outweighs the benefit.

AB BACKGROUND: Epidural tumors in the lumbar spine represent a unique cohort of lesions with individual risks and challenges to resection. Knowledge of modifiable risk factors are important in minimizing postoperative complications.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors for 30-day morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing extradural lumbar tumor resection.
   METHODS: A retrospective study of prospectively collected data using the American College of Surgeons National Quality Improvement Program database was performed. Adults who underwent laminectomy for excision of lumbar spine tumors between 2011 and 2014 were included in the study. Demographics and medical comorbidities were collected, along with morbidities and mortalities within 30 postoperative days. A multivariate binary logistic analysis of these clinical variables was performed to determine covariates of morbidity and mortality.
   RESULTS: The database search yielded 300 patients, of whom 118 (39.3%) were female. Overall, complications within 30 days of surgery occurred in 102 (34%) patients. Significant risk factors for morbidity included preoperative anemia (P < 0.0001), the need for preoperative blood transfusion (P = 0.034), preoperative hypoalbuminemia (P = 0.002), American Society of Anesthesiologists score 3 or 4 (P = 0.0002), and operative time >4 hours (P < 0.0001). Thirty-day mortality occurred in 15 (5%) patients and was independently associated with preoperative anemia (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.8-6.5) and operative time >4 hours (odds ratio 2.6, 95% confidence interval 1.1-6.0).
   CONCLUSIONS: Excision of epidural lumbar spinal tumors carries a relatively high complication rate. This series reveals distinct risk factors that contribute to 30-day morbidity and mortality, which may be optimized preoperatively to improve surgical safety.

AB BACKGROUND: Data on traumatic intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) are currently limited, and therefore, the condition is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiology of traumatic IVH and its effects on outcome in patients with blunt head trauma.
   METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using a nationwide trauma registry-the Japan Trauma Data Bank, we identified patients who underwent head computed tomography (CT) after blunt head trauma and had intracranial injuries between 2004 and 2015. The endpoint was in-hospital mortality. We compared patients with IVH and without IVH and adjusted for potential confounders using a multivariate logistic regression model.
   RESULTS: A total of 236,698 patients were registered in the database. Of the 139,058 patients who underwent head CT after blunt trauma, 906 (0.7%) had traumatic IVH. Among the 53,618 patients who were eligible for analysis, 871 had IVH. Traumatic IVH was associated with the occurrence of traffic accidents that caused trauma and severe injuries. Mortality was significantly higher in patients with IVH than in those without IVH (33.5% vs. 18.5%; P < 0.001); however, the difference was not significant after adjusting for confounding factors, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.13 (95% confidence interval: 0.91-1.40).
   CONCLUSIONS: Traumatic IVH is associated with a high mortality. However, the outcome in patients with traumatic IVH was worse than that in patients without IVH, which could be a result of factors associated with IVH rather than of IVH alone.

AB OBJECTIVE: Transforaminal endoscopic treatment has been reported to be an effective treatment option in patients with lumbar disc herniation. However, it is rarely performed for spinal stenosis because of the limitation of endoscopic working mobility caused by the exiting nerve root and foraminous bony structure. The objective of this study was to describe a novel transforaminal endoscopic decompression technique for spinal stenosis and report the clinical results.
   METHODS: From October 2015 to October 2016, 30 consecutive cases were diagnosed as lateral recess stenosis in our institution and underwent transforaminal endoscopic decompression. Visual analog scale (VAS) of back and leg pain and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were measured preoperatively and at follow-up.
   RESULTS: The mean +/- SD value of preoperative VAS leg pain score was 7.6 +/- 1.17. The score improved to 2.2 +/- 1.11 at 1 week postoperatively, 1.73 +/- 0.96 at 4 weeks postoperatively, and 1.63 +/- 0.95 at 26 weeks postoperatively (P < 0.01). The mean +/- SD value of the preoperative ODI score was 65.69 +/- 14.22. The score improved to 24.29 +/- 11.89 at 1 week postoperatively, 21.25 +/- 9.25 at 4 weeks postoperatively, and 15.62 +/- 10.49 at 26 weeks postoperatively (P < 0.01). There were no patients with postoperative infection, dural tear, delayed neurologic deterioration, or conversion to open surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Transforaminal endoscopic decompression under local anesthesia could be an effective treatment method for the selected group of patients with spinal stenosis.

AB BACKGROUND: To explore the predictive parameters for adjacent segment disease (ASD) after anterior cervical arthrodesis at the sagittal measurement of thoracic inlet.
   METHODS: We included 212 subjects treated with anterior cervical fusion surgery to identify predictive parameters for ASD. We applied multivariate logistic regression to find the relevant parameters.
   RESULTS: Two hundred patients completed the final follow-up. The results of logistic regression analysis showed that T1 slope of less than 19.50 could be a predictive parameter of ASD after the anterior cervical arthrodesis (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Sagittal balance of thoracic inlet is vital to avoid the. cervical degenerative disease, while T1 slope of less than 19.50 appears to be an independent risk factor for the ASD, keeping the T1 slope of more than 19.5 is reasonable.

AB OBJECTIVE: Recently developed expandable interbody spacers are widely accepted in spinal surgery; however, the resulting biomechanical effects of their use have not yet been fully studied. We analyzed the biomechanical effects of an expandable polyetheretherketone interbody spacer inserted through a bilateral posterior approach with and without different modalities of posterior augmentation.
   METHODS: Biomechanical nondestructive flexibility testing was performed in 7 human cadaveric lumbar (L2-L5) specimens followed by axial compressive loading. Each specimen was tested under 6 conditions: 1) intact, 2) bilateral L3-L4 cortical screw/rod (CSR) alone, 3) WaveD alone, 4) WaveD + CSR, 5) WaveD + bilateral L3-L4 pedicle screw/rod (PSR), and 6) WaveD + CSR/PSR, where CSR/PSR was a hybrid construct comprising bilateral cortical-level L3 and pedicle-level L4 screws interconnected by rods.
   RESULTS: The range of motion (ROM) with the interbody spacer alone decreased significantly compared with the intact condition during flexioneextension (P = 0.02) but not during lateral bending or axial rotation (P >= 0.19). The addition of CSR or PSR to the interbody spacer alone condition significantly decreased the ROM compared with the interbody spacer alone (P <= 0.002); and WaveD + CSR, WaveD + PSR, and WaveD + CSR/PSR (hybrid) (P >= 0.29) did not differ. The axial compressive stiffness (resistance to change in foraminal height during compressive loading) with the interbody spacer alone did not differ from the intact condition (P = 0.96), whereas WaveD + posterior instrumentation significantly increased compressive stiffness compared with the intact condition and the interbody spacer alone (P <= 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: The WaveD alone significantly reduced ROM during flexioneextension while maintaining the axial compressive stiffness. CSR, PSR, and CSR/PSR hybrid constructs were all effective in augmenting the expandable interbody spacer system and improving its stability.

   EXPOSURE; SURGERY; STRATEGIES
AB OBJECTIVE: The cervical carotid segment is used routinely as donor site for high-flow bypass procedures. The horizontal petrous segment would offer a shorter graft distance, complete graft protection intracranially, and avoid the need for surgical neck exposure. In a morpho-metric cadaveric study, we aimed to investigate variations of the petrous carotid anatomy, especially the incidence of bony dehiscence of the roof of the horizontal petrous carotid segment canal, which may facilitate exposure of the vessel and thereby potentially lower the morbidity of high-flow bypass procedures.
   METHODS: A subtemporal approach was used to expose the horizontal petrous internal carotid artery (ICA) on each side of 4 alcohol-embedded, silicone-injected human cadaver heads to perform a morphometric analysis of the vessel segment and surrounding bony anatomy.
   RESULTS: The following measurements were obtained of the horizontal petrous ICA (millimeters): long axis mean 9.6 (standard deviation [SD] 4.4, MIN 4.2, MAX 19.5), diameter mean 4.9 (SD 0.6, MIN 4, MAX 5.7), thickness of canal roof mean 2.1 (SD 1.7, MIN 0, MAX 5), and distance from temporal squama mean 22.5 (SD 6, MIN 17, MAX 35). Dehiscence of the bony roof of the horizontal petrous carotid canal was found in 25% of specimen investigated.
   CONCLUSIONS: A dehiscent bony roof of the horizontal petrous carotid canal potentially facilitates exposure of the vessel for high-flow bypass procedures and was observed in 25% of specimens. This feature could be identified on preoperative high-resolution imaging and thus aid in patient selection.

AB BACKGROUND: Cranioplasties are an important neurosurgical procedure not only for improved cosmesis but also for improved functional recovery after craniectomy with a large cranial defect. The aim of this study was to identify predictive factors of postcranioplasty complications using custom-made porous hydroxyapatite cranioplasty.
   METHODS: Retrospective review was performed of all patients who underwent a reconstructive cranioplasty using custom-made hydroxyapatite at our institution between February 2008 and September 2017. Postoperative complications considered included bacterial infection, seizures, hydrocephalus requiring ventricular shunt placement, and cranioplasty-to-bone shift. Variables associated at P < 0.1 level in unadjusted analysis were entered into backward stepwise logistic regression models.
   RESULTS: Of 109 patients included, 15 (13.8%) experienced postoperative infection, with craniectomy performed at an outside institution (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 10.37 [95% confidence interval [CI], 2.03-75.27], P [0.012) and a previous infection at the surgical site (adjusted OR 6.15 [95% CI, 1.90-19.92], P[0.003) identified as independent predictors. Six patients (5.5%) experienced postoperative seizures, with stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) as a reason for craniectomy (adjusted OR 11.68 [95% CI, 2.56-24.13], P < 0.001) and the presence of seizures in the month before cranioplasty (adjusted OR 9.39 [95% CI, 2.04-127.67], P = 0.002) identified as independent predictors. Four patients (3.7%) experienced postcranioplasty hydrocephalus necessitating shunt placement, and 5 patients (4.6%) experienced cranioplasty-to-bone shift >= 5 mm, but no significant predictive factors were identified for either complication.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study identified possible predictive factors for postcranioplasty complications to help identify at-risk patients, guide prophylactic care, and improve morbidity of this important surgical procedure.

AB OBJECTIVE: To probe the relationship among cement volume/fraction, imaging features of cement distribution, and pain relief and then to evaluate the optimal volume during percutaneous vertebroplasty.
   METHODS: From January 2014 to January 2017, a total of 130 patients eligible for inclusion criteria were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. According to the different degrees of pain relief, cement leakage, andcement distribution, all patients were allocated to 2 groups. Clinical and radiologic characteristics were assessed to identify independent factors influencing pain relief, cement leakage, and cement distribution, including age, sex, fracture age, bone mineral density, operation time, fracture level, fracture type, modified semiquantitative severity grade, intravertebral cleft, cortical disruption in the vertebral wall, endplate disruption, type of nutrient foramen, fractured vertebral body volume, intravertebral cement volume, and volume fraction. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to analyze the diagnostic value of the cement volume/fraction and then to obtain the optional cut-off value.
   RESULTS: The preoperative visual analog scale scores in the responders versus nonresponders patient groups were 7.37 +/- 0.61 versus 7.87 +/- 0.92 and the postoperative VAS scores in the responders versus nonresponders were 2.04 +/- 0.61 versus 4.33 +/- 0.49 at 1 week. There were no independent factors influencing pain relief. There were 95 (73.08%) patients who experienced cement leakage, and cortical disruption in the vertebral wall and cement fraction percentage were identified as independent risk factors by binary logistic regression analysis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.935, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.214-7.092, P = 0.017); (adjusted OR 1.134, 95% CI 1.026-1.254, P = 0.014). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of volume fraction (VF%) was 0.658 (95% CI 0.549-0.768, P = 0.006 < 0.05). The cutoff value of VF% for cement leakage was 21.545%, with a sensitivity of 69.50% and a specificity of 60.00%. The incidence of favorable cement distribution was 74.62% (97/130), and VF% were identified as independent protective factors (adjusted OR 1.185, 95% CI 1.067-1.317, P = 0.002) The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of VF% was 0.686 (95% CI 0.571-0.802, P = 0.001 < 0.05). The cut-off value of VF% to reach a favorable cement distribution was 19.78%, with a sensitivity of 86.60% and a specificity of 51.50%.
   CONCLUSIONS: In osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture with mild/moderate fracture severity at the single thoracolumbar level, the intravertebral cement volume of 4-6 mL could relieve pain rapidly. The optimal VF% was 19.78%, which could achieve satisfactory cement distribution. With the increase of VF%, the incidence of cement leakage would also increase.

AB OBJECTIVE: Positional vertebral artery occlusion (PVAO) has a fundamental problem in the definition. We analyzed the long-term outcomes with a redefinition of the rare clinical entities as PVAO for a broader conceptualization, and discuss the efficacy of fusion surgery as a treatment option.
   METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and radiologic characteristics and outcomes in 8 patients with PVAO who experienced cerebral ischemia during a 10-year period at our institution. The follow-up periods ranged from 60 to 132 months (mean, 93.5 months). All patients were initially treated conservatively with external fixation. If spinal instability was observed at the initial evaluation or a second stroke occurred during conservative treatment, cervical spinal fusion was performed with special consideration for vertebral artery dominance and the presence of its collateral flow regardless of the type of stroke.
   RESULTS: Conservative therapy was completed for 2 patients, and spinal fusion was performed for the other 6 patients. None of the patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms after discharge until the final follow- up visit, and the outcomes were excellent. Long-term functional outcomes were dependent on the patient's condition before the onset of stroke and the neurologic deficits resulting from the initial or recurrent stroke induced by embolism.
   CONCLUSIONS: We report our single-center experience with PVAO in which 75% of patients had embolic stroke. Because embolic stroke may have a greater risk of recurrence affecting the long-term outcomes, it should be prevented. In addition, if surgical intervention is necessary, spinal fusion surgery may be an effective option.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of and risk factors for postoperative delirium (POD) after deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery in patients with Parkinson disease.
   METHODS: We analyzed the preoperative T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data of 71 patients with Parkinson disease who underwent DBS surgery. Multiple regression analysis was performed with age, L-dopa equivalent daily dose, laterality of the surgery, target regions, number of electrode trajectories tried, gray matter volume, and white matter (WM) volume as explanatory variables and the duration (number of days) of POD as the response variable. In addition, regional brain atrophy associated with POD was investigated by means of voxel-based morphometry.
   RESULTS: Excluding patients with outliers, 61 patients were included in the analyses. POD had occurred in 26 of the 61 patients (42.6%). Age and total WM volume were shown by multiple regression analysis to correlate significantly with the duration of POD (P < 0.05 and < 0.01, respectively). WM was significantly reduced in the temporal stem, and the reduction in volume correlated significantly with the duration of POD (P < 0.001). Gray matter atrophy was not associated with POD.
   CONCLUSIONS: We found that age and WM atrophy in the temporal stem are factors predictive of POD after DBS surgery. In aged patients with temporal stem atrophy, surgical procedures and postoperative management should be carefully explored to reduce the risk of postoperative delirium.

AB BACKGROUND: Superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) is a bony defect in the osseous shell of the petrous temporal bone. The pathophysiological association between osteoporosis and SSCD remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between bone metabolic markers and symptoms in patients with SSCD.
   METHODS: We collected patient demographics and clinical parameters for adult patients diagnosed with SSCD on high-resolution computed tomography scans. We used point-biserial correlation analysis to investigate the relationship between bone metabolic markers and symptoms in patients with SSCD. We compared clinical symptoms before and after surgical repair of SSCD through a middle fossa craniotomy using McNemar's test for paired comparisons of binary measures.
   RESULTS: We included a total of 99 patients (64 females and 35 males; average age 52 years; 118 surgeries). The level of serum calcium correlated with the need for a second surgery (r(pb) = -0.35, P = 0.001). Postoperative calcium supplementation negatively correlated with improvement in dizziness (r(pb) = -0.36, P = 0.01). The level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D correlated with preoperative hyperacusis (r(pb) = -0.98, P = 0.02) and postoperative autophony (r(pb) = 0.96, P = 0.04). Postoperative vitamin D supplementation positively correlated with hearing decline (r(pb) = 0.04, P = 0.04) The level of thyroid stimulating hormone correlated with preoperative autophony, amplification, and tinnitus (r(pb) = -0.71, r(pb) = -0.75, r(pb) = -0.70, all P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Bone metabolic markers could be important in the clinical assessment of SSCD patients and could be potential targets for symptom management.

AB OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the effect of preinjury antithrombotic medication on clinical and radiologic neuroworsening in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and study the effect on outcome.
   METHODS: A total of 184 consecutive patients >= 50 years old with moderate and severe TBI admitted to a level 1 trauma center were included. Neuroworsening was assessed clinically by using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and radiologically by using the Rotterdam CT score on repeated time points. Functional outcome was assessed with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended 6 months after injury.
   RESULTS: The platelet inhibitor group (mean age, 77.3 years; n = 43) and the warfarin group (mean age, 73.2 years; n = 20) were significantly older than the non-user group (mean age, 63.7 years; n = 121; P <= 0.001). In the platelet inhibitor group 74% and in the warfarin group, 85% were injured by falls, Platelet inhibitors were not significantly associated with clinical or radiologic neuroworsening (P = 0.37-1.00), whereas warfarin increased the frequency of worsening in GCS score (P = 0.001-0.028) and Rotterdam CT score (P = 0.004), In-hospital mortality was higher in the platelet inhibitor group (28%; P = 0.030) and the warfarin group (50%; P < 0.001) compared with the nonuser group (13%). Platelet inhibitors did not predict mortality or worse outcome after adjustment for age, preinjury disability, GCS score, and Rotterdam CT score, whereas warfarin predicted both mortality and worse outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this study of patients with moderate and severe TBI, preinjury platelet inhibitors did not cause neuroworsening or predict higher mortality or worse outcome. hi contrast, preinjury warfarin caused neuroworsening and was an independent risk factor for mortality and worse outcome at 6 months. Hence, fall prevention and liberal use of computed tomography examinations is important in this patient group.

DE CSF diversion; Hydrocephalus; Isolated aqueductal stenosis
ID FETAL HYDROCEPHALUS; ANTENATAL TREATMENT; CURRENT PROGNOSIS; CHILDREN
AB INTRODUCTION: Hydrocephalus due to congenital aqueductal stenosis (CAS) has significant long-term clinical implications. Previous reports on outcomes after treatment of congenital hydrocephalus are heterogenous and lack specificity for the subgroup of patients with isolated aqueductal stenosis.
   METHODS: An institutional surgical database was queried for the time period of 2005-13 for patients with the diagnosis of isolated CAS and >2 years of clinical follow-up. Medical history and neurodevelopmental outcomes were recorded.
   RESULTS: The institutional cohort consisted of 41 patients with isolated CAS who underwent cerebrospinal fluid diversion. At a mean follow-up of 5.9 years, 48.8% carried a diagnosis of epilepsy and 68% were developmentally delayed. Four patients were diagnosed with cerebral palsy (9.8%). In total, 78% of patients were shunt-dependent, and the remainder had patent third ventriculostomies. Only 32% of patients in our cohort were neurologically normal after long-term follow-up despite contemporary management.
   CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the initial treatment strategy, the age at diagnosis, or the timing of cerebrospinal fluid diversion after birth, patients with aqueductal stenosis have high rates of epilepsy, neurodevelopmental delay, and educational difficulties, and few are neurologically normal despite contemporary management. Investigation into in utero identification and correction of hydrocephalus may result in improved outcomes and warrants further investigation.

AB OBJECTIVE: A dynamic compression injury of the cervical spinal cord (SC) is widely accepted in the pathophysiology of cervical myelopathy. Flexion/extension magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides information on the dynamic cervical injury. We sought to compare morphometric parameters on neutral and flexion/extension MRI in cervical spondylotic myelopathy.
   METHODS: Patients with cervical canal stenosis who had MRI in neutral, flexion, and extension positions were reviewed retrospectively. A morphometric comparison of following parameters at compression level was performed: SC area, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) area, and CSF reserve ratio (CSF/CSF plus SC). Patients were classified according to the presence of high signal (HS) in SC, and predictors of HS were calculated by the use of logistic regression analysis. -
   RESULTS: In total, 55 patients, 26 men, with mean age of 57 +/- 13 were analyzed. Significant difference was found in mean CSF reserve ratio between flexion and extension (0.47 +/- 0.18 vs. 0.40 +/- 0.21, P < 0.05). SC area was significantly smaller in flexion (58.8 +/- 13.3 mm(2)) than in both neutral (66.9 +/- 22.3 mm(2)) and extension (68.3 +/- 19.1 mm(2)). HS was found in 22 cases, and predictors of HS were smaller SC area on extension (odds ratio 1.46; 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.84) and smaller CSF plus SC area on flexion (OR 1.32; 95% confidence interval 1.06-1.45). Cut-off values on the receiver operating characteristic curve were 55 mm(2) for SC and 99 mm(2) for CSF plus SC area.
   CONCLUSIONS: Application of dynamic MRI in cervical stenosis reveals significant differences of both SC and CSF reserve ratio in flexion/extension and neutral positions. Patients with smaller SC area in extension and smaller CSF plus SC area in flexion have greater risk of HS on MRI.

ID CLINICAL ARTICLE; MYELOMENINGOCELE; DRAINAGE; SHUNTS
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks are a dreaded complication after surgery for tethered cord and are associated with significant patient morbidity. Although many strategies for managing postoperative CSF leaks exist, this problem is still daunting, especially in very young patients. In this study, we compared different management techniques for CSF leaks or significant pseudomeningocele in patients with tethered cord syndrome (TCS).
   METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of children who underwent surgery for TCS from January 2011 to March 2016 (n = 260) and postoperatively experienced either a CSF leak or significant pseudomeningocele. A subset of patients presented with CSF leak (n = 25). We analyzed patient age, sex, presentation, leak appearance, management, and outcome. The different techniques of management were compared for efficacy and morbidity.
   RESULTS: The diseases associated with leak formation included lipomyelomeningocele (n = 16), myelocystocele (n = 4), and myelomeningocele (n = 5). Three children also had hydrocephalus. Management techniques included cystoperitoneal shunt (CPS) (n = 15), primary resuturing with local rotation flap of muscle (n = 3), external ventricular drain placement (n = 1), ventriculoperitoneal shunt (n = 3), external ventricular drainage (n = 1), and a combination of techniques (rotation flap with external drain; n = 1). Five patients who underwent primary wound revision experienced a leak and required a secondary intervention, but none of the patients who underwent CPS had any complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: In carefully selected cases, CPS performed early after CSF leakage is highly successful with low morbidity. The primary closure can be attempted for low-pressure leaks without an associated pseudomeningocele.

AB BACKGROUND: Decompression alone to treat degenerative lumbar stenosis with and without concomitant degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS; non-DS) has shown ambiguous results in the literature.
   OBJECTIVE: The aim is to compare clinical outcomes in DS and non-DS patients with lumbar stenosis who underwent decompression alone surgery without fusion on 1-3 adjacent levels after 6-month, 12-month, 24-month, and 36-month follow-up.
   METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study at 8 medical centers. The main outcomes of this study are changes in Spinal Stenosis Measure (SSM) symptoms score, SSM function score, and quality of life (EQ-5D-3L sum score) over time. Propensity score matching for DS versus non-DS was applied.
   RESULTS: One hundred seventy-seven patients met the inclusion criteria, 68 of whom had DS. In the matched cohort (n = 136), the estimated difference in SSM symptoms score of DS versus non-DS for changes from baseline to 36 months was 0.21 (95% CI, -0.15 to 0.57). For SSM function score, the estimated difference from baseline to 36 months was 0.05 (-0.21 to 0.31). Differences in changes between groups in EQ-5D-3L sum score were estimated to be -3.66 (-10.63 to 3.31) from baseline to 36 months. None of the group differences between the non-DS and the DS group was statistically significant. All matched patients improved over time in all additional outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Even after 3 years of follow-up, we show that among patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis, both groups (DS and non-DS) distinctively take advantage of decompression alone without fusion.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes between K-rod dynamic stabilization system (KDSS) and posterior lumbar intervertebral fusion (PLIF) for lumbar degenerative disease.
   METHODS: This study retrospectively reviewed 98 patients who underwent lumbar surgery from March 2012 to June 2014, including 48 in the KOSS group and 50 in the PLIF group. All patients were followed up for at least 2 years. Duration of operation, blood loss, hospital stay, complications, and patient satisfaction were recorded and analyzed. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index. Radiographic results including disk height index, foraminal height, and range of motion (ROM) were compared between groups.
   RESULTS: Compared with PLIF group, KDSS group had shorter duration of operation and less blood loss (P < 0.001). There were no differences in hospital stay, complications, and patient satisfaction. Both groups demonstrated significant improvement in visual analog scale back and leg pain and Oswestry Disability Index. No significant difference was found between groups at any time point (P > 0.05). Postoperative disk height index and foraminal height increased significantly compared with preoperatively (P < 0.05). Although disk height index and foraminal height in KDSS group were smaller than PLIF group values, there were no significant differences between groups. ROM of total lumbar and implanted segment was decreased compared with preoperative ROM in both groups (P < 0.05), but the 2 values were higher in KDSS group (P < OM),
   CONCLUSIONS: Both KDSS and PLIF can improve clinical and radiographic outcomes for early-stage lumbar degenerative disease. Compared with PLIF, KDSS has better operative time, less blood loss, and better preservation of ROM, but prospective, randomized, controlled trials with larger sample size and longer follow-up are required.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cervical spine alignment and range of motion (ROM) of neck flexion in patients with Hirayama disease.
   METHODS: Fifty male patients were included, with dynamic radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analyzed retrospectively. The Cobb angles for the entire cervical spine (C2-C7) and each level (C2/3-C6/7) were measured, and the neck flexion ROM was defined as the neutral Cobb angle minus the flexion Cobb angle. Paired t tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare the Cobb angles and ROM between radiographs and MK
   RESULTS: The neutral and flexion Cobb angles decreased from C2/3 to C5/6 but increased at C6/7 on radiographs and MRI. The neutral Cobb angle of C2-C7 from radiographs was significantly larger than that seen on MRI (5.27 degrees vs. 3,26 degrees; P < 0.0001). Neck flexion ROM seen with MRI tended to be lower than those of corresponding levels on radiographs. The ROM of C2-C7, C3/4, and C6/7 on radiographs was significantly larger than that seen with MRI (37.86 degrees vs. 26.59 degrees, P < 0.0001; 7.46 degrees vs. 5.10 degrees, P = 0.0071; and 10.45 degrees vs. 7.03 degrees, P = 0.0023, respectively). For the lower cervical levels, the largest and second largest ROM were seen in C5/6 and C6/7 on the radiographs but C5/6 and C4/5 on MRI
   CONCLUSIONS: The cervical spine alignment and neck flexion ROM in Hirayama disease differed between radiographs and MRI. Both imaging techniques should be examined comprehensively when planning an operation.

AB BACKGROUND: A standard post-concomitant radiochemotherapy involving adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) was stopped after 6 cycles for high-grade gliomas (HGG). Several studies demonstrated that prolonged TMZ treatment increased survival for these patients.
   METHODS: This retrospective study aimed to compare changes in tumor volume during and after adjuvant TMZ treatment and overall survival (OS).
   RESULTS: There were 90 patients were administered adjuvant TMZ treatment. Comparing average tumor volume changes during TMZ treatment and after TMZ was stopped, a significant decrease in tumor volume was observed during TMZ treatment in the total patient population, the anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) group, and the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) group (P <= 0.001, P = 0.042, and P = 0.005, respectively). Median overall survival was 78.4 weeks, which was significant regarding the surgical tumor resection rate (r = 0.241; P = 0.04) and total TMZ treatment cycles (r = 0.631; P <= 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: During adjuvant TMZ treatment, tumor volume decreased significantly (P = 0.042, and P = 0.005, respectively) in patients with GBM and AA. Prolonged TMZ administration improved OS, without increased toxicity.

AB BACKGROUND: Cervical spine injuries are a common cause of morbidity and mortality; however, the optimal treatment of many of these injuries is debated, and previous studies have shown substantial variation in treatment. We sought to examined treatment variation in arthrodesis and halo/tong placement in cervical spine injury patients over a 12-year period.
   METHODS: Data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization National Inpatient Sample, from 2000 to 2011, were used for this study. Patients were identified with a cervical vertebral facture or dislocation based on the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes, Using chi(2) analysis, spinal arthrodesis rates and halo/tong placement rates were compared between hospitals based on teaching status for patients with and without spinal cord injury (SCI).
   RESULTS: The records of 107152 patients with cervical fractures were examined. From 2000 to 2011, the overall arthrodesis rates fell from 25.2% to 20.6% (P < 0.001), and halo/tong placement rates fell from 13,2% to 3.6% (P < 0.001). In patients with cervical fracture without SCI, arthrodesis rates fell from 17.6% to 13.9% (P < 0.001), in cervical fracture patients with SCI, arthrodesis rates rose from 50.0% to 58.9% (P < 0.001), and in cervical dislocation patients, arthrodesis rates rose from 47,6% to 57.5% (P < 0.001). During the 12-year period, teaching hospitals had higher arthrodesis rates compared with nonteaching hospitals for patients with cervical fractures with SCI (57.3% vs. 53.4%, P 0.001) and higher halo/tong placement rates for patients with cervical dislocations (2.7% vs. 1.7%, P = 0.004). Individual hospital variation showed a 3.5-fold variation in arthrodesis rates in 2000 to 2002. which fell to 3,0-fold by 2009 to 2011.
   CONCLUSIONS: Arthrodesis rates for cervical fracture patients significantly decreased, and arthrodesis rates for cervical dislocation and SCI patients increased from 2000 to 2011, with variability in treatment based on hospital teaching status. Rates of halo/tong placement rapidly decreased for cervical spine trauma at both teaching and nonteaching hospitals. Individual hospital treatment variation also decreased over the study period, Further clinical studies examining the optimal treatment for spine trauma may lead to continued decreases in treatment variability.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe lower cranial nerve (CN) palsy following vertical overdistraction when performing occipitocervical fusion (OCF) to treat vertical atlantoaxial dislocation (AAD) and basilar invagination (BI) and investigate its possible causes.
   METHODS: We report 4 cases with vertical AAD and BI who presented postoperatively with neurogenic dysphagia, dysarthria, and bucking after undergoing anatomic reduction.
   RESULTS: Patients underwent revision surgery to achieve partial reduction and demonstrated remarkable recovery of CN IX, X, and XI deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: Performing OCF in the overdistraction position to treat vertical AAD may caudally displace the brainstem relative to the cranial base, resulting in traction injury to the CN IX, X, and XI where they exit the skull base through the jugular foramen.

AB OBJECTIVE: To perform a survival analysis of human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients with glioma and to assess the relationship between various prognostic factors and overall survival (OS).
   METHODS: We reported in detail the management and prognosis of 2 HIV-infected patients with glioma in our hospital and performed a quantitative and comprehensive systematic literature review of patients with HIV associated glioma. We combined our treatment experience with retrospectively obtained treatment information and studied the survival time to statistically analyze whether age, sex, World Health Organization (WHO) grade, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy could predict patient survival.
   RESULT: The study included 34 cases, including our own 2 cases, The median survival was 9 months. On survival analysis, among the aforementioned parameters, WHO grade (low-grade glioma/high-grade glioma), surgery (surgical resection/stereotactic biopsy), and radiotherapy showed a significant association with OS by univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed WHO grade and surgery were significant predictors of OS.
   CONCLUSIONS: Most patients had astrocytoma or high-grade glioma. The median survival of all HIV-infected patients with gliomas was shorter than that of GBM patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Surgery and WHO grade were independent prognostic factors for OS.

AB PURPOSE: We sought to report a minimum 12 months' follow-up results of our improved bone graft method for upper cervical surgery with the posterior approach.
   METHODS: Among 52 consecutive cases, odontoid nonunion occurred in 33 patients, atlantoaxial instability in 11 patients, and occipitocervical deformity in 8 patients who underwent posterior C1-C2 transarticular screw/screw-rod internal fixation (41 cases) and occi-pitocervical fusion (11 cases) with the improved bone graft technique. Each surgical procedure was performed by the same senior spine surgeon. We took lateral cervical standing roentgenograms before surgery and immediately after surgery. Then we conducted craniocerebral computed tomography examination with reconstruction at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months and annually thereafter. The postoperative follow-up times are about 12-38 months.
   RESULTS: All cases showed satisfactory screw fixation by radiographic examination, and there were no postoperative neurologic complications. One case had postoperative retropharyngeal infection after the transoral release and posterior reduction by pedicle screw instrumentation. All patients got solid fusions, and no pseudarthrosis occurred. All cases had solid fusions at the 3-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSION: Good bone graft bed, enough bone graft material, solid local fixation, and effective bone graft method are prerequisites for a successful bone graft. By analyzing postoperative follow-up in the consecutive cases in this study, our bone graft method describing a new bone graft structure is a reliable posterior fusion technique. It is worth considering, and further research is needed.

AB OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a serious trauma without efficient treatment currently. Necroptosis can be blocked post injury by special inhibitors. This study is to investigate the effects, mechanism, and potential benefit of necrosulfonamide (NSA) for SCI therapy.
   METHODS: Pathologic condition was detected using hematoxylin-eosin staining on injured spinal cord and other major organs. Necroptosis-related factors-RIP1, RIP3, and MLKL-were detected using Western blot. Detections on mitochondrial functions such as adenosine triphosphate generation and activities of superoxide dismutase and caspase-3 were also performed. Finally, ethologic performance was detected using a 21-point open-field locomotion test.
   RESULTS: Reduced lesions and protected neurons were found in the injured spinal cord after treatment with NSA using hematoxylin-eosin staining for pathologic detection. No obvious toxicity on rat liver, kidney, heart, and spleen was detected. Rather than RIP1 and RIP3, MLKL was significantly inhibited by the NSA using Western blot detection. Adenosine triphosphate generation was obviously decreased post injury but slightly increased after the NSA treatment, especially 24 hours post injury. No significant changes were found on activities of superoxide dismutase and caspase-3 after the treatment of NSA. Ethologic performance was significantly improved using a 21-point, open-field locomotion test.
   CONCLUSIONS: : Our research indicates NSA attenuates the spinal cord injury via necroptosis inhibition. It might be a potential and safe chemical benefit for SCI therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the effects of NSA as treatment of traumatic SCI.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate pituitary abscess (PA) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features to improve the neuroradiologic and diagnostic knowledge of this rare disease and guide follow-up treatments.
   METHODS: Clinical data were collected for 51 patients with PA, and MRI data were quantitatively reviewed in a retrospective analysis. Clinical factors were analyzed to investigate their relevance.
   RESULTS: PA neuroimaging showed special radiologic features, including hypointensity or isointensity on T1weighted imaging (30 patients, 58.8%), isointensity or hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging (39 patients, 76.5%), and disappearance of the posterior pituitary bright spot in most patients (44 patients, 86.3%). After gadolinium injection, rim or rimlike enhancement was observed in 82.4% of patients (n = 42). Half of those patients showed typical rim enhancement (profound peripheral enhancement with internal hypointensity); others showed atypical rim enhancement with special signs, such as enhanced, thick abscess wall and hyperintense flocculent or cottonlike foci within the internal hypointense region. Almost all patients (96.1%) presented at least 1 sign of adjacent anatomic structure invasion, including peripheral meninges enhancement, pituitary stalk thickening, and paranasal sinus mucosa enhancement. Rank correlation analysis of the clinical time course and MRI characteristics of PA showed a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.270, indicating borderline significance (P = 0.055).
   CONCLUSIONS: Classic MRI characteristics of PA show T1 signal hypointensity or isointensity, T2 signal isointensity or hyperintensity, and peripheral rim enhancement after gadolinium injection. The MRI appearance of PA may reflect the abscess liquefaction and formation. Despite its profound significance for differential diagnosis, adjacent structure invasion is generally ignored by clinicians.

AB OBJECTIVE: Bibliometric analysis is a commonly used analytic tool for objective determination of the most influential and peer-recognized articles within a given field. This study is the first bibliometric analysis of the literature in the field of invasive neuromodulation, excluding deep brain stimulation. The objectives of this study are to identify the 50 most cited articles in invasive neuromodulation, provide an overview of the literature to assist in clinical education, and evaluate the effect of impact factor on manuscript recognition.
   METHODS: Bibliometric analysis was performed using the Science Citation Index from the Institute for Scientific Information, accessed through the Web of Science. Search terms relevant to the field of invasive neuromodulation were used to identify the 50 most cited journal articles between 1900 and 2016.
   RESULTS: The median number of citations was 236 (range, 173e578). The most common topics among the articles were vagus nerve stimulation (n = 24), spinal cord stimulation (n = 9), and motor cortex stimulation (n = 6). Median journal impact factor was 5.57. Most of these articles (n = 19) contained level I, II, or III evidence.
   CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides a brief look into the most cited articles within the field, many of which evaluated innovated procedures and therapies that helped to drive surgical neuromodulation forward. These landmark articles contain vital clinical and educational information that remains relevant to clinicians and students within the field and provide insight into areas of expanding research. Journal impact factor may play a significant role in determining the literary relevance and general awareness of invasive neuromodulation studies.

   NERVE-STIMULATION; ABLATION; PROPOSAL
AB BACKGROUND: The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided ablation methods, such as laser interstitial thermal therapy and MRI-guided radiofrequency thermocoagulation (RF-TC), poses a risk of mistreatment in patients with nonepileptic hypothalamic hamartoma (HH). Using stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG)-guided RF-TC could solve this problem; however, there are no reports on the efficacy of this technique. Thus, we examined the safety and efficacy of this method.
   METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in 9 consecutive patients with HH treated between August 2015 and July 2017. All patients underwent a single round of SEEG-guided RF-TC treatment after comprehensive assessment. Outcomes were assessed using Engel's classification system. Spearman's correlation and receiver operating characteristic curves were analyzed to identify potential factors predictive of seizure outcome after an average follow-up duration of 18.78 months.
   RESULTS: A total of 20 SEEG electrodes were implanted in 9 patients with HH, and 73 lesions were created within the tumors. No obvious symptoms were observed during coagulation. Five patients (55.56%) achieved Engel's class I recovery, and the other 4 (44.44%) achieved Engel's class II recovery; weight gain was observed in 1 patient. Correlation analysis revealed a trend of better seizure outcomes
   CONCLUSIONS: The SEEG signal can guide ablation of HH. SEEG-guided RF-TC is a safe procedure that shows promising efficacy. Special attention to the tumor attachment and multiple rounds of RF-TC might help improve seizure-free rates in the future.

AB BACKGROUND: Anterior percutaneous endoscopic transcorporeal cervical discectomy is an alternative operation for cervical disc herniation. However, few reports have evaluated the biomechanical influence of tunnels on vertebrae. We compared biomechanical distinctions between intact and tunneled models of vertebrae to analyze the safety of anterior percutaneous endoscopic transcorporeal cervical discectomy based on a C2-T1 finite element (FE) model.
   METHODS: Groups of C2-T1 FE models were simulated with C4 tunneled by 2 methods (group A: with partial superior endplate excision; group B: without partial superior endplate excision) and various tunnel diameters (6, 8, and 10 mm). All FE models were loaded under a 1-Nm flexion moment.
   RESULTS: The area and maximum of stress concentrations were correlated with tunnel diameter, The distribution of stress on C4 superior endplates showed no significant difference between B6 and the intact model (P > 0.05), but significant differences with other tunneled models (P < 0.001). Maximum stress on the lateral wall of tunnels was positively correlated with tunnel diameter and induced high risks of cancellous bone fracture for diameters reaching 10 mm in group B and 8 mm in group A.
   CONCLUSIONS: Transcorporeal tunnel in C4 vertebrae without endplate excision should be limited with diameter of 6 mm, and a tunnel diameter >10 mm, excision of the endplate >8 mm, and excision of the center side of the endplate should also be avoided.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to analyze axis deformities and the biomechanics related to atlantoaxial dislocation (AAD) in patients with basilar invagination (BI).
   METHODS: Seventy-six patients were retrospectively analyzed including 21 patients who had BI (group B), 32 patients with BI and AAD (group C), and 23 nondeformity control subjects (group A). Using 3-dimensional computed tomography imaging the distance from the tip of the dens above the Chamberlain line in the sagittal plane, atlantodental interval, sagittal inclination, coronal inclination, and craniocervical tilt, the height of the odontoid and ratio of the height to the odontoid basal width were measured in each patient. We statistically analyzed the resulting data for correlations among physiologic measurements and disease state.
   RESULTS: The height of the odontoid process in groups A, B, and C was 13.38 +/- 1.50 mm, 10.87 +/- 1.48 mm, and 8.49 +/- 2.49 mm, respectively. The ratio of height-to-basal width of the odontoid in groups A, B, and C was 1.32 +/- 0.21, 0.91 +/- 0.21, and 0.65 +/- 0.17, respectively. The sagittal inclination in groups A, B, and C was 85.85 +/- 4.55 degrees, 105.76 +/- 10.72 degrees, and 123.48 +/- 12.43 degrees, and the coronal inclination was 108.95 +/- 24.09 degrees, 105.40 +/- 25.16 degrees, and 108.82 +/- 21.41 degrees, respectively. The craniocervical tilt in groups A, B, and C was 60.31 +/- 6.98 degrees, 84.53 +/- 18.94 degrees, and 71.79 +/- 11.69 degrees, respectively. The height of the odontoid, height-to-basal width, and sagittal inclination were significantly correlated with both BI and AAD (P < 0.001). Odontoid height and height-to-basal width ratio were significantly correlated with BI, AAD, and sagittal inclination (P < 0.001). Finally, craniocervical tilt was correlated only with the BI severity (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSION: This study confirms that deformities of the odontoid process and the lateral joint correlate with severity of BI, while deformity of the odontoid process may be a primary factor in AAD for patients with BI.

AB OBJECTIVE: Whether surgery should be performed in patients with acute onset of moyamoya disease (MMD) is controversial. This study aimed to determine optimum operative time for patients with MMD.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 57 patients with MMD admitted between January 2016 and AMC 2017. All patients consented to combined revascularization. Considering the time interval between acute onset of MMD and surgery, we divided all patients into an early group and later group (>90 days between MMD onset and surgery). We compared postoperative complications, neurologic improvement, and favorable outcome between groups to estimate optimum operative time of revascularization.
   RESULTS: More patients in the early group presented with ischemic events compared with the later group (18/28 vs. 11/29, P = 0.047). The difference in worst preoperative mRS score (>= 3) between groups was not statistically significant (3/28 vs, 3/29, P = 0.96/). Rate of postoperative complications in the early group was significantly higher than in the later group (39.2% vs. 13.7%, P = 0.029). There was neurologic improvement in 50.0% of patients in the early group and 75.9% of patients in the later group (P = 0,043), The rate of favorable outcome after revascularization in the later group (89.7%) was higher than in the early group (78.6%), but there was no significant difference (P = 0.251).
   CONCLUSIONS: It seems more reasonable to opt for delayed revascularization for patients with acute-onset MMD but the decision must take into account the morbidity of ongoing ischemic or hemorrhagic events.

AB OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of stereotactic radiotherapy combined with bevacizumab (SRT-Bv) compared with Bv treatment for recurrent high-grade gliomas (HGGs).
   METHODS: Data for patients with recurrent HGGs who received SRT and Bv (n = 29) or Bv (n = 29) between June 2014 and September 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received conventional radiotherapy (total, 60 Gy) before this study. SRT was administered at a median dose of 42 Gy in 3-7 fractions. The recurrence pattern was classified into 3 groups: in-field, marginal, and out-field.
   RESULTS: The median overall survival in the SRT-Bv group was significantly longer than that in the Bv group (10.4 vs. 5.6 months; P = 0.02). In patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type tumors, the SRT-Bv treatment significantly prolonged survival more than the Bv treatment (10.9 vs. 8.2 months; P = 0.01). The World Health Organization grade and presence or absence of SRT were significant prognostic factors in the univariate analysis. Besides brain edema in 2 cases and asymptomatic subdural hematoma in 1 case, no other severe adverse effect due to SRT-Bv treatment was recorded. The pattern of recurrence was as follows: in-field, 2 cases (7%); marginal, 8 cases (28%); out-field, 11 cases (38%); no recurrence on radiologic findings, 6 cases (21%); and uncertain, 2 cases (7%).
   CONCLUSIONS: SRT-Bv treatment significantly prolonged survival duration more than Bv treatment and provides good local control in patients with recurrent HGGs, especially those with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type tumors.

TI Efficacy of Caudal Epidural Steroid Injection with Targeted Indwelling
   Catheter and Manipulation in Managing Patients with Lumbar Disk
   Herniation and Radiculopathy: A Prospective, Randomized, Single-Blind
   Controlled Trial
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English

   Association; Oswestry Disability Index
ID LOW-BACK-PAIN; SCIATICA; THERAPY
AB BACKGROUND: Lumbar disk herniation (LDH) is considered a common cause of lumbosacral radiculopathy. Epidural steroid injection is a common method to treat inflammation associated with low backerelated leg pain. Spinal manipulations are widely used, and systematic reviews have also shown that these manipulations are more effective than placebos.
   OBJECTIVE: Due to the absence of clinical evidence, we designed a prospective, randomized, single-blind controlled trial in patients with LDH with radiculopathy, aiming to detect the safety and clinical efficacy of targeted indwelling catheter combined with "4-step" manipulative therapy in patients with LDH.
   METHODS: Patient visits were performed at baseline and days 1, 3, 7, and 28 after treatment. Clinical outcomes were measured using visual analog scale for back and leg pain, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and clinical symptom scores of the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JAO).
   RESULTS: The study included 85 eligible patients. They were categorized with a randomization schedule into a Catheter Group (N = 43) and No-Catheter Group (N = 42). Between the measurement points, there was a statistically significant difference in the visual analog scale (back) at days 1, 3, and 7 of follow-up after treatment between the 2 groups. The change was statistically different at days 1 and 3, and a higher change was observed in the Catheter Group compared with the No-Catheter Group. There was a statistically significant difference in change of JOA and ODI scores at day 1 of follow-up after treatment between the 2 groups, and a greater change was seen in the Catheter Group at days 1 and 3 compared with the No-Catheter Group.
   LIMITATIONS: The small sample size was small, and the follow-up time was short. The study also lacked documents of adjuvant therapies, like individual patient exercise routines and analgesic drug therapy.
   CONCLUSION: Both methods were effective in reducing pain intensity and functional disability compared with pretreatment. The Catheter Group showed a more significant decrease in visual analog scale and greater changes in JOA and ODI scores of short/term follow-up, compared with the No-Catheter Group. The therapy project was safe.

AB BACKGROUND: Distinguishing radiation necrosis from brain tumor recurrence remains challenging. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy of 2 different amino acid tracers used in positron emission tomography/ computed tomography scans: F-18-FDOPA (6-[F-18]-fluoro-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) and F-18-FET (O-(2-F-18-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine).
   METHODS: We searched for studies in 3 databases: PubMed, Embase, and Chinese Biomedical databases. The data were extracted from eligible studies and then processed with heterogeneity test, threshold effect test, and calculations of sensitivity, specificity, and area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were performed to explore the source of heterogeneity.
   RESULTS: A total of 48 studies (F-18-FDOPA, n = 21; F-18-FET, n = 27) were included. Quantitative synthesis determined pooled weight values in the F-18-FDOPA and F-18-FET groups: sensitivity, 0.85 versus 0.82; specificity, 0.77 versus 0.80; diagnostic odds ratio, 21.7 versus 23.03; area under the curve (AUC) values, 0.8771 versus 0.8976 (P = 0.46). Moreover, the type of tumor was identified as the possible source of the significant heterogeneity (I-2 = 52%; P = 0.003) found in the F-18-FDOPA group. In meta-regression and subgroup analyses, F-18-FDOPA showed better diagnostic accuracy in patients with glioma compared with patients with brain metastases (AUC values, 0.9691 vs. 0.837; P < 0.01). F-18-FDOPA also showed a significant advantage in the diagnosis of glioma recurrence compared with F-18-FET (AUC values, 0.9691 vs. 0.9124; P = 0.015).
   CONCLUSIONS: Both F-18-FDOPA and F-18-FET exhibit moderate overall accuracy in diagnosing brain tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis. However, F-18-FDOPA is more adept at diagnosing glioma recurrence compared with brain metastases, and it is more effective than F-18-FET in diagnosing glioma recurrence.

AB BACKGROUND: Innovation is a part of the daily practice of neurosurgery. However, a clear definition of what constitutes innovation is lacking and opinions vary from continent to continent, from hospital to hospital, and from surgeon to surgeon.
   METHODS: In this study, we distributed an online survey to neurosurgeons from multiple countries to investigate what neurosurgeons consider innovative, by gathering opinions on several hypothetical cases. The anonymous survey consisted of 52 questions and took approximately 10 minutes to complete.
   RESULTS: A total of 355 neurosurgeons across all continents excluding Antarctica completed the survey. Neurosurgeons achieved consensus (>75%) in considering specific cases to be innovative, including laser resection of meningioma, focused ultrasonography for tumor, oncolytic virus, deep brain stimulation for addiction, and photodynamic therapy for tumor. Although the new dura substitute case was not considered innovative, there was consensus among neurosurgeons indicating that institutional review board approval was still necessary to maintain ethical standards. Furthermore, although 90% of neurosurgeons considered an oncolytic virus for glioblastoma multiforme to be innovative, only 78% believed that institutional review board approval was necessary before treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that innovation is a heterogeneous concept among neurosurgeons that necessitates standardization to ensure appropriate patient safety without stifling progress. We discuss both the ethical drawbacks of not having a clear definition of innovation and the challenges in achieving a unified understanding of innovation in neurosurgery and offer suggestions for uniting the field.

AB BACKGROUND: Hematoma expansion (HE) is independently associated with clinical outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Hematoma heterogeneity on noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) is reportedly predictive of HE, but conclusions are inconsistent. We sought to clarify the relationship between hematoma heterogeneity and HE by pooling the pertinent publications.
   METHODS: The Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase were searched for related studies examining the correlation of HE with hematoma heterogeneity, and the secondary endpoint was defined as poor outcome. The effect size was odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI). Results from each study were pooled using a random-effects model.
   RESULTS: Ten studies were included with a total of 5931 patients and 675 HEs. We detected a statistically significant association between NCCT heterogeneity and HE (OR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.82-3.56; P < 0.001), while the correlation with poor outcome was nonsignificant (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.94-1.54, P = 0.15).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that hematoma heterogeneity on NCCT is positively associated with an increased risk of HE. The relationship between hematoma heterogeneity and poor outcome merits evaluation in further prospective studies.

AB OBJECTIVE: The kinematic characteristics of Modic changes (MCs) in the lumbar spine have rarely been reported; furthermore, the effect of disc degeneration (DD) on segmental motion has not been considered in analyzing the motion characteristics of MCs. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the kinematic characteristics of MCs based on different DD grades.
   METHODS: 894 patients with 4470 lumbar segments were reviewed, and those with MCs were selected for segmental motion evaluation. MC type was defined as 0, I, II, and III, and DD grade was classified into 5 groups from grade A to grade E. Segmental angular and translational motion were calculated from X-ray images in positions of flexion and extension, and the absolute values of the differences were recorded.
   RESULTS: MCs were observed in 308 segments from 260 patients. No MC was found in DD grade A, and MC III was not observed in DD grade B. MC I was found to significantly increase angular motion in the DD grade E group, and MC II could enlarge translational motion in the DD grade D group (all P < 0.05); MC III had the lowest segmental motion in both angular and translational motion; There was no statistical difference in angular and translational motion between MC I and II in all DD grade groups (all P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: MC III indicates the final stable phase of segmental motion. MC I might increase angular motion, and MC II would increase certain translational motions in the segments that were believed to be stable.

ID CLINICAL-FEATURES; SURGICAL OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND: Subependymoma is rare, and little is known about subependymoma with intratumoral hemorrhage.
   METHODS: A retrospective study of subependymoma was performed. Among 61 subependymomas, 4 cases of intratumoral hemorrhage were collected. All 4 cases were pathologically confirmed to be subependymoma and showed a benign character.
   RESULTS: After complete subependymoma resection, the 4 patients achieved favorable outcomes. Pathology showed that dilated thin-walled vessels and/or hyalinosis of the vessel walls existed in all 4 cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: The present series showed that subependymomas with hemorrhage and benign pathology are rare and that surgical treatment results in good prognosis. This series supports the hypothesis that the pathology of vascular degeneration may contribute to subependymoma hemorrhage.

AB BACKGROUND: Lateral lumbar interbody fusion using cage supplemented with fixation has been used widely in the treatment of lumbar disease. A combined fixation (CF) of lateral plate and spinous process plate may provide multiplanar stability similar to that of bilateral pedicle screws (BPS) and may reduce morbidity. The biomechanical influence of the CF on cage subsidence and facet joint stress has not been well described. The aim of this study was to compare biomechanics of various fixation options and to verify biomechanical effects of the CF.
   METHODS: The surgical finite element models with various fixation options were constructed based on computed tomography images. The lateral plate and posterior spinous process plate were applied (CF). The 6 motion modes were simulated. Range of motion (ROM), cage stress, endplate stress, and facet joint stress were compared.
   RESULTS: For the CF model, ROM, cage stress, and endplate stress were the minimum in almost all motion modes. Compared with BPS, the CF reduced ROM, cage stress, and endplate stress in all motion modes. The ROM was reduced by more than 10% in all motion modes except for flexion; cage stress and endplate stress were reduced more than 10% in all motion modes except for rotation-left. After interbody fusion, facet joint stress was reduced substantially compared with the intact conditions in all motion modes except for flexion.
   CONCLUSIONS: The combined plate fixation may offer an alternative to BPS fixation in lateral lumbar interbody fusion.

AB OBJECTIVE: We used a finite element (FE) analysis to investigate the biomechanical changes caused by transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) at the L4-L5 level by lumbar lordosis (LL) degree.
   METHODS: A lumbar FE model (L1-S5) was constructed based on computed tomography scans of a 30-year-old healthy male volunteer (pelvic incidence, = 50 degrees; LL, 52 degrees). We investigated the influence of LL on the biomechanical behavior of the lumbar spine after TLIF in L4-L5 fusion models with 5 degrees, 52 degrees, 47 degrees, and 40 degrees LL. The LL was defined as the angle between the superior end plate of L1 and the superior end plate of S1. A 150-N vertical axial preload was imposed on the superior surface of L3. A 10-N/m moment was simultaneously applied on the L3 superior surface along the radial direction to simulate the 4 basic physio-logic motions of flexion, extension, lateral bending, and torsion in the numeric simulations. The range of motion (ROM) and intradiscal pressure (IDP) of L3-L4 were evaluated and compared in the simulated cases.
   RESULTS: In all motion patterns, the ROM and IDP were both increased after TLIF. In addition, the decrease in lordosis generally increased the ROM and IDP in all motion patterns.
   CONCLUSIONS: This FE analysis indicated that decreased spinal lordosis may evoke overstress of the adjacent segment and increase the risk of the pathologic development of adjacent segment degeneration; thus, adjacent segment degeneration should be considered when planning a spinal fusion procedure.

AB OBJECTIVE: More nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (NaSAH) are found in clinical practice. However, the precise mechanisms in which D-dimer level is associated with clinical condition in patients with NaSAH remain unclear. But even more, the data assessing the risk of clinical course in the patients with NaSAH are scarce. Our objective was to investigate whether D-dimer levels correlated with complication and outcome in patients with NaSAH.
   METHODS: Between February 2013 and May 2017, 92 patients suffering from NaSAH were treated in our hospital. Patient characteristics, radiologic features, laboratory findings, complications, and outcomes were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were stratified into the peri-mesencephalic (PM) subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) group and the nonperimesencephalic (NPM) SAH group according to the bleeding type, and the NPM-SAH group was further divided into 2 subgroups into the NPM-elevated group and the NPM-normal group based on the value of the D-dimer. After statistical analysis, the NPM-SAH and PM-SAH groups were compared; the same was true for the NPM-elevated group and the NPM-normal group.
   RESULTS: The rate of complications in the NPM-SAH group was higher than in the PM-SAH group, including early hydrocephalus, delayed cerebral ischemia, clinical vasospasm, pneumonia, and hyponatremia. Our results showed that D-dimer levels in patients with NPM-SAH were more elevated than in those with PM-SAH. Further analysis of subgroups demonstrated that patients with elevated D-dimer levels had a higher incidence of complications than those with normal D-dimer levels, especially the risks of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus and pneumonia. In addition, disability, and even death, could be seen in patients with higher levels of D-dimer, but the long-term outcomes were not particularly obvious between these groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Elevated D-dimer levels on admission were significantly associated with complication in patients with NPM-SAH. In addition to conventional radiologic diagnosis, D-dimer levels can increase the ability of a rapid differential diagnosis between NPM-SAH and PM-SAH.

AB BACKGROUND: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating subtype of stroke. Patients with ICH have poor functional outcomes. The association between blood glucose level and functional outcome in ICH remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association between blood glucose level and functional outcomes in patients with ICH.
   METHODS: Literature was searched systemically in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Published cohort studies evaluating the association between blood glucose and functional outcome in patients with ICH were included. This meta-analysis was performed using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   RESULTS: A total of 16 studies were included in our meta-analysis. Our data show that hyperglycemia defined by cutoff values was significantly associated with unfavorable functional outcome (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.36-2.39; P < 0.001). Our analysis also suggested a significant association between increased blood glucose levels and functional outcomes (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.07; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: High blood glucose level is significantly associated with poor functional outcome in ICH. Further studies with larger sample sizes, more time points, and longer follow-up times are necessary to confirm this association.

AB BACKGROUND: Research has shown that ischemic preconditioning reduced the severity of ischemia-reperfusion injury in brain in rats, we have a hypothesis that repeated brief ischemia has positive effects on peripheral nerve damage. This study was conducted to investigate the potential protective effects of repeated brief ischemia on peripheral nerve regeneration using a rat model of experimental sciatic nerve transection injury.
   METHODS: Treatment groups (groups A-D) received repeated, brief ischemia every 1 day/2 days/3 days/7 days. After surgery for 4, 8, 12 weeks, we evaluated sciatic functional index test, gastrocnemius muscle wet mass, axon and nerve fiber diameter, density, G-ratio, immuno-histochemistry of S-100, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the ultrastructure of the nerves.
   RESULTS: Sciatic functional index test and muscle wet mass were improved on the repeated brief ischemia groups. Ischemia treatment resulted in a significant increase in axon and nerve fiber density as well as S-100 and VEGF-positive cell, which indicated that repeated brief ischemia promotes Schwann cell proliferation and reconstruction.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study exhibits the positive effects of repeated brief ischemia in sciatic nerve transection injury, possibly in part because it can improve VEGF and the physiologic state of Schwann cells in the ischemic environment and then accelerate the ability of neurite outgrow.

AB High-quality all-inorganic perovskite CsPb(BrxI1-x)(3) quantum dots (QDs) with quantum yield of 50% were systematically studied as yellow light convertor for light emitting diodes (LEDs). A novel heat insulation structure was designed for the QD-converted yellow LEDs. In this structure, a silicone layer was set on top of the GaN LED chip to prevent directly heating of the QDs by the LED chip. Then the CsPb(BrxI1-x)(3) QDs were filled in the bowl shaped silicone layer after ultrasonic dispersion treatment. Finally, an Al2O3 passivation layer was grown on the QDs layer by Atomic Layer Disposition at 40 degrees C. When x = 0.55, highly pure yellow LEDs with an emission peak at similar to 570 nm and a full width at half maximum of 25 nm were achieved. The chromaticity coordinates of the QD-converted yellow LEDs (0.4920 +/- 0.0017, 0.4988 +/- 0.0053) showed almost no variation under driving current from 5 mA to 150 mA. During an operation period of 60 min, the emission wavelength of the yellow LEDs showed no distinct shift. Moreover, the luminous efficiency of the QD-converted yellow LEDs achieved 13.511 m/W at 6 mA. These results demonstrated that CsPb(BrxI1-x)(3) QDs and the heat insulation structure are promising candidate for high purity yellow LEDs.

The effect of MgO on the microstructure evolution and optical properties of delivered ceramics were investigated. The results showed that the TAG ceramics doped with 0.4 wt.% TEOS and 0.1 wt.% MgO exhibited the optimum optical transmittance, which can reach about 81% in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions. The addition of MgO inhibited the grain growth and accelerated the densification of TAG ceramic at the sintering temperature reached about 1600 degrees C.

AB Measurements of X-ray photoelectron core-level and valence-band spectra for pristine and irradiated with Ar+ ions surfaces of LiGa0.5In0.5Se2 single crystal, novel nonlinear optical mid-IR selenide grown by a modified vertical Bridgman-Stockbarger technique, are reported. Electronic structure of LiGa0.5In05Se2 is elucidated from theoretical and experimental points of view. Notably, total and partial densities of states (DOSs) of the LiGa0.5In0.5Se2 compound are calculated based on density functional theory (DFT) using the augmented plane wave + local orbitals (APW + lo) method. In accordance with the DFT calculations, the principal contributors to the valence band are the Se 4p states, making the main input at the top and in the upper part of the band, while its bottom is dominated by contributions of the valence s states associated with Ga and In atoms. The theoretical total DOS curve peculiarities are found to be in excellent agreement with the shape of the X-ray photoelectron valence-band spectrum of the LiGa0.5In0.5Se2 single crystal. The bottom of the conduction band of LiGa0.5In0.5Se2 is formed mainly by contributions of the unoccupied Ga 4s and In 5s states in almost equal proportion, with somewhat smaller contributions of the unoccupied Se 4p states as well. Our calculations indicate that the LiGa0.5In0.5Se2 compound is a direct gap semiconductor. The principal optical constants of LiGa0.5In0.5Se2 are calculated in the present work.

AB We report the use of the Second Harmonic Generation response from a riboflavin doped chitosan film as a characterization method of the film morphology. This film is of particular interest in the development of new and bio-sourced material for eco-friendly UV lithography. The method allows us to determine how riboflavin is distributed as a function of film depth in the sample. This possibility is of importance in order to have a better understanding of the riboflavin influence in chitosan films during the lithography process. On the contrary, linear optical techniques provide no information beyond the mere confirmation of the riboflavin presence.

AB Tb3+/Eu3+ co-doped lanthanum molybdate nanophosphors were synthesized by conventional co-precipitation method. The Powder X-ray diffractogram revealed the formation of highly crystalline tetragonal nanocrystals with space group I4(1)/a and the detailed analysis of the small variation of lattice parameters with Tb/Eu co doping on the host lattice were carried out based on the ionic radii of the dopants. The FTIR spectra is employed to identify the fundamental vibrational modes in La2-x-y (MoO4)(3):xTb, yEu nanocrystals. The formation of nanocrystals by oriented attachment was recognized from the HR TEM images and the d-spacing calculated was in accordance with that corresponding to highest intensity diffraction peak in the XRD patterns. The constituent elements present in the samples were identified with the aid of EDAX and elemental mapping analysis. The broad Mo6+- O2- CTB and the sharp excitation peaks of Tb and Eu identified from the UV-Vis absorption spectra facilitates the suitability of exciting the phosphors effectively over NUV and visible region of the spectra. The possibility of energy transfer from host to Tb3+/Eu3+ ions and from Tb3+ to Eu3+ ions were confirmed from the PL excitation spectra monitoring D-5(0) -> F-7(2) transition of Eu3+ ions around 615 nm. The correlated analysis of PL emission spectra, life time measurements and CIE diagram, upon different excitation channels elucidate the excellent luminescent properties of La2-x-y (MoO4)(3):xTb, yEu nanophosphors with tunable emission colours in a wide range varying from yellow green region to reddish orange region and the efficient energy transfer from Tb3+ to Eu3+ ions in lanthanum molybdate host lattice. The Tb -> Eu energy transfer efficiency and probability were calculated from the decay measurements and the values were found to be satisfactory for exploiting the prepared nanophosphors for the development of multifunctional luminescent nanophosphors.

AB Large single crystals of Rb2KTiOF5 (RKTF), grown by slow solidification method, were studied (7-400 K) for various types of optical and radiation effects. The optical absorption spectra, the parameters of the Urbach rule at 293 K (sigma = 0.24 and E-U = 105 meV), the low-temperature reflection spectra (T = 7 K, E = 3.7-22 eV) were determined. The luminescence spectra (1.2-6.2 eV) and luminescence decay kinetics are studied upon excitation by a nanosecond electron beam (PCL), ultraviolet and vacuum ultraviolet light (PL), or X-rays radiation (XRL). PL excitation spectra under selective photoexcitation by synchrotron radiation (E = 3.7-22 eV, T = 7 K), temperature dependences of the intensity of steady-state XRL in different emission bands, as well as thermoluminescence (7-400 K) are studied. In the visible spectral region, we detected three luminescence bands that were attributed to radiative annihilation of intrinsic excitons (2.25 eV), recombination-type luminescence (2.1 eV) and luminescence of higher TiOF5 complexes (1.9 eV). The exponential component with lifetime of about 19 mu s was revealed in the PCL decay kinetics at 2.25 eV. The low-energy onset of the intrinsic host absorption E-c = 3.55 eV was determined on the basis of the experimental data obtained. Spectra of optical constants were calculated by the Kramers-Kronig method, the energy of the onset of the interband transitions E-g = 4.2 eV was determined, and the main peaks of the optical spectra were identified.

ID SPECTRAL PROPERTIES
AB Yb:CaYAlO4 single crystals were grown by the floating zone method and their spectral properties were investigated. Void formation was effectively suppressed by using a feed rod of Y-rich composition with the aid of a double zone-pass technique. For the oxygen excess composition of Th:Ca0.9925Y1.0075AlO4.00375, a void-free crystal was obtained by performing only the double zone-pass. On the other hand, for cation-deficient type of Yb:Ca0.9925Y1.005AlO4, void-free crystal could not be obtained by performing the double zone-pass. The void formation is attributable to the constitutional supercooling caused by segregation of main constituents of Y and Ca, and the congruent composition may exist in the Y-rich region with existence of interstitial excess oxide ions. The absorption cross section for alpha-polarization was slightly larger than that for pi-polarization, which is reasonable on the basis of the crystal structure of CaYAlO4.

AB Europium-doped silicate Ca3MgSi2O8 has been successfully obtained using solid-state reaction at 1400 degrees C in a vacuum atmosphere. The photoluminescence study of Eu2+ in investigated host showed broad emission band with a maximum at 480 nm attributed to the allowed 5d -> 4f electron transition of Eu2+ located in two different crystallographic sites. The excitation, emission spectra as well as the luminescence decays were analyzed. Thermal quenching process begins at 240 K, however, the emission stability of investigated compound is quite good, and emission intensity reached to 70% of its initial value at 100 degrees C. The QE of Ca3MgSi2O8: 0.5% Eu2+ excited at 365 run equal to 47%.

AB Zinc oxide nanoparticles were synthesized with microwave hydrothermal technique and tested as luminescent contrast for biological imaging. Luminescence was activated by Eu3+ ions embedded in the nanoparticle matrix in the increasing concentrations of 1, 5 and 10 %mol. It was found that europium did not create a separate crystalline phase up to the concentration as high as 5 %mol. However, Eu3+ ions did not substitute Zn2+ in the host lattice, but allocated in the low symmetry environment. It was proposed that europium was locating in the inter-grain space or on the surface of nanoparticles. The luminescence intensity in ZnO:Eu, as well as the size of particles, increased with the Eu ion concentration. Moreover, in 10 %mol Eu sample, the separate phase of Eu-hydroxide was identified with crystals of micrometre length. Interestingly, in vivo study revealed, that contrary to the in silica experiments, following gastric gavage, the brightest nanoparticle-related luminescence signal was observed at 1 %mol. concentration of Eu. Since the alimentary uptake of nanoparticles was related to their size, we concluded that the increase in luminescence at 5 and 10 %mol. Eu concentrations was associated with the largest ZnO:Eu and Eu-hydroxide particles that did not cross the gastrointestinal barrier.

Compared with the 1,3-dimethylpyrazoloquinoxaline (parent molecule), phenyl at the third position of pyrazole ring enhanced the fluorescence by increasing contribution of it pi-pi* transitions, whereas 1-phenyl substituent led to the formation of polarity-dependent charge transfer state. The molecules were also tested as potential luminophores in double layer OLED devices fabricated by solution processing techniques. The investigated pyrazoloquinoxaline based OLED's emitted green light with appreciable brightness up to 2820 cd/m(2).

AB The luminescence properties of Ce3+ activated (Gd,Lu)(3)Al5O12 single crystals are investigated as a function of the Gd/Lu ratio with the aim of an improved understanding of the luminescence quenching, energy transfer processes, and garnet phase stability. Upon heavy substitution of Lu with Gd, the target garnet phase becomes thermodynamically unstable and unwanted secondary phase inclusions arise. The secondary phase shows luminescence properties in the UV spectral range. The thermal quenching process of the 5d -> 4f emission of Ce3+ in the garnet phase is determined by the temperature dependence of the photoluminescence decay time and delayed radiative recombination decays. The results show that the onset of the thermal quenching is moved to lower temperatures with increasing the Gd3+ content. The main mechanism responsible for the luminescence quenching is due to the non-radiative relaxation from 5d(1) excited state to 4f ground state of Ce3+. The energy transfer processes between Gd3+ and Ce3+ as well as between secondary and garnet phase are evidenced by the photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra as well as decay kinetic measurements.

AB All Er3+ doped dielectric 1-D Photonic Band Gap Structure was fabricated by rf-sputtering technique. The structure was constituted by of twenty pairs of SiO2/TiO2 alternated layers doped with Er3+ ions. The scanning electron microscopy was used to check the morphology of the structure. Transmission measurements put in evidence the stop band in the range 1500 nm-1950 nm. The photoluminescence measurements were obtained by optically exciting the sample and detecting the emitted light in the 1.5 mu m region at different detection angles. Luminescence spectra and luminescence decay curves put in evidence that the presence of the stop band modify the emission features of the Er3+ ions.

AB In this contribution, we demonstrate that an aqueous solution with adjustable fluorescent color, including white light emission, can be achieved by a rapid one-step microwave synthesis method resulting in a mixture of blue emitting carbon dots (CDs) and the yellow-emitting 2,3-diaminophenazine (DAP). Aqueous mixtures of o-phenylene-diamine (oPD) and citric acid (CA) are used as precursors. The resulting product structures are analyzed by FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy and the size of the resulting CDs is determined by atomic force microscopy to be 1.1 +/- 0.3 nm. The synthesized solution exhibits two fluorescence emission peaks at 430 and 560 nm, which were found to originate from the CDs and DAP, respectively. The intensity ratio of both fluorescence peaks depends on pH, which is driven by the protonation state of DAP. In consequence, the fluorescence emission color of the CD solution can be tuned precisely and reproducibly from blue to white to yellow by careful control of the pH. Finally, at a pH level of 5.4, at which there is equal blue and yellow emission intensity, a white light emitting solution can be successfully produced in a very fast and simple synthesis procedure.

AB We report the opto-electrical response of organic field-effect transistors based on a thin-film of a semiconducting diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) core, a popular building block for molecular semiconductors, and a polymeric gate dielectric. The thin-film of the DPP core was thermally annealed at different temperatures under N-2 atmosphere to investigate the relationship between the annealing temperature and the electrical properties of the device. The results showed that the annealing process induces morphological changes in the thin film, and properly controlling the thermal annealing conditions can enhance the device performance. In addition, we also investigated in detail the photo-response behaviors by analyzing the responsivity (R) of the device with the optimally annealed DPP-core thin film under two light illumination conditions by considering the irradiance absorbed by the thin film instead of the total irradiance of the light source. We found that the proposed model could lead to a light-source-independent description of the photo-response behavior of the device, and which can be used for other applications.

AB Using the nanopowders synthesized by a reverse co-precipitation method, neodymium doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) transparent ceramics were fabricated by vacuum sintering method. The influence of ammonium carbonate to metal ions (NH4HCO3/M3+) molar ratio (R value) on the properties of Nd:YAG precursors and powders, as well as the densification, microstructure, and transmittance of the resultant ceramics was systematically investigated. The results show that the precursors have similar compositions and the calcined powders have pure Y3Al5O12 (YAG) phase. However, the R value is closely related to the morphologies of the precursors and powders. It is found that the powder with R = 3.0 has strongest agglomeration and the powders with R = 3.2-4.0 show better dispersity. Using these powders as starting materials, the corresponding ceramics were sintered at 1720 degrees C for 20 h in vacuum. As a result, the ceramic with R = 3.2 obtains the best transmittance of about 72% at the wavelength of 1064 nm. The grain growth exponent and activation energy of the Nd:YAG ceramics fabricated from the powder with R = 3.2 were also studied.

In Organic solar cell (OSC) devices ITO coated glass substrate used as a transparent anode electrode for light incident, HTL material Co3O4 dissolve in DMF solvent deposited on anode electrode, after that active layer material (donor/acceptor) deposited on to HTL and finally Al were deposited by thermal evaporation used as cathode electrode. These devices were fabricated with PCDTBT well known low band gap donor material in OSCs and blended with PC71BM as an acceptor material using simplest device structure ITO/Co3O4/active layer/Al at ambient conditions. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) based on Co3O4 and PEDOT:PSS have been achieved to up to 3.21% and 1.47% with PCDTBT respectively. In this study we reported that the devices fabricated with Co3O4 showed better performance as compare to the devices fabricated with well known and most studied solution processed HTL material PEDOT:PSS under identical environmental conditions. The surface morphology of the HTL film was characterized by (AFM). Lastly, we have provided Co3O4 as an efficient hole transport material HTL for solution processed organic photovoltaic applications.

AB Well-aligned zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire arrays were grown on an interdigital patterned fluorine tin oxide (FTO)coated glass substrate by a facile chemical bath deposition at low temperature. Morphology, crystalline structure, and optical properties of the ZnO nanowire arrays were analyzed in detail. The results revealed that the ZnO nanowires had wurtzite structure, typically similar to 40-60 nm in diameter, and similar to 700-800 nm in length, a great number of highly uniform and dense nanowires grew vertically on the substrate to form the well-aligned ZnO nanowire arrays, which had very high optical transmission (> 86%) in the visible light region. In addition, the performance of ZnO nanowire arrays ultraviolet (UV) photodetector was systematically examined. The photosensitivity (S), responsivity (R), response and decay time of the photodetector were 703 at + 0.2 V, 113 A/W at +5 V, 23 s and 73 s respectively. Also, the photoresponse mechanism of the UV photodetector was illuminated in terms of the oxygen adsorption-photodesorption process.

AB Different concentrations of Tb3+-doped oxyfluoro tellurite (TWGTb) glasses were prepared by conventional melt quenching technique and characterized for green laser applications. The Judd-Ofelt theory was applied to evaluate various spectroscopic and radiative parameters. The TWGTb glasses exhibit D-5(3) -> F-7(5.3) and D-5(4) -> F-7(6-0) transitions when excited at 316 nm radiation. The variation of intensity of D-5(4) -> F-7(5) (Green) and D-5(3) -> F-7(4) (Blue) transitions and the green to blue (I-G/I-B) intensity ratios were studied as a function of Tb3+ ions concentration. The laser characteristic parameters such as effective bandwidth (Delta lambda(eff)), stimulated emission crosssection (sigma(e)), gain bandwidth (sigma(e) x Delta lambda(eff)) and optical gain (sigma(e) x tau(R)) were determined using the three phenomenological Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters. The fluorescence decay profiles of D-5(4) metastable level exhibit single-exponential nature for all the samples. Based on the experimental results we suggest that the 1.0 mol% of Tb3+-doped TWGTb glass could be a suitable laser host material to emit intense green luminescence at 545 nm.

AB Gamma glycine, an organic material was grown by slow solvent evaporation method. Conventional polythermal method was employed in the temperature range, 30-50 degrees C to obtain the solubility and the metastable zonewidth. The crystal and molecular structures were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction, FT-IR and FT-Raman spectral studies. Optical refractive index was determined by prism coupling technique and was found to be 1.4488. Electrical properties such as ac conductivity and activation energy were studied for different temperatures in the frequency range from 40 Hz to 6 MHz. The dc electrical conductivity was estimated from the Cole-Cole plot and the values were found to be 2.19 x 10(-6) Sm-1 at 353K and 1.46 x 10(-6) Sm-1 at 373K respectively. Mechanical studies on the grown crystal revealed that the material belongs to soft materials category. Thermal conductivity and specific heat capacities were estimated by Hot Disk Thermal Constants Analyzer.

AB Atomic layer doped Yb2O3:Er and Yb2Si2O7:Er nanolaminate films are fabricated on silicon by atomic layer deposition, and similar to 1530 nm electroluminescence (EL) is obtained from the metal-oxide-semiconductor light emitting devices (MOSLEDs) based on these films. The Yb2O3 films transfer to Yb2Si2O7 phase after annealing above 1000 degrees C. Intense photoluminescence from Yb2Si2O7 film confirms high efficiency and energy transfer under optical excitation, but the limited electron conduction restricts the EL performance. EL from the Yb2O3:Er MOSLED outperforms, presenting an external quantum efficiency up to 8.5% and the power efficiency of 1 x 10(-3). The EL is derived to result from the impact excitation of Er3+ ions by hot electrons, which stem from Fowler-Nordheim tunneling mechanism under sufficient bias voltage. The critical distance for the cross relaxation of doped Er3+ ions in nanolaminate Yb2O3 matrix is experimentally determined to be similar to 3nm. Such devices manifest the technological potential of Er-doped Yb-oxides for applications in silicon-based optoelectronics.

AB Faraday rotation diamagnetic glass has attracted research attentions in photonics, sensing and magneto optical devices due to their high refractive index, wide transmittance in UV and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) range and temperature independent Faraday rotation. Selenite modified heavy metal oxides glasses with composition of xSeO(2)-(10-x) B2O3-45PbO-45Bi(2)O(3) (x = 0, 1, 5 and 10mol%) and 15%SeO2-40%PbO-45%Bi2O3 have been fabricated by melt-quenching method in present study. The influence of SeO2 on glass forming ability, thermal, mechanical properties and Faraday rotation were evaluated through X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier transforms infrared spectra (FT-IR), Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Vicker's hardness and Verdet constant measurements. XRD spectra reveal that the good vitrification was achieved for glass with SeO2 amounts <= 10% even without B2O3. FT-IR, Raman and XPS spectra ascertain the existence of characteristic vibration of SeO4, SeO3, PbO4, BiO3 and BO3 units. The incorporation of SeO2 increases the connectivity of glassy network by increasing the T-g, thermal stability and mechanical hardness. The small band gap, high polarizable Se4+ ions and isolated SeO3 units contribute to Faraday rotation improvement.

AB Nowadays, the advanced photon management is regarded as an area of intensive research investment. Ever since the most widely used commercial photovoltaic cells are fabricated with single gap semiconductors like silicon, photon management has offered opportunities to make better use of the photons, both inside and outside the single junction window. In this study, the impact of new down shifting layer on the photoelectrical parameters of silicon based solar cell was studied. An effort to enhance the photovoltaic performance of textured silicon solar cells through the application of porous SiC particles-doped polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) layers using the spin-coating technique, is reported. Current-voltage curves under artificial illumination were used to confirm the contribution of LDS (SiC-PVA) thin layers. Experiment results revealed that LDS based on SiC particles which were etched in HF/K2S2O8 solution at T = 80 degrees C under UV light of 254 nm exhibited the best solar cell photoelectrical parameters due to its strong photoluminescence.

AB Flexible polymer dispersed liquid crystal (F-PDLC) devices were fabricated using transparent conducting ITO/ PET film. Polymerization induced phase separation (PIPS) method was used for pure and ferroelectric BaTiO3 (BTO) and ZnO doped PDLC devices. The distribution of nanoparticles in the PDLC and the formation of micro cavities were studied using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). It was observed that the addition of ferroelectric BTO nanoparticles has reduced the threshold voltage (V-th) and saturation voltage (V-sat) of F-NP-PDLC by 85% and 41% respectively due to the spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric nanoparticles. The ferroelectric properties of BTO and ZnO in the fabricated devices were investigated using dynamic contact electrostatic force microscopy (DC EFM). Flexing the device can generate a potential due to the piezo-tribo electric effect of the ferroelectric nanomaterial doped in the PDLC matrix, which could be utilized as an energy generating system. The switching voltage after multiple flexing was also studied and found to be in par with non flexing situations.

AB Planar and multilayered photonic devices offer unprecedented opportunities in biological and chemical sensing due to strong light-matter interactions. However, uses of rigid substances such as semiconductors and dielectrics confront photonic devices with issues of biocompatibility and a mechanical mismatch for their application on humid, uneven, and soft biological surfaces. Here, we report that favorable material traits of natural silk protein led to the fabrication of an ultra-thin, conformal, and water-permeable (hydratable) metal-insulator-metal (MIM) color absorber that was mapped on soft, curved, and hydrated biological interfaces. Strong absorption was induced in the MIM structure and could be tuned by hydration and tilting of the sample. The transferred MIM color absorbers reached the exhibition of a very strong resonant absorption in the visible and near infra-red ranges. In addition, we demonstrated that the conformal resonator could function as a refractometric glucose sensor applied on a contact lens.

AB A cellulose-assisted, liquid-phase precursor (LPP) was used to synthesize a YAG phosphor radiating near 530 nm with a particle size of 400 nm, which may be implemented in many applications. The mixture of the materials was homogeneous, and the cellulose-assisted LPP method involved a liquid-phase reaction at a lower temperature compared to a solid-state reaction (SSR). The reaction was performed at 1200, 1300 and 1400 degrees C, and the composition ratio of the samples was controlled based on yttrium (L1: 2.7, L2: 2.8, L3: 2.9, L4: 2.95, and L5: 3.1 M). similar to 400 nm particles were obtained at 1200 degrees C and-1 mu m at 1300 degrees C. At 1200 degrees C, the PL intensity was the highest in the Y3.1Al5O12 sample. At 1300 and 1400 degrees C, the strongest intensity was evident in the Y2.9Al(5)O(12) sample.

AB In this research, SnO2@SWCNTs@Reduced Graphene Oxide based nanocomposite was synthesized by a one step hydrothermal method and reported new cost effective platinum-free counter-electrodes (CEs) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The CEs were formed by using the nanocomposites with the help of a pipette using a doctor blade technique. The efficiency of this nanocomposite revealed significant elctrocatalytic properties upon falling the triiodide, possessing to synergistic effect of SnO2 nano particles and improved conductivity when SWCNTs dispersed on graphene sheet. Therefore, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of prepared SnO2@SWCNTs@ RGO nanocomposite CE attained of (6.1%) in DSSCs which is equivalent to the value (6.2%) which attained to the value (6.2%) with pure Pt CE as a reference. SnO2@SWCNTs@RGO nanocomposite CEs give more stable catalytic activities for triiodide reduction than SnO2 and SWCNTs CEs in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis. Furthermore, to the subsistence of graphene oxide, the nanocomposite acquired both higher stability and efficiency in the nanocomposite.

AB This research presents an efficient technique to enhance the catalytic activity, surface area and total basicity of CaO with hydration-dehydration process to be the catalyst for the transesterification of palm oil to biodiesel. The catalytic performance of the resulted catalyst was tested via transesterification reaction of palm oil at room temperature (30 +/- 2 degrees C) and was compared against commercial CaO and CaO derived from natural calcium carbonate sources. Under the optimal reaction conditions (catalyst loading of 5 wt%, methanol to oil molar ratio 12:1), FAME yields were approximately 94% for CaOHY and 60.5%, 55.3%, 49.5% and 51.4% for CaOcom, CaOegg, CaOgol and CaOriv, as catalysts, respectively. Catalyst reusability and scaling up of biodiesel production from 50 mL to 1.5 L were also investigated. The obtained biodiesel product after purification and treatment process showed high quality fuel properties within the range of biodiesel standard and similar with high-speed diesel. Furthermore, the used CaOHY as a solid heterogeneous catalyst at room temperature was not only low-cost but also environmentally-friendly, showing a high potential in the biodiesel production.

AB The solar energy share in Sweden will grow up significantly in next a few decades. Such transition offers not only great opportunity but also uncertainties for the emerging solar photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) technologies. This paper therefore aims to conduct a techno-economic evaluation of a reference solar PV/T concentrator in Sweden for building application. An analytical model is developed based on the combinations of Monte Carlo simulation techniques and multi energy-balance/financial equations, which takes into account of the integrated uncertainties and risks of various variables. In the model, 11 essential input variables, i.e. average daily solar irradiance, electrical/thermal efficiency, prices of electricity/heating, operation & management (OM) cost, PV/T capital cost, debt to equity ratio, interest rate, discount rate, and inflation rate, are considered, while the economic evaluation metrics, such as levelized cost of energy (LCOE), net present value (NPV), and payback period (PP), are primarily assessed. According to the analytical results, the mean values of LCOE, NPV and PP of the reference PV/T connector are observed at 1.27 SEK/kW h (0.127 (sic)/kW h), 18,812.55 SEK (1881.255 (sic)) and 10 years during its 25 years lifespan, given the project size at 10.37 m(2) and capital cost at 4482-5378 SEK/m(2) (448.2-537.8 (sic)/m(2)). The positive NPV indicates that the investment on the selected PV/T concentrator will be profitable as the projected earnings exceeds the anticipated costs, depending on the NPV decision rule. The sensitivity analysis and the parametric study illustrate that the economic performance of the reference PV/T concentrator in Sweden is mostly proportional to solar irradiance, debt to equity ratio and heating price, but disproportionate to capital cost and discount rate. Together with additional market analysis of PV/T technologies in Sweden, it is expected that this paper could clarify the economic situation of PV/T technologies in Sweden and provide a useful model for their further investment decisions, in order to achieve sustainable and low-carbon economics, with an expanded quantitative discussion of the real economic or policy scenarios that may lead to those outcomes.

AB The Linear Joule Engine Generator (LJEG) incorporates the Joule Engine technology and the permanent magnet linear alternator design, which is a promising power generation device for the applications of range extenders for electric vehicles, Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems, or as a stand-alone power unit. It combines the advantages from both a Joule Engine and a linear alternator, i.e. high efficiency, compact in size, and flexible to renewable energy integration, etc. In this paper, the background and recent developments of the LJEGs are summarised. A detailed 0-dimentional numerical model is described for the evaluation of the system dynamics and thermodynamic characteristics. Model validation is conducted using the test data obtained from both a reciprocating Joule Engine and a LJEG prototype, which proved to be in good agreement with the simulation results. The fundamental operational characteristics of the system were then explained using the validated numerical model. It was found that the piston displacement profile has certain similarity with a sinusoidal wave function with an amplitude of 51.0 mm and a frequency of 13 Hz. The electric power output from the linear alternator can reach 4.4 kW(e). The engine thermal efficiency can reach above 34%, with an electric generating efficiency of 30%.

AB Co-pyrolysis of CV and KW under CO2 atmosphere were studied in this paper. The pyrolysis characteristics were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis and the kinetic parameters were calculated by Ozawa-Flynn-Wall and the Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose methods. Results showed that with the increase of mixing degree, the averaged apparent activation energy (E-ave) increased evidently, the 50%CV50%KW sample showed the highest Eave (234.43 kJ/mol (OFW) and 228.21 kJ/mol (KAS)). Yields of liquid, solid and gas at different pyrolysis temperature and blends were obtained by a lab-scale fixed bed reactor. Both KW and CV had the highest bio-oil yield at 600 degrees C in the range of 500-700 degrees C. Mixing KW and CV deteriorated the bio-oil yield but improved higher heating value of the bio-oil product (33.9 MJ/kg at 600 degrees C in 5:5 ratios). The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of bio-oil product further found that co-pyrolysis of CV and KW could decrease carboxylic acids and increased hydrocarbons of bio-oil products. In brief, co-pyrolysis of CV and KW could be a potential way for improving quality and calorific value of pyrolysis oil.

AB The blends of n-butanol and diesel are easy to achieve the premixed low-temperature combustion (PLTC) without larger exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate to maintain combustion stability and reduce emissions. Engine experiment and numerical modeling coupled with a new reduced mechanism were used to investigate both combustion and emission characteristics of D100 (pure diesel) and B30 (30% n-butanol and 70% diesel) under different intake oxygen concentrations (IOCs: 21%, 19%, 17%, and 15%). With the decrease in IOC, the maximum heat release rate (HRR) of D100 increased, while the maximum HRR of B30 first increased and then decreased. NOx emissions of two fuels differed slightly and both significantly decreased. Soot emission of D100 increased, while that of B30 first increased and then decreased. Moreover, under the same IOC, soot emission of B30 was less than that of D100. The chemical kinetic analysis shows that the addition of n-butanol consumed a certain amount of OH, slowed down the oxidation of n-heptane and toluene, and finally prolonged the ignition delay period. Additionally, decreasing in IOC suppressed the low-temperature O-2-addition reactions of n-heptane and n-butanol to retard the reaction processes, prolonging the ignition delay. The numerical results show that as the decrease in IOC, the combustion rate decreased, the timings taken for the complete consumption of reactants and the formation of important intermediate products (CH2O, CO, H2O2, and OH) as well as soot precursors (C2H2, A(1), and A(4)) were significantly delayed. Besides, the maximum mass fractions of CH2O, CO, and H2O2 increased, while the maximum OH mass fraction decreased. The formation of soot precursors exhibited similar trends, and reached the maximum mass fraction at an IOC of 17%. Specifically, the increase in soot emission of B30 was caused by the decrease in oxidation, while the decrease was mainly induced by the decrease in formation.

AB Dual-injection engines, which allow real-time control and injection of two different fuels, are capable of varying the ratio of biofuel blends at different engine operating conditions for optimal engine performance. However, while many experiments have been carried out on these engines to demonstrate their advantages, very few studies have focused on the corresponding air fuel ratio (AFR) control strategy. In order to achieve stable engine operation, it is essential to maintain transient AFR during the change of fuel blend ratio. Therefore, this study proposes an adaptive controller for AFR control of dual-injection engines. The proposed controller is designed based on a recently developed machine learning method called extreme learning machine, and its stability is verified with Lyapunov analysis. Simulations have been performed on an industry-level engine simulation software to verify the controller. Since dual-injection engines are not available in the market, a spark-ignition engine has been retrofitted for dual-injection operation so that the proposed controller can be implemented and evaluated experimentally. Both simulation and experiment results show that the proposed controller can effectively regulate the AFR to desired level. The results also show that the proposed controller outperforms the engine built-in AFR controller, indicating its significance for dual-injection engines.

AB In this paper, an integrated structure of cogeneration and freshwater production for residential complexes usage in an industrial town of Assaluyeh, in south of Iran and besides to the Persian Gulf is developed and analyzed. In this process, solar flat plate collectors on the houses roof to provide the required thermal energy, Kalina cycle to generate integrated power and a multi-stage desalination process for the freshwater production of residential complexes, are utilized. The proposed system is simulated through TRNSYS, HYSYS, and MATLAB Software. This integrated structure has the capability of simultaneous production of 1869 kW power, 65194 kW heating and 83.22 kg/s freshwater for residential complexes. Based on the results the integrated structure has a total thermal efficiency of 44.64% and a total exergy efficiency of 90.04%. Exergy analysis shows that the highest amount of exergy destruction on a specific day of the year, the percentage of the destructed exergy from the input exergy flow, occurs in the solar flat collectors and the auxiliary boiler, 54.72%, 21.89%, respectively. By sensitivity analysis of the important indices for the developed integrated structure, including the number of collectors, the mass flow rate of the collector and the molar composition of the Kalina power generation cycle, an appropriate solution is proposed to improve the modeling effective parameters.

AB In this work we have optimized the operation of a geothermal facility. Benzene, toluene and cyclohexane are selected as candidate fluids based on previous studies. We formulated a superstructure optimization problem for the optimal use of geothermal energy using a binary cycle with either one or two turbine expansions. Surrogate correlations for the thermodynamic properties of the fluids have been developed (i.e. enthalpy, entropy) to model the operation of the turbine and the heat exchanger network. A single economic objective and a normalized multiobjective function accounting for economic, environmental and safety issues are used. The economic optimization selects a two expansion cycle using toluene as organic fluid, producing 10.4 MW at 0.075 (sic) kWh with an investment of 102 M(sic) Safety considerations slightly change the operating conditions, reducing the pressures and temperatures, but not the selection of the working fluid. Sustainable and economic terms overcome safety issues. The results are competitive with other renewable-based technologies for thermal power production such as CSP or biomass.

AB This study was aimed at comprehensively analyzing the exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental performance of a continuous reactor applied to synthesize fuel additive (acetins) by glycerol esterification with acetic acid in the presence of Amberlyst 36 catalyst. The effects of various process parameters viz. esterification temperature, acetic acid/glycerol molar ratio, and reaction pressure on both exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental variables were studied at a constant feed flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. In addition, an optimization study was conducted using response surface methodology (RSM) through minimizing both cost and environmental impact per exergy unit of the product. Overall, both acetic acid/glycerol molar ratio and esterification temperature had profound effects on the variables of both exergy-based methods, while reaction pressure trivially affected the output parameters. The optimum operating conditions were: acetic acid/glycerol molar ratio = 1.1:1, esterification temperature = 102.0 degrees C, and reaction pressure = 16.7 bar. Under these conditions, the cost and environmental impact per exergy unit of the product were found to be 218.11 USD/GJ and 171.40 mPts/GJ, respectively. Generally, noticeable differences were observed in the optimum operating conditions proposed based on the process yield compared with those suggested by the exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental methods.

AB This paper presents an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC)-assisted ground source heat pump combisystem for the cascaded utilization of low-grade energy and shallow geothermal energy in cold regions. The ORC unit was added to conventional ground source heat pumps to solve the cold accumulation problem, which can lead to performance degradation of heat pumps. The existing types and novel types of the combisystem were then modeled with the Transient System Simulation Program (TRNSYS). During the heating season, the ORC unit and heat pump unit were combined for space heating, and during the non-heating season, the ORC unit was connected to ground heat exchangers for seasonal storage. System performance was simulated over periods of one year and twenty years. The twenty-year simulation results showed that the proposed combisystem could maintain a higher annual average coefficient of performance (COP) of approximately 3.8 because of the steady soil temperature, whereas the annual average COP of the conventional ground source heat pump system decreased from 3.7 to 3.2. Additionally, the total power consumption per unit heating area of the heating system decreased from 2.2 x 10(3) kW.h/m(2) to 3.3 x 10(2) kW.h/m(2) when the ORC unit was added to the conventional ground source heat pump. This translates to electricity cost savings of (sic) 908/m(2) over twenty years. Moreover, in the combisystem, the ORC unit provides 55.6% of the total heating capacity; compensates for 78.5% of the heat pump unit's power consumption. And 94.1% of the thermal energy storage from the non-heating season can be used during the heating season by the heat pump unit.

AB Microcogeneration systems guarantee the reduction of primary energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in residential sector, by reducing fossil fuels demand and grid losses with respect to conventional energy conversion systems. Energy, environmental and economic benefits can be obtained sharing the cogenerated thermal and electric energy among different end-users to increase the operating hours of the microcogeneration plant with respect to the scenario in which energy demand of each end-user is satisfied by a single cogeneration system. This paper analyses a microcogeneration system used to satisfy electric, space heating and domestic hot water demands of two separate residential buildings located in Spain in a load sharing approach. It consists of a natural gas fuelled internal combustion engine with a thermal and electric power of 12.5 kW and 5.5 kW, respectively. An auxiliary boiler with a nominal thermal power of 24 kW, is also included. The domestic hot water and the heating requirements are managed by means of two different thermal energy storages. The proposed energy conversion systems were experimentally analysed in a test facility in Vitoria Gasteiz (Spain). The models representing the components and the buildings have been implemented in TRNSYS 17. The energy, environmental and economic performance of proposed system are compared with those achieved by a traditional system based on separated energy production. The results highlight that the load sharing between users with different load profiles leads to better environmental and thermo-economic results with respect to the conventional system. The microcogeneration plant works for about 3000 hours per year achieving a primary energy saving of 12.1% and a reduction of equivalent CO2 emissions equal to 27.8%. The payback period of the analysed solution is equal to 11.9 years unless economic support mechanisms are considered. The results of this study show that the introduction of a microcogeneration system in load sharing approach leads to energy, environmental and economic benefits even considering two separate residential buildings, occupied by users with different behaviour.

AB Degradation decreases photovoltaic power delivery capacity over time. Studies on photovoltaic degradation are usually based on accelerated tests or filed tests which are time-consuming and require much effort. This paper investigates the degradation process of photovoltaic modules by simulation studies. A circuit-based model is employed to describe photovoltaic characteristics to environmental conditions and to the aging factors of photovoltaic modules, Analysis of each aging factor shows that the decrease of short-circuit current, the main reason of power loss, is mainly caused by optical degradation. The decay of fill factor mainly due to degradation of parasitic resistances worsens the power output. The statistical analysis of photovoltaic characteristic parameters based on a great number of photovoltaic modules with the same technology indicates that the degradation process can be very complicated depending on the degradation patterns of aging factors. Generally, the power loss tends to increase and the mismatch among photovoltaic modules becomes more remarkable through the time.

AB Transformation optics based metamaterial thermal harvesting devices, which provides power and efficiency related advantages by manipulating and concentrating thermal fluxes, have attracted considerable research interests. The potential utilizations are significant for improving the energy conversion efficiencies in existing collecting technologies including heat storages, solar thermal collectors, full cells, etc. However, most of the current researches on thermal harvesting devices are mainly focused on continuous shape profiles based on the scattering cancellation. In this paper, we propose a novel method for fabricating desirable polygonal thermal harvesting devices with homogeneous and nonsingular parameters through linear mapping function. Four polygonal concentrating schemes with fewer kinds of natural materials filling inside the functional regions are demonstrated in transient states. The expected harvesting performances are achieved for each proposed polygonal scheme. Furthermore, the proposed thermal harvesting performances are investigated as a function of the dense degree of the medium-layer configurations. In general, this paper demonstrates a novel method for designing non-continuous shape polygon harvesting devices with corresponding validations. Improved concentrating behaviors would be achieved with denser medium configurations, implemented as appropriately arranged fractions. The findings could have potentials for designing novel transformation optics devices and providing improved energy conversion efficiencies in existing collecting technologies.

The new quasi-dimensional flame tracking model is able to simulate the turbulent combustion process in premixed fuel/air/residual gas mixtures. A new method for the description of the geometry of the combustion chamber and flame front was developed enabling the visualisation of flame front movement across the combustion chamber. The control of local turbulence quantities in the flame front near the wall enables that the developed flame tracking model can predict the entire turbulent combustion process after the flame kernel development in spark-ignition engines without case-dependent calibration requirement. The developed quasi dimensional combustion model was validated with the experimental and results of multidimensional model of a single cylinder spark ignition engine on averaged cycles. The model was integrated with the previously developed ignition, mixture stratification and cyclic variability sub-model that enable the simulation of cyclic combustion variability triggered by the stochastic variations of flow angle at the spark plug, mixture stratification and in-cylinder turbulence level. Due to the novelty of the model which includes the control of local integral length scale and turbulent kinetic energy in the flame segments the predictive capability of quasi-dimensional model is achieved with the application of single set of parameters related to average cycle and cyclic combustion variability. Flame tracking model with the low computational time represents a promising tool to calculate the turbulent combustion process including cyclic combustion variability in modern spark ignition engines.

AB Ground source heat pump systems that are installed in areas with heating or cooling dominant seasons, or in buildings with utilization characteristics that lead to a disparity in demand, often encounter challenges related to ground thermal imbalance. This imbalance can lead to long-term ground temperature changes and may cause premature system failure. This paper focuses on combining a ground source heat pump system with a solar thermal array, with the goal of eliminating the effect of ground thermal imbalance, and minimizing system lifetime cost. A thermal mass ground heat transfer model is combined with a time-stepping model to analyze the system for a variety of solar array sizes. The details associated with this modelling technique are presented, and case studies are provided to illustrate the results of the calculations for three different buildings. It is shown that increasing the solar array size can offset ground thermal imbalances, but increasing the array size also results in a larger initial system cost. An economic analysis is then carried out to determine the system lifetime cost as a function of this solar array size, and an optimal array size from an economic perspective was found. The result of the study shows that hybridizing a ground source heat pump system with a solar array produces a viable system from a technical and economic standpoint, can be used to avoid premature system failure, and can reduce system lifetime cost.

AB To defossilize the current liquid energy backbone a sustainable renewable substitute for fossil crude oil is required. The long-term aim is to increase the co-feed of renewables beyond the current level. However, technical constrains and certain properties limit the conventional biogenic co-feed level to less than 10%.
   The potential of identifying refinery compatible entry points to directly co-feed bio-based refinery intermediates and further co-process in existing petroleum crude oil refineries is investigated in the current study. The studied pyrolysis bio-oil has been upgraded via mild hydrotreatment (HDT) in order to fulfil specifications and become a "drop-in" biofuel in compatible refinery "location". The properties of HDT-Bio-oil as well as fossil based refinery intermediates were compared and five fossil-based refinery intermediates have been concluded as potential candidates for co-processing. The miscibility of the aforementioned renewable and conventional fuels has been investigated. Among all refinery streams, Fluid Catalytic Cracking Light Cycle Oil (FCC LCO) and secondly Light Vacuum Gas Oil (LVGO) have been concluded to be the most promising candidates for co-processing, resembling HDT-Bio-oil's properties.

AB Exergy is a quantity of the work potential of energy from a given thermodynamic condition. Unlike energy, exergy can be destroyed, and for gasoline engines, the major source of this destruction is during the combustion process. Therefore, to assess the quality of gasoline engines, the research team examined the effect of inlet temperature and spark timing on chemical, thermo-mechanical and total exergy of fuel using E0, E20, E40, E60 and E85 fuels. Results showed that by advancing the spark timing (20 bTDC), thermo-mechanical exergy has increased but chemical exergy and total exergy have decreased. In addition, advance or delay In spark timing had no effect on the fuel chemical exergy for the compression and expansion strokes. The effect of temperature on exergy parameters indicated that by reducing inlet temperature (320 K), exergy parameters increased. In other words, the fuel chemical exergy at 320 K for E0, E20, E40, E60 and E85 fuels, increased by 7%, 7.1%, 7.2%, 7.2%, 7.3%, respectively, than 350 K and increased by 14%, 14.3%, 14.4%, 14.4% and 14.5% than 380 K.

AB The variable temperature characteristics of isobaric phase transition process for zeotropic mixture can effectively reduce the heat transfer irreversibility between working fluids and heat sources or heat sinks for thermodynamic cycle systems. One of the key problems in the application of zeotropic mixtures for power generation systems is how to determine their optimal components and compositions. The traditional method is mainly based on the exhaustive method, which means that every considered component and their compositions in the mixture are optimized one by one and mainly caused by the independence and discontinuity of components. This process will consume a large amount of computing resources, which limits the optimization of zeotropic mixtures. In order to describe the discrete components and optimize them, the selective coefficient representing every component alternative is introduced and this paper recommends a simultaneous approach to achieve the optimal components and compositions of zeotropic mixture at the same time. Two case studies with different heat sources and sinks as well as system layouts are illustrated to show the proposed approach. Besides, it also proves the systems with zeotropic mixture have better performance than that of systems with pure fluid.

AB Renewable energy systems can play a key role in sustainable energy supply. Because of the fluctuating electricity generation, storage technologies are needed to close the gap between demand and supply. Besides the electricity sector, the transport sector causes high energy demand. In this context, because of their remoteness, islands can be seen as blueprints for possible energy transition pathways. The objective of this paper is to analyse different principle concepts that come into question for a 100% renewable subtropical island from the distribution system operator's point of view. This perspective offers the possibility to account all system costs needed to transfer a centralised energy system into a 100% renewable one and to assume the macroeconomic costs of such a transfer. For the case of La Gomera the economic competitiveness of renewable energy, particularly solar PV and wind power, is shown. All evaluated sustainable scenarios lead to lower annual cost and primary energy demands than the business-of-usual (BAU) scenario based on the cost assumptions used in this study. The analysis underlines that the combination of different technologies will lead to the lowest primary energy demand and to the lowest annualised cost of 10.89 M(sic) for the entire island energy system, which is 37.2% lower than a BAU scenario.

AB Isopropanol-butanol-ethanol (IBE) can be used in engines as an alternative fuel to eliminate the high recovery and separation costs in the production of butanol and also to avoid the corrosivity and low flash point of acetone in acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE). In this respect, this study is aimed to investigate the performance, combustion and emissions of a single-cylinder, common-rail diesel engine fueled with IBE and diesel blends. Two blends of butanol and diesel fuel, denoted as IBE15 (15% IBE and 85% diesel in volume) and IBE30 (30% IBE and 70% diesel in volume) were tested. Additionally, the experiments in this study were conducted at different diluted gas ratios to achieve low NOx emission. The experimental results show that when the intake charger is gradually diluted, the start of combustion and combustion center for all the tested fuels are remarkably delayed. Compared with pure diesel, the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) for IBE15 is always higher. Butt for IBE30, the STE is lower than that of pure diesel when the flow rate of the dilute gas is less than 30 L/min. For all the tested fuels, NOx emission reduces while CO and HC emissions increase with the increase of dilute gas. Soot emission for pure diesel and IBE15 drastically increases as the dilute gas increases. However, the increase of dilute gas does not cause the soot emission of IBE30 to significant increase. That is to say, IBE30 coupled with a proper EGR ratio has the potential to reduce NOx and soot emissions simultaneously.

AB In this work, a satellite heat pipe operated with the ammonia and methanol are investigated for the multi objective optimization. Optimization results are used for the comparative analysis of both the heat pipe. Optimization problem of the heat pipe is formed considering minimization of the thermal resistance and total mass of heat pipe and solved using the heat transfer search algorithm. An application example of satellite heat pipe is presented, and results are obtained in the form of Pareto-optimal points. Seven geometric parameters which include the length of evaporator and condenser section, tube wall thickness, vapor core diameter, mesh number of wick, thickness of wick, and diameter of wick wire are investigated in the optimization study. Further, the effect of condenser temperature, heat load, and length of the adiabatic section on ammonia and methanol heat pipe is explored and discussed. Furthermore, the effect of the design variables and its sensitivity to performance parameters of the heat pipe are also presented. Comparative results revel that, for any given value of the total mass of heat pipe, 82.17-57.16% lower thermal resistance is observed with the ammonia heat pipe as compared to methanol heat pipe. Finally, uncertainty propagation analysis of the obtained Pareto solutions are carried out with the different uncertainty levels and observed that the results have relatively good robustness performance for uncertainty less than 5%.

AB Adsorption technology is recognised to be a promising CO2 capture method due to its desirable characteristics e.g. reusable nature of adsorbents, low capital investment and easy automatic operation. To further improve thermal performance, internal heat recovery is adopted for adsorption CO2 capture through analogy with adsorption refrigeration. Based on carbon pump theory, thermal performance of 4-step temperature swing adsorption (TSA) processes is analysed at various adsorption/desorption temperatures and pressures. Exergy efficiency of adsorption CO2 capture with and without heat recovery will be evaluated and compared by using experimental adsorption characteristics of activated carbon. Metal part and unused percentage of adsorption reactor are defined to further assess their influence on system performance in real application. Results indicate that sensible heat of adsorbents and adsorbed phase account for the major part of heat consumption. For different desorption/adsorption temperatures and pressures, theoretical exergy efficiency of 4-step TSA cycle ranges from 0.022 to 0.221. Heat recovery is conducive to exergy efficiency. Through heat recovery, exergy efficiency could be improved from 54.3% to 84.6% when mass ratio increases from 0 to 8. Similarly, the improvement by using heat recovery is up to 90% in terms of different unused percentages.

AB Multi-generation systems are promising technologies for multiple production applications to reduce the waste heat of the basic system. For this purpose, a novel multi-generation system using geothermal heat source is proposed which produces different commodities of cooling, heating, power and freshwater, simultaneously. The system comprises of a Kalina cycle, an absorption refrigeration cycle, a humidification-dehumidification desalination system, and a domestic water heater unit system. Exergoeconomic optimization of the proposed system is conducted, showing that the optimum thermal efficiency, exergy efficiency and total SUCP (sum unit cost of the product) can be obtained 94.84%, 47.89%, and 89.95 $/GJ, respectively. Moreover, a comprehensive parametric study showed that the Gained-Output-Ratio, freshwater, thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency can be optimized based on the desalination mass flow rate ratio. In addition, it is demonstrated that a higher thermal efficiency can be obtained by increasing vapour generator pinch point temperature difference, turbine inlet pressure, and evaporator temperature or decreasing condenser temperature, absorber temperature, basic ammonia concentration, desalination top temperature, desalination bottom temperature, and heater terminal temperature difference. Whereas, a higher exergy efficiency can be attained at high evaporator temperature, basic ammonia concentration, and desalination bottom temperature or low vapour generator pinch point temperature difference, turbine inlet pressure, condenser temperature, absorber temperature, desalination top temperature, and heater terminal temperature difference.

AB Exhaust gases remaining inside the engine cylinder after the exhaust stroke premix with fresh air-fuel combustible mixture and affect combustion process in the engine cylinder. Due to significantly higher temperature of these exhaust residuals (ExR) compared to the external exhaust gases recirculation (EGR), their impact on the in cylinder combustion process is also different from impact of EGR. To control amounts of ExR independent of engine working parameters, the variable valve timing was introduced. It is known that variable valve timing affects not only volumetric efficiency and performance of the internal combustion reciprocating engine but also influences the amount of exhaust residuals remaining in the engine cylinder. These exhaust residuals impact combustion rates, combustion stability, knock and also play crucial role on exhaust toxic emissions. In this manuscript, the effect of variable valve overlap was studied on A. exhaust toxic emission (NOx, CO and THC), and B. combustion phasing and engine performance on a spark ignited natural gas fueled engine.
   The investigation was carried out in a single cylinder research engine at constant load. The engine was equipped with high authority dual independent cam phasors for both intake and exhaust values, but for the purpose of this study, the exhaust valve timing was fixed and intake valve timing was changed to vary the amount of exhaust residuals remaining in the engine cylinder. The correlation between valve overlap and exhaust residuals were determined. It was observed that correlation in the positive overlap range between 55 and 85 deg was almost positive linear. Regarding toxic exhaust emission, increase in exhaust residuals from 9.6 to 12.3% (change by 28%) caused reduction in NOx by 67% and increase in both CO and THC by approximately 75%. Additionally, it did not significantly affect the engine's specific fuel consumption. Summarizing, strong correlation between in-cylinder exhaust residuals and toxic emissions, and combustion phases exists in the methane fueled spark ignited engine equipped with VVT.

AB A thermoelectric distillation system has recently been demonstrated to have a great potential of improving the efficiency of distillation processes due to the use of waste heat from the hot side of thermoelectric module to assist evaporation while the cold side for condensation. This work investigates the key factors that affect the water production in a thermoelectric distillation system. An experimental investigation was performed to investigate the influence of evaporation temperature, vapour volume, Peltier current and input power on the water production rate. The results of the experiment show that an increase in the sample water temperature from 30 degrees C to 60 degrees C led to an increase in total water production by 47%. In addition, an increase in total water production by 58% was obtained by reducing the vapour volume from 600 cm(3) to 400 cm(3) during a 3-h operation. The maximum water production rate is achieved by appropriate selection and control of the Peltier current to the thermoelectric device based on the operating condition of the distillation system.

AB An optimized design for a solar absorption-subcooled compression hybrid cooling system used in low-rise buildings is complicated because of the overall considerations involving increases in investment costs and energy savings, which are associated with an increase in the size of the absorption subsystem. To this end, this paper's main contribution lies in its exergoeconomic-optimized design of a solar absorption-subcooled compression hybrid cooling system employed in low-rise buildings for different design cases. In this paper, not only the minimum product-cost flow rate but also the lowest relative cost difference is taken as the objective function owing to the notable changes in fuel cost flow rates. The results of the exergoeconomic optimization shows that the actual cooling capacity of the absorption subsystem should not be designed based only on the maximum collector area. Instead, the actual installed collector area should be determined by the optimal cooling capacity of the absorption subsystem. It was also found that the optimal cooling capacity of the absorption subsystem strongly depends on solar irradiance and cooling demands. In addition, optimal sizes for the absorption subsystem should be designed according to the different minimum product cost flow rates or the lowest relative cost difference, and this difference is sensitive to the local mean solar irradiance but weakly relies on the cooling demand. The paper is helpful in its cost-effective design for a solar absorption-subcooled compression hybrid cooling system used in low-rise buildings.

AB Two dual-chamber microbial fuel cells (MFCs) that use dynamic membranes as separators were designed for power production. The performance of these dynamic membrane microbial fuel cells (DM-MFCs) was studied. Compared to an up-flow dual-chamber MFC (U-MFC), at the total volume of 1.1 L, DM-MFCs achieved a higher maximum power density (1923 mW m(-3) versus 856 mW m(-3)). This is because the DM-MFCs have lower membrane resistance (0.6-5.4 Omega), oxygen diffusion coefficient (D-0 = 1.8 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1)), and cost (0.3 USD m(-2)) than other reported separators; e.g., anion exchange membrane (ACM), cation exchange membrane (CEM), ultrafiltration membrane (UFM), and J-cloth. The dynamic membrane is primarily composed of filamentous bacteria and vorticellidae-like protozoa, which tightly attach to the nylon supporting layer. This microorganism layer consumes most of the dissolved oxygen and prevents oxygen transfer from the cathode chamber to the anode chamber, leading to the low D-0 value of the dynamic membrane. Power production of DM-MFCs was further optimized by increasing the NaCl concentration in the influent and the electrode area. The results show that DM-MFCs are feasible and suitable for scaling-up because of their sleeve-shaped configuration. These results indicate that dynamic membranes can be used to increase power production in MFCs relative to traditional separators and DM-MFCs are promising tools for practical applications.

AB A series of modified hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) supported by various Ni loading (5 wt% Ni, 10 wt% Ni, 40 wt% Ni and 100 wt% Ni) have been synthesized and systematically characterized. The resultant Ni catalysts improved the performance of the deoxygenation (DO) of triolein at a reaction temperature of 380 degrees C in a simple glass batch reactor under a solvent-free condition and are hydrogen-free. The incorporation of Ni loading into the HMS framework casued the catalytic activity to increase when compared to that of HMS. Surprisingly, 10 wt % Ni/HMS catalyst exhibited the highest conversion. It was observed that 10 wt% Ni loading was highly dispersed on the HMS which is capable of achieving 92.5% and 95.2% of conversion and selectivity, respectively. This is due to the synergistic effect of Si-O-Ni bonding and high dispersion of NiO on HMS. In this respect, the nature of catalyst support such as pore size and the high surface areas of HMS play an important role in enhancing the catalytic performance of DO reaction. This study has revealed that Ni/HMS catalyst is a promising catalyst that can be applied to the development of sustainable biofuel from non-edible oil.

Characterization through X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and energy disperse X-ray analysis (EDX), and Brunauer-EmmettTeller analysis (BET) were carried out to understand the physiochemical activity of the catalysts in pyrolysis of rice husk. The catalyst to rice husk ratio of 0.1 was pyrolyzed in the temperature range of 323-1173 K using thermogravimetric analyzer coupled with mass spectrometer (TGA-MS) equipment to investigate the effect of catalysts in thermal degradation behavior of biomass and syngas production. The study revealed that lowest coke formation (3.65 wt%) associated with high syngas (68.3 vol%) were attained in catalytic pyrolysis using coal bottom ash catalyst compared to nickel and natural zeolite catalysts. Moreover, the hydrogen concentration had increased 8.4 vol% in catalytic pyrolysis of rice husk using coal bottom ash catalyst compared to non-catalytic pyrolysis.

AB Pyrolysis is considered to be a promising method to dispose waste plastics by thermal cracking into chemicals. Previous studies focus on pyrolysis recycling of waste thermoplastics. The pyrolysis of waste thermosetting plastics, which may be different from that of waste thermoplastics, receives little attention. In order to provide guidance for reactor design and thermo-chemical process management for the pyrolysis recycling of waste thermosetting plastics, the pyrolysis kinetics, volatile products and reaction mechanisms of one typical waste thermosetting plastics namely phenolic fibre-reinforced plastic (phenolic FRP) are studied in the present study. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and online TGA-FTIR-mass spectra (MS) analyses are employed. Results indicate that the pyrolysis of waste phenolic FRP in inert atmosphere may be divided into two stages with the threshold conversion rate of 0.2. The average values of activation energy in the first, second and whole pyrolysis process were 174.66 kJ/mol, 233.62 kJ/mol and 223.22 kJ/mol, respectively. The crosslinking between phenol derivatives and breakage of branched chain may result in the occurrence of the first stage, while the occurrence of the second stage may be due to the breakage of chain backbone and oxidation of methylene and hydroxymethyl. Four kinds of gases including H2O, alcohols, aliphatic compounds and carboxylic acids mainly constitute the volatile products in the first stage. The volatile products in the second stage mainly consist of CO, CO2, carboxylic acids and aromatic compounds. The amount of the volatile products in the second stage is much larger than that in the first stage. The maximum amount of these seven gases in the order of most to least is CO2 > CO > alcohols > carboxylic acids > aliphatic compounds > water vapour > aromatic compounds. It may be better to recover the waste phenolic FRP for valuable gases either as fuel or chemical feedstock in the first stage than the second stage.

AB This study analyzes and compares flicker emission, voltage fluctuations, and mechanical loads for two small-scale wind turbines (WTs), considering different control strategies. The investigated strategies are active yaw and stall control strategies for above rated wind speed operation to limit the captured power. The yaw controller is designed to limit the output power and rotation speed in high wind speeds by rotating the turbine out of the wind direction. On the other hand, the optimal blades are designed for the stall-controlled WT to have appropriate performance in all wind speed regions, especially in the stall region. In this WT, the captured power is regulated by controlling the rotor speed in relation to wind speed via power electronic interface in all wind speed regions without requiring the aerodynamic active devices. The maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms are also implemented in low and moderate wind speeds. A simulation platform is used that considers aerodynamic, mechanical, electrical, and control aspects of the WTs. The MPPT, yaw and stall control, and simulation results are presented and discussed. Results demonstrate that flicker emission level, voltage fluctuation and mechanical loads for the stall-controlled WT are less than those in the yaw-controlled turbine.

AB The application of nanofluids is accounted as an effective way for improving the thermal performance of solar systems. In the current study, MWCNT/thermal oil nanofluid was experimentally tested as a solar heat transfer fluid. A dish collector, using a wounded cylindrical cavity receiver, was considered as the solar system. The main aim of this work was the experimental investigation of the cylindrical cavity's performance, using MWCNT/thermal oil nanofluid. Two experimental models were suggested for the prediction of the cavity's thermal efficiency, by considering MWCNT/thermal oil nanofluid and pure thermal oil in the steady-state period. It was indicated that the heat loss coefficient of the cylindrical cavity receiver decreased by the application of nano fluid. The results revealed the average thermal efficiencies of 63.9% and 56.44% for MWCNT/thermal oil nanofluid and pure thermal oil, respectively. The thermal efficiency was changed form 60.04% to 64.76%, by using the nanofluid, in the steady-state period. Also, it was observed that the thermal performance of the cavity receiver was improved by 13.12%, by using MWCNT/thermal oil nanofluid. Based on the obtained results, the application of MWCNT/oil nanofluid is recommended in the solar dish concentrators with cavity receiver.

AB The optimization criterion for designing the thermodynamic layout of an organic Rankine cycle is often based on either achieving maximum thermodynamic efficiency or incurring minimum initial specific investment costs. Such designs, however, need not lead to the maximum utilization of waste heat potential or an optimal investment. For full potential utilization of a waste heat source, its temperature should be brought down to near ambient temperatures via transfer of enthalpy to the organic Rankine cycle working fluid. In the limit, however, pursuit of complete source utilization may lead to capital intensive organic Rankine cycle layouts that demand infinitesimal temperature gradients in heat exchangers leading to massive heat transfer areas. This paper defines a new objective function that reveals the tradeoffs between specific investment cost and the extent to which waste heat is utilized. A particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize 7 and 8 dimensional search space for pure and mixture based working fluids, respectively, for case studies involving power capacities of 5, 50 and 500 kWe, waste heat source temperatures ranging from 75 to 275 degrees C and a number of working fluids. As a practical aid to designers, a methodology for generating high isentropic efficiency scroll geometries corresponding to optimized cycles is presented, and the optimization analysis is further extended to solar thermal applications.

Multiple floating wicks were used in the basin to enhance the diurnal productivity of the still and mini solar pond was used to supply heat to basin water in batch mode during night to produce nocturnal distillate from the still. The performance of modified still was compared with conventional basin type VMED still under same weather and operating conditions by running both stills simultaneously. Both stills were constructed of same material and dimensions, and consisted of four effects. The diurnal, nocturnal and overall total productivity of modified still was found to be 49.87%, 71.21% and 56.92% respectively, more than the corresponding productivities of conventional still. The daily cumulative efficiency of modified and conventional still was found to be 80.29% and 59.6% respectively, when the total solar radiation on glass cover was 23.1 MJ/m(2)/day, average ambient temperature was 25.3 degrees C and feed rate was 0.13 g/m(2)/s.

AB As an essential issue in wind energy industry, wind speed forecasting plays a vital role in optimal scheduling and control of wind energy generation and conversion. In this paper, a novel method called EnsemLSTM is proposed by using nonlinear-learning ensemble of deep learning time series prediction based on LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory neural networks), SVRM (support vector regression machine) and EO (extremal optimization algorithm). First, in order to avert the drawback of weak generalization capability and robustness of a single deep learning approach when facing diversiform data, a cluster of LSTMs with diverse hidden layers and neurons are employed to explore and exploit the implicit information of wind speed time series. Then predictions of LSTMs are aggregated into a nonlinear-learning regression top-layer composed of SVRM and the EO is introduced to optimize the parameters of the top-layer. Lastly, the final ensemble prediction for wind speed is given by the fine-turning top-layer. The proposed EnsemLSTM is applied on two case studies data collected from a wind farm in Inner Mongolia, China, to perform ten-minute ahead utmost short term wind speed forecasting and one-hour ahead short term wind speed forecasting. Statistical tests of experimental results compared with other popular prediction models demonstrated the proposed EnsemLSTM can achieve a better forecasting performance.

AB Zeotropic mixtures have been widely investigated for the development of Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) as an alternative option for pure fluids. However, few zeotropic mixtures have been applied to the ORC in practical engineering. Therefore, a nature question is that whether zeotropic mixture has better thermodynamic performance of ORC than pure fluid. In this contribution, a comprehensive performance comparison between zeotropic mixtures and pure fluids is conducted via cycle simulation for the basic ORC and recuperative ORC driven by open heat source. In the simulation, a certain range of mass flow rate of cooling water is considered as the condition of heat sink, and mixtures R600a/R601a, R600a/R227ea are employed. Performances of these mixtures are optimized and compared with those of their constituents from the points of first and second laws. It can be concluded that zeotropic mixture may have lower cycle performance than pure fluid. For the optimal mixture R600a/R601a (0.1/0.9, mass fraction) with the highest net power of basic ORC, the cycle efficiency 8.18% is lower than that of R601a 8.24%. Although zeotropic mixture generally has lower temperature differences in the evaporator and condenser, the exergy losses of these heat exchangers are not certain to be reduced. In the basic ORC, the exergy efficiency 34.61% of optimal R600a/R227ea (0.2/0.8, mass fraction) is lower than that of R227ea 35.68%. Furthermore, the introduction of internal heat exchanger (IHE) can enhance the output work and cycle efficiency. The exergy loss in the evaporator and condenser can be reduced by IHE. The mixture with a larger temperature glide can generally recover more heat in the IHE.

AB To explore the alternative resources of traditional energy, ambient-energy scavenging technologies have attracted worldwide attention. In particular, the roadways contain a significant potential for environmental energy harvesting (EEH). In this study, we proposed an innovative road energy harvesting system based on a chessboard sliding plate by using semi-metal friction materials (SMFMs) for collecting the mechanical energy induced by running vehicles. The SMFMs have good frictional properties that enable them to absorb energy well. The proposed system consists of four main components as follows: chessboard sliding plate module, transmission module, micro-generator module and energy storage module. Acting as the energy input mechanism, the chessboard sliding plate module harvests the kinetic energy produced by the friction between the wheel and chessboard plate. The transmission module converts the linear reciprocating motion of the chessboard sliding plate to unidirectional rotation of the input shaft of generator. The energy storage module stores the electric energy generated by the generator module in a supercapacitor. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated through dynamic simulations; the simulation results demonstrate that the system possesses rapid response. Efficiency of 62.38% and 57% are obtained in the simulation and experiments, respectively, validating that the proposed road energy harvesting system is feasible and practical for self-powered applications in road traffic electrical equipment, such as traffic lights, street lamps and speed measuring radar.

AB A new combined biomass and tar gasification model is developed using Aspen Plus. The proposed gasification process consists of four main units: (i) pyrolysis, (ii) combustion, (iii) gasification, and (iv) CO2 absorption. The model predicted product compositions show good agreements (relative error < 6%) with the experimental values under similar operating conditions. The performance of the developed model is evaluated for gasification of three different microalgae species (i) Nannochloropsis oculata, Fucus serrates, and (iii) Scenedesmus almeriensis under various operating conditions. The parametric study is conducted by varying the amount of gasifying agents (steam and oxygen) at three different pressures (1, 40 and 80 bars). Tar from pyrolysis stage is successfully converted into syngas in the combustion zone by adjusting the oxygen flow rate (O-2 ER). The controlled use of oxygen in the combustion zone also improves the gasification performance and system efficiency. The use of steam as a gasifying agent gives high cold gas efficiency and hydrogen production. The increase of pressure has adverse effects on the gasification performance in term of syngas composition, cold gas efficiency and gasification system efficiency. The inclusion of CO2 absorber in the gasification system provides high-quality syngas by removing CO2. The separated pure CO2 can be used as a feedstock for other chemical industries.

AB It is known surrounding a turbine with a diffuser may significantly increase its power. This effect has attained considerable attention as it shows theoretically the possibility of achieving a power coefficient about 2 times greater than an ordinary turbine. However, the effect of the diffuser efficiency has not been implemented into blade element momentum yet. Hence, this paper presents a novel approach to design diffuser-augmented hydro turbines considering the diffuser efficiency. Based on the blade element momentum, new expressions for the axial induction factor and thrust are obtained. To assess the proposed model, a comparative evaluation of two different diffusers (flanged conical diffuser and flanged lens diffuser) is performed. A numerical modeling investigation using computational fluid dynamics is carried out based on the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes formulation, using the kappa-omega shear-stress transport turbulence model. Evaluations for both turbine and diffuser are performed using experimental data available in the literature. Numerical and theoretical results are compared for a shrouded turbine equipped with a 83% efficiency diffuser. The relative difference observed for the maximum power coefficient between the proposed model and an actuator disk model with diffuser is about 5.3%. For the hydro turbine with flanged conical diffuser, the mass flow rate is about 20% higher than for a bare turbine, while for the turbine with flanged lens diffuser the increase is only 2.4%. Also, for the flanged conical diffuser the power is increased by 53%. Furthermore, it is observed that the proposed blade element momentum with diffuser achieved good agreement with the numerical model, providing improved results compared to other models available in the literature.

AB This study proposes a novel algorithm for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in solar-power-generating systems, and compares it with the conventional methods of hill climbing (HC). These conventional algorithms are prone to divergence under low irradiance levels (< 150 W/m(2)), resulting in maximum power point tracking difficulties and a limited effective maximum power point tracking range; the hill climbing algorithm in particular often entraps the actuating point near an inescapable local minimum and causes divergence. The proposed algorithm uses the angle between the sun and the horizon to develop a novel maximum power point tracking technique that extends the maximum power point tracking range to 100 W/m(2), effectively mitigating the divergence problems of the hill climbing algorithms when the irradiance level is low (< 150 W/m(2)). The performance of the proposed algorithm was compared with that of the hill climbing algorithm at varying irradiance levels, and the experimental results confirm the superiority of the proposed algorithm.

AB The supercritical CO2 (S-CO2) power cycles have been receiving an increasing amount of attention due to their advantages, which include high efficiency, compactness, environmentally friendliness, etc. The radial-inflow turbine (RIT) is a key component of small-scale S-CO2 cycles, and its efficiency has a significant impact on the cycle efficiency. In this paper, an optimization design approach is proposed to quickly acquire a preliminary optimal MT configuration when S-CO2 is applied as working fluid. The approach combines a one-dimensional (1D) design method and an optimization algorithm. Firstly, based on the 1D thermodynamic model, two programs have been developed for the S-CO2 RITs preliminary design and off-design performance predictions. Secondly, an optimum set of loss correlations has been found and validated to accurately predict various losses of the S-CO2 RITs. Finally, the optimization is carried out to maximize the total-static efficiency of the S-CO2 RITs. The results show that the predicted performance using the loss correlations set found in this paper agree well with both the experimental and the CFD simulation results. In addition, an S-CO2 MT design using the proposed optimization design approach has a superior performance under design and off-design conditions.

AB The wide use of smart meters enables collection of a large amount of fine-granular time series, which can be used to improve the understanding of consumption behavior and used for consumption optimization. This paper presents a clustering-based knowledge discovery in databases method to analyze residential heating consumption data and evaluate information included in national building databases. The proposed method uses the K-means algorithm to segment consumption groups based on consumption intensity and representative patterns and ranks the groups according to daily consumption. This paper also examines the correlation between energy intensity and the characteristics of buildings and occupants, load profiles of households, consumption behavior changes over time, and consumption variability. The results show that the majority of the customers can be represented by fairly constant load profiles. Calendar context has an impact not only on the patterns but also on the consumption intensity and user behaviors. The variability studies show that consumption patterns are serially correlated, the customers with high energy consumption have lower variability, and the consumption is more stable over time. These findings will be valuable for district heating utilities and energy planners to optimize their operations, design demand-side management strategies, and develop targeting energy-efficiency programs or policies.

The system was initially operated in the two-stage mode, with the fermentor fed exclusively with EoL-DPs which, after acidification, were co-digested with AgW in the methanogenic bioreactor. In the second operating scenario, the raw EoL-DPs and AgW were directly fed and co digested in the digester. Both systems were operated at Hydraulic Retention Time of 37 days with the EoL-DPs mixture accounting for 20% (w/w) of the total feeding stream. At the two-stage mode, the digester exhibited 50% higher methane productivity (0.51 +/- 0.27 L/L-R/d) and 90% higher methane yield (448.3 +/- 212.9 L CH4/kg VSadd) compared to the single-stage. The production of 1.84 m(3) Ha/m(3) EoL-DPs added in the fermentor increases the overall energetic efficiency of the process.

AB Transient process, an essential condition for the operation of the hydro-turbine governing system, is critical for the safety and stability of a hydropower station. This research focuses on the transient modeling and dynamic analysis of the hydro-turbine governing system in the start-up process. A novel approach is developed to establish the dynamic model of the hydro-turbine governing system in transient process. The flow equation and torque equation were improved to reflect the dramatic changes of system parameters during the start-up process. As a pioneering work, the effect of guide vane opening law on the dynamic characteristics of the hydro-turbine governing system in the start-up process was investigated by numerical simulations. The results of this research can promote the development of transient modeling and performance improvement of hydro-turbine governing systems in transient process.

   OBJECTIVES; DESIGN
AB Background: Little is known on the prevalence and characteristics of asthma in middle-aged and older adults, since previous studies mainly focused on children and young adults. Therefore, the aim was to investigate the prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma and its comorbidities, in a population-based cohort of adults 45 years of age and over.
   Methods: We identified participants with physician-diagnosed asthma in the Rotterdam Study; a prospective population-based cohort in the Netherlands. Pulmonary function measurements and comorbidities of the asthma cases were assessed at baseline and compared to those of the general population.
   Results: Out of 14,621 participants (mean age 65.5 years; 59% women), 524 subjects (31.5%males) had physician-diagnosed asthma at study entry, implicating an asthma prevalence of 3.6% [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 3.3%-3.9%] (2.8% in males and 4.2% in females). Asthmatic subjects had a significantly higher prevalence of obesity and depressive symptoms (Odds Ratio [OR]: 2,02 [95% CI 1,66-2,47] and [OR]: 2,01 [95% CI 1,52-2,66] respectively). Longer duration of asthma and current smoking were associated with lower lung function in asthmatic subjects.
   Conclusion: Four percent of middle-aged and older adults have physician-diagnosed asthma. These adult asthmatics suffer more frequently from obesity and depression than subjects without obstructive lung disease.

TI Clinical characteristics of patients with pulmonary infarction - A
   retrospective review
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Review
DE Pulmonary embolism; Pulmonary infarction
ID EMBOLISM; STATES
AB Background: Pulmonary infarction is an infrequent complication of pulmonary embolism. Traditionally, it has been regarded as a sign of worse outcome because ischemia can only occur by the simultaneous failure of all oxygenation sources to the area of infarct, but supporting evidence is limited.
   Methods: We identified 74 cases of pulmonary infarction over 5 years at a single academic center via review of radiographic reports. Contrast-enhanced chest CT scans were examined to confirm evidence of pulmonary infarction, and patient clinical characteristics and imaging results were studied.
   Results: Survival to discharge was high (97%). Patients most commonly presented with dyspnea (69%), chest pain (46%), and swelling or pain in the lower extremities (31%), while underlying risk factors included history of malignancy (41%) and surgery within 30 days (24%). Many patients had concurrent cardiovascular (59%) and pulmonary disease (22%). Infarction disproportionately affected the lower lobes.
   Conclusions: Survival after diagnosis of pulmonary infarction is comparable to uncomplicated pulmonary embolism, suggesting that outcome is not worse. While emboli occurred in multiple lobar sites, pulmonary infarction occurred most commonly in the lower lobes, suggesting unique underlying physiological mechanisms in pulmonary infarction development.

AB Objective: To study the association between perceptions of various triggers of asthma and employment status.
   Methods: A questionnaire was administered to all those adults living in the city of Tampere, Finland, who were entitled to special reimbursement for asthma medication by the Social Insurance Institution (n = 2613). The response rate was 79%. The study population (n = 1657) consisted of individuals who worked full-time (n = 967), were unemployed (n = 197), had all-cause work disability (n = 334), or were retired due to old age (n = 159). Given a list of potential asthma triggers, the respondents were asked how often (never/sometimes/often) the trigger caused or worsened their asthma symptoms during leisure time.
   Results: After adjusting for background variables (age, sex, smoking, and professional status), frequency of asthma symptoms, and the use of asthma medication during the last year, any individual trigger identified as asthma-relevant was associated with having work disability (vs. working full-time). The highest odds ratio (OR) was found for vehicle exhaust (OR 5.0, CI 2.2-11.4). We found similar but less consistent associations between asthma trigger perceptions and unemployment. No elevated ORs were found regarding asthma trigger perceptions for old-age retirement.
   Conclusions: Perceptions of asthma triggers are associated with all-cause work disability. Our findings suggest that asthmatics have excess trigger perceptions that are not explained by asthma alone. Asthmatics need to be informed that inaccurate trigger perceptions may develop, and how they are induced, because unnecessary trigger avoidance may interfere with work life.

AB Background: Criteria of obstruction that establish a diagnosis of COPD have been debated in recent years. We carried out a follow-up study to assess the impact of the new LLN reference equation for Chinese on detecting COPD compared with the traditional 0.7fixed criteria.
   Methods: We examined the prevalence and characteristics of airflow limitation for a non-child population using post-bronchodilator airflow with both age-dependent predicted lower limit of the normal value and fixed-ratio spirometric criterion. Questionnaires and spirometry were completed for all eligible subjects during the baseline examination. Participants with inconsistent diagnosis according to the two criteria, normal participants (controls) and COPD patients in stages I or II, were invited to take a cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) examination and follow up for 2-4 years.
   Results: A total of 5448 (mean age 50.51 +/- 13.2 yr) study subjects with acceptable spirometry and complete questionnaire data were included in our final analyses. COPD detection based on LLN was consistent with the GOLD 0.7 fixed-ratio in general, as 51 subjects (0.9%) were underdiagnosed, and 61 subjects (1.1%) were overdiagnosed when using LLN as the reference diagnostic criterion. The underdiagnosed subjects were younger, had more symptoms, more exposure to biofuels and worse FEV1 than the normal group; they also demonstrated a damaged cardiopulmonary reserve capacity and significant FEV1 decline. Except for being older, the overdiagnosed subjects differed little from the normal group.
   Conclusions: Individual-dependent LLN appears to better reveal impacts on detecting airflow limitation. Participants underdiagnosed by GOLD criterion should be paid more attention.

AB Objective: To investigate the relationship between Vitamin D and exacerbation in COPD patients.
   Methods: The PubMed database was searched for articles published from 2012 onwards using search terms related to Vitamin D and exacerbation in COPD patients. Meta-analysis, clinical trials, observational studies, and human studies were included. Non-English articles or articles with full text unavailable were excluded; a total of 15 articles were selected.
   Results: The association between exacerbation frequency and Vitamin D levels in observational studies remains controversial, however, meta-analysis revealed a negative association between serum Vitamin D and exacerbation. Also, two clinical trials showed that Vitamin D3 supplementation in COPD patients reduced the risk of moderate and severe exacerbation. Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) polymorphisms seem to affect patient exacerbation susceptibility.
   Conclusions: Few studies in literature have data related to diet, 25-hydroxyVitamin D [25(OH)D] and polymorphism in COPD exacerbation. One clinical trial indicates Vitamin D supplementation plays a role in COPD patients with hypovitaminosis D in preventing exacerbations. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of Vitamin D in this population and to establish the best marker for Vitamin D, which patient subgroups will benefit, and the best supplement dosage without leading to toxicity.

   Methods: Subjects were randomized to receive five of seven treatments (GP MDI 28.8, 14.4, 7.2, 3.6, and 1.9 mu g, placebo MDI, and SAL DPI 50 mu g), each for a 14-day period. The primary endpoint was peak change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) on Day 15. Secondary endpoints included additional lung function parameters and symptoms (Asthma Control Questionnaire-5). Safety was monitored throughout.
   Results: Of 248 subjects randomized, 211 completed the study. All doses of GP MDI resulted in significant improvements in the primary endpoint compared with placebo MDI in a dose-ordered fashion (range 85-155 mL, p < .0001), without appreciable differences between the two highest doses of GP MDI (28.8 and 14.4 mu g) and SAL DPI 50 mu g. Improvements in secondary lung function endpoints and symptoms were generally dose-ordered, with GP MDI 28.8 mu g showing the greatest improvements. Similar results were observed when endpoints were analyzed based on subjects' background use of inhaled corticosteroids (yes/no). All GP MDI doses were well tolerated with no evidence of a dose-related effect on adverse events.
   Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that GP MDI could offer an important treatment option for maintenance therapy of asthma, and warrants further investigation in Phase III clinical trials.

   SMOKING; RISK-FACTORS; SCHOOL-AGE; ASTHMA; CHILDREN; EXPOSURE; DISEASE
AB Rationale: Little is known about how perinatal and childhood factors influence lung function change between childhood and adolescence.
   Objectives: To investigate possible early life predictors of change in FEV1 between age 8 and 16 years. In addition, to investigate possible predictors of having persistently low lung function (FEV1 < 25th percentiles both at age 8 and 16) up to adolescence.
   Methods: The BAMSE birth cohort study collected data throughout childhood on environmental factors, individual characteristics, and spirometric measures at 8 and 16 years (n = 1425). Associations between early life predictors (n = 31) and FEV1 increase between 8 and 16 years were assessed with linear regression. Predictors of having persistently low lung function were examined.
   Results: Few factors were consistently associated with altered lung function growth, although low birth weight, asthma heredity (paternal), secondhand smoke in infancy, and season of birth had a significant impact (p-value <= 0.01). The majority of subjects stayed however within the same category of lung function between ages 8 and 16 years (in total 821/1425 = 58%). Predictors associated with having persistently low lung function were gestational age, secondhand smoke (at 2 and 8 years of age), and factors related to lower respiratory tract infections in infancy.
   Conclusions: In summary, rather few exposures in childhood were identified to have a significant impact on lung function growth between childhood and adolescence. Our data support previous study findings indicating that lung function development is influenced by factors before birth and in infancy, including second hand tobacco smoke.

   DEPRESSION
AB Background: Asthma affects millions worldwide resulting in a significant disease burden. However, data on asthma burden from the Middle East is limited. This analysis describes the asthma burden in Egypt, Turkey and a Gulf cluster (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates) as part of the SNAPSHOT program.
   Methods: SNAPSHOT was an observational, cross-sectional program carried out by telephone in a random sample of the adult general population of the five above mentioned countries. Quotas were defined per country demographics. Subjects were considered to have asthma if they fulfilled the screening criteria, based on the global Asthma Insights and Reality studies. Data collected included demographics, physician consultations, and asthma control (measured by the Asthma Control Test; ACT). Quality of life was assessed using the EuroQol Five-Dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D); and limitations to daily activities using the modified Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS).
   Results: 939 subjects answered questions related to asthma burden. Overall, 367 (44.2%) reported uncontrolled asthma (ACT <= 19), and reported significantly lower EQ-5D-3L utility values (0.6 +/- 0.4) and EQ-VAS scores (60.7 +/- 24.2) compared to controlled subjects (0.8 +/- 0.3 and 75.3 +/- 19.8 respectively) (p < 0.0001). A significantly higher proportion with uncontrolled asthma also reported experiencing impact on activities of daily living compared to subjects with controlled asthma (p < 0.0001). Overall, 355 (37.8%) asthma subjects were followed by a physician. However, most visits were unscheduled (695;78.0%).
   Conclusion: Uncontrolled asthma imposes a significant burden in these Middle Eastern countries resulting in increased frequency of healthcare use, lower quality of life, and a higher impact on daily life compared to controlled asthma.

AB Background: Improved outcomes have been reported for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) receiving combination long-acing muscarinic antagonist/long-acting beta(2)-agonist (LAMA/LABA) therapy compared with LAMA monotherapy. However, little is known about the relative characteristics of these patients and their rates of escalation to triple therapy (TT, combining a LAMA, LABA, and inhaled corticosteroid). This study aimed to characterize patients initiating treatment with the LAMA tiotropium (TIO) and the fixed-dose LAMA/LABA combination therapy umeclidinium/vilanterol (UMEC/VI), and to compare rates of escalation to TT between patients receiving these therapies.
   Methods: Retrospective study of patients with COPD enrolled in a US health insurance plan during 2013-2015 and newly initiated on TIO or UMEC/VI. Patients were >= 40 years of age at index (date of therapy initiation) with continuous enrollment for 12 months pre-index and >= 30 days post-index. LAMA users were propensity score matched 1:1 to LAMA/LABA users, with TT initiation rates reported by cohort using pharmacy claims.
   Results: 35,357 patients initiating on TIO and 2407 patients initiating on UMEC/VI were identified. After propensity score matching, the rate of TT initiation was significantly higher in new TIO users (n = 1320) than in new UMEC/VI users (n = 1320) (0.92 vs 0.49 per 100 months of exposure, respectively; p < 0.001). Relative to the UMEC/VI cohort, the TIO cohort had an 87% higher risk of TT initiation (hazard ratio: 1.87; 95% confidence interval: 1.4-2.5; p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: Patients receiving UMEC/VI progressed to TT more slowly, and were at lower risk of progressing to TT, than patients receiving TIO.

DT Article
DE Sarcoidosis associated pulmonary hypertension; Epidemiology; Sarcoidosis
ID LUNG TRANSPLANTATION; INSTRUMENT; EXPERIENCE; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS
AB Background: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in sarcoidosis. We established a multi-national registry of sarcoidosis associated PH (SAPH) patients.
   Methods: Sarcoidosis patients with PH confirmed by right heart catheterization (RHC) were studied. Patients with pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) of 15 mmHg or less and a mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) >= 25 Hg were subsequently analyzed. Data collected included hemodynamics, forced vital capacity (FVC), diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), chest x-ray, and 6-min walk distance (6MWD).
   Results: A total of 176 patients were analyzed. This included 84 (48%) cases identified within a year of entry into the registry and 94 (53%) with moderate to severe PH. There was a significant correlation between DLCO percent predicted (% pred) and mPAP (Rho = -0.228, p = 0.0068) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) (Rho = -0.362, p < 0.0001). PVR was significantly higher in stage 4 disease than in stage 0 or 1 disease (p < 0.05 for both comparisons). About two-thirds of the SAPH patients came from the United States (US). There was a significant difference in the rate of treatment between US (67.5%) versus non-US (86%) (Chi Square 11.26, p = 0.0008) sites.
   Conclusions: The clinical features of SAPH were similar across multiple centers in the US, Europe, and the Middle East. The severity of SAPH was related to reduced DLCO. There were treatment differences between the US and non-US centers.

   Exercise testing; Pulmonary function testing
ID REFERENCE VALUES; RISK-FACTORS; STANDARDIZATION; EXERCISE; DISEASE;
   ADOLESCENTS; SPIROMETRY; GUIDELINES; DECLINE; CARE
AB Background: Peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) is associated with morbidity and mortality in health and disease, and provides important information of global physical health not achieved from standard pulmonary function tests. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) are genetically determined diseases involving different basic defects, but both showing impaired mucociliary clearance leading to chronic infections and pulmonary destruction early in life. PCD is generally considered a milder disease than CF and it is hypothesized that children with CF would have consistently lower VO2peak and pulmonary function than children with PCD.
   Methods: We performed a prospective, observational single-center, clinical cohort study of VO2peak and pulmonary function in age and gender matched schoolchildren, at two occasions 12 months apart.
   Results: VO2peak was persistently (at baseline and after 12 months) and significantly reduced in the 22 patients with PCD (z-score = -0.89 and -1.0) and 24 with CF (z-score = -0.94 and -1.1), included in the study. Abnormal VO2peak was detected in a larger proportion of children with PCD (approximate to 30%) than CF (approximate to 13%). Moreover, children with PCD exhibited persistently lower FEV1 (p < 0.0001 at first visit and p = 0.001 at second visit) while FEF25-75 and FVC differed only at baseline. Indeed, a retrospective analysis comparing lung function over the last year in our entire PCD and CF populations between 6 and 18 years of age, revealed lower values in patients with PCD (FEV1 z-score, p = 0.0004, FVC z-score p < 0.0001, FEF25-75 z-score p = 0.008).
   Conclusion: This is the first report indicating that cardiopulmonary fitness is equally and consistently reduced in both children with PCD and CF along with a consistent lower pulmonary function in PCD compared with CF. A certain reservation for possible selection bias and the small number of patients is necessary. However, increased focus on early diagnosis, evidence-based treatment regimens and close clinical monitoring in PCD are warranted.

AB Background: Adjunctive use of corticosteroids with anti-tuberculosis (TB) therapy has been reported to benefit people with tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE), while there is a paucity of data to support it as routine use. TPE can be subdivided into free-flowing type and loculated type. We evaluated the effects of adjunctive prednisolone therapy on functional sequelae, pleural thickening and pleural adhesions in patients with free-flowing TPE.
   Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study, conducted from Jan 2013 to Dec 2016 (ChiCTR-ORC-16009267). All the patients were diagnosed with TPE, and treated with standard 4-drug anti-TB chemotherapy regimen and complete drainage of the effusion. We compared the incidence of a composite of roentgenographic sequelae (pleural thickening of > 2 mm, or pleural adhesions and costophrenic angle > 90 degrees), or restrictive functional sequelae (FVC/FVC pre or TLC/TLC pre < 80%) between those who received adjunctive prednisolone therapy and those who did not.
   Results: The final cohorts consisted of 135 subjects. Of those, 56 received adjunctive prednisolone therapy and 79 did not. The incidence of a composite of roentgenographic sequelae or restrictive functional sequelae was significantly decreased in the prednisolone group as compared with the control group (51.8% vs. 75.9%; RR 2.83, 95% confidence interval, 1.27-6.31, P = 0.011). No serious side effects due to corticosteroid were noted.
   Conclusions: This study detected a significant association between adjunctive prednisolone therapy and decreased incidence of a composite of radiographic sequelae, or functional sequelae in HIV-negative, free-flowing type TPE patients treated with adjunctive prednisolone.

   ANGIITIS; INVOLVEMENT
AB Background: Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis with eosinophilia. EGPA can occur in patients with comorbid bronchial asthma (BA) and other pulmonary diseases. However, because of its rarity, there are few reports on thoracic computed tomography (CT) findings in patients with EGPA, especially in relation to comorbid BA. The aim of this study was to compare between the clinical characteristics of EGPA, the severity and duration of BA, and the findings on thoracic CT.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with EGPA who were admitted to our hospital from 2001 to 2015. All patients satisfied the criteria for EGPA according to American College of Rheumatology or Lanham's criteria. Patients without asthma (n = 2) and those in whom CT was not performed (n = 3) were excluded.
   Results: We identified 31 patients who had EGPA comorbid with BA. The median duration of BA was 6 years. CT revealed parenchymal opacification (ground-glass opacity and/or consolidation; n = 17), airway abnormalities (bronchial wall thickening and/or bronchiectasis; n = 15), pleural effusion (n = 4), interlobular septal thickening (n = 5), and mediastinal lymphadenopathy (n = 4). Importantly, the group with severe BA had a significantly higher incidence of airway abnormalities than the group with mild to moderate BA (81.8% vs 30.0%, P = 0.009). The frequency of airway abnormalities was significantly higher in patients with EGPA who had a history of asthma of 5 years or more than in their counterparts with a shorter asthma history (66.7% vs 10.0%, P = 0.006), particularly bronchial wall thickening (52.4% vs 10.0%, P = 0.046).
   Conclusions: The most common finding on thoracic CT in patients who had EGPA comorbid with BA was parenchymal opacification followed by airway abnormalities. The severity and duration of BA in these patients may affect the findings on thoracic CT.

AB Impulse oscillometry (IOS) is the most commonly used type of forced oscillation technique in clinical practice, although relatively little is known about its application in COPD. Resistance at 20 Hz (R20) is unrelated to COPD severity and does not improve with bronchodilatation or bronchoconstriction, inferring a lack of large airway involvement in COPD. Peripheral airway resistance expressed as frequency dependent heterogeneity between 5 Hz and 20 Hz (R5-R20), and peripheral airway compliance as area under the reactance curve (AX), are both closely related to COPD severity and exacerbations. Both R5-R20 and AX markedly improve in response to long acting bronchodilators, while AX appears to be more sensitive than R5-R20 in response to bronchoconstriction.
   Future studies may be directed to assess if IOS in combination with spirometry is more sensitive at predicting future exacerbations. Perhaps AX might also be useful as a screening tool in early stage disease or to monitor long term decline in COPD.

AB Background: Small airways disease (SAD) is considered pivotal in the pathology of COPD. There are numerous publications describing physiological and Computed Tomography (CT) imaging markers to detect SAD. However, there is no agreed gold standard and limited understanding of the clinical associations of these measures to disease outcomes.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review using Embase, Medline and Pubmed to explore the relationship between physiological and CT SAD measures in COPD (GOLD Stages 1-4). Furthermore, evidence linking these physiological measures with defined clinical outcomes such as health status, functional assessment and exacerbation frequency were summarised.
   Results: The search yielded 1160 abstracts of which 19 met the search criteria. Six studies examined physiological and CT measures while 13 publications identified physiological measures and clinical outcomes. Strong correlations were seen between CT and physiological measures of SAD. Varying associations between physiological measures and defined clinical outcomes were noted.
   Conclusions: Physiological and CT measures of SAD correlate and infer similar information. Physiological measures of SAD may offer valuable insight into clinical expression of the disease. A consensus on the standardisation and recommendation of tests to measure SAD is needed in order to better understand any clinical benefits of targeted drug therapy to the small airways.

   INCENTIVES; STANDARDS; REFEREES; POLICIES; MODEL
AB We elaborate a model of the incentives of scientists to perform activities of control and criticism when these activities, just like the production of novel findings, are costly, and we study the strategic interaction between these incentives. We then use the model to assess policies meant to enhance the reliability of scientific knowledge. We show that a certain fraction of low-quality science characterizes all the equilibria in the basic model. In fact, the absence of detected low-quality research can be interpreted as the lack of verification activities and thus as a potential limitation to the reliability of a field. Incentivizing incremental research and verification activities improves the expected quality of research; this effect, however, is contrasted by the incentives to free ride on performing verification if many scientists are involved, and may discourage scientists to undertake new research in the first place. Finally, softening incentives to publish does not enhance quality, although it increases the fraction of detected low-quality papers. We also advance empirical predictions and discuss the insights for firms and investors as they "scout" the scientific landscape.

   TYPOLOGY
AB Citizen users play important roles in the acceleration phase of energy transitions, during which small-scale renewable energy technologies (S-RET) become taken up more widely. From users' perspective, turning the early, and typically slow, proliferation into a more rapid and widespread diffusion requires not only the adoption of S-RET but also the adaptation, adjustment, intermediation and advocacy of S-RETs. These activities become necessary because S-RET face a variety of market, institutional, cultural and environmental conditions in different countries. New Internet-based energy communities have emerged and acted as key user-side transition intermediaries that catalyse these activities by qualifying market information, articulating demand and helping citizen users to reconfigure the standard technology to meet the specificities of different local contexts. In doing so, Internet communities foster an appreciatively critical discourse on technology. Such user intermediation is important in expanding the markets for S-RET beyond that of enthusiasts, environmentalists and other early adopters, to the early majority of adopters who demand more exposure, clearer information and less uncertainty about new technology options.

AB When seeking to improve science in emerging economies, uncertainty exists whether PhD training in an emerging economy can yield comparable results to PhD training in the developed world. Scientific achievements may vary because of excellent training at good universities, but also because excellent students select (and are selected by) good universities. This paper compares the career effects of overseas and domestic PhD training for scholars working in an emerging economy, South Africa. We differentiate between and examine both selection and training effects for PhDs from three tiers of South African and two tiers of foreign universities. South African academics with PhDs from universities in industrialised countries generally achieve greater career success than those with local PhDs, but training by universities in industrialised countries is not necessarily better than local training. Our results suggest that the perceived superiority of foreign PhD training stems from selection rather than do training effects, and pure selection effects in fact explain career outcomes better than training effects. Focusing on training rather than selection, PhDs from top South African universities produce a similar quantity and quality research output to those trained by the leading universities in the developed world. From the perspective of an emerging economy with limited resources wishing to advance science, the development of local universities should thus be stressed, although it is clear that individuals who are able to study for a PhD abroad gain personally when they return.

We highlight and discuss what these findings indicate regarding the nature and pattern of research malpractice in that discipline. Particular attention is given to exploring "no reason" retractions and the policy guidelines of publishers regarding retracted papers. We conclude that the frequent vagueness of retraction statements, and a reluctance to signal research malpractice, generally results in little damage to the reputation of caught, and known, offenders. Thus, a key deterrent to engaging in research malpractice is lacking. To reduce the incidence of research malpractice, we offer several recommendations for publishers and journal editors.

AB Innovative public procurement is increasingly considered as a form of public support for private innovation activities by both innovation scholars and policymakers. Economic historians have suggested an even more fundamental role of public procurement in setting the pace of technological change, reporting how defense related procurement has had a major impact on the emergence and diffusion of many general purpose technologies developed in the United States in the 20th century. In this paper, I suggest that procurement might represent one of the most important elements in creating the right soil to 'cultivate' a technology that may have the potential to reach high levels of pervasiveness. To test this hypothesis, I make use of patent data and patent citations. I design a quasi-experiment to compare the changes in the level of generality level over time, between a group of treated and a group of control patents. A patent is assigned to the treatment group if it receives a citation from a patent related to public procurement. Results suggest a positive and significant impact of innovative public procurement on the generality of a patent.

AB Previous literature finds that larger downstream markets fuel the innovation of new technologies by incentivizing firms to spend more on R&D. Our evidence shows that larger markets also increase the extent of licensing-based cooperation between upstream innovators and downstream commercializers. This cooperation is valuable because it pools firms' complementary capabilities. Thus, downstream market expansions could positively impact innovative outcomes even holding R&D expenditures constant. Evidence is drawn from the drug candidate licensing market, exploiting the quasi-experimental variation introduced by the enactment of the Medicare Part D program in 2003. A model for the determination of equilibrium commercialization strategies in Markets for Technology rationalizes our finding. In this framework, cooperation gains are proportional to market size but transaction costs are not. Thus, larger downstream markets foster cooperation by reducing the relative importance of the latter. To better match the empirical context, the model extends the canonical "one technology-one application" framework of related work, to the more general case of "composite technologies," which may have more than one end-user application.

AB In this paper I examine episodes in which superstar inventors relocate to a new city. In particular, in order to assess whether the beneficial effects of physical proximity to a superstar have a restricted network dimension or a wider spatial breadth (spillovers), I estimate changes in patterns of patenting activity following these events for two different groups of inventors: the superstar's close collaborators, and all the other inventors in a given urban area, for both the locality where the superstar moves to and for the one that is left behind. In the case of collaborators, I restrict the attention to patents realized independently from the superstar. The results from the event study register a large and persistent positive effect on the collaborators in the city of destination, as well as a simultaneous negative trend affecting those still residing in the previous location. In the long run, these effects translate into an increased difference between the two groups of about 0.16 patents per inventor. Conversely, no city-wide spillover effect can be attested, offering little support to place-based policies aimed at inducing a positive influx of top innovators in urban areas.

AB Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are potent toxins which induce flaccid paralysis by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junctions. They associate with non-toxic proteins (ANTPs or NAPs) to form complexes of various sizes which are resistant to acidic pH and protease degradation. BoNT trafficking from the digestive tract to the target neurons is still a matter of debate. BoNTs use different strategies to pass through the intestinal barrier including passage of BoNT complexes containing hem agglutinins (HAs) via M cells, HA-dependent perturbation of E-cadherin intercellular junctions between enterocytes and paracellular passage of BoNT complexes, and transcytosis of BoNT free of NAPs through certain intestinal epithelial cells. Then, BoNTs target neuronal cells, preferentially cholinergic neurons, in the intestinal mucosa and submucosa. The precise mode of BoNT dissemination until the final target neuro-muscular junctions is still elusive. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are causative agents of the life-threatening disease botulism. They are naturally produced by species of the bacteria Clostridium botulinum as stable and non-covalent complexes, in which the BoNT molecule is assembled with several auxiliary non-toxic proteins. Some BoNT serotypes, represented by the well-studied BoNT serotype A (BoNT/A), are produced by Clostridium strains that carry the ha gene cluster, which encodes four neurotoxin-associated proteins (NTNHA, HA17, HA33, and HA70) that play an important role to deliver and protect BoNTs in the gastrointestinal tract during oral intoxication. In contrast, BoNT/E- and BoNT/F-producing strains carry a distinct gene cluster that encodes five proteins (NTNHA, P47, OrfX1, OrfX2, and OrfX3, termed the orfX cluster). The structures and functions of these proteins remain largely unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of P47 resolved at 2.8 angstrom resolution. Surprisingly, P47 displays a structural topology that is similar to bactericidal/permeability-increasing (BPI) like proteins, which were previously identified only in eukaryotes. The similarity of a hydrophobic cleft of P47 with the phospholipid-binding groove of BPI suggests that P47 might be involved in lipid association to exert its function. Consistently, P47 associates and induces aggregation of asolectin-containing liposomes in a protein- and lipid-concentration dependent manner. These findings laid the foundation for future structural and functional studies of the potential roles of P47 and OrfX proteins in facilitating oral intoxication of BoNTs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Botulinum neurotoxins are the most potent toxins known. The double receptor binding modality represents one of the most significant properties of botulinum neurotoxins and largely accounts for their incredible potency and lethality. Despite the high affinity and the very specific binding, botulinum neurotoxins are versatile and multi-tasking toxins. Indeed they are able to act both at the somatic and at the autonomic nervous system.
   In spite of the preference for cholinergic nerve terminals botulinum neurotoxins have been shown to inhibit to some extent also the noradrenergic postganglionic sympathetic nerve terminals and the afferent nerve terminals of the sensory neurons inhibiting the release of neuropeptides and glutamate, which are responsible of nociception. Therefore, there is increasing evidence that the therapeutic effect in both motor and autonomic disorders is based on a complex mode of botulinum neurotoxin action modulating the activity of efferent as well as afferent nerve fibres.

AB Botulinum (BoNTs) and tetanus (TeNT) neurotoxins are the most toxic substances known and form the growing family of Clostridial neurotoxins (CNT), the etiologic agents of botulism and tetanus. CNT are composed of a metalloprotease light chain (L), linked via a disulfide bond to a heavy chain (H). H mediates the binding to nerve terminals and the membrane translocation of L into the cytosol, where its substrates, the three SNARE proteins, are localized. L translocation is accompanied by unfolding and, once delivered on the cytosolic side of the endosome membrane, it has to be reduced and reacquire the native fold to be active. The Thioredoxin-Thioredoxin Reductase system (Trx-TrxR) specifically reduces the interchain disulfide bond while the cytosolic chaperone protein Hsp90 mediates L refolding. Both steps are essential for CNT activity and their inhibition efficiently blocks the neurotoxicity in cultured neurons and mice. Trx and its reductase physically interact with Hsp90 and are loosely bound to the cytosolic side of synaptic vesicles, the organelle exploited by CNT to enter nerve terminals and where from L is translocated into the cytosol. Therefore, Trx, TrxR and Hsp90 orchestrate a chaperone-redox molecular machinery that enables the catalytic activity of the L inside nerve terminals. Given the fundamental role of L reduction and refolding, this machinery represents a rational target for the development of mechanism-based antitoxins. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are exceedingly potent neurological poisons that block cholinergic release in the peripheral nervous system and cause death by asphyxiation. While post-exposure prophylaxis can effectively eliminate toxin in the bloodstream, there are no clinically effective treatments to prevent or reverse disease once BoNT has entered the neuron. To address the need for post-symptomatic countermeasures, we designed and developed an in vitro assay based on whole-cell, patch-clamp electrophysiological monitoring of miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents in synaptically active murine embryonic stem cell-derived neurons. This synaptic function-based assay was used to assess the efficacy of rationally selected drugs to restore neurotransmission in neurons comprehensively intoxicated by BoNT/A. Based on clinical reports suggesting that elevated Ca2+ signaling promotes symptomatic relief from botulism, we identified seven candidate drugs that modulate presynaptic Ca2+ signaling and assessed their ability to reverse BoNT/A-induced synaptic blockade. The most effective drugs from the screen were found to phasically agonize voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) activity. Lead candidates were then applied to ex vivo studies in BoNT/A-paralyzing mouse phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm (PND) preparations. Treatment of PNDs with VGCC agonists after paralytic onset transiently potentiated nerve elicited muscle contraction and delayed progression to neuromuscular failure. Collectively, this study suggests that Ca2+-modulating drugs represent a novel symptomatic treatment for neuromuscular paralysis following BoNT/A poisoning. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are the most potent toxic proteins to mankind known but applied in low doses trigger a localized muscle paralysis that is beneficial for the therapy of several neurological disorders and aesthetic treatment. The paralytic effect is generated by the enzymatic activity of the light chain (LC) that cleaves specifically one of the SNARE proteins responsible for neurotransmitter exocytosis. The activity of the LC in a BoNT-containing therapeutic can be compromised by denaturing agents present during manufacturing and/or in the cell. Stabilization of the LC by reducing vulnerability towards denaturants would thus be advantageous for the development of BoNT-based therapeutics. In this work, we focused on increasing the stability of LC of BoNT/A1 (LC/A1) towards oxidative stress. We tackled this task by rational design of mutations at cysteine and methionine LC/A1 sites. Designed mutants showed improved oxidative stability in vitro and equipotency to wildtype toxin in vivo. Our results suggest that suitable modification of the catalytic domain can lead to more stable BoNTs without impairing their therapeutic efficacy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tetanus (TeNT) and botulinum (BoNT) neurotoxins, the causative agents of tetanus and botulism, respectively, are the most potent toxic molecules known to mankind. This extreme potency is attributed to: i) their specificity for essential components of the neurotransmitter release machinery present at vertebrate synapses, and ii) their high-affinity targeting to motor neurons by binding to polysialogangliosides and protein receptors. Comprising the clostridial neurotoxin family, TeNT and BoNTs engage distinct surface receptors and intracellular sorting pathways in neurons. BoNTs bind to the intraluminal domain of specific synaptic vesicle proteins that are exposed to the extracellular milieu upon exocytosis, and are taken up by synaptic vesicle recycling. A sizeable proportion of BoNT molecules remain at the neuromuscular junction, where their protease moiety is released into the cytoplasm, blocking synaptic transmission and causing flaccid paralysis. In contrast, TeNT undergoes binding to specific components of the basal membrane at the neuromuscular junction, is endocytosed into motor neurons and sorted to axonal signalling endosomes. Following this, TeNT is transported to the soma of motor neurons located in the spinal cord or brainstem, and then transcytosed to inhibitory interneurons, where it blocks synaptic transmission. TeNT-induced impairment of inhibitory input leads to hyperactivity of motor neurons, causing spastic paralysis, which is the hallmark of tetanus. This review examines the molecular mechanisms leading to the entry, sorting and intracellular trafficking of TeNT and BoNTs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is a widely used therapeutic in part because its mechanism of action is much wider than initially expected. Since BoNT is taken up more avidly in active presynaptic terminals, there is some selectivity for weakening muscles involved in frequent involuntary movements. BoNT blocks gamma motoneurons as well as alpha motoneurons, hence reducing afferent spindle activity which appears to have a favorable effect. Some BoNT is retrogradely transported in the motor axons, leading at least to reduction in recurrent inhibition mediated by the Renshaw cell. There are also central nervous system changes after BoNT injections and these may be due to brain plasticity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Numerous studies have established botulinum toxin (BoNT) to be safe and effective for the treatment of cervical dystonia (CD). Despite its well-documented efficacy, there has been growing awareness that a significant proportion of CD patients discontinue therapy. The reasons for discontinuation are only partly understood.
   Methods: This summary describes longitudinal studies that provided information regarding the proportions of patients discontinuing BoNT therapy, and the reasons for discontinuing therapy. The data come predominantly from un-blinded long-term follow-up studies, registry studies, and patient-based surveys.
   Results: All types of longitudinal studies provide strong evidence that BoNT is both safe and effective in the treatment of CD for many years. Overall, approximately one third of CD patients discontinue BoNT. The most common reason for discontinuing therapy is lack of benefit, often described as primary or secondary non-response. The apparent lack of response is only rarely related to true immune-mediated resistance to BoNT. Other reasons for discontinuing include side effects, inconvenience, cost, or other reasons.
   Discussion: Although BoNT is safe and effective in the treatment of the majority of patients with CD, approximately one third discontinue. The increasing awareness of a significant proportion of patients who discontinue should encourage further efforts to optimize administration of BoNT, to improve BoNT preparations to extend duration or reduce side effects, to develop add-on therapies that may mitigate swings in symptom severity, or develop entirely novel treatment approaches.

AB Oromandibular dystonia (OMD) is an isolated focal dystonia that affects the muscles of the jaw, lower face and tongue. It is a rare disorder but is associated with significant impairment in quality of life. Treatment with oral medications has not been successful. Surgical interventions, such as deep brain stimulation, may be of benefit but have not been adequately evaluated. Currently, botulinum toxin (BoNT) injections are regarded as the treatment of choice for OMD. However, the evidence supporting this is not available. Most studies are open label, observational studies, longitudinal clinical experience, case reports or retrospective analysis. From the available studies, OMD is responsive to appropriately targeted BoNT injections. Jaw closing dystonia responds the most robustly. Jaw opening dystonia is more complex to inject, but clinical experience is consistent with benefit. Lingual dystonia is the most difficult because injections into tongue muscles frequently give rise to dysphagia. More controlled studies are required to establish BoNT as an effective treatment for OMD. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is an effective, well-tolerated, and well-established option for the treatment of dystonic and spastic movement disorders. However, a single approach does not suit all patients, even within one disease indication. The degree of flexibility in treatment protocols is determined by individual product licenses, which often lag behind real-world clinical experience. A number of patient/practitioner surveys conducted recently have highlighted a desire for greater flexibility than that currently approved, both in BoNT doses and in the intervals between consecutive doses. New evidence arising from research conducted during the last few years has opened new avenues for tailoring BoNT treatment to patients' needs. Data suggest that escalating incobotulinumtoxinA doses enables treatment of a greater number of spasticity patterns than current dose limitations allow, without compromising safety or tolerability. Similarly, in patients with cervical dystonia (CD), repeated injections of incobotulinumtoxinA at intervals as early as 6 weeks after a previous treatment, based on individual patient need, were effective and well tolerated. Here, the BoNT doses and dosing intervals currently indicated in the USA and European Union are reviewed, together with the use of BoNT for the treatment of spasticity, CD, and blepharospasm. Opportunities for tailored BoNT therapy are also discussed. (C) 2018 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In 2010 onabotulinumtoxinA (OnabotA) was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic migraine (CM). Data supporting approval were derived primarily from two parallel placebo-controlled trials, the PREEMPT studies. Many clinicians and research investigators critical of those data have recommended that the dosing/injection paradigm for treating CM be "customized" to the needs of the individual patient rather than administered in a uniform fashion conforming to the methodology utilized in the PREEMPT studies.
   In this paper the authors debate the issue of whether treatment of CM with OnabotA should be standardized versus customized. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This review evaluates the existing level of evidence for efficacy of BoNTs in different pain syndromes using the recommended efficacy criteria from the Assessment and Therapeutic Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology. There is a level A evidence (effective) for BoNT therapy in post-herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, and posttraumatic neuralgia. There is a level B evidence (probably effective) for diabetic neuropathy, plantar fasciitis, piriformis syndrome, pain associated with total knee arthroplasty, male pelvic pain syndrome, chronic low back pain, male pelvic pain, and neuropathic pain secondary to traumatic spinal cord injury. BoNTs are possibly effective (Level C-one class II study) for female pelvic pain, painful knee osteoarthritis, post-operative pain in children with cerebral palsy after adductor release surgery, anterior knee pain with vastus lateralis imbalance. There is a level B evidence (one class I study) that BoNT treatment is probably ineffective in carpal tunnel syndrome. For myofascial pain syndrome, the level of evidence is U (undetermined) due to contradicting results. More high quality (Class I) studies and studies with different types of BoNTs are needed for better understanding of the role of BoNTs in pain syndromes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Botulinum toxin's (BoNT) success in treating several pain disorders has triggered interest in its application for pelvic pain disorders. This article summarizes results presented at the recent Neurotoxins Meeting in Madrid, Spain, in January 2017. It does not include BoNT use for Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome, which was the topic of a separate lecture. It includes studies documenting the beneficial effects of OnaBoNTA for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) in men using both transrectal and transurethral injection techniques. It also focuses on research using OnaBoNTA to treat levator spasms in women with chronic pelvic pain. Finally, it presents a novel approach using high density quantitative surface EMG to map out innervation zones and allow for more precise targeting of hypertonic pelvic floor muscles.

AB Botulinum toxin (BoNT) is a neurotoxin produced by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum that has become widely used for various neurologic indications. The four toxin formulations currently available for use in the United States (approved by the Food and Drug Administration) are onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox (R)), abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport (R)), incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin (R)), and rimabotulinumtoxinB (Myobloc (R)). While the FDA-approved labels indicate that potency conversions should not be done, literature supports relative dose equivalents of approximately 1:1:2-4:50-100, respectively. The aim of this paper is to review the evidence on the use of BoNT formulations available in the United States for specific neurologic disorders, including blepharospasm, cervical dystonia (CD), upper and lower extremity spasticity and chronic migraine. Data from the updated 2016 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) guidelines are presented and the level of evidence for use of the four available preparations of BoNT are discussed (Table 2 in appendix).
   For the management of blepharospasm, the recommendations are for use of onaBoNT-A and incoBoNT-A injections with level B evidence. For the management of CD, the recommendations are for use of aboBoNT-A and rimaBoNT-B with level A evidence. For the management of upper extremity spasticity, the recommendations are for use of aboBoNT-A, incoBoNT-A and onaBoNT-A with level A evidence. For the management of lower extremity spasticity, the recommendations are for use of onaBoNT-A and aboBoNT-A with level A evidence. For the management of chronic migraines, the recommendations are for use of onaBoNT-A to help improve headache-free days, with level A evidence. It is important for the clinician to understand that BoNT is for use in symptomatic control for the underlying neurologic disorder and, at present, has not shown a role in disease modification.

AB Improper signaling of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) pathway plays a critical role in many inflammatory disease states including cancer, stroke, and viral infections. Although the signaling pathways are known, how these molecular mechanisms respond to changes in the intracellular microenvironment such as pH, ionic strength, and temperature, remains elusive. Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to differentiate the structural dynamics of the NF-kappa B Inducing Kinase (NW), a protein kinase responsible for invoking the non-canonical NF-kappa B pathway, in its native and mutant form, and in the absence and presence of salt concentration in efforts to probe whether changes in the ionic environment stabilize or destabilize the NIK dimer. Analyses of structure-activity and conformational-activity relationships indicate that the protein-protein interactions are sensitive to changes in the ionic strength. Ligand binding pockets as well as regions between the oligomer interface either compress or expand, affecting both local and distal intermolecular interactions that result in stabilization or destabilization in the protein assembly.

AB Recent evidence suggests that the beam-induced motion of the sample during tilt-series acquisition is a major resolution-limiting factor in electron cryo-tomography (cryoET). It causes suboptimal tilt-series alignment and thus deterioration of the reconstruction quality. Here we present a novel approach to tilt-series alignment and tomographic reconstruction that considers the beam-induced sample motion through the tilt-series. It extends the standard fiducial-based alignment approach in cryoET by introducing quadratic polynomials to model the sample motion. The model can be used during reconstruction to yield a motion-compensated tomogram. We evaluated our method on various datasets with different sample sizes. The results demonstrate that our method could be a useful tool to improve the quality of tomograms and the resolution in cryoET.

AB The deviant Ras activation machinery is found in approximately 30% of all human cancers. SOS1 is an important protagonist of this pathway that plays a key-role in aberrant cell proliferation and differentiation. Interaction of SOS1 with 14-3-3 proteins modulates SOS1 activity in Ras-MAPK signaling. In the present study, we analyze the 14-3-3/SOS1 protein-protein interaction (PPI) by different biochemical assays and report the high resolution crystal structure of a 13-mer motif of SOS1 bound to 14-3-3 zeta. These structural and functional insights are important for the evaluation of this PPI interface for small-molecule stabilization as a new starting point for modulating the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway.

AB Microscopies based on focused electron probes allow the cell biologist to image the 3D ultrastructure of eukaryotic cells and tissues extending over large volumes, thus providing new insight into the relationship between cellular architecture and function of organelles. Here we compare two such techniques: electron tomography in conjunction with axial bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (BF-STEM), and serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM). The advantages and limitations of each technique are illustrated by their application to determining the 3D ultrastructure of human blood platelets, by considering specimen geometry, specimen preparation, beam damage and image processing methods. Many features of the complex membranes composing the platelet organelles can be determined from both approaches, although STEM tomography offers a higher similar to 3 nm isotropic pixel size, compared with similar to 5 nm for SBF-SEM in the plane of the block face and similar to 30 nm in the perpendicular direction. In this regard, we demonstrate that STEM tomography is advantageous for visualizing the platelet canalicular system, which consists of an interconnected network of narrow (similar to 50-100 nm) membranous cisternae. In contrast, SBF-SEM enables visualization of complete platelets, each of which extends similar to 2 mu m in minimum dimension, whereas BF-STEM tomography can typically only visualize approximately half of the platelet volume due to a rapid non-linear loss of signal in specimens of thickness greater than similar to 1.5 mu m. We also show that the limitations of each approach can be ameliorated by combining 3D and 2D measurements using a stereological approach.

AB Thebaine 6-O-demethylase (T6ODM) from Pap aver somniferum (opium poppy), which belongs to the non-heme 2-oxoglutarate/Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases (ODD) family, is a key enzyme in the morphine biosynthesis pathway. Initially, T6ODM was characterized as an enzyme catalyzing O-demethylation of thebaine to neopinone and oripavine to morphinone. However, the substrate range of T6ODM was recently expanded to a number of various benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. Here, we present crystal structures of T6ODM in complexes with 2-oxoglutarate (T6ODM:2OG, PDB: 5O9W) and succinate (T6ODM:SIN, PDB: 5O7Y). Both metal and 2OG binding sites display similarity to other proteins from the ODD family, but T6ODM is characterized by an exceptionally large substrate binding cavity, whose volume can partially explain the promiscuity of this enzyme. Moreover, the size of the cavity allows for binding of multiple molecules at once, posing a question about the substrate-driven specificity of the enzyme.

AB Introduction: Recent studies have suggested that there is a strong relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and atrial fibrillation (AF). However, they have not identified whether treating OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) might reduce rates of recurrent AF.
   Objective: To investigate the recurrent risk of AF after catheter ablation among patients with OSA who did receive or did nor receive CPAP therapy.
   Methods: A systematic review of PubMed, Embase, Medline, Cochrane library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wan-fang databases was conducted to obtain relevant cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Study characteristics of AF patients were extracted, and their recurrent outcomes were recorded. A meta-analysis was then conducted using Review Manager software, version 5.3. In total, seven eligible cohort studies and three randomized controlled trials involving 1217 participants with AF after catheter ablation were included. These participants were divided into a CPAP group (n = 619, 50.86%) and non-CPAP group (n = 598, 49.14%).
   Results: After a mean follow-up of 16.33 +/- 10.34 months, 408 patients (33.52%) experienced recurrent AF, and the recurrence rate differed between the CPAP and non-CPAP groups (24.88% vs 42.47%; RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.51-0.70; p = 0.000). Overall, patients treated with CPAP had a lower risk of recurrent AF after catheter ablation than those who did not, and about 17.59% of cases with recurrent AF could be attributed to not receiving CPAP. Meanwhile, the results indicated that CPAP therapy decreased the left atrial diameter (LAD) (WMD -6.28; 95% CI -7.00 to -5.56; p = 0.000) and increased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (WMD 7.37; 95% CI 6.98-7.76; p = 0.000).
   Conclusion: OSA had an increased risk of recurrent AF after successful catheter ablation, and CPAP treatment for AF patients with OSA might have significantly mitigated the recurrent risks. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Pregnant women report disturbed sleep, including habitual snoring and insomnia. The co-occurrence among non-pregnant cohorts is 30%-50% with increased risk for adverse health outcomes. To date, no study has examined the comorbid status or impact in pregnant women.
   Methods: The prevalence of insomnia (INS) and habitual snoring (HS) were examined in 439 women in the third trimester (34.1 +/- 3.7 weeks). Habitual snoring (snoring >= 3 times/week) was self-reported. Insomnia was determined using the Insomnia Symptom Questionnaire (ISQ).
   Results: Four groups emerged: HS-/ISQ- (n = 161; 36.7%), HS-/ISQ+ (n = 146; 33.3%), HS+/ISQ- (n = 63; 14.4%), and HS+/ISQ+ (n = 69; 15.7%). Logistic regression models revealed both independent associations, as well as comorbid HS/INS status with excessive daytime sleepiness (aOR 3.8, 95%CI 2.3 -6.5, p < 0.001; aOR 2.2, 95%CI 1.1-4.4, p = 0.02; aOR 7.2, 95%CI 3.7-14.0, p < 0.001, respectively). Only comorbid HS/INS was associated with gestational hypertension (aOR 3.2 95%CI 1.0-10.6, p = 0.048). Insomnia alone and HS alone were associated with a baby born large for gestational age (aOR 2.9 95%CI 1.2-7.1, p = 0.019 and aOR 3.5, 95%CI 1.1-11.1, p = 0.034 respectively) but however, the comorbid state was not significantly associated with LGA. Only women with HS alone were at increased odds of having an unplanned cesarean section (aOR 2.2 95%CI 1.0-4.6, p = 0.046).
   Conclusions: Both insomnia alone and comorbid insomnia/habitual snoring were associated with adverse outcomes even after accounting for confounders. These findings are clinically relevant since adverse pregnancy outcomes may have severe consequences for both mother and baby. In order to mitigate these outcomes, identifying viable treatment(s) for women at risk should be considered a high priority. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objectives: To examine the relationship between poor sleep quality during pregnancy and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
   Methods: A total of 4066 singleton pregnant women from the Tongji Maternal and Child Health Cohort (TMCHC) without overt diabetes before pregnancy were analyzed. Sleep quality and duration during early pregnancy were self-reported by enrolled women at their first antenatal care visit before 16 weeks of gestation. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was assessed with a 75-g, 2-h oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks of gestation. Information about self-reported sleep quality and duration in mid-pregnancy were also collected at this time. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs were calculated by multivariable logistic regression models, and adjusted for potential confounders to estimate the effect of poor sleep quality and the interaction between sleep quality and duration on the development of GDM. Stratified analyses were performed according to age, parity, family history of diabetes and napping.
   Results: A total of 335 (8.2%) participants were diagnosed with GDM. Poor sleep quality was reported in 259 (6.4%) women during early pregnancy and 248 (6.1%) in mid-pregnancy. The risk of GDM was increased in women with poor sleep quality during early pregnancy (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.20-2.61). No association was found between poor sleep quality during mid-pregnancy and the risk of GDM. The risk of GDM was highest in women with poor sleep and longer nighttime sleep duration during early pregnancy (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.20-4.29) when compared with those who reported good sleep and 7.0-8.5 h of sleep duration per night. Stratified analysis found that the association between poor sleep quality in early pregnancy and the risk of GDM was stronger among women aged >= 30 years (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.35-4.09) and those with a family history of diabetes (OR 4.02, 95% CI 1.54-10.48).
   Conclusions: Poor sleep quality during early pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of GDM. Screening for and treating sleep problems in early pregnancy could potentially reduce the risk of GDM. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective/Background: Sleep abnormalities are characteristic of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS, also known as 'ME'), however it is unknown whether sleep might be a causal risk factor for CFS/ME.
   Patients/Methods: We analysed data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort. We describe sleep patterns of children aged 6 months to 11 years, who were subsequently classified as having (or not having) 'chronic disabling fatigue' (CDF, a proxy for CFS/ME) between the ages 13 and 18 years, and we investigated the associations of sleep duration at age nine years with CDF at age 13 years, as well as sleep duration at age 11 years with CDF at age 16 years.
   Results: Children who had CDF during adolescence had shorter night-time sleep duration from 6 months to 11 years of age, and there was strong evidence that difficulties in going to sleep were more common in children who subsequently developed CDF. The odds of CDF at age 13 years were 39% lower (odds ratio (OR) = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.43, 0.88) for each additional hour of night-time sleep at age nine years, and the odds of CDF at age 16 years were 51% lower (OR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.34, 0.70) for each additional hour of night-time sleep at age 11 years. Mean night-time sleep duration at age nine years was 13.9 (95% CI = 3.75, 24.0) minutes shorter among children who developed CDF at age 13 years, and sleep duration at age 11 years was 18.7 (95% CI = 9.08, 28.4) minutes shorter among children who developed CDF at age 16 (compared with children who did not develop CDF at 13 and 16 years, respectively).
   Conclusions: Children who develop chronic disabling fatigue in adolescence have shorter night-time sleep duration throughout early childhood, suggesting that sleep abnormalities may have a causal role in CFS/ME or that sleep abnormalities and CFS/ME are associated with a common pathophysiological cause.

AB Background: Several studies have investigated the particular relationship between insomnia and type 2 diabetes. However, few studies have investigated the prevalence and risk factors for type 2 diabetes in insomnia sufferers. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and risk factors of type 2 diabetes in a large sample of insomnia sufferers.
   Methods: Data from 1311 insomnia sufferers recruited from the research database of the Erasme Hospital sleep laboratory were analyzed. Only individuals with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes according to the diagnostic criteria of the American Diabetes Association at admission were included in the diabetes group. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine clinical and demographic risk factors of type 2 diabetes in insomnia sufferers.
   Results: The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in insomnia sufferers is 21.13%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that significant risk factors of type 2 diabetes in insomnia sufferers were as follows: being male, Z-drugs use, high blood pressure, hypertriglyceridemia, alcohol consumption of >= 4 units/day, BMI >= 25 & <30 kg/m(2), BMI >= 30 kg/m(2), age >= 50 years, C-reactive protein >= 4.5 mg/L, a sleep duration of <6.5 h, apnea-hypopnea index >= 15/hour, periodic limb movements index >= 26/hour, and severe complaints of early morning awakening.
   Conclusion: Type 2 diabetes is a common pathology in insomnia sufferers. In this subpopulation, most of the risk factors for type 2 diabetes are reversible, which justifies better prevention and management of this pathology in order to avoid its negative consequences.

AB Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) is a common respiratory sleep disorder in children that is believed to adversely affect both quality of life and cognition. The purpose of the present systematic review was to obtain evidence of the impact of OSA on children's cognitive/behavioral abilities from primary studies published in MEDLINE/PubMed, LILACS, SciELO, ISI Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases from 2002 to 2016. Of the 649 articles found, only 34 met the eligibility criteria: studies that evaluated cognition, behavior, and/or academic achievement of children meeting clinical criteria for OSA to compare their data to those of healthy controls or normative data, provided that the samples did not present conditions that might affect cognition/behavior irrespective of OSA. The few selected articles with low risk of bias (levels of evidence I and II) showed that OSA children's intellectual abilities may be impaired but remain within the normal range. Which specific cognitive ability drives this impairment is unclear, as there was insufficient evidence of deficits in language, memory, attention, executive functions, and academic performance, due to low levels of evidence, conflicting findings, and/or heterogeneity of tasks and cognitive abilities tapped by the measures used to assess these domains. To determine why this is so, future studies must test OSA patients using measures that allow for fractionated higher-and lower-order cognitive abilities based on accepted cognitive neuropsychology models.

AB Background/Objective: Although the REV-ERB alpha is considered an important regulator of both clock function and metabolism, its relationship with sleep duration and obesity is less clear. The objective of this study was to examine the association between the REV-ERB alpha clock gene and two outcomes - sleep duration and body mass index (BMI) - in European adolescents.
   Methods: A sample of 831 adolescents (392 boys) aged 11.5-18.8 years from 10 European centers was used. The independent variables were REV-ERB alpha rs2071427 and rs2071570 SNPs, and their respective haplotypes. The outcomes were sleep duration and BMI.
   Results: In girls, no significant association were found between rs2071427 or rs2071570 and the studied outcomes (p >= 0.43). In boys, however, significant associations were found between rs2071570 and sleep duration (beta: -0.32 h/day for T minor allele carriers; p = 0.0017), and rs2071427 and BMI (beta: +0.72 kg/m(2) for A minor allele carriers; p = 0.016). In the haplotype analysis, the TA haplotype (carrying the two minor alleles) was associated with both lower sleep duration (Delta = -0.38 h/day; p = 0.05) and higher BMI (Delta = +1.41 kg/m(2); p = 0.018) in boys, when compared with the common CC haplotype.
   Conclusions: The REV-ERB alpha rs2071427 and rs2071570 were associated with both sleep duration and BMI in boys. These findings confirmed the relevance of the REV-ERB alpha gene in human obesity, primarily in males, and also suggested that it has a potential role in affecting sleep duration.

AB Study Objectives: Difficult early morning awakening is a primary symptom of delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD), however, it remains poorly investigated. Our main objective was to quantify the awakening threshold in DSWPD-patients and healthy controls as well as investigate a possible relationship with sleep stages. A secondary objective was to compare habitual sleep measured by polysomnography and actigraphy between patients and controls.
   Methods: Twenty DSWPD patients and 16 controls had two polysomnographic recordings at a sleep laboratory. Participants followed their habitual sleep-wake schedule on the first night and a forced sleep-wake schedule (00:00-07:00 h) on the second night. We used a custom-made alarm clock was for the forced-night awakening, starting at 72 dB sound intensity which increased up to 104 dB.
   Results: Mean awakening threshold in dB was higher in patients compared to controls; 75.5 vs. 72.6, p = 0.01, and the difference could not be explained statistically by sleep-time. Patients who were in REM sleep upon attempted awakening had a higher awakening threshold compared to patients who were in NREM sleep; 80.0 vs 74.7, F = 6.4, p = 0.02. Patients had increased sleep onset latency both at home with actigraphy and by PSG during the first laboratory night (20.6 vs 12.1 min, p = 0.004), however no further differences between the groups were observed regarding sleep structure.
   Conclusions: A high early-morning forced awakening threshold in DSWPD was related to REM sleep. Sleep onset problems, even with habitual bedtimes, may also be an integral feature of DSWPD. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Mental health problems and sleep disturbance are prevalent in adolescents. Intrafamily conflict has been found to be associated with mental health problems and sleep disturbance in adolescents. This study examined the hypothesis that sleep disturbance mediates the effect of intrafamily conflict on mental health problems.
   Method: Participants were 11,831 adolescent students who participated in the baseline survey of the Shandong Adolescent Behavior and Health Cohort. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire and reported demographics, behavioral and emotional problems, and sleep disturbance. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the mediating effects of sleep disturbance on the association between intrafamily conflict and mental health problems, including internalizing, externalizing, and attention problems.
   Results: The mean age of the participants was 15 years (SD = 1.46) and 50.9% were males. After controlling for family demographic factors, adolescent age and sex, intrafamily conflict had significant effects on mental health problems (standardized regression coefficient = 0.28, SE = 0.009, p < 0.001) and sleep disturbance (standardized regression coefficient = 0.15, SE = 0.010, p < 0.001). Sleep disturbance significantly mediated the association between intrafamily conflict and mental health problems (standardized indirect effect = 0.05, SE = 0.004, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Sleep disturbance had significant mediating effects on the relationship between intrafamily conflict and mental health problems in Chinese adolescents. The findings suggested that family-centered programs should include sleep disturbance intervention for preventing adolescent mental health problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Previous studies have shown that both sleep duration and insomnia have an impact on obesity and central obesity. However, studies of the joint effects of these sleep disorders are still sparse.
   Methods: The present study utilized data from the Swedish EpiHealth cohort study. Participants (45 - 78 y) were asked to fill out an internet-based questionnaire. Body mass index (BMI) and central obesity (calculated from waist circumference) were based on measured data.
   Results: A total of 18,823 participants (mean age = 60 ys) were included in this study. The reported prevalence of short (<6 h/night) and long (>9 h/night) sleep duration was 8% and 4% respectively, and insomnia symptoms was 19%. Of the study population, 16% were obese (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2)) and 40% had central obesity. There was a U-shaped association between sleep duration and obesity and central obesity, and significant associations between insomnia symptoms and obesity. When stratifying sleep duration by concurrent insomnia symptoms, there were associations (odds ratios, (95% confidence intervals)) between the combination of both short (1.48, (1.22-1.80)) and long sleep duration (1.77 (1.00 - 3.16)) with insomnia symptoms and obesity and central obesity (1.36 (1.16-1.61) and 2.44 (1.41-3.24) respectively). However, there was no significant association between insomnia symptoms and obesity or central obesity in participants with normal sleep duration. For central obesity there was an association with long sleep duration regardless of insomnia symptoms, while the association with short sleep duration was significant only if insomnia symptoms were present.
   Conclusions: Both short and long sleep duration, as well as insomnia symptoms, are associated with obesity and central obesity. There is an important joint effect of sleep duration and insomnia symptoms and there is no association between insomnia symptoms and obesity, as long as a normal sleeping time can be attained. This indicates that sleep duration rather than insomnia symptoms per se is of importance for the relationship between sleep and obesity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Actigraphy and sleep diaries have been widely used to evaluate various sleep parameters. However, their agreement in diabetes patients remains unclear. The objective of this study was to examine the agreement between sleep outcomes measured by actigraphy and sleep diaries in aging adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
   Methods: A convenience sample of 53 T2D adults (aged 50-76 years) were enrolled. Participants wore a wrist ActiGraph and filled out a daily sleep diary for eight days. Total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), sleep onset latency (SOL), and wake after sleep onset (WASO) were obtained from the actigraphy and sleep diaries. Bland-Altman plots were conducted to examine the agreement between each sleep outcome.
   Results: The differences for TST and SE assessed by actigraphy and sleep diaries were 11.3 min (SD 65.3) and 0.2% (SD 10.5). Bland-Altman plots revealed wide limits of agreement between actigraphy- and diary-measured TST (95%CI: -139.3 min, 116.7 min) and SE (95%CI: -20.9%, 20.4%). Systematic biases were present for WASO and SOL: compared to actigraphy, sleep diaries underestimated WASO and overestimated SOL. As the SOL and WASO increased, the agreement became lower.
   Conclusion: Overall, the agreement between actigraphy and sleep diaries is poor across all measures in aging adults with T2D patients. Findings from this study highlight the need for sleep researchers and clinicians to consider the method used for sleep assessment when developing interventions or interpreting study findings.

AB Study Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of bedtime fading to reduce sleep disturbances in preschool aged children by using a group parent education format.
   Design: A repeated-measures design (pretreatment, treatment, post-treatment and two year follow-up). Setting: Flinders University Child and Adolescent Sleep Clinic, Adelaide, South Australia. Participants: Participants comprised 21 children (M age = 3.0 +/- 0.80 years, range = 1.5-4.0 years; 60% girls) identified as having difficulty initiating sleep, night waking, or a combination of both, and their mothers (M age = 36.1 +/- 4.2 years).
   Interventions: Mothers attended two group sessions that included basic sleep education (sleep needs, sleep architecture, and sleep homeostasis) and bedtime fading instruction.
   Measurements and Results: Primary outcome variables were sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and bedtime tantrums, and these variables were measured using two week maternal report sleep diaries. Immediate improvements were observed over pretreatment to treatment in average SOL per night (M = 23.2 +/- 11.3 min vs. M = 13.0 +/- 7.3 min, d = 0.91), average WASO per night (M = 32.4 +/- 23.1 min vs. M = 24.0 +/- 18.3 min, d = 0.41), and number of bedtime tantrums per week (M = 1.7 +/- 3.0 vs. M = 0.4 +/- 0.7, d = 0.43). Treatment gains were maintained at two year follow-up. Mothers rated bedtime fading high in terms of usefulness and satisfaction, and they reported that could successfully reimplement the treatment when needed.
   Conclusions: Bedtime fading is a brief and promising intervention for pre-schoolers' sleep difficulties. This simple intervention can be easily implemented by parents at home with little instructions, resulting in improvements in sleep and bedtime tantrums. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective/Background: To evaluate REM sleep without atonia (RSWA) in REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) several automatic algorithms have been developed. We aimed to validate our algorithm (Mayer et al., 2008) in order to assess the following: (1). capability of the algorithm to differentiate between RBD, night terror (NT), somnambulism (SW), Restless legs syndrome (RLS), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), (2). the cut-off values for short (SMI) and long muscle activity (LMI), (3). which muscles qualify best for differential diagnosis, and (4). the comparability of RSWA and registered movements between automatic and visual analysis of videometry.
   Patients/Methods: RSWA was automatically scored according to Mayer et al., 2008 in polysomnographies of 20 RBD, 10 SW/NT, 10 RLS and 10 OSA patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of SMI and LMI. Independent samples were calculated with t-tests. Boxplots were used for group comparison. The comparison between motor events by manual scoring and automatic analysis were performed with "Visual Basic for Applications" (VBA) for every hundredth second.
   Results: Our method discriminates RBD from SW/NT, OSA and RLS with a sensitivity of 72.5% and a specificity of 86.7%. Automatic scoring identifies more movements than visual video scoring. Mentalis muscle discriminates the sleep disorders best, followed by FDS, which was only recorded in SW/NT. Cutoff values for RSWA are comparable to those found by other groups.
   Conclusion: The semi-automatic RSWA scoring method is capable to confirm RBD and to discriminate it with moderate sensitivity from other sleep disorders. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; MEXICAN-AMERICANS; APNEA; RISK; FREQUENCY
AB Objective/Background: Limited data are available on sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Our aim was to characterize the objective measures of post-ICH SDB and questionnaire-reported pre-ICH sleep characteristics, overall and by ethnicity.
   Patients/Methods: Participants with ICH who were enrolled in the population-based Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi project (2010-2016) reported their pre-ICH sleep duration and completed the Berlin Questionnaire to characterize pre-ICH risk of SDB. A subsample was screened for SDB (respiratory event index >= 10) using ApneaLink Plus portable monitoring. Ethnic differences in post-ICH SDB or questionnaire-reported pre-ICH sleep characteristics were assessed using a log binomial model or a linear regression model or a Fisher's exact test.
   Results: ICH cases (n = 298) were enrolled (median age = 68 years, 67% Mexican American). Among 62 cases with complete ApneaLink data, median time to post-ICH SDB screening was 11 days (IQR: 6, 19). Post-ICH SDB prevalence was 46.8% (95% CI: 34.4-59.2), and this rate did not differ by ethnicity (p = 1.0). Berlin Questionnaires for 109 of the 298 ICH cases (36.6% (95% CI: 31.1-42.0)) suggested a high risk for pre-ICH SDB, and the median pre-ICH sleep duration was eight hours (IQR: 6, 8). After adjusting for confounders, there was no difference in ethnicity in high risk for pre-ICH SDB or pre-ICH sleep duration.
   Conclusions: Nearly half of the patients had objective confirmation of SDB after ICH, and more than one-third had questionnaire evidence of high risk for pre-ICH SDB. Opportunities to address SDB may be common both before and after ICH. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Study objectives: To examine the relationship between pre-sleep cognitions and sleep-onset difficulties in an adolescent sample.
   Methods: Participants comprised 385 students (59% male) from grades 9 to 11, aged between 13 and 18 years (M = 15.6, SD = 1.0), from eight co-educational high schools of varied socio-economic status in metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia. The cross-sectional study used a questionnaire battery including the Sleep Anticipatory Anxiety Questionnaire -Adolescent Version (SAAQ-A), completed during school time, followed by eight days of sleep diary completion and wearing wrist actigraphy to obtain subjective and objective sleep onset latency (SOL).
   Results: Significant relationships were found between somatic arousal (SAAQ-A subscale) and objective SOL and also between sleep-related cognitions (SAAQ-A subscale) and subjective SOL and SOL overestimation (sleep misperception). No relationships were found between subjective SOL and somatic or rehearsal and planning cognitions. Objective SOL was not related to rehearsal and planning and to sleep-related cognition scores, and sleep misperception had no relationship with somatic as well as rehearsal and planning cognition scores.
   Conclusions: These findings are not only similar to those in clinical adult populations but also notably different, for example, the lack of association between negative sleep-related pre-sleep cognitions and objective sleep difficulty. The results of this study provide a basis for a more detailed causal study on the existing relationships between negative pre-sleep cognitions and subjective and objective sleep difficulties in this population.

AB During the Early Ordovician, the Tarim Basin (NW China) was mainly occupied by an extensive shallow-water carbonate platform, on which a carbonate ramp system was developed in the Bachu-Keping area of the western part of the basin. Three well-exposed typical outcrop sections of the Lower Ordovician Penglaiba Formation were investigated in order to identify the depositional facies and to clarify origins of meter-scale cycles and depositional sequences, thereby the platform evolution. Thirteen lithofacies are identified and further grouped into three depositional fades (associations): peritidal, restricted and open-marine subtidal fades. These lithofacies are vertically stacked into meter-scale, shallowing-upward peritidal and subtidal cycles. The peritidal cycles are mainly distributed in the lower and uppermost parts of the Penglaiba Formation deposited in the inner-middle ramp, and commonly start with shallow subtidal to intertidal facies followed by inter- to supratidal fades. In contrast, the subtidal cycles occur throughout the formation mostly in the middle-outer ramp and are dominated by shallow to relatively deep (i.e., intermediate) subtidal fades. The dominance of asymmetrical and incomplete cycles suggests a dominant control of Earth's orbital forcing on the cyclic deposition on the platform. On the basis of vertical facies and cycle stacking patterns, and accommodation changes illustrated by the Fischer plots from all studied sections, five third-order depositional sequences are recognized in the Penglaiba Formation. Individual sequences comprise a lower transgressive part and an upper regressive one. In shallow-water depositional environments, the transgressive packages are dominated by thicker-than-average subtidal cycles, indicating an increase in accommodation space, whereas regressive parts are mainly represented by thinner than-average peritidal and subtidal cycles, denoting a decrease in accommodation space. In contrast, in intermediate to deep subtidal environments, transgressive and regressive packages display an opposite trend in accommodation space changes. Sequence boundaries (except the basal and top boundaries of the Penglaiba Formation) are usually represented by laterally traceable, transitional boundary zones without apparent sub aerial exposure features. Good correlation of the long-term changes in accommodation space (or sea-level) inferred from vertical stacking patterns of facies and cycles suggests an overriding eustatic control on the formation of meter-scale cycles and third-order depositional sequences as well as platform evolution superimposed with local and/or regional tectonic influence during the Early Ordovician. This study would help understand the controls on the tempo-spatial facies distribution, stratal cyclicity and carbonate platform evolution in the western Tarim Basin during the Early Ordovician, facilitating prediction for favorable subsurface carbonate reservoirs and future hydrocarbon exploration and production in the Penglaiba Formation.

AB The recognition of the Indosinian Orogeny in the South China block has been controversial and difficult because of strong weathering and thick cover. High temperature (HT) and high pressure (HP) metamorphic rocks related to this orogeny were considered to be absent from this orogenic belt until the recent discovery of eclogite and granulite facies meta-igneous rocks, occurring as lenses within the meta-sedimentary rocks of the Badu Complex. However, metamorphic state of these meta-sedimentary rocks is still not clear. Besides, there have been no geochronological data of HT pelitic granulites previously reported from the Badu Complex. This paper presents petrographic characteristics and zircon geochronological results on the newly discovered kyanite garnet gneiss, pyroxene garnet gneiss and the FIT pelitic granulites (sillimanite garnet gneiss). Mineral assemblages are garnet + sillimanite + ternary feldspar + plagioclase + quartz + biotite for the HT pelitic granulite, kyanite + ternary feldspar + garnet + sillimanite + plagioclase + quartz + biotite for the kyanite garnet gneiss, and garnet + biotite + pyroxene + plagioclase + ternary feldspar + quartz for the pyroxene garnet gneiss, respectively. Decompressional coronas around garnet grains can be observed in all these pelitic rocks. Typical granulite facies mineral assemblages and reaction textures suggest that these rocks experienced HP granulite facies metamorphism and overprinted decompression along a clockwise P-T loop. Results from integrated U-Pb dating and REE analysis indicate the growth of metamorphic zircons from depleted heavy REE sources (100-50 chondrite) compared with detrital zircons derived from granitic sources (typically > 1000 chondrite). Metamorphic zircons in HP granulite exhibit no or subdued negative Eu anomalies, which perhaps indicate zircon overgrowth under eclogite facies conditions. The zircon overgrowth ages range from 250 to 235 Ma, suggesting that HP granulite (eclogite) to granulite facies metamorphism of these supracrustal rocks occurred in the Early-Middle Triassic. Based on the presence of HP granulite facies pelitic rocks, it is inferred that significant underthrusting was involved during the Indosinian Orogeny which introduced these supracrustal rocks to lower crustal levels.

AB Chemical weathering of rocks has substantial influence on the global geochemical cycle. In this paper, the geochemical profile of a well-developed basalt weathering profile ( > 15 m thick, including soil, saprolite, semi weathered rock and fresh basalt) on the Island of Hainan (South China) was presented. The soil and saprolite samples from this profile are characterized by high Al2O3 and Fe2O3 concentrations (up to 32.3% and 28.5%, respectively). The mineral assemblage is dominated by kaolinite, Fe-oxides/-hydroxides and gibbsite (or boehmite), indicating extensive desilicate and ferrallitic weathering. The acidic and organic-rich environment in the soil horizon may have promoted elemental remobilization and leaching.
   The strongest SiO2 depletion and Al2O3 enrichment at about 2.4 m deep indicate that the main kaolinite hydrolysis and gibbsite formation occurred near the soil-saprolite interface. The mild Sr reconcentration at about 3.9 m and 7.1 m deep may be attributed to secondary carbonate precipitation. Mn-oxides/-hydroxides precipitated at 6.1 m deep, accompanied by the strongest enrichment of Ba and Co. Uranium is mildly enriched in the middle part (about 7.1 m and 9.1 m deep) of the weathering profile, and the enrichment may have been caused by the decomposition of uranyl carbonates or the accumulation of zircon. Immobile element (i.e., Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, Th and Ti) distributions at different depths are mainly controlled by secondary Fe-oxides/-hydroxides, and follow the stability sequence of Nb approximate to Ta approximate to Th > Zr approximate to Hf > Ti. The limited thickness (similar to 15 cm) of the semi-weathered basalt horizon at the rock-regolith interface (15.28 m deep) suggests that plagioclase and pyroxene are readily altered to kaolinite, smectite and Fe-oxides under tropical climate. The marked enrichment of transitional metals (such as Cu, Zn, Ni, and Sc) along the rock-regolith interface may have associated mainly with increasing pH values, as well as the dissolution of primary apatite and formation of secondary phosphates. Our findings highlight the importance of secondary phosphates in the redistribution of transition metals, and in the possible Mg, Cu, and Ni isotopic fractionation under extreme weathering of basalt in tropic climate.

AB On January 21st, 2016, a Ms 6.4 earthquake hit Menyuan County, Qinghai province, China. The nearest known fault is the Leng Long Ling (LLL) fault which is located approximately 7 km north of the epicenter. This fault has mainly shown sinistral strike-slip movement since the late Quaternary Period. However, the focal mechanism indicates that it is a thrust earthquake, which is different from the well-known strike-slip feature of the LLL fault. In this study, we determined the focal mechanism and primary nodal plane through multi-step inversions in the frequency and time domain by using the broadband regional seismic waveforms recorded by the China Digital Seismic Network (CDSN). Our results show that the rupture duration was short, within 0-2 s after the earthquake, and the rupture expanded upwards along the fault plane. Based on these fault parameters, we then solve for variable slip distribution on the fault plane using the InSAR data. We applied a three-segment fault model to simulate the arc-shaped structure of the northern LLL fault, and obtained a detailed slip distribution on the fault plane. The inversion results show that the maximum slip is 0.43 m, and the average slip angle is 78.8 degrees, with a magnitude of Mw 6.0 and a focal depth of 9.38 km. With the geological structure and the inversion results taken into consideration, it can be suggested that this earthquake was caused by the arc-shaped secondary fault located at the north side of the LLL fault. The secondary fault, together with the LLL fault, forms a normal flower structure. The main LLL fault extends almost vertically into the base rock and the rocks between the two faults form a bulging fault block. Therefore, we infer that this earthquake is the manifestation of a neotectonics movement, in which the bulging fault block is lifted further up under the compresso-shear action caused by the Tibetan Plateau pushing towards the northwest direction.

AB The Qinling Complex lies in the Qinling orogenic belt of Central China and holds the key to understanding the evolution of this feature. The Qinling Complex comprises a basement complex composed of amphibolite and ecologite, overlain by a supra-crustal succession that has been metamorphosed to the upper greenschist facies at approximately 516-509 Ma. The protoliths of the meta-sedimentary rocks are graywackes, which are divided into lower, middle and upper units. Detrital zircons from nine samples of the supra-crustal succession have ages ranging from 1182 to 1158 Ma for the lower unit, 957 to 955 Ma for the middle unit and 917 to 840 Ma for the upper unit. The lower unit is intruded by a ca. 960 Ma pluton. The bulk compositions of these mew-sedimentary rocks and their detrital zircon ages clearly indicate derivation from Meso- and Neo-proterozoic granites. Thus, we suggest that the sedimentary succession was derived from an arc-related tectonic setting and that none of the detritus was sourced from the southern margin of the North China Block or from the northern and western margins of the South China Block. We conclude that the North Qinling Belt was an independent micro-continental block during the Meso- to Neo-proterozoic.

AB The Kangra Reentrant is a convex-to-the-northeast U-shaped structure in the NW Himalaya, where the Sub Himalayan fold-and-thrust belt is similar to 90 km wide. This region has not been struck by large earthquakes since the 1905 Mw 7.8 Kangra Earthquake. Out-of-sequence deformation has been reported at the millennial timescale along intracrustal thrusts within this reentrant, such as the Jawalamukhi Thrust. Up to now, the occurrence of out-of-sequence deformation along inner thrusts within the Kangra Reentrant, during the Late Quaternary, has not yet been addressed. In this study, the results of a neotectonic survey undertaken in this reentrant are presented; the studied zone is located between the Beas and the Neogad rivers, and encompasses from the Jawalamukhi Thrust to the Main Boundary Thrust. Two terraces that are deformed by branches of the Medlicott-Wadia Thrust, locally named the Palampur Thrust, are identified; this is evidenced in the field by metric-scale fault scarps. By using Be-10 dating, the ages of these terraces were constrained to ca. 7.5 and ca. 6.2 ka. This is clear evidence of the Late Quaternary out-of-sequence deformation in the innermost part of this reentrant, implying that strain is distributed along all the arc-orthogonal extent of the local fold and thrust belt over this timespan. A cumulative slip rate of ca. 1 mm/yr along the studied thrusts, which represents 10% of the bulk strain accommodated by the whole reentrant for this timespan, is calculated. In spite of the marginal appearance of this figure, this deformation rate is attributed to 7 < Mw < 8 earthquakes triggered along the brittle/ductile zone of Main Himalayan Thrust and emerging at the surface along crustal ramps, such as those represented by the Palampur Thrust in the study area. Earthquakes of this magnitude may severely impact the Kangra District, which currently hosts 1.5 million people.

AB Several stages are recognizable in landscape evolution along the Eastern Primorye coast, Kit Bay and its surrounding mountains in terms of climatic changes and related sea level fluctuations during the middle-late Holocene. The last 3.8-3.5 cal ka years were marked by a notable effect of the pyrogenic factor. The sea level rise at the maximum phase of the Holocene transgression led to the formation of lagoons at stream mouths, which underwent a complicated development. At that time, the coast's principal topographic elements came into being, and the modern landscape's pattern was laid on the coastal lowlands. The authors trace the changes in the vegetation in the process of short-term warmings and coolings. Korean pine appeared in the forests surrounding Kit Bay much earlier than in other regions of the Eastern Primorye. During the considered period, warmer phases were marked by increasing importance of broadleaf species, while at the cooler phases, a proportion of the Korean pine grew in the low mountains. In the last 2.3 cal ka, at greater elevations in the middle mountains, dark coniferous forests became more widespread, particularly spruce. At the same time, larch groves existed around the coastal sphagnum bog, probably due to seasonally frozen ground persisting for the greater part of a year. Extreme events with a considerable effect on the coastal landscape evolution include floods, whose frequency has been growing for the last 1.75 cal ka. Strong tsunamis are another factor influencing coastal evolution. Finally, changes in landscapes have been recorded related to human activities in the last few decades.

AB The Bukit Botol volcanic-hosted massive sulphide (VHMS) deposit is located in the Central Belt of Peninsular Malaysia. The deposit occurs in a package of Permian-aged coherent felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks which have a geochemical signature indicative of a volcanic arc tectonic setting. Mineralisation shows distinct ore zonation, forming a stringer to massive sulphide zone at the footwall followed by barite lenses and exhalite layers (Fe-Mn ore) at the top. Mineralogy is characterised by pyrite as the major sulphide mineral, with minor chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and rare galena; traces of gold, silver- and tin-bearing minerals also occur in the massive sulphide and barite ores. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analysis combined with the textural characteristics of pyrite provides evidence for significant variations of trace elements in different pyrite types at Bukit Botol, having three types of pyrite in the paragenetic sequence. The concentrations of As, Se, Te, Cu, Zn and Pb decrease from the early pyrite 1 to the late stage pyrite 3, and the Co/Ni ratios vary for the three pyrite types. The combined textural and compositional data of pyrite suggest that the hydrothermal fluid responsible for mineralisation evolved from an early, high temperature, reduced, low pH and desulphurized fluid to more S-rich, oxidized, high pH and cooler fluid. Available sulphur isotope data from the Bukit Botol deposit point to reduced seawater, along with a possible magmatic contribution, as the most probable sources for the ore-forming fluids.

TI Subsidence transition during the post-rift stage of the Dongpu Sag,

AB The Dongpu Sag, located in the Bohai Bay Basin, NE China, is a Cenozoic continental rift basin. The post-rift evolution of the Dongpu Sag is associated with the development of petroleum reservoirs and has implications for Neogene-Quaternary basin evolution along the eastern margin of Eurasia. To determine the nature and origin of post-rift subsidence in the Dongpu Sag, we apply backstripping, modified strain-rate inversion, and revised finite extension modelling techniques, using data from 14 real and synthetic wells that are intersected by three seismic lines. Our results reveal discrepancies by subsidence based on backstripping of well data (the observed subsidence) minus that predicted by modified strain-rate inversion and revised finite extension modelling (the predicted subsidence). During the Miocene, the observed subsidence was smaller than the predicted subsidence, leaving negative discrepancies referred to here as "insufficient subsidence" ranging from -343 to -96 m. In contrast, during the Pliocene-Quaternary the observed subsidence was greater than the predicted subsidence by +123 to +407 m, which left positive discrepancies referred to as "over-sufficient subsidence". Therefore, we infer a transition from insufficient to over-sufficient subsidence during the post-rift stage. Normal faulting that started at ca. 5.3 Ma is estimated to have produced only similar to 20% of the over-sufficient subsidence. Therefore, the remaining over-sufficient subsidence, as well as the preceding insufficient subsidence and the transition between the two, were likely controlled by lithosphere processes. We propose a new tectonic model in which variations in the conditions (e.g. rate, direction, and angle) associated with subduction of the Pacific plate resulted in a change of heat flow decreasing from a linear to a curvilinear pattern, leading to a transition from insufficient to over-sufficient subsidence.

AB The Ambug Hill in Brunei is an exceptional geological site where a series of siliciclastic rocks crops out with some layers extremely rich in marine fossils. Such fossiliferous outcrops are extremely rare in the northern part of Borneo and their description is of primary importance as their fossil content can be used to correlate the regional depositional sequences with global biostratigraphic zonations. In this work we present for the first time a detailed sedimentary profile completed with Sr-isotopes and biostratigraphic dating. The succession is divided into four sedimentary units. The first unit comprises bioturbated sandstone followed by a second unit of clay-silt rich levels whose first 9.5 m contain rich marine fossil assemblages. Calcareous nannoplankton data indicate a Late Tortonian - Early Messinian (NN11) age, which is confirmed by Sr-isotope dating derived from bivalves giving a numerical age range from 8.3 to 6.2 My. After a major emersion surface, the third sedimentary unit of sand- and siltstone lacks suitable fossils for bio- and isotope stratigraphy. The age of emersion and the related sedimentary gap can be either correlated with the Me1 (7.25 My) or the Me2 (5.73 My) sequence boundary. A fourth, thin sedimentary unit is recognized on the top of the profile with silt- and claystone beds without age diagnostic remains and calcareous fossils.

AB The Early Miocene Taskapi-Mecitli granitoid that is located in the northern section of the Eastern Anatolia Collision Zone has typical I-type, metaluminous and calk-alkaline characteristics. It also contains mafic micro-granular / magmatic enclaves (MMEs). New Ar-Ar dating results show that the age of the Taskapi-Mecitli granitoid is similar to 23 Ma and it crystallised in the Early Miocene, in contrast to its previously known Cretaceous age. Identical crystallisation ages (similar to 23 Ma), similar mineral assemblages and geochemical compositions, and indistinguishable isotopic compositions of MMEs and host rocks imply that the MMEs are most consistent with a cumulate origin formed at earlier stages of the same magmatic system that produced the Taskapi-Mecitli granitoid.
   MELTS modelling suggests that magma of the Taskapi-Mecitli granitoid was the result of fractionation under a crustal pressure of 4 kbar, with a H2O content of 1.5%. EC-AFC model calculation reveals that the Taskapi-Mecitli granitoid includes from 0.5% to 2% crustal assimilation rates. These rates indicate that crustal contamination can be negligible when compared to fractional crystallisation in the evolution of the magma beneath the Taskapi-Mecitli granitoid. The partial melting model calculations and MORB-normalised trace element concentrations of the least evolved samples of the Taskapi-Mecitli granitoid are consistent with those of mafic melts obtained from partial melting of interacting mantle- lower crust with a melting degree of 18%. The age (23 Ma) of the post- or syn-collisional Taskapi-Mecitli granitoid suggests that the collision between Arabian and Eurasian plates could be before/around similar to 23 Ma (Late Oligocene to Early Miocene).

AB The Tarim Craton is overlain by thick Neoproterozoic sedimentary successions in rift tectonic setting. This study examines the latest outcrop, seismic, and drilling core data with the objective of investigating the regional stratigraphy to deeply recognize the evolution of rifting in the craton. Cryogenian to Lower Ediacaran successions are mainly composed of elastic rocks with thicknesses of 2000-3000 m, and the Upper Ediacaran successions are composed of carbonate rocks with thicknesses of 500-800 m. The rift basins and stratigraphic zones are divided into northern and southern parts by a central paleo-uplift. The northern rift basin extends through the northern Tarim Craton in an E-W direction with two depocenters (Aksu and Kuruktag). The southern rift basin is oriented NE-SW. There are three or four phases of tillites in the northern zone, while there are two in the southern zone. Given the north-south difference of the stratigraphic framework, the northern rift basin initiated at ca. 740 Ma and the southern rift basin initiated at ca. 780 Ma. During the Cryogenian and Ediacaran, the northern and southern rift basins were separated by the central paleo-uplift, finally connecting with each other in the early Cambrian. Tectonic deformation in the Late Ediacaran led to the formation of a parallel unconformity in the rift basins and an angular unconformity in the central paleo-uplift. The Neoproterozoic rift basins continued to affect the distribution of Lower Cambrian hydrocarbon source rocks. The north-south distribution and evolution of the rift basins in the Tarim Craton have implications for reconstructions of the Rodinia supercontinent.

AB Tectonic affinities of accreted basalts provide constraints on mass transport in convergent boundaries, improving our understandings on the evolution of regional geology. In this study, nineteen accreted basalts from the southernmost tip of Taiwan Island, which is on the convergent boundary between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea Plates, were analyzed for element concentrations as well as Sr, Nd, Hf, and Pb isotope ratios to investigate their tectonic affinities. All the samples contain > 3% LOI, reflecting post-magmatic alteration. LOI and Nb variation diagrams together with comparisons to oceanic basalt compositions indicated that the concentrations of most major elements and Rb, Sr, and Ba were modified by post-magmatic processes to varying extents, while P2O5, REE and HFSE remained immobile. Although some samples show Pb loss, most samples have Pb concentrations not affected by post-magmatic processes. Isotope ratios of Pb, Nd and Hf, generally reflect the mantle source characteristics. The epsilon(Nd)-epsilon(Hf) relationship and trace element abundance ratios indicated that the LREE-depleted samples were mostly scraped off the subducting South China Sea floor, reflecting the volumetric dominance of N-MORB on ocean floors. The overriding Philippine Sea Plate contributed both N-MORB and E-MORB to the accretionary prism. The tectonic affinities of the LREE-enriched samples, however, could not be unambiguously determined for the large geochemical variability of OIB from both subducting and overlying slabs. Based on our results, it is proposed that the tectonic affinity of the basalts in an accretionary prism can indicate the subduction polarity of the associated convergent boundary, providing a constraint for regional geology evolution.

AB A detailed structural, lithological and petrological study of different transects in the Rasuwa district of central Nepal Himalaya allows the characterization of the tectonostratigraphic architecture of the area. It also facilitates constraining the P-T evolution of the different units within the Lesser (LHS) and Greater (GHS) Himalayan Sequences. Peak P-T conditions obtained for the studied metapelite samples using the pseudosection approach and the Average PT method highlight the existence of four different T/P ratio populations in different tectonometamorphic units: 80 +/- 11 degrees C/kbar (LHS), 66 +/- 7 degrees C/kbar (RTS), 73 +/- 1 degrees C/kbar (Lower-GHS) and 101 +/- 12 degrees C/kbar (Upper-GHS). Integration of structural and petrological data emphasizes the existence of three tectonometamorphic discontinuities bounding these units, characterized by top-to-the-south sense of shear: the Ramgarh Thrust, which separates the LHS (peak metamorphism at similar to 600 degrees C, 7.5 kbar) from the overlying RTS (peak metamorphism at similar to 635 degrees C, 10 kbar); the Main Central Thrust, which separates the RTS from the Lower-GHS (peak at 700-740 degrees C, 9.5-10.5 kbar with a prograde increase in both P and T in the kyanite stability field), and the Langtang Thrust, which juxtaposes the Upper-GHS (peak at 780-800 degrees C, 7.5-8.0 kbar with a nearly isobaric heating in the sillimanite stability field) onto the Lower-GHS. An increase in the intensity of deformation, with development of pervasive mylonitic fabrics and/or shear zones, is generally observed approaching the discontinuities from either side.
   Overall, data and results presented in this paper demonstrate that petrological and structural analysis combined together, are reliable methods adequate to identify tectonometamorphic discontinuities in both the LHS and GHS. Geochronological data from the literature allow the interpretation of these discontinuities as in-sequence thrusts.

AB The Sahiya and Khashabi volcano-sedimentary successions are exposed near the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula, the northernmost segment of the Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS). These Neoproterozoic successions include a series of intermediate to acidic lavas and associated pyroclastic deposits. Field observations and geochemical data reveal two distinct eruptive phases. The lavas representing each phase are intercalated with volcaniclastic greywackes and siltstones. The first eruptive phase, well exposed at Wadi Sahiya, includes basaltic andesite, andesite and dacite with minor rhyolite. The rocks of this sequence are at most weakly deformed and slightly metamorphosed. The second eruptive phase, well exposed at Wadi Khashabi, includes only undeformed and unmetamorphosed dacite and rhyolite. The two volcano-sedimentary successions were separated and dismembered during intrusion of post-collisional calc-alkaline and alkaline granites.
   Geochemical compositions of the Sahiya and Khashabi volcanic rocks confirm the field data indicating discrete phases of magmatism, however all the compositions observed might plausibly be derived from a common source and be related to one another dominantly through fractional crystallization. The low and variable Mg# values (55-33) measured in the basaltic andesites and andesites preclude their equilibration with a mantle source. Rather, even the most primitive observed lavas are already the products of significant fractional crystallization, dominated by removal of amphibole and plagioclase. Continued fractionation eventually produced dacite and rhyolite marked by significant depletion in Y and HREE. The gradual appearance of negative Nb-Ta anomalies with increasing SiO2 through both suites suggests at least some component of progressive crustal contamination.
   The medium- to high-K calc-alkaline character of the Sahiya and Khashabi volcanics could be explained either by their formation at an active continental margin or by a two-stage model that appeals to re-melting of arc material in a post-collisional setting. The Wadi Sahiya basaltic andesite and andesite samples exhibit the defining chemical characteristics of adakites: high Sr (> 700 ppm), low Y (< 16 ppm), high Sr/Y (> 20) and low Yb (< 1.8 ppm). Although this signature can be associated with slab melting, here we show that it reflects partial melting of lithospheric mantle beneath thickened continental arc crust. The early eruptive phase, exposed at Sahiya, was erupted on an active continental margin, whereas the later Khashabi succession marks the transition to a post-collisional stage.

AB The dioritic dikes distributed in the Shanyang-Zhashui area of the South Qinling region play an important role in understanding the deep magmatic processes and tectonic evolution during the orogenic process. The zircon U-Pb ages of the dioritic dikes indicate that they were emplaced at similar to 144 Ma and therefore postdate the dikes that formed in the intracontinental orogenic background after the continental collision between the North China Block (NCB) and the South China Block (SCB). The dioritic dikes have SiO2 contents of 56.86-64.93 wt%; K2O contents of 1.65-3.21 wt%; low MgO (1.50-2.66 wt%), Y (14.4-25.5 ppm) and heavy rare earth element (HREE) contents; low Mg-# values (39.9-49); high Sr contents (528-4833 ppm); and high Sr/Y ratios (32.8-189). They exhibit highly fractionated REE and flat HREE patterns, strong enrichment in large ion lithophile elements (LILEs; e.g., Rb, Ba, and U) and depletion in high field strength elements (HFSEs) (e.g., Nb), as well as positive Sr and negative Ti anomalies. Furthermore, these dioritic dikes exhibit (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) ratios ranging from 0.7048 to 0.7083, epsilon Nd(t) values ranging from -3.3 to -1.4, and epsilon Hf(t) values ranging from -4.1 to 1.6. The geochemical patterns of the dioritic dikes indicate that they possess adakitic characteristics. Moreover, the low MgO contents, Mg-# values, Ni contents, Th/Ce ratios, and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic features all indicate that these dioritic dikes were generated by the partial melting of thickened mafic lower crust. The high La/Yb and Sr/Y ratios, low Y and Yb contents, absence of significant Eu anomalies, flat HREE patterns, and low Nb/Ta ratios of these rocks suggest that the adakitic melts were derived from the melting of garnet-bearing amphibolite. The geochronologic, elemental and isotopic evidence suggests that the dioritic dikes may have formed in a locally extensional environment within an overall N-S compressional setting or during the transition from compressional to extensional environments in the Early Cretaceous. This process resulted in the upwelling of the asthenospheric or lithospheric mantle, causing partial melting of the mafic lower crust and forming the adakitic dioritic melts.

AB The Triassic stratigraphic framework for the Song Da and the Sam Nua basins, north Vietnam, suffers important discrepancies regarding both the depositional environments and ages of the main formations they contain. Using sedimentological analyses and dating (foraminifer biostratigraphy and U-Pb dating on detrital zircon), we provide an improved stratigraphic framework for both basins. A striking feature in the Song Da Basin, located on the southern margin of the South China Block, is the diachronous deposition, over a basal unconformity, of terrestrial and marine deposits. The sedimentary succession of the Song Da Basin points to a foreland setting during the late Early to the Middle Triassic, which contrasts with the commonly interpreted rift setting. On the northern margin of the Indochina Block, the Sam Nua basin recorded the activity of a proximal magmatic arc during the late Permian up to the Anisian. This arc resulted from the subduction of a southward dipping oceanic slab that separated the South China block from the Indochina block. During the Middle to the Late Triassic, the Song Da and Sam Nua basins underwent erosion that led to the formation of a major unconformity, resulting from the erosion of the Middle Triassic Indosinian mountain belt, built after an ongoing continental collision between the South China and the Indochina blocks. Later, during the Late Triassic, as syn- to post-orogenic foreland basins in a terrestrial setting, the Song Da and Sam Nua basins experienced the deposition of very coarse detrital material representing products of the mountain belt erosion.

AB We report geochronological, whole-rock geochemical, and zircon Hf isotopic data for Late Jurassic rhyolites in the central Great Xing'an Range of northeastern China, to determine their petrogenesis, source, and tectonic setting. Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) zircon U-Pb ages indicate that the rhyolites previously mapped as the lower Permian Dashizhai Formation in the Wuchagou region formed during the Late Jurassic (162-154 Ma). Geochemically, these rhyolites belong to the mid- to high-K talc-alkaline series and show peraluminous characteristics and consistent correlations between major elements and SiO2. They are characterized by enrichments in large ion lithophile elements (LILEs; e.g., Rb and K) and light rare earth elements (LREEs), and depletions in high field strength elements (HFSEs; e.g., Nb, Ta, and Ti) and heavy rare earth elements (HREEs). In situ Hf isotopic analyses of zircons from the rhyolites reveal relatively homogeneous Hf isotopic compositions, with epsilon(Hf)(t) values of + 4.84 to + 9.44, and two-stage model ages of 606-895 Ma. Based on their eruption ages, geochemical characteristics, and Hf isotopic compositions, we conclude that the magmas that formed the Late Jurassic rhyolites were produced during partial melting of a Neoproterozoic quartz-bearing amphibolite-facies mafic crust. These magmas subsequently underwent extensive fractional crystallization of plagioclase, homblende, Ti-bearing phases, monazite, and apatite. Combined with previous data, our results demonstrate that the Late Jurassic volcanic rocks in the Great Xing'an Range were formed in a post-collisional extensional setting. The gravitational collapse of the orogenically thickened crust was caused by break-off of the subducted oceanic slab and upwelling of asthenosphere after closure of the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean.

TI Cooling, exhumation, and deformation in the Hindu Kush, NW Pakistan: New

AB Asian crust in the Hindu Kush region in northern Pakistan records a protracted history of rifting, subduction and collision not commonly preserved within the Himalaya. Because of this, it is key to understanding the development of the southern Eurasian margin both prior to and after collision with India. New mica Ar-40/Ar-39 and apatite fission track geochronologic data from this region provide constraints on the kinematics of the Hindu Kush. Ar-40/Ar-39 muscovite and biotite ages from the late Cambrian Kafiristan pluton are 379.7 +/- 1.7 Ma and 47.2 +/- 0.3 Ma, respectively. The muscovite age may record cooling or partial resetting, while the biotite age is interpreted to record a thermal disruption associated with the early stages of continental collision in the Himalayan system. A 111.0 +/- 0.6 Ma muscovite age from the northern part of the Tirich Mir pluton (similar to 123 Ma old; U-Pb) is interpreted to indicate a recrystallization event similar to 12 Myrs after its intrusion. In addition, a younger muscovite age of 47.5 +/- 0.2 Ma was derived from the opposite side of the same pluton in the immediate hanging wall of the Tirich Mir fault. This Eocene age is interpreted to represent the time of recrystallization during fault (re)activation in the early stages of India-Asia continent-continent collision. Ar-40/Ar-39 biotite analysis from the Buni-Zom pluton yields an age of 61.6 +/- 1.1 Ma and is interpreted to reflect cooling at mid upper crustal levels subsequent to the pluton's emplacement in the middle Cretaceous. Finally, 17.1-21.3 Ma Ar-40/Ar-39 ages from the Garam Chasma pluton and surrounding metapelites indicate cooling immediately following crystallization of the leucogranite body in the earliest Miocene/latest Oligocene.
   The younger cooling history is resolved by fission track dating of apatite (AFT). In the vicinity of the bounding Tirich Mir fault, the Tirich Mir pluton yields an AFT age of 1.4 +/- 0.3 Ma, which is consistent with active exhumation associated with the surface uplift of the 7700 + m Tirich Mir peak. The Garam Chasms pluton has a young age of 3.5 +/- 0.2 Ma, which also records rapid rock uplift and exhumation in the area. Finally, an AFT age of 9.1 +/- 2.1 Ma was extracted from a metapelite in the footwall of an east verging thrust fault separating it from the Garam Chasms pluton to the west. The difference in ages, Pliocene vs. late Miocene, reflect differential cooling/exhumation paths across that structure.

Then, the effects of B/Si mole ratio on the glass forming ability (GFA), thermal stability and soft magnetic properties were investigated. Results showed that 3 at. % Dy addition improved the GFA of FeBSiDy alloy system, but it still exists partial crystallization. On this basis, the completely glass structure was formed in Fe84B11Si2Dy3 and Fe84B12Si1Dy3 alloys by adjusting the B/Si molar ratio. All the alloys exhibit high thermal stability, and the temperature interval between the first and the second onset crystallization temperature (Delta T-x) is up to 161-196 K. Meanwhile, the Fe84B12Si1Dy3 alloy exhibits higher saturation magnetization (M-s) of approximately 137.4 emu/g and lower coercivity (H-c) of about 5.1 A/m than those of Fe(84)B(12)Si(1)Dy(3)alloy, thereby displaying better magnetic properties in the as-quenched state. When annealed near the first crystalline onset temperature (T-x1) for different time, the two metallic-glass (MG) ribbons only precipitate a single alpha-Fe phase. Especially annealing for 10 min, the two alloys possess the optimum soft magnetic properties, including high M-s of 160.0-164.1 emu/g and low H-c of 3.8-6.1 A/m.

AB Multiple-quantum (MQ) NMR was used to characterize the organic phase distribution in a series of hybrid organic-inorganic gels namely methyltrimethoxysilane aerogel and QM resins (trimethylsiloxysilicate polymers) with different composition. The Gaussian model of distribution of MQ coherence intensities was used to determine the effective H-1 spin cluster size (N). The growth of the effective cluster size with the time of excitation of MQ NMR coherences tau indicates the uniform distribution of organic moieties in the studied gels, but the growth rate is significantly slower than that of adamantane which was used for comparison as an example of the systems with uniform distribution of H-1 spins. The growth rate was described by the exponents a in the scaling law of the form N similar to tau(alpha). The obtained values of a were 3.07 for adamantane, 1.27 for aerogel and 1.8 for QM resins. This difference was attributed to the surface distribution of the H-1 spins in the studied gels. The growth rate of spin clusters in aerogel is slower in comparison with QM resins with different content of H-1 spins which show similar growth rate among each other. This result was explained by the higher local concentration of H-1 spins on the surfaces of silica regions in QM resins.

AB The origin of the various manifestations of the mixed modifier effect in silicate glasses remains poorly understood. Here, based on molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the origin of a negative deviation from linearity in the hardness of a series of mixed alkaline earth aluminosilicate glasses. The minimum of hardness is shown to arise from a maximum propensity for shear flow deformations in mixed compositions. We demonstrate that this anomalous behavior originates from the existence of local structural instabilities in mixed compositions arising from a mismatch between the modifiers and the rest of the silicate network. Overall, we suggest that the mixed modifier effect manifests itself as a competition between the thermodynamic driving force for structural relaxation and the kinetics thereof.

AB A glass is usually formed by supercooling a liquid under ambient conditions. It can also be formed by supercooling under the influence of a static electric field, E, and used, after removing E, in the electrically polarized state as glass-electret. On the basis of the relation between E and the free energy, we formally deduce that solubility, dissolution rate and vapor pressure of a glass-electret would be higher than the corresponding values of normally formed glass. Calculations performed by using generic values show that increase in solubility would be by about 5-19%, and is likely to be more for a pharmaceutical glass. Further, we propose that solubility advantage of a pharmaceutical may be more accurately determined by measuring the vapor pressure. Electrets formed from liquid crystal and orientationally-disordered crystal state of pharmaceuticals would show similar increase in solubility and vapor pressure. The conclusions are important because of the need to increase the bioavailability of orally-, or intravenously-administered poorly soluble compounds whose molecules enable a therapeutic change in human physiology.

AB Porous nanocomposites of Au/Ag-TiO2 aerogels benefit from unique morphological characteristics of aerogels, intrinsic physical, chemical and also photocatalytic required properties of TiO2 and strong plasmonic effects of metal nanoparticles, i.e., Au and Ag. Therefore, they are able to be applied as an ideal photocatalyst overcoming the intrinsic weak points of conventional TiO2. In this research, several composites of TiO2 aerogel modified with Au, Ag and mixture of Au-Ag nanoparticles were prepared by applying two different methods of synthesis. The photocatalytic efficiency of the samples was established by using salicylic acid (SA) as a standard pollutant molecule. The photodegradation rate of SA under irradiation was investigated by the decrease in its concentration in time, and found to depend on specific surface area and type of metal nanoparticles trapped into the TiO2 network. The larger surface area and the presence of the two metal nanoparticles lead to the best results. Furthermore, the morphological characterizations and physical properties of the nanocomposites were investigated through BET results, FESEM and TEM images.

The phosphors (LuAG: Ce and CaAlSiN3: Eu) in glass was prepared by low-temperature co-sintering. The microstructure and luminescent mechanism of a mixture of phosphors (LuAG: Ce and CaAlSiN3: Eu) in glass was investigated, the results showed that phosphors (LuAG: Ce and CaAlSiN3: Eu) not only exist in the glass matrix without noticeable reaction, but also can be effectively excited by blue light. After simply varying the weight ratio of bismuthate glass to phosphors (LuAG: Ce and CaAlSiN3: Eu) as well as the ratio of LuAG: Ce to CaAlSiN3: Eu, the CIE chromaticity tuning in the fabricated LED has been achieved. It has revealed that the fabricated white LED has excellent developing potential for different lighting applications.

AB For the purpose of developing biodegradable magnesium alloys with suitable properties for biomedical applications, Mg-based metallic glasses have attracted significant attention as a new class of biodegradable metals due to their excellent corrosion resistance. In this study, Mg70Zn26Ca4 (in atomic percent) metallic glass ribbon was prepared by melt spinning and structural characteristics were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. For biocorrosion evaluations, two relaxed and crystallized ribbons were prepared from heat treatment of as-quenched ribbon. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-y1)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used for investigating cytotoxicity of ribbons with Schwann cells for their potential application in nerve regeneration. Relaxed ribbon showed better biocorrosion resistance and biocompatibility than that of crystallized ribbon. Results showed Mg-based metallic glass can be potentially promising candidates for application in nerve tissue regeneration.

AB In the literature, a previous work has validated the application of the generalized JMAK equation to model the crystal dissolution kinetics in silicate melts for T > T-liq. Because this dissolution can happen at temperatures below T-liq, the purpose of this work was to test this model for T < T-liq. To do so, the dissolution kinetics of rare earth (RE) silicate in a borosilicate melt were studied by following (with image analysis) the evolution of the crystal fraction as a function of time and temperature. The application of the model enables the mechanism limiting the dissolution to be known, i.e. the diffusion and the activation energy of the dissolution (475 kJ/mol). These conclusions are the same as those resulting from the application for T > T-liq. This shows the continuity of the dissolution around T-liq which is, in addition, confirmed by the chemical profile study performed by microprobe analysis. Moreover, it validates the application of the JMAK model for crystal dissolution whatever the temperature. Furthermore, the study of the crystal morphologies during dissolution indicates that a mechanism called crystal attack/splitting occurs for T > T-liq and leads to a change in value of the Avrami exponent.

AB An active phosphate glass system co-doped with Nd3+ and Yb3+ rare earth, optically active ions was studied using steady-state and time-resolved luminescence spectroscopies. Because this system exhibits great potential for the development of multiple pump channel Yb3+ lasers, this work attempts to identify losses in order to establish the limits of its radiative efficiency. To achieve this, multiple upconverted visible emissions related to Nd3+ ions were observed in experiments carried out under near-infrared excitation at around 800 nm. An analysis was carried out to clarify if these upconverted emissions were governed by excited-state absorption of pump radiation or energy transfer between the rare earth ions. Another potential source of losses is related to energy back-transfer from Yb3+ to Nd3+ ions. However, no evidence of this phenomenon was observed, which is a good result for laser applications. Finally, the luminescence dynamics of the Yb3+ ions were investigated in the framework of fast-diffusion processes.

AB Baseline biogeochemical surveys of natural environments is an often overlooked field of environmental studies. Too often research begins once contamination has occurred, with a knowledge gap as to how the affected area behaved prior to outside (often anthropogenic) influences. These baseline characterizations can provide insight into proposed bioremediation strategies crucial in cleaning up chemical spill sites or heavily mined regions. Hence, this study was conducted to survey the in-situ microbial activity within freshwater hydrocarbon-rich environments cutting through the McMurray formation - the geologic strata constituting the oil sands. We are the first to report in-situ functional variations among these freshwater microbial ecosystems using metatranscriptomics, providing insight into the in-situ gene expression within these naturally hydrocarbon-rich sites. Key genes involved in energy metabolism (nitrogen, sulfur and methane) and hydrocarbon degradation, including transcripts relating to the observed expression of methane oxidation are reported. This information provides better linkages between hydrocarbon impacted environments, closing knowledge gaps for optimizing not only oil sands mine reclamation but also enhancing microbial reclamation strategies in various freshwater environments. These finding can also be applied to existing contaminated environments, in need of efficient reclamation efforts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although many knowledge models describing the rejection of ionic compounds by nanofiltration membranes are available in literature, they are all used in full recycling mode. Indeed, both permeate and retentate streams are recycled in order to maintain constant concentrations in the feed solution. However, nanofiltration of real effluents is implemented either in concentration or diafiltration modes, for which the permeate stream is collected. In these conditions, concentrations progressively evolve during filtration and classical models fail to predict performances. In this paper, an improvement of the so called "Donnan Steric Pore Model", which includes both volume and concentration variations over time is proposed. This dynamic model is used here to predict the evolution of volumes and concentrations in both permeate and retentate streams during the filtration of salt solutions. This model was found to predict accurately the filtration performances with various salts whether the filtration is performed in concentration or diafiltration modes. The parameters of the usual model can be easily assessed from full batch experiments before being used in the dynamic version. Nevertheless, it is also highlighted that the variation of the membrane charge due to the evolution of feed concentration over time has to be taken into account in the model through the use of adsorption isotherms.

AB Production of taste and odour (T/O) compounds, principally geosmin, by complex cyanobacterial blooms is a major water quality issue globally. Control of these cyanobacteria imposes a significant cost on water producing and dependent industries, and requires routine monitoring and management. Classic monitoring methods, including microscopy and direct chemical analysis, lack sensitivity, are laborious, expensive or cannot reliably identify the source of geosmin production. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) based tools targeting the geosmin synthase gene (geoA) provide a novel tool for routine monitoring. However, geoA is variable at the nucleotide level and potential geosmin producers represent a broad taxonomic distribution, such that multiple PCR primers with distinct amplification protocols are needed to target all potential sources of this important T/O compound. Development of novel primers is hindered by a lack of sequence data and limited field and laboratory data on geosmin producers prevents prioritizing taxa for PCR testing. Here we performed a genetic screen of 253 bloom samples from Victoria, Australia using each existing PCR protocol targeting geoA. We detected Dolichospermum ucrainicum as the major geosmin producer (87% of sequenced samples) along with 3 unknown geoA sequence types. Using these data, we designed a novel, short amplicon, PCR protocol utilising a single standardised primer pair, capable of amplifying all geoA positive samples in our study, as well as a Nostoc punctiforme positive control. This single protocol geoA PCR can further be tested on other geosmin producers and will simplify routine monitoring of T/O producing cyanobacteria. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ciprofloxacin (CIP), a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, removal was examined for the first time, in an anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) sludge system. About 28.0% of CIP was biodegraded by SRB sludge when the influent CIP concentration was 5000 mu g/L. Some SRB genera with high tolerance to CIP (i.e. Desulfobacter), were enriched at CIP concentration of 5000 mu g/L. The changes in antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) of SRB sludge coupled with CIP biodegradation intermediates were used to understand the mechanism of CIP biodegradation for the first time. The percentage of efflux pump genes associated with ARGs increased, while the percentage of fluoroquinolone resistance genes that inhibit the DNA copy of bacteria decreased during prolonged exposure to CIP. It implies that some intracellular CIP was extruded into extracellular environment of microbial cells via efflux pump genes to reduce fluoroquinolone resistance genes accumulation caused by exposure to CIP. Additionally, the degradation products and the possible pathways of CIP biodegradation were also examined using the new method developed in this study. The results suggest that CIP was biodegraded intracellularly via desethylation reaction in piperazinyl ring and hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes. This study provides an insight into the mechanism and pathways of CIP biodegradation by SRB sludge, and opens-up a new opportunity for the treatment of CIP-containing wastewater using sulfur-mediated biological process.

AB The use of fluorescence data coupled with neural networks for improved predictability of drinking water disinfection by-products (DBPs) was investigated. Novel application of autoencoders to process high dimensional fluorescence data was related to common dimensionality reduction techniques of parallel factors analysis (PARAFAC) and principal component analysis (PCA). The proposed method was assessed based on component interpretability as well as for prediction of organic matter reactivity to formation of DBPs. Optimal prediction accuracies on a validation dataset were observed with an autoencoder-neural network approach or by utilizing the full spectrum without pre-processing. Latent representation by an autoencoder appeared to mitigate overfitting when compared to other methods. Although DBP prediction error was minimized by other pre-processing techniques, PARAFAC yielded interpretable components which resemble fluorescence expected from individual organic fluorophores. Through analysis of the network weights, fluorescence regions associated with DBP formation can be identified, representing a potential method to distinguish reactivity between fluorophore groupings. However, distinct results due to the applied dimensionality reduction approaches were observed, dictating a need for considering the role of data pre-processing in the interpretability of the results. In comparison to common organic measures currently used for DBP formation prediction, fluorescence was shown to improve prediction accuracies, with improvements to DBP prediction best realized when appropriate pre-processing and regression techniques were applied. The results of this study show promise for the potential application of neural networks to best utilize fluorescence EEM data for prediction of organic matter reactivity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cellulose from used toilet paper is a major untapped resource embedded in municipal wastewater which recovery and valorization to valuable products can be optimized. Cellulosic primary sludge (CPS) can be separated by upstream dynamic sieving and anaerobically digested to recover methane as much as 4.02 m(3)/capita.year. On the other hand, optimal acidogenic fermenting conditions of CPS allows the production of targeted short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as much as 2.92 kg COD/capita . year. Here propionate content can be more than 30% and can optimize the enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) processes or the higher valuable co-polymer of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). In this work, first a full set of batch assays were used at three different temperatures (37, 55 and 70 degrees C) and three different initial pH (8, 9 and 10) to identify the best conditions for optimizing both the total SCFAs and propionate content from CPS fermentation. Then, the optimal conditions were applied in long term to a Sequencing Batch Fermentation Reactor where the highest propionate production (100-120 mg COD/g TVSfed.d) was obtained at 37 degrees C and adjusting the feeding pH at 8. This was attributed to the higher hydrolysis efficiency of the cellulosic materials (up to 44%), which increased the selective growth of Propionibacterium acidopropionici in the fermentation broth up to 34%. At the same time, around 88% of the phosphorus released during the acidogenic fermentation was recovered as much as 0.15 kg of struvite per capita . year. Finally, the potential market value was preliminary estimated for the recovered materials that can triple over the conventional scenario of biogas recovery in existing municipal wastewater treatment plants.

AB This study investigated the removal of 15 trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) occurring at ambient concentrations from municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent by advanced oxidation using UV/H2O2 at pilot-scale. Pseudo first-order rate constants (k(obs)) for photolytic as well as combined oxidative and photolytic degradation observed at pilot-scale were validated with results from a bench-scale collimated beam device. No significant difference was determined between pilot- and lab-scale performance. During continuous pilot-scale operation at constant UV fluence of 800 mJ/cm(2) and H2O2 dosage of 10 mg/L, the removal of various TOrCs was investigated. The average observed removal for photo-susceptible (k(UV)>10(-3) cm(2)/mJ; like diclofenac, iopromide and sulfamethoxazole), moderately photo-susceptible (10(-4)<k(UV)<10(-3) cm(2)/mL; like climbazole, tramadol, sotalol, citalopram, benzotriazole, venlafaxine and metoprolol), and most photo-resistant (k(UV)<10(-4) cm(2)/mJ; like primidone, carbamazepine and gabapentin) compounds was 90%, 49% and 37% including outliers, respectively. The poorly reactive compound TCEP was not significantly eliminated during pilot-scale experiments. Additionally, based on removal kinetics of photo-resistant TOrCs, continuous pilot-scale operation revealed high variations of OH-radical exposure determined from removal kinetics of photo-resistant TOrCs, primarily due to nitrite concentration fluctuations in the feed water. Furthermore, a correlation between OH-radical exposure and scavenging capacity could be determined and verified by mechanistic modeling using UV fluence, H2O2 dosage, and standard water quality parameters (i.e., DOC, NO3-, NO2- and HCO3-) as model input data. This correlation revealed the possibility of OH-radical exposure prediction by water matrix parameters and proved its applicability for pilot-scale operations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Crude glycerol is an important by-product of the biodiesel industry, which can be converted into volatile fatty acids (VFA) and/or 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) by fermentation. In this study, a selective conversion of VFA to polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) was attained while leaving 1,3-PDO in the supernatant by means of mixed microbial consortia selection strategies. The process showed highly reproducible results in terms of PHA yield, 0.99 +/- 0.07 C-mol PHA/C-mol S (0.84 g COD PHA/g COD S), PHA content (76 +/- 3.1 g PHA/100 g TSS) and 1,3-PDO recovery (99 +/- 2.1%). The combined process had an ultimate yield from crude glycerol of 0.19 g COD PHA and 0.42 g COD 1,3-PDO per g of input COD. The novel enrichment strategy applied for selectively transforming fermentation by-products into a high value product (PHA) demonstrates the significance of the enrichment process for targeting specific bio-transformations and could potentially prove valuable for other biotechnological applications as well.

AB An analytical method based on high resolution mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography (LC-HRMS) for 25 quaternary phosphonium compounds (QPCs) and derived phosphine oxides (POs) was developed and validated. To investigate the occurrence and fate of QPCs in the aquatic environment, water, suspended solids and sediments from the rivers Rhine and Elbe (upper and middle Elbe as well as tidal Elbe) were analyzed, as well as samples from tributaries bearing significant loads of QPCs. For the first time, the quaternary phosphonium compound tetrabutylphosphonium (Bu4P+) was detected. In the river Elbe concentrations were determined of up to 4700 ng/L (surface water) and 1000 mu g/kg (sediment), respectively. Analysis of a time series of suspended solids (2005-2015) showed that QPCs have been present in the Elbe and Rhine catchment for at least one decade, with partly rising tendency. A degradation experiment with Rhine sediment revealed that triphenylphosphonium compounds (R-Ph3P+) and Bu4P+ are persistent in contact with sediment and suspended solids and tend to sorb onto sediment particles. Toxicological studies (reactive oxygen species (ROS) after substance exposure, Ames test, Micronucleus test, determination of cytotoxicity) with selected QPCs confirmed that all of them exhibit cytotoxicity and some even genotoxic potential at elevated concentrations, which emphasizes the need for an emission regulation of these compounds.

ID HYDRODYNAMICS
AB A new Lagrangian particle method for solving Euler equations for compressible inviscid fluid or gas flows is proposed. Similar to smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), the method represents fluid cells with Lagrangian particles and is suitable for the simulation of complex free surface/multiphase flows. The main contributions of our method, which is different from SPH in all other aspects, are (a) significant improvement of approximation of differential operators based on a polynomial fit via weighted least squares approximation and the convergence of prescribed order, (b) a second-order particle-based algorithm that reduces to the first-order upwind method at local extremal points, providing accuracy and long term stability, and (c) more accurate resolution of entropy discontinuities and states at free interfaces. While the method is consistent and convergent to a prescribed order, the conservation of momentum and energy is not exact and depends on the convergence order. The method is generalizable to coupled hyperbolic-elliptic systems. Numerical verification tests demonstrating the convergence order are presented as well as examples of complex multiphase flows.

AB High-order methods for conservation laws can be highly efficient if their stability is ensured. A suitable means mimicking estimates of the continuous level is provided by summation-by-parts (SBP) operators and the weak enforcement of boundary conditions. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in generalised SBP operators both in the finite difference and the discontinuous Galerkin spectral element framework. However, if generalised SBP operators are used, the treatment of the boundaries becomes more difficult since some properties of the continuous level are no longer mimicked discretely-interpolating the product of two functions will in general result in a value different from the product of the interpolations. Thus, desired properties such as conservation and stability are more difficult to obtain. Here, new formulations are proposed, allowing the creation of discretisations using general SBP operators that are both conservative and stable. Thus, several shortcomings that might be attributed to generalised SBP operators are overcome (cf. Nordstrom and Ruggiu (2017) [38] and Manzanero et al. (2017) [39]). (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB We develop a general interface procedure to couple both structured and unstructured parts of a hybrid mesh in a non-collocated, multi-block fashion. The target is to gain optimal computational efficiency in fluid dynamics simulations involving complex geometries. While guaranteeing stability, the proposed procedure is optimized for accuracy and requires minimal algorithmic modifications to already existing schemes. Initial numerical investigations confirm considerable efficiency gains compared to non-hybrid calculations of up to an order of magnitude. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper explores the impact of the definition of the bounds of the limiter proposed by Michalak and Ollivier-Gooch in [56] (2009), for higher-order Monotone-Upstream Central Scheme for Conservation Laws (MUSCL) numerical schemes on unstructured meshes in the finite-volume (FV) framework. A new modification of the limiter is proposed where the bounds are redefined by utilising all the spatial information provided by all the elements in the reconstruction stencil. Numerical results obtained on smooth and discontinuous test problems of the Euler equations on unstructured meshes, highlight that the newly proposed extended bounds limiter exhibits superior performance in terms of accuracy and mesh sensitivity compared to the cell-based or vertex-based bounds implementations.

AB In this paper, a class of new high order reconstructed DG (rDG) methods based on the compact least-squares (CLS) reconstruction [23,24] is developed for simulating the two dimensional steady-state compressible flows on hybrid grids. The proposed method combines the advantages of the DG discretization with the flexibility of the compact least-squares reconstruction, which exhibits its superior potential in enhancing the level of accuracy and reducing the computational cost compared to the underlying DG methods with respect to the same number of degrees of freedom. To be specific, a third-order compact least-squares rDG(p(1)p(2)) method and a fourth-order compact least-squares rDG(p(2)p(3)) method are developed and investigated in this work. In this compact least-squares rDG method, the low order degrees of freedom are evolved through the underlying DG(p(1)) method and DG(p(2)) method, respectively, while the high order degrees of freedom are reconstructed through the compact least-squares reconstruction, in which the constitutive relations are built by requiring the reconstructed polynomial and its spatial derivatives on the target cell to conserve the cell averages and the corresponding spatial derivatives on the face-neighboring cells. The large sparse linear system resulted by the compact least-squares reconstruction can be solved relatively efficient when it is coupled with the temporal discretization in the steady-state simulations. A number of test cases are presented to assess the performance of the high order compact least-squares rDG methods, which demonstrates their potential to be an alternative approach for the high order numerical simulations of steady-state compressible flows.

AB Developed is a high-order accurate shock-capturing scheme for the compressible Euler/Navier-Stokes equations; the formal accuracy is 5th order in space and 4th order in time. The performance and efficiency of the scheme are validated in various numerical tests. The main ingredients of the scheme are nothing special; they are variants of the standard numerical flux, MUSCL, the usual Lagrange's polynomial and the conventional Runge-Kutta method. The scheme can compute a boundary layer accurately with a rational resolution and capture a stationary contact discontinuity sharply without inner points. And yet it is endowed with high resistance against shock anomalies (carbuncle phenomenon, post-shock oscillations, etc.). A good balance between high robustness and low dissipation is achieved by blending three types of numerical fluxes according to physical situation in an intuitively easy-to-understand way. The performance of the scheme is largely comparable to that of WENO5-Rusanov, while its computational cost is 30-40% less than of that of the advanced scheme. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper we present an extension of Residual Distribution techniques for the simulation of compressible flows in non-equilibrium conditions. The latter are modeled by means of a state-of-the-art multi-species and two-temperature model.
   An entropy-based variable transformation that symmetrizes the projected advective Jacobian for such a thermophysical model is introduced. Moreover, the transformed advection Jacobian matrix presents a block diagonal structure, with mass-species and electronic-vibrational energy being completely decoupled from the momentum and total energy sub-system.
   The advantageous structure of the transformed advective Jacobian can be exploited by contour-integration-based Residual Distribution techniques: established schemes that operate on dense matrices can be substituted by the same scheme operating on the momentum-energy subsystem matrix and repeated application of scalar scheme to the mass-species and electronic-vibrational energy terms.
   Finally, the performance gain of the symmetrizing-variables formulation is quantified on a selection of representative testcases, ranging from subsonic to hypersonic, in inviscid or viscous conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we adapt a parallel time integration scheme to track the trajectories of noisy non-linear dynamical systems. Specifically, we formulate a parallel algorithm to generate the sample path of nonlinear oscillator defined by stochastic differential equations (SDEs) using the so-called parareal method for ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The presence of Wiener process in SDEs causes difficulties in the direct application of any numerical integration techniques of ODEs including the parareal algorithm. The parallel implementation of the algorithm involves two SDEs solvers, namely a fine-level scheme to integrate the system in parallel and a coarse-level scheme to generate and correct the required initial conditions to start the fine-level integrators. For the numerical illustration, a randomly excited Duffing oscillator is investigated in order to study the performance of the stochastic parallel algorithm with respect to a range of system parameters. The distributed implementation of the algorithm exploits Massage Passing Interface (MPI). (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

ID COARSE; POTENTIALS; ALGORITHMS; EFFICIENT
AB In molecular dynamics simulations, compared with popular all-atom force field approaches, coarse-grained (CG) methods are frequently used for the rapid investigations of long time-and length-scale processes in many important biological and soft matter studies. The typical task in coarse-graining is to derive interaction force functions between different CG site types in terms of their distance, bond angle or dihedral angle. In this paper, an l(1)-regularized least squares model is applied to form the force functions, which makes additional use of the B-spline wavelet frame transform in order to preserve the important features of force functions. The B-spline tight frames system has a simple explicit expression which is useful for representing our force functions. Moreover, the redundancy of the system offers more resilience to the effects of noise and is useful in the case of lossy data. Numerical results for molecular systems involving pairwise non-bonded, three and four-body bonded interactions are obtained to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB This work is concerned with spatial advection and diffusion discretization technology within the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). In this context, a novel method is proposed, which is dubbed the Enhanced Taylor Advection-Diffusion (ETAD) scheme. The model equation employed for design of the scheme is the scalar advection-diffusion equation, the industrial application being incompressible laminar and turbulent flow. Developed to be implementable into finite volume codes, ETAD places specific emphasis on improving accuracy on stretched structured and unstructured meshes while considering both advection and diffusion aspects in a holistic manner. A vertex-centered structured and unstructured finite volume scheme is used, and only data available on either side of the volume face is employed. This includes the addition of a so-called mesh stretching metric. Additionally, non-linear blending with the existing NVSF scheme was performed in the interest of robustness and stability, particularly on equispaced meshes. The developed scheme is assessed in terms of accuracy - this is done analytically and numerically, via comparison to upwind methods which include the popular QUICK and CUI techniques. Numerical tests involved the 1D scalar advection-diffusion equation, a 2D lid driven cavity and turbulent flow case. Significant improvements in accuracy were achieved, with L-2 error reductions of up to 75%. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A new class of continuously-differentiable shape functions is developed and applied to two-dimensional electrostatic PIC simulation on an unstructured simplex (triangle) mesh. It is shown that troublesome aliasing instabilities are avoided for cold plasma simulation in which the Debye length is as small as 0.01 cell sizes. These new shape functions satisfy all requirements for PIC particle shape. They are non-negative, have compact support, and partition unity. They are given explicitly by cubic expressions in the usual triangle logical (areal) coordinates. The shape functions are not finite elements because their structure depends on the topology of the mesh, in particular, the number of triangles neighboring each mesh vertex. Nevertheless, they may be useful as approximations to solution of other problems in which continuity of derivatives is required or desired. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The inverse medium problem with discontinuous refractive index is a kind of challenging inverse problem. We employ the primal dual theory and fast solution of integral equations, and propose a new iterative imaging method. The selection criteria of regularization parameter is given by the method of generalized cross-validation. Based on multi-frequency measurements of the scattered field, a recursive linearization algorithm has been presented with respect to the frequency from low to high. We also discuss the initial guess selection strategy by semi-analytical approaches. Numerical experiments are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper, an adjoint-based high-order h-adaptive direct discontinuous Galerkin method is developed and analyzed for the two dimensional steady state compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Particular emphasis is devoted to the analysis of the adjoint consistency for three different direct discontinuous Galerkin discretizations: including the original direct discontinuous Galerkin method (DDG), the direct discontinuous Galerkin method with interface correction (DDG(IC)) and the symmetric direct discontinuous Galerkin method (SDDG). Theoretical analysis shows the extra interface correction term adopted in the DDG(IC) method and the SDDG method plays a key role in preserving the adjoint consistency. To be specific, for the model problem considered in this work, we prove that the original DDG method is not adjoint consistent, while the DDG(IC) method and the SDDG method can be adjoint consistent with appropriate treatment of boundary conditions and correct modifications towards the underlying output functionals. The performance of those three DDG methods is carefully investigated and evaluated through typical test cases. Based on the theoretical analysis, an adjoint-based h-adaptive DDG(IC) method is further developed and evaluated, numerical experiment shows its potential in the applications of adjoint-based adaptation for simulating compressible flows.

AB We show that the standard boundary integral operators, defined on the unit sphere, for the Stokes equations diagonalize on a specific set of vector spherical harmonics and provide formulas for their spectra. We also derive analytical expressions for evaluating the operators away from the boundary. When two particle are located close to each other, we use a truncated series expansion to compute the hydrodynamic interaction. On the other hand, we use the standard spectrally accurate quadrature scheme to evaluate smooth integrals on the far-field, and accelerate the resulting discrete sums using the fast multipole method (FMM). We employ this discretization scheme to analyze several boundary integral formulations of interest including those arising in porous media flow, active matter and magneto-hydrodynamics of rigid particles. We provide numerical results verifying the accuracy and scaling of their evaluation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB High order methods based on diagonal-norm summation by parts operators can be shown to satisfy a discrete conservation or dissipation of entropy for nonlinear systems of hyperbolic PDEs [1,2]. These methods can also be interpreted as nodal discontinuous Galerkin methods with diagonal mass matrices [3-6]. In this work, we describe how use flux differencing, quadrature-based projections, and SBP-like operators to construct discretely entropy conservative schemes for DG methods under more arbitrary choices of volume and surface quadrature rules. The resulting methods are semi-discretely entropy conservative or entropy stable with respect to the volume quadrature rule used. Numerical experiments confirm the stability and high order accuracy of the proposed methods for the compressible Euler equations in one and two dimensions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A Finite-Volume scheme for the numerical computations of compressible single-and two-phase flows in flexible pipelines is proposed based on an approximate Godunov-type approach. The spatial discretization is here obtained using the HLLC scheme. In addition, the numerical treatment of abrupt changes in area and network including several pipelines connected at junctions is also considered. The proposed approach is based on the integral form of the governing equations making it possible to tackle general equations of state. A coupled approach for the resolution of fluid-structure interaction of compressible fluid flowing in flexible pipes is considered. The structural problem is solved using Euler-Bernoulli beam finite elements. The present Finite-Volume method is applied to ideal gas and two-phase steam-water based on the Homogeneous Equilibrium Model (HEM) in conjunction with a tabulated equation of state in order to demonstrate its ability to tackle general equations of state. The extensive application of the scheme for both shock tube and other transient flow problems demonstrates its capability to resolve such problems accurately and robustly. Finally, the proposed 1-D fluid-structure interaction model appears to be computationally efficient. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Classical models of electrophysiology do not typically account for the effects of high structural heterogeneity in the spatio-temporal description of excitation waves propagation. We consider a modification of the Monodomain model obtained by replacing the diffusive term of the classical formulation with a fractional power of the operator, defined in the spectral sense. The resulting nonlocal model describes different levels of tissue heterogeneity as the fractional exponent is varied. The numerical method for the solution of the fractional Monodomain relies on an integral representation of the nonlocal operator combined with a finite element discretisation in space, allowing to handle in a natural way bounded domains in more than one spatial dimension. Numerical tests in two spatial dimensions illustrate the features of the model. Activation times, action potential duration and its dispersion throughout the domain are studied as a function of the fractional parameter: the expected peculiar behaviour driven by tissue heterogeneities is recovered.

ID EULER EQUATIONS; ORDER; CONSERVATION; FLOWS; GRIDS
AB We present a novel high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretization for the spherical shallow water equations, able to handle wetting/drying and non-conforming, curved meshes in a well-balanced manner. This requires a well-balanced discretization, that cannot rely on exact quadrature, due to the curved mesh. Using the strong form of the discontinuous Galerkin discretization, we achieve a splitting of the well-balanced condition into individual problems for the flux and volume terms, which has significant advantages: It allows for the construction of non-conforming, well-balanced flux discretizations, i.e. we can perform non-conforming mesh refinement while preserving the well-balanced property of the scheme. More importantly, this approach enables the development of a new method for handling wet/dry transitions. In contrast to other wetting/drying methods, it is well-balanced and able to handle wetting/drying robustly at any polynomial order, without the introduction of physical model assumptions such as viscosity, artificial porosity or cancellation of gravity.
   We perform a series of one-dimensional tests and analyze the properties of our scheme. In order to validate our method for the simulation of large-scale tsunami events on the rotating sphere, we perform numerical simulations of the 2011 Tohoku tsunami and compare our results to real-world buoy data. The method is able to predict arrival times and wave amplitudes accurately even over long distances. This indicates that our method accurately captures all physical phenomena relevant to the long-term evolution of tsunami waves. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Interconnected porous chitosan scaffolds coated by chemically modified graphene (such as graphene oxide, GO) film have previously been prepared. In the present study, the attachment and proliferation of L929 on the surface of the composite scaffolds were reported and their in vivo biocompatible and biodegradability were evaluated. L929 cell culture on GO-coated chitosan scaffold surface with lower GO content promoted cell viability, but at higher content (1.0 mg/mL) a slight cytotoxicity appeared. The biodegradation rate of the composite scaffolds exhibited a content dependent behavior, decreased of remaining area from pure chitosan scaffold to the composite of 1.0 mg/mL GO content. The results demonstrated the high potential applications of GO-coating in fields of tissue engineering and drug delivery. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Snail powders have many medicine functions. This paper uses the powders as additives for fabrication of nanofibers by the electrospinning and the bubble electrospinning, such work has never been studied before in any open literature. Unsmooth nanofiber is observed, and small fibers have higher acid-proof and alkali-proof properties, and their main reasons are revealed. Snail's slime involved in the powder has a fast immobilization property, and the immobilization process will blocks surface motion of the spun jets during the spinning process. Potential applications of the unsmooth nanofibers are predicted. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Indium tin oxide (ITO) film was deposited by the traditional direct current (DC) pulsed magnetron sputtering technology. With the increase of reverse time from 0 to 4.0 mu s, the crystal structure of ITO film changed from the polycrystalline structure without preferred orientation to (1 0 0) preferred orientation. ITO film with (1 0 0) preferred orientation showed the satisfactory optical and electrical properties, such as the band gap in 4.15 eV and carrier concentration in 4.25 x 10(20)/cm(3). Based on DC pulsed voltage waveform, the formation of (1 0 0) preferred orientation, as well as the change of optical and electrical properties of ITO film, were analyzed logically.

AB This work aims to solve the difficulty of V2O5 nanomaterials to exhibit both high specific capacitance and long cycling life as supercapacitor electrodes. Novel 3D V2O5 nanocorals with continuous size-gradient mesopore channels have been constructed by clustering and focusing of V2O5 nanobelt bundles. The 3D V2O5 nanocorals exhibit a specific capacitance as high as 414 F/g at 0.3 A/g. Even after 3000 cycles, the 3D V2O5 nanocorals maintain 70% of initial specific capacitance, which surpasses the cycling lifes of common V2O5 materials. Construction of continuous size-gradient mesopore channels is proven to be effective strategy to simultaneously enhance the specific capacitance and cycling life of V2O5 materials. This work has provided new insights into the design and preparation of soluble transition-metal based nanomaterials for high performance supercapacitors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Solar cells; Bi2S3 nanoparticles and nanorods; XRD; FTIR
ID NANOCOMPOSITE
AB One-dimensional nanostructures have gained more attraction in recent years because of their high aspect ratio. Uniform Bi2S3 nanorods have been grown using N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and ethylene glycol (EG) as solvents by solvothermal method, inorder to study the effect of solvent on the properties of the prepared Bi2S3. Also, the reaction temperature has been changed to examine its role in tuning the property of the Bi2S3 nanorods. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) results show that the Bi2S3 nanorods are of orthorhombic phase. The high resolution scanning electron microscope (HRSEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) studies reveal the appearance of rod-like structures with the typical length in the range of 1 mu m and average diameter is around 150 nm. The solvent effects and reaction temperatures are discussed in detailed. The band gap of the prepared samples have been estimated using Tauc plot and this suggests that the prepared Bi2S3 nanostructures may find potential applications in the fabrication of solar cells.

AB A novel anti-adhesive NC/WC:C surface processing is presented enabling green machining of ductile materials at elevated temperatures. The duplex coatings are produced by the active screen plasma nitrocarburising followed by physical vapour WC:C deposition. Microstructure analysis showed that duplex NC/WC:C system is composed by a nanolayered low adhesive WC:C coating and an extra load-bearing NC hardened case, obtaining favourable frictional properties at elevated temperatures. The coefficient of friction of duplex coating NC/WC:C was significantly lower compared to sole WC:C coating or untreated surfaces, and as demonstrated, depending on the testing temperature non-linearly, including an ultra-low adhesion at 350 degrees C. Furthermore, the quantified adhesion rate is clearly correlated with the nanomechanical properties especially the elastic parameters. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chain conformation of surface tethered poly(acrylamidoxime) brushes plays an important role in increasing their uranium adsorption capacity in seawater. In this work, poly(acrylamidoxime) brushes are prepared via surface-initiated activators regenerated by electron transfer atom-transfer radical polymerization. For the first time, in situ neutron reflectivity experiments are employed to investigate the conformation of poly(acrylamidoxime) brushes in deuterated water containing UO22+ ions. It is found that the poly(acrylamidoxime) brushes shrink when UO22+ ions are adsorbed due to the multiple coordination effect. However, this phenomenon is unfavorable for further adsorption of UO22+ ions in poly(acrylamidoxime) brushes because UO22+ ions solutions are subsequently discharged from the polymer brushes.

ID ION BATTERIES
AB Inorganic/organic hybrid materials composed by iron atoms bonded to an alkyl phosphate can be easily synthesized by mixing at 110 degrees C iron chlorides with tri-alkyl phosphates.
   Since structural information on these products are lacking and taking into account that lithium/iron organic hybrid materials are important in lithium ion battery technology we report here the physicochemical characterization of different hybrid lithium/iron butylphosphates. These materials are characterized by the presence of elongated hexagonal crystals stable up to 315 degrees C. The insertion of lithium does not affect the local structure. Thanks to such structures the material can be electrochemically-cycled and Li ions can find facilitated pathways for travel and redox reactions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID MOLECULAR-SIEVES
AB Structural defects in both MCM-41 (Mobil Composition of Matter No. 41) framework and V2O5 nanocrystals and surface acid sites of the V2O5/MCM-41 hybrid nanomaterials were quantitatively determined. Oxygen defects were found to be related to Lewis acid sites in the materials. In the oxidative desulfurization of a model diesel, dibenzothiophene conversion was almost proportional to the number of Lewis acidity and generally correlated with the oxygen defects concentration in V2O5. This work confirmed that increasing surface Lewis acidity and oxygen defect concentration is an effective route to improve the catalytic activity in the oxidation of sulfur compounds.

AB The successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method was employed to deposit the un-doped CdS and Pb-doped CdS quantum dots (QDs) with different doping concentrations over the TiO2 nanostructures. The systematic investigations of photoanode were carried out and the observed results reveal that the deposited sensitized layer has spherical morphology. Polycrystalline nature of the deposited film was observed, but the characteristic peaks for Pb or PbS are not observed. However, the presence of lead was confirmed through energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX) and elemental mapping study. The superior optical absorption and photovoltaic performance were observed in the 2% Pb-doped CdS QDs sensitized cell. The corresponding cell parameter values such as eta, J(sc), V-oc and FF were 1.19%, 3.76 mA/cm(2), 0.61 V and 51.5% respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study is to develop semi-transparent perovskite solar cells using graphene electrodes for high-efficiency tandem application. Two layers of graphene was considered optimum for perovskite solar cells, and this was confirmed by evaluating the optical and electrical performance. The tandem cells were further studied by controlling the thickness of perovskite films using different spin speeds, and 3000 rpm was considered the optimum speed. The bandgap of Cl-doped perovskite thin films was 1.59 eV. Measurement of morphology and crystal structure confirmed a good level of crystallinity. This study also examined both the optical and electrical performance of the semi-transparent perovskite solar cells, to optimize the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the tandem application using silicon solar cells. To the best of our knowledge, the tandem cells demonstrated a total PCE of 18.1%, which is the highest value among those of other cells that have the same structure as that of tandem cells.

   fracture
ID TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; TENSILE DEFORMATION; YIELD-STRESS; ALLOYS
AB In contrast to other structural alloys, yield strength of nickel base superalloys either remains constant or increases with temperature up to 700-800 degrees C making them more suitable for high temperature structural applications. However, the increase in yield strength is usually accompanied by a decrease in ductility. The results of the present investigation describe the substurural evolution in a directionally solidified nickel base superalloy CM 247 DS LC during tensile deformation, where ductility is not impaired even when yield strength is highest (at 750 degrees C). Extensive TEM studies offer plausible dislocation based mechanisms for retention of high ductility at 750 degrees C. The highest yield strength is attributed to the presence of intersecting faults along with partials bounded by anti-phase boundary. However, high ductility is due to the formation of SISF inside gamma' precipitates. These mechanisms provide necessary impetus for further alloy development. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Research on the cutting-edge nano-fillers for designing dental restorative materials with excellent mechanical property and antibacterial performance is demanding and provoking work. In this study, we fabricated silver-loaded polycation functionalized nanodiamonds (Ag/QNDs) that harbored dual biocidal modes for use as reinforced filler in dental resin. As a result, by reason of homogeneous dispersion and strong bonding with resin matrix, Ag/QNDs-reinforced resin exhibited great improvement of Vickers hardness, flexural strength and modulus as compared with pure resins. Due to the combined bactericidal effect of Ag+ and cationic polymers, Ag/QNDs-containing composites had an excellent antibacterial activity even at a concentration of 1.0 wt% but without significant cytotoxicity. Therefore, development of the Ag/QNDs hybrid is expected to aid in significant improvement of lifetime and quality of dental restorative resin. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel BaTiO3-based ceramics with non-reducibility and colossal dielectric constant were successfully synthesized by conventional solid-state route through the doping of Sn ions. Electrical measurements indicate that the Sn-doped BaTiO3 ceramics show excellent dielectric and non-reductive properties. Compared with the Sn-doped BaTiO3 ceramics sintered in air, the dielectric constant, loss tangent and insulation resistance almost have no change for the samples sintered in H-2-N-2. The Sn-doped BaTiO3 ceramics sintered in H-2-N-2 show a colossal dielectric constant (1.2 x 10(4)@1 kHz), low loss tangent (similar to 1.0% at 1 kHz), and acceptable insulation resistance (4.5 x 10(10) Omega.cm).

AB The copper zinc tin sulphide (CZTS) alloy is a promising p-type earth abundant alloy that received profound attention as an electron driven dark catalyst in electrocatalytic reduction reaction. We report about fabrication of p-type CZTS film with the jet nebulizer assisted spray (JNS) coating technique. The electrocatalytic activity of the as-synthesized CZTS electrode is studied at tri-iodide reduction reactions and is tested as Pt-free electrocatalyst in proof-of-concept type device. Under identical experimental conditions the CZTS counter electrode- and platinum electrode-based dye-sensitised solar cells result similar photocurrent density of similar to 10 mA cm (2). These results encourage applications of the aero-sol controlled spray coated CZTS films as the Pt-free electrocatalyst, where reduction reaction takes a key role in energy conversion and biosensing.

AB Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films were synthesized by sulfurization of subsequently electrochemically deposited Cu/Sn/Zn metal precursors on Mo foil substrates in melted sulfur on air at the temperature of 440 degrees C close to the sulfur boiling point for 1 h. The films contain only CZTS phase with lattice parameters a = 5.422 +/- 0.002 angstrom and c = 10.811 +/- 0.006 angstrom and components at. % ratio: Cu/(Sn + Zn) = 1.05, Zn/Sn = 1.22, (Cu + Sn + Zn)/S = 0.93. The film surface is densely packed without cracks or pinholes. The obtained results show the practical ability to obtain CZTS thin films by a novel technically simple and low-cost liquid-based process. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study the resistance of cordierite and zircon to the cavitation erosion was investigated with the aim of possible spreading their application. Cavitation erosion test was applied using standard ultrasonic vibratory set up with stationary sample. Weight loss and image analysis measurements including morphological analysis of the formed pits were used for monitoring degradation during the cavitation erosion testing. The obtained results were discussed in order to compare and analyze degradation mechanism and the resistance of the investigated materials to cavitation erosion. Cordierite sample underwent less serious degradation, characterized by continual forming of new pits, while zircon degradation progressed by growth and merging of already formed pits.

ID SHAPE-MEMORY ALLOY
AB Microstructure and properties of laser cladded NiTi and NiTiCu coatings were investigated to reveal the effect of Cu addition in this system. The XRD and SEM results indicated that Cu addition formed a ternary phase TiNi0.8Cu0.2, distributed in the grain boundary region of the matrix. The microhardness of NiTiCu coating was much higher than that of NiTi coating, reaching 600-700 HV. The wear resistance was improved with the friction coefficient decreased by 25.8% and the wear loss decreased by almost 50%. This was due to the grain boundary strengthening and wetting effect caused by the intergranular ternary phase and the change of the phase transformation behavior. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Nanoindentation-induced phase transformation between silicon carbide (SiC) polymorphs has been investigated by a combined study of transmission electron microscopy and first principles calculations. In situ nanoindentation of 4H-SiC single crystals revealed the occurrence of a phase transformation from 4H to 3C in the vicinity of a crack. First principles calculations pointed out an extremely low energy barrier for this phase transformation, which could be attributed to the very smooth transition in the atomic and electronic structures across the 3C/4H interface. The phase transformation from 4H to 3C may retard the propagation of cracks and reduce the band gap of SiC. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Elongated micro-heterostructures formed by ZnO and TiO2 have been fabricated using a single step thermal treatment at 900 degrees C. ZnO, Ti and TiN powders have been used as precursors during the synthesis. The as-grown micro-heterostructures have been characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and cathodoluminescence (CL). Compositional analysis indicates that the ZnO microrods grow from a rutile-TiO2 base. The presence of a ternary compound Zn2TiO4 has been detected at the region between the Zn doped TiO2 base and the Ti doped ZnO microrod, as confirmed by XRD and EDS results. Luminescence of the heterostructures is formed by two main emissions at 3.2 and 1.5 eV, which correspond to the ZnO and the TiO2 regions, respectively. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cadmium Sulfide (CdS) thin films and nanoparticles were prepared by using simple Chemical Bath Deposition technique. The thickness of the prepared thin films are in the range of 106-117 nm. Better transmittance behavior in the visible region along with an energy gap around 2.3 eV of as-prepared CdS thin films confirms the candidature for solar cell applications. The structural analysis of the prepared thin films and nanoparticles was carried out by Powder X-ray diffraction technique using CuK alpha radiation. The scanning electron micrographs reveal that all the compounds have uniform crystallite structure. The energy dispersive X-ray analysis confirms the formation of pure cadmium sulfide nanoparticles. The reverse magnetization behavior was identified in all the compounds which confirm the diamagnetic property of CdS nanoparticles. The resultant compounds confirm the competent candidature for solar cells, photodiodes, light emitting diodes, nonlinear optics and heterogeneous photo catalysis. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Novel NaBi(MoO4)(2) nanorods were synthesized facilely by a one-step solvothermal method. The results showed the NaBi(MoO4)(2) nanorods were composed of nanoparticles in linear arrangement. The mean crystal size of the NaBi(MoO4)(2) nanoparticles was of 18.8 nm. The sensor based on NaBi(MoO4)(2) nanorods exhibited good gas-sensing properties towards alcohols especially n-butanol. The highest sensitivity to 100 ppm n-butanol was 30 at the optimal operating temperature of 370 degrees C without cross response to acetone, xylene and toluene. The sensor is a promising candidate for fast, sensitive and selective detection of n-butanol. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB India is developing at a faster rate in the current era. It needs usage of large amount fuel and electricity, which leads to increase the import of crude oil and huge greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Hence, air pollution in the metro cities is increased. To reduce these emissions, alternative fuel is to be used which emits less GHG emissions in the atmosphere. This review highlights the potential materials such as sweet Sorghum, Neem seed, Mahua seed, Sugarcane molasses, Jatropha etc. for producing biofuels. This article also discusses the promising blends and their effects on GHG emissions. This will helps India to sustainably develop its economy. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although wasted duck beak bone (DBB) has a potentially valuable use as a natural bone graft material, its poor mechanical properties limit its use for orthopedic applications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential use of DBB particle-coated synthetic hydroxyapatite (HAp) bi-layered scaffolds as novel scaffolds for bone regeneration. Porous DBB/HAp bi-layered scaffolds comprising inner HAp and outer DBB layers were fabricated using a polymeric template-coating technique. The frame of the bi-layered scaffold consisted of a dense HAp inner layer and porous DBB outer layer, in which DBB particles were interconnected, with rough surface. The compressive strength of the bi-layered scaffolds was not influenced by the DBB particle coating. In vitro evaluation of MG63 human osteoblast-like cells cultured for 7 and 14 days on the bi-layered scaffold showed greater cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation than those on the HAp scaffold (control). These results demonstrated the excellent potential of DBB/HAp bi-layered scaffolds as bone graft substitutes. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The amount of silicon dioxide was considered for the hydrophobicity of functional microspheres. The results showed that the surface of silicone rubber microspheres coated with nano-silica aggregates, and it formed micro-nano structure. The data of contact angle results demonstrated that the contact angle of sample reached 150 degrees. With the increased amount of silicon dioxide with carbon-carbon double bonds, the data of contact angle slightly increased and tended to be stable. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, supercapacitive properties of un-doped and Cu doped Mo3N2 thin films developed by reactive magnetron co-sputtering technique are reported. X-ray diffraction (XRD) investigation confirmed the cubic phase of Mo3N2 and the addition of Cu to Mo3N2 did not change the crystal structure. The presence of Cu in this Mo3N2 was further confirmed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX). The electrochemical supercapacitive performance of the needle/cone shaped thin film electrodes were investigated using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques. The measurements showed an areal capacitance of 173.4 mF cm(-2) for the un-doped and 619.5 mF cm(-2) for the Cu doped Mo3N2 at a scan rate of 5 mV s(-1) in 1 M KOH and the excellent cycling stability of 80% capacitance retention over 2000 cycles. The results suggested that the prepared Mo3N2 based electrodes are excellent candidate materials for high-performance supercapacitors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ti-5553 is one of the most exhaustively studied metastable beta Ti alloys for load-bearing applications thanks to its excellent properties. The effect of partially replacing V with Nb on phase transformations and mechanical properties of Ti-5553 was evaluated here. The modified alloy presented similar beta phase decomposition and alpha phase precipitation behaviors, thus generating microstructures and mechanical properties very similar to those of the original alloy. However, hardenability was significantly improved, suggesting that this new alloy is promising for the manufacture of large section parts when beta phase retention during processing is important.

Raman active stretching W-O vibration mode at 889 cm(-1), PL blue green emission of intrinsic WO66- complex with double emission center (3T(1u)-1A(1g)) and FTIR spectrum confirmed NiWO4 formation with a calculated band gap of 2.86 eV. The much higher photocurrent of 0.03 mA/cm(2) was obtained at 0 V potential under visible light due to higher band gap (2.86 eV) of nanoberries morphology which led to efficient light absorption and increase in electron and hole separations.

AB Transition metal nitrides have attracted significant attention for energy storage applications due to their unique structural, electronic and catalytic properties. In this study, chromium nitride thin films have been deposited on 304L steel substrate by reactive magnetron DC sputtering and then it used as a supercapacitor electrode without additional processing. These films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX, Oxford Instruments), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. XRD spectra shows the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) planes of the cubic phase of CrN film. The Raman spectra of CrN thin film shows the acoustic vibrational mode at 238 cm(-1), and optical mode at 619 cm(-1). The FE-SEM images show the columnar structure of CrN thin films. The electrochemical properties were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The working electrode showed remarkably high specific capacitance of 41.6 F/g at the scan rate of 5 mV/s. The working electrode depicted high capacitance retention of 87% up to 2000 cycles. The electrochemical performance of the CrN showed that they can be used as potential electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, organic photosensitizer has been synthesized for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The solar cells then fabricated have been characterized by photocurrent-voltage characteristics and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements. The effect of outdoor temperature on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs has also been investigated here. The results indicate that DSSC shows power conversion efficiency of 2.58% at 25 degrees C under air mass (AM) 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW/cm(2). It has also been found out that the efficiency of DSSCs drops with the rise of temperature. The decrease in efficiency can be attributed to decrease in open-circuit voltage of cells. The EIS analysis shows that increase in temperature also reduces the charge recombination resistance mainly due to decrease of electron lifetime. These findings demonstrate that the cell is stable up to 35 degrees C. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this research a mixture of 90% wt of industrial residues (recycled soda-lime glass and ashes from a coal power thermal plant) have been vitrified for their use as "secondary raw material". Then, a glaze suspension was prepared to be applied on the porcelain stoneware tile. The tested pieces have been fired by a conventional porcelain cycle at 1180 degrees C of maximum temperature. The XRD, XRF, SEM/EDS and the dilatometric analysis have been the instrumental techniques used to characterize the material. Finally, an ecological glass-ceramic glaze perfectly fitting on porcelain ceramic tile has been produced, exhibiting a unique phase, anorthite, which ensures a high flexural strength (around 96 MPa) and a significant Vickers microhardness of 250 GPa, improving the mechanical properties of a conventional the porcelain ceramic tile.

AB Dynamic transformation is shown to take place in steels and titanium alloys at temperatures above and below the beta transus, respectively. Here the hard phase transforms into a softer phase during deformation. This unusual metallurgical phenomenon has previously been explained in terms of transformation softening (Ghosh et al., 2016). In the present work, compression tests were performed on samples of Zircaloy-4 at temperatures below the beta transus. The microstructures and microhardness measurements indicate that alpha transforms displacively into beta during deformation at temperatures down to about 75 degrees C below the transus.

The as-spun fibers were calcined at 700, 800, and 900 degrees C for 2 h to crystallization of MgAl2O4. X-ray diffraction result detected the crystalline phase of MgAl2O4. Field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images revealed that MgAl2O4 nanofibers had rough surfaces with diameters ranging from 323 to 377 nm and confirmed the polycrystalline structure. UV-vis DRS spectra showed strong absorption bands in UV-light regions. These results indicated that calcination temperature affected the morphological, structural, and optical properties of MgAl2O4.

AB Considering the increasing interest for protein immobilization on nanoparticles, in this work, we demonstrate the preparation of poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) (PSMA) nanoparticles and their capability to conjugate the proteolytic enzyme papain. PSMA nanoparticles were fabricated by combining precipitation and electrospray technique. Different experimental conditions were tested in order to optimize nanoparticle dimensions and production yield and different techniques were used to characterize the produced nanoparticles. Their mean diameter was found to be 176 nm. The successful papain-nanoparticle conjugation was then demonstrated. The residual catalytic activity of the conjugated enzyme was studied and found to be around 79% respect to the free enzyme. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Graphite coating was created on PP interface for an efficient microwave welding process. The graphite powder (GP) can significantly absorb microwave energy and transform into a large amount of heat upon the electromagnetic absorbent, leading to a sharp increase in temperature that can rapidly melt the interface of PP substrates and form a new structure where the GP was covered. The welding area of PP/GC samples obtained by microwave irradiation exhibited uniform surface appearance and high electric conductivity. Meanwhile, the PP/GC/PP samples showed high interfacial strengths, which were influenced by the duration of microwave welding, the size and content of GP in solder. And the bonding stress under optimal condition was about 2.17 MPa, which demonstrated great potential in plastic bonding and material processing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As for immiscible Mg-Ti alloys, how the microstructures and properties change during rapid quenching, which would finally decide their functions, is of significance. Thus, microstructure evolutions and elastic constants of immiscible Mg100-XTiX (X = 1, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50) alloys have been studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The Energy-Temperature (E-T) curves and Cluster Type Index Method (CTIM-2) are adopted to analyze the evolution of microstructures. Results show that the crystallization temperature T-c is enhanced with the increase of Ti content X. As the content X of Ti is at 1 and 10, the main structures in system are predominant fcc (12 0 0 0 12 0) coexisting with minor hcp (12 0 0 0 6 6) clusters, and whose values of E and G are both close to 40GPa and 16GPa, respectively. As X is in the range from 20 to 50, the main structures are bcc (14 6 0 8 0 0) clusters. Their values of E and G are close to 70 GPa and 25 GPa. Especially, the G/B ratio reveals that these alloys are all ductile materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ni doped Aurivillius Bi6Fe2Ti3O18 (xBFNTO, x = 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9) thin films with greatly enhanced ferromagnetism have been successfully synthesized on fused quartz substrate using a non-toxic solution-based method. The use of earth abundant materials and convenient annealing processes imply the great potential on industrial manufacture of multiferroic information storage. It can be found that Ni ions doping not only leads to an enlarged crystal lattice but also contributes to the formation of larger and column-like grains compared with pure BFTO thin film. Besides, Raman spectroscopy makes additional remarks on the specific doping position of Ni ions. Most importantly, highly improved magnetism has been detected by M-H curves which can be resulted from the anti-DM interaction. The doping level of Ni and magnetization of xBFNTO shows non-linear relationship which is possible to be explained by multivalent Ni ions (Ni2+, Ni3+), and the optimum doped concentration has been explored at x = 0.6 (M-s at 4.806 emu/cm(3)). This work moves a solid step on studies of layer-structured Aurivillius compounds. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A novel multicolor-tunable lanthanide doped 12CaO center dot 7Al(2)O(3) (Ln(3+):C12A7; Ln(3+) = Yb3+, Tm3+ and Er3+) synthesized by solid-state reaction method would greatly enhance the scope of its applications ranging from infrared solar cells to field emission display. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterize the morphology of Ln(3+):C12A7. Under 980 nm excitation, the emission color was tuned from green-yellow to red region through adjusting the concentrations of Ln(3+) ions. The obtained near infrared upconversion (UC) emissions in Ln(3+):C12A7 was corresponded to "window of optical transparency". All blue, green and red UC emissions were populated by one-photon process, and the proposed UC mechanisms were studied in Ln(3+):C12A7. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study the graphene oxide (GO) assisted biodegradation of brilliant green dye was studied in microbial fuel cell (MFC). The degradation of dye in MFC was characterized by reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and further analysis was performed by UV-Vis, and FTIR spectroscopy. The successful removal study of the brilliant green dye shows the superior bioactive characteristics of GO on MFC anode. The redox activity was studied during biofilm development via cyclic voltammetry (CV). However, the rational power density of 0.04 mW/cm(2) was calculated corresponding to current density of 0.00025 mA/cm(2). These observations indicated the influence of GO on MFC performance, which could further be improved by incorporating various GO composite materials. This study also highlights operational sustainability and an economical process to fabricate MFCs for their practical applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cadmium sulphide (CdS) quantum dots were synthesized via simple chemical precipitation technique under methanolic medium, while oleic acid is used as capping agent to control the particle size and to prevent agglomeration. The hexagonal wurtzite structure of the title compound was revealed through powder X-ray diffraction analysis. The CdS quantum dots exhibited strong absorption and luminescent properties in the visible region. Dynamic light scattering analysis gives the hydrodynamic diameter of the prepared CdS product. Field emission scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope analyses confirm the spherical morphology and give the particle size of the synthesized CdS sample. These findings would be helpful in determining the suitability of the CdS quantum dots to photovoltaic device applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Kesterite type CZTS (Cu2ZnSnS4) thin films were deposited on Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates by simple sol-gel method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern showed the presence of crystalline kesterite phase, whereas the electron microscopic (FESEM) analysis established the 1D morphology of the CZTS films. Electrical studies revealed the interesting bistability phenomena of CZTS films. The currentvoltage (I-V) characteristics showed two distinct paths for forward and reverse sweep directions. Conducting AFM (C-AFM) studies also supported the bistability phenomena of the CZTS films. Present study on electrical bi-stability of the CZTS thin films will help to understand the defects in the absorber materials and the photovoltaic performance of the CZTS device.

AB We propose Bowdon-Johnson-Kendall-Roberts model to measure the critical shear stress of circular point contact, and the critical shear stress map is constructed through the lateral force mode and force map mode of Atomic Force Microscope to research the interface property of nanomaterials. The mean critical shear stresses are measured as 0.24 MPa for monolayer MoS2 and 0.69 MPa for graphene. MoS2 nanosheet and graphene are of the lower critical shear stress and friction coefficient than those of the bulk materials, which are good agreement with the regularities in nanotribology. The critical shear stress can be used to not only quantitatively characterize the frictional properties, but also analyze the friction at different loading stages. The critical shear stress map would play an important role in sliding contact of nanomaterials for the drive part design and nanotribological reliability of nanoelectronic mechanical system.

AB High quality diamond like carbon (DLC) films are urgent demanded for inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments. DLC films with excellent qualities were deposited on Si microspheres by coupling anode-layer ion source and RF magnetron sputtering. The obtained films were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Reflectivity (XRR) and nanoindentation techniques. The films deposited under coupling anode-layer ion source and RF magnetron sputtering exhibit denser microstructure and smoother surface with lower surface roughness. Meanwhile, the mechanical properties and mass density of these films experience an improvement compared to those only prepared by either conventional RF magnetron sputtering or anode-layer ion source. DLC films deposited by coupling anode-layer ion source and RF magnetron sputtering can be a better candidate for ICF experiments. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Traditional document-level sentiment analysis fails to consider sentiment sequence within documents. This research paper proposes a novel perspective of sequence-based document sentiment analysis for discovering sentiment sequence and clustering sentiments for Email data. The proposed scheme of approach applies a trajectory clustering algorithm to Email trajectories transformed from sentiment features generated from SentiWordNet lexicon for discovering sentiment sequence within topic and temporal pattern distributions on the basis of trajectory clusters and their representative trajectories. Experiments conducted on real Email data provide evidence on proving the feasibility of the proposed technique and justifying the indispensability of sentiment sequence within documents in the determination of sentiment polarity.

AB This paper presents an innovative operationalization of world-system analysis through attributional data, and makes use of an innovative Artificial Neural Network computational tool, the Auto-Contractive Map (AutoCM), to analyze the core-periphery structure of a database including five well-known, publicly available indicators that can jointly be considered an empirical proxy of an open society formulation of Western governmentality: World Competitiveness Index; Freedom of Press Index; Economic Freedom Index; Corruption Perception Index; and UNDP Human Development Index. We find clear evidence of a core periphery structure in the data, which is largely coherent with a benchmark version obtained through an alternative computational method, the Self-Organizing Map (SOM). Moreover, we find that the resulting meta-geography of the world-system is still shaped by the colonialist geopolitics of the British Commonwealth as the key organizational backbone.

AB Predictive analytics has become an important topic in expert and intelligent systems, with broad applications across various engineering and business domains, such as the prediction of exchange rate in finance, weather and demand for energy using mixture of experts. However, selection of the number of experts and assignment of the input to individual experts remain elusive, especially for highly nonlinear and nonstationary systems. This paper presents a novel mixture of experts, namely, nonparametric multi scale Gaussian process (MGP) experts to predict the dynamic evolution of such complex systems. Concretely, intrinsic time-scale decomposition is first used to iteratively decompose the time series generated from such complex systems into a series of proper rotation components and a baseline trend component. Those components delineate the true time-frequency-energy patterns of the complex systems at different granularity. A Gaussian process (GP) expert is then applied on each component to predict the system evolution at each scale. MGP circumvent the tedious selection and assignment problems via the non parametric ITD. Summation of those individual forecasts represents the overall evolution of the original time series. Case studies using synthetic and real-world data elucidated that the proposed MGP model significantly outperforms conventional autoregressive models, composite GP model, and support vector regression in terms of prediction accuracy, and it is particularly effective for multi-step forecasting.

AB This paper considers a shared scheduling environment for distributed manufacturing resources. In this paper, we proposed a multi-agent system based approach to promote competition and cooperation among multi-agents and to achieve global optimal scheduling. We first build two multi-agent system (MAS) architectures. One is enterprise multi-agent subsystem (Sub-EMAS) architecture comprises job agents, resource agents and manager agents; the other one is enterprise alliance multi-agent system (EA-MAS) architecture involves the addition of a mediator agent and a scheduling agent. Then we design a Shared Contract Net Protocol (SCNP) to support both the Sub-EMAS and EA-MAS. We propose two heuristic algorithms to solve the scheduling model. The computational experiments show that the EA-MAS, with the integration of shared resource information, is able to provide shared scheduling scheme for distributed manufacturing with a good performance.

AB Since the advent of blogging, microblogging, and social networking sites, researchers and practitioners have been increasingly concerned with the problem of obtaining useful evaluations from web-based opinion articles in a process known as opinion mining or sentiment analysis. In this study, we focused on reviews based on highly emotion-embedded products/services, such as movies, music, and drama. Furthermore, we tried to solve the multiple polarities problem for the same review word for multiple types of product/service. First, we collected text written in Chinese from a Taiwanese movie forum. In our proposed approach, we applied an evolutionary strategy algorithm to optimize the weight tables corresponding to two different types of movies: horror and drama movies. The experimental results indicated that the proposed method performed better than conventional methods when considering only one generalized type. Further, we employed a new multi-class support vector machine approach for predicting opinions at the document level. We used seven measures to describe the characteristics of an overall document, including the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the predicted sentence value distribution, where the fluctuations in these values corresponded to their positions in the document. We also demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach for identifying opinions at the document level. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Breast cancer is becoming pervasive with each passing day. Hence, its early detection is a big step in saving the life of any patient. Mammography is a common tool in breast cancer diagnosis. The most important step here is classification of mammogram patches as normal-abnormal and benign-malignant.
   Texture of a breast in a mammogram patch plays a significant role in these classifications. We propose a variation of Histogram of Gradients (HOG) and Gabor filter combination called Histogram of Oriented Texture (HOT) that exploits this fact. We also revisit the Pass Band - Discrete Cosine Transform (PB-DCT) descriptor that captures texture information well. All features of a mammogram patch may not be useful. Hence, we apply a feature selection technique called Discrimination Potentiality (DP). Our resulting descriptors, DP-HOT and DP-PB-DCT, are compared with the standard descriptors.
   Density of a mammogram patch is important for classification, and has not been studied exhaustively. The Image Retrieval in Medical Application (IRMA) database from RWTH Aachen, Germany is a standard database that provides mammogram patches, and most researchers have tested their frameworks only on a subset of patches from this database. We apply our two new descriptors on all images of the IRMA database for density wise classification, and compare with the standard descriptors. We achieve higher accuracy than all of the existing standard descriptors (more than 92%). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study is concerned with group decision making contexts in which linguistic preference relations are used to provide the evaluations of results. On the one hand, granulation of linguistic terms, which are used as entries of the preference relations, is carried out for the purpose of dealing with the linguistic information. Formally, the problem is expressed as a multi-objective optimization task in which a performance index composed of the weighted averaging of the criteria of consensus and consistency is maximized via an appropriate association of the linguistic terms with information granules formed as intervals. On the other hand, once the linguistic terms are made operational by mapping them to the corresponding intervals, a selection process, in which the consistency achieved by each agent is also considered, is employed with intent to construct the solution to the decision problem under consideration. An experimental study is reported by demonstrating the main features of the proposed approach. Furthermore, some drawbacks and advantages are also analyzed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recently, the interest of the researchers has grown in post-optimality analyses, with the search for intrinsic properties of the optimal solutions of a given problem. Innovization has been defined as a process of knowledge discovery, in the form of mathematical relationships between variables, objectives, constraints, and parameters, from the output of an optimization problem. Genetic Programming (GP) is a bio-inspired metaheuristic capable of automatically evolving programs that can be used in this process. In spite of its wide applicability, GP techniques can present some issues when tackling knowledge discovery problems. Here, three modifications are proposed in a GP technique available in the literature for Innovization problems: (i) a method to ensure the consistency of the units of the principles using protected operations that ignore invalid terms, (ii) a strategy to avoid trivial solutions, and (iii) the use of an external archive to store the solutions of interest found during the search. Computational experiments are presented using four engineering case studies (namely, a two-member-truss, a welded beam, the cutting of a metal part, and a composite gear) to verify the capacity of the proposed GP method in finding design principles.

   Contextual information; Task modeling; Decision making
AB A Contextual Graph is based on the Contextual Graph formalism, which allows experts to realistically model the possible ways a task can be realized (i.e., practices). The power of Contextual-Graphs relies on their capability of considering the situation-dependent data (i.e., contextual information) that characterizes a task realization. Through successful experiences applying this formalism in several fields (e.g. medicine, transport, and military) it has been identified a clear need for an alternative representation of tasks that require an immediate response to an event (e.g. an incident in the Parisian subway). Decision makers have expressed their interest in a model that allows them to quickly identify the contextual information needed to elaborate and develop a practice. Moreover, in task realizations in which either a real object (e.g. a medical image), or an object of the reasoning (e.g. a strategy for driving in a freeway) corresponds to a practice output, a graph representation is not the clearest visualization, nor the fastest support for decision makers. The purpose of this paper is to offer a tree view of practices in a Contextual Graph. Such tree representation responds to the decision makers needs, providing another outlet for analyzing a task realization and its outputs. Moreover, the automatic generation of this view was implemented as a feature of the CxG software. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Classification procedure is an important task of expert and intelligent systems. Developing new algorithms of classification which improve accuracy or true positive rates could have an influence on some life problems such as diagnosis prediction in medical domain. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods are expected to search the best alternative according to some criteria. Each criterion has a value relative to each alternative. There are only two sets: a set of criteria and a set of alternatives. This work merges MCDM methods TOPSIS and VIKOR and modifies them to be used for classification where the used sets are three: the classes, the objects and the attributes (features) describing the objects. Hence, ATOVIC, a new classification algorithm is proposed. In ATOVIC, criteria are replaced by features and alternatives are replaced by objects. The latter belong to corresponding classes. Two sets are employed one serves as reference and second serves as test. An object from test set will be classified to the relative class based on the reference set. ATOVIC is applied on a benchmark (UCI) CLEVELAND data set to predict heart disease. Following the complexity of the data set and its importance, ATOVIC application is done on different test sets of CLEVELAND using binary classification and multi-classification. Moreover, ATOVIC is applied to thyroid data set to detect hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism diseases. The obtained results show the efficiency of ATOVIC in medical domain. In addition, ATOVIC is applied to three other data sets: chess, nursery and titanic, from UCI and KEEL websites. The obtained results are compared to those of some classifiers from literature. The experimental results demonstrate that ATOVIC method improves accuracy and true positive rates comparing to most classifiers considered from literature. Hence ATOVIC is promising for use in prediction or classification. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB epsilon-support vector regression (epsilon-SVR), as a direct implementation of the structural risk minimization principle rather than empirical risk minimization principle, is a new regression method with good generalization ability and can efficiently solve small-sample learning problems. In this work, through incorporating gradient information into the traditional epsilon-SVR, the gradient-enhanced epsilon-SVR (GESVR) is developed. The efficiency of GESVR is compared with the traditional epsilon-SVR by employing analytical function fitting, compared with the gradient-enhanced least square support vector regression (GELSSVR) by using two real-life examples, and tested in a scenario where the exact gradient information is unknown. The results show that GESVR provides more accurate prediction results than the traditional epsilon-SVR model, and outperforms GELSSVR in some real-life cases. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB During the last decade, sampling based methods for motion and path planning have gained more interest. Specifically, in the field of robotics, approaches based on the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm have become the customary technique for solving the single-query motion planning problem. However, dynamic large maps still represent a challenging scenario for these methods to produce fast enough results. Taking advantage of an NVidia CUDA-enabled Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), we present quad-RRT, an extension of the bi-directional strategy to speed up the RRT when dealing with large-scale, bidimensional (2D) maps. Designed for modern GPUs, quad-RRT computes four trees instead of the two ones built by the bidirectional approaches. This modification aims balancing the direct searching ability of these methods with the parallel exploration of those parts of the map at both sides of the path joining the initial and goal poses. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides a significant speedup dealing with large-scale maps densely populated by obstacles, when compared to other implementations of the RRT. Hence, the algorithm can have a high impact in the field of inspection path planning for distributed infrastructure. It is also a promising approach to allow new generation robots, designed to work in unconstrained environments, dynamically plan large-scale paths. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Classification of gender from images of handwriting is an interesting research problem in computerized analysis of handwriting. The correlation between handwriting and gender of writer can be exploited to develop intelligent systems to facilitate forensic experts, document examiners, paleographers, psychologists and neurologists. We propose a handwriting based gender recognition system that exploits texture as the discriminative attribute between male and female handwriting. The textural information in handwriting is captured using combinations of different configurations of oriented Basic Image Features (oBIFs). oBIFs histograms and oBIFs columns histograms extracted from writing samples of male and female handwriting are used to train a Support Vector Machine classifier (SVM). The system is evaluated on three subsets of the QUWI database of Arabic and English writing samples using the experimental protocols of the ICDAR 2013, ICDAR 2015 and ICFHR 2016 gender classification competitions reporting classification rates of 71%, 76% and 68% respectively; outperforming the participating systems of these competitions. While textural measures like local binary patterns, histogram of oriented gradients and Gabor filters etc. have remained a popular choice for many expert systems targeting recognition problems, the present study demonstrates the effectiveness of relatively less investigated oBIFs as a robust textual descriptor.

AB In this article, a novel approach is proposed for automatic detection and diagnosis of mammographic masses, one of the common signs of non-palpable breast cancer. However, detection and diagnosis of mass are difficult due to its irregular shape, variability in size, and occlusion within breast tissue. The main aim of this study is to classify masses into benign and malignant after detecting them automatically. We propose an iterative method of high-to-low intensity thresholding controlled by radial region growing for the detection of masses. Based on the observation that in presence of mass orientation of tissue patterns changes, which may differ from benign to malignant, a multi resolution analysis of orientation of tissue patterns is then performed to categorize them. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated with images from the digital database for screening mammography (DDSM), containing 450 benign masses, 440 malignant masses, and 410 normal images. A sensitivity of 85.0% is achieved at 1.4 false positives per image in mass detection, whereas an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92 with an accuracy of 83.30% is achieved for the diagnosis of malignant masses.

ID DIRECT LOAD CONTROL; SMART
AB Demand Side Management (DSM) has been a subject of much research due to the demand of strategies which enable the development of power generation, transmission and distribution in Smart Grids (SG). Throughout the years, many authors have applied mathematical programming and, or, metaheuristic methods for obtaining a satisfactory solution for load management, mainly considering only one performance function in their respective optimization approaches. However, in addition to maximum load peak minimization (an often used performance function), it may be interesting to deal with some other merit functions, such as energy production cost, costumer's preferences and constraints, among others. Due to this multi-criteria nature of this problem, in this paper it is proposed an exact multi-objective methodology to the optimal Demand Side Management. Essentially, the DSM problem is addressed by using an epsilon-constraint approach, in which one of the objectives is handled with Quadratic Programming whilst the others are considered as linear constrains. This paper also discusses the behavior of the solutions under the presence of uncertainties on the problem parameters due to possible unpredictable variations of the consumption pattern, energy price and number of appliances. The results, regarding the case studies analyzed, have shown promising solutions with interesting trade-off relations between power consumption and energy production cost. Moreover, the robustness analysis has indicated not sensitive solutions even when some parameters of the problem are varied, such as the energy price and the number of types of appliances, which can be regarded as a useful information for the utility.

AB MinHash is a widely-used method for efficiently estimating the amount of similarity between documents for Near-Duplicate Detection (NDD). However, it is based on the concept of set resemblance rather than near-duplication. In this study, Sectional MinHash (S-MinHash), specifically designed for the detection of near-duplicate documents, is proposed. The proposed method enhances the MinHash data structure with information about the location of the attributes in the document. The method provides an unbiased estimate of the Jaccard coefficient with a smaller variance as compared to the MinHash for same signature sizes. The experiment results showed that the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the proposed method was around one eighth of the MSE of the MinHash. Also, document NDD with the proposed method resulted in more accuracy in compare to the MinHash and the recent method, the BitHash. The best-captured F-measure was 87.05%. Setting the number of sections s to 2 gave the best results for the tested dataset. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents an evolving cloud-based algorithm for the recognition of drivers' actions. The general idea is to detect different manoeuvres by processing the standard signals that are usually measured in a car, such as the speed, the revolutions, the angle of the steering wheel, the position of the pedals, and others, without additional intelligent sensors. The primary goal of this investigation is to propose a concept that can be used to recognise various driver actions. All experiments are performed on a realistic car simulator. The data acquired from the simulator are pre-processed and then used in the evolving cloud-based algorithm to detect the basic elementary actions, which are then combined in a prescribed sequence to create tasks. Finally, the sequences of different tasks form the most complex action, which is called a manoeuvre. As shown in this paper, the evolving cloud-based algorithm can be very efficiently used to recognise the complex driver's action from raw signals obtained by typical car sensors.

AB We report simple and selective method for detection of vitamins B-1 and B-6 in brown and white rice samples using localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of sucrose capped gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as a chemical sensor colorimetrically. Here, detection is based on the color change of AuNPs from pink to blue followed by a red shift of LSPR absorption band in UV-vis region with the addition of vitamins B-1 and B-6 into the NPs solution. A good linear range was observed in the range of 25-1000 ngmL(-1) with detection limit of 8 ngmL(-1) for B-1 and 50-1000 ngmL(-1) with detection limit of 15 ngmL(-1) for vitamins B-6. The employment of AuNPs for detection of B-1 and B-6 vitamins in rice food samples showed remarkable abilities in terms of the simplicity, low cost, stability, reproducibility and sensitivity.

AB A screening method was explored for simultaneous analysis of 43 cephalosporins residues and their metabolites from four generations in shrimp utilizing a novel fully untargeted data acquisition method. Four generations of cephalosporins residues and their metabolites are extracted with online extraction simultaneously. Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry was used for to determine cephalosporins and their metabolites in ten shrimp species. Precision in terms of relative standard deviation (RSD) was under 6.3% for all compounds, and the extraction recoveries ranged from 85% to 108%. The detection capabilities ranged from 0.011 to 0.223 mg kg(-1). The fully untargeted vDIA acquisition way improves both selectivity and sensitivity for the compounds at trace levels, which is beneficial for screening performance.

AB Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in 2-monoacylglycerols form exhibit various biological activities and have potential applications in food and pharmaceuticals. Preparation of 2-monoacylglycerols was conducted by enzymatic enthanolysis. The effects of lipase type, substrate weight ratio, reaction time and lipase load on the 2-monoacylglycerols content in the crude product were investigated. Lipozyme 435 behaved as 1,3-specific and high-catalytic-activity lipase in this reaction. Under the optimal conditions (ethanol:oil = 3:1 (w/w), 8% Lipozyme 435, 3 h), 27% 2-monoacylglycerols were obtained. After solvent extraction of 2-monoacylglycerols, the abilities of low temperature crystallization and molecular distillation to concentrate 2-PUFA-monoacylglycerols were compared. Low temperature crystallization concentrated 81.13% and 74.29% PUFA by acetonitrile and hexane, respectively, with over 90% in 2-monoacylglycerol forms. Conversely, molecular distillation yielded a PUFA concentration of 72% but decreased the 2-monoacylglycerols content to 69.81%. Thus, the method including enzymatic ethanolysis and low temperature crystallization is suitable for preparation of 2-monoacylglycerols rich in PUFA.

AB The dynamics of water in sodium alginate film-forming solutions during drying were investigated by low-field nuclear magnetic resonance. At the beginning of drying, three transverse relaxation times at around 1.74, 28.48 and 305.38 ms were assigned to the tightly bound, moderately bound, and free water, respectively. Moreover, the free water was evaporated, followed by the formation of water cluster in the entangled alginate chains network as the drying process continued (beyond 840 min of drying time). Towards the third stage of drying process, water clusters in alginate samples was disappeared, resulting that loosely bonded waters were constrained within the weak-gel network. The observed three relaxation times revealed the multi-exponential relaxation behavior of water in alginate, which indicated that this polymer exhibited spatial heterogeneity during drying. On the basis of diffusive exchange theory, the dimension range of alginate network decreased from 1.94-23.99 to 1.83-6.62 mu m as the alginate films solidified.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate antioxidative activity of phenolic compounds extracted from germinated pulse seed including chickpeas, lentils and yellow peas. Phenolic compounds were extracted at different germination time and total phenolic content was examined by Folin Ciocalteu's reaction. Antioxidative activity of extracts was characterized by in vitro assay including 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging capacity (DPPH), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), iron-binding assay, and in stripped soybean oil-in-water emulsions. The results suggested that germination time is critical for phenolic compounds production. The form variation of phenolic compounds influenced the antioxidative activity of phenolic compounds both in vitro assay and in emulsion systems. Soluble bound phenolic compounds showed higher antioxidative ability in emulsion system with the order of chickpea > yellow pea > lentil. On the basis of these results, soluble bound phenolic compounds may be considered as a promising natural antioxidant to prevent lipid oxidation in foods.

AB Protein isolate was hydrolysed by Alcalase, thermolysin and trypsin. BBPH produced by Alcalase showed highest angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory properties (IC50:52 mu g/mL). Hydrolysates produced by Alcalase and thermolysin exhibited similar dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity (IC50:1.73 mg/mL), while low inhibitory activity was observed for hydrolysate produced by trypsin. BBPH also showed protective effect against oxidative stress with significant 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging and ferrous chelating activity. Bioactive peptides of BBPH produced by thermolysin showed better resistance to simulated gastrointestinal digestion (SGID), while the DPP-IV and ACE inhibitory properties were significantly reduced. Molecular weight distribution showed significant reduction in peptides of the molecular weight range 200-400 Da in BBPH produced by Alcalase, after SGID. LC-ESI-TOF-MS and in silico analysis showed the presence of potential peptides with both ACE and DPP-IV inhibitory properties in BBPH produced by thermolysin.

AB Misusage of porcine blood proteins, such as misbranding and substitution, can cause religious objections, law violation, and food quality concerns. These issues highlight the need for detecting unlabeled or overuse of porcine blood in foods. Compared with acidic and neutral pHs, porcine hemoglobin (P-Hb) at alkaline pH retained the best solubility, molecular integrity, and immunoreactivity after heat treatment. PHb at acidic and alkaline pHs remained stable during storage at 4 degrees C for 29 days. A monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific to mammalian hemoglobin, 13F7, was developed. A mAb13F7-based indirect competitive ELISA (icELISA) was optimized for the quantification of PHb in meat products. This assay had a wide working range from 0.5 ppm to 1000 ppm. It was sensitive (limit of detection: 0.5 ppm), precise and reproducible with low inter- and intra-coefficient of variances (< 20%). This assay is suitable for government, food industry, and third-party authority to surveillance food quality.

AB Innovative host-tailored polymers were prepared, characterized and used as recognition elements in potentiometric transducers for the selective quantification of 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP). The polymer beads were synthesized using DCP as a template molecule, acrylamide (AM), methacrylic acid (MAA) and ethyl methacrylate (EMA) as functional monomers and divinylbenzene (DVB) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as cross-linkers. The sensors were fabricated by the inclusion of MIPs in plasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) matrix. Response characteristics of the proposed sensors revealed anionic slopes of -59.2, -49.7 and -80.6 mV/decade with detection limits of 5.6x10(-5),5.9x10(-5) and 13.2x10(-5) mol/L for MIP/AM/DVB, MIP/MAA/DVB and MIP/EMA/EGDMA membrane based sensors, respectively. Good selectivity was observed over common inorganic/organic anions. Validation of the assay method according to IUPAC recommendations was justified ensuring the synthesis of good reliable novel sensors for DCP determination. The method was successfully applied for routine analysis of food taint in fish and fish farms water samples.

AB The effects of biopolymer encapsulation and sodium replacement combination technology on quality characteristics (i.e., bitter taste) and inhibition of sodium absorption from pork sausage in mice were evaluated. The sausages were divided into three different sodium replacement groups (none, 40%, and 50%) and three different biopolymer encapsulation groups (none, cellulose, and chitosan) in combination. In groups with 50% sodium replacement by KCl and MgCl2, T8 (chitosan encapsulation) showed the highest inhibition of the sodium absorption rate. However, chitosan encapsulation groups (T2, T5, and T8) had higher bitterness and lower overall acceptability than other treatment groups. In contrast, in the group with 40% sodium replacement by KCl, T4 (cellulose encapsulation) exhibited the highest inhibition of sodium absorption without a bitter taste. This is the first report showing that 40-50% sodium replacement combined with 3% cellulose encapsulation reduced sodium absorption from sausage by 60% without causing a bitter taste.

AB This study aimed to explore the possibility of using methionine sulfone (Msn)-containing orbitides as indicators to evaluate the oxidation process of flaxseed oils. Results showed that after 4 days' heating, oxidation values slightly increased (p > .05) with significant decrease in methionine (Met)-containing peptides (p < .05) instead of.-tocopherol (p > .05). However, as oxidation time continues increasing, oxidation values significantly increased (p < .05) with significant reduction of.-tocopherol (p < .05). It demonstrated that Met-containing peptides were more readily oxidized compared with.-tocopherol and showed certain antioxidant activity. Besides, high logarithmic correlations were found between oxidation values and Msn-containing orbitides (0.94-1.00), such as between total carbonyl compounds and orbitide [1-8-NaC],[1-MetO(2)]-CLE (64.95 lnx - 52.14, R-2 = 0.99, Dingya23 oil). Therefore, in comparison with common oxidation indices, Msn-containing orbitides may be better indicators for evaluating the oxidation process of flaxseed oil with superior separation efficiency, specific information and high stability.

AB This study was aimed at understanding why dietary polyphenols with a catechol skeleton tend to exhibit cancer chemopreventive activity by using a catechol-type stilbene (3,4-DHS) as a model molecule. Only a short-term cooperation of 3,4-DHS and exogenous Cu(II) exhibited a strong preferential ability to kill HepG2 cells over normal L02 cells. Mechanism studies reveal that this 3,4-DHS/Cu(II) system could produce extracellularly reactive oxygen species (ROS) and o-quinone through two sequential proton loss electron transfer followed by diffusion of ROS into cells, leading to higher intracellular accumulation of ROS, preferential disruption of redox homeostasis and more effective mitochondria-dependent apoptosis as well as necrosis of HepG2 cells than L-02 cells. This work provides further evidence that dietary catechol-type molecules show chemopreventive activity by virtue of their copper-dependent prooxidant action.

AB Cholecalciferol (D-3) and retinyl palmitate (RP) are the two main fat-soluble vitamins found in foods from animal origin. It is assumed that they are solubilized in mixed micelles prior to their uptake by intestinal cells, but only scarce data are available on the relative efficiency of this process and the molecular interactions that govern it. The extent of solubilization of D-3 and RP in micelles composed of lipids and sodium taurocholate (NaTC) was determined. Then, the molecular interactions between components were analyzed by surface tension and surface pressure measurements. The mixture of lipids and NaTC allowed formation of micelles with higher molecular order, and at lower concentrations than pure NaTC molecules. D-3 solubilization in the aqueous phase rich in mixed micelles was several times higher than that of RP. This was explained by interactions between NaTC or lipids and D-3 thermodynamically more favorable than with RP, and by D-3 self-association.

AB The residue sample storage stability of three organophosphorus pesticides, dichlorvos, diazinon, and malathion, under different conditions was investigated. The storage conditions studied included storage time, temperature, and sample form. The addition of extra enzyme to the samples was also studied to investigate its effect on stability. It was found that malathion was more unstable than dichlorvos and diazinon, there was an over 70% loss in 90 days even at -20 degrees C in coarsely chopped form. The pesticide residues were more stable when the cucumber was in homogenate form than coarsely chopped. Furthermore, the addition of catalase increased the degradation of malathion, where there was more decomposition with increasing levels of catalase. However, there was no obvious relationship between degradation of dichlorvos and diazinon and catalase concentration. Overall, this study revealed factors that can be optimized to increase the storage stability of organophosphorus pesticides, where enzyme was one of the main influencing factors.

AB Biogenic amines (BAs), a class of nitrogenous compounds that are frequently detected in wine, pose adverse effects to humans. However, with the largest red wine consumption in the world, little is known about national profiles correlating BAs in wines to toxicological/health risks in China. In this study, we conducted a nationwide survey of commercially available wines for the occurrence of BAs. Our sampling campaign covered >90% of wine brands (n = 456) in China in a three year span (2014-2016). The target BAs included tryptamine, phenylethylamine, putrescine, cadaverine, histamine, tyramine, spermidine and spermine. In order to quantitatively characterize the potential risk and/or support regulatory decision-making, chronic and acute BA exposure scenarios were developed and simulated with a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model. The model described the fate and transport of BAs within human body using physical descriptions of relevant processes. These results provided baseline data that are needed for the risk assessment of dietary uptake of BAs and evaluating winemaking processes by food safety authorities.

General increase in life expectancy and high prevalence of these diseases both in elderly and younger population emphasize the importance of developing safe and effective vaccines. In this review, at first the possible mechanisms and risk factors associated with chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and type 1 diabetes (T1D) are discussed. Current advances in the development of vaccines for such autoimmune diseases, particularly those based on DNA, altered peptide ligands and peptide loaded MHC II complexes are discussed in detail. Finally, strategies for improving the efficacy of potential vaccines are explored. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB National foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) control programme' is being implemented in India and therefore predicting vaccine match is a key surveillance task. Recently, a considerable proportion of field viruses (75.6%) showed antigenic drift from the existing serotype A vaccine strain A IND 40/2000 necessitating search for an alternate strain. Here, antigenic relationship ('r(1)' value) of 87 field viruses with each of the 8 candidate strains was estimated by virus neutralization test. A IND 2 7/2011 strain emerged to be the one with the widest spectrum of antigenic coverage showing 'r(1)' value of more than 0.3 with 81.6% of field strains. It achieved a reasonably high titre of log(10) 7.5 TCID50/ml in BHK-21 suspension cell which was accompanied by positive charge gaining substitutions (E-82-K and E-131-K in VP2) thought to have adaptive significance. However, potency trial remains to be conducted before A IND 27/2011 finds a place in the vaccine formulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To evaluate the reliability of information in general practice (GP) electronic health records (EHRs), 2100 adult patients were randomly selected for interview regarding the presence of specific medical conditions and recent influenza vaccination. Agreement between self-report and data extracted from EHRs was compared using Cohen's kappa coefficient (k) and interpreted in accordance with Altman's Kappa Benchmarking criteria; 377 (18%) patients declined participation, and 608 (29%) could not be contacted. Of 1115 (53%) remaining, 856 (77%) were active patients (>= 3 visits to the GP practice in the last two years) who provided complete information for analysis. Although a higher proportion of patients self-reported being vaccinated or having a medical condition compared to the EHR (50.7% vs 36.9%, and 39.4% vs 30.3%, respectively), there was "good" agreement between self-report and EHR for both vaccination status (kappa = 0.67) and medical conditions (kappa = 0.66). These findings suggest EHR may be useful for public health surveillance. Crown Copyright (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Seasonal influenza affects millions of people globally each year, causing significant morbidity and mortality. However, there remains substantial uncertainty about the attack rate (incidence) of influenza, particularly in unvaccinated individuals.
   Methods: We undertook a systematic review of vaccine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on laboratory-confirmed seasonal influenza in the placebo arm. We calculated the influenza attack rate from included studies as the number of laboratory-confirmed positive seasonal influenza cases in the placebo arm divided by the total number of subjects in this arm. A random effects meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the influenza attack rate among unvaccinated individuals (both symptomatic only as well as symptomatic and asymptomatic combined).
   Results: We included 32 RCTs that had a total of 13,329 participants. The pooled estimates for symptomatic influenza were 12.7% (95%Cl 8.5%, 18.6%) for children (<18 years), 4.4% (95%Cl 3.0%, 6.3%) for adults, and 7.2% (95%Cl 4.3%, 12.0%) for older people (65 years and above). The pooled estimates for symptomatic and asymptomatic influenza combined for all influenza were 22.5% (95%Cl 9.0%, 46.0%) for children and 10.7% (95%Cl 4.5%, 23.2%) for adults. Only one study was identified for symptomatic and asymptomatic combined in older people which had a rate of 8.8% (95%Cl 7.0%, 10.8%). There was substantial heterogeneity between studies.
   Conclusion: Overall, we found that approximately 1 in 5 unvaccinated children and 1 in 10 unvaccinated adults were estimated to be infected by seasonal influenza annually, with rates of symptomatic influenza roughly half of these estimates. Our findings help to establish the background risk of seasonal influenza infection in unvaccinated individuals. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: The VACCINE [Vaccine Against Cervical Cancer Impact and Effectiveness] study evaluated the prevalence of quadrivalent vaccine-targeted human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes (HPV 6, 11, 16, 18) amongst young women of vaccine-eligible age.
   Methods: Between October 2011 - June 2015, women aged 18-25 years from Victoria, Australia, were recruited through targeted advertising on the social networking website Facebook. Participants completed an online questionnaire and provided a self-collected vaginal swab for HPV DNA detection and genotyping (Linear Array HPV genotyping assay). Self-reported HPV vaccination details were verified with the National HPV Vaccination Program Register (NHVPR).
   Results: Of 1223 who agreed to participate, 916 (74.9%) completed the survey and, for 1007 (82.3%) sexually-active participants, 744 (73.9%) returned the self-collected swab, of which 737 contained detectable DNA 184/737 (25.0%) were positive for HPV. Vaccine-targeted HPV genotypes were detected in only 13 (1.7%) women: 11 HPV 16 (six vaccinated after sexual debut, five unvaccinated) and two HPV 6. Prevalence of any of HPV 31/33/45 collectively was 2.9%, varying significantly by vaccination status (fully 2.0%, unvaccinated 6.8%; p = 0.01). Vaccination rates among the sexually-active cohort were high, with 65.6%, 71.6% and 74.2% of participants having received three, at least two or at least one dose of vaccine, respectively. Of women self-reporting HPV vaccination, the NHVPR confirmed one or more doses were received in 90%. Strong associations were observed between vaccination status, age, language spoken at home and country of birth, as well as between HPV detection and the number of male sexual partners.
   Conclusion: Surveillance five to eight years' post-initiation of a national HPV vaccination program demonstrated a consistent and very low prevalence of vaccine-related HPV genotypes and some evidence of cross protection against related types amongst vaccine-eligible women from Victoria, Australia.

AB England's influenza vaccination programme targets persons with clinical risk factors, pregnant women, those aged 65 years and older and children. Low vaccine uptake amongst primary school children was previously found to be significantly associated with increasing deprivation, Black or Minority Ethnic (BME) and certain religions. It is unknown whether these population predictors are associated with vaccine uptake in other groups. GP level data for target groups during the 2015/16 and 2016/17 seasons were linearly regressed against various factors to determine potential predictors associated with variation in uptake.
   Adjusted uptake for 2-4 year olds during both seasons was more than 11% lower in the most deprived decile and more than 3% lower in 34%+ BME populations compared to the least deprived and non-BME populations. Pregnant women in deprived areas had significantly lower vaccine uptake than in non-deprived areas. Patients 16-64 years old at risk showed no significant variation in uptake by deprivation, whereas patients 65 years and older had more than 3% higher vaccine uptake in the least deprived populations than the most deprived populations. Areas with the highest Muslim and BME populations had a significantly higher vaccine uptake among patients ages 16 to under 65 years old in a clinical risk group than non-Muslim and non-BME populations during both seasons. Population-factors have different effects on vaccine uptake for the various target groups. These findings support segmenting public health activities to improve vaccine uptake and reduce inequalities. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: HPV vaccination programs have been introduced in large parts of the world, but monitoring of effectiveness is not routinely performed. Many countries introduced vaccination programs without establishing the baseline of HPV prevalences. We developed and validated methods to estimate protective effectiveness (PE) of vaccination from the post-vaccination data alone using references, which are invariant under HPV vaccination.
   Methods: Type-specific HPV prevalence data for 15-39 year-old women were collected from the pre- and post-vaccination era in a region in southern Sweden. In a region in middle Sweden, where no baseline data had been collected, only post-vaccination data was collected. The age-specific baseline prevalence of vaccine HPV types (vtHPV, HPV 6, 11, 16, 18) were reconstructed as Beta distributions from post-vaccination data by applying the reference odds ratios between the target HPV type and non-vaccine-type HPV (nvtHPV) prevalences. Older non-vaccinated age cohorts and the southern Sweden region were used as the references. The methods for baseline reconstructions were validated by computing the Bhattacharyya coefficient (BC), a measure for divergence, between reconstructed and actual observed prevalences for vaccine HPV types in Southern Sweden, and in addition, for non-vaccine types in both regions. The PE estimates among 18-21 year-old women were validated by comparing the PE estimates that were based on the reconstructed baseline prevalences against the PE estimates based on the actual baseline prevalences.
   Results: In Southern Sweden the PEs against vtHPV were 52.2% (95% CI: 44.9-58.5) using the reconstructed baseline and 49.6% (43.2-55.5) using the actual baseline, with high BC 82.7% between the reconstructed and actual baseline. In the middle Sweden region where baseline data was missing, the PE was estimated at 40.5% (31.6-48.5).
   Conclusions: Protective effectiveness of HPV vaccination can be estimated from post-vaccination data alone via reconstructing the baseline using non-vaccine HPV type data. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Tumor vaccines use various strategies to generate immune responses, commonly targeting generic tumor-associated antigens. The tumor lysate, particle-loaded, dendritic cell (TLPLDC) vaccine is produced from DC loaded with autologous tumor antigens, creating a patient-specific vaccine. Here, we describe initial phase lilla trial results.
   Methods: This trial includes patients with any stage solid tumors, ECOG <= 1, and >4 months lifeexpectancy. A personalized vaccine is created using 1 mg of tumor and 120 ml blood (to isolate DC). Primary vaccination series (PVS) is four monthly inoculations. Patients are followed per standard of care (SOC). Endpoints include safety and tumor response (RECIST v1.1).
   Results: 44 patients were enrolled and vaccinated consisting of 31 late stage patients with residual/measurable disease, and 13 disease-free patients after SOC therapies. While 4 patients progressed before completing the PVS, 12/31 (39%) demonstrated clinical benefit (2 complete responses, 4 partial responses, 6 stable disease). In the adjuvant setting, 46% of late stage patients remain disease free at a median of 22.5 months.
   Conclusions: The TLPLDC vaccine is scalable, generates a personalized DC vaccine, and requires little autologous tumor tissue and few DC. The vaccine is safe, with primarily grade 0-2 toxicities, and nearly 40% clinical benefit rate in varied tumors, warranting further study. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: With increased school-based vaccinations for improved coverage rates and practicality, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently endorsed research to identify possible interventions to reduce vaccine-related pain in mass clinical and school-based settings. In particular, the lack of research in adolescents indicate a particular need in this population. Acute exercise has analgesic effects and has been used as a behavioural adjuvant to vaccination. Here, we examine the effect of exercise on vaccine-related pain, anxiety and fear in adolescents, during a school-based program for HPV vaccinations.
   Methods: 116 students (Female: 61, Male: 55) aged 11-13 years were randomly allocated to either an Exercise (n = 60) or Control (n = 56) group. All participants completed demographic and Trait-anxiety questionnaires prior to receiving the vaccine according to usual care. The Exercise group also performed upper body exercise for 15 min prior to receiving the vaccine. Immediately after the vaccine administration, all participants reported on pain, anxiety and fear at the time of receiving the vaccine.
   Results: Female adolescents in the Exercise group reported significantly less pain (3.64; 95% CI, 2.984.30) than Controls (4.58; 95% CI, 3.96-5.19; p = 0.04). Further, females reported greater pain and anxiety than males in the Control group but not the Exercise group.
   Conclusion: This study supports the use of exercise prior to vaccine administration, especially in female adolescents who are particularly vulnerable to negative experiences during vaccination procedures. Furthermore, the ease of application, as well as the benefit of exercise, provides support for the use of simple exercise prior to vaccination in mass vaccination settings. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Delivering vaccination services during the second year of life (2YL) 1 provides countries with an opportunity to achieve greater coverage, to provide booster doses and vaccines missed during the first year of life, as well as contribute towards disease control and elimination goals.
   Methods: Using data from demographic health surveys (DHSS) conducted during 2010 to 2016, this paper explores the proportion of missed opportunities for vaccinations generally provided during routine immunization among children in their 2YL.
   Results: DHS data in 46 countries surveyed 478,737 children, from which 169,259 children were 12-23 months old and had vaccination/health cards viewed by surveyors. From this group, 69,489 children aged 12-23 months had contact with health services in their 2YL. Three scenarios for a missed opportunity for vaccinations were analysed: (1) a child received one vaccine in the immunization schedule and was eligible for another vaccine, but did not receive any further vaccination, (2) a child received a vitamin A supplementation (VAS) and was due for a vaccine, but did not receive vaccines that were due, and (3) a child was taken to a health facility for a sick visit and was due (and eligible) for a vaccine, but did not receive the vaccine. A total of 16,409 (24%) children had one or more missed opportunities for vaccinations.
   Conclusion: This analysis highlights the magnitude of the problem of missed opportunities in the 2YL. The global community needs to provide better streamlined guidance, policies and strategies to promote vaccination screenings at well-child and sick child visits in the 2YL. Where they do not exist, well-child visits in the 2YL should be established and strengthened. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and classical swine fever (CSF) are economically significant diseases that affect the swine industry worldwide. However, the current vaccination strategy, which uses two single live attenuated vaccines, can result in interference for each other. In addition, the universally used CSFV vaccine C-strain does not allow for differentiation of infected and vaccinated animals. In this study, rPRRSV-E2, PRRS virus (PRRSV) expressing CSF virus (CSFV) E2, was constructed by reverse genetics. The E2 gene of CSFV was inserted between ORF1b and ORF2 in the genome of the PRRS vaccine virus, HuN4-F112. A copy of transcriptional regulatory sequence 6 was inserted at the 3' terminal of the exogenous gene to produce CSFV E2 as a unique subgenomic mRNA transcript. The rPRRSV-E2 was stable for at least 25 serial cell passages. Single-shot intramuscular immunization of rPRRSV-E2 into pigs induced PRRSV-specific and CSFV-specific antibodies and fully protected pigs from lethal challenge with highly-pathogenic PRRSV and CSFV. These results demonstrate that a novel strategy for recombinant PRRSV production is effective, and suggest that rPRRSV-E2 is a promising live, virus-vectored vaccine against PRRS and a marker vaccine against CSF.

AB Background: Nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization is a pre-requisite for developing bacterial mucosal and invasive disease. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) immunization of children reduces their risk of colonization by vaccine-serotypes, which could affect the biome of the nasopharynx in relation to colonization by other bacteria. This study evaluated the association of PCV immunization on the prevalence density of nasopharyngeal colonization by common, potentially pathogenic bacteria.
   Methods: A multiplex qPCR assay was used to evaluate bacterial nasopharyngeal colonization by 7-valent PCV (PCV7) serotypes, non-vaccine serotypes (NVT), Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria meningitidis in PCV7-vaccinated and PCV-unvaccinated African children at two time points.
   Results: PCV7 vaccination was associated with a higher prevalence of NVT and H. influenzae at 9 and 16 months, respectively. While the prevalence of S. aureus was higher in PCV7-vaccinated children at 9 months, no difference was found at 16 months. The density of PCV7 serotypes (3.8 vs. 3.4 log(10); p = 0.048), NVT (3.6 vs. 3.1 log(10); p = 0.018), H. influenzae (4.34 vs. 3.86 log(10); p = 0.008), M. catarrhalis (3.52 vs. 2.98 log(10) ; p < 0.001) and S. aureus (4.02 vs. 3.06 log(10) ; p = 0.02) was higher among PCV-vaccinated compared to PCV-unvaccinated children at 9 months, although, this difference diminished at 16 months of age.
   Conclusion: The reduction in PCV7-serotype colonization impacted on colonization prevalence and density of other bacterial species of the nasopharynx. The clinical relevance of this needs further exploration in relation to mucosal and invasive disease outcomes, as well as for higher valency PCV vaccines. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: We evaluated antibody persistence up to 68 months (M) post-vaccination with a quadrivalent meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT) or a licensed monovalent MenC conjugate vaccine (MenC-CRM 197 ) and subsequent booster responses to MenACWY-TT in healthy European children.
   Methods: In the initial study (NCT00674583), healthy children, 2-10 years of age, were randomized to receive a single dose of either MenACWY-TT or MenC-CRM 197 . In the follow-up study, we present the persistence at 32, 44, 56, and 68 M post-vaccination, overall and stratified by age (2-5 and 6-10 years), and the immunogenicity and safety of MenACWY-TT administered to all study participants at M68 postprimary vaccination.
   Results: At M68, 33.3% (age group 2-5 years) and 47.1% (age group 6-10 years) of the children vaccinated with MenACWY-TT, and 50.0% (age group 2-5 years) and 75.9% (age group 6-10 years) vaccinated with MenC-CRM 197 retained titers >= 1:8 for MenC, as assessed by a serum bactericidal assay using rabbit complement (rSBA). In the MenACWY-11 recipients, the percentages of children retaining rSBA titers >= 1:8 for MenA, MenW, and MenY were 81.7%, 47.3% and 66.7% in age group 2-5 years and 91.8%, 58,8% and 76.5% in age group 6-10 years, respectively. The booster dose induced robust responses (100% for all serogroups) and was well-tolerated.
   Conclusions: Antibody persistence (rSBA titers >= 1:8) for serogroups A, W and Y was observed in more than 50.0% of the children 68 M after receiving one dose of MenACWY-TT; for MenC, antibody persistence was observed in more than one third of MenACWY-TT and more than half of MenC-CRM 197 recipients. Vaccination with a booster dose of MenACWY-TT induced robust immune responses for all serogroups. (C) 2018 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID VIRUS-INFECTION; POPULATION; COUNTRIES
AB Background/Aims: To evaluate the long-term effect of infant and childhood hepatitis B (HBV) vaccination programs among birthing women in Western Australia.
   Methods: A cohort of Western Australian women born from 1974 to 1995 was created using Birth Registrations and Electoral Roll records. They were linked to a perinatal register and notifiable diseases register to identify women having respectively their first births between 2000 and 2012 and diagnoses of HBV infections. HBV prevalence was estimated in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal women, and according to maternal birth year cohorts.
   Results: Of 66,073 women, 155 (0.23%) had a linked non-acute HBV notification. HBV prevalence was five times higher in Aboriginal women compared to their non-Aboriginal counterparts (0.92%, 95%Cl 0.651.18 versus 0.18%, 0.15-0.21). Among Aboriginal women, after adjusting for year of giving birth and region of residence, those born in the targeted infant and school-based vaccination era (maternal year of birth 1988-1995) had an 89% lower risk (adjusted odds ratio 1a0R10.11, 0.04-0.33) of HBV than those born in the pre-vaccination era (1974-1981). Prevalence also differed between Aboriginal women residing in rural/remote areas compared to those in major cities (aOR 3.06, 1.36-6.88). Among non-Aboriginal women, no significant difference in HBV prevalence was observed by maternal birth cohort (p = 0.20) nor by residence (p = 0.23), but there were significant differences by ethnicity with a 36-fold higher prevalence (aOR 36.08, 22.66-57.46) in non-Caucasian versus Caucasian women.
   Conclusions: A significant decline in HBV prevalence in Aboriginal birthing mothers was observed following the introduction of HBV vaccination programs in Western Australia. There were also considerable disparities in prevalence between women by area of residence and ethnicity. Our findings reflect those observed in women in other Australian jurisdictions. Continued surveillance of HBV prevalence in birthing mothers will provide ongoing estimates of HBV vaccination program impact across Australia and the populations most at risk of chronic HBV.

AB Objectives: To evaluate the 5-year immunogenicity of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (GARDASIL) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
   Methods: Female SLE patients and controls, aged 18-35 years, who received GARDASIL in 2011 and seroconverted 12 months post-vaccination were followed for persistence of immunogenicity. Antibody measurement to HPV serotypes 6, 11, 16, 18 was repeated at 5 years. The rate of sero-reversion was compared between patients and controls, and factors associated with sero-reversion of the anti-HPV antibodies were studied.
   Results: 50 SLE patients and 50 controls were vaccinated with GARDASIL. Among subjects who seroconverted at 1 year and consented for this study, antibodies to HPV serotypes 6, 11, 16 and 18 at 5 years were persistent in 24/27 (89%), 26/31 (84%), 32/34 (94%) and 24/25 (96%) of the SLE patients; and 32/33 (97%), 32/33 (97%), 32/32 (100%) and 23/24 (96%) of the controls, respectively. Antibody titers to HPV-6 and 16 were significantly lower in patients than controls. Seven (21%) SLE patients had sero-reversion of >= 1 anti-HPV antibodies. Sero-reverted patients experienced significantly more SLE flares, particularly renal, and had received significantly higher cumulative doses of prednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus than those with persistent immunogenicity. The cumulative doses of prednisolone correlated inversely and significantly with the anti-HPV 6, 11, and 16 titers at 5 years.
   Conclusions: Immunogenicity of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine was retained in a high proportion of SLE patients at 5 year. Patients with more SLE renal flares and had received more immunosuppression were more likely to have sero-reversion of the anti-HPV antibodies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Monovalent rotavirus (RV) vaccine was introduced in the Philippines in a phased manner beginning in 2012. To assess the impact of RV vaccine, we conducted a retrospective review of diarrheal admissions in two hospitals.
   Methods: Records of physician-diagnosed diarrheal admissions were reviewed in D.O. Plaza Hospital (DOPH) from 2009 to 2016 in Agusan del Sur where RV vaccine was introduced in the immunization program; and in Cotabato Regional Medical Center (CRMC) from 2011 to 2016 in a region where the vaccine was not introduced. Reports from consultations in public health clinics in Agusan Del Sur and RV vaccine coverage were obtained.
   Results: All-cause diarrheal admissions among children <5 years old in DOPH declined from 2013 to 2016 following RV vaccine introduction in 2012. Using the 2009-2011 mean number of hospitalizations as baseline (<(X)over bar>= 1,141), the reductions were 28% (n = 821), 56% (n = 507), 63% (n = 417) and 59% (n = 466) in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. In comparison, no substantial declines in diarrheal hospitalizations were seen in CRMC from 2011 to 2016. A declining trend was also seen in outpatient consultations in Agusan del Sur following RV vaccine introduction with declines of 27% (n = 2,333), 33% (n = 2,143), 45% (n = 1,764) and 67% (n = 1,059) in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. From September 2012 to December 2016, the 1 and 2-dose RV vaccine coverage gradually increased from 5% and 4% in 2012 to 92% and 88% in 2015, but decreased in 2016 to 53% and 52%, respectively.
   Discussion: RV vaccine introduction was associated with a substantial decline in diarrheal hospitalizations and outpatient consultations for diarrhea in Agusan del Sur, Philippines. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Pregnant women are at higher risk for complications from influenza infection. Nevertheless, seasonal influenza vaccination among pregnant women in China is low. A better understanding of perceptions of pregnant women and their physicians, and factors influencing decisions about receiving seasonal influenza vaccine could be used to develop effective strategies for improving seasonal influenza vaccine uptake during pregnancy.
   Methods: We recruited pregnant women from 9 hospitals located in 5 cities across China to participate in focus group interviews. Obstetricians from the same hospitals were recruited for one on one in-depth interviews. We collected information about perceptions of barriers and motivating factors for utilizing seasonal influenza vaccine during pregnancy. We systematically analyzed the information using qualitative methods.
   Results: We conducted 18 focus groups with 108 pregnant women and interviewed 18 obstetricians. Awareness about the use of influenza vaccine during pregnancy was minimal in both subject groups. None of the pregnant women had received influenza vaccine during pregnancy and none of the obstetricians had recommended influenza vaccine for their patients. Both groups noted insufficient knowledge about influenza infection and benefits of the vaccine, concerns about vaccine safety, and lack of local data related to vaccine use in Chinese pregnant women. Obstetricians cited the lack of a national policy as a major barrier to recommending seasonal influenza vaccine to pregnant women. Pregnant women cited not receiving a recommendation for vaccination from healthcare workers as an additional barrier.
   Conclusion: Our findings highlight the immediate need to increase awareness and knowledge about the risks of influenza infection and the benefits and safety of seasonal influenza vaccination among both pregnant women and obstetricians in China. Obstetricians interviewed stated that the development and implementation of a national policy prioritizing pregnant women for seasonal influenza vaccination would facilitate their willingness to recommend seasonal influenza vaccine to pregnant women.

AB Background: Immunization is one of the most successful and effective health intervention to reduce vaccine preventable diseases for children. Recently, Bangladesh has made huge progress in immunization coverage. In this study, we compared the recent immunization coverage between boys and girls in a rural area of Bangladesh.
   Setting: The study is based on data from Chakaria Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) of icddr,b, which covers a population of 90,000 individuals living in 16,000 households in 49 villages.
   Methods: We calculated the coverage of fully immunized children (FIC) for 4584 children aged 12-23 months of age between January 9, 2012 and January 19, 2016. We analyzed immunization coverage using crude FIC coverage ratio (FCR) and adjusted FCR (aFCR) from binary regression models. The dynamic of gender inequality was examined across sociodemographic and economic conditions.
   Main outcome measure: The adjusted female/male (F/M) FIC coverage ratios in various sociodemographic and economic categories.
   Results: Among children who lived below the lower poverty line, the F/M aFCR was 0.89 (0.84-0.94) compared to 0.98 (0.95-1.00) for children from the households above lower poverty line (p = 0.003, test for interaction). For children of mothers with no high school education, the F/M aFCR was 0.94 (0.91-0.97), whereas it was 1.00 (0.96-1.04) for children of mothers who attended high school (p = 0.04, test for interaction). The FPM aFCR was 1.01 (0.96-1.06) for first born children but 0.95 (0.93-0.98) for second or higher birth order children (p = 0.04, test for interaction).
   Conclusions: Fewer girls than boys were completely vaccinated by their first birthday due to girls' lower coverage for measles vaccine. The tendency was most marked for children living below the poverty line, for children whose mothers did not attend high school, and for children of birth order two or higher. In the study setting and similar areas, sex differentials in coverage should be taken into account in ongoing immunization programmes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Liquid vaccine dosage forms have limited stability and require refrigeration during their manufacture, distribution and storage. In contrast, solid vaccine dosage forms, produced by for example spray drying, offer improved storage stability and reduced dependence on cold-chain facilities. This is advantageous for mass immunization campaigns for global public health threats, e.g., tuberculosis (TB), and offers cheaper vaccine distribution. The multistage subunit vaccine antigen H56, which is a fusion protein of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) antigens Ag85B, ESAT-6, and Rv2660, has been shown to confer protective efficacy against active TB before and after Mtb exposure in preclinical models, and it is currently undergoing clinical phase 2a testing. In several studies, including a recent study comparing multiple clinically relevant vaccine adjuvants, the T helper type 1 (Th1)/Thl 7-inducing adjuvant CAF01 was the most efficacious adjuvant for H56 to stimulate protective immunity against Mtb. With the long-term goal of designing a thermostable and self-administrable dry powder vaccine based on H56 and CAF01 for inhalation, we compared H56 spray-dried with CAF01 with the non-spray-dried H56/CAF01 vaccine with respect to their ability to induce systemic Th1, Th17 and humoral responses after subcutaneous immunization. Here we show that spray drying of the H56/CAF01 vaccine results in preserved antigenic epitope recognition and adjuvant activity of CAF01, and the spray-dried, reconstituted vaccine induces antigen-specific Th1, Th17 and humoral immune responses, which are comparable to those stimulated by the non-spray-dried H56/CAF01 vaccine. In addition, the spray-dried and reconstituted H56/CAF01 vaccine promotes similar polyfunctional CD4(+) T-cell responses as the non-spray-dried vaccine. Thus, our study provides proof-of-concept that spray drying of the subunit vaccine H56/CAF01 preserves vaccine-induced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. These results support our ongoing efforts to develop a thermostable, dry powder-based TB vaccine. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A preferred adjuvant should promote both Th1 and Th2 responses. However, most adjuvants in common use are biased towards a Th2-driven response. Therefore, the ability of a novel saponin-based adjuvant G3 to inducing balanced Thl and Th2 responses in BALB/c mice immunized with a split trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine was evaluated in comparison to that of the adjuvant Al(OH) 3 . Clear differences in the IgG profiles induced by G3, Al(OH)(3) or non-adjuvanted vaccine were recorded. Both adjuvants enhanced high and similar levels of the Th2 associated IgG1 subtype compared to mice given vaccine alone. Only G3 enhanced the IgG2a subclass reflecting a Th1 response, whereas Al(OH)(3) even abrogated the IgG2a production. Accordingly, G3 enhanced the production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma and also of IL-2/IFN-gamma double secreting cells, emphasizing the strong Th1 driving effect of G3. Only Al(OH)(3) increased splenocyte production of IL-17. Taken together, the results indicate a strong propensity for G3 to induce both Th1 and Th2 driven immune responses. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Background: The live, attenuated, tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) is licensed in several endemic countries and contraindicated during pregnancy. Inadvertent vaccination during pregnancy may occur during clinical trials that include women of childbearing age. The potential risk associated with dengue vaccination in pregnancy remains unknown. We describe pregnancy outcomes following inadvertent dengue vaccination in pregnancy from CYD-TDV trial data.
   Methods: Data were collected from trials conducted as part of the CYD-TDV clinical development. Women who received CYD-TDV or placebo during the pre-specified pregnancy risk window (from 30 days before the date of their last menstrual period to end of pregnancy) were considered as exposed; pregnancies occurring in non-risk periods during the trials were considered to be non-exposed. Pregnancy losses were defined as abortion (spontaneous or unspecified), death in utero, and stillbirth.
   Results: 615 pregnancies were reported from 19 CYD-TDV trials: 404 in the CYD-TDV arm, and 211 in the placebo arm. Exposure could not be determined for 7 pregnancies (5, CYD-TDV; 2, placebo). In the CYD-TDV arm, 58 pregnancies were considered as exposed. Most of these (n = 47, 81%) had healthy live births; 6 (10.3%) had pregnancy losses; 3 underwent elective termination and 2 had unknown outcome. In the placebo group, 30 pregnancies were considered exposed. Most of these (n = 25, 83%) had healthy births; 4 (13.3%) had pregnancy losses; and 1 had elective termination. Among non-exposed pregnancies, most resulted in healthy live births; 23/341 (6.7%) in the CYD-TDV group and 17/179 (9.5%) in the placebo group had pregnancy losses. Most reported pregnancy losses were in women considered high-risk for adverse pregnancy outcome, primarily due to young age.
   Conclusion: In the small dataset assessed, no evidence of increased adverse pregnancy outcomes has been identified from inadvertent immunization of women in early pregnancy with CYD-TDV compared with the control group. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Seasonal influenza threatens hospitalised patients and residents of nursing homes annually. Due to age and chronic disease their protection following immunisation is diminished. Additional immunisation of direct contacts and in particular healthcare workers (HCWs) has proven added value. As vaccination coverage in HCWs remains low, we aimed to gain insight in the factors behind the demotivation for influenza vaccination.
   Methods: Attitudes and believes towards influenza vaccination and socio-demographic and professional determinants were surveyed in 5141 Belgian HCWs from 13 hospitals and 14 nursing homes. Additionally, influenza campaign coordinators of the participating healthcare institutions were interviewed about the factors of success/failure in their campaigns.
   Results: The mean vaccination coverage registered by the participating healthcare institutions was 40.4% in the hospitals and 45.3% in the nursing homes. Overall, up to 90% of HCWs found it important not to infect their patients. However, only 20% of non-vaccinated HCWs considered influenza vaccination a duty to not harm their patients. Up to 40% of unvaccinated staff believed they could get influenza after vaccination and that vaccination weakens their immune system. Also, only about 20% of unvaccinated staff thought to have a high chance of getting influenza. Reasons for unvaccinated staff to get vaccinated in the future are self-protection and protection of family members. Factors that positively influenced vaccination coverage are encouragement by supervisors (OR, hospitals: 7.1, p <0.001; nursing homes: 7.5, p < 0.001) and well-organized vaccination campaigns with on-site vaccination. Factors that negatively affected vaccination coverage are misconceptions about influenza and its vaccine (OR, range 0.1-0.7, p < 0.001 for most misconceptions) and underestimation of the risk of contracting influenza by patients or HCWs (OR of perceived susceptibility, range 2.1-5.1, p < 0.001 for most factors).
   Conclusion: There is a need for guidance for the organization of seasonal influenza campaigns, in which education, communication and easy accessible vaccination are promoted. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Infection with the dimorphic fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum, occurs world-wide, but North and South America are regions of high endemicity. Interventions to mitigate exposure and consequent disease are limited to remediating a habitat harboring the fungus. The development of a vaccine to prevent infection or lessen its severity is an important advance in disease prevention. Accordingly, we prepared an alkaline extract from the yeast phase of Histoplasma and encased it in glucan particles that act as an adjuvant and delivery vehicle. Immunization of C57BL/6 mice with this encapsulated extract decreased the number of CFUs in lungs and spleens at days 7 and 14 following intranasal infection. Moreover, this vaccine conferred protection against a lethal challenge with the fungus. Cytokine assessment in lungs at a time when the CFUs were similar between controls and vaccinated groups revealed increased quantities of interferon-gamma and interleukin-17 in vaccine recipients. This finding was supported by increased generation of both Th1 and Th17 cells in lungs and draining lymph nodes of vaccinated mice compared to controls. Neutralization of interferon-gamma or interleukin-17 blunted the effectiveness of vaccination. To identify the proteins comprising this extract, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was performed. Thus, an H. capsulatum alkaline extract packaged in glucan particles confers protection in an interferon-gamma and interleukin-17-dependent manner. Discovery of a single protein or a few proteins in this admixture that mediate protective immunity would represent significant progress in efforts to prevent histoplasmosis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Vaccine hesitancy is a considerable issue in European countries and leads to low coverage rates. After a long debate, Italy has made vaccination mandatory for admission to its schools.
   Methods: In the NAVIDAD study (a cross-sectional multicentre study), a 63-item questionnaire was administered to 1820 pregnant women from 15 Italian cities. The questionnaire assessed the interviewee's opinion on mandatory vaccines, as well as their socioeconomic status, sources of information about vaccines, confidence in the Italian National Healthcare Service (NHS), and intention to vaccinate their newborn.
   Results: Information sources play a key role in determining the opinion on restoration of mandatory vaccines; in particular, women who obtained information from anti-vaccination movements are less likely to accept the vaccines (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.21-0.58, p < 0.001). Women who had confidence in healthcare professional information agreed more on mandatory vaccination than did the other women (OR: 2.66, 95% CI: 1.62-4.36, p < 0.001); those who perceived that healthcare professionals have economic interest in child immunization and who declared that healthcare providers inform only on vaccinations benefits not on risks were less likely to agree on compulsory vaccination (OR: 0.66, CI 95%: 0.46-0.96, p = 0.03; OR: 0.66, CI 95%: 0.46-0.95, p = 0.03, respectively).
   Conclusion: Information sources and confidence towards health professionals are the main determinants of acceptance of mandatory vaccine restoration. To increase the acceptability of the restoration and reduce vaccine hesitancy, these aspects need to be strengthened. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Coccidioidomycosis is a systemic fungal infection for which a vaccine has been sought for over fifty years. The avirulent Coccidioides posadasii strain, Delta cps1 which is missing a 6 kb gene, showed significant protection in mice. These studies explore conditions of protection in mice and elucidate the immune response. Mice were vaccinated with different doses and viability states of Delta cps1 spores, challenged with virulent C posadasii, and sacrificed at various endpoints, dependent on experimental objectives. Tissues from vaccinated mice were harvested for in vitro elucidation of immune response. Vaccination with viable Delta cps1 spores was required for protection from lethal challenge. Viable spore vaccination produced durable immunity, lasting at least 6 months, and prolonged survival (>= 6 months). The C. posadasii vaccine strain also protected mice against C immitis (survival >= 6 months). Cytokines from infected lungs of vaccinated mice in the first four days after Cp challenge showed significant increases of IFN-gamma, as did stimulated CD4(+) spleen cells from vaccinated mice. Transfer of CD4(+) cells, but not CD8(+) or B cells, reduced fungal burdens following challenge. IFN-gamma from CD4(+) cells in vaccinated mice indicates a Th1 response, which is critical for host control of coccidioidomycosis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination at age 11-12 years since 2006 for girls and since 2011 for boys. ACIP also recommends vaccination through age 26 for females and through age 21 for males; males may be vaccinated through age 26. We describe vaccine uptake in adolescents and young adults using data from MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters.
   Methods: We analyzed data on persons aged 11-26 years on December 31, 2014 who were continuously enrolled in a MarketScan health plan from age 11 through year 2014, or from 2006 to 2014 if aged >= 11 years in 2006 (916,513 females, 951,082 males). Individuals were grouped based on their age (years) in 2014: 11-12 (born 2002-03), 13-14 (2000-01), 15-16 (1998-99), 17-18 (1996-97), 19-21 (1993-95), and 22-26 (1988-1992). We calculated cumulative coverage with >= 1 HPV vaccine dose by sex, birth cohort, and calendar year.
   Results: In females, the proportion initiating vaccination at age 11-12 years was low in 2008 and 2010 (12.6% and 11.1%) and higher in 2012 (15.7%) and 2014 (19.5%); in males, initiation at age 11-12 was 0.9% in 2010, 8.3% in 2012, and 15.1% in 2014. In females who aged into vaccine eligibility, cumulative coverage by 2014 was higher in older cohorts (17-18: 53%; 15-16: 47%; 13-14: 39%; 11-12: 19.5%). For males, cumulative coverage by 2014 was similar in those aged 13-14, 15-16, and 17-18 years (28.9%, 32.5%, 30.3%), and lower in those aged 11-12 (15.1%), 19-21 (18.4%), and 22-26 years (4.5%).
   Conclusion: The proportion of males and females initiating vaccination at the recommended ages was low. Although more females than males were vaccinated in all cohorts, the male-female differences were smaller in younger than older cohorts. The trajectory of male vaccination uptake could signal higher acceptability in males. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A quantitative analysis of protein phosphorylation in ovine LTL muscle with different color stability was performed in the present study using TMT labeling in combination with TiO2 phosphopeptide enrichment. A total of 3412 phosphopeptides assigned to 1070 phosphoproteins were identified by mass spectrometry, of which 243 proteins were detected to be differentially phosphorylated between muscles of different color stability. Among these differentially phosphorylated proteins, 27 phosphoproteins were identified to be key color-related proteins by informatics analysis. Proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, especially glycolytic enzymes, were the largest cluster of protein determined to be color-related. In addition, the phosphorylation of myoglobin at Ser133 plays a negative role in the regulation of meat color stability. In summary, this study revealed that the phosphorylation of some glycolytic enzymes and myoglobin at specific serine residues may play critical roles in the regulation of meat color stability.

AB This study was designated to ascertain the effectiveness of polylactic acid (PLA) based packaging solution to store red fresh meat during its refrigerated shelf-life. Recently the attention in the packaging industry regarding the use of bioplastics has been shifting from compostable/biodegradable materials toward biobased materials. Steaks obtained from semimembranous muscle of Piemontese beef were packaged in PLA trays closed with a lid made of PLA film and for comparison purposed in a conventional reference package consisting of a amorphous polyethylene terephthalate/polyethylene (APET/PET) trays and wrapped in plastic film of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The packaging under modified atmosphere MAP was carried out by using a gas mixture of 66% O-2, 25% CO2 and 9%N-2. By using PLA packaging combination it was possible to maintain an optimum red colour together with a reduced content of volatile compounds associated to off-flavours of meat samples particularly related to the oxidation phenomena.

AB Determination of heavy metals at trace levels has a great deal of importance due to their undesirable effects on human life. In this study, N,N'-bis (acetyl acetone) ethylenediimine (Fe3O4@SiO2-EDN) was synthesized and applied for dispersive solid phase extraction of copper in water and cereal samples followed by FAAS. Sorbent characterization was investigated by SEM, FT-IR, EDX and VSM. The effective parameters were optimized using a central composite design. Under the optimal conditions, LOD (S/N = 3) and LOQ, preconcentration factor and RSD% were found to be 1.5 ng mL(-1), 4.0 ng mL(-1), 13 and 2.3%, respectively. The calibration curve was linear within the range of 4.0-175 ng mL(-1) with r(2) > 0.998. Relative recoveries were achieved within the range of 90.0-95.0%. With thanks of the good resulting analytical performance in this work, the proposed method can be applied as a suitable alternative for trace analysis of copper.

AB Among cereals, rice is the second most cultivated staple crop in the world. It may be contaminated by toxic heavy metals present in water or soil. Therefore, monitoring the presence of heavy metals in rice and its products is a matter of a great importance from the nutritional and toxicological view. In this paper, a simple and effective analytical procedure based on dispersive micro solid-phase extraction with the use of oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes and batophenanthroline was developed for the determination of lead, cadmium, zinc, manganese and iron in white and wild rice samples. Due to the high preconcentration factor of 200, the optimized procedure allows obtaining detection limits between 0.13 and 0.35 ng mL(-1) using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). Novel preconcentration method can successfully be applied in food analysis with accuracy better than 7% rel. and repeatability lower than 3%.

AB This paper describes an aptamer/gold nanoparticle-based assay for ochratoxin A (OTA) detection. This assay is based on the use of an aptamer labeled with carboxyfluorescein (FAM) at its 5'-end and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) that act as quenchers of fluorescence. When OTA is absent in the system, the fluorescently labeled aptamers are adsorbed on the surface of AuNPs. The fluorescence signal of the fluorescein-labeled OTA aptamer generated is quenched by the fluorescence resonance energy transfer effect of AuNPs. When OTA is present in the system, the fluorescently labeled aptamer binds to OTA and forms a folded structure, which can resist the adsorption of AuNPs. Thus, the fluorescent signal can be retained. The detection limit of this sensing platform is 5 nM, and the linear detection range is 10-1000 nM (R-2 = 0.994). The procedure was validated by the quantitation of OTA in spiked ginger powder samples and were found to be free of interference by the sample matrix. The recoveries and the relative standard deviation varied from 89.0% to 117.8% and from 1.9% to 6.3%, respectively.

AB A rapid method for producing 9Z- and 13'Z-isomers from all-E-lutein was developed using I-TiO2 as catalyst. In a simulated in vitro gastrointestinal digestion model, both trans-cis isomerization of all-E-lutein and cis-trans isomerization of Z-luteins occurred during the intestinal phase. The bioaccessibility of all isomers was between 14 and 23%, and it was higher for Z-luteins. In a Caco-2 cell monolayer model, all isomers were relatively stable during cellular uptake and transport across the membrane as no significant isomerization and degradation was detected, but all-E-lutein exhibited significantly higher cellular uptake and transport efficiencies. These results suggest that Z-luteins found in human plasma may likely be formed before intestinal absorption. 13'Z-Lutein also exhibited highest antioxidant activity in FRAP, DPPH and ORAC-L assays, but no significant difference in cell-based antioxidant assay compared with other isomers. Future studies on the different antioxidant activities of cis isomers of lutein in vivo will provide further explanation.

The matrix components influenced the measurement of the pesticides by the developed analysis technique, so that, analytical curves were prepared using pesticide-free matrix extracts for quantification of the analytes. The method provides satisfactory accuracy verified by recoveries of 70-120%, and good precision (coefficients of variation = 20%). It also showed selectivity, linearity of response, and lower limits of quantification than the maximum limit of residue for each compound, as established by ANVISA and Codex Alimentarius.

AB A sensitive and reliable method for determining the total avilamycin residues was developed using LC-MS/MS. Avilamycin (consisting of avilamycin A and 15 other minor factors) and its metabolites in porcine muscle, fat, and liver were analysed as the marker residue dichloroisoeverninic acid (DIA), in accordance with the maximum residue limit (MRL) established by international organisations such as Codex Alimentarius Commission and other regulatory bodies. The analytes were extracted from samples with acetone, hydrolysed to DIA, partitioned into ethyl acetate, and cleaned up prior to the LC-MS/MS analysis. The method was validated at Codex MRL and 0.01 mg/kg. The results show excellent recoveries ranging from 100 to 108%, with the relative standard deviations < 6%. Matrix effects were negligible for all types of samples, indicating effective sample clean-up. The absence of interfering peaks close to the retention time in blank samples demonstrates high selectivity. Overall, this method is reliable and suitable for regulatory-purpose analysis.

AB Colorimetric aptasensors were designed for detection of tobramycin (TOB) based on unmodified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and single-strand DNA (ssDNA). In the absence of TOB, the DNA aptamer was coated on the surface of AuNPs to keep it against salt-induced aggregation. In the presence of TOB, aptamer will bind with TOB and detach from the surface of AuNPs because of higher affinities between aptamer and TOB. Then less protection of DNA may result in the aggregation of AuNPs by salt and an apparent color change from red to purpleblue. The developed aptasensors showed a high selectivity and sensitivity for TOB detection. The linearity range and the detection limit were 40-200 nM and 23.3 nM respectively. The validity of the procedure and applicability of aptasensors were successfully used to detect TOB in milk and chicken eggs, and the results were excellent in accord with the values obtained by spectrofluorimetric detection.

AB We studied the kinetics of peptide release during the gastric digestion of meat proteins in vivo, in view to predicting the release of bioactive peptides further on in the digestive tract. Six mini pigs fitted with gastric cannulas received a meal with cooked beef as protein source. Digesta was collected at regular time intervals up to 5 1/2 h. The peptides generated by the gastric digestion of meat were identified and quantified using label-free LC MS, thereafter subjected to in silico digestion mimicking the action of intestinal enzymes. Three clusters of proteins presenting similar evolutions according to their dynamic hydrolysis were obtained. This study clearly improves the in silico prediction of the intestinal release of bioactive peptides by mapping meat protein degradation in the stomach in an in vivo model. Knowledge of the conformation of the peptides released in the stomach further improves this prediction.

AB Water-soluble polysaccharides (RTFP) were extracted from Rosa roxburghii Tratt fruit by hot water method. The physicochemical, functional, and hypoglycemic properties of RTFP were investigated. The results revealed that RTFP mainly contained carbohydrates (63.79 +/- 0.73%, g/g), uronic acids (14.8 +/- 0.06%, g/g), and proteins (4.10 +/- 0.58%, g/g). RTFP was composed of arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose, xylose, and fucose with molar percentages of 33.8, 37.3, 20.7, 1.74, 3.43, and 2.95%, respectively. Functional analyses indicated that RTFP had good oil-holding capacity, foaming properties, and emulsifying capacity. The rheological results showed that RTFP exhibited typical shear-thinning behavior and viscoelastic properties influenced by sample concentration, temperature and inorganic salt. Additionally, RTFP exhibited favorable inhibitory activities against alpha-glucosidase in a mixed inhibition type, and against alpha-amylase in an uncompetitive inhibition type. These results suggest that RTFP can be exploited as a multi-functional additive or hypoglycemic agent in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.

AB The use of coffee leaves as a novel beverage has recently received consumer interest, but there is little known about how processing methods affect the quality of final product. We applied tea (white, green, oolong and black tea) processing methods to process coffee leaves and then investigated their effects on phytochemical composition and related antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Using Japanese-style green tea-processing of young leaves, and black tea-processing of mature (BTP-M) coffee leaves, produced contrasting effects on phenolic content, and associated antioxidant activity and nitric oxide (NO) inhibitory activity in IFN-gamma. and LPS induced Raw 264.7 cells. BTP-M coffee leaves also had significantly (P < .05) higher responses in NO, iNOS, COX-2, as well as a number of cytokines, in non-induced Raw 264.7. Our findings show that the age of coffee leaves and the type of processing method affect phytochemical profiles sufficiently to produce characteristic antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.

AB Polymeric tannins from grapes have always been reported as an unresolved broad peak in HPLC chromatograms, and this has severely limited their identification to date. This study aimed to disassemble this broad peak and explore the polymeric tannin molecules inside. By applying centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC), an efficient separation approach was developed to split the broad peak of grape seed tannins into fractions. Then, the fractions were analyzed by Q-ToF (quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry) to determine the corresponding structures of the tannins. The results suggest that grape seed polymeric tannins were eluted consecutively according to their degree of polymerization (DP). Condensed tannins identified in wine grape seed have a range of DP and degree of galloylation (DG) up to 20 and 11, respectively. The molecular mass of the largest molecule detected was 6067. To our knowledge, this is the first report to offer an insight into the broad peak of polymeric tannins found with HPLC and to characterize the tannins with a DP up to 20 as shown by HRMS and MS/MS data.

AB Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has been reported to reduce fat storage in cell culture and animal models. In the current study, the effects of CLA on the fat accumulation, activities, and proteomics were investigated using Caenorhabditis elegans. 100 mu M CLA-TG nanoemulsion significantly reduced fat accumulation by 29% compared to linoleic acid (LA)-TG treatment via sir-2.1 (the ortholog of Sirtuin 1), without altering the worm size, growth rate, and pumping rate of C. elegans. CLA significantly increased moving speed and amplitude (the average centroid displacement over the entire track) of wild type worms compared to the LA group and these effects were dependent on aak-2 (AMPKa ortholog) and sir-2.1. Proteomics analysis showed CLA treatment influences various proteins associated in reproduction and development, translation, metabolic processes, and catabolism and proteolysis, in C. elegans. We have also confirmed the proteomics data that CLA reduced the fat accumulation via abs-1 (ATP Synthase B homolog). However, there were no significant effects of CLA on brood size, progeny numbers, and hatchability compared to LA treatment.

AB Cloud loss, enzymatic browning, and flavor changes are important quality defects of cloudy fruit juices determining consumer acceptability. The development of clean label options to overcome such quality problems is currently of high interest. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of kiwifruit puree (clean label ingredient) and high pressure homogenization on quality changes of cloudy apple juice using a multivariate approach. The use of kiwifruit puree addition and high pressure homogenization resulted in a juice with improved uniformity and cloud stability by reducing particle size and increasing viscosity and yield stress (p < 0.01). Furthermore, kiwifruit puree addition reduced enzymatic browning (triangle E* < 3), due to the increased ascorbic acid and contributed to a more saturated and bright yellow color, a better taste balance, and a more fruity aroma of juice. This work demonstrates that clean label options to control quality degradation of cloudy fruit juice might offer new opportunities.

AB The effect of the structure and composition of acylglycerol emulsifiers on the functionality of a palm-based shortening and quality of layer cake was investigated. The emulsifiers evaluated were distilled monoacylglycerol (DMG) and four acylglycerols (40% monoacylglycerol content) of octanoic acid (8: 0), palmitic acid (16: 0), stearic acid (18: 0), and linoleic acid (18: 2), designated as GMOct40, GMP40, GMS40, and GML40, respectively. The addition of GMP40 and GMS40 led to shortening with a higher solid fat content, finer crystals, and higher proportion of beta' form. These changes enhanced shortening's function in aiding air incorporation and retention in cake batter, which improved the cake's volume and crumb structure. However, the high monoacylglycerol content in DMG did not improve the properties of shortening and cake as compared to GMP40. In contrast, GML40 and GMOct40 had adverse effects on the functionality of shortening, which generated cakes with inferior crumb structure.

AB Artemisia sphaerocephala, a dicotyledonous perennial semi-shrub belonging to the Artemisia genus of the Compositae family, is widely distributed in northwestern China. This shrub is one of the most important pioneer plants which is capable of protecting rangelands from wind erosion. It therefore plays a vital role in maintaining desert ecosystem stability. In addition, to its use as a forage grass, it has excellent prospective applications as a source of plant oil and as a plant-based fuel. The use of internal genes is the basis for accurately assessing Real time quantitative PCR. In this study, based on transcriptome data of A. sphaerocephala, we analyzed 21 candidate internal genes to determine the optimal internal genes in this shrub. The stabilities of candidate genes were evaluated in 16 samples of A. sphaerocephala. Finally, UBC9 and TIP41-like were determined as the optimal reference genes in A. sphaerocephala by Delta Ct and three various programs. There were GeNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper.

AB Objective: Investigate the association between P2Y12 Purinoceptor (P2RY12) polymorphisms and adverse clinical events in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients treated with clopidogrel.
   Methods: We performed a comprehensive database search, with a particular focus on P2RY12 polymorphisms and their effects on clopidogrel-treated CAD patients, in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, clinicaltrials. gov, Web of Science, and Chinese databases from their inceptions to April 8, 2017. The primary endpoints were composite ischemic events (including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular ischemic events), the secondary endpoints were independent cardiovascular events (mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, unstable angina, and target vessel revascularization) and the safety endpoints were bleeding events.
   Results: Overall 10 studies and 10,810 clopidogrel-treated CAD patients were studied in the present work. Subjects of the common alleles of P2RY12 polymorphisms showed higher risk for composite ischemic events compared to non-carriers (n = 434 of 3268[13.3%] vs. n = 646 of 6133[10.5%]; RR: 1.39, 95%CI: 1.14-1.69; p = 0.001). These allele carriers also showed increased risk for stent thrombosis (RR: 2.67, 95%CI: 1.03-6.91; p = 0.04), myocardial infarction (RR: 1.60, 95%CI: 1.06-2.42; p = 0.03), and unstable angina (RR: 1.72, 95%CI: 1.37-2.16; p < 0.00001) (vs. non-carriers). There was no significant difference between two groups in terms of mortality risk, target vessel revascularization or bleeding (p = 0.29; p = 0.48, respectively).
   Conclusions: P2RY12 gene polymorphisms might associate with higher risk of composite ischemic events, stent thrombosis, non-fatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina. While we found no significant effect on mortality, target vessel revascularization or bleeding.

AB Purpose: The heavy subunit of the iron storage protein ferritin (FHC) is essential for the intracellular iron metabolism and, at the same time, it represents a central hub of iron-independent pathways, such as cell proliferation, angiogenesis, p53 regulation, chemokine signalling, stem cell expansion, miRNAs expression. In this work we have explored the ability of FHC to modulate gene expression in K562 cells, through the up-regulation of the lncRNA H19 and its cognate miR-675.
   Materials and methods: Targeted silencing of FHC was performed by lentiviral-driven shRNA strategy. FHC reconstitution was obtained by full length FHC cDNA transfection with Lipofectamine 2000. ROS amounts were determined with the redox-sensitive probe H2DCFDA. H19, miR-675, miR-107, Twist1, ID3, EPHB6, GNS, ANK1 and SMAD6 mRNA amounts were quantified by Taqman assay and qPCR analysis.
   Results: FHC silencing in K562 cells modulates gene expression through the up-regulation of the lncRNA H19 and its cognate miR-675. Experimental findings demonstrate that the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is represented by an FHC knock-down-triggered increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.
   Conclusions: In this paper we uncover a so far not described function of the ferritin heavy subunit in the control of lncRNA pathways.

AB This study aims to construct and evaluate RGD-decorated chitosan (CS)-functionalized pH-responsive singlewalled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) carriers using docetaxel (DTX) as a model anticancer drug. DTX was loaded onto SWCNT via pi-pi stacking interaction (SWCNT-DTX), followed by the non-covalent conjugation of RGD-decorated CS to SWCNT-DTX to prepare RGD-CS-SWCNT-DTX. The RGD-CS-SWCNT-DTX showed significantly higher drug release than the pure drug, giving higher release rate at pH 5.0 (68%) than pH 7.4 (49%). The RGDCS-SWCNT-DTX could significantly inhibit the growth of A549 tumor cells in vitro, and the uptake amount of A549 cells was obviously higher than that of MCF-7 cells. Meanwhile, the cellular uptake of RGD-CS-SWCNTDTX was higher than that of CS-SWCNT-DTX in A549 cells, mainly through clathrin and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. The RGD-CS-SWCNT-DTX significantly inhibited tumor growth of A549 cell-bearing nude mice through active tumor-targeting ability. Furthermore, no pathological changes were found in tissues and organs. The result demonstrated that RGD-CS-SWCNT-DTX displayed high drug loading, pH-responsive drug release, remarkable antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo, and also good safety to animal body.

AB The complex nasal structure poses obstacles for efficient nasal drug administration beyond the nasal valve, especially when targeting the olfactory region. This study numerically detailed the naturally inhaled nanoparticle transport process from the initial releasing locations to the final deposited sites using a realistic human nasal passage. Dispersed nanoparticles at different coronal cross-sections were partitioned into multiple groups according to their final deposited locations. Results showed inhaled nanoparticles are more likely to move along the septum. Olfactory deposited particles entered the nose through the inner superior corner of the nostril; the middle meatus deposited particles entered the nose through the top third of the nostril; the inferior deposited particles entered via the bottom floor regions of the nostril. Therefore, targeted nasal inhalation therapies that intentionally release therapeutic particles from these recognized regions at the nostril plane can considerably improve the resultant topical disposition doses. However, it remains challenging to completely prevent undesired particle depositions as particles coming from the same location may produce multiple-sites depositions due to partition overlapping. Nevertheless, the fraction of undesired particle deposition is anticipated to be reduced at a great extent compared to unplanned releasing approaches.

AB The present study aims at the development of cholesterol based lipopolymeric nanoparticles for improved entrapment, better cell penetration and improved pharmacokinetics of Tamoxifen (TMX). Self-assembling cholesterol grafted lipopolymer, mPEG-b-(CB-{g-chol}-co-LA) was synthesized from poly(ethyleneglycol)-block-2methyl-2-carboxyl-propylenecarboxylic acid-co-poly (L-lactide) [mPEG-b-(CB-{g-COOH}-co-LA)] copolymer followed by carbodiimide coupling for attaching cholesterol. Lipopolymeric nanoparticles were prepared using o/w solvent evaporation technique, which were subsequently characterized to determine its particle size, entrapment efficiency, release pattern and compared with mPEG-PLA nanoparticles. Further, in order to assess the in vitro efficacy, cytotoxicity studies, uptake, apoptosis assay and cell cycle analysis were performed in breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and 4T1). Finally, the pharmacokinetic profile of TMX loaded mPEG-b-(CB-{g-chol}-coLA) lipopolymeric nanoparticles was also performed. TMX loaded lipopolymeric nanoparticles of particle size 151.25 +/- 3.74 (PDI 0.123) and entrapment efficiency of 73.62 +/- 3.08% were formulated. The haemolytic index, protein binding and in vitro drug release of the optimized nanoparticles were found to be comparable to that of the TMX loaded mPEG-PLA nanoparticles. Lipopolymeric nanoparticles demonstrated improved IC50 values in breast cancer cells (22.2 mu M in 4T1; 18.8 pM in MCF-7) than free TMX (27.6 mu M and 23.5 mu M respectively) and higher uptake efficiency. At IC50 values, TMX loaded lipopolymeric nanoparticles induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (G(0)/G(1) phase) to similar extent as that of free drug. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated similar to 2.5-fold increase in the half-life (t(1/2)) (p < 0.001) and similar to 2.7-fold (p < 0.001) increase in the mean residence time (MRT) of TMX following incorporation into lipopolymeric nanoparticles. Thus, mPEG-b-(CB-{gchol}-co-LA) lipopolymeric nanoparticles offer a more promising approach for delivery of Tamoxifen in breast cancer by improving drug internalization and prolonging the mean residence time of the drug indicating possibility of dose reduction and hence bypassing the adverse effects of TMX therapy.

AB In the XXI century diabetes mellitus has become one of the main threats to human health with higher incidence in regions such as Europe and North America. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) occurs as a consequence of the immune-mediated destruction of insulin producing beta-cells located in the endocrine part of the pancreas, the islets of Langerhans. The administration of exogenous insulin through daily injections is the most prominent treatment for T1DM but its administration is frequently associated to failure in glucose metabolism control, finally leading to hyperglycemia episodes. Other approaches have been developed in the past decades, such as whole pancreas and islet allotransplantation, but they are restricted to patients who exhibit frequent episodes of hypoglycemia or renal failure because the lack of donors and islet survival. Moreover, patients transplanted with either whole pancreas or islets require of immune suppression to avoid the rejection of the transplant. Currently, advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP), such as implantable devices, have been developed in order to reduce immune rejection response while increasing cell survival. To overcome these issues, ATMPs must promote vascularization, guaranteeing the nutritional contribution, while providing O-2 until vasculature can surround the device. Moreover, it should help in the immune-protection to avoid acute and chronic rejection. The transplanted cells or islets should be embedded within biomaterials with tunable properties like injectability, stiffness and porosity mimicking natural ECM structural characteristics. And finally, an infinitive cell source that solves the donor scarcity should be found such as insulin producing cells derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Several companies have registered their ATMPs and future studies envision new prototypes. In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms and etiology of diabetes, comparing the clinical trials in the last decades in order to define the main characteristics for future ATMPs.

AB Nevirapine (NVP) is recommended by WHO as the antiretroviral treatment to prevent HIV passing from mother to child. However, the once-daily oral administration results in poor patient compliance, and a long-acting injectable form of NVP is desirable. Using single-crystal X-ray diffraction and other characterization methods, we demonstrated NVP can form crystalline inclusion complex (IC) with the biodegradable hydrophobic poly(ecaprolactone) (PCL), and investigated the potential of the NVP-PCL IC microparticles as a long-acting injectable solid form. Compared with pure NVP crystals and NVP/polylactide microparticles, the NVP-PCL IC crystals showed significantly decreased solubility and slower dissolution rate, making it more suitable to be developed to achieve sustained-release profiles. In addition, the NVP-PCL IC microparticles with an average diameter below 10 mu m be conveniently prepared by spray drying and are found to be easily injectable through a 25G needle. These results demonstrated the possibility of using drug-polymer IC microparticles as long-acting injectable forms, providing a new approach to design sustained-release drug products.

AB The synthesis of nano-size drug particles by antisolvent crystallization using a porous hollow fiber membrane provides promising benefits such as the capability of continuous operation, low energy input, and ease of scaleup for a variety of industrial processes. Porous hollow fiber membranes have also been shown to produce more efficient mixing than conventional mixing equipment mostly because in mixing binary fluids, they provide sufficient mixing time, retention time, and a large contact interface for the drug solution and the antisolvent, allowing for the precise control of nucleation and crystal growth necessary to form nano-size particles.
   This study reports an experimental and numerical approach to obtain a further understanding of the fundamental principles of antisolvent crystallization using a porous hollow fiber membrane. This includes producing a particle size-controlled drug nanosuspension experimentally using a commercial microfiltration (MF) pencil scale module, and a numerical analysis of mixing behavior using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. From the results obtained, a nanosuspension of a model drug, Indomethacin, with particles of average diameter 0.320 mu m was prepared. Furthermore, this nanosuspension has higher stability and a much lower tendency to agglomerate as compared to simple mixing of the anti-solvent and drug solution. Results from the numerical simulation showed that micromixing is possible using the porous hollow fiber membrane even under the most compromising conditions.

AB In order to search for new approaches to treat glioma, intranasal administration has been proposed as an alternative route to deliver drugs into the brain. Among the drug alternatives, kaempferol (KPF) has been reported to induce glioma cell death. This study aimed to prepare nanoemulsions containing KPF with and without chitosan to investigate their potential for brain delivery following intranasal administration, and to evaluate their antitumor activity against glioma cells. KPF-loaded nanoemulsion (KPF-NE) and KPF-loaded mucoadhesive nanoemulsion (KPF-MNE) were prepared by high-pressure homogenization technique and were characterized for their globule size, zeta potential, drug content, pH, viscosity, mucoadhesive strength and morphology. KPF from KPF-MNE showed significantly higher permeation across the mucosa in ex vivo diffusion studies. Histopathological examination suggests both nanoemulsions to be safe for the nasal mucosa and able to preserve KPF antioxidant capability. KPF-MNE enhanced significantly the amount of drug into rat's brain following intranasal administration (5- and 4.5-fold higher than free drug and KPF-NE, respectively). In addition, KPF-MNE reduced C6 glioma cell viability through induction of apoptosis to a greater extent than either free KPF or KPFNE. The mucoadhesive nanoemulsion developed for intranasal administration may be a promising system for delivery to the brain, and KPF-MNE is a candidate for further antiglioma trials.

AB Nimodipine may be of interest to treat behavioral alterations and memory deficits. However, its oral administration is hampered by a low bioavailability. The aim of this work was to develop pegylated nanoparticles as oral carriers of nimodipine and test their capability to both reverse the anxiety and protect against cognitive impairment of in stressed mice. Pegylated nanoparticles (NMD-NP/PEG), with a size of 190 nm and a payload of 68 mu g/mg, significantly improve the oral bioavailability of nimodipine; about 7-times higher than for the control drug solution (62% vs 9%). The effect of oral nimodipine on the anxiety and cognitive capabilities in a model of stressed mice was also evaluated. NMD-NP/PEG displayed a poor effect on the anxiety-like behavior of animals. Nevertheless, only the treatment with NMD-NP/PEG exerted a protective effect against the memory impairments induced by chronic corticosterone administration, improving the cognitive capabilities of animals when compared with controls. These pegylated nanocarriers may represent a useful strategy to develop new oral treatments for preventing from cognitive impairments.
