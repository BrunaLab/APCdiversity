AB This study focused on a culture system of aerial microalgae with the decomposition of casein protein for obtaining bioactive compounds such as peptides with inhibitory activity against angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). The aerial microalga Vischeria helvetica exhibited growth in Bold's basal medium supplemented with casein protein as nitrogen source. The algal cells secreted protease and amino oxidase into the medium, and ammonium ions as a nitrogen source was produced by the conjugated-enzyme reaction. Furthermore, a bioactive peptide with ACE-inhibitory activity was efficiently produced from casein protein by the proteases secreted under light conditions. The results presented will facilitate the development of production systems for useful materials from photosynthetic microorganisms and casein protein in a culture medium.

AB beta-glucosidases are glycoside hydrolases that-particularly those from filamentous fungi-have been extensively explored in cellulose fiber saccharification and wine quality improvement. However, these enzymes from yeast have been poorly studied. In this study, an ethanol-glucose tolerant beta-glucosidase that is secreted by Pichia guilliermondii (current name Meyerozyma guilliermondii) was purified and characterized. This enzyme exhibited an estimated molecular mass of 97 kDa and the highest activity between pH 3.5-5.5 and 55 degrees C. The beta-glucosidase was also tolerant to acetone, ethanol, isopropanol, and methanol up to 30% and glucose at 1 M. It was also stable up to 55 degrees C for 80 min, maintaining 70% of its initial activity and in a wide pH range (pH 3-10). The enzyme exhibited 90-100% of its initial activity for 72 h at 20, 25, and 30 degrees C in presence of 10% ethanol at pH 3.5, which is a similar condition to winemaking. Studies that identify new enzymes and describe their purification are required for oenology applications. The beta-glucosidase described herein is a promising candidate for use in the preparation of wine. Additionally, its tolerance to glucose is an important biochemical property that adds value to this enzyme and enables it to be used during the final saccharification process.

AB Microbial consortia, which degrade branched, long-chain hydrocarbons, can be regarded as a promising source of novel enzymes for the stereo-and regio-selective oxyfunctionalization of hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbon-degrading bacterium Pimelobacter sp. Bb-B was isolated from the consortium associated with the colonial hydrocarbon- excreting microalga Botryococcus braunii. Three new type II flavoprotein monooxygenases (type II FMOs) from this bacterium have been made available in recombinant form through cloning and overexpression in an E. coli host organism. These enzymes (PsFMO_ A-C) were characterized in terms of their capability of catalyzing Baeyer-Villiger oxidations with distinct substrates. The highest activity was detected when utilizing camphor and bicyclo[3.2.0] hept-2-en-6-one as substrate in combination with PsFMO_ A as the most promising enzyme. Furthermore, synthetic biotransformations with 5mM of the substrate bicyclo[3.2.0] hept-2-en-6-one, formate and formate dehydrogenase for in situ-cofactor recycling were conducted with this enzyme, leading to a substrate consumption of 85% after 66 h and excellent enantioselectivity of 99% ee for the (1R, 5S)-enantiomer. Additionally, an alternative in situ-cofactor recycling based on the use of microalgae for in situ-production of formate from carbon dioxide, water and light together with a formate dehydrogenase was combined successfully with the enzyme PsFMO_ A, leading to a substrate consumption of 94% and an enantioselectivity of >99% ee for the so-called "normal lactone"-enantiomer with the absolute configuration 1R, 5S.

AB Given the multifactorial state of autoimmune complex diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), it is not clear if different risk factors act jointly or independently. Despite intensive studies investigating multi aspects of MS risk factors, findings with regards to potential biomarkers that may link these risk factors remained largely inconclusive.
   System biology or data integration utilizes different validated datasets to extract meaningful information and map the plausible biological pathways and networks. As such, we integrated eight transcriptome datasets to find the differentially expressed miRNAs in peripheral blood (PB) between relapsing remitting MS patients (RAMS) and normal group. After identification the targeted genes of miRNAs, the hub genes were used to construct the underlying protein protein interaction network and signaling pathways.
   As results, 9 miRNAs were best exemplified by significant dysregulation including hsa-mir-15a, hsa-mir-484, hsa-mir-30d, hsa-mir-145, hsa-mir-363, has-let-7e, hsa-mir-30a, hsa-let-7b, and hsa-mir-146a. System biology analysis of miRNAs in PB of RRMS patients clearly indicates the involvement of miRNAs in many vital pathways and highlighted the possibility of an association between miRNAs with EBV and vitamin D in MS pathogenesis.
   Described novel pathways and genes related to miRNAs such as Transient receptor potential channels and Acid sphingomyelinase may provide a potential target for therapeutic approaches although further functional studies are warranted to test these candidates.

AB Most cancer cells predominantly produce their energy through a high rate of glycolysis in the presence of abundant oxygen. Glycolysis has become a target of anticancer strategies. Previous researches showed that glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) inhibitor is effective as anticancer agents. This study assessed the effects of the selective GLUT1 inhibitor WZB117 on regulation of neuroblastoma (NB) cell line SH-SY5Y viability, cell cycle and glycolysis in vitro. SH-SY5Y cells were grown and treated with WZB117 for up to 72 h and then subjected to cell viability, qRT-PCR, Western blot and flow cytometry analysis. Level of ATP and LDH was also analyzed. The result showed that WZB117 treatment reduced tumor cells viability, downregulated level of GLUT1 protein. Moreover, WZB117 treatment arrested tumor cells at the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle, induced tumor cells to undergo necrosis instead of apoptosis. In addition, WZB117 treatment downregulated the levels of intracellular ATP, LDH and glycolytic enzymes. Thus, WZB117-induced GLUT1 inhibition suppressed tumor cell growth, induced cell cycle arrest and reduced glycolysis metabolites in NB cells in vitro. This study suggested that GLUT1 can be used as a potential therapeutic target for NB.

AB Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents. Aberrant expression of HOXA5 results in various diseases, including cancers. However, the specific function and molecular mechanism of HOXA5 in osteosarcoma is not fully understood. In the present study, we focused on HOXA5 in U2OS and MG63 cells in vitro. We observed lower expression of HOXA5 in U2OS, MG63, and SaOS2 human osteosarcoma cells, compared with hFOB1.19 human osteoblastic cells. HOXA5 overexpression in U2OS and MG63 cells markedly reduced cell survival and proliferation and elevated cell apoptosis and caspase-3 activity. HOXA5 also activated the p38 alpha MAPK pathway by increasing p53. Treating U2OS and MG63 cells with the p53 inhibitor alpha-pifithan or the p38 alpha MAPK inhibitor SB203580 led to higher cell survival and proliferation and lower cell apoptosis, compared with the pcDNA3.1-HOXA5 group. In conclusion, our study showed that the p53 and p38 alpha MAPK signal axis facilitated HOXA5's role in inhibiting growth and stimulating apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells.

AB Aims: The previous studies on ABCG1 using genetically modified mice showed inconsistent results on atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether accurate target knockout of ABCG1 would result in transcriptional changes of other atherosclerosis-related genes.
   Methods: ABCG1 knockout mouse model was obtained by precise gene targeting without affecting non-target DNA sequences in C57BL/6 background. The wildtype C57BL/6 mice were regarded as control group. 12-week-old male mice were used in current study. We performed whole transcriptome analysis on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from ABCG1 knockout mice (n = 3) and their wildtype controls (n = 3) by RNA-seq.
   Results: Compared with wildtype group, 605 genes were modified at the time of ABCG1 knockout and expressed differentially in knockout group, including 306 up-regulated genes and 299 down-regulated genes. 54 genes were associated with metabolism regulation, of which 13 were related to lipid metabolism. We also found some other modified genes in knockout mice involved in cell adhesion, leukocyte transendothelial migration and apoptosis, which might also play roles in the process of atherosclerosis. 7 significantly enriched GO terms and 19 significantly enriched KEGG pathways were identified, involving fatty acid biosynthesis, immune response and intracellular signal transduction.
   Conclusions: ABCG1 knockout mice exhibited an altered expression of multiple genes related to many aspects of atherosclerosis, which might affect the further studies to insight into the effect of ABCG1 on atherosclerosis with this animal model.

AB Clinical Exome Sequencing (CES) has increasingly become a popular diagnostic tool in patients suffering from genetic disorders that are clinically and genetically complicated. Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs) is an example of a heterogeneous disorder. In Qatar, familial cases of MPNs are more frequently seen than described in the literature. In this study, we aimed to use CES to classify six Qatari subjects that were suspected of clinical diagnosis of MPNs, according to the WHO 2008 diagnostic criteria for hematologic malignancies, and identify variants that can potentially explain the phenotypic diversity of MPNs. We sequenced six Qatari subjects using CES, of whom, three probands were unrelated families and three members were from the same family, all probands come from consanguineous families, and had a positive family history of MPNs. CES identified 61 variants in 50 genes; of which, 13 were recurrently mutated in our patients. Ten novel variants were identified in ten known genes related to MPNs and seven variants were identified in seven novel candidate genes. The genotype of the six subjects was due to a combination of different variants in different genes. This study serves as a pilot study to investigate the complexity of the genotype of patients with MPNS in Qatar, and serves as a guide for further well-controlled genetic epidemiological studies for patients with MPNs. CES is a powerful tool to be used in the genetic clinics for differential and definitive diagnosis of patients with MPNs.

AB Atmospheric CO2 level is one of the most important factors which affect plant growth and crop production. Although many crucial genes and pathways have been identified in response to atmospheric CO2 changes, the integrated and precise mechanisms of plant CO2 response are not well understood. Alternative splicing (AS) is an important gene regulation process that affects many biological processes in plants. However, the AS pattern changes in plants in response to elevated CO(2 l)evels have not yet been investigated. Here, we used RNA-Seq data of Arabidopsis thaliana grown under different CO2 concentration to analyze the global changes in AS. We found that AS increased with the rise in CO2 concentration. Additionally, we identified 345 differentially expressed (DE) genes and 251 differentially alternative splicing (DAS) genes under the elevated CO2 condition. Moreover, the results showed that the expression of most of the DAS genes did not change significantly, indicating that AS can serve as an independent mechanism for gene regulation in response to elevated CO2. Furthermore, our analysis of function categories revealed that the DAS genes were associated mainly with the stimulus response. Overall, this the first study to explore the changes of AS in plants in response to elevated CO2.

AB Aims: To diagnose a Chinese family with inherited ectopia lentis in a genetic method and analyze the genotype phenotype correlation.
   Methods: The phenotype of each family member was identified by detailed clinical examination. We used targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) to identify mutations in FBN1 in an efficient and accurate way. The mutation in FBN1 was confirmed in all affected family members by Sanger sequencing.
   Results: A novel mutation c.385T > C (p.C129R) in FBN1 was identified in the proband by targeted NGS. The mutation was segregated in all affected family members and contributes to specific disease phenotypes. The same mutation was not found in other unaffected relatives and a 100 normal random population by Sanger sequencing.
   Conclusions: Our study reports a novel mutation in FBN1 in a Chinese family and to diagnose this family as Marfan syndrome, we also expand the genotype-phenotype correlation of this disease.

AB An F-actin scaffold protein, afadin, comprises two splice variants called 1-afadin (a long isoform) and s-afadin (a short isoform). It is known that in adult tissues, 1-afadin is ubiquitously expressed while s-afadin is restrictedly expressed in brain. In cultured cortical neurons, 1-afadin potentiates axonal branching whereas s-afadin blocks axonal branching by functioning as a naturally occurring dominant-negative isoform that forms a heterodimer with 1-afadin. However, the temporal and spatial expression pattern of s-afadin during development or across multiple tissues and organs has not been fully understood. In this study, using Western blotting and RT-qPCR techniques and the fluorescent splicing reporters, we examined the detailed expression patterns of 1- and s-afadin isoforms across various tissues and cell types, including rat organs at developmental stages, primary cultured neuronal and non-neuronal cells prepared from the developing rat brain, and in neurons in vitro generated from P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. Both mRNA and protein of s-afadin were abundantly expressed in various regions of rat neuronal tissues, and their expression dynamically changed during development in vivo. The expression of s-afadin was also detected in primary rat cortical neurons, but not in astrocytes or fibroblasts, and the neuronal expression increased during neuronal maturation in vitro. The dynamic alternative splicing event of afadin during development was successfully visualized with the newly developed fluorescent splicing reporter plasmids at a single cell level. Moreover, s-afadin was undetectable in undifferentiated EC cells, and the expression was induced upon differentiation of the cells into neurons. These data suggest that spatiotemporal and dynamic alternative splicing produces differential expression patterns of afadin isoforms and that alternative splicing of afadin is controlled by the neuron-specific regulator(s) whose activity is triggered and dynamically altered during neuronal differentiation and maturation.

AB MTHFR is a key enzyme in folate metabolism. Some genetic polymorphisms code for a less efficient enzyme, increasing serum concentrations of homocysteine. This has been associated with inadequate feto-maternal circulation and increased risk of spontaneous abortion. Paroxonase 1 (PON1) is a multifunctional enzyme that can detoxify homocysteine through its homocysteine thiolactonase activity. We evaluate the association between MTHFR 677 C > T polymorphisms and non-recurrent spontaneous abortion and its interaction with PON1 polymorphisms involved in homocysteine metabolism in women living in floricultural areas in Mexico. Sociodemographic, reproductive history, folic acid consumption during pregnancy and environmental exposure data of 264 women who had been pregnant sometime during the 10 years prior to study enrolment were collected. MTHFR 677 C > T, PON1 192Q > R and PON1 55L > M genotypes were determined by PCR amplification. Information on pregnancy outcome and maternal genotypes was obtained for 484 pregnancies: 34 non recurrent spontaneous abortions (gestational age < 20 weeks) and 450 controls. GEE models were used to evaluate the association between MTHFR polymorphism and non-recurrent spontaneous abortion, and its interaction with PON1 polymorphisms.
   After adjusting for potential confounders, no significant association was found between the MTHFR 677 C > T matemal polymorphism and non-recurrent spontaneous abortion (OR (CT vs CC) = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.14-1.05; OR (TT vs) (CC) = 0.63, 95% CI: 1.22-1.80). No interactions with PON1 192Q > R or PON1 55L > M polymorphisms were identified (p for interaction = 0.88 and 0.41, respectively). PON1 55L > M maternal polymorphism was associated with higher risk of spontaneous abortion (OR (LM/MM) (vs LL) = 4.14, 95% CI: 1.49-11.54). Our results do not demonstrate an interaction between the MTHFR 677 C > T and PON1 192Q > R or PON1 55L > M maternal polymorphisms neither an independent association of MTHFR 677 C > T polymorphism with non -recurrent spontaneous abortion, whereas PON1 55LM/MM maternal genotype increase the odds of this event.

AB Background: Accumulating studies have reported that GLUT1 is aberrantly expressed in lung cancer; nevertheless, the clinicopathologic significance and the prognostic role of GLUT1 still remain controversial. The aim of this meta-analysis was to identify the clinicopathologic and prognostic implications of the GLUT1 expression in lung cancer patients.
   Materials and methods: Databases with literature published in English, including Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and WanFang database in Chinese were searched comprehensively for relevant studies in August 2017. The pooled odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the clinicopathologic significance and prognostic value of GLUT1 in lung cancer.
   Results: A total of 26 studies (2653 cases) were included in the current study. Totally, 1423 patients from nineteen studies were included to assess the relationships between GLUT1 and clinicopathological parameters, the pooled OR indicated that positive GLUT1 expression was significantly related with classification (adenocarcinomas vs. squamous carcinomas, OR = 0.276, 95% CIs: 0.117-0.651, P = 0.003), tumor differentiation (G3-4 vs. G2-1, OR = 1.944, 95% CIs: 1.384-2.730; P < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (positive vs. negative, OR = 3.65, 95% CIs: 1.82-7.32, P < 0.001),tumor size (large tumor size vs. small tumor size, OR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.42-2.91, P < 0.001), and advanced tumor stages (OR = 2.527, 95% CIs: 1.325-4.820). Regarding the significance of GLUT1 in the overall survival (OS) of lung cancer, the pooled HRs with 1731 lung cancer patients was 1.41 (P = 0.002; 95% CIs: 1.13-1.76). Additionally, the overexpression of GLUT1 could significantly predict the shorter disease-free survival (HR = 1.68, 95% CIs: 1.01-2.79) and disease-specific survival (HR = 1.59, 95% CIs: 1.11-2.29).
   Conclusions: A positive expression of GLUT1 significantly predicts a poor prognosis in lung cancer patients. GLUT1 may server as a helpful biomarker and a potential target for the treatment strategies of lung cancer.

   METAANALYSIS
AB APOE is involved in exogenous and endogenous lipid metabolism and is a candidate gene for coronary heart disease (CHD). Using the SYBR-Green quantitative methylation-specific PCR method, we measured APOE methylation levels in 640 cases of CHD and 436 controls. Meanwhile, we used the Sequenom MassARRAY platform to genotype APOE rs7412 and rs7259620. In men, we found that CHD patients had significantly lower levels of APOE methylation than non-CHD controls (P = 0.044). In addition, rs7412-T and rs7259620-A were protective factors for CHD in males (rs7412-T: OR = 0.527, allele P = 0.004; rs7259620-A: OR = 0.743, allele P = 0.029). In the CHD group and the non-CHD control group, APOE methylation levels were inversely correlated with age (total patients: r = 0.015, P = 0.009, total controls: r = -0.185, P = 1E - 04). In the female control group, the APOE methylation levels were inversely correlated with plasma APOA1 protein levels (female controls: r = -0.188, P = -0.008). In the total controls and female controls, APOE methylation levels were inversely correlated with plasma APOE protein levels (total controls: r = -0.110, P = 0.031, female controls: r = -0.188, P = 0.008). Our GDMR interaction analysis showed that there was an interaction between APOE methylation and rs7412 (P = 0.011). In addition, there was a significant interaction between APOE methylation, rs7259620, gender, smoking, LDL, TC, and APOE protein levels in the risk of CHD (P = 0.011). In summary, our research showed that the methylation of APOE was important for the risk of CHD in men.

AB Copy number variation is a large genome variation which usually happens in the noncoding-region, and it may occur at the locus associated with the functional gene to further influence the phenotype. Potassium inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J 12 (KCNJ12) gene expressed widely in cardiomyocytes and neurons, plays an important role in tumor therapy and muscle movement regulation. In this study, we detected the distribution of CNVs for KCNJ12 gene in 404 individuals belonging to four Chinese cattle breeds (NY, JX, JA and GF). We also investigated the KCNJ12 gene expression in different tissues of JX cattle. Additionally, we examined the association of two CNV regions (CNV1: 1,600 bp, intron 1; CNV2: 4,800 bp, intergenic) with growth traits. The statistical analyses indicated that the CNV1 is associated with the body length, rump length and weight in JX cattle population (P < 0.05); and there has a significant association with the body length, chest circumference, and body weight in GF cattle (P < 0.05).The CNV2 had a significant effect on the body length and body weight in JX cattle (P < 0.05); the body length, chest circumference, rump length and body weight in GF cattle (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). The copy numbers of KCNJ12 gene presented the negative correlations with the transcript level of gene in skeletal muscles (P < 0.05). Our results provide evidence that CNV1 and CNV 2 in KCNJ12 are associated with growth traits in two cattle populations and may be used as candidates for marker assisted selection and breeding management in cattle.

AB Background: Many enzymes involved in one-carbon metabolism (OCM) are considered to have important roles in carcinogenesis, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the influence of polymorphisms in OCM genes on recurrence in HCC patients with liver transplantation has yet not been reported. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of donor liver graft OCM gene polymorphism on the prognosis of liver transplant recipients with HCC.
   Methods: This study enrolled 100 liver transplantation patients from a Chinese Han population to detect the association between donor OCM genes polymorphisms and post-transplant HCC recurrence. Nine SNPs from seven OCM genes (MTHED1, MTR, MTRR, DHFR, ALDHILI, SHMT1, and CBS) were evaluated by Chi-square test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
   Result None of the nine SNPs were significantly associated with cancer recurrence after liver transplantation. However, tumor-free survival for recipients with the AA genotype of rs1801394 polymorphism was significantly shorter than patients with AG/GG genotype (1097 +/- 155 vs. 1657 +/- 173 days, P < 0.05) among patients with alpha-fetoprotein < 400 ng/ml. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that recipients with donor rs1127717 homozygous TT had a significantly longer tumor-free survival and overall survival than heterozygous CT/CC recipients (tumor-free survival 1395 +/- 128 vs. 671 +/- 233 days, P < 0.05; overall survival 1540 +/- 114 vs. 925 +/- 242 days, P < 0.05) in the patient subgroup with well or moderately differentiated HCC.
   Conclusion: This is the first genetic study to examine the relation between donor liver graft OCM gene polymorphisms and the risk of HCC recurrence after liver transplantation. Our findings support the hypothesis that polymorphisms of donor genes related to OCM play important roles in post-transplant HCC recurrence. Furthermore, donor rs1801394 and rs1127717 polymorphism may serve as promising prognostic biomarkers for HCC recurrence in liver transplant recipients.

AB beta-amylase (BAM) genes play essential roles in plant abiotic stress responses. Although the genome of Chinese white pear (Pyrus bretschneideri) has recently been made available, knowledge regarding the BAM family in pear, including gene function, evolutionary history and patterns of gene expression remains limited. In this study, we identified 17 PbBAMs in the pear genome. Of these, 12 PbBAM members were mapped onto 9 chromosomes and 5 PbBAM genes were located on scaffold contigs. Based on gene structure, protein motif analysis, and the topology of the phylogenetic tree of the PbBAM family, we classified member genes into 4 groups. All PbBAM genes were found to contain typical glycosyl hydrolysis 14 domain motifs. Interfamilial comparisons revealed that the phylogenetic relationships of BAM genes in other Rosaceae species were similar those found in pear. We also found that whole-genome duplication (WGD)/segmental duplication events played critical roles in the expansion of the BAM family. Next, we used transcriptomic data to study gene expression during the response of drought and low temperate responses, and found that genes in Group B were related to drought and cold stress. We identified four PbBAM genes associated with abiotic stress in Pear. Finally, by analyzing co-expression networks and co-regulatory genes, we found that PbBAMla and PbBAMlb were associated with the pear abiotic stress response.

AB In plants, the final step of monolignols polymerization is catalyzed by laccase, a key enzyme in lignin biosynthesis. Laccase has been shown a multifunctional enzyme that plays many important roles. As information is not available on the laccase gene family in Citrus sinensis, genome-wide analysis has been carried out in this study using C. sinensis genome. Using bioinformatics approaches, 24 laccase genes (CsLAC1 CsLAC24) were identified from C. sinensis. Most CsLACs were found in C. sinensis chromosome 6, 7 and 8, while no CsLACs were found in chromosome 4, 5 and 9. In most CsLACs, four conserved signature sequences and three typical Cu-oxidase domains were observed. However, the CsLAC-encoding genes displayed distinct intron-exon patterns and relatively low sequence similarity. Phylogenetic clustering analysis indicated that the CsLACs were divided into seven groups, suggesting potential distinct functions and evolution. Putative signal sequences, subcellular location and glycosylation sites were predicted in the CsLACs. Moreover, sixteen CsLAC transcripts, which coding genes were clustering in chromosomes, were found to be potential targets of csi-miR397. Cis-regulatory elements and expression analyses indicated the possible involvement of some CsLAC members in diverse stresses and growth/development processes, respectively. These results may provide valuable clues for further studies on the functions of the CsLACs in citrus growth and adaptation to stress.

AB Aberrant activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin has been shown to promote progression in various cancers, including ovarian cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in Wnt/beta-catenin activation are not well elucidated. In the work, we identify that R-spondin 1 is an upstream regulator in Wnt/beta-catenin pathway to promote growth, survival and migration in ovarian cancer cells. We observe the upregulation of transcript and protein levels of R-spondin 1 in ovarian cancer cell lines and tissues compared to normal counterparts. R-spondin 1 upregulation via genetic (overexpression) and pharmacological (recombinant protein) approaches facilitates growth and migration of normal ovarian cells. R-spondin 1 downregulation via siRNA knockdown decreases proliferation and migration, and induces apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. In addition, recombinant R-spondin 1 protects ovarian cancer cell against chemotherapy whereas R-spondin I knockdown sensitizes ovarian cancer cell response to chemotherapy. Importantly, increasedji-catenin activities and mRNA expression levels of Wnt/beta-catenin-targeted genes are detected in normal ovarian cells overexpressing R-spondin 1. In contrast, R-spondin 1 inhibition suppresses Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in ovarian cancer cells. We further identify that R-spondin 1 regulates ovarian cancer biological activities via activating Wnt/beta-catenin. Our work is the first to highlight the critical roles of R-spondin 1 in ovarian cancer progression and chemoresistance. Our work also provides a proper understanding on the regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in ovarian cancer.

AB Citrus maxima "seedless" is originally from Malaysia, and now is widely cultivated in Hainan province, China. The essential features of this cultivar are thin skin, green epicarp and seedless at the ripening stage. Here, using C. maxima "seedless" as experimental material, we investigated the physical and inclusion indicators, and found the accumulation of storage compounds during 120-210 DAF leading to inconsistent increase between volume and weight. Component analysis of soluble sugar indicated that arabinose and xylose have a high content in early development of pummelo juice sacs (PJS), whereas fructose, glucose and sucrose show a significant increase during PJS maturation. To clarify a global overview of the gene expressing profiles, the PJSs from four periods (60, 120, 180 and 240 DAF) were selected for comparative transcriptome analysis. The resulting 8275 unigenes showed differential expression during PJS development. Also, the stability of 11 housekeeping genes were evaluated by geNorm method, resulting in a set of five genes (UBC, ACT, OR23, DWA2 and CYP21D) used as control for normalization of gene expression. Based on transcriptome data, 5 sucrose synthases (SUSs) and 10 invertases (INVs) were identified to be involved in sucrose degradation. Importantly, SUS4 may be responsible for arabinose and xylose biosynthesis to form the cell wall in early development, while SUS3 and VIN2 may be important in the accumulation of soluble hexose leading to cell expansion through an osmotic-independent pathway in late development. The information provides valuable metabolite and genetic resources in C. maxima "seedless", and is important for achieving high fruit yield and quality.

AB The black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is widely distributed, and has strong drought resistance and salt tolerance. These characteristics make it the best type of tree for landscaping and resource conservation in China. In this study, the chloroplast genomes of five black locusts were identified de novo and the evolutionary relationship among these black locusts and their taxonomic statuses in leguminous plants were determined. The chloroplast structures of the five black locusts were typical and had four parts, including two single copy regions (large and small single copy sections) and a pair of inverted repeats (IRs). Genome sizes were between 155,364 bp and 155,655 bp; the genome of R. pseudoacacia var. decaisneana was the smallest, while that of R. pseudoacacia var. tortuosa was the largest. The genomes contained 124-130 protein-coding genes; R. pseudoacacia var. tortuosa had the fewest, while R. hispida and R. pseudoacacia var. decaisneana had the most. In this study, eight to ten genes from chloroplast genomes contained introns. Nine genes from the chloroplast genomes of R. pseudoacacia and R. pseudoacacia f. unifolia contained introns that had lost the trnL-CAA gene via evolution, while eight chloroplast genes of R. pseudoacacia var. tortuosa contained introns that had lost the trnL-CAA and psaA genes. Among them, the rpoC1 gene had the longest introns at 2828 bp, and rps12 + had the smallest introns at only 533 bp. There were various amplification phenomena in the IR region among the five black locusts. Most of the protein-coding genes of the five black locusts had a high degree of codon preference. To determine the phylogenetic positions of the five black locusts, we conducted a systematic evolutionary analysis using common protein-coding genes in chloroplast sequences from 34 species of leguminous plants and 12 other species. The results showed that the relationship between Robinia and Acacia ligulata was the most distant among those of the leguminous plants, and the relationship between Robinia and Lotus japonicus was the closest. The chloroplast protein-coding genes in different black locusts were relatively conservative by evolutionary selection pressure analysis standards. These results are important for our understanding of their photosynthetic mechanisms and evolution, and the transgenic engineering of their chloroplasts.

AB Individuals carrying the ATC/TTC haplotype (Hap-1) in the interleukin 8 (IL8) gene were reported as more susceptible to chronic periodontitis (CP), an infectious disease associated with Gram-negative bacteria, in comparison to patients with the ATT/TTC haplotype (Hap-2). This study investigated the functionality of the IL8 haplotypes in lymphocytes and monocytes of individuals carrying the Hap-1 or Hap-2 IL8 haplotypes in the response to CP-associated Gram-negative bacteria (periodontopathogens). Peripheral blood was collected from 6 subjects carrying each haplotype, and their immune cells were challenged with periodontopathogens or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) plus Ionomycin. Depending on the immune cell type (lymphocytes or monocytederived macrophages) the assessed outcomes were: phenotypical polarization, gene expression, phagocytic activity, chemotaxis and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Subjects carrying the Hap-1 haplotype showed increased expression of IL8 and TNFA and significantly skewing towards pro-inflammatory Th1/M1/Th17 phenotypes. There was increased percentage of ROS-producing monocyte-derived macrophages from individuals carrying the Hap-1 haplotype. Cells from individuals presenting the Hap-2 haplotype had an overall attenuated response to periodontopathogens, with a significant shift towards the Treg phenotype. In conclusion, the IL8 haplotypes showed to be functional both in monocyte-derived macrophages and lymphocytes. The Hap-1 haplotype previously associated with increased susceptibility to CP demonstrated greater skewing to pro-inflammatory Th1/M1/Th17 phenotypes and production of ROS.

AB Young-onset hypertensives (YOHs) with resistant hypertension (RH) have a greater long-term cardiovascular risk. The present study examined whether a functional adiponectin T94G polymorphism (rs2241766) is associated with RH in YOHs. We analyzed data from the Academia Sinica Collaborative Study on Hypertension Genetics in Taiwanese subjects to compare rs2241766 between YOHs with and without RH (<= 50 years of age). RH was defined as the need for at least 3 drugs, including a diuretic to control blood pressure. Genotyping of rs2241766 was performed using TaqMan allelic discrimination. A total of 861 YOHs were enrolled and 54 had RH in enrolled population. For the rs2241766 in the allelic model, the odds ratio (OR) of RH allele frequency was 2.45 (p = 0.008), and there was a linear relationship between allele numbers and the presence of RH (p = 0.005). In multivariate analysis, the rs2241766 (OR = 2.766, p = 0.002), age (OR = 1.103, p = 0.001), uric acid (OR = 1.322, p = 0.001), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (OR = 2.769, p = 0.001) and aldosterone (OR = 1.004, p = 0.001) were independently associated with the presence of RH. In the Taiwanese population, the adiponectin T94G polymorphism (rs2241766) is associated with RH in YOHs.

AB Genetic polymorphism has great influences on the improvement of cattle traits. The polymorphism of the same gene family will greatly change the growth traits of cattle, such as the pleomorphic adenoma gene (PLAG) family. Many studies have shown that the PLAG family proteins are the transcription regulators of nuclear protein, which mainly regulates the expression of many important genes in the body. In cattle, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within or near the PLAG1 gene is associated with economic traits of height in cattle. Here we investigate a SNPs of bovine PLAG1 in 646 cattle from five breeds. We found three different genotypes by using cleaved amplification polymorphism sequence-tagged sites (CAPs), includes some significant differences in body height, chest circumference and other shapes (P < 0.05), also we found that the TT genotype had no advantage in body shape. These results indicate that the selection of PLAG1 gene could be used to ensure the breeding direction for growth traits of the beef cattle.

AB The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac, known to cause hyperuricemia and concomitant visceral gout in Gyps vultures is suggested to be a result of interference with renal uric acid excretion. Three species of Gyps vultures are on the verge of extinction due to nephrotoxic veterinary diclofenac having entered the food chain, notwithstanding the fact that the toxicity of different avian species to the NSAIDs like diclofenac varies. The multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4), an organic anion transporter in birds has unique role in unidirectional efflux of urate into proximal renal tubular lumen for excretion and maintenance of homeostasis. We characterized MRP4 channel at molecular level to predict its structural based ligand binding activity in Gallus domesticus (Indian domestic chicken) and Gyps himalayensis (Himalayan griffon vulture). MRP4 gene was amplified using reverse transcribed cDNA from renal tissue sample in overlapping fragments. The obtained amplicons were cloned, sequenced, assembled and analyzed. Multiple alignment and blast analysis revealed point variations and presence of additional stretch of 57 bp towards the 3' end which was confirmed in Real time PCR. Predicted MRP4 polypeptides revealed presence of characteristic 12 transmembrane helices (TMH) with two nucleotide binding domains (NBD). Additional 19 amino acids in transcript variant was found to be localized in NBD2 that might influence the transporter function. The homology modeling and pocket identification throws ample light on varying transport efficacy and paves the way for depicting its role of these amino acids in effect of diclofenac on urate transport in further studies.

AB cis-Prenyltransferases (cis-PTs) constitute a large family of enzymes conserved during evolution and present in all domains of life. cis-PTs catalyze the cis-1,4-polymerization of isoprene units to generate isoprenoids with carbon skeletons varying from C10 (neryl pyrophosphate) to C > 10,000 (natural rubber). Though the previously reported CPTs in Hevea are designated based on sequence variations, their classification was done mostly by phylogenetic analysis using a mixture of partial as well as full length sequences often excluding the UTRs. In this context an attempt was made to reclassify the CPTs strictly based on their sequence similarity and distinguish the members putatively associated with rubber biosynthesis from the others. Extensive computational analysis was carried out on CPT sequences obtained from public resources and whole genome assemblies of Hevea. Based on the results from BLAST analysis, multiple sequence alignments of protein, nucleotide and untranslated regions, open reading frame analysis, gene prediction analysis and sequence length variations, we conclude that there exists mainly three CPTs namely RubCPT1, RubCPT2 and RubCPT3 putatively associated with rubber biosynthesis in Hevea brasiliensis. The rest were categorised as variants of dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase (DHDDS) involved in the synthesis of dolichols having short chain isoprenoids. Analysis of the sequence structure of the most highly expressed RubCPT1 in latex revealed the allele richness and diversity of this important variant prevailing in the popular rubber clones. Haplotypes consisting of SNPs with high degree of heterozygosity were also identified. Segregation and linkage disequilibrium analysis confirmed that recombination is the major contributor towards the generation of allelic diversity rather than point mutations. Alternatively, gene expression analysis indicated the possibility of association between specific haplotypes and RubCPT1 expression in Hevea clones which may have downstream impact up to the level of rubber production. The conclusions from this study may pave way for the identification and better understanding of CPTs directly involved with natural rubber biosynthesis in Hevea and the SNP data generated may aid in the development of molecular markers putatively associated with yield in rubber.

AB Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder causing common health problem with increasing age. Evidences show that the key symptoms of AD are mainly caused by cholinergic system dysfunction which has a role in cognitive disorders. Cholinergic pathways especially muscarinic receptors like M-1 subtype also have a major role in learning, memory, cognitive functions and emotional state. There is no available permanent treatment currently to cure AD or to change its progression. This study was designed to investigate the factors that play important role in pathogenesis of AD and to compare the effects of Galantamine treatment with effects of Myrtus communis treatment. The expression level of M-1, ACh, BDNF; AChE activity, GSH level, MDA and MPO activity and AChE gene expression were investigated in scopolamine-induced rat model. Results showed that, administration of MC significantly improves the SCOP-induced reduction of latency and object recognition time; increasing BDNF, M-1 and ACh receptor expression levels in the different brain regions. Additionally, MC showed an increased in AChE by enhancing GSH activity and reducing MDA level and MPO activity. In conclusion MC considered as a possible novel therapeutic approach that can be a valuable alternative way in the prevention and treatment of AD.

AB This review focuses on the current knowledge of transcription factors involved in Arabidopsis anther development. Anther development is a multistage process and controlled by a complex network of transcription factors acting in spatio/temporal manner. Molecular understanding of anther developmental pathway is critical from the perspective of controlling male fertility and hybrid generation. Generation of hybrid lines relies upon the effective mechanisms of controlling the process of pollen development and pollen release. Controlling any developmental program requires a good knowledge of regulatory pathways governing that developmental program. In a regulatory pathway, transcription factors represent an important link between the developmental program and response of genes to growth regulators and environmental signals. Therefore, identifying the entire cohort of anther specific transcription factors is an essential step towards the molecular understanding of regulatory networks involved in pollen formation and pollen release.

AB Osteoarthritis (OA) constitutes the most common disease of degenerative joints, with chondrocytes playing an important role in disease progression. However, the underlying pathobiological mechanisms have not been fully characterized. In this study, we investigated the role of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1)-regulated autophagy in chondrocyte proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. The data showed that YAP1, a transcriptional coactivator, was overexpressed in OA tissues from a murine model of OA, as analyzed by real time PCR and western blot. Overexpression of YAP1 significantly suppressed ATDC5 chondrogenic cell proliferation and decreased the expression of differentiation-related genes including Runx2, osteocalcin, and collagen I, and elevated cell apoptosis, whereas these cellular processes were reversed by knockdown of YAP1. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that YAP1 co-localized with the autophagy regulator beclinl. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that this interaction was enhanced in OA tissues. In contrast, YAP1 lacking the internal WW domains failed to interact with beclinl and was unable to inhibit beclinl ubiquitination. This resulted in up regulated autophagy, which significantly improved OA by increasing chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. Notably, YAP1 expression was significantly downregulated by various anti-OA drugs. Finally, the Yap1 promoter was activated by transcriptional factors AP2 alpha and SP1, whereas its 3'UTR was targeted by miR-5624-5p, miR-33-3p, and miR-6918-5p. In conclusion, inhibition of YAP1 could facilitate beclin1-regulated autophagy in OA, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach to combat OA.

AB Meconopsis (Papaveraceae) is an interesting alpine herb, mainly distributed in the mountainous area of southwest China and high altitude zone in Tibetan-Himalaya. Different Meconopsis species showed a flower color alteration in different anthesis stages, Meconopsis `Lingholm' is one of the localized species whose petal color changes from purple to blue during the flowering process. In general, the blue color flower is a rare kind, and usually hard to cultivate artificially. The molecular mechanism of flower color formation and color alteration of alpine flowers were reported by many research workers. To find critical genes that regulate Meconopsis `Lingholm' color alteration and the mechanism of environmental adaptation, the current study performed transcriptome sequencing by using Meconopsis `Lingholm' petals from different anthesis stages. There were totally 91,615 unigenes obtained from 31.4 Gb sequencing data, and differentially expressed genes between two consecutive flowering stages were obtained. Bioinformatics studies showed genes regulating petal color alteration were activated. Moreover, the functional analysis showed that Meconopsis `Lingholm' showed a stress response to mechanical damage, non-biological stimulation and water deficiency in the bud stage, as well as showed a stress response to the cold from cracking stage to blooming stage. Furthermore, RNA-Seq results were verified using nine randomly selected genes by qPCR, which showed same expression trend with sequencing results. During this study, 20 candidate genes identified for further studies, which included five petal color related genes and 15 environmental response genes.

AB Familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis is an autosomal-recessive renal tubular disorder characterized by excessive urinary losses of magnesium and calcium, bilateral nephrocalcinosis and progressive chronic renal failure in childhood or adolescence. The disease is caused by mutations in the tight junction proteins claudin-16 and claudin-19 that are encoded by the CLDN16 and CLDN19 genes, respectively. Patients with CLDN19 mutations also are affected with severe ocular abnormalities. The aim of our study was to identify and characterize the molecular defects causing this disease in a Georgian girl and two Spanish siblings. Clinical and biochemical parameters were studied. The CLDN16 and CLDN19 genes were analyzed by DNA sequencing. The functional consequences of the identified mutations on pre-mRNA splicing were investigated using a minigene assay. Sequence analysis revealed that the patient from Georgia was homozygous for a novel mutation, c.602G > A; p.(G201E), in exon 4 of the CLDN16 gene. The two Spanish siblings were homozygous for a new CLDN19 mutation, c.388G > T; p.(G130C), located in exon 2, and both parents were heterozygous carriers of the mutation. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that the amino acid substitutions generated by these mutations were pathogenic. Functional studies showed that mutation c.388G > T also results in partial skipping of CLDN19 exon 2, which would imply significant alterations in the claudin-19 protein structure. Conversely, CLDN16 mutation c.602G > A had no effect on pre-mRNA splicing. Our study expands the genotypic classification of this rare disease and provides the first report of a CLDN19 mutation affecting splicing.

AB Groupers are coral fish species of prime ecological and economic significance. The interactions among them and other coral reefs organisms aid the healthiness and species balance in this fundamental marine niches. Also, groupers are among the top priced fisheries species. The Egyptian habitats of the Red Sea are lacking genetic studies that assess species diversity for the final goal of conservation and fisheries management. Moreover, morphological similarities among these organisms sometimes hinder a proper species identification. Hence, more accurate groupers authentication methods are crucially required. Sixteen grouper species belonging to the genera Epinephelus, Anyperodon, Cephaolopholes, Aethaloperca, Variola, and Plectropomus, present in the Red Sea in Egypt, were investigated for species authentication through mitochondrial DNA variations, applying cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and 12srRNA genes sequencing. GenBank comparisons, phylogenetic analyses and comparisons of pairwise distances were carried out. All these analyses aimed to species authentication and identifying their relations at the international scale. The results exhibited > 98% identity with E. fasciatus, A. rogaa, C. oligosticta, E. areolatus, V. loud, P. areolatus, E. malabaricus, C. sexmaculata, E. summana, E. chlorostigma, E. polyphekadion, C. miniataus, A. leucogrammicus, E. tauvina, C. argus, C. hemistiktos. Pairwise distances showed a clear increase upon raising comparison level from among species to among-genera. Combined 12srRNA and COI genes sequencing resulted in an accurate tool for Egyptian Red Sea grouper species unambiguous discrimination. This can provide vital aid to the active efforts for these species conservation and fisheries management in Egypt and the world.

AB Okadaic acid (OA), a potent polyether marine toxin, accumulates in the digestive glands of marine mollusks and therefore can severely threaten the health of humans after ingestion of contaminated shellfish. In vivo and in vitro studies have revealed that exposure of various cells, including human embryonic amniotic cells, hepatocytes, neuroblastoma cells, to OA induces morphological and functional modifications as well as the death of cells. As the number of reports on OA poisoning has increased, this toxin has gradually attracted the public's attention, and researchers are trying to study it. This review summarizes the current literature on the toxicity effects of OA, in addition to its detection and detoxification.

AB Monofluoroacetate (MFA) is considered one of the most toxic substances known. It is found naturally in plants, and causes sudden death syndrome in ruminants. Due to hyperacute evolution of poisoning and the absence of effective treatment, induction of resistance in animals might be the best tool to control MFA poisoning in ruminants. The objective of this study was to promote resistance in cattle against the toxic effects of MFA through its degradation by the ruminal microbiota after the administration of sodium trifluoroacetate (TFA). Ten calves were distributed into two groups: control group (n = 3) and treated group (n = 7). The calves in the treated group received 0.1 mg/kg live weight of TFA, whereas, those in the control group received water; both for 28 consecutive days. The calves were subjected to daily clinical evaluation and weekly blood biochemical determination to identify any signs of poisoning. After 28 d of administration of TFA or water, 2.0 g/kg body weight of Palicourea marcgravii leaves (containing 0.15% MFA) were administered using a stomach tube to determine the occurrence of resistance. The administration of TFA did not induce any clinical or biochemical changes in blood. The administration of P. marcgravii induced clinical changes in the calves of control group, but there was no change in the calves of the treated group. In conclusion, the administration of TFA to cattle can induce effective resistance against MFA poisoning.

They have mutagenic, teratogenic, carcinogenic, immunosuppressive and endocrine disrupting effects on both humans and animals. The ubiquitous occurrence and heat stability of these mycotoxins during food and feed processing pose serious health problems in human and animals. Therefore successful biotechnological detoxification tools are in great demand. Recently, the use of bacteria, yeast, moulds and enzymes to mitigate/bind or biodegrade various mycotoxins is a novel strategy used for mycotoxins removal. In this review, recent development in biological control of mycotoxins removal and detoxification will be discussed.

AB Phytoremediation with aquatic macrophyte has been considered as an eco-friendly technique for controlling harmful cyanobacteria outbreak and proven to be effective. The conventional water quality parameters are frequently measured to evaluate the effectiveness of phytoremediation. However, the concentration of microcystin-leucine-arginine (MC-LR) in different vegetated water still remains uncertain. In this study, the contents of MC-LR in four macrophyte-vegetated lagoons were determined by solid phase extraction and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry technology. Results indicated that MC-LR was found in Nymphaea tetragona lagoon (lagoon-S), Vallisneria spiralis lagoon (lagoon-B) and another Vallisneria spiralis lagoon (lagoon-J). Only in lagoon dominated by Pistia stradotes L. (lagoon-D), MC-LR concentration was undiscovered regardless of seasonal variation. The levels of varied seasonally and were affected by the different vegetated aquatic macrophytes. The results suggest that in addition to conventional physicochemical parameters and indicators of water quality, MC-LR levels should be taken into consideration when the effectiveness of phytoremediation is assessed.

AB Food and feed commodities are often contaminated by more than one mycotoxin. Among the several combinations that frequently occur, fusariotoxins are often mentioned. The multi-mycotoxins contamination is a serious threat for health. In the present study we investigated the toxic interactions between deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NIV), and fusarenon-X (FX) in Jurkat T cells by using the MTT assay. The tested mycotoxins alone or in combination had a dose dependent effect on proliferating lymphocytes. According to IC50, it could be classified in decreasing order of toxicity: FX > NIV > DON > DON + FX > NIV + FX > DON + NIV > DON + NIV + FX. The type of mycotoxin interactions was assessed by calculating the combination index (CI) and the dose reduction index (DRI). Our data indicate that an antagonistic effect was strongly observed in binary combination between DON and NIV at higher concentrations and ternary mixtures. Meanwhile, the DON and FX mixtures generated moderate antagonism, while NIV and FX provoked different interactions. The effects of tested mycotoxins on apoptosis were also determined using a FACScan flow cytometer. At IC75, the percentages of apoptotic cells in all treatment groups were significantly different when compared to control group but no significant differences among treatment groups was observed. Taken together, our data suggest that immunotoxicity among multi-mycotoxins contamination cannot be predicted based on individual effects but depends on the mixtures, ratio and/or concentrations in the product, as well as type of target cells.

AB Human accidents with venomous snakes represent an overwhelming public health problem, mainly in rural populations of underdeveloped countries. Their high incidence and the severity of the accidents result in 81,000 to 138,000 deaths per year. The treatment is based on the administration of purified antibodies, produced by hyper immunization of animals to generate immunoglobulins (Igs), and then obtained by fractionating hyper immune plasma. The use of recombinant antibodies is an alternative to conventional treatment of snakebite envenoming, particularly the Fv fragment, named the single-chain variable fragment (scFv). We have produced recombinant single chain variable fragment scFv against the venom of the pit viper Bothrops asper at high levels expressed transiently and stably in transgenic plants and in vitro cultures that is reactive to BaP1 (a metalloproteinase from B. asper venom). The yield from stably transformed plants was significantly (p > 0.05) higher than the results in from transient expression. In addition, scFvBaP1 yields from systems derived from stable transformation were: transgenic callus 62 mu g/g (+/- 2); biomass from cell suspension cultures 83 mu g/g (+/- 0.2); culture medium from suspensions 71.75 mg/L (+/- 6.18). The activity of scFvBaP1 was confirmed by binding and neutralization of the fibrin degradation induced by BnP1 toxins from B. neuwiedi and by Atroxlysin Ia from B. atrox venoms. In the present work, we demonstrated the potential use of plant cells to produce scFvBaP1 to be used in the future as a biotechnological alternative to horse immunization protocols to produce anti-venoms to be used in human therapy against snakebites.

AB Enabling the use of castor cake in animal feeding is an excellent alternative strategy to reduce feed costs. The cake is a by-product derived from the extraction of the castor oil by the biodiesel industry whose chemical composition is satisfactory despite the presence of antinutritional factors like toxic lectins, which require detoxification before it can be used as a dietary ingredient. The aim of the present study was to evaluate alternative chemical sources in the degradation and inactivation of ricin and Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA), two lectins from castor cake. Ten chemical compounds were evaluated: sodium hydroxide, monodicalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate, calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, calcitic limestone, magnesian limestone, urea, potassium chloride, and sodium chloride. Gel electrophoresis indicated 100% lectin degradation only in the cakes treated with 90 g sodium hydroxide and 2500 mL water per kg of cake. The hemagglutination assay was crucial to providing innocuousness to the treated cakes, with total absence of hemagglutinating activity observed in the castor cakes treated with 60 or 90 g sodium hydroxide in water volumes equal to or higher than 1500 mL/kg of castor cake and in the cakes treated with 90 g calcium oxide with 2500 or 3000 mL water/kg castor cake. Thus, though depending on the concentration of the chemical compound and on the volume of water per kilogram of treated cake, sodium hydroxide and calcium oxide showed to be promising chemical products for degradation and complete inactivation of the lectins present in castor cake to allow its use as an ingredient in animal diets.

AB A new Energy Management Strategy to save hydrogen is proposed for the Hybrid Power Systems based on Renewable Energies Sources and Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell system used as additional energy sources and backup energy source, respectively. The Power Following control of the Fuel Cell boost converter compensates the requested power on the DC bus in order to mitigate the DC power dynamics due to variability of load demand and uncertainty about available power from renewable sources. Also, two optimization loops based on the Global Extremum Seeking algorithm are used to find the global optimum of the optimization function by real-time control of both fueling rates. The Static Feed-Forward strategy with the same Power Following control is implemented and used as reference in order to compare the hydrogen savings considering the same scenarios for the DC power dynamics (variable or constant load, without or with power from renewable sources).

AB The flexibility enhancement of the coal-fired combined heat and power (CHP) plant can contribute to both renewable energy integration and decarbonization. In this research, we classify the flexibility enhancement technologies into the "power to heat (P2H)" mode and "auxiliary heat source (AHS)" mode based on their principles and operational strategies. Then thermodynamic performances of both modes are compared with the designed heat load and one-day loads. After that, the techno-economic analysis is also conducted. Results show that with the designed heat load, the power load factor range of the CHP plant is extended from 54.87%-78.72% to 25.20%-100% with the AHS mode, and to 0-78.72% with the electric boiler. And compared to integration with the heat-only boiler, the coal consumption of CHP plant can be increased by 2.27% with the thermal energy storage (TES) system (Electric boiler), and reduced by 0.78%, 1.85%, 2.33%, 3.34% with the electric boiler, electric heat pump, TES system (Extraction steam) and waste heat recovery, respectively. The techno-economic analysis indicates that during the heating period, the net annual revenues of the TES system and electric boiler are 2.14 M$ and 1.71 M$ higher than that of the heat-only boiler. This study gives a methodology on choosing the technology to enhance the flexibility for the coal-fired CHP plant.

AB The production of increasingly clean engines has become imperative. More stringent regulations for internal combustion engines are constantly proposed, and recent number-based regulations have become a new challenge, since historically only a mass-based regulation needed to be met. It is known that soot particles detectable at the exhaust of an engine are the results of the competition between the formation of soot precursor species and their oxidation. However, the attention is mainly focused on inhibiting soot precursors formation, and much less research is dedicated at elucidating the benefits achievable from enhancing soot oxidation rates. Soot oxidation can be enhanced by increasing the in-cylinder oxygen content. Oxygenated fuels, which are often added to gasoline in order to achieve more efficient combustion, can represent a possible way in the pursuit of this goal. However, chemical mechanisms are still uncertain for practical fuels, and ambiguous results can be produced when the effect of oxygenated fuels on gasoline engine combustion and soot emissions is considered. In the present study, 3-D Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations were performed and the numerical results were compared with existing experimental data, in which load increases were achieved by pure oxygen addition within the intake manifold of a single-cylinder Spark-Ignition (SI) engine. Studying the effects that an addition of 5% and 10% by volume (with respect to air) of additional oxygen produces on the combustion process, allowed to provide basic additional information on soot formation and oxidation, avoiding the uncertainties associated with chemistry models. A semi-detailed soot model and a chemical kinetic model, including poly-aromatic hydrocarbon formation, were coupled with the G-equation flame propagation model for the SI engine simulations and for predicting soot mass and particulate number density. Improvements in the modeling of gasoline premixed combustion were achieved, as well. Specifically, different approaches in the evaluation of the laminar flame speed of gasoline (which is a key factor for obtaining reliable SI engine simulations) were critically compared and analyzed. The numerical results showed aspects that were not possible to appreciate by only referring to the experimental results on which this work was based. It was possible to observe that the higher soot concentrations were located in regions characterized by lower temperatures and lower OH concentrations. Oxygen addition favored a faster burning velocity and produced higher in-cylinder temperatures. However, the production rates of both OH radicals and soot precursor species resulted enhanced. The analysis of these concurrent phenomena allowed to explain why in the experiments the soot mass per kg of fuel was lower for the oxygenated combustion cases.

AB A novel Stirling-like irreversible electrochemical thermo-capacitive regenerative cycle operating between a heat reservoir and a heat sink for harvesting low-grade heat is proposed, in which the main irreversible losses are considered. Expressions for the efficiency and power output of the cycle are derived. The inherent regenerative heat loss of the cycle is revealed. The influences of several important parameters, such as the capacitance of the supercapacitor, charge ratio, endpoint voltage of the charging process on the power output of the cycle are discussed. The maximum power output and corresponding efficiency are calculated. The results show that when the charging endpoint voltage of the electrochemical thermo-capacitive regenerative cycle is 10 V, the maximum power output is 31.9 W and the efficiency at the maximum power output can reach 12.8%, which is 51.2% of the Carnot efficiency. The optimal values for several parameters at the maximum power output are determined. The parametric optimum selection criteria of the cycle are provided. The results obtained can ensure the cycle to operate in the optimum states.

AB A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is a high-efficiency technology for combined heat and power (CHP) generation. Heat and power production can be varied according to changes in heat and power loads, which affect the electrical and thermal efficiencies. This study analyzes changes in heat and power production rates of a bio-oil sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR) and SOFC system. The variations in the stack-to-burner ratio (bio-oil split fractions), fuel utilization factor (U-f), and recirculation ratio (R) are investigated. The effect of heat-to-power ratio on the system performance and CO2 capture efficiencies is also studied. Moreover, the benefit of the implementation of a bio-oil SESR and SOFC system over a conventional operation to match the energy demand for an industrial case is evaluated. The results reveal that an increase in U-f decreases the operating range of the heat-to-power ratio. On the other hand, the anode gas recirculation ratio affects such a parameter when the system performs at the high stack-to-burner ratio. A higher heat-to-power ratio increases the stack electrical and thermal efficiencies, leading to a higher CHP efficiency. The heat-to-power ratio of the proposed system varies between 0.05 and 7.5. However, to attain a CO2 capture efficiency higher than 50%, the heat-to-power ratio should be lower than 1.5. By comparing the two operational strategies: fixed heat-to-power ratio, and variable heat-to-power ratio, it is found that the heat-to-power ratio is an important factor for energy management. The primary energy saving is enhanced when the system is operated to satisfy the rates of heat and power demand.

AB Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of biomass is a promising technology for hydrogen production. A novel pilot plant of SCWG that uses solar energy (henceforth SCWG-Solar) was constructed in State Key Laboratory of Multiphase Flow in Power Engineering to take SCWG a significant step closer to industrialization. The total throughput of biomass and water was designed up to 1 t/h. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to evaluate the environmental performance of SCWG-Solar process and its main environmental burdens. LCA was conducted using the SimaPro V8.2.3 software, and the Ecoinvent 3.0 database within the program. A sensitivity analysis on crucial parameters was performed to determine the environmental performance enhancement of SCWG-Solar process. LCA results showed that the SCWG-Solar system operation contributes approximately 58% to the total environmental impact. The construction of a solar concentrator mostly contributes to the environment emissions from the construction of the SCWG-Solar system. The environmental impact can be reduced by utilizing solar energy heated preheater and combining suitable post-treatment technologies of methane by-products with the SCWG-Solar system. The GWP decreases with the increase of feeding biomass slurry concentration and the GWP is close to a minimum when the biomass concentration reaches 30 wt%. GWP from the SCWG-Solar operation, which is 4.41 kg CO2-eq/kgH(2) for 1-MC process, is comparable to the solar based hydrogen production by two-step water splitting. Hence, the LCA in this study indicates that the SCWG-Solar is an environmentally friendly technology, although the system still has room for improvement.

AB This paper presents an optimization study on self-evaporation vapor cooled shield (VCS) in liquid hydrogen (LH2) storage tank with multilayer insulation (MLI). Production from other clean energy sources (such as solar energy, wind energy and biomass energy) and combustion without pollution make H-2 a promising renewable energy source to reduce air pollution and greenhouse effect. Due to the advantages of low pressure and high energy density, LH2 storage has broad prospects in aerospace and civil market. Because of low critical temperature and volatility, LH2 tank poses severe requirements to MLI. In order to reduce heat leak into tank, VCS was set up to cool MLI by retrieving the sensible heat of discharged cryogenic gas hydrogen (GH(2)). In this study, a simplified thermodynamic model is established to investigate the optimal position of VCS in MLI, and the effect of VCS on heat leak into tank and temperature profile through MLI has been studied. Compared with heat leak without VCS, the maximum decrease with Single-VCS is 50.16% and Double-VCS by 59.44%. VCS can also play a positive role under the condition of vacuum failure, and its inhibiting the sharp increase of heat leak is of great significance in emergencies.

AB Drawbacks of fossil fuels have drawn more attention to engines with the possibility of green energy consumption. Stirling engines have the possibility of reverse function and the possibility to produce coldness. In this study, a ST500 gamma-type Stirling engine was run using a power supply to produce coldness and subzero temperatures. The engine is started up for a specific time and then water is circulated in coils wrapped around the cooling section to measure the amount of heat transfer. In this study, a MATLAB code was used to validate the results. A simulation code was written and validated in past works by the writers of the current paper. Also, in this paper the code was changed to be used for refrigeration cycle. Results show that setup theoretical efficiency is 0.28 and practical efficiency is 0.27 at the best case. The Gamma-type Stirling refrigerator used in the current study has better results in comparison with other reported results for V-type and Free-piston Stirling refrigerators in the pressure of 3 bar. Another point to note in Stirling refrigerator is that Stirling refrigerator output temperature can be lowered to subzero temperatures, even down to -200 degrees C. The minimum temperature achieved in the current study is -16.6 degrees C.

AB Photovoltaic thermal heat pump system has gained much popularity in the recent research field, which generally refers to the integration of photovoltaic and solar assisted heat pump to meet the various building energy demand. In this paper, dual-use roll-bond photovoltaic thermal heat pump system employing new roll-bond photovoltaic thermal unit has been proposed and investigated experimentally. The system operation principles and the design method of the main components are introduced in more details. A mathematical model of each component of the system is developed according to distributed and lumped parameter models. The tri-generation performance evaluation method of the unit and system is also proposed. The experimental investigation on the tri-generation performance of the system is carried out simultaneously, in terms of the heating, cooling and power supply capacity. Through analysis, it is evident that the proposed system has the potential to provide space cooling, hot water, and electricity for buildings with high efficiency and long-term stable working condition. Furthermore, the detailed performance parameters analysis has been carried out. The results demonstrate that the roll-bond photovoltaic thermal heat pump system is practically feasible and has a large potential for building energy conservation.

AB The irreversible loss of heat transfer between working fluid and LNG in the condensation process of the single stage cycle which uses liquefied natural gas (LNG) cold energy to generate power is large, resulting in low power generation capacity. This can be improved effectively by combining separated cycles in series or in parallel. But which combination method (in series or in parallel) is more suitable for LNG cold energy power generation systems is not well understood. Therefore, in this paper, eight different systems are compared by combining single-stage condensation Rankine cycle and two-stage condensation Rankine cycle in series and in parallel respectively. Taking the net power output as the objective function, the key parameters and working fluids of the eight systems are simultaneously optimized at four different LNG vaporization pressures. The results show that with the increase of LNG vaporization pressure, the net power output of the system decreases. The vaporization pressure of LNG has an important influence on the system configuration (combination method) and working fluid selection. When the LNG vaporization pressure is 0.6 MPa or 2.5 MPa, the system S-T2B2 (Both top cycle and bottom cycle are two-stage condensation Rankine cycle in series) with the working fluid R32/R1150 (top cycle/bottom cycle) has the largest net power output. When the LNG vaporization pressure is 3.0 MPa or 7.0 MPa, the system P-L2R2 (Both left cycle and right cycle are two-stage condensation Rankine cycle in parallel) with the working fluid R41/R143a (left cycle/right cycle) has the highest net power output. From the economical point of view, when the LNG vaporization pressure is 0.6 MPa, the system S-T1B2 is recommended. When the LNG vaporization pressures are 2.5 MPa and 3.0 MPa, the system P-L1R1 is recommended. When the LNG vaporization pressures is 7.0 MPa, the system P-L2R2 is recommended.

AB Solar energy is one of the most promising renewable energy sources in the equatorial zone of Malaysia. The availability of moderate solar energy during the year makes it possible to be used as a heat source for a solar thermal system. In order to determine the potential application of the solar thermal system, a feasibility study of a small-scale solar cogeneration system under measured solar radiation condition is conducted. In this work, the concept design of a 50-kW solar cogeneration system is proposed which consists of a parabolic trough collector with aperture area of 1154 m(2), thermal storage system and an Organic Rankine Cycle power conversion system. The performance of the system was simulated using the measured direct normal irradiance during the months of May, June and July in 2018. A net gross electric power of 6373 kWh, 6201 kWh and 5155 kWh were produced with the total monthly available solar energy of 82,809 kWh, 77,592 kWh and 64,239 kWh for May, June and July, respectively. The efficiency of the solar to electric was around 8% and was in good agreement with the findings in the literature. The results for the solar cogeneration system can serve as an evaluation reference for the application of solar thermal system in the moderate solar radiation localities in Malaysia.

AB As a promising technique to reduce the in-cylinder temperature and exhaust temperature, mitigate combustion knock, improve combustion phasing and decrease NOx emissions, water injection applied on different types of engines has attracted extensive attention in recent years to further improve fuel economy and fulfill stricter emission regulations. Since mechanisms of water injection with different aims are distinct, benefits on engine performances and emissions are also varied. This paper intends to give a comprehensive review of water injection applied on the internal combustion engine. First, different implementations of water injection are introduced, followed by a detailed description of water evaporation processes. Second, mechanisms of the in cylinder combustion process with water addition are discussed with respect to the heat release rate, knock tendency and emission formations. Next, recent works of water injection applied on different kinds of engines are reviewed with special attentions given to the comparisons of different implementations and injection parameters. Furthermore, comparisons and combinations of water injection with other advanced engine techniques are summarized. Finally, critical issues of current research on the water injection technique are discussed.

AB To valorize oleaginous Schizochytrium sp. biomass, a novel sequential process was addressed and developed to simultaneously produce high value DHA-enriched glycerides and low value bulky biodiesels. In this process, Schizochytrium sp. biomass was first treated by alkaline protease; then the resulting biomass was directly subjected to enzymatic ethanolysis catalyzed by liquid enzymes from C. antarctica (CALA), T. lanuginosus (TL), R. miehei (RM) and A. oryzae (PLA). For all four liquid lipases, the alkaline protease treatment on Schizochytrium sp. biomass significantly enhanced total lipid recovery, biodiesel yield and yield of DHA-enriched glycerides. Under optimized conditions, CALA and TL achieved the highest biodiesel yields 76.28-76.66 wt% based on microalgae TFAs while PLA had the lowest (55.25 wt%). Moreover, CALA attained the highest DHA (77.93 wt%) and LC PUFAs (93.08 wt%) contents in glyceride fraction, suggesting a superior performance to concentrate DHA and LC PUFAs in glycerides. C-13 NMR analysis illustrated that non-regiospecificity and unfavorability towards LC PUFAs of CALA made it possible to transesterify saturated fatty acids located in all 3 positions of microalgal oil; thus LC PUFAs were highly enriched in glycerides. Overall, the sequential process using enzymes and ethanol as green media was successfully established for the co-production of high-value microalgal bioproducts rich in LC PUFAs and sustainable biodiesels in a comprehensive manner.

AB The main aim is to investigate the effects of Ca/Na compounds on coal pyrolysis, gasification reactivity as well as char characteristics during gasification. The pyrolysis and gasification tests of different metal loaded coals were performed on thermogravimetric analyzer and fixed bed reactor. The raw and gasified chars were prepared and characterized by nitrogen adsorption, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results indicate that Ca coexist with Na has a better catalytic activity compared to Ca and Na alone. The addition of metals can promote the pyrolysis gas release in advance and increase the release amount of H-2 and CO2. The present of Ca/Na compounds have no significant effect on pore structure evolution during pyrolysis, but it inhibits the aromatic structure condensation of the coal char. The addition of Na and Ca is beneficial to the formation of micropores and mesopores respectively during gasification, the simultaneous existence of Ca and Na results in a more abundant pore structure. Both Ca and Na can inhibit the condensation of aromatic structures during coal char gasification, Ca together with Na will make the char has a higher degree of disorder. The interaction between Ca and Na with coal char makes the carbon matrix easier to be attacked by H2O to form more active intermediates. Redox experiments further verified that more active intermediates were generated during the gasification of Ca/Na loaded char.

AB Annular thermoelectric generators can eliminate the thermal contact resistance formed due to geometry mismatch when flat-plate thermoelectric generators are used with round shaped heat source or heat sink. Therefore, in this study, the numerical simulation of a segmented annular thermoelectric generator (SATEG) is investigated using three-dimensional finite element analysis. The thermoelectric and mechanical performance of the segmented annular thermoelectric generator is studied by considering temperature dependent thermoelectric material properties and elastoplastic behaviour of copper and the welding layer (solder). The influence of segmented pin geometry on the performance of the segmented annular thermoelectric generator is investigated and comparison is made with non-segmented annular thermoelectric generators. COMSOL 5.3 Multiphysics software is used to investigate the effects of heat source temperature, thermoelectric leg length and leg angle on the electrical and mechanical performance of the segmented and non-segmented annular thermoelectric generators. Results show that the segmented annular thermoelectric generator has a greater efficiency compared to the annular thermoelectric generator (ATEG) with Bismuth telluride material when the temperature difference is greater than 100 K. In addition, the efficiency of the SATEG is found to be 21.7% and 82.9% greater than that of the Bismuth telluride ATEG and Skutterudite ATEG respectively at 200 K temperature difference. Finally, the results show that increase in thermoelectric leg length can reduce the thermal stress and electrical performance of the segmented and non-segmented thermoelectric generators. Results obtained from this study would influence the design and optimization of segmented annular thermoelectric generators.

AB The combination of hydraulic fracturing and depressurization method has been proposed to enhance gas production efficiency from methane hydrate (MH) reservoirs. To evaluate the efficacy of this method, we construct a fractured MH reservoir model and investigate by means of numerical simulation the gas production behaviors under two different temperature conditions. The simulation results indicate that the combination of hydraulic fracturing and depressurization method is more efficient for gas production than the single depressurization method. For the high-temperature reservoir, the hydrate dissociation and gas production during the early depressurization stage can be significantly enhanced after fracturing, and the effect of increasing the size and permeability of the fractured zone on gas production rate is more remarkable in the early depressurization stage than in the late depressurization stage. For the low-temperature reservoir, while the improvement in hydrate dissociation and gas production by fracturing is dramatic during the entire depressurization period, the increment in total gas production is very low in absolute terms. In addition, gas production from low-temperature reservoir is very sensitive to initial temperature, and increasing the reservoir temperature can enhance the benefits of fracturing.

AB Waste frying oils (WFO) are a promising source in terms of feedstock for biodiesel production, and have a lower cost than the typical refined vegetable oils. In addition, the use of WFO is an environmentally correct way to use this residue; it also decreases the food versus fuel competition. However, the application of WFO has some limitations, including their high free fatty acid and water content, which influences the final ester yield in the base catalyzed reactions. This review article introduces a state-of-the-art use of WFO as feedstock for biodiesel production. Here, catalytic and non-catalytic methods are reported and discussed, and the advantages and disadvantages of using WFO are presented. Furthermore, techniques for the purification of biodiesel are discussed along with patents and potential future work available in terms of production and purification.

   MODEL; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; OPTIMIZATION
AB The optical efficiency of the solar receiver is important to the global efficiency of the solar power tower plant. However, the present commercial cylindrical receiver causes a considerable optical loss because most of the sunrays reflected by the receiver surface are lost to the environment. To improve optical efficiency, three novel receivers with vertical finned structures and two novel receivers with horizontal finned structures are proposed in this paper. The optimal configurations of these receivers are obtained after parametric optimization. The optical efficiency and solar fluxes distributions of the optimal novel receivers are compared with those of the traditional cylindrical receiver at the noon of spring equinox. The results show that there is an optimal fin number of 6 for all the receivers with vertical finned structures. The receiver with vertical finned structures and the flat bottom shows the maximal optical efficiency of 63.9%. It indicates an improvement of 3.2 percentage points compared with that of the traditional cylindrical receiver. The receiver with horizontal fins with flat bottom shows the minimal optical efficiency of 60.3% at the noon of the spring equinox. It indicates a decrease of 0.4 percentage points compared with that of the traditional cylindrical receiver. Additionally, the peak solar fluxes on the novel receivers are quite close to each other and are nearly double that of the traditional cylindrical receiver. In the end, a multi-point aiming strategy is applied to the optimal novel receivers, and the results show that the peak fluxes can be obviously reduced. It is concluded that optical efficiency can be effectively improved by using the receivers with vertical finned structures.

AB In this study, a new V-corrugated absorber with multi-channels is presented and applied in the liquid flat-plate solar collector. The absorber is extruded with aluminium and specific triangular channels are directly formed to improve the solar absorptance, reduce the heat conduction thermal resistance and decrease the pressure drop. Optical and heat transfer models for the new collector and a conventional sheet-and-tube collector are developed and experiments are carried out to validate the accuracy. Performance of the new and conventional collector are compared under different operational conditions and the results indicate that: (i) The daily average optical/ thermal efficiency of the new and conventional collector are about 84.9%/69.4% and 69.1%/58.6%, respectively. (ii) The average exergy efficiency of the new and conventional collector are about 3.8% and 3.3% respectively under the mass flow rate of 10-90 g/s. (iii) The pressure drop and pump power consumption of the conventional collector are about 4.1 times higher than those of the new collector. The designing of V-corrugated absorber can improve the collector optical and thermal efficiency, and reduce the pressure drop and pump power consumption significantly, but exerts little effect on the exergy efficiency. Notwithstanding so, the performance improvement potential of the V-corrugated absorber is huge and the designing and manufacturing of the collector can be further developed.

AB In the present study, an innovative cascade absorption refrigeration (CAR) system for recovering low-grade waste heat is proposed. Based on the simulation results, the energy, exergy and economic (3E) analyses of the cascade refrigeration system have been conducted. The analysis results show that there is a contradiction between economic performance and thermodynamic performance. Then, the optimization scheme aiming at total exergy destruction (EDt), the optimization scheme aiming at total annual cost (C-t) and multi-objective optimization scheme (C-t and E-Dt) are optimized by non-dominated sort genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) technology. EDt is 11% more than its minimum result in the optimization scheme aiming at total annual cost, which shows that the thermal performance of the scheme is poor. C-t is 14.8% more than its minimum result in the optimization scheme aiming at total exergy destruction, which shows that the scheme is not economical. C-t and EDt are only 5.9% and 4.5% respectively higher than their minimum results in the multi-objective optimization scheme. Therefore, multi-objective optimization scheme is the most comprehensive and optimal scheme of the CAR system.

AB The necessity to decarbonise the transportation sector has triggered the exploration of alternative cleaner fuels that can successfully substitute fossil derived fuels. Dimethyl ether (DME) poses as a promising candidate due to excellent combustion properties and low greenhouse gas emissions. Recently, the power to liquids (PtL) concept in conjunction with the carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) scenario have emerged as sustainable ways to produce carbon based material and contribute into satisfying the ever growing energy demand. In view of these, the goal of the present study is to determine the technical performance and economic viability of a novel di methyl ether (DME) production route via captured CO2 hydrogenation within a power to liquid context. Mass and energy balances were solved and integrated by means of simulations using Aspen Plus V10 and Matlab R2017b software. Based on a plant that produces roughly 740 tonnes of DME per day, the global energy efficiency of the proposed process configuration is equal to 44.4% while the overall achieved CO2 conversion to DME is 82.3%. A typical discounted cash flow analysis revealed that the deterministic minimum DME selling price (MDSP) is 2193 (sic) t(-1) (or equally 75.62 (sic) GJ(-1)); this figure is approximately 5-fold greater than the gate price of conventional diesel. The factors that mostly affect the MDSP are associated with the electrolysis unit, i.e. electricity price as well as electrolyser efficiency and capital cost. Changes in the renewable energy price cause wide fluctuations in the DME market price of -70% to + 21%. Finally, stochastic uncertainty analysis, based on Monte Carlo simulations, exposed a 95% confidence interval for the MDSP to be within the range of 1828-2322(sci) t(-1).

AB In this paper, a new ammonia-water based combined heating and power (CHP) system that combines a superheated Kalina cycle and a compression heat pump cycle is proposed to provide power and hot air simultaneously for users. In the system, large amounts of energy remained in the ammonia-poor liquid exhausted from the separator of Kalina cycle is recovered by the compression heat pump cycle. Firstly the superiority of superheated Kalina cycle to basic Kalina cycle is demonstrated in order to introduce the proposed CHP system. Then the mathematical models of the CHP system are established for simulation and analysis. An exergy loss analysis for the system under a preliminary design operation condition shows that the largest two parts of exergy destructions of equipment occur in vapor generator and heat supplier. Finally a thermodynamic parameter analysis is carried out and the results reveal that there exists an optimal high pressure of system that yields the maximal system exergy efficiency. Within certain ranges, lower middle pressure of system and separation temperature, higher low pressure of system and ammonia mass fraction of basic solution, would reach higher system exergy efficiencies. The turbine inlet temperature just has a little effect on the system exergy efficiency.

AB Compared to conventional closed absorption cycles, the open absorption cycle has a greater potential in latent heat recovery from exhausted moist gas since it recovers latent heat by mass transfer instead of heat transfer. Existing open absorption cycles including single-effect and multi-stage cycles have limitations on the waste heat utilization. This paper suggests a novel variable-stage open absorption heat pump cycle which can work on a wide range of temperature and humidity of exhaust gas. A membrane contactor is also suggested to replace traditional direct-contact absorbers to integrate with the new cycle. The membrane contactor has a higher mass and heat transfer efficiency and a greater potential to avoid solution carryover. Thermodynamic model of the new cycle combined with the membrane absorber model is developed. Parametric analysis is carried out to evaluate the performance of the new cycle. Simulation results show that, under the analyzed conditions, the equivalent stage number of the new cycle varies from 4 to 1 while coefficient of performance increases approximately from 1.2 to 2 with the increase of generation temperature and air humidity ratio. It indicates that the new cycle can cover the working temperature or humidity ranges of at least four conventional absorption cycles, including single-stage, 1.5-stage, double-stage, triple-stage absorption cycles. The new cycle works on a much wider temperature and humidity ranges than conventional multi-stage cycles because the pressures of the low-pressure generator and absorber will adjust themselves to adapt to the variations of generation temperature and air humidity ratio. The self-adaption of the pressures of the low-pressure generator and absorber is realized by the control of the solution mass flow rate. During the evaluated working ranges, coefficient of performance of the new cycle increases by 5.9-28.2% compared to conventional multi-stage absorption cycles. Influences of the operating conditions on the absorption rate of the membrane absorber is also conducted and discussed.

AB In order to study the most economical way of heating the buildings, considering the effect of the bilateral load demands on the way of heating the buildings, a novel solar photovoltaic/thermal assisted gas engine driven energy storage heat pump system (SESGEHPs) is presented which can meet the demands of the real-time building heating load and lower temperature heat source of evaporator to ensure the PV/T system works in the optimum temperature range. A test bench of SESGEHPs is set up and the experiments are carried out to test the system heating performance, including the characteristics of the PV/T system, ESGEHPs, building heating load and environmental parameters. The experimental results show that the average COP and PER of the SESGEHPs is nearly 24.5% and 20.4% higher than the ESGEHPs, respectively. The fuel-consumption and the average compressor power consumption of SESGEHPs is nearly 7.5% and 24.0% lower than the ESGEHPs, respectively. Finally, the experimental data are processed using the generalized regression neural network (GRNN) to get the relationship between the independent variable (solar radiation, outdoor dry bulb temperature and wind speed) and dependent variable (the building heating load, heating capacity of the SESGEHPs, heat-obtained quantity and power generation of the PV/T system). It is found that the operating characteristics of the SESGEHPs are greatly affected by the solar radiation and the outdoor temperature, and less affected by the wind speed.

AB The paper describes the preparation of Ni/xLa-SEP catalysts selected low-cost clay minerals as support that possess high catalytic performance for steam reforming of phenol-ethanol (SRPE) to sustainably produce hydrogen. The catalysts were characterized using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICPOES), N-2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), H-2 pulse chemisorption, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H-2-TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results demonstrated that the addition of La reduced the active metal size and increased the active metal surface of the Ni/SEP catalyst. The Ni/10La-SEP catalyst exhibited the smallest active metal size (5 +/- 0.5 nm) and highest active metal surface area (12.7 m(2)/g(nat),). As expected, Ni/10La-SEP presented the highest carbon conversion and H-2 yield (92.1 and 87.6%, respectively) during SRPE reactions. Moreover, the La addition enhanced the steam reforming (SR) of CH4 and water-gas shift (WGS) reactions and successfully suppressed the sintering and coking of the Ni/SEP catalyst.

AB Dual-mode dual-fuel combustion stands as one of the promising techniques to allow the dual-fuel operation along the whole engine map. This concept relies on using different combustion strategies as reactivity controlled compression ignition up to medium load, then migrating to diffusive dual-fuel combustion to reach full load. With this strategy, it is possible to obtain sensible reductions in NOx and soot while providing improvements in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. However, the excessive quantities of HC and CO together with the low exhaust temperature can compromise the diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) efficiency. In addition, the diffusive dual-fuel combustion applied at high engine load produces considerable soot amounts that should be reduced within the diesel particulate filter (DPF).
   Based on these facts, this work intends to evaluate the efficiency of a commercial aftertreatment system (DOC + DPF) while operating in dual-mode dual-fuel combustion. Additionally, fundamental studies where developed to understand the impact of the combination of fuels on the exhaust hydrocarbon species. First, the DOC performance was evaluated at steady-state and transient conditions under different operating conditions fulfilling the EUVI NOx and soot limits. In parallel, the different engine-out hydrocarbon species were measured by means of a Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) gas analyzer. Finally, the passive and active regeneration processes were assessed by means of different methodologies aiming to evaluate the low NOx-low soot interaction and the capability of the active regeneration in dual-fuel dual-mode (DMDF) operating conditions. The DOC results showed an improper conversion efficiency at low load operating condition, where the exhaust temperature is low. By contrast, the thermal inertia at transient conditions allowed to improve the DOC behavior at low load, reaching DOC-out emissions one order of magnitude lower than those from the steady-state tests. Concerning the DPF, it was demonstrated that the low concentration of NOx and soot produced during the combustion does not lead to sensible changes in the NO2/NOx ratio before and after the DPF, indicating a low level/absence of passive regeneration. In the case of the active regeneration, both conventional diesel combustion (CDC) and DMDF operating conditions can obtain satisfactory reduction in the total soot trapped, being the increase in the exhaust temperature consequence of the HC and CO conversion the supporting mechanism for the active regeneration in the DMDF concept.

TI Robust optimization for the preliminary design of solar organic Rankine
   cycle (ORC) systems
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID WORKING FLUIDS; THERMOECONOMIC ANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS; SELECTION
AB Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) powered by solar energy is a viable and effective option for a high efficiency conversion of solar thermal energy into electricity at a distributed scale but recurring fluctuations of the thermal energy often force solar-based ORC systems to operate at part-load conditions.
   With the aim of including the effects of the expected variations of the heat source and heat sink characteristics, even during the design phase, a novel optimization approach for the preliminary design of ORC systems integrated with concentrating solar collectors is presented and analysed. In particular, the minimization of the expected levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of the ORC unit is chosen as an objective function, while the generation of various scenarios is proposed to face the expected fluctuations on the heat source mass flow rate and temperature and cooling inlet temperature. In this way, the expected off-design performances are involved during the design step, giving robustness to the optimal design solution.
   The proposed methodology is tested by referring to the solar ORC system configuration of the Ottana solar facility. Firstly, the effect of a robust optimization on the preliminary ORC design is investigated by considering an increased number of scenarios for each of the three most significant ORC input variables (heat source mass flow rate and temperature and ambient temperature). Subsequently, the proposed methodology was applied to an ORC design case by considering a concurrent variation of the three variables and three different working fluids.
   The results of this study demonstrate that a multi-scenario approach drives towards an ORC configuration with lower performance under design conditions, but less sensitive to the variation of the main inputs. Less expensive solutions are therefore achieved by the proposed methodology, but the annual energy production obtained is comparable with those achieved by adopting a single scenario approach, with a consequent reduction of the LCOE.

AB Recent years have seen a sharp increase in the range and implementation of solar energy conversion systems, with the goal of reducing fossil fuel dependence. One example is a concentrated photovoltaic-thermal (CPV-T) system that uses nanofluid-based optical filters, which can generate electricity and absorb heat from sunlight. Although spectral filtering CPV-T systems have been explored in the literature for power generation, they have not been investigated for domestic applications. In this work, dynamic simulations of a small-scale spectral filtering CPV-T system under the climatic conditions of Tucson, Arizona, are performed. The long-term simulations indicate that the proposed CPV-T system can offset a total of 1.317 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year per household. If implemented in 10% of the households in the U.S., the total offset by the proposed system would be equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions from 3.19 million passenger vehicles per year.

AB The operating conditions of coal gasifier have significant effects on the overall system performance of an associated process. This study designs a methanol-electricity polygeneration system and presents a comprehensive discussion about the effects of the ratio of steam to coal, the ratio of O-2 to coal, the ratio of carrier gas (CO2) to coal and the CO2 concentration in methanol synthesis gas on different performance indicators. The results show that the steam/coal ratio has slight effects on the overall system performance due to the offset in different sections. An optimal O-2/coal ratio exists in the range of 0.84-0.86 to achieve the minimum unit water consumption and the maximum methanol production and energy efficiency, which is almost consistent with the range that the H-2 concentration in gasifier syngas reaches the maximum value. The amount of carrier gas CO2 and the CO2 concentration in methanol synthesis gas should be kept at a low level to just meet the requirements of coal pressurization and synthesis reaction. This comprehensive sensitivity analysis can provide some significant guidance for the system design.

AB Forest-based biofuel is a promising solution to increase the share of renewable and sustainable energy in the transportation sector. Large-scale implementation of biofuel, however, not only affects the energy and transportation sectors, but also the forest sector value chains. This study uses a partial equilibrium forest sector model to quantify how large-scale production of forest-based biofuel would affect forest owners and forest industries in the Nordic countries. In a scenario assuming that forest-based biofuels cover a 0-40% share of the current Nordic road transportation and domestic aviation fuel consumption, the model results show that the sawmill industry increases their profit slightly due to increasing prices for their sawmilling residues. The traditional pulp and paper industries, on the other hand, see a reduced profit by up to 3.0 billion (sic), corresponding to 8% of their annual turnover, due to the increase in the price of pulpwood. Due to the increasing wood prices, the forest owners benefit significantly from biofuel investments. According to the model, their gross revenue from harvesting increases up to 31% without the need to increase the harvest more than 15%. The overall profit in the traditional forest sector is reduced by 400-600 million E. The decrease in profit is largest when the biofuel production volume covers 20%-30% of the liquid fuels in the Nordic countries. The reduction in overall profit is lower at 40% biofuel implementation, owing to the significant increase in revenue for the forest owner and the fact that the main reduction in pulp and paper industries happens at between 0% and 30% biofuel implementation. The study shows substantial economic spill-over effects from large-scale biofuel implementations to other parts of the forest sector.

AB An innovative solar thermal power generation system using cascade steam-organic Rankine cycle (SORC) and two-stage accumulators has recently been proposed. This system offers a significantly higher heat storage capacity than conventional direct steam generation (DSG) solar power plants. The steam condensation temperature (T-2) in the proposed system is a crucial parameter because it affects the SORC efficiency (eta(SORC)) in normal operations and the power conversion of the bottoming organic Rankine cycle (ORC) in the unique heat discharge process. The present study develops a methodology for the design of T-2 with respect to a new indicator, that is, the equivalent heat-to-power efficiency (72,9). neg is a compromise between the efficiencies in different operation modes. The effects of main steam temperature (T-1), Baumann factor (a), mass of storage water (M-w), and ORC working fluid on T-2 are investigated. Results show that neg is a better indicator than eta(SORC). The optimum steam condensation temperature (T-2,T-opt) that corresponds to the maximum eta(eq) (eta(eq,max)) is generally higher than that based on the maximum eta(SORC), T-2,T-opt, reduces as T-1, a, and M-w decrease. eta(eq,max) rises with the increment of T-1 and the decrement of a and M-w. Pentane is a more preferable ORC fluid than benzene and R245fa. The T-2,T-opt and eta(eq,max) of pentane are, respectively, 139-190 degrees C and 20.93%-24.24%, provided that T-1 ranges between 250 degrees C and 270 degrees C, a varies from 0.5 to 1.5, and M-w changes from 500 ton to 1500 ton.

AB Gurney Flaps (GFs) can enhance the aerodynamic performance of airfoils, making them generate more lift and delaying the onset of stall. Since their potential was discovered in the early '70 s, GFs have been applied in several fields, including wind turbines. Here, the research has been focused mostly on the use of GFs in Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWTs), whereas a lack of studies involving the application of these devices on Darrieus Vertical-Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) is apparent in the literature. The benefits induced by GFs could actually be particularly interesting for this type of wind turbines, which are presently receiving a renewed attention from the industry.
   In the present work, an extended numerical analysis using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was carried out with the aim of evaluating the potential of using Gurney Flaps for the power augmentation of Darrieus wind turbines.
   After a validation of the numerical approach using wind tunnel experimental data on a static airfoil, the simulations have assessed the impact of different GF mounting and height on board airfoils moving in the cycloidal motion typical of Darrieus wind turbines. The results on a single rotating airfoil allowed the analysis to highlight the physical phenomena taking place past the rotating blades, including the delay of stall and the modifications induced on the surrounding flow field; power enhancements higher than 20% were shown for some configurations. Then, impact of GFs on a real three-blade turbine was analyzed. The best configuration resulted in a 2%c GF installed in the inner side of the airfoil, so to have a better torque extraction in the downwind half of the revolution. The GF benefits were apparent especially at lower tip-speed ratios, suggesting its use both for newly-designed turbines and even as a retrofitting solution in existing rotors.

AB This paper presents the thermodynamic analysis of an organic Rankine cycle integrated with the cascaded closed loop cycle that is considered one of the advanced heat recovery technologies that enhance thermal efficiency significantly as compared to the simple cycle and the recuperated cycle. A parametric study is performed to investigate the influences of several important operating parameters on energy and exergy efficiencies of all three cycles while using propane as a working fluid. In order to check the accuracy and applicability of the models and validate them with the literature data, a comparison is drawn between the three cycles in terms of net power output, energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, and total exergy destroyed. The results reveal that the net power output of the cascaded cycle shows a significant increase of 73% as compared to the simple cycle. The cascaded cycle shows a promising increase in energy efficiency by 8%, while the exergy efficiency is enhanced by approximately 21%. Total exergy destroyed is reduced by 27% while applying the cascaded technology. The optimization study on the stream mass flow ratio reveals that the maximum energy and exergy performance obtained at the maximum stream mass flow ratio of unity. The study suggests using the cascaded cycle if the heat source temperature is higher than 200 degrees C.

AB Ecological areas visits require appropriate management of key ecological features. In protected reserves innovative systems should be developed to facing problems of pollution, exhaust fumes and noise. These underlying conditions lead to special challenges for excursions ships. The switching to a cleaner, safer and quieter transport system seems to be a sustainable long-term solution for the problems of ecological areas, where more electric ship can be an important part of the solution and principally for the last mile. This paper presents a design approach of a hybrid Energy Storage Systems (ESS) for new generation of series hybrid excursion ship devoted to ecological areas to avoid any emission during the casting-off and the docking maneuvers. The main purpose of the paper is to show that, even if the hybrid ESS plus series-hybrid propulsion were already used to other vehicles, the gain for a ship with no regenerative capability is not evident. The proposed hybridization is built upon a fully-active parallel topology with battery and supercapacitors. The sizing methodology and the configuration of the ESS are detailed. For a real mission profile in Alster Lake (Hamburg, Germany) it is shown that a small battery pack of 2 kWh with a supercapacitor bank of 0.54 kWh are necessary to have zero-emission maneuvers. The graphical formalism Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) is used to describe the model and to establish an energy analysis tool. An inversion-based control scheme is then deduced from the EMR and simulation results are provided to validate the proposed methodology. The usage of hybrid ESS avoids 1.39 kg of CO2 during the casting-off and docking maneuvers despite increasing consumption of 0.2 l (+8%). However, the plug-in capability can be introduced and a recharge of the battery when the ship is docked could reduce the global consumption and emissions by 20% in comparison to the original ship.

AB The present study experimentally quantified the pyrolysis behaviors of waste tea (WT) as a function of four heating rates using thermogravimetric-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses. The maximum weight loss of WT (66.79%) occurred at the main stage of devolatilization between 187.0 and 536.5 degrees C. The average activation energy estimates of three sub-stages of devolatilization were slightly higher (161.81, 193.19 and 224.99 kJ/mol, respectively) by the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa than Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose method. Kinetic reaction mechanisms predicted using the master-plots were f (alpha) = (3/2)(1 - alpha)(2/3)[1 - (1 - alpha)(1/3)](-1), f (alpha) = (1 - alpha)(2), and f (alpha) = (1 - alpha)(2.5) for the three sub-stages, respectively. The prominent volatiles of the WT pyrolysis were CO2 > C=O > phenol > CH4 > CO > NH3 > H2O > CO. A total of 33 organic compounds were identified including alkene, acid, benzene, furan, ketone, phenol, nitride, alcohol, aldehyde, alkyl, and ester. This study provides a theoretical and practical guideline to meeting the engineering challenges of introducing WT residues in the bioenergy sector.

AB An experimental investigation and numerical verification of the transient behavior of a hybrid concentrating triple junction solar cell-thermoelectric generator system is presented in this paper. The experimental work is accomplished under varying concentrated solar radiations using a solar simulator, and the numerical study is conducted using COMSOL Multiphysics Modeling Software. An arbitrary pattern for the solar radiation varying between 0 and 39 suns is considered in the experiments and numerical simulation. Time-dependent temperatures of the concentrating triple junction solar cell and hot and cold sides of the thermoelectric generator along with short circuit current, open circuit voltage and maximum powers are obtained experimentally. The results indicate that the output power by the concentrating triple junction solar cell is fluctuating very fast with changing the solar radiation. Due to the thermal capacity and thermal resistance of the thermoelectric generator, this variation for the temperatures and output power of the thermoelectric generator is more gradually. The results also indicate that using thermoelectric generator in the hybrid system leads to having more stable overall output power. Furthermore, the contribution of the thermoelectric generator in the overall power generation by the system can be enhanced with material and geometrical optimization.

AB The impetus of the internal combustion engine developments is the reductions of the fuel consumptions and exhaust emissions. Thermal management is an efficient method to decrease the exhaust emissions and enhance fuel economy. In order to further optimize the thermal management of internal combustion engines, a detailed analysis of the energy flow in each component of internal combustion engines is indispensable. In this paper, the test bench of a heavy duty diesel engine was established to obtain the target parameters. The energy distributions in each component of the diesel engine, including compressor, intercooler, shaft power, turbine, coolant and exhaust, were calculated using tested parameters. The lubricating oil consumption was also taken into consideration. In addition, the potential influences of different turbochargers on the total thermal efficiency were analyzed. The results showed that the thermal efficiency of the diesel engine was more than 38% when the engine operated at 50%100% engine load and 1000 rpm1700 rpm conditions. The energy loss by coolant was more than 50% of the total fuel energy consumption in the low power output conditions. However, it was lower than 30% in high power output conditions, and the thermal loss was more than 150 kW around rated power conditions. The maximum proportion of the energy being consumed by turbine was ?10% of the fuel energy; additionally, the exhaust energy distributions changed significantly after the turbine expansion. 1%3% of the fuel energy was recycled by the turbocharger, then, flowed into the cylinders. The energy loss through the intercooler accounted for ?6% of the fuel energy. Significant reductions of exhaust emissions and fuel consumptions can be achieved by optimizing the coolant and lubricating oil thermal conditions. Turbochargers presented a huge effect on exhaust temperature distributions at high power output conditions, and the total thermal efficiency changed significantly if all kinds of energy recovery approaches were applied.

AB A novel adsorber design combining fin-coating and filling of granules between the fins is introduced for closed sorption thermal energy storage. A storage system is designed and assembled, experimental results are presented for charging and discharging, heating and cooling. Considering the use case of the thermal management of the battery in a hybrid vehicle, a total cooling energy of 544(8) Wh in a period of 30 min is measured, which gives an average cooling power of 1.05(8) kW. A novel hybrid operation mode is proposed for discharging the storage for heating purposes, exploiting the features of both phase-change and thermochemical materials simultaneously by allowing water to freeze in the evaporator. The freezing enthalpy can then be exploited as evaporation enthalpy, removing the need for an external low-temperature heat source for the evaporator. This hybrid operation might be beneficial, e.g. in winter in order to preheat the battery before discharging it.

AB A micro-chemical plant implies the production increment of a determined product using micro/millireactor disposed in parallel. The flow distributor is responsible for the uniform distribution through these parallel mi-crodevices. A mal-distribution, resulted from inadequate flow distributors designs, decrease the micro-chemical plant performance. Hence, the main goal of this paper was to apply 3D printing in manufacturing micro-chemical plant parts and to obtain data on flow uniformity and reaction yield by experimental tests for the increase of biodiesel production. The methodology consisted of design, printing and assembly of the micro-chemical plant and experimental tests for flow rate and chemical reaction. The nonuniformity flow coefficient (Phi) values were obtained for ethanol, sunflower oil and ethanol-sunflower oil mixture. The conical distributor without obstacle with height of 26 mm (CD26) and the conical distributor with obstacle and height of 52 mm (CDO52) presented excellent performance (Phi < 1%) for ethanol and sunflower oil flow, respectively, being used in the biodiesel synthesis scale-up. In the microplant, the pipes used for oil and ethanol followed length/diameter ratios of 39 and 113, respectively, which offered low pressure drop. The flow uniformity deviation obtained in the micro-plant was 4.2%, and its global yield was 42%, close to a single millireactor operation (50.4%). Thereby, the biodiesel was produced at 126.4 mL min(-1). The developed microplant employed an efficient strategy for bio-diesel scale-up. Another advantage of the methodology described here is the sharing possibility of files or objects over the internet. A user anywhere around the world can access the microplant developed here and start producing the desired chemical using a 3D Printer.

AB The present work explores the potential of an artificial neural network platform to emulate the performance, emissions and stability indices of an existing single cylinder diesel engine operating in dual-fuel mode with methanol port injection under varying fuel injection pressure. This investigation is further augmented by hydrous methanol injection strategies. Brake power, fuel injection pressure, diesel specific fuel consumption, methanol specific fuel consumption, air flow rate, exhaust oxygen and temperature have been chosen as the model inputs while oxides of nitrogen, unburned hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, soot have been chosen as the emission responses to be modelled along with equivalent brake specific fuel consumption as the performance response and coefficient of variance of indicated mean effective pressure as the stability parameter to be estimated. Absolute, relative and percentage-based statistical error metrics have been employed for model evaluation. The developed model shows an excellent agreement with the experimental data as evident from its extremely low normalized mean square error, symmetric mean absolute percentage error, Normalized root mean square error, mean squared relative error footprint coupled with high coefficient of determination which was observed to be within a range of 0.983-0.9999 and a corresponding Nash Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency of 85%-99.6%. Furthermore, low Theil uncertainty evaluation and Kullback-Leibler Divergence values imparted a commendable credence of robustness to the estimation capability of the developed model. The present study manifests a computationally efficient and reliable virtual sensing platform to simultaneously emulate the emission-performance and stability parameters of a diesel-methanol partially premixed dual fuel operational paradigms in real time engine control strategies.

AB There are no models in scientific literature that satisfyingly simulate the behaviour of real Stirling engines, once that performance prediction models estimate errors above 7%, a barrier to be broken in new engine projects. This work presents a methodology that aims not only to reduce the error in the prediction of the indicated power in beta-type Stirling engines, but also to facilitate extrapolation without the necessity of experimental data. For that, strategies are combined to calculate initial and boundary conditions which are used on a transient simulation in computational fluid dynamics. The first-order model of Schmidt allows to calculate the pressure inside the engine exactly when the power piston is on the bottom dead centre with an average error of 21.3%. The temperature on displacer piston faces can be acquired through a steady-state simulation in CFD (without piston movement). In this methodology, the pressure and the temperature profile are respectively used as initial and boundary conditions for a transient simulation in ANSYS(center dot) Fluent, reducing the stabilisation time. The inclusion of the Discrete Ordinates radiation model increases the displacer's frontal face temperature by 132.2 K and results in an indicated power prediction improvement with an error reduction from -14.4% to -2.6% when compared to experimental values. In this way, the presented methodology consists in the combination of first-order mathematical models with CFD simulations, which enables extrapolation for other conditions in beta-type Stirling engines without the necessity of initial and boundary experimental conditions, obtaining an error around -2.6% (2.70 W for experimental and 2.63 W for simulation). Thus, with this methodology, it is possible to design a new project of beta-type Stirling engines through laboratory prototypes enhancing the power accurately.

AB Although new vehicles are designed to comply with specific emission regulations, their in-service performance would not necessarily achieve them due to wear-and-tear and improper maintenance, as well as tampering or failure of engine control and exhaust after-treatment systems. In addition, there is a lack of knowledge on how significantly these potential malfunctions affect vehicle performance. This study was therefore conducted to simulate the effect of various engine malfunctions on the fuel consumption and gaseous emissions of a 16-tonne Euro VI diesel truck using transient chassis dynamometer testing. The simulated malfunctions included those that would commonly occur in the intake, fuel injection, exhaust after-treatment and other systems. The results showed that all malfunctions increased fuel consumption except for the malfunction of EGR fully closed which reduced fuel consumption by 31%. The biggest increases in fuel consumption were caused by malfunctions in the intake system (16%-43%), followed by the exhaust after-treatment (6%-30%), fuel injection (4%-24%) and other systems (6%-11%). Regarding pollutant emissions, the effect of engine malfunctions on HC and CO emissions was insignificant, which remained unchanged or even reduced for most cases. An exception was EGR fully open which increased HC and CO emissions by 343% and 1124%, respectively. Contrary to HC and CO emissions, NO emissions were significantly increased by malfunctions. The largest increases in NO emissions were caused by malfunctions in the after-treatment system, ranging from 38% (SCR) to 1606% (DPF pressure sensor). Malfunctions in the fuel injection system (24%-1259%) and intercooler (438%-604%) could also increase NO emissions markedly. This study demonstrated clearly the importance of having properly functioning engine control and exhaust after-treatment systems to achieve the required performance of fuel consumption and pollutant emissions.

AB This paper experimentally studies and compares the addition of fins and the addition of metal wool in a latent heat thermal energy storage (TES) system as heat transfer enhancement techniques. Despite the well-known suitability of fins as enhancement technique, their implementation cost in the TES system is one of its main drawbacks. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the potential of adding a cheap and commercially available metallic wool in order to overcome the abovementioned drawback. In particular, four different latent heat TES systems based on the shell-and-tube heat exchanger concept were designed using n-octadecane as phase change material (PCM). One of them was used as a reference, while in the remaining configurations the heat transfer surface was increased by means of seventeen rectangular fins and by means of metallic wool arbitrarily distributed within the PCM and compacted in a finned shape. Charging and discharging processes with constant heat transfer fluid temperature and flow rate were evaluated from the temperature and heat transfer points of view. Results were focused on the metal wool because is a cheap and handmade solution which can be implemented in an already made heat exchanger. The addition of metal wool showed an enhancement, during the charge, higher than 10% when it was arbitrarily distributed, while compacting the metal wool in a finned shape showed practically no improvement. During the discharge, both metal wool configurations allowed minimal improvements.

AB The present paper presents an assessment of the techno-economic performance of novel polygeneration concepts for bio-oil production. They are based on catalytic hydropyrolysis and hydrodeoxygenation, and can be integrated with other processes for co-production of synthetic natural gas, molecular hydrogen and methanol. Thirteen system layouts were evaluated considering different technological alternatives and process pathways. Firstly, detailed thermodynamic and economic models were developed to calculate and compare the energy demands, capital and production costs of all plants, given a biomass input of 2000 dry metric tonnes per day. Sensitivity analyses using local approaches, Morris screening and multi-variable linear regression tools were then conducted to identify the essential parameters. Finally, uncertainty analyses were performed to estimate the minimum selling price of bio-oil for each case. The results show that the total capital costs range between $180 and $620 million, for a production cost between $17 and $24 per GJ of fuel. The feedstock and electricity costs represent the greatest share (up to 60% together) followed by the annualised investment costs (up to 18%). The sensitivity analyses suggest that the plant profitability is mostly impacted by the bio-oil yield, by-product characteristics, electrolysis costs, wood and power prices. The uncertainty analysis, through Monte-Carlo simulations, demonstrates that the minimum fuel selling prices may vary from $-3 to $240 per GJ. The most promising layouts are those with SNG and H-2 production, whilst the riskiest ones are those with electrolysis.

AB Harvesting electrical energy from various human motions using piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEH) is gaining research attention in recent years. The energy harvested could potentially power hand held electronic devices and medical devices without the need of external power source for recharging batteries. In this study, an attempt is made to improve the efficiency of PEH to harvest energy from human motions by adopting a double pendulum system coupled with magnetic force interactions. For the purpose of comparison, three configurations of PEH which includes the conventional PEH with cantilever beam (PEHCB), the PEH with single pendulum system (PEHSP) and the PEH with double pendulum system (PEHDP) are experimentally studied. Excitations by both mechanical shaker and major human body parts during walking and jogging motions are investigated. The performance of each configuration, in terms of voltage and power produced as well as the idle time between each cycle, are analysed, compared and discussed. ANSYS software is used to analyse the proposed model and MATLAB software is used to calculate the output power. The results demonstrate that, with the use of the proposed double pendulum system, multiple impacts in each motion cycle is generated, thus producing higher voltage and power as compared to the conventional PEHCB. The idle time between each motion cycle is also effectively reduced. The efficiency of the PEH is thus significantly increased.

AB Linear Fresnel power plants are currently one of the most promising concentrating solar power plants. However there are only a few commercial projects. These power plants have a lower efficiency than parabolic trough collector plants and are still expensive. To increase the efficiency of these plants, the utilization of water/steam in the receivers (direct steam generation, DSG) and thermal storage (TES) have been considered.
   As case study, a 50 MWe solar-only linear Fresnel power plant located in Seville, Spain is considered. The effects of the solar field size and the thermal storage size on the annual production of the plant are analyzed: Nine different solar field sizes and up to eight thermal storage sizes have been compared.
   An economic optimization is presented in order to determine which plant has lowest Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE). It has been found that for the power plants with no-storage the optimum solar multiple (SM) is 1.7, whereas for the cases with thermal storage, the optimum configuration is a larger solar field (SM = 2), with a thermal storage of 2 h.

AB Along with the chic fad energy industry field, the graphene application in energy conversion and management does bring about some benefits in terms of the energy transfer and storage development, the achievement it exerts on the multifaceted innovate approaches. Both current and previous studies on energy conversion, energy storage and energy transfer development, many research results are sufficient to show that all graphene products including graphene paper, film, foam and fiber have a significant role in improving performance. In the energy conversion research on the graphene paper, it has been recently demonstrated that putting the graphene into triboelectric nanogenerators practice possesses higher output performance than traditional generator, which has a maximum strain as large as 200% without evident degradation of the electrical properties. In terms of energy transfer, the graphene fiber application on the battery can significantly increase the charge and discharge rates with enhanced storage capacity of 763 F g(-1). On the energy storage research, the graphene foam can enhance a high density of solar thermal storage up to 269.8 kJ kg(-1) for long-term. Nano-graphene and graphene coating provide feasibility for the miniaturization of energy storage equipment which inspired the possibility for portable and foldable devices. The work done in this paper can effectively help promote the application of graphene in energy field. Based on our work, the researchers can choose graphene products (graphene paper, graphene film, graphene foam or graphene fiber) efficiently according to the research object in the future.

AB Flexible piezoelectric nanogenerators have been considered as the most promising candidates in recent years for powering the portable, bendable, and wearable electronics devices by scavenging low frequency biomechanical energy. This work reports an analysis of remarkable output power enhancement of a human-body motion based piezoelectric nanogenerator comprising of self-polarized 2D SnO2 nanosheet/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanocomposite. Structural, mechanical, thermal as well as piezoelectric properties of the composites were studied rigorously, which proved that 5 wt% SnO2 nanosheet/PVDF composite is the most promising one for nanogenerator applications. The inorganic-organic 2D SnO2 nanosheet/PVDF composite based piezoelectric nanogenerators (PSNG) were found to produce outstanding power output due to the gentle human finger imparting with a maximum voltage of 42 V and current density of 6.25 pkcm-2. The output power density of the PSNG reached 4900 W.m(-3) with an efficiency c.a. 16.3%. The obtained output of the reported nanogenerator is in well agreement with the fundamental piezoelectric theory. The improved performance of the self-polarized composite can be attributed to the incorporation of homogeneously distributed 2D SnO2 nanosheets (2D SnO2 NS) having high surface area, which enhances the electroactive beta phase contain in PVDF composites as well as piezoelectric properties. The electrical energy (a.c.) generated from the nanogenerator due to gentle human finger imparting was directly utilized to illuminate 85 numbers commercial LEDs and to charge capacitors rapidly through a bridge rectifier. A hydrophobic 2D SnO2 nanosheet/PVDF composite film (static contact angle of water drop 82.6) was wrapped on the fabricated nanogenerator to attain self-cleaning feature of the PSNG, making the device water and dirt resistive. This work explores a new prospect for self-cleaning Gr-IV oxide/PVDF based high-efficiency, high power density energy harvester scavenging biomechanical energy for realizing next generation flexible self-powered electronics systems.

AB This paper examines the detailed energy and exergy distribution of a 34 cc (cc) air-cooled, two-stroke engine configured to operate on different natural gas (NG) compositions, pure methane, and propane. The engine was developed for application in a small, decentralized combined heat and power (CHP) system. It included optimized intake and exhaust resonators designed from Helmholtz resonance theory to promote effective scavenging. Operation occurred at wide-open-throttle (WOT) at an engine speed of 5400 revolutions per minute (RPM) with low-pressure direct injection (LPDI). Electronic ignition timing was adjusted for maximum brake torque (MBT) while the air-fuel ratio (AFR) was adjusted by injection duration, such that both rich and lean combustion were examined. In addition, start of injection (SOI) was adjusted to balance maximum fuel trapping and combustion stability. Full energy and exergy distribution analyses were completed, as engine operating regimes changed. Exergy was divided into work (available), lost (recoverable), and destructed availabilities. It was found that fuel loss and heat transfer contributed the most to exergy losses, accounting for around 15% and 9% of fuel exergy, respectively. Propane with the highest density, showed the highest in-cylinder trapped energy, heat transfer and, peak utilization factor (UF) of 85.3%. Due to fuel presence in the exhaust, lower 1st law efficiency did not necessarily result into a lower 2nd law efficiency. Higher mixture stratification with propane operation increased carbon monoxide (CO) emissions and hydrogen (H-2) content due to rich operation. CO oxidation could recover up to around 5% and 4% of injected fuel energy as heat for CHP system with propane and NG, respectively. Peak 2nd law efficiencies were around 60.5% while peak 1st law indicated efficiency was around 29%. This discrepancy was due to both exhaust hydrocarbon (HC from fuel slip and incomplete combustion) content, exhaust CO content, and heat loss availabilities.

AB This study proposes a dual heat source integrated heat pump evaporator using solar energy and air energy as the heat sources. Both the refrigerant and water coils were installed and arranged in the evaporator in a certain manner. During the cold season of Xiangtan (China), the heat transfer performance of the integrated heat pump evaporator was studied both experimentally and theoretically (through simulations). The results show that the evaporator's hot water supply can increase the refrigerant's evaporation temperature and heat pump's coefficient of performance (COP). With the increase in average water temperature of evaporator from 14.6 degrees C to 39.5 degrees C, the heat pump's COP increased by 15%. In the simulations conditions, the proportions of the heat released by air and the heat released by hot water are basically the same as the experimental date. Comparing the refrigerant-water refrigerant type evaporator with the water-refrigerant-refrigerant type evaporator, the former is more capable of gaining heat from low temperature water than the latter, and is more conducive to the comprehensive utilization of air and solar energy by heat pump in the cold season. Additionally, the refrigerant-water-refrigerant type evaporator has better anti-frosting capability under lower water temperatures.

AB The use of concentrated solar thermal (CST) to drive endothermic processes, such as supercritical water gasification (SCWG) is an attractive option for green fuel production, and has been demonstrated at laboratory scale. However, there is a lack of understanding of the system-level challenges and economic feasibility of such a technological route. As such, this work is focused on the techno-economic analysis of algae-to-liquid fuel production via solar-driven SCWG-reforming and Fischer Tropsch (FT) processes. A detailed steady-state physical model of the plant is developed in Aspen Plus software. Algae slurry, with 15.2 wt.% concentration of biomass, is considered as the feedstock. The total solar-thermal power delivered to the on-sun gasification and reforming reactors is assumed to be 50 MWth. There is an on-site syngas storage acting as a buffer between the intermittent SCWG-reforming and continuous FT units. The heat exchanger network is optimised for maximum syngas production, and thus liquid fuels including gasoline and diesel. The techno-economic evaluation of the system is carried out for an nth plant design for commercial units considering a plant lifetime of 30 years. The total cost of the plant includes capital investment, (fixed and variable) operating costs as well as a penalty cost for CO2 emissions. With 2016 as the basis year for costing, the proposed system has a levelised cost of fuel (LCOF) as low as 3.2 AUD/L (2.44 USD/L) of gasoline equivalent (at a solar multiple of 3.5 and 15 h syngas storage capacity) with the total capital investment of similar to 160 million AUD, producing 7600 tonnes of fuel per year ( 145 bbl/day) and achieving a capacity factor (CF) of similar to 70%. The sensitivity analysis of economic variables indicates that the feedstock cost, here algae, is the most influential factor, followed by the discount rate, and the capital costs of the FT, the syngas storage and the receiver unit. Although the estimated LCOF in this study seems to be relatively high compared to fossil fuel-based petroleum products, this technology has the prospect of becoming economically competitive in the near future based on the anticipated decrease in the cost of large-scale algae production and CST/FT plant scale-up.

AB Multivariate analysis was used to study the influence of the biomass characteristics on the gasification process. Ten lignocellulosic biomass samples (almond shells -AS-, chestnut sawdust -CHE-, torrefied chestnut sawdust -CHET-, cocoa shells -CS-, grape pomace -GP-, olive stones -OS-, pine cone leafs -PCL-, pine sawdust -PIN-, torrefied pine sawdust -PINT-, and pine kernel shells -PKS-) were gasified in a bubbling fluidized bed gasifier under an air-steam atmosphere. Statistical analysis was applied to the variables that described the results of the gasification process, i.e., gas concentration, gas production (moles), calorific value of the product gas, energy density, and cold gas efficiency, together with the main biomass properties, such as those derived from the elemental and proximate analyses, the higher heating value (HHV), the particle density, and the elemental composition of the ashes. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to the data of biomass properties and gasification parameters in order to elucidate which feedstock features had a more determinant influence on the gasification process. Both HCA and PCA revealed a clear separation of the biomass samples into two main groups on the basis of the gasification results. The results indicated that PKS, PCL, PINT, OS and PIN biomasses were characterized by high production of combustible gases, such as CO and CH4, high conversion and cold gas efficiency during gasification. This indicated that the most important biomass properties for promoting the gas production, calorific value of the product gas, gasification conversion and energy efficiency were the C and H contents and the HHV of the biomass. However, biomasses CS and GP were mainly characterized by high H-2 concentration and H-2/CO molar ratio in the gas product, which was mainly related to the higher H/O ratio and K2O ash content of the biomass. The H-2 concentration in the product gas was negatively related to the O and VM contents of the biomass. Therefore, it can be concluded that the use of multivariate statistical techniques for analyzing gasification data facilitated to draw valuable conclusions about the influence of the biomass properties on the gasification results.

AB A non-imaging concentrator compound by involute and parabolic concentrator was considered in a regenerative organic Rankine cycle (ORC). The concentrator was covered by vacuumed glass tube to reduce heat loss from the absorber, and to extend the effective life-cycle of optical components. Using the non-imaging concentrator can eliminate the necessity of sun tracking system due to its large acceptance angle. A simulation was carried out for low temperature solar thermal electric generation for various working fluids including dry, isentropic and wet fluids. The results showed the best efficiency of concentrator was observed for the case of R-141b and followed by methanol, R-113, water, benzene and cyclohexane, respectively. The best overall system efficiency was seen in the case of R-141b to be 16.7%. The evaporator pressure was changed as a calculation parameter. The best improvement was obtained for water and R-141b to be 8.8% and 8.3%, respectively. R-141b has a preferable performance because of its low boiling point and can be appropriate for small scales. The increase in evaporator pressure persuades the performance improvement for the case of methanol, water and benzene. It proves that these working fluids can be used for larger scale applications with a better thermal performance.

AB The study investigates biodiesel synthesis from waste seeds derived Mesua ferrea oil (MFO) using indigenously developed biocatalyst via lipase immobilisation on coconut shells derived microporous activated carbon (AC). The carbonaceous support was developed through steam activation of carbonised char at optimised activation conditions to attain maximum porous properties. The hydrolytic enzyme i.e. lipase was immobilised on prepared AC through adsorption process at different functional variables. The enzyme loading or uptake of carbonaceous support and enzymatic activity of respective sample at each set of parametric conditions were estimated. The adsorption assisted immobilisation was optimised employing Taguchi method and significant factors affecting highly both the responses were identified through estimation of statistical constraints. The optimised conditions derived using 3FI model were: Initial protein concentration 500 mg/L, time 270 min, temperature 15 degrees C, and solution pH 6 for achieving maximum adsorption capacity of 10.04 mg/g and biodiesel yield 67.5%. Moreover, statistical parameters revealed, immobilisation temperature and initial protein concentration influence the catalytic activity considerably and optimised immobilisation helps in attaining highly active and stable biocatalyst. Furthermore, the chosen model was effective in predicting the optimised conditions with high precision for maximising the responses. Thus, the developed biocatalyst through lipase immobilisation on indigenously prepared microporous carbon support is effective in transesterification of MFO at 3FI model derived optimised conditions.

   PIPELINES
AB A new type of unglazed transpired collector (UTC) incorporating phase change materials (PCMs) is presented. A time-dependent model consisting of eight 1D PDEs is derived from basic principles. Mass, momentum and energy balance equations for air flow are derived ab initio from the general transport theorem for air movement, by including mass sources contribution. Such mass sources terms appear explicitly in the continuity equation but also in the momentum and energy equations. The model has been calibrated in two stages by comparing the computation results with results obtained by measurements. The operation and performance of the UTC is simulated by using realistic meteorological and radiometric data measured during four seasons in Bucharest, Romania (South-Eastern Europe). UTCs incorporating PCMs release heat for a longer time period than usual UTCs (without PCMs) but shorter than that of the systems consisting of UTCs coupled with separate thermal energy storage units. The time variation of the temperature rise Delta T in the UTC decreases when PCMs are incorporated and the effect is stronger in clear sky days than in cloudy and overcast sky days. Also, thicker PCM plates decrease Delta T and increase the time interval of heat releasing at the end of the day. The dependence of the UTC performance on the stability of the radiative regime is studied here for the first time in a systematic manner. The type of PCM with best performance depends on month and on the value of the sunshine number (SSN). The daily amount of heat released inside the building, Xi(day), increases by increasing the daily SSN value. The dependence of the transient coefficient of performance epsilon(COP) on the sunshine stability number (SSSN) is not obvious, neither for UTCs with PCM nor for UTCs without PCM, no matter the season is. epsilon(COP) is higher for UTCs without PCM than for UTCs with PCM. This is true for all seasons, as far as similar values of SSN or SSSN are considered. The spreading of epsilon(COP) values is larger for UTCs without PCM than for UTCs with PCM, in all seasons. The two performance indicators (Xi(day) and epsilon(cop)) induce different hierarchies among the types of PCM used in the UTC.

AB The primary issues for the popularization of electric vehicles are low energy density, short life, high cost, and long charging time of battery. In an extended-range electric vehicle, a range-extender is applied to realize the on-board electricity generation avoiding the range anxiety; and a large capacity battery and public charging facilities are not necessary. A primary issue is lack of an efficient range-extender that is light, compact and silent. The main reasons are that the efficiencies of range-extended engines now available are low; and the efficiency optimum operating points of the range-extended engines and generators are not matched.
   A 3-cylidner gasoline spark-ignition engine for an application in a range-extender has been investigated. Atkinson cycle, exhaust gas recirculation and gasoline direct injection are applied to suppress the knocking. At most cases, a range-extender engine has only a most frequent operating point. All design parameters and operating variables of the range-extender engine can be optimized around the single operating point to maximize the efficiency while matching to the highest efficiency point of a range-extender generator. For this purpose, an optimization and matching method by combing artificial neural network and genetic algorithm has been investigated. The optimization and matching for a range-extender engine, with no generator constraint and with three different constraints of generator efficiency maps, have been conducted. The results show that both the operating points and the optimal parameters of the range-extender engine are different under the different generator constraints. A higher maximum thermal efficiency of the range-extender engine can be achieved as the power requirement decreases. The maximum efficiency of the range-extender engine can reach 40.2%, which is because of the application of high geometrical compression ratio, exhaust gas recirculation, Atkinson cycle and single-point optimization of all parameters.

AB The shortage of fossil fuel, greenhouse gases emission, air pollution and global warming have attracted more and more researchers' attention on the adsorption technology, which utilizes low temperature thermal heat of solar thermal energy and waste heat. Moreover, the usage of natural materials as refrigerant such as water and methanol adds to its advantage. However, the low coefficient of performance and specific cooling power limits its further application. This paper proposes a novel combined adsorption system, which can provide the functions of air conditioning/refrigeration/heat pump heating and ammonia/organic expanding power generation. In addition, the consolidated advanced adsorbent is used in this system, the effect of which is investigated. The author also analyzed the most suitable organic for organic Rankine cycle in this system. The results reveal that the organic of N-Butane has the highest potential exergy and the most appropriate work pressure. The cooling exergy efficiency in the working modes of air conditioning, refrigeration and heat pump heating are about 0.18, 0.13 and 0.24, respectively. The simulation results indicate that, compared to the system with only cooling effect, the total exergy efficiency of the combined system can be improved from 0.15 to 0.31, because of the additional expanding power generation effect.

AB A numerical model for membrane-based liquid desiccant dehumidifiers is presented. The model uses the conjugate method and calculates a more realistic boundary condition on the membrane, and the separating walls. This boundary condition is calculated by the simultaneous solution of momentum, energy, and mass transfer equations of flows. To increase accuracy, flows are considered hydrodynamically, thermally, and in concentration to be developing. The validation results showed that the model can accurately predict the humidity ratio change of the supply air with less than 3.22% error. Afterward, four membrane-based liquid desiccant dehumidifiers including cross-flow, counter-flow, internally cooled and developed internally cooled are modeled and investigated. The dehumidifiers performances are compared at different inlet air conditions, and the results indicate that the developed internally cooled dehumidifier has the highest effectiveness.

AB Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) have serrated flows to accommodate plastic deformation at room temperature, where the mechanical energy is accumulated in a stress arising process and then released by a following stress drop. In this study, the variation of the mechanical energy accumulation rate of a Zr-based BMG under varying external disturbances, including the geometric confinement, sample sizes and stress gradients, has been investigated at varying strain rates. In all groups of specimens, the accumulation rates for the elastic strain energy during the plastic-flow serrations are different from the values at the initial elastic stages under compression tests, and have large variations. The variations of the accumulation rates are affected by the applied strain rates, and smaller variations are observed at relatively-lower strain rates (5 x 10(-4) s(-1) and 5 x 10(-5) s(-1)). Such variations in the change of the applied strain rates are independent of the presence of the geometric confinement, size effect and stress gradients, and may be attributed to the intrinsic deformation mechanisms of BMGs. The findings give further insights into the mechanisms on the evolution of flow serrations in BMGs.

Structural and compositional differences given by the chosen deposition technique and post deposition treatment were revealed by Raman spectroscopy and EDS. Applicability of studied thin films in electron beam lithography was investigated using both monoamine and diamine based developers. Thermally evaporated thin films exhibited negative etching contrary to the spin-coated films which showed positive etching. Studied thin films proved to be suitable positive and negative photoresists for both grey-scale and step-like lithography.

AB A new TeO2-Ga2O3-BaO (TGB) glass system has been explored to achieve high-efficient luminescence at 2 mu m region. The glasses are characterized by wide infrared transmittance range, excellent thermal stability, high density and refractive index, and low maximum phonon energy. Judd-Ofelt analysis reveals high spontaneous emission probabilities of Tm3+ and Ho3+ in this glass host. As a result, intense emissions near 1.8 and 2 mu m were realized in the Tm3+-doped and Nd3+/Ho3+ co-doped TGB glasses, respectively. The emission cross-sections of Tm3+ and Ho3+ are 1.024 x 10(-20) cm(2) and 0.829 x 10(-20) cm(2) with maximum gain coefficients of 4.51 and 1.55 cm(-1), respectively. The combined results indicate that the TGB glass system is a potential host for obtaining high-efficient 2 mu m luminescence.

DE Chalcogenide glass; ZnSe: Cr2+ crystal; Emission property; Mid-infrared

AB Mid-infrared (MIR) light sources are indispensable in modern photonic society. In this work, the composites of the As-S-Se chalcogenide glasses containing MIR-emitting ZnSe: Cr2+ submicron-particles are fabricated by two methods, melt-quenching and hot-pressing. The MIR refractive index, transmittance and photoluminescence properties are investigated and compared in the composites prepared by the two methods. Benefiting from the wide glass forming region of the As-S-Se system, it is possible, by tuning the glass composition, to find a glass (e.g., As40S57Se3) with the refractive index well matching that of the ZnSe: Cr2+ crystal. The composites prepared by the melt-quenching method have higher MIR transmittance, but the MIR emission can only be observed in the samples prepared by the hot-pressing technique. The corresponding reasons are discussed based on microstructural analyses. The results reported in this article could provide helpful theoretical and experimental information for making novel broadband MIR-emitting sources based on chalcogenide glasses.

AB Radiation-induced attenuation (RIA) at lambda = 1.55 mu m is studied in polarization-maintaining (PM) pure-silica-core optical fibers of the Panda-type under gamma-irradiation and upon pulsed-X-ray-irradiation. For the first time, the RIA spectrum is compared under gamma-irradiation in a Panda and in a non-PM fiber drawn from the same preform before embedding the stress-applying rods. It is found out that the chief RIA origins in the near-IR range in both fibers are an extremely short-lived band centered at similar to 1 eV and the tails of the classical bands due to strain-assisted self-trapped holes (STHs) at 1.63 and 1.88 eV. The former band is found to be many times more intense in the Panda; the latter bands, somewhat more intense in the non-PM fiber. The similar to 1-eV band proved to be composed of two Gaussian sub-bands centered at 0.95 and 1.12 eV. Under gamma-irradiation, the composite similar to 1-eV band is found to be photobleached virtually fully by 1.55-mu m light of 5-mW power, which results in manifold reduction of the total RIA. Upon pulsed irradiation, RIA in Pandas at large post-pulse times (> 1 ms-1 s) is found to fall off below the record low level demonstrated elsewhere by a non-PM pure-silica-core fiber. This fact is explained as being due to a smaller concentration of strain-assisted STHs in Pandas than in non-PM fibers. The concentration of strain assisted STHs in Pandas is shown to increase with increasing the value of birefringence.

AB The physical and chemical instability of amorphous pharmaceuticals during storage has become a major problem for the pharmaceutical industry, as most of the pharmaceuticals including some life saving drugs are also found to be poorly water soluble. Molecular mobility is a key factor to understand the various crucial parameters that determine the stability of amorphous phase. The molecular dynamics in the supercooled liquid and glassy states of three Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) Acemetacin, Brucine and Colchicine were characterized by molecular relaxation (mobility) using broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) in a wide frequency range. Primary structural relaxation and intra-molecular (non Johan-Goldstein) secondary relaxation were observed above and below T-g respectively in all three title compounds. The dielectric spectra were fitted to the Havriliak-Negami (HN) function. The temperature dependence of the structural relaxation time followed Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman (VET) equation and the secondary relaxation followed Arrhenius equation. By Coupling model (CM) prediction, the secondary relaxations in all title compounds were found to be non JG. The width of the structural relaxation peak decreases with temperature for brucine and colchicine while it increases for acemetacin. By Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) experiment, we confirmed that the selelcted compounds are good glass formers and their structural properties and hydrogen bonding were studied by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and verified by Density Functional theory (DFT). By BDS, the parameters which describe the molecular dynamics in the supercooled and glassy states of the title compounds, like glass transition temperature (T-g) the width of the alpha relaxation (beta(KWW)), the temperature dependence of alpha-relaxation times (tau(alpha)) the fragility (m) and the activation energy of the secondary relaxation (Ea-gamma), were determined. The higher values of T-g determined (307.9 K for acemetacin, 366.2 K for brucine and 374.5 K for colchicine) indicates stability of their amorphous phase at normal storage conditions. The fragility index values of the title compounds indicate intermediately fragile behaviour. The FTIR analysis of the crystalline and amorphous states of brucine, acemetacin and colchicine shows the presence of hydrogen bonding in amorphous phase of the title compounds and verified that their molecular structures were retained in the amorphous state.

AB xCeF(3)-doped (30-x)SrF2-20Al(2)O(3)-50B(2)O(3) glasses (x = 0.1, 1.0, 5.0 and 10 mol%) were synthesized by the conventional melt quenching method, and then characterizations for scintillator applications were performed. Regarding the photoluminescence (PL) properties, the glasses show a broad emission band around 360 nm under excitation of approximately 325 nm, and the decay time constant is several tens of nano-seconds. From the results, the origin is attributed to the 5d -> 4f transitions of Ce3+. As scintillation properties, the X-ray induced scintillation spectra and decay time constants are reasonably consistent with the PL. Among the present glass samples, the scintillation intensity is the highest when doped with 1% Ce. The light yields of the 1% Ce-doped glass shows 240 photons/MeV under Co-57 122 keV gamma-ray exposure. The light yields were derived as relative values to that of commercial GS20 glass scintillator. This is the first report on the scintillation light yields of Ce-doped SrF2-Al2O3-B2O3 glasses. Furthermore, the materials also exhibit thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) properties with a major glow peak around 80 degrees C, and the sensitivity to radiation dose is as low as 0.1 mGy for the 0.1% and 1.0% Ce-doped glasses with a good linearity confirmed to 100 mGy.

AB In this work, nanoporous Cr2O3 was easily synthesized through the direct thermolysis of the as-prepared chromium-based metal-organic framework (MIL-101(Cr)) in air and used as a dopant to titanium alkali borosilicate glasses. The integration of octahedral unit of nanoparticles Cr2O3 in the network of titanium alkali borosilicate glasses, as deduced from FTIR enhanced the physical properties of the glasses by transforming the [BO3] into [BO4] structural units and consequently creating surplus bridging oxygens. The increase of the fraction N-4 consolidates this hypothesis. The mentioned oxygens increased the number of bonds per unit volume, the density and decreased the molar volume of the glass network. The variations of these physical parameters as a function of Cr2O3 increased the ultrasonic velocities, the Debye temperature and the rigidity of the glasses on one hand and decrease the optical band gap on the other hand.

AB Microbial biofilms can be both cause and cure to a range of emerging societal problems including antimicrobial tolerance, water sanitation, water scarcity and pollution. The identities of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) responsible for the establishment and function of biofilms are poorly understood. The lack of information on the chemical and physical identities of EPS limits the potential to rationally engineer biofilm processes, and impedes progress within the water and wastewater sector towards a circular economy and resource recovery. Here, a multidisciplinary roadmap for addressing this EPS identity crisis is proposed. This involves improved EPS extraction and characterization methodologies, cross-referencing between model biofilms and full-scale biofilm systems, and functional description of isolated EPS with in situ techniques (e.g. microscopy) coupled with genomics, proteomics and glycomics. The current extraction and spectrophotometric characterization methods, often based on the principle not to compromise the integrity of the microbial cells, should be critically assessed, and more comprehensive methods for recovery and characterization of EPS need to be developed.

AB Metal-free photocatalysts have attracted growing concern in recent years. In this work, a new class of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) modified porous graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is synthesized via a facile polymerization method. With the optimal CQDs loading, the CQDs modified g-C3N4 exhibits similar to 15 times higher degradation kinetic towards diclofenac (DCF) than that of pure g-C3N4. The enhanced photo-catalytic activity can be ascribed to the improved separation of charge carriers as well as the tuned band structure. Moreover, a photosensitation-like mechanism is proposed to elucidate the photo-generated electrons transfer and reactive radicals formation. CQDs are anchored to g-C3N4 surface via C-O bond, which provide channels for the preferential transfer of photo-excited electrons on DCF molecule to the conduction band of g-C3N4. Superoxide radical (center dot O-2(-)) dominates the degradation of DCF, while holes (h(+)) show a negligible contribution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation successfully predicts that the sites on DCF molecule with high Fukui index (f(0)) are preferable to be attacked by radicals. DCF degradation pathway mainly includes ring hydroxylation, ring closure and C-N bond cleavage processes. Acute toxicity estimation indicates the formation of less toxic intermediates/products compared to DCF after photocatalysis. Moreover, the hybrid photocatalysts exhibit good reusability in five consecutive cycles. This work not only proposes a deep insight into photosensitation-like mechanism in the photocatalysis system by using g-C3N4-based materials, but also develops new photocatalysts for potential application on removal of emerging organic pollutants from waters and wastewaters.

AB Phosphate (PO43--P) and nitrate (NO3--N) in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants are the predominant sources of eutrophication. In this study, a bench-scale electrochemically assisted vertical flow constructed wetland (E-VFCW) was developed, which exhibited favorable PO43--P (89.7-99.4%), NO3--N (82.7-99.6%), and TN (51.9-93.7%) removal efficiency in tertiary wastewater treatment. In addition, little N2O accumulation (0.32-2.19% of Delta NO3--N) was observed. The study further elucidated that PO43--P was removed mainly in the anode chamber by co-precipitation (Fe(n+)OH-PO4) and adsorption (FeOOH-PO4) pathways. Multi-pathway of NO3--N reduction was proposed, with 13.9-30.2% of NO3--N predominantly eliminated in the anode chamber by ferrous-dependent NO3--N reduction bacteria. In the cathode chamber, electrons storage and resupply modes during S cycle exerted crucial roles in NO3--N reduction, which enhanced the resilience capabilities of the E-VFCW to shock loadings. Stoichiometric analysis revealed that 3.3-6.6 mmol e(-)/cycle were stored in the form of S-0, FeS, and FeS2 in the E-VFCW under longer HRT or higher current density. However, the deposited S resupplied 19.6% and 28.3% of electrons for NO3--N reduction under shorter HRT (1 h) or lower current density (0.01 mA cm(-2)). Moreover, ferrous-driven NO3--N-reducing or DNRA bacteria also promoted NO3--N elimination in the cathode chamber. These findings provide new insight into the coupling interactions among S, Fe and H cycles, as well as N and P transformations in electrochemically assisted NO3--N reduction systems.

AB Litter decomposition is a vital part of the global carbon cycle as it determines not only the amount of carbon to be sequestered, but also how fast carbon re-enters the cycle. Freshwater systems play an active role in the carbon cycle as it receives, and decomposes, terrestrial litter material alongside decomposing aquatic plant litter. Decomposition of organic matter in the aquatic environment is directly controlled by water temperature and nutrient availability, which are continuously affected by global change.
   We adapted the Tea Bag Index (TBI), a highly standardized methodology for determining soil decomposition, for lakes by incorporating a leaching factor. By placing Lipton pyramid tea bags in the aquatic environment for 3 h, we quantified the period of intense leaching which usually takes place prior to litter (tea) decomposition. Standard TBI methodology was followed after this step to determine how fast decomposition takes place (decomposition rate, k(1)) and how much of the material cannot be broken down and is thus sequestered (stabilization factor, S). A Citizen Science project was organized to test the aquatic TBI in 40 European lakes located in four climate zones, ranging from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic systems. We expected that warmer and/or eutrophic lakes would have a higher decomposition rate and a more efficient microbial community resulting in less tea material to be sequestered.
   The overall high decomposition rates (k(1)) found confirm the active role lakes play in the global carbon cycle. Across climate regions the lakes in the warmer temperate zone displayed a higher decomposition rate (k(1)) compared to the colder lakes in the continental and polar zones. Across trophic states, decomposition rates were higher in eutrophic lakes compared to oligotrophic lakes. Additionally, the eutrophic lakes showed a higher stabilization (S), thus a less efficient microbial community, compared to the oligotrophic lakes, although the variation within this group was high. Our results clearly show that the TBI can be used to adequately assess the decomposition process in aquatic systems. Using "alien standard litter" such as tea provides a powerful way to compare decomposition across climates, trophic states and ecosystems.
   By providing standardized protocols, a website, as well as face to face meetings, we also showed that collecting scientifically relevant data can go hand in hand with increasing scientific and environmental literacy in participants. Gathering process-based information about lake ecosystems gives managers the best tools to anticipate and react to future global change. Furthermore, combining this process-based information with citizen science, thus outreach, is in complete agreement with the Water Framework Directive goals as set in 2010. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In biological wastewater treatment, the bacteria starvation always challenges the stability of system operation. Yet, the effects of starvation and possibility of reactivation are less understood for anaerobic sulfidogenic system. Sulfidogenic systems use sulfate as electron acceptor for organic chemical oxygen demand (COD) degradation, so it will encounter two kind of starvations: (i) complete stoppage of wastewater flow (named complete food starvation) and (ii) remaining organic COD but with very low level sulfate in the influent (named sulfate starvation). In this study, the relative long-term starvation (over 30-day) and subsequent reactivation were studied in two lab-scale continuous gas recirculation sulfate-reducing upflow sludge bed (CGR-SRUSB) reactors. It was observed that the complete food starvation and sulfate starvation decreased the COD removal rate (in the similar range of 60-65%) and the specific sulfidogenic activity (about 45% and 61% respectively), as well as increasing the sludge flotation potential (SFP) from <15% to 58% and 35% respectively. Moreover, the following restoration experiments proved that the perturbed systems could be reactivated within 10-15 days for both cases. The results of investigating the mechanisms showed the performance deterioration were highly attributed to the starvation-induced granular sludge transitions, with respect to the changing of sludge physico-chemical properties (permeability, porosity, hydrophobicity and viscocity) and microbial stuctures (sulfate-reducting bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances). The outcomes of this study can provide useful information for dealing with the prolonged starvation problems in sulfidogenesis-based systems in industrial and municipal wastewater treatment.

AB A novel electro-assisted membrane bioreactor (EMBR) was constructed by integrating conductive carbon nanotubes hollow fiber membranes (CNTs-HFMs) into an aerobic activated sludge system. Herein, the CNTs-HFMs served as anode and filtration core simultaneously. Contrasted with the other two MBRs (PVDF-HFMs and CNTs-HFMs without electro-assistance), the effluent COD and NH4+-N were lower than 40 mg/L and 3 mg/L at +1.0 V even HRT as short as 4 h. However, they were mostly over 50 mg/L (COD) and 5 mg/L (NH4+-N) under the same conditions in the other two MBRs. The hydraulic cleaning for electro-assisted CNTs-HFMs was carried out only once during 60-day operation, and the permeate flux recovered to 100% of the original status. While four and five times hydraulic cleaning were executed for other two MBRs (PVDF-HFMs and CNTs-HFMs), respectively. Furthermore, merely 50 min continuous electrochemical oxidation was enough to resume flux of the heavily fouled CNTs-HFMs, i.e. flux recovered to 2020.87 L/(bar.m(2).h) from 394.68 L/(bar.m(2).h) (pure water flux, similar to 2200 L(bar.m(2).h)). Simpson and Shannon indexes indicated enhanced microbial community stability in EMBR. Thus, electro-assisted CNTs-HFMs endow EMBR excellent anti-fouling ability and good effluent quality.

AB In this work, nano-bimetallic Co/Fe oxides with different stoichiometric Co/Fe ratios were prepared using a novel one-step solution combustion method. The nano-bimetallic Co/Fe oxides were used for sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation via peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. The stoichiometric efficiencies of the as-prepared nano-bimetallic catalysts were calculated and compared for the first time, The radical generation was identified by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) as well as chemical quenching experiments, in which different scavengers were used and compared. The catalytic PMS activation mechanism in the presence of catalyst was examined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that besides SO4 center dot(-) and center dot OH, center dot OOH was also detected in the PMS/CoFeO2.5 system. Meanwhile, in addition to the previously proposed radical oxidation pathway, the results showed that SMX degradation also involved a non-radical oxidation, which could be verified by the degradation experiment without catalyst as well as the detection of O-1(2). In the PMS activation process, cobalt functioned as the active site on CoFeO2.5 while Fe oxide functioned as the adsorption site. The electron transfer mechanism was proposed based on the XPS and metal leaching results. Additionally, via the detection of transformation products, different SMX transformation pathways involving nitration, hydroxylation and hydrolysis in the PMS/CoFeO2.5 system were proposed.

AB Little is known about how introducing recycled water intended for direct potable reuse (DPR) into distribution systems and premise plumbing will affect water quality at the point of use, particularly with respect to effects on microbial communities and regrowth. The examination of potential growth of opportunistic pathogens (OPs) and spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), each representing serious and growing public health concerns, by introducing DPR water has not previously been evaluated. In this study, the impact of blending purified DPR water with traditional drinking water sources was investigated with respect to treatment techniques, blending location, and blending ratio. Water from four U.S. utility partners was treated in bench- and pilot-scale treatment trains to simulate DPR with blending. Water was incubated in simulated premise plumbing rigs made of PVC pipe containing brass coupons to measure regrowth of total bacteria (16S rRNA genes, heterotrophic plate count), OPs (Legionella spp., Mycobacterium spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa), ARGs (qnrA, vanA), and an indicator of horizontal gene transfer and multi-drug resistance (intl1). The microbial community composition was profiled and the resistome (i.e., all ARGs present) was characterized in select samples using next generation sequencing. While regrowth of total bacteria (16S rRNA genes) from the start of the incubation through week eight consistently occurred across tested scenarios (Wilcoxon, p <= 0.0001), total bacteria were not more abundant in the water or biofilm of any DPR scenario than in the corresponding conventional potable condition (p >= 0.0748). Regrowth of OP marker genes, qnrA, vanA, and intl1 were not significantly greater in water or biofilm for any DPR blends treated with advanced oxidation compared to corresponding potable water (p >= 0.1047). This study of initial bacteria colonizing pipes after introduction of blended DPR water revealed little evidence (i.e., one target in one water type) of exacerbated regrowth of total bacteria, OPs, or ARGs in premise plumbing.

AB To provide information for the design and improvement of full-scale biofilters, pilot-scale biofiltration studies are the current industry standard because they utilize the same filter media size and loading rate as the full-scale biofilters. In the current study, bench-scale biofilters were designed according to a biofilter scaling model from the literature, and the ability of the bench-scale biofilters to accurately represent the organics removal of pilot-scale biofilters was tested. To ensure similarity in effluent water quality between bench- and pilot- or full-scale biofilters at the same influent substrate concentration, the tested model requires that either mass transport resistance or biofilm shear loss takes primacy over the other. The potential primacy of mass transport resistance or biofilm shear loss was evaluated via water quality testing (dissolved organic carbon, specific ultraviolet absorbance, liquid chromatography - organic carbon detection, trihalomethane formation potential, and haloacetic acid formation potential). The biofilters also were characterized for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, enzyme activity, extracellular polymeric substances, and microbial community structure. The results of this study indicate that biofilm shear loss takes primacy over mass transport resistance for bench-scale biofilter design in this system; thus, bench-scale biofilters designed in this manner accurately represent organics removal in pilot-scale biofilters. Applying this scaling procedure can reduce filter media requirements from many kilograms to just a few grams and daily water requirements from thousands of liters to less than 10 L This scaling procedure will allow future researchers to test alternative treatment designs and operating conditions without the need for expensive pilot-scale studies.

AB Microbes interact with metals and minerals in the environment altering their physical and chemical states, whilst in turn metals and minerals impact on microbial growth, activity and survival. The interactions between bacteria and dissolved chromium in the presence of iron minerals, and their impact on Cr isotope variations, were investigated. Cr(VI) reduction experiments were conducted with two bacteria, Pseudomonas fluorescens LB 300 and Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, in the presence of two iron oxide minerals, goethite and hematite. Both minerals were found to inhibit the rates of Cr(VI) reduction by Pseudomonas, but accelerated those of Shewanella. The Cr isotopic fractionation factors generated by Shewanella were independent of the presence of the minerals (epsilon = -2.3 parts per thousand). For Pseudomonas, the epsilon value was the same in both the presence and absence of goethite (-3.3 parts per thousand); although, it was much higher (epsilon = -4.3 parts per thousand) in the presence of hematite. The presence of aqueous Fe(III) in solution had no detectable impact on either bacterial Cr reduction rates nor isotopic fractionation factors. The presence of aqueous Fe(II) induced rapid abiotic reduction of Cr(VI). The different effects that the presence of Fe minerals had on the Cr fractionation factors and reduction rates of the different bacterial species may be attributed to the way each bacteria attached to the minerals and their different reduction pathways. SEM images confirmed that Pseudomonas cells were much more tightly packed on the mineral surfaces than were Shewanella. The images also confirmed that Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 produced nanowires. The results suggest that the dominant Cr(Vl) reduction pathway for Pseudomonas fluorescens LB 300 may have been through membrane-bound enzymes, whilst for Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 it was probably via extra-cellular electron transfer. Since different minerals impact differentially on bacterial Cr(VI) reduction and isotope fractionation, variations of mineralogies and the associated changes of bacterial communities should be taken into consideration when using Cr isotopes to quantify Cr redox behaviour in the environment.

AB Ensuring safe and effective water treatment, distribution, and reuse requires robust methods for characterizing and monitoring waterborne microbes. Methods widely used today can be limited by low sensitivity, high labor and time requirements, susceptibility to interference from inhibitory compounds, and difficulties in distinguishing between viable and non-viable cells. Flow cytometry (FCM) has recently gained attention as an alternative approach that can overcome many of these challenges. This article critically and systematically reviews for the first time recent literature on applications of FCM in water treatment, distribution, and reuse. In the review, we identify and examine nearly 300 studies published from 2000 to 2018 that illustrate the benefits and challenges of using FCM for assessing source-water quality and impacts of treatment-plant discharge on receiving waters, wastewater treatment, drinking water treatment, and drinking water distribution. We then discuss options for combining FCM with other indicators of water quality and address several topics that cut across nearly all applications reviewed. Finally, we identify priority areas in which more work is needed to realize the full potential of this approach. These include optimizing protocols for FCM-based analysis of waterborne viruses, optimizing protocols for specifically detecting target pathogens, automating sample handling and preparation to enable real-time FCM, developing computational tools to assist data analysis, and improving standards for instrumentation, methods, and reporting requirements. We conclude that while more work is needed to realize the full potential of FCM in water treatment, distribution, and reuse, substantial progress has been made over the past two decades. There is now a sufficiently large body of research documenting successful applications of FCM that the approach could reasonably and realistically see widespread adoption as a routine method for water quality assessment.

AB This study revealed that, Thiothrix eikelboomii, a well-known filamentous bacterium that causes sludge bulking, could also interfere oxygen transfer during wastewater treatment. The volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (K(L)a) in filamentous-bulking sludge (FBS) was found to be 43% lower than that in floc-forming sludge (FFS) at similar biomass concentrations, partially because the filamentous bacteria had increased the sludge apparent viscosity. The K(L)a value for FBS, however, was still significantly lower than that for FFS even if both sludges had similar apparent viscosity. Numerous tiny and free-swimming filaments were observed to attach on the air bubble surface, presumably reducing the liquid film renewal and increasing the liquid film thickness. Moreover, the filaments were co-coated with extracellular polymeric substances of protein and polysaccharide, which could make them performing like "amphiphilic molecules" of surfactants to hinder oxygen transfer. Therefore, the particular surface property of filaments and their interaction with air bubbles could also impact oxygen transfer. Thiothrix eikelboomii was identified to be the responsible filamentous bacterium that lowered the K(L)a value, while other filamentous bacteria with short filaments did not interfere oxygen transfer. This study implies that controlling sludge bulking benefits not only sludge settling but also oxygen transfer. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an enteric virus divided into eight genotypes. Genotype 1 (G1) and G2 are specific to humans; G3, G4 and G7 are zoonotic genotypes infecting humans and animals. Transmission to humans through water has been demonstrated for G1 and G2, mainly in developing countries, but is only suspected for the zoonotic genotypes. Thus, the water-related HEV hazard may be due to human and animal faeces. The high HEV genetic variability allows considering the presence in wastewater of not only different genotypes, but also quasispecies adding even greater diversity. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that HEV particles may be either quasi-enveloped or non-enveloped, potentially implying differential viral behaviours in the environment.
   The presence of HEV has been demonstrated at the different stages of the water cycle all over the world, especially for HEV G3 in Europe and the USA. Concerning HEV survival in water, the virus does not have higher resistance to inactivating factors (heat, UV, chlorine, physical removal), compared to viral indicators (MS2 phage) or other highly resistant enteric viruses (Hepatitis A virus). But the studies did not take into account genetic (genogroups, quasispecies) or structural (quasi- or non-enveloped forms) HEV variability. Viral variability could indeed modify HEV persistence in water by influencing its interaction with the environment, its infectivity and its pathogenicity, and subsequently its transmission by water. The cell culture methods used to study HEV survival still have drawbacks (challenging virus cultivation, time consuming, lack of sensitivity). As explained in the present review, the issue of HEV transmission to humans through water is similar to that of other enteric viruses because of their similar or lower survival. HEV transmission to animals through water and how the virus variability affects its survival and transmission remain to be investigated. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Medium-pressure ultraviolet light (MP-UV) combined with calcium peroxide (CaO2) as a pretreatment technology for removing carbamazepine (CBZ) and primidone (PMD) in waste active sludge (WAS) and improving the solubilization of sludge were investigated. CBZ and PMD were effectively removed and the removal fitted pseudo-first kinetics under MP-UV/CaO2 treatment with R-2 > 0.97. The higher CaO2 dosage and lower initial volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentration were conductive to the removal of CBZ and PMD. Of the CaO2 hydrolysates, Ca(OH)(2) played a more important role than H2O2 during MP-UV/CaO2 treatment. The removal of the target compounds was attributed to direct photolysis and indirect photolysis caused by center dot OH, (DOM)-D-3*, and O-1(2), in which center dot OH played a vital role with > 62.2% contribution to the overall degradation rate. A model predicting the steady concentration of center dot OH in WAS ([VSS] approximate to 8.6 g L-1) under MP-UV/CaO2 treatment with CaO2 dosage ranging from 0 to 0.5 g g(-1)-VSS was proposed and validated. Moreover, major intermediates of CBZ and PMD were detected and the probable transformation pathways during MP-UV/CaO2 treatment were proposed. In addition, MP-UV/CaO2 promoted the sludge solubilization effectively. Considering both the pharmaceutical degradation and sludge solubilization, the optimum operation condition with 0.2 g-CaO2 g(-1)-VSS combined with 7 h MP-UV irradiation is recommended. Under this condition, more than 923% of CBZ and 90.3% of PMD were removed, and soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) increased by 657% and 13.6% compared with sole 10 h CaO2 (0.2 g g(-1)-VSS) treatment and 7 h MP-UV treatment, respectively.

AB Imitating natural lakes, pond treatment systems inherit a high complexity with interconnected web of biochemical reactions and complex hydraulic processes. As such, its simulation requires a large and integrated model, which has been a challenge for pond engineers. In this study, we develop an all encompassing model to gain a quantitative and comprehensive understanding of the hydraulic, physicochemical and microbiological conversion processes in the most common pond, a facultative pond. Moreover, to deal with an evitable issue of large mechanistic models as overparameterization leading to poor identifiability, a systematic parameter estimation was implemented. The application of sensitivity analysis reveals the most influential parameters on pond performance. Particularly, physical parameters, such as vertical eddy diffusivity, water temperature, and maximum growth rate of heterotrophs induce the most changes of organic matters while microbial assimilation and ammonia volatilization appear to be main processes for nutrient removal. In contrast, the efficiency of phosphate precipitation and nutrient biological removal via polyphosphate accumulating organisms and denitrifying bacteria is limited. Identifiability problems are addressed mainly by the characterization of light dependence of algal growth, interaction between water temperature and its coefficient, and the growth of autotrophic bacteria while based on the determinant measures, the most important parameter subsets affecting model outputs are related to physical processes and algal activity. After the establishment of the influential and identifiable parameter subset, an automatic calibration with the data collected from Ucubamba pond system (Ecuador) demonstrates the effect of high-altitude climatic conditions on pond behaviors. An aerobic prevailing condition is observed as a result of high light intensity causing accelerated algal activities, hence, leading to the limitation of hydrolysis, anaerobic processes, and the growth of anoxic heterotrophs for denitrification. Furthermore, the output of uncertainty analysis indicates that a large avoidable uncertainty as a result of vast complexity of the applied model can be reduced greatly via a systematic approach for parameter estimation.

AB A mechanistic model for assessing the fate and removal efficiency of hydrophobic organic contaminants in horizontal subsurface flow treatment wetlands was developed and evaluated using empirical concentration data from Singapore's Lorong Halus Treatment Wetland. This treatment wetland consists of a series of horizontal subsurface flow reed beds. The model, calibrated for the Lorong Halus Treatment Wetland, provided an adequate description of the concentrations of nine neutral organic substances in water, rhizomes and emergent vegetation in the wetland. The model was applied to investigate the sensitivity of the contaminant removal efficiency to environmental conditions and physicochemical properties of contaminants that enter the wetland. The water-budget of the wetland was found to exhibit an important influence on both the mass-removal efficiency and reduction of contaminant concentrations that can be achieved through wetland treatment. The model illustrated that removal pathways of organic contaminants in the wetland varied as a function of the properties of the contaminants. The mass-removal efficiency of the treatment wetland was greatest for chemicals with a log K-OW between 3.0 and 5.0 and log K-AW > -1.0. Removal of contaminants through volatilization was found to be greatest for substances with a log K-OW between 3 and 5 and log K-AW > 0. Transpiration flux in vegetation was found to be most important for substances with a log K-OW between 4.5 and 5.5 and a log K-AW between -5.0 and 0.0. Biotransformation rates of the contaminants in the wetland media play a crucial role in the removal of contaminants from wastewater. The model provides a tool for assessing the removal capacity of treatment wetlands for neutral organic contaminants and evaluating trade-offs in the design and operation of a horizontal subsurface flow treatment wetland.

AB Ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV LEDs) are a promising technology for the disinfection of water and wetted surfaces, but research into these applications remains limited. In the drinking water field, UV LEDs emitting at wavelengths ranging from 254 nm to 285 nm (UVC LEDs) have been shown to be effective for the inactivation of numerous pathogens and pathogen surrogate organisms at UV doses comparable to conventional germicidal UV lamps. Surface disinfection with UV light, from UVC LEDs or from conventional UV lamps, is not as well understood. As the technology underlying the design and construction of UV LEDs matures and their energy efficiency improves, it is likely that they will become ubiquitous in small scale water treatment applications and surface disinfection in various industries, including the medical and dental fields. A simple, easily replicated methodology was developed and optimized to grow, irradiate, and recover biofilms from coupons. It was hypothesized that higher UV doses would be required to inactivate biofilm-bound bacteria than planktonic (free-floating) bacteria because the biofilm would provide some degree of protection from the effects of UVC irradiation. Indeed, UV LED irradiation at 265 nm achieved 1.3 +/- 0.2 log inactivation of biofilm-bound Pseudomonas aeruginose at a UV dose of 8 mJ/cm(2). This inactivation level is lower than those that have been reported by researchers using UVC LEDs to inactivate planktonic P. aeruginosa, a finding that can be explained by the higher resistance of biofilm-bound bacteria to UV inactivation. A dose-response curve was developed and fitted to three disinfection models: the Chick-Watson model, the multi-target model, and the Geeraerd model. This last, which posits a subpopulation of organisms that are resistant to treatment, was a good fit to the dose-response data. ATP results obtained using the biomass recovery ATP method (ATP(BR)), a method that includes a 4 h incubation period after treatment, was well correlated to the results of conventional plate counts.

AB Heterogeneous Fenton process is a kind of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) that is significant for wastewater treatment. In the first part of this study, acid yellow 36 (AY36) degradation process has occurred in two kinds of reactors: fluidized-bed and stirred-tank reactors. Performances of these two semi-pilot reactors are compared by evaluating the removal ratio of the dye and pH changes during the process. Pyrite has been used as a heterogeneous catalyst. For obtaining the characteristics of pyrite, XRD, SEM, and FT-IR analysis have been carried out. In the second part of this study, a modified computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method has been utilized to solve the momentum and mass balances for heterogeneous Fenton process in both reactors. In AOPs, free radicals are reactive and have a short lifetime, so that turbulence mixing would be a limiting factor for the reactions that radicals are involved. By introducing a new parameter, named turbulence mixing rate, as a reaction rate for reactive species like hydroxyl radicals, the results of removal ratio and pH changes during the process showed a good agreement between the experiments and the CFD simulations, compared with not including the mixing rate in the CFD simulations (conventional kinetic modeling). In addition, the results revealed the high performance of the fluidized-bed reactor for this process in both experiments and CFD simulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study characterized the release kinetics of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE) from millimeter-sized microplastic pellets in water at environmentally relevant temperatures. Leaching rates of BFRs from the microplastic pellets made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) were found to be controlled by their diffusion within the plastic matrix, and their diffusion coefficients (D) in the plastic matrices ranged from 10(-28.30) to 10(-20.84) m(2) s(-1). The apparent activation energies of the BFRs' diffusion coefficients were estimated to be in the range of 64.1-131.8 kJ mol(-1) based on their temperature dependence and the Arrhenius equation. The diffusion coefficients of the BFRs decrease with their molecular diameters, while the activation energies for diffusion increase with the molecular diameters, which are indicative of significant steric hindrance for BFR diffusion within the plastic matrices. A semi-empirical linear relationship was observed between Log(10)D and the glass transition temperature (T-g) of plastics, which allows prediction of the diffusion coefficients of BFRs in other types of microplastics commonly found in marine environment. The half-lives of BFR leaching (i.e., 50% depletion) from the microplastic pellets would range from tens of thousands to hundreds of billions of years at ambient temperatures if their physical and chemical structures could remain intact. Although the release fluxes of BFRs from microplastics are extremely low under the model conditions, a range of physical and chemical processes in the natural environment and the digestive systems of organisms that ingested them could potentially accelerate their leaching by causing breakdown and swelling of the plastic matrices.

AB This study investigates the efficacy of the system O-3/sunlight radiation compared to dark ozonation when treating pharmaceuticals compounds of different reactivity, namely bezafibrate, cotinine, and iopamidol. Results show the beneficial effects of simulated sunlight radiation (300-800 nm) when treating ozone recalcitrant compounds such as cotinine and iopamidol. The system O-3/sunlight radiation increased mineralization extent in all cases if compared to dark ozonation. Transformation products identified in individual runs suggest that amine oxidation and further alkyl chain attack is the main route of bezafibrate ozonation. Hydroxylation seems to be the preferential path in cotinine abatement while H abstraction from alcoholic moieties is suggested in the case of iopamidol. Toxicity of intermediates was approximately evaluated by QSAR methodologies and experimentally through Daphnia Magna survival after 24 h. As a rule of thumb, initial intermediates generated are even more toxic than parent compounds, however, after 120 min of treatment, toxicity significantly decreased. Amongst the most toxic compounds generated: 4-Chlorobenzoyltyramine, and 4-Chloro-N-[2-(3,4-dihydroxy-phenyl)-ethyl]-benzamide (from bezafibrate), and N-(2-Hydroxy-1-hydroxymethyl-ethyl)-N'-(1-hydroxymethyl-2-oxoethyl)-5-(2-hydroxy-propionylamino)-2,4,6-triiodo-isophthalamide, N,N'-Bis-(1-hydroxymethyl-2-oxoethyl)-5-(2-hydroxy-propionylamino)-2,4,6-triiodo-isophthalamide, and N-(1-Hydroxymethyl-2-oxoethyl)-5-(2-hydroxy-propionylamino)-2,4,6-triiodo-isophthalamide (from iopamidol) were identified.

AB This study utilized physical adsorption and filtration of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and laccases to fabricate biomimetic dynamic membrane (BDM) for the advanced treatment of dye wastewater. In BDM, the adsorption, enzymatic degradation and membrane separation demonstrated a synergism effect on pollutant removal. At first, the fabrication methods of BDM were investigated, and the mixed filtration for laccases and CNTs showed a better performance than the stepwise filtration. Furthermore, the operation parameters of BDM, including CNTs and laccase loading amounts, dye concentration, agitation speed and transmembrane pressure (TMP), were studied. Suitable CNTs and laccase amounts could reduce filtration resistance and increase catalysis efficiency, while moderate TMP and agitation speed were in favor of boosting the BDM structure for catalysis and permeability. Optimized operation parameters (CNT loading amount = 20 g m(-2), laccase loading amount = 74.6 g m(-2), agitation speed = 100 rpm, and TMP = 1.0 bar) sustained a high removal rate, and the flux was over 120 L m(-2) h(-1), even for 7 operation cycle' tests. BDM exhibited an excellent dye removal rate, stable flux and great antifouling capacity, on the ground that adsorption saturation and foulant may be alleviated "online and in-situ" by the enzymatic degradation. Afterwards, the bionic layer on BDM, after absorption saturation and catalyst deactivation, could be eliminated rapidly by carrying out a simple backwash cleaning operation, then a new one could be fabricated immediately. Therefore, BDM is a good candidate for functional membrane materials in future water treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Flow-electrode capacitive deionization with highly enhanced salt removal

AB Flow-electrode-based capacitive deionization (FCDI) has attracted much attention owing to its continuous and scalable desalination process without the need for a discharging step, which is required in conventional fixed-electrode capacitive deionization. However, flow electrode slurry is poorly conductive, which restricts desalination performance, but higher carbon mass loading in the slurry could improve salt removal capacity due to enhanced connectivity. However, increased viscosity restricts higher loading of active materials. Herein, we report a significant increase in salt removal performance by introducing functionalized carbon nanotubes (FCNTs) into activated carbon (AC)-based flow electrodes, which led to the generation of conducting bridges between AC particles. The salt removal rate in the presence of 0.25 wt% FCNT with 5 wt% AC improved four-fold from that obtained with only 5 wt% AC, which is the highest value reported in the literature so far (from 1.45 to 5.72 mmol/m(2)s, at a saline water concentration of 35.0 g/L and applied potential of 1.2 V). Further, FCNTs with a high aspect ratio (similar to 50,000) can more effectively enhance salt removal than low-aspect ratio FCNTs (similar to 1300). Electrochemical analysis further confirms that the addition of FCNTs can efficiently form a connecting percolation network, thus enhancing the conductivity of the flow electrode slurry for the practical application of highly efficient desalination systems.

AB The effects of extreme cold water temperature, elevated cleaning water temperature, cleaning time on membrane performance, and pore size distribution were studied using flat-sheet polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. Extreme cold water temperature led to a decrease in membrane permeability, and membrane pore size shrinkage. The use of periodical warm water (35 degrees C) membrane conditioning could almost completely recover the membrane permeability and pore size structure loss caused by extreme cold water temperature, while the use of room temperature (23 +/- 1 degrees C) conditioning recovered majority of the membrane permeability and structure loss caused by extreme cold water temperature. Changes in membrane performance correlate well with changes in membrane structure. Membranes periodically conditioned in warmer water temperature showed a higher permeability than that periodically conditioned at room temperature from a long-term operation of three months. The results suggest the change in PVDF membrane performance and structure caused by extreme cold water temperature is almost completely reversible after periodical warm water conditioning, and thus the use of warm water conditioning and/or chemical cleaning will benefit the recovery of membrane performance and structure change caused by extreme cold water temperature in cold regions.

AB In typical anaerobic digestion (AD) systems, the microbial functional assertion is hampered by synchronised versatile metabolism required for heterogeneous substrates degradation. Thus, the intricate methanogenic process from organic compounds remains an enigma after decades of empirical operation. In this study, simplified AD microbial communities were obtained with substrate specifications and continuous reactor operation. Genome-centric metagenomic approach was followed to holistically investigate the metabolic pathways of the AD and the microbial synergistic networks. In total, 63 metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) were assembled from 8 metagenomes acquired in specific methanogenic niches. The metabolic pathways were reconstructed from the annotated genes and their dynamicity under experimental conditions. The results show that the methanogenic niches nourish unique metabolism beyond current knowledge acquired from cultivation-based methods. A novel glucose mineralization model without acetate formation was proposed and asserted in a pair of syntrophs: Clostridiaceae sp. and Methanoculleus thermophilus. Moreover, the catabolic pathway was elucidated in uncharacterized syntrophic acetate oxidizers, Synergistaceae spp. A remarkable evolutionary insight is the discovery that electron transport and energy conservation mechanisms impose selective pressure on syntrophic partners. Overall, the functional roles of the individual microbes tightly rely on the catabolic pathways and cannot always be physiologically defined in accordance with conventional four-step AD concept. The substrate-specific systems provided a traceable microbial community to dissecting the AD process. The genome-centric metagenomics successfully constructed genomes of microbes that have not been previously isolated and illustrated metabolic pathways that beyond the current knowledge of AD process. This study provides new perspectives to unravel the AD microbial ecology and suggests more attention should be paid on uncharacterized metabolism specifically harboured by AD microbial communities.

AB Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in degradation of organic pollutants by photochemically-produced reactive intermediates (RIs), such as excited triplet-states of DOM ((DOM)-D-3*), singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) and hydroxyl radical (center dot OH). However, it is not clear whether DOM extracted from coastal seawaters (CS-DOM) and DOM derived from freshwaters (FW-DOM) exhibit similar effects on photodegradation of organic micropollutants. Herein, 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (BP-1) was adopted as a model compound to probe the effects of different DOM on photodegradation kinetics of organic micropollutants. Results show that the CS-DOM promotes the photodegradation of BP-1 mainly via the pathway involving (DOM)-D-3*; while (DOM)-D-3*, O-1(2) and center dot OH are responsible for BP-1 photodegradation in the presence of the FW-DOM. Compared with the FW-DOM, the CS-DOM undergoes more photobleaching, and contains less aromatic C=C and C=O functional groups. Although (DOM)-D-3* formation quantum yields for the CS-DOM are relatively higher than those for the FW-DOM, the CS-DOM has lower rates of light absorption, leading to lower steady-state RI concentrations for the CS-DOM. BP-1 photodegradation in the presence of the CS-DOM is faster than in the presence of the FW-DOM, due to higher second-order reaction rate constants between BP-1 and CS-(DOM)-D-3* and fewer antioxidants contained in the CS-DOM.

AB Environmental fate or transport of pharmaceutical waste depends on the adsorptive interactions of pharmaceuticals with various environmental phases e.g. soil, sediment, microalgae, and bacteria etc. Therefore, it is important to understand these adsorptive interactions. As part of the study, we studied the adsorptive interaction of 30 chemicals with microalgae, i.e. Chlorella vulgaris, because it is ubiquitous and its surface area occupies a high proportion in aquatic environments. For this study, isotherms between C vulgaris and 30 micropollutants in neutral and ionic forms (i.e. 15 cations, 5 anions, and 10 neutrals) were experimentally measured, and their adsorptive affinities were then theoretically predicted based on the concept of the linear free energy relationship. For modeling, the dataset was divided into a training set and a test set, where the training set was used for model development and the test set was performed for model validation. This process was repeated ten times. Finally, we suggested one model which has high predictability in R-2 of 0.96 and standard error (SE) of 0.17 log unit for the training set, R-2 of 0.818 and SE = 0.217 log unit for the test set, and R-2 of 0.926 and SE of 0.169 log unit for the total dataset. Moreover, it was found that dispersive force, H-bond basicity, molecular volume, and electrostatic interaction of anion significantly contribute to the model developed based on the entire dataset. Here, dispersive and hydrophobic interactions (proportional to the magnitude of molecular size) are main attractive forces, while the rest cases are repulsive. In addition, it was found that the adsorption property of the surface of C. vulgaris differs from those of Gram negative bacteria Escherichia coli and dissolved organic matters in an aquatic environment.

AB This study evaluated attachment of a 30-nm nanoparticle to and detachment from fractal surfaces by calculating Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) interaction energies in three-dimensional space using the surface element integration technique. The fractal surfaces were generated using the Weierstass-Mandelbrot function with varying values of fractal dimension D (2.3 <= D <= 2.7) and fractal roughness G (0.000136 <= G <= 0.136). Results show that maximum energy barrier is reduced at peak areas of a fractal surface, and hence attachment in primary minima is favored. Some nanoparticles attached in primary minima at the peak areas can be detached by decreasing ionic strength (IS) due to monotonic decrease of interaction energy with increasing separation distance at low ISs. While the attachment in primary minima at valley areas is irreversible to IS reduction, the attachment is inhibited due to enhanced maximum energy barrier at these areas. A nonmonotonic variation of attachment efficiency in primary minimum (AEPM) with IS is present at high fractal dimension (D >= 2.4) or low fractal roughness (G < 0.00136), whereas the AEPM decreases monotonically with decreasing IS at low fractal dimension (D < 2.4) or high fractal roughness (G >= 0.00136). The AEPM decreases monotonically with increasing D or decreasing G at ISs from 1 mM to 200 mM. The decrease of AEPM with D or G is much slower at 10 mM compared to other ISs. These theoretical findings can explain various experimental observations in the literature, and can have important utility to development of water filtration techniques in engineered systems and to assessment of environmental risks of nanoparticles.

AB Applications of Fenton's oxidation of landfill leachate is limited by both high reagent requirements and a large amount of sludge generation. To address those issues, forward osmosis (FO) and humic acid (HA) recovery were incorporated with Fenton's treatment. In the FO, leachate was concentrated by 3.2 times in 10 hours using a 5-M NaCl draw solution. The HA recovery increased from 1.86 to 2.45 g L-1 at pH 2 after FO concentration, mainly because of the replacement of 0 in the HA structure by other inorganics (i.e., Cl, Na, K) with higher molecular weights. Due to the movement of alkalinity causing species (i.e., HCO3-, CO32-) to the draw side driven by a concentration gradient, the H2SO4 requirement per g of recovered HA and per g of removed COD decreased by 46.4% and 17.1%, respectively. The HA recovery also decreased sludge generation by 30%. At a dimensionless oxidant dose of 0.5, the proposed system reduced the overall requirement of H2SO4 by 25.2%, NaOH by 34.6%, and both FeSO(4 center dot)7H(2)O and H2O2 by 35%, compared to the standalone Fenton's treatment of raw leachate. Those results have demonstrated that the proposed system could greatly decrease the leachate volume, lower the reagent requirements, and reduce the sludge production towards sustainable leachate treatment.

AB Trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) often pass through conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plants (CAS-WWTPs) and are discharged into surface waters, where they can threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health, largely due to the hormone disrupting effects of certain TrOCs. The integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) process is a cost-effective means of upgrading CAS-WWTPs by adding free-floating carrier media, which promotes biofilm formation in the well-mixed suspended growth reactors, providing a potential niche for slow-growing microorganisms. Although IFAS upgrades are typically aimed at enhancing nutrient removal, limited bench- and pilot-scale data indicate that TrOC removal may also be improved. However, only limited reports which focus on a small number of compounds in individual full-scale IFAS-WWTPs have been published to date, and no data is available regarding the removal of estrogenic activity in full-scale IFAS-VVWTPs. In this study, six full-scale IFAS-WWTPs were surveyed to quantify TrOC and estrogenic activity removal. Twenty-four hour composite samples of secondary influent and effluent (pre-disinfection) were analyzed for total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), estrogenic activity, and 98 TrOCs. The biomass distribution between the suspended growth phase (i.e. mixed liquor) and IFAS media was also assessed. All IFAS-WWTPs performed well in terms of TSS, COD, and ammonia removal. TN removal varied in accordance with nitrate removal. Total solids per liter of wetted reactor volume ranged from 2.5 to 7.6 g, with 40-60% attached to media. TrOCs with no detection (17) and those with high median removal (23, >= 90% average removal) were observed. Other TrOCs had lower and more variable removal efficiencies. Qualitative comparison with CAS literature shows potentially higher IFAS removal efficiencies for a number of compounds including several which have been previously indicated in bench- or pilot-scale studies (atenolol, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, DEET, 4-nonylphenol, and 4-tertoctylphenol), as well as the chlorinated flame retardants TCIPP and TDCIPP. Effluent estrogenic activity was found to be similar to that reported for full-scale CAS-WWTPs. These results provide the first survey of multiple full-scale IFAS-WWTPs employing mobile plastic carrier media in terms of basic chemical endpoints (removal of ammonia, TN, TP, and COD), the distribution of solids within the systems, and the removal of TrOCs and estrogenic activity.

AB The two-phase continuous centrifugation process for olive oil extraction generates high amounts of olive oil mill wastewater (OMW), characterized by containing large concentrations of numerous contaminant compounds for the environment. An integral process based on physico-chemical (flocculation, photolysis and microfiltration) and microalgal growth stages was proposed for its treatment. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal percentages were 57.5%, 88.8% and 20.5% for flocculation, photolysis and microfiltration, respectively. The global removal percentages of organic load in the primary treatment were 96.2% for COD, 80.3% for total organic carbon (TOC) and 96.6% for total phenolic compounds (TPCs). In secondary treatment, different experiments using the microalgae Chlorella pyrenoidosa were performed on a laboratory scale in stirred batch tank reactors. The OMW concentrations in each culture medium were: 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% (v/v). The common experimental conditions were: pH = 7, temperature = 25 degrees C, agitation speed = 200 rpm, aeration rate = 0.5 (v/v) and illumination intensity = 359 mu E m(-2) s(-1). The highest maximum specific growth rate (0.07 h(-1)) and volumetric biomass production (1.25 mg/(L h)) values were achieved in the culture with 50% of OMW (v/v). The final biomass obtained had a high percentage of carbohydrates, whose content ranged from 30.3% to 89.2% and the highest lipid content (34.2%) was determined in the culture with 25% of OMW (v/v). The final treated water is suitable for its use in irrigation, discharge to receiving waters or for being reused in the same process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Chloroethenes belong to the most widely distributed groundwater contaminants. Since 2014, it has been known that trichloroethene (TCE) can be degraded aerobically and metabolically as growth substrate by a mixed bacterial enrichment culture (named SF culture). In this study, the degradation capabilities under a range of field-relevant conditions were investigated in fixed-bed reactors as well as in batch experiments. Aerobic metabolic TCE degradation was stable over the long term, with degradation optima at 22 degrees C and pH 7. Degradation of up to 400 mu M TCE was observed. The longest starvation period after which degradation of TCE was regained was 112 days. The possible co-contaminants perchloroethene, trans-1,2-dichloroethene, and cis-1,2-dichloroethene did not inhibit TCE degradation, even though they were not degraded themselves. The presence of equimolar amounts of 1,1-dichloroethene and vinyl chloride inhibited ICE degradation. Experiments with groundwater from different chloroethene-contaminated field sites proved the potential of the SF culture for bioaugmentation. Thus, aerobic metabolic TCE degradation should be considered as a promising method for the bioremediation of field sites with TCE as the main contaminant. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study assessed the efficiency of utilizing mixed culture bacteria (MCB) incorporated with individual nanoparticles (NPs), i.e., hematite (alpha-Fe2O3), nickel oxide (NiO), and zinc oxide (ZnO), dual NPs (alpha-Fe2O3 + NiO, alpha-Fe2O3 + ZnO, and NiO + ZnO), and multi-NPs (alpha-Fe2O3 + NiO + ZnO) for hydrogen production (HP) from industrial wastewater containing mono-ethylene glycol (MEG). When MCB was individually supplemented with alpha-Fe2O3(200 mg/L), NiO (20 mg/L), and ZnO NPs (10 mg/L), HP improved significantly by 41, 30, and 29%, respectively. Further, key enzymes associated with MEG metabolism, such as alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), and hydrogenase (hyd), were rapidly and substantially enhanced in the medium. NiO and ZnO NPs notably promoted ADH and ALDH activities, respectively, while alpha-Fe2O3 exhibited superior impact on hyd activity. Maximum hydrogen production rate was concomitant with higher acetic acid production and lower residual acetaldehyde and ethanol. HP using MCB supplemented with individual NiO (20 mg/L) and ZnO NPs (10 mg/L) further improved by 8.0%-14% when dual and multi-NPs were used; the highest HP was recorded when multi NPs were used. In addition, NPs incorporation resulted in substantial increase in the relative abundance of Clostridiales (belonging to family Clostridiaceae; > 83%). Overall, this study provides significant insights into the impact of NPs on hydrogen production from MEG-contaminated wastewater. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Arsenite removal without thioarsenite formation in a sulfidogenic system

AB Sulfidogenic process using sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) has been used to remove arsenite from the arsenic-contaminated waters through the precipitation of arsenite with sulfide. However, excessive sulfide production and significant pH increase induced by sulfate reduction result in the formation of the mobile thioarsenite by-products and the inefficiency and instability of arsenite removal, especially when the arsenite level fluctuates. In this study, we proposed a novel sulfidogenic process driven by sulfur reducing bacteria ((SRB)-R-0) for the arsenite removal under acidic conditions. In a long term experiment, efficient sulfide production (0.42 +/- 0.2 kg S/m(3)-d) was achieved without changing the acidic condition (pH around 4.3) in a sulfur reduction bio-reactor. With the acidic sulfide-containing effluents from the bio-reactor, over 99% of arsenite (10 mg As/L) in the arsenic-contaminated water was precipitated without the formation of soluble thioarsenite by-products, even in the presence of excessive sulfide. Maintaining the acidic condition (pH around 4.3) of the sulfide-containing effluent was essential to ensure the efficient arsenite precipitation and minimize the formation of thioarsenite by-products when the arsenite to sulfide molar ratios ranged from 0.1 to 0.46. An acid-tolerant (SRB)-R-0, Desulfurella, was found to be responsible for the efficient dissimilatory sulfur reduction under acidic conditions without changing the solution pH significantly. The microbial sulfur reduction may proceed through the direct electron transfer between the S RB and sulfur particles, and also through the indirect electron transport mediated by electron carriers. The findings of this study demonstrate that the proposed sulfidogenic process driven by S RB working under acidic conditions can be a promising alternative to the SRB-based process for arsenite removal from the arsenic-contaminated waters.

AB While wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents have become increasingly recognized as a stressor for receiving rivers, their effects on river microbial communities remain elusive. Moreover, global change is increasing the frequency and duration of desiccation events in river networks, and we ignore how desiccation might influence the response of microbial communities to WWTP effluents. In this study, we evaluated the interaction between desiccation events and WWTP effluents under different dilution capacities. Specifically, we used artificial streams in a replicated regressional design, exposing first a section of the streams to a 7-day desiccation period and then the full stream to different levels of a realistic WWTP effluent dilution, from 0% to 100% of WWTP effluent proportion of the total stream flow. The microbial community response was assessed by means of high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons and quantitative PCR targeting ecologically-relevant microbial groups. Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) was used, together with model fitting, to determine community thresholds and potential indicator taxa. Results show significant interactions between WWTP effluents and desiccation, particularly when sediment type is considered. Indicator taxa included members of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria, with abrupt changes in community structure at WWTP effluent proportion of the total flow above 50%, which is related to nutrient levels ranging 4.6-5.2 mg N-NO3- L-1, 0.21-032 mg P-PO43- L-1 and 7.09-9.00 mg DOC L-1. Our work indicates that situations where WWTP effluents account for >50% of the total river flow might risk of dramatic microbial community structure changes and should be avoided.

AB The strong greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) can be emitted from wastewater treatment systems as a byproduct of ammonium oxidation and as the last intermediate in the stepwise reduction of nitrate to N-2 by denitrifying organisms. A potential strategy to reduce N2O emissions would be to enhance the activity of N2O reductase (NOS) in the denitrifying microbial community. A survey of existing literature on denitrification in wastewater treatment systems showed that the N2O reducing capacity (VmaxN2O -> N2) exceeded the capacity to produce N2O (VmaxN2O -> N2) by a factor of 2-10. This suggests that denitrification can be an effective sink for N2O, potentially scavenging a fraction of the N2O produced by ammonium oxidation or abiotic reactions. We conducted a series of incubation experiments with freshly sampled activated sludge from a wastewater treatment system in Oslo and found that the ratio alpha = VmaxN2O -> N2/V(max)NO3 -> N2O fluctuated between 2 and 5 in samples taken at intervals over a period of 5 weeks. Adding a cocktail of carbon substrates resulted in increasing rates, but had no significant effect on a. Based on these results complemented with qPCR and metaproteomic data we discuss whether the overcapacity to reduce N2O can be ascribed to gene/protein abundance ratios (nosZ/nir), or whether in cell competition between the reductases for electrons could be of greater importance.

AB Currently, the effects of high antibiotic concentrations on the performance of microbiota and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in activated sludge (AS) process are not well characterized. Lab-scale batch reactors were performed to evaluate the dynamics of microbial community and ARGs in response to six antibiotics at different concentrations using high-throughput sequencing-based 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic analyses. The presence of antibiotics remarkably decreased the microbial diversity, caused a great change of the microbiota structure, and exerted a selective pressure on the enrichment of potential antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), such as Arthrobacter, Thauera, Geothrix, Rudaea, Aridibacter, Conexibacter, Terrimonas, etc. High antibiotic selective pressures increased ARC abundance but simultaneously reduced ARG number. In total, 491 ARG subtypes belonging to 20 ARG types were detected and kanamycin treatment showed the highest ARG abundances. A core set of 54 ARG subtypes that accounted for 66.7%-99.6% of the total ARG abundances were shared by all samples. The increase of the abundances of both corresponding and non-corresponding ARGs under a specific antibiotic treatment revealed the collateral effects of antibiotic selective pressure. Microbial community may play an important role in the composition of ARGs. Network analysis indicated that both internal-type and external-type of ARGs exhibited higher non-random co-occurrence incidences and 18 genera were speculated as the possible hosts for multiple ARGs. This study deciphered the profiles and relationships between microbial community and ARGs in AS process treating wastewater with high antibiotic concentrations and could provide helpful guidance for controlling the development and dissemination of ARB and ARGs.

AB Permanganate has been used traditionally in drinking water treatment for its oxidation properties and ease of use. The concentration of permanganate in treatment conditions is low and difficult to detect. A colorimetric method using diethylphenylene diamine (DPD) oxidation to measure low levels (i.e., less than 6 mu M) of permanganate in water was developed and applied to quantify permanganate scavenging by dissolved organic matter (DOM). Manganese dioxide (MnO2) particles were shown to interfere with DPD oxidation; however, particles were removed effectively using 0.1 mu m PVDF filters prior to reaction with DPD. DOM and complexed-Mn(III) were concluded to not interfere with the DPD reaction. The DPD method was validated by obtaining the second-order rate constant for permanganate reaction with phenol (1.7 +/- 0.2 M-1 s(-1)), and comparing to the rate constant obtained independently by monitoring phenol degradation (i.e., UPLC-UV) (1.6 +/- 0.2 M-1 s(-1)). Permanganate reaction with DOM isolate samples did not follow pseudo-first order kinetics. Faster reaction rates were observed with higher ionic strength (1 mM versus 5 mM carbonate). No change in reaction rates with pH was observed at lower ionic strength (1 mM); while at higher ionic strength, the reaction rate was faster at pH 7 than at pH 10. In contrast, linear kinetics were observed for permanganate reaction with DOM in filtered whole water samples. These samples showed similar trends with pH and ionic strength as for DOM isolates. The presented method is valid to quantify permanganate reaction rates with organic contaminants or with natural scavengers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, MnO2-coated Fe3O4 nanocomposite (Fe3O4 @MnO2) was utilized to decompose H2O2 to remove dyes via advanced oxidation processes and adsorptive bubble separation (advanced ABS system). The combination of H2O2 and Fe3O4@MnO2 generated bubbles and formed a stable foam layer in the presence of a surfactant; sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), separating dye from the solution. On the basis of radical quenching experiments, electron paramagnetic resonance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, it was confirmed that the MnO2 shell of catalyst was reduced to Mn(2)o(3) by H2O2, generating radicals and oxygen gas for the removal of dyes. In the advanced ABS system, .OH and O-1(2) were the main radical species and the O-2 concentrations of 0.34 and 0.71 mM were increased in the solution and headspace, respectively. The advanced ABS system demonstrated a high removal efficiency of methylene blue (MB) (99.0%) and the removal rate increased with increasing amounts of components (H2O2, catalyst and SDS). Also, the advanced ABS system maintained high removal efficiency of MB at a wide pH range of 3-9. In addition to the anionic surfactant of SDS, CTAC was applied as a cationic surfactant for the advanced ABS of anionic dyes. Lastly, the scale-up system was applied to remediate dye-contaminated river water and industrial wastewater for possible practical applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Predicting bacterial levels in watersheds in response to agricultural beneficial management practices (BMPs) requires understanding the germane processes at both the watershed and field scale. Controlling subsurface tile drainage (CTD) is a highly effective BMP at reducing nutrient losses from fields, and watersheds when employed en masse, but little work has been conducted on CTD effects on bacterial loads and densities in a watershed context. This study compared fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) [E. colt, Enterococcus, Fecal coliform, Total coliform, Clostridium perfringensj densities and unit area loads (UAL) from a pair of flat tile-drained watersheds (similar to 250-467 ha catchment areas) during the growing season over a 10-year monitoring period, using a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design (i.e., test CTD watershed vs. reference uncontrolled tile drainage (UCTD) watershed during a pre CTD intervention period and a CTD-intervention period where the test CTD watershed had cm deployed on over 80% of the fields). With no tile drainage management, upstream tile drainage to ditches comprised similar to 90% of total ditch discharge. We also examined FIB loads from a subset of tile drained fields to determine field load contributions to the watershed drainage ditches. Statistical evidence of a CTD effect on FIB UAL in the surface water systems was not strong; however, there was statistical evidence of increased FIB densities [pronounced when E. coli >200 most probable number (MPN) 100 mL(-1)] in the test CTD watershed during the CTD-intervention period. This was likely a result of reduced dilution/flushing in the test CTD watershed ditch due to CTD significantly decreasing the amount of tile drainage water entering the surface water system. Tile E. coli load contributions to the ditches were low; for example, during the 6-yr CTD-intervention period they amounted to on average only similar to 3 and similar to 9% of the ditch loads for the test CTD and reference UCTD watersheds, respectively. This suggests in-stream, or off-field FIB reservoirs and bacteria mobilization drivers, dominated ditch E. coli loads in the watersheds during the growing season. Overall, this study suggested that decision making regarding deployment of CTD en masse in tile-fed watersheds should consider drainage practice effects on bacterial densities and loads, as well as CTD's documented capacity to boost crop yields and reduce seasonal nutrient pollution.

AB Sunlight inactivation is important for disinfection of viruses in sunlit waters. As such, attempts have been made to predict the endogenous photoinactivation rate of bacteriophage MS2 using biological weighting functions, which describe microorganism sensitivity to sunlight inactivation as a function of wavelength. In this study, four biological weighting function models were compared to assess their ability to predict endogenous inactivation rates (k(endo)) of MS2. Previously-published and newly-collected datasets consisting of an incident irradiance spectrum (used as an input to the model) and a measured inactivation rate (k(obs)) were used for model validation and comparison. k(endo) values predicted by each model were compared with measured k(obs) to evaluate the ability of each biological weighting function to predict endogenous sunlight inactivation rates. A model previously developed by Mattle et al. (Env. Sci. TechnoL. 49, 334-342) over-predicted inactivation rates, whereas the other three models - a model from Fisher et al. (Env. Sd. TechnoL 45, 9249-9255), a new model developed in this study, and a modification of the model by Mattle et al. (developed as part of this study) - were better able to estimate inactivation rates. The biological relevance of the spectral shape of each biological weighting function is discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Transformation of biomarkers (or their stability) during sewer transport is an important issue for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). Most studies so far have been conducted in the laboratory, which usually employed unrealistic conditions. In the present study, we utilized a pilot sewer system including a gravity pipe and a rising main pipe to investigate the fate of 24 pharmaceutical biomarkers. A programmable logic controller was used to control and monitor the system including sewer operational conditions and wastewater properties. Sequential samples were collected that can represent hydraulic retention time (HRT) of up to 8 h in a rising main and 4 h in a gravity sewer. Wastewater parameters and biomarker concentrations were analysed to evaluate the stability and transformation kinetics. The wastewater parameters of the pilot system were close to the conditions of real sewers. The findings of biomarker transformation were also close to real sewer data with seventeen biomarkers reported as stable while buprenorphine, caffeine, ethyl-sulfate, methadone, paracetamol, paraxanthine and salicylic acid degraded to variable extents. Both zero-order and first-order kinetics were used to model the degradation of unstable biomarkers and interestingly the goodness of fit R-2 for the zero-order model was higher than the first-order model for all unstable biomarkers in the rising main. The pilot sewer system simulates more realistic conditions than benchtop laboratory setups and may provide a more accurate approach for assessing the in-sewer transformation kinetics and stability of biomarkers.

AB Septic systems inherently rely on microbial communities in the septic tank and leach field to attenuate pollution from household sewage. Operating conditions of septic leach field systems, especially the degree of water saturation, are likely to impact microbial biogeochemical cycling, including carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P), as well as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere. To study the impact of flooding on microbial methane (CH4) and nutrient cycling, two leach field soil columns were constructed. One system was operated as designed and the other was operated in both flooded and well-maintained conditions. CH4 emissions were significantly higher in flooded soils (with means between 0.047 and 0.33 g CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) as compared to well-drained soils (means between 0.0025 and 0.004 g CH4 m(-2) d(-1)). Subsurface CH4 profiles were also elevated under flooded conditions and peaked near the wastewater inlet. Gene abundances of mcrA, a biomarker for methanogens, were also greatest near the wastewater inlet. In contrast, gene abundances of pmoA, a biomarker for methanotrophs, were greatest in surface soils at the interface of CH4 produced subsurface and atmospheric oxygen. 16S rRNA, mcrA, and pmoA amplicon library sequencing revealed microbial community structure in the soil columns differed from that of the original soils and was driven largely by CH4 fluxes and soil VWC. Additionally, active microbial populations differed from those present at the gene level. Flooding did not appear to affect N or P removals in the soil columns (between 75 and 99% removal). COD removal was variable throughout the experiment, and was negatively impacted by flooding. Our study shows septic system leach field soils are dynamic environments where CH4 and nutrients are actively cycled by microbial populations. Our results suggest proper siting, installation, and routine maintenance of leach field systems is key to reducing the overall impact of these systems on water and air quality. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The hydrated electron (e(aq)(-))-based reduction processes are promising for removing organic pollutants in water engineering systems. The reductive kinetics, especially the second order rate constants (k(eaq-)) of e(aq)(-) with organic compounds, is important for evaluating and modeling the advanced reduction processes. In this study, the k(eaq-) values for aliphatic compounds and phenyl-based compounds are, for the first time, modeled by the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) method. The structural features governing the reactivity of two classes of organic compounds toward e(aq)(-) were revealed, and the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (E-LUMO), one-electron reduction potential (E-RED) and polarizability (alpha) were found to be the important molecular parameters in both two models. The built QSAR models provide robust predictive tools for estimating the removal of emerging pollutants using e(aq)(-) during wastewater treatment processes. Additionally, quantum chemical calculations were employed to probe into the mechanism and feasibility of the single electron transfer (SET) pathway in the e(aq)(-)-based reduction process. The thermodynamic investigation suggests that the compounds with electron-withdrawing groups tend to possess higher k(eaq-) and lower Gibbs free energy (Delta G(SET)) and Gibbs free energies of activation (Delta double dagger G(SET)(center dot)) than the ones with electron-donating groups, indicating the SET process occurs more readily. It is also found that the refractory halogenated compounds can achieve dehalogenation via the SET pathway. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Seawater desalination facilities continuously discharge hyper-saline brine into the coastal environment which often flows as a concentrated plume over the seafloor, hence possibly impacting benthic micro-organisms. Yet, the effects of brine discharge from desalination plants on benthic bacteria, key players in biodegradation of organic material and nutrient recycling is unknown. In this study, we tested the chronic (years) effects of brine discharge from three large-scale desalination facilities on the abundance, metabolic activity and community composition of benthic bacteria. To this end, four sampling campaigns were carried at the outfall areas of the Ashkelon, Sorek and Hadera desalination facilities. The effects of the brine were compared to corresponding reference stations which were not influenced by the brine (i.e., water temperature and salinity). Our sampling data indicate that bacterial abundance and activity that includes bacterial growth efficiency were 1.3-2.6-fold higher at the outfall area than the reference station. Concomitant analysis pointed out that the bacterial community structure at the brine discharge area was also different than the reference station, yet varied between each desalination facility. Our results demonstrate that the impact of brine effluent from desalination facilities on benthic bacteria are site-specific and localized (<1.4 Km(2)) around the discharge point. Namely, that the effects on benthic bacteria are prominent at the brine mixing zone and change according to the discharge method used to disperse the brine as well as local stressors (e.g., eutrophication and elevated water temperature). Our results contribute new insights on the effects of desalination-brine to benthic microbes, while providing scientifically-based aspects on the ecological impacts of brine dispersion for decision makers.

AB Cyanobacterial bloom events that produce natural toxins occur in freshwaters across the globe, yet the potential risk of many cyanobacterial metabolites remains mostly unknown. Only microcystins, one class of cyanopeptides, have been studied intensively and the wealth of evidence regarding exposure concentrations and toxicity led to their inclusion in risk management frameworks for water quality. However, cyanobacteria produce an incredible diversity of hundreds of cyanopeptides beyond the class of microcystins. The question arises, whether the other cyanopeptides are in fact of no human and ecological concern or whether these compounds merely received (too) little attention thus far. Current observations suggest that an assessment of their (eco)toxicological risk is indeed relevant: First, other cyanopeptides, including cyanopeptolins and anabaenopeptins, can occur just as frequently and at similar nanomolar concentrations as microcystins in surface waters. Second, cyanopeptolins, anabaenopeptins, aeruginosins and microginins inhibit proteases in the nanomolar range, in contrast to protein phosphatase inhibition by microcystins. Cyanopeptolins, aeruginosins, and aerucyclamide also show toxicity against grazers in the micromolar range comparable to microcystins. The key challenge for a comprehensive risk assessment of cyanopeptides remains their large structural diversity, lack of reference standards, and high analytical requirements for identification and quantification. One way forward would be a prevalence study to identify the priority candidates of tentatively abundant, persistent, and toxic cyanopeptides to make comprehensive risk assessments more manageable.

AB Eutrophication or excessive nutrient richness is an impairment of many freshwater ecosystems and a prominent cause of harmful algal blooms. It is generally accepted that nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients are the primary causative factor, however, for systems subject to large anthropogenic perturbation, this may no longer be true, and the role of micronutrients is often overlooked. Here we report a study on Lake Tai (Taihu), a large, spatially diverse and hypereutrophic lake in China. We performed small-scale mesocosm nutrient limitation bioassays using boron, iron, cobalt, copper, molybdenum, nitrogen and phosphorus on phytoplankton communities sampled from different locations in Taihu to test the relative effects of micronutrients on in situ algal assemblages. In addition to commonly-used methods of chemical and biological analysis (including algal phytoplankton counting), we used flow cytometry coupled with data-driven analysis to monitor changes to algal assemblages. We found statistically significant effects of limitation or co-limitation for boron, cobalt, copper and iron. For copper at one location chlorophyll-a was over four times higher for amendment with copper, nitrogen and phosphorous than for the latter two alone. Since copper is often proposed as amendment for the environmental management of harmful algal blooms, this result is significant. We have three primary conclusions: first, the strong effects for Cu that we report here are mutually consistent across chlorophyll-a results, count data, and results determined from a data-driven approach to flow cytometry. Given that we cannot rule out a role for a Fe-Cu homeostatic link in causing these effects, future research into MNs and how they interact with N, P, and other MNs should be pursued to explore new interventions for effective management of HABs. Second, in view of the stimulatory effect that Cu exhibited, management of HABs with Cu as an algal biocide may not always be advisable. Third, our approach to flow cytometry offers data confirming our results from chemical and biological analysis, however also holds promise for future development as a high-throughput tool for use in understanding changes in algal assemblages. The results from this study concur with a small and emerging body of literature suggesting that the potential role of micro-nutrients in eutrophication requires further consideration in environmental management.

AB Acid mine drainage (AMD) has been recognized as a major challenge to the global mining industry due to its environmental consequences. Lime neutralization has been a traditional treatment for AMD, but the abundance of iron and sulfate in AMD usually renders it ineffective by forming iron hydroxide and gypsum precipitate coating on the surface of lime. In light of ubiquitous biological mineralization phenomena present at AMD sites, a rapid chemical mineralization was developed to reduce iron and sulfate and recovery of iron from AMD prior to lime neutralization. Through a cyclic reduction-oxidation process by the addition of iron powder and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), over 90% Fe3+ and 40% SO42- could be removed beforehand by forming schwertmannite. The pretreated AMD drastically reduced both the required lime slurry in the subsequent lime neutralization process and the amount of neutralized sludge. The resultant schwertmannite had a specific surface area of 3.9 m(2)/g and a formula of Fe8O8(OH)(4.5)(SO4)(1.75). This technique could reduce lime consumption, increase metal level in neutralized sludge, and harvest environmentally friendly materials. These results demonstrate that the integrated chemical mineralization and lime neutralization treatment is expected to be widely used in practical application. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Robust nonlinear processing of active array data in inverse scattering
   via truncated reduced order models

   elastic, electromagnetic waves
ID WAVE-FORM INVERSION; GELFAND-LEVITAN; LANCZOS-ALGORITHM; MARCHENKO;
   EQUATIONS; SCHEME
AB We introduce a novel algorithm for nonlinear processing of data gathered by an active array of sensors which probes a medium with pulses and measures the resulting waves. The algorithm is motivated by the application of array imaging. We describe it for a generic hyperbolic system that applies to acoustic, electromagnetic or elastic waves in a scattering medium modeled by an unknown coefficient called the reflectivity. The goal of imaging is to invert the nonlinear mapping from the reflectivity to the array data. Many existing imaging methodologies ignore the nonlinearity i.e., operate under the assumption that the Born (single scattering) approximation is accurate. This leads to image artifacts when multiple scattering is significant. Our algorithm seeks to transform the array data to those corresponding to the Born approximation, so it can be used as a pre-processing step for any linear inversion method. The nonlinear data transformation algorithm is based on a reduced order model defined by a proxy wave propagator operator that has four important properties. First, it is data driven, meaning that it is constructed from the data alone, and it requires only a rough estimate of the background velocity (kinematics). Second, it can be factorized in two operators that have an approximately affine dependence on the unknown reflectivity. This allows the computation of the Frechet derivative of the reflectivity to the data mapping which gives the Born approximation. Third, the algorithm involves regularization which balances numerical stability and data fitting with accuracy of the order of the standard deviation of additive data noise. Fourth, the algebraic nature of the algorithm makes it applicable to scalar (acoustic) and vectorial (elastic, electromagnetic) wave data without any specific modifications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB The wave-modes in isotropic elastic media are easy to get separated by using Helmholtz decomposition. This method, however, fails in TI (transverse isotropic) media due to the anisotropy, and more sophisticated operators are required. Most of these existing operators are implemented and limited in FD (finite-difference) stencil. We propose a Poynting-vector based method, which separates wave-modes pointwisely, independent of the modeling stencils. In TI media, the Poynting-vector indicates the group-velocity direction while the wave-modes get separated in the polarization-vector direction. We write the relationship between these two directions into a small numerical table by exploiting the phase-velocity direction as a bridge prior to wavefield propagation. During the modeling process, it is easy to estimate the group-velocity direction from the Poynting vector, and then we can get the polarization-vector direction to separate wave-modes by checking the numerical table. We test our method on several TI models. We furthermore apply our method to elastic reverse-time migration (RTM) in TI media. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID CONVERGENCE
AB Wave propagation problems for heterogeneous media are known to have many applications in physics and engineering. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in stochastic effects due to the uncertainty, which may arise from impurities of the media. This work considers a two-dimensional wave equation with random coefficients which may be discontinuous in space. Generalized polynomial chaos method is used in conjunction with stochastic Galerkin approximation, and local discontinuous Galerkin method is used for spatial discretization. Our method is shown to be energy preserving in semi-discrete form as well as in fully discrete form, when leap-frog time discretization is used. Its convergence rate is proved to be optimal and the error grows linearly in time. The theoretical properties of the proposed scheme are validated by numerical tests. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB We present novel algorithms for cell-based adaptive mesh refinement on unstructured meshes of triangles on graphics processing units. Our implementation makes use of improved memory management techniques and a coloring algorithm for avoiding race conditions. Both the solver and AMR algorithms are entirely implemented on the GPU, with negligible communication between device and host. We show that the overhead of the AMR subroutines is small compared to the high order solver and that the proportion of total runtime spent adaptively refining the mesh decreases with the order of approximation. We apply our code to a number of benchmark problems as well as more recently proposed problems for the Euler equations that require extremely high resolution. We present the solution to a shock reflection problem that addresses the von Neumann triple point paradox with an accurately computed triple point location. Finally, we present the first solution on the full Euler equations to the problem of shock disappearance and self-similar diffraction of weak shocks around thin films.

AB Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) is a widely adopted non-reflecting boundary treatment for wave simulations. Reducing numerical reflections from a discretized PML has been a long lasting challenge. This paper presents a new discrete PML for the multi-dimensional scalar wave equation which produces no numerical reflection at all. The reflectionless discrete PML is discovered through a straightforward derivation using Discrete Complex Analysis. The resulting PML takes an easily-implementable finite difference form with compact stencil. In practice, the discrete waves are damped exponentially in the PML, and the error due to domain truncation is maintained at machine zero by a moderately thick PML. The numerical stability of the proposed PML is also demonstrated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The polynomial chaos (PC) expansion has been widely used as a surrogate model in the Bayesian inference to speed up the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) calculations. However, the use of a PC surrogate introduces the modeling error, that may severely distort the estimate of the posterior distribution. This error can be corrected by increasing the order of the PC expansion, but the cost for building the surrogate may increase dramatically. In this work, we seek to address this challenge by proposing an adaptive procedure to construct a multi-fidelity PC surrogate. This new strategy combines (a large number of) low-fidelity surrogate model evaluations and (a small number of) high-fidelity model evaluations, yielding a locally adaptive multi-fidelity approach. Here the low-fidelity surrogate is chosen as the prior-based PC surrogate, while the high-fidelity model refers to the true forward model. The key idea is to construct and refine the multi-fidelity approach over a sequence of samples adaptively determined from data so that the approximation can eventually concentrate on the posterior distribution. We illustrate the performance of the proposed strategy through two nonlinear inverse problems. It is shown that the proposed adaptive multi-fidelity approach can improve significantly the accuracy, yet without a dramatic increase in computational complexity. The numerical results also indicate that our new algorithm can enhance the efficiency by several orders of magnitude compared to a standard MCMC approach using only the true forward model.

AB In this work, we combine the idea of data-driven polynomial chaos expansions with the weighted least-square approach to solve uncertainty quantification (UQ) problems. The idea of data-driven polynomial chaos is to use statistical moments of the input random variables to develop an arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion, and then use such data-driven bases to perform UQ computations. Here we adopt the bases construction procedure by following (Ahlfeld et al. (2016), [1]), where the bases are computed by using matrix operations on the Hankel matrix of moments. Different from previous works, in the postprocessing part, we propose a weighted least-squares approach to solve UQ problems. This approach includes a sampling strategy and a least-squares solver. The main features of our approach are two folds: On one hand, our sampling strategy is independent of the random input. More precisely, we propose to sampling with the equilibrium measure, and this measure is also independent of the data-driven bases. Thus, this procedure can be done in prior (or in a off-line manner). On the other hand, we propose to solve a Christoffel function weighted least-square problem, and this strategy is quasi-linearly stable - the required number of PDE solvers depends linearly (up to a logarithmic factor) on the number of (data-driven) bases. This new approach is thus promising in dealing with a class of problems with epistemic uncertainties. A number of numerical tests are presented to show the effectiveness of our approach.

AB The closest point method (Ruuth and Merriman (2008) [32]) is an embedding method developed to solve a variety of partial differential equations (PDEs) on smooth surfaces, using a closest point representation of the surface and standard Cartesian grid methods in the embedding space. Recently, a closest point method with explicit time-stepping was proposed that uses finite differences derived from radial basis functions (RBF-FD). Here, we propose a least-squares implicit formulation of the closest point method to impose the constant-along-normal extension of the solution on the surface into the embedding space. Our proposed method is particularly flexible with respect to the choice of the computational grid in the embedding space. In particular, we may compute over a computational tube that contains problematic nodes. This fact enables us to combine the proposed method with the grid based particle method (Leung and Zhao (2009) [37]) to obtain a numerical method for approximating PDEs on moving surfaces. We present a number of examples to illustrate the numerical convergence properties of our proposed method. Experiments for advection-diffusion equations and Cahn-Hilliard equations that are strongly coupled to the velocity of the surface are also presented. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID ESSENTIALLY NONOSCILLATORY SCHEMES; EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATION
AB In this paper, a novel mapping approach through the use of adaptive mapping functions is introduced for high order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) methods. The new class of adaptive mapping functions are designed to adjust themselves to the solution based on a simple parameter calculated using the smoothness indicators that are readily available during computation. It is shown that this adaptive nature allows the resultant mapped WENO scheme to maintain sub-stencil weights close to the optimal weights in smooth regions without amplifying the weights of non-smooth stencils containing discontinuities. Therefore, adaptive mapping achieves enhanced accuracy in smooth regions and is more resistant against spurious oscillations near discontinuities. Taylor series analysis of the seventh order finite volume WENO scheme has been performed to demonstrate the loss of accuracy of the original WENO method near critical points. The convergence rates of the seventh order finite volume WENO scheme with adaptive mapping have been shown through a simple numerical example. Excellent results have been obtained for one-dimensional linear advection cases especially over long output times. Improved results have also been obtained for one- and two-dimensional Euler equation test cases. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a new finite difference shock-capturing scheme for hyperbolic equations on static uniform grids. The method provides selectable high-order accuracy by employing a kernel-based Gaussian Process (GP) data prediction method which is an extension of the GP high-order method originally introduced in a finite volume framework by the same authors. The method interpolates Riemann states to high order, replacing the conventional polynomial interpolations with polynomial-free GP-based interpolations. For shocks and discontinuities, this GP interpolation scheme uses a nonlinear shock handling strategy similar to Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO), with a novelty consisting in the fact that nonlinear smoothness indicators are formulated in terms of the Gaussian likelihood of the local stencil data, replacing the conventional L-2-type smoothness indicators of the original WENO method. We demonstrate that these GP-based smoothness indicators play a key role in the new algorithm, providing significant improvements in delivering high - and selectable - order accuracy in smooth flows, while successfully delivering non-oscillatory solution behavior in discontinuous flows.

AB Sensitivity Analysis (SA) and Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) are important components of modern numerical analysis. However, solving the relevant tasks involving large-scale fluid flow models currently remains a serious challenge. The difficulties are associated with the computational cost of running such models and with large dimensions of the discretized model input. The common approach is to construct a metamodel - an inexpensive approximation to the original model suitable for the Monte Carlo simulations. The polynomial chaos (PC) expansion is the most popular approach for constructing metamodels. Some fluid flow models of interest are involved in the process of variational estimation/data assimilation. This implies that the tangent linear and adjoint counterparts of such models are available and, therefore, computing the gradient (first derivative) and the Hessian (second derivative) of a given function of the state variables is possible. New techniques for SA and UQ which benefit from using the derivatives are presented in this paper. The gradient-enhanced regression methods for computing the PC expansion have been developed recently. An intrinsic step of the regression method is a minimization process. It is often assumed that generating 'data' for the regression problem is significantly more expensive that solving the regression problem itself. This depends, however, on the size of the importance set, which is a subset of 'influential' inputs. A distinguishing feature of the distributed parameter models is that the number of the such inputs could still be large, which means that solving the regression problem becomes increasingly expensive. In this paper we propose a derivative-enhanced projection method, where no minimization is required. The method is based on the explicit relationships between the PC coefficients and the derivatives, complemented with a relatively inexpensive filtering procedure. The method is currently limited to the PC expansion of the third order. Besides, we suggest an improved derivative-based global sensitivity measure. The numerical tests have been performed for the Burger's model. The results confirm that the low-order PC expansion obtained by our method represents a useful tool for modeling the non-gaussian behavior of the chosen quantity of interest (QoI).

AB We present in this paper a novel numerical method for the simulation of time-dependent, diluted spray combustion problems. Spray combustion is a complex numerical problem owing to the diversity of the phenomena (convection, diffusion, heat transfer, vaporization of droplets and chemical reaction) and the disparity of the scales involved. Our model considers a large number of tiny droplets (liquid phase) surrounded by a gas flow (gas phase), making up a special two-phase system where droplet interaction is neglected on account of the much larger inter-droplet distance compared to the droplet radius typically found in burners. The mathematical formulation of the problem follows a hybrid, Eulerian-Lagrangian approach: the continuous, gas phase is ruled by the conservation equations of mass, momentum, species mass fractions and energy, while the liquid phase is described by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODE) that govern the properties of each droplet along its fluid trajectory. For the resolution of the conservation equations of the gas phase, a Lagrange-Galerkin method in an anisotropic adaptive finite element framework is used. In combination with the aforementioned Lagrange-Galerkin methodology we apply a second order Explicit Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev scheme, also useful to solve the ODE systems of equations for the droplets movement. Explicit Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev preserves numerical stability while also facilitating a decoupled calculation of the unknown variables of the gas and liquid phases, a most beneficial feature from a computationally point of view. Finally, we show several examples to highlight the capabilities of our numerical algorithm in canonical and real-world configurations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Many physical phenomena are localized in space, where physical quantities of interest extend to large distances (effectively to infinity) where they vanish smoothly. Thus, its modeling necessitates the imposition of vanishing boundary conditions (BCs) to the formulated differential equations (DEs). Numerical solutions for such DEs can be complicated as they involve operations on physical quantities expanding infinitely in space. Currently, many approaches have been implemented in this context, where they mostly use techniques like domain truncation, using functions intrinsic to unbounded domains, and domain transformation. However, since the actual solutions have a decaying nature, solving such problems with high accuracy and efficiency while taking into consideration a wide range of decaying rates and oscillation frequencies is a major challenge. In this work, we present an efficient high-order method, based on Galerkin method, to solve DEs in unbounded domains using properly designed domain transformations where the physical unbounded domain (-infinity, infinity) is mapped into a computational bounded domain (0, 1). The mapped sine series is then used to solve the differential equation in the computational domain (0, 1) where the vanishing quantities at infinities are mapped to 0 (corresponding to physical -infinity) and 1 (corresponding to physical infinity). The designed transformations maintain the orthogonality in both physical and computational spaces. Moreover, using sine series basis allows - in most cases - analytical integrations. For verification, the proposed method is applied to solve 1) Helmholtz equation in one-dimension, where the exact solutions for various cases (decaying exponential or algebraic function) are known, and 2) three-dimensional Schrodinger wave equation with harmonic oscillator. For the Helmholtz problem, the error in the approximate solution was less than 10(-40) using 100 basis functions, while for the second problem, the error is less than 10(-25) using the same number of bases. All results and the analyses demonstrate how the properly designed mapped basis sets can be used to develop efficient high-order methods to solve DEs with vanishing boundary conditions and with wide range of decaying rates and oscillation frequencies simultaneously.

AB Nanofiber-coated hybrid yarn not only exhibited the performance advantages of coating nanofiber-layer, but also possessed the structural feature of core layer, which could endow it excellent application prospect. Previous studies for fabricating nanofiber-coated hybrid yarn had limitations of poor yarn structure and discontinuity, and obtained hybrid yarns with a small strain. Herein, a novel stepped airflow-electrospinning method, in which stepped airflow field could effectively control the movement of nanofibers, was proposed to spin continuous nanofiber-coated hybrid yarn. Interestingly, a highly stretchable nanofiber-coated hybrid yarn with uniform wavy structure was obtained by our designed method, achieving an ultra-high strain of 531.98%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Tantalum has excellent biocompatibility and mechanical properties that can be used as an ideal bone scaffold material. However, its applications have been limited because of its high melting point, affinity to oxygen and cost. In this study, we used an inexpensive tantalum oxide powder as a starting material and developed a method combining gel casting based on 3D printing with electrolysis reduction to fabricate porous tantalum scaffolds. The non-toxic of scaffolds was evaluated. Results showed that the scaffolds facilitated cell proliferation in vitro. The scaffolds have a compressive strength close to a cancellous bone.

AB Viscose stable fibers with excellent electrical conductivity and washing resistance were prepared using the simple and scalable method of soaking and reduction with the employment of graphene oxide and reducing agent. After treatment, viscose stable fibers were evenly coated with reduced graphene oxide and a continuous conductive path was formed accordingly, and exhibited a high electrical conductivity of 1.13 S/m. Besides, the electrical conductivity of treated viscose stable fibers decreased a little after washing tests, and its washing resistance achieved level four according to GB/T 3921-2008(ISO105-C10:2006), while the electrical conductivity of the original viscose stable fibers and viscose stable fibers treated by graphene oxide only were 3.55 x 10(-4) S/m and 1.59 x 10(-3) S/m, respectively. The conductive fibers can be applied in the fields of wearable e-textiles, electromagnetic shielding and anti-static textiles owing to their good electrical conductivity and washing resistance.

The microstructure, metamorphism mechanism and mechanical properties of the eutectic Si of the alloy after adding Mg-15La master alloy were investigated. The results show that high-density nano-cluster particles appear within the eutectic Si after Mg-15La master alloy addition. After adding the master alloy, the eutectic Si morphology changes from strip to fiber or granular. The average length of eutectic Si changed from 6.04 mu m to 1.04 mu m.

In this paper, we utilize reflective digital holographic microscopy (rDHM) to evaluate the mean height between ferrite and martensite phases in dual phase steel (DPS) samples. The data extracted from processing of several digital holograms show that the mean height difference between the phases is reduced for the samples of higher martensite volume fraction. rDHM has the potential to be used for the multi-phase samples that are difficult to be analyzed by conventional metallographic methods.

AB In this paper the rheological behavior of fresh Portland cement pastes mixed with different calcined clays was analyzed. For this purpose, two samples of Portland cement with different mineral composition (one with low C(3)A and high C3S content and another with low C3S and high C(3)A) were used combined with different replacement percentages of two calcined clays (two different metakaolin). Grounded alpha-aquartz was used as control as well. Both mineral admixtures had different crystallinity and morphology: the alpha-quartz is fully crystalline while metakaolin is completely amorphous with a very small crystalline fraction giving very high pozzolanic properties in the vitreous state. All determinations were performed in the hydration latency period. The results show that the fresh Portland cement paste with low C(3)A(%) content and high C3S(%) content present great shear strength and the replacement with calcined clays affects the rheological behavior of the fresh pastes depending on the greater or lower pozzolanic reactivity of the mineral addition.

ID RELEASE; ION
AB Antibacterial modification of Ti implants with silver-loaded coatings is usually challenged by toxic effects from aggregation of silver nanoparticles and lack of control of silver ion release. To overcome these drawbacks, silver nanoparticles were pre-encapsulated in mesoporous silica nanocarriers (MSN) by a sol-gel method, and then homogeneously incorporated into a chitosan coating with the help of electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique. Due to the shielding effect of MSN shell and the stabilization effect of the chitosan matrix, the silver-loaded coating exhibited sustained ion release with excellent antibacterial activity and significantly improved osteoblast cell viability compared to free nanoparticles. This study exploited the capability of EPD on manipulating silver-loaded nanocarrier for biofunctionalization of metallic implants, which is also applicable to a series of drug delivery systems containing other therapeutic elements or biomolecules.

ID MESOPOROUS GEOPOLYMERS
AB The role of the characteristics of raw materials and starting mix proportion on geopolymerization and evolution of zeolitic crystals from an amorphous geopolymeric gel was investigated. Different types and compositions of metakaolin, fly ash, and slag were activated using same waterglass and NaOH-based alkali activator. The test results showed that the reactivity of alkali-activated raw materials greatly depends on the Si/Al and Si/Na ratios of the starting mix, which affected the strength development and zeolite formation. It was further found that low-Ca class F fly ash was the most suitable to obtain zeolite Na-P1 crystals. Alternatively, high-Ca class C fly ash promoted the synthesis of hydroxysodalite and calcite. Higher porosity (52%) and surface area (99.5 m(2)/g) were achieved for the geopolymer-supported zeolites. These materials can be potentially used as membranes/filters for removal of hazardous contaminants (colloidal foulants, macromolecules, heavy metals/radionuclides) from water owing to their porous structure and affinity of zeolites towards cations.

AB In order to obtain the ultraviolet-(UV)-free white light-emitting diodes (W-LEDs), a high-level-Fe-doped p-type ZnO nanowire (NW) array is fabricated on an n-type GaN substrate. An elemental analysis shows a weight ratio of the doped Fe in ZnO of 1.93%. A current-voltage characterization demonstrates that the ZnO:Fe NWs exhibit p-type conductivity. Photoluminescence and electroluminescence measurements demonstrate the formation of Fe-related donor levels (Fe-Zn) and acceptor levels (Fe-Zn-V-Zn pairs). These doping-induced energy levels contribute to prevent the intrinsic ZnO UV emission, and achieve a stable UV-free W-LED with chromaticity coordinates of approximately (0.37, 0.35) and correlated color temperature of approximately 4112 K at bias voltages of 17 V. This study demonstrates the possibility of p-type ZnO by Fe-doping and their potentials for applications in W-LEDs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work, transparent SHP ZnO surface was fabricated via RF magnetron sputtering method. The effect of film thickness and surface roughness on the wettability and optical property of the as-prepared surfaces were investigated. Results show that the as-prepared SHP ZnO surface with sputtering time of 2 min exhibits excellent self-cleaning property and stability against corrosive rain, various environmental temperatures and impacting water droplet with high velocity. The fabrication process is stable and easy to control, which can largely widen the applications of the as-prepared transparent SHP surfaces. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dispersing nanocrystals in solid state matrix is a practical way for the applications in nanodevices, which can yield production of non-agglomerated nanocrystals with good magnetic properties. In this work, Fe3O4 nanocrystals in non-magnetic Al2O3 matrix are synthesized by one-step method. HRTEM analyses confirm the formation of chemical stable Fe3O4 nanocrystals. The finite element calculations and Raman spectra demonstrate that the Fe3O4 nanocrystals experience compressive strain from Al2O3 matrix. Typical magnetic behaviors of weakly interacting Fe3O4 nanocrystals are observed, which are characterized by superparamagnetism. Moreover, the influence of strain on their magnetic properties of the Fe3O4 nanocrystals are also investigated. By utilizing the strain engineering, it paves the ways for the applications of Fe3O4 nanocrystals in magnetic nanodevices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pristine LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) and LNMO@LLTO (Li0.33La0.56TiO3) composites were synthesized by a sol-gel process. The lattice constant of LNMO increases with the increasing coated content of LLTO. All samples show irregular morphologies, and the particle size distributes uniformly between 200 and 500 nm. The inherent characteristic of Li0.33La0.56TiO3 with a large ionic conductivity decreases the interfacial charge transfer impedances, leading to an enhanced migration rate of Li-ions in the composite. As a cathode of LIBs, LNMO@LLTO (3 wt%) exhibits a large reversible capacity and a remarkable rate capability. Therefore, Li0.33La0.56TiO3 modification can be considered as an effective strategy to improve the rate capability of LNMO. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, SnO2 spherical structure was directly deposited on FTO substrate by hydrothermal synthesis. As light absorber, CdS and CdSe nanoparticles were assembled onto the TiCl4-treated SnO2 spherical particles (SnO2(TiO2)) films by using SILAR method. The number of CdS and CdSe deposition cycles that influence the optical and photoelectrochemical performance of the photoelectrodes are evaluated. The best-performed sample is the co-deposition of 5 cycles of CdS and 4 cycles of CdSe on SnO2(TiO2) photoelectrode, and its photocurrent density is about 2.61 mA cm(-2) versus Ag/AgCl at 0 V. The significant photoelectrochemical performance is due to a synergistic contribution from the enhanced light absorption range of the hybrid nanocomposite and the formation of type-II heterostructure, which plays important role in the effective charge separation process. Our results show that CdS/CdSe co-deposition SnO2(TiO2) photoelectrode may have great potential application in photovoltaic field. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present study reports the results of comparative structural and mechanical analysis of highly porous PEEK and UHMWPE biomimetic scaffolds and hybrid scaffolds with bulk "cortical"-like and porous "trabecular"-like layers. A technique for the manufacturing of hydrophilic porous PEEK and UHMWPE was proposed and successfully implemented to create novel bi-polymer hybrid biomimetic PEEK/UHMWPE scaffolds. Thermopressing of polymer-NaCl mixtures and further desalination and surface etching were applied to obtain PEEK and UHMWPE scaffolds, having porosity of more than 60 and 90% vol. and pore sizes of 1-40 mu m and 80-700 mu m, respectively, to imitate the structure of natural cortical and trabecular bone.

Microstructures of the as-prepared porous ceramics were found complex, depicting large-sized spherical pores, circular window pores, and small-sized pores present on internal walls. Effects of temperature on porosity, bulk density, compressive strength, and thermal conductivity were investigated. The thermal conductivity of the samples with a bulk density of 0.65 g/cm(3), a porosity of 86.7%, and a compressive strength of 3.19 MPa was 0.178 W/(m.K), indicating that it can be used in the field of thermal insulation materials.

AB Chemical solution deposition (CSD)-derived near strain-free lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films on a Si substrate were prepared by designing a buffer layer structure. Strain-free PZT thin films with different compositions ranging from Zr/Ti = 50/50 to 58/42 were obtained to demonstrate lattice strain effects on piezoelectric properties. Results show that a near strain-free condition was attained with a SrRuO3 (SRO: 160 nm)/(La-0.5,Sr-0.5)CoO3 (LSCO: 90 nm)/LaNiO3 (LNO: 120 nm)/stacking structure, even on a Si substrate. The highest effective d(33) value of the near strain-free PZT thin film was observed at 53/47 composition, which is the same as bulk materials, although the highest effective d(33) value was obtained from 58/42 composition under the compressive lattice strain condition.

AB Micro-nano CuxO (x = 1 and 2) composite arrays were successfully synthesized on nanoporous copper (np-Cu) via one-step anodic oxidation method. With anodic time prolonging, the surface area and the length of pine-needle CuO clusters increased. The np-Cu/CuxO supported by amorphous layer composite as photocatalyst exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity and cycling stability for the degradation of Rhodamine B. Meanwhile, compared with the difficulties of powders and nanoparticles in recycling, the flexible and free-standing composite makes it easy for recovery of heterogeneous catalysts. The photocatalytic mechanism of np-Cu/CuxO was investigated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nanocrystalline orthorhombic boron nitride (oBN) thin films with an island-in-honeycomb morphology were prepared on graphite substrate by radio frequency (r.f.) magnetron sputtering. The Field emission (FE) measurement results indicated that the FE properties are significantly enhanced in oBN films compared to high quality cBN films, the turn-on electric field of oBN films is decreased from 17.0 V/mu m to 6 V/mu m, and the highest emission current density is increased from 2.8 x 10(-5) to 3 x 10(-4) A/cm(2). The enhanced FE properties of the oBN films can be attributed to significant reduction in effective potential barrier caused by both protruded island-in-honeycomb morphology and honeycomb-like interconnected internal structure.

AB Hexamine-induced co-assembly route has been employed to prepare N-doped ferromagnetic mesoporous carbon nanospheres (Fe-NMCNs) and successfully solve the issue concerning the fast reaction rate of carbon precursor, wherein F127 acts not only as porogen but also as an interface stabilizing agent, and hexamine is utilized as a substitute to release formaldehyde gradually. Luckily, the particle size of the thus-produced Fe-NMCNs can be well tuned by changing the F127 content. More importantly, the Fe-NMCNs-0.4 presents high specific surface area (435.8 cm(2)/g), large pore volume (0.42 cm(3)/g) and good mesoporous structure (ca. 3.2 nm). Moreover, the incorporation of nitrogen and iron imparts it with surface wettability, magnetic property and thermal stability for efficiently removing water pollutants such as dye molecule, especially for basic fuchsin.

AB This work aims at broadening water quenching window for production of hot rolled quenched and partitioned (Q&P) steels. Comparing with conventional researches, a low density steel 0.25C-3Mn-2Al (wt%) was designed to increase the amount of retained austenite (RA) through quenching and non-isothermal partitioning processes. The results indicated that stable amount of RA greater than 19.3% was obtained in the quenching temperature range of similar to 280-360 degrees C, resulting in excellent plasticity similar to 19.2-20.5% in combination with high tensile strength of similar to 1091-1196 MPa. The isothermal transformation was responsible for the stable amount of RA and the CCE model combining with isothermal transformation was used to quantitatively calculate RA. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide was determined in the neutral solution of ZIF-67 crystals. The fast decomposition of H2O2 can be observed by naked eyes in seconds after mixing the reactants. A crumpled surface was observed for ZIF-67 crystals after the decomposition reaction. The decomposition reaction was found to follow the first-order kinetics. Temperature-dependent studies calculated that the activation energy was 37 kJ mol(-1). Based on the obtained results, a possible mechanism was proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The synthesis of catalysts in the lab is typically limited to low mass quantities, and it makes the large quantity production of catalysts a challenge. The High Energy Ball Milling technique allows for the processing of more massive amounts. In this work, we prepared CuPt nanoparticles, and their oxygen reduction catalytic activity was evaluated. The nanoparticles were prepared by galvanic displacement of Cu coming from a High Energy Ball Milling process. Alumina from the wear of the milling vials was present in the catalyst. Hydrodynamic curves from rotating-disk electrode measurements showed a catalytic activity seven times higher on the alloy than that observed on platinum-loaded carbon black. The catalytic activity was not negatively affected by the presence of the Al2O3 impurities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work aims at preparing a novel form-stable composite phase change material (FSPCM), by loading stearic-capric acid (SA-CA) in porous nanoceramics which are employed as the supporting materials. The morphology and microstructure, chemical compatibility, thermal properties and thermal stability are analyzed. The results indicate that the prepared FSPCM freezes at 24.56 degrees C with latent heat capacity of 73.92 J/g and melts at 22.50 degrees C with latent heat capacity of 76.40 J/g. The as-prepared composite is demonstrated to reveal good physicochemistry stability and an acceptable absorption ratio. Moreover, the thermal conductivity of FSPCM is nearly 7 times higher than that of pristine PCM. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work, as-spun polystyrene@polycarbosilane core-shell fibers were firstly fabricated by single-nozzle electrospinning technology. Then, HSiC fibers were successfully obtained after pre-oxidation and pyrolysis. The obtained HSiC fiber mat displayed excellent thermal insulation performance with effective extinction coefficient (e*) of 2350 m(2).kg(-1) and low thermal conductivity of 104.9 mW.(m.K)(1) at 800 degrees C, which were better than those of solid SiC fiber mat.

AB Amorphous Al60Fe20Ti20 and Al65Fe18Ti12Ni5 alloys were produced by mechanical alloying. Thermal behaviour examinations revealed that the crystallisation onset temperatures are 557 degrees C and 539 degrees C for the Al60Fe20Ti20 and the Al65Fe18Ti12Ni5 alloy respectively. The crystallisation products were nanocrystalline tau(2)-type phases. The mechanically alloyed powders were consolidated at temperatures ensuring maintaining amorphous structure and at 1000 degrees C. After consolidation at 1000 degrees C the samples consisted of nanocrystalline tau(2)-type phases and Al5Fe2 phase. The hardness of the amorphous and nanocrystalline Al60Fe20Ti20 alloy is 8.04 GPa and 9.37 GPa respectively, whereas that of the amorphous and nanocrystalline Al65Fe18Ti12Ni5 alloy is 7.69 GPa and 8.79 GPa respectively. The density of the amorphous and nanocrystalline Al60Fe20Ti20 alloy is 4.113 g/cm(3) and 4.20 g/cm(3) respectively, while that of the amorphous and nanocrystalline Al65Fe18Ti12Ni5 alloy is 4.111 g/cm(3) and 4.278 g/cm(3) respectively. The hardness of the produced low-density materials is relatively high. To the best of our knowledge, such materials were produced for the first time. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments were conducted to extract strain distributions in Ni-30W (wt%) alloy processed by Spark Plasma Sintering and loaded in tension. The alloy was designed for a strength-ductility tradeoff. It has a microstructure made of multi-crystalline W clusters embedded in Ni(W) solid solution matrix. Lattice strain analysis made it possible to separate the respective behavior of the two phases. Indeed, stress (590 MPa) and strain thresholds (2%) at which cracks initiate and propagate inside the W were detected. Further hardening observed between 2% and 10% is attributable to the Ni(W) solid solution. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nano-Bi@Super P composites were successfully synthesized using a wet-solid-wet method. EDTA-Bi was adsorbed evenly onto the surfaces of Super P particles and was then calcined into nano-sized Bi and Bi2O3; the nano-Bi@Super P composites were obtained by reducing Bi2O3 with NaBH4. The structure and morphology of the composites were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). One benefit of this composite was that the hydrogen evolution reaction of the zinc paste electrode was restrained. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, commercial dicyandiamide was used as the pyrolysis precursor of carbon nanotubes. Co (NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O and FeCl3 as non-precious metal precursors were mixed with dicyandiamide to in situ synthesize nitrogenated carbon nanotubes encapsulating Fe and Co nanoparticles via calcination under nitrogen atmosphere. The ratio of different metal species and thus the structure and properties of the final products were investigated in detail. As a result, the Fe0.4Co0.6-NCNTs exhibited optimal catalytic ammonia borane(AB) dyhydrogenation activity with the responding activation energy (Ea) calculated to be 19.89 KJ mol(-1), and the TOF value calculated based on metals was 102 mol(H2) min(-1) mol(cat)(-1), superior to most well-developed bimetal-based catalysts reported previously.

AB A novel aluminium-basalt metal matrix composite has been produced by employing a combination of stir mixing and ultrasonication processing techniques. A study of the matrix-fibre interface has revealed the formation of Al-Si-Ca and Al-Fe-Si-Mn intermetallic compounds (IMC) with both phases displaying a polyhedral morphology. The new composite exhibited a tensile strength of 189 MPa, resulting in a 13% improvement over the monolithic Al alloy. A 22% increase in yield strength and a 33% increase in wear resistance were also achieved, although the flexural and elastic moduli remained unchanged. It is proposed that these IMCs assist in load transfer from the matrix to the fibres. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID MICROWAVE-ABSORPTION; DESIGN
AB An ultra-broadband electromagnetic (EM) absorber composed of composite metamaterials was designed, fabricated and characterized. Polylactic-acid/reduced graphene oxide (PLA/RGO) composites with different amounts of RGO were prepared as a primary material collection. To provide good impedance matching and efficient wave attenuation, the multilayer absorbers were designed with a gradient index (GRIN) of characteristic impedance by manipulating the RGO content and the geometric parameters of the unit cell. The absorbers with different numbers of layers were fabricated by a material extrusion process, and then the reflection loss (RL) of the prepared samples was measured. Results showed that the methodology for designing a metamaterial absorber with gradient impedance and fabricating through a 3D printing process was effective in producing ultra-broadband absorbers. The seven-layer absorber achieved an absorption above 90% in a broad bandwidth of 4.5-40 GHz. This work could provide inspiration for upgrading the performance of some conventional absorbing composites through a rational design of the composite proportion and structure. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB To solve the phenomenon of electromagnetic wave radiation and interference, the high-performance microwave absorption materials with strong absorption and wide bandwidth are studied increasingly. Herein, a novel microwave absorption material of graphite nanosheets/core-shell Fe3O4@ppy hybrids (GNFP) is fabricated by facile processes. Fe3O4 nanospheres as chemical template start in the polymerization of pyrrole monomer to form the core-shell Fe3O4@ppy (FP) further placed on the surface of the treated graphite nanosheets (GNS) by 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (KH-550). The maximum reflectivity of GNFP hybrids is -49.3 dB at 9.92 GHz, and the bandwidth below -10 dB is 4.08 GHz (12.47-16.55 GHz) with layer thickness of 1.5 mm, which is due to great impedance matching, synergistic effect and multiple reflections. Thus, GNFP composites could be considered as a promising microwave absorber. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Magnetic and transport properties of iron nitride compounds are closely related to the ratio of Fe:N. In this letter, we report a successful growth of pure single-phase N-rich iron nitride (epsilon-Fe2-3N and gamma ''-FeN) films on Al2O3. epsilon-Fe2-3N shows a ferromagnetic behavior while gamma ''-FeN shows a nonmagnetic behavior. Same with other N-poor iron nitrides, epsilon-Fe2-3N presents metallic transport nature. In particular, weak localization in quantum interference effects (QIEs) and spin-dependent scattering phenomena are observed in epsilon-Fe2-3N. Different with other known iron nitrides, gamma ''-FeN shows semiconductor-like transport property. These findings offer great opportunities for designing magnetoelectronic devices based on iron nitride compounds. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Octacalcium phosphate (OCP) blocks are attractive as bone substitutes because of their excellent biocompatibility. They can be fabricated from precursor ceramic blocks via a compositional conversion process. Herein, high-purity OCP blocks were fabricated through a dissolution-precipitation reaction from precursor blocks of dicalcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) immersed in a 1.00-mol/L basic phosphate solution of disodium hydrogen phosphate (NaAP; pH similar to 9) at 70 degrees C for 2 days. The results showed that they were completely converted to OCP blocks comprising interlocking ribbon-like crystals while maintaining their shape. The diametral tensile strength of the obtained OCP blocks was similar to 6 MPa, which was significantly higher than that of OCP blocks fabricated from calcium sulfate as the precursor.

ID FE-GA
AB The internal friction (IF) method combined with high resolution XRD was used to systematically study the correlation between thermal history and high-temperature order-disorder phase transition in Fe-18Ga alloy. In the first and second heating processes, results show that the IF peak (P-tr) position related to order-disorder phase transition is independent of thermal history, but thermal history has a significant effect on the peak height. With the number of thermal cycles increasing, the peak height of P-tr become more pronounced. Combined with high resolution XRD results, the mechanism of this phenomenon is mainly due to the fact that more D0(3) phase is formed as the number of cycles increases. Furthermore, the elimination of internal dislocation in the Fe-18Ga alloy will also contribute to the formation of the P-tr peak. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB rGO/SiO2 composite coating was successfully prepared by plasma electrolyte oxidation (PEO) process on monocrystalline silicon (mc-Si) substrate. Investigating the effect of rGO incorporation into the SiO2 coating revealed that the addition of rGO leads to a significant increase in the photo-trapping ability due to the high specific surface area and excellent electron transfer efficiency. The PL intensity of the composite sample was found to decrease, which signified the suspension of the electron-hole pairs' recombination. As a result, the photocurrent gain of the composite coating enhanced about 5.5 times. Likewise, the time-response switching featured an over two-fold increase for the rGO/SiO2 coating, impressively.

Herein, a MoS2/Co-MOF nanocomposite assembled from MoS2 and 2D Co-MOF have been prepared through weak interactions. The optimized nanocomposite exhibits enhanced HER activity, including the lower overpotential (262 mV) and the smaller Tafel slope (51 mV.dec(-1)), which is attributed to the increased electrochemically active surface area, nanointerface engineering, and the synergistic effect between Co-MOF and MoS2.

AB In this paper, we report a method that the transition element nickel is doped into the interstitial position of CdZnS (CZS) nanoparticles for their photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity boosting. It is demonstrated that CdZnNiS nanocrystalline materials (with 0.5 wt% of Ni) could achieve the highest photocatalytic H-2-evolution activity of 25.4 mmol.g(-1).h(-1) in sulfide and sulfite solution under visible light which value is 1.16 times higher than that of Pt modified CdZnS particles (with 3 wt% of Pt). This work evidences the possibility of substitution of noble metal cocatalyst by adding a suitable inexpensive Ni to achieve high-efficient visible light driven water splitting hydrogen production.

AB While exhibiting favourable photoelectric properties, I/Cl mix halide (CH3NH3PbIxCl(3-x)) perovskite absorbers are usually deficient (or even devoid) in Cl according to many characterizations including XRD and EDS. Herein, a Vapor Transfer Method (VTM), providing an isolated reaction environment to reduce the potential loss of Cl, was applied to fabricate both CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbIxCl(3-x) perovskite solar cells to figure out how Cl exist in CH3NH3PbIxCl(3-x). Perovskite films with smooth surfaces with good surface coverage were obtained, and the existence of Cl and CH3NH3PbI3/CH3NH3PbCl3 mixed crystals were verified in CH3NH3PbIxCl(3-x) films. We also found that CH3NH3PbIxCl(3-x) films have better surface coverage, better size uniformity and higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.92%. This research provided an approach linked the existence of Cl and the performance of CH3NH3PbIxCl(3-x) absorber films together. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The oxygen nonstoichiometry, local states of iron cations, thermomechanical behavior, total electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient and specific oxygen permeability of perovskite-like La0.5Ca0.5FeO3-delta ceramics were studied as function of the oxygen partial pressure, temperature and time. The p-type electronic conductivity and oxygen permeation both exhibit a slow and irreversible degradation on thermal and redox cycling, as for the long-term isothermal tests. These changes correlate with decreasing oxygen content measured by coulometric titration and thermogravimetry, and with the volume contraction demonstrated by the controlled-atmosphere dilatometry. The Mossbauer spectroscopy results indicate that the degradation is associated with progressive ordering processes. The reductive decomposition into LaFeO3-based perovskite solid solution and Ca2LaFe3O8 +/-delta phases occurs via the formation of oxygen vacancy-ordered La0.5Ca0.5FeO2.75, where the ratio between octahedrally- and tetrahedrally-coordinated Fe3+ states is approximately 3:1. Under oxidizing conditions, microdomain texture comprising the ordered and disordered phases is formed at temperatures above 1023-1073 K. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The MnNiGe1-xCex (x = 0.05, 0.10 and 0.15) melt-spun ribbon flakes were obtained using a melt spinner system in a high purity Argon environment. The crystal structure of the samples was measured by room temperature XRD and in situ synchrotron XRD. The magnetic properties were investigated by PPMS. The results indicated after introducing Ce, the magnetic phase transition (AFM/FM) and structural phase transition (hexagonal/orthorhombic) happened simultaneously in MnNiGe1-xCex, resulted in an enhanced entropy change over the pure phase transition (PM/FM) in MnNiGe. This research showed that partial substitution of Ge with Ce can effectively decrease the Curie temperature of the hexagonal phase and increase the entropy change. This paper proposed an effective way to tune the magneto-structural phase transition temperature. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In order to overcome the shortcomings of ZnO-based anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, the electrode is designed as a nanostructure of interconnected nickel nanowall-supported ZnO film. The introduction of Ni increases the consumption of Li2O during the first charge process due to the conversion reaction between Ni and Li2O, and thus increases the initial coulombic efficiency. Interconnected Ni nanowalls work as a three-dimensional skeleton to enhance the strength of the film and the mechanical/electrical contact with the substrate, and thus improve the cycling and rate performance. The electrochemical performance of this ZnO/Ni composite is enhanced compared to pure ZnO and many other ZnO-based anode materials, confirming that the electrode structure design is effective.

AB Microorganisms have the ability to settle on nearly all man-made surfaces in contact with seawater and subsequently to form biofilm. Biofilms control and removal is necessary in the sectors of maritime transport, energy... In this work, we present the development of new pure calcium, zinc or copper alginate, but also mixed Ca/Cu and Ca/Zn alginate hydrogels. These materials have been evaluated for their potential inhibition of adhesion of two key biofilm-forming microalgae Halamphora coffeaeformis and Cylindrotheca closterium). All the tested materials have presented high adhesion inhibition about 80%). Copper-base materials present a high toxicity against H. coffeaeformis. Pure zinc alginate is also toxic for this strain. However, the addition of calcium in zinc alginate leads to the toxicity reduction. The toxicity of these materials differs according to the strains. Consequently, mixed zinc/calcium alginate are efficient at inhibiting microalgal adhesion with a low level of cells toxicity. These alginate hydrogels are promising materials because they are efficient, cheap, easy to develop and eco-friendly. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hierarchical multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) anchored manganese dioxide (MnO2) hybrid electrocatalyst have been prepared employing a simple solution route. The crystal structure and the morphology of products were investigated using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy (IR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The electrocatalytic behavior for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was evaluated using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) experiments. The hierarchical MWCNT wrap over MnO2 creating 3D network structures which has significant impact on the performance of oxygen reduction reaction. The onset potentials of MnO2 and MnO2/MWCNT are found to be -0.24 and -0.29 V respectively, indicating the good ORR activity of MnO2/MWCNT in alkaline medium. The number of electrons involved in the ORR is obtained 3.98 for MnO2/MWCNT and 2.91 for hollow sphere MnO2. Moreover MnO2/MWCNT composite shows better ORR selectivity in presence of methanol than that of bench mark Pt/C electrocatalyst. This enhanced electro catalytic behavior is mainly attributed to the synergism araised between the MnO2 and MWCNT. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results show that the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the composites for Pb removal was as high as 120.45-142.67 mg/g at pH 5 and 25 degrees C, and the adsorption kinetics can be described by pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Freundlich isotherm model. The composites preserved a crystal structure of hydrocerussite (Pb-rich phase) after adsorption. Pb2+ was attracted intensely by the functionalities from alginate-chitosan and then immobilized crystallization between OH center dot from geopolymer and dissolved CO2 from the air.

AB A facile method using melamine foam (MF) as the framework was firstly developed to construct Fe3O4 coated multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)- polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as efficient electroFenton (EF) cathode (Fe@PTFE/MWCNT-MF). Effect of PTFE on the yield of H2O2 was comparatively investigated. Using the 0.3% of PTFE modified electrode had the highest H2O2 yield (130 mg L-1) within 60 min. The analysis of contact angle and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) showed that the optimum electrode exhibited superhydrophobicity (137 degrees) and higher current response for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Compared to the traditional homogeneous EF system, the composite cathode exhibited excellent activation of H2O2 to generate center dot OH. The removal rates of methylene blue (MB) and total organic carbon (TOC) reached 100% and 78.4%, respectively. A possible degradation mechanism was also proposed. The Fe@PTFE/MWCNT-MF was an attractive candidate as EF cathode for oxidation removal of organic matters. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Silicone rubber (SR)/polyolefin elastomer (POE) blends containing 1-vinyl-3-ethylimidazolium bromide ionic liquids (ILs) modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were prepared by melt-blending and hot pressing. SR8/POE2-MILs (MWCNTs modified by ILs) composites show sea-island structure. The viscosity and volume fraction of POE-MILs localized in the POE domains could induce phase inversion and form co-continuous structure in SR6/POE4-MILs composites. The dielectric permittivity and loss of the composites increased significantly with increasing MILs content because space charge carriers aggregated at the interface between MILs and polymer and formed interfacial polarization. The SR8/POE2-MILs composites possess high dielectric permittivity and low loss because MILs distributed in the dispersed phase POE can inhibit conductive loss and ionic polarization.

XPS results revealed that Ni2+ sensitization increased the relative content of chemisorbed oxygen and oxygen vacancies on the surface of a-ZTO microcubes. Compared to pure a-ZTO microcubes, 0.75 at% Ni2+ sensitized a-ZTO microcubes can significantly improve the gas sensing performance to formaldehyde at 200 degrees C, which may be attributed to its uniform morphology and modification of Ni2+ on the surface of a-ZTO microcubes. Further, the gas sensing mechanism is briefly discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Retrieving desired information from databases containing video, natural scene, and license plate images through keyword spotting is a big challenge to expert systems due to different complexities that occur because of background and foreground variations of texts in real-time environments. To reduce background complexity of input images, we introduce a new model based on fractional means that considers neighboring information of pixels to widen the gap between text and background. To do so, the process obtains text candidates with the help of k-means clustering. The proposed approach explores the combination of Radon and Fourier coefficients to define context features based on regular patterns given by coefficient distributions for foreground and background of text candidates. This process eliminates non text candidates regardless of different font types and sizes, colors, orientations and scripts, and results in representatives of texts. The proposed approach then exploits the fact that text pixels share almost the same values to restore missing text components using Canny edge image by proposing a new idea of minimum cost path based ring growing, and then outputs keywords. Furthermore, the proposed approach extracts the same above-mentioned features locally and globally for spotting words from images. Experimental results on different benchmark databases, namely, ICDAR 2013, ICDAR 2015, YVT, NUS video data, ICDAR 2013, ICDAR 2015, SVT, MSRA, UCSC, Medialab and Uninusubria license plate data show that the proposed method is effective and useful compared to the existing methods.

ID INITIALIZATION; OUTLIER; SEARCH
AB The k-means algorithm is a widely used method that starts with an initial partitioning of the data and then iteratively converges towards the local solution by reducing the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE). It is known to suffer from the cluster center initialization problem and the iterative step simply (re-)labels the data points based on the initial partition. Most improvements to k-means proposed in the literature focus on the initialization step alone but make no attempt to guide the iterative convergence by exploiting statistical information from the data. Using higher order statistics (such as paths from random walks in a graph) and the duality in the data (as in co-clustering), for instance, are known ways to improve the clustering results. What is unique and significant in our proposed approach is that we embed these concepts into the k-means algorithm rather than just using them as an external distance measure and present a unified framework called the k-means based co-clustering (kCC) Algorithm. The initialization step has been modified to include multiple points to represent each cluster center such that points within a cluster are close together but are far from points representing other clusters. Moreover, neighborhood walk statistics is proposed as a semantic similarity technique for both cluster assignment and center re estimation in the iterative process. The effectiveness of the combined approach is evaluated on several standard data sets. Our results show that kCC performs better as compared to the baseline k-means and other state-of-the-art improvements. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Maintaining a good balance between the convergence and the diversity is particularly crucial for the performance of the evolutionary algorithms (EAs). However, the traditional multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, which have shown their competitive performance with a variety of practical problems involving two or three objectives, face significant challenges in case of problems with more than three objectives, namely many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs). This paper proposes a dynamic convergence diversity guided evolutionary algorithm, namely (DCDG-EA) for MaOPs by employing the decomposition technique. Besides, the objective space of MaOPs is divided into K subspaces by a set of uniformly distributed reference vectors. Each subspace has its own subpopulation and evolves in parallel with the other subspaces. In DCDG-EA, the balance between the convergence and the diversity is achieved through the convergence-diversity based operator selection (CDOS) strategy and convergence-diversity based individual selection (CDIS) strategy. In CDOS, for each operator of the set of operators, a selection probability is assigned which is related to its convergence and diversity capabilities. Based on the attributed selection probabilities, an appropriate operator is selected to generate the offsprings. Furthermore, CDIS is used which allows to greatly overcome the inefficiency of the Pareto dominance approaches. It updates each subpopulation by using two independent distance measures that represent the convergence and the control diversity, respectively. The experimental results on DTLZ and WFG benchmark problems with up to 15 objectives show that our algorithm is highly competitive comparing with the four state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms in terms of convergence and diversity.

AB In knowledge discovery studies, association rules mining has been extensively studied to discover hidden knowledge and relationships among set of items in a transactional dataset. Most research on association rule mining focuses on discovering frequent patterns based on the most frequent items occurring in the dataset. However, the process of extracting rare rules has received less attention. In medical dataset studies, the discovery of rare association rules (RARs) is more challenging, because it could likely be used to obtain more potentially rare and unusual knowledge for physicians, beside frequent association rules. Hence, the aim of this paper is to discover non-frequent or rare-unusual association rules (RUARs) from a stroke medical dataset to provide potential meaningful knowledge to the user domain.
   A discretization method needs to be performed as the data preprocessing step before generating rules. To the best of our knowledge, fewer studies have focused on the role of discretization results to support the extraction of a better amount and quality of RUARs, particularly for medical datasets. In addition, the extracted RUARs is expected to provide potential new unusual insights on stroke risk patterns. This paper applies mutual information measure to discretize a stroke examination dataset collected from a medical center in Taiwan. The interval merging method was proposed to simplify the discrete form and enrich the quality of generated rules. Towards the end, rare association rules, with relatively low support, were generated by employing the Apriori-Rare method accordingly. In addition, a filtering process was applied to the content of the rule itemsets to discover the expected set of RUARs for physicians. Furthermore, the extracted RUARs was analyzed based on the relative risk values toward the occurrence of stroke.
   Results indicated that the mutual information discretization outperformed the traditional discretization methods in terms of how the discretization scheme can support the extraction of RUARs with a better quantity and quality measurements for further analysis purpose in medical point of view. Moreover, the proposed method had a relatively higher number of RUARs. The knowledge of unusual rule patterns from rare association rules might provide potential new and unusual insights for medical pratitioners and increase the awareness of stroke examination results.

AB Prominent applications of sentiment analysis are countless, covering areas such as marketing, customer service and communication. The conventional bag-of-words approach for measuring sentiment merely counts term frequencies; however, it neglects the position of the terms within the discourse. As a remedy, we develop a discourse-aware method that builds upon the discourse structure of documents. For this purpose, we utilize rhetorical structure theory to label (sub-)clauses according to their hierarchical relationships and then assign polarity scores to individual leaves. To learn from the resulting rhetorical structure, we propose a tensor-based, tree-structured deep neural network (named Discourse-LSTM) in order to process the complete discourse tree. The underlying tensors infer the salient passages of narrative materials. In addition, we suggest two algorithms for data augmentation (node reordering and artificial leaf insertion) that increase our training set and reduce overfitting. Our benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our approach. Moreover, our tensor structure reveals the salient text passages and thereby provides explanatory insights. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Improving lexical coverage of text simplification systems for Spanish
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DT Article
DE Automated text simplification; Lexical coverage; External resources
AB The current bottleneck of all data-driven lexical simplification (LS) systems is scarcity and small size of parallel corpora (original sentences and their manually simplified versions) used for training. This is especially pronounced for languages other than English. We address this problem, taking Spanish as an example of such a language, by building new simplification-specific datasets of synonyms and paraphrases using freely available resources. We test their usefulness in the LS task by adding them, in various combinations, to the existing text simplification (TS) training dataset in a phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) approach. Our best systems significantly outperform the state-of-the-art LS systems for Spanish, by the number of transformations performed and the grammaticality, simplicity and meaning preservation of the output sentences. The results of a detailed manual analysis show that some of the newly built TS resources, although they have a good lexical coverage and lead to a high number of transformations, often change the original meaning and do not generate simpler output when used in this PBSMT setup. The good combinations of these additional resources with the TS training dataset and a good choice of language model, in contrast, improve the lexical coverage and produce sentences which are grammatical, simpler than the original, and preserve the original meaning well.

AB Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is an established medical technique used for describing water diffusion in an organic tissue. Typically, rank-2 or 2nd-order tensors quantify this diffusion. From this quantification, it is possible to calculate relevant scalar measures (i.e. fractional anisotropy) employed in the clinical diagnosis of neurological diseases. Nonetheless, 2nd-order tensors fail to represent complex tissue structures like crossing fibers. To overcome this limitation, several researchers proposed a diffusion representation with higher order tensors (HOT), specifically 4th and 6th orders. However, the current acquisition protocols of dMRI data allow images with a spatial resolution between 1 mm(3) and 2 mm(3), and this voxel size is much bigger than tissue structures. Therefore, several clinical procedures derived from dMRI may be inaccurate. Concerning this, interpolation has been used to enhance the resolution of dMRI in a tensorial space. Most interpolation methods are valid only for rank-2 tensors and a generalization for HOT data is missing. In this work, we propose a probabilistic framework for performing HOT data interpolation. In particular, we introduce two novel probabilistic models based on the Tucker and the canonical decompositions. We call our approaches: Tucker decomposition process (TDP) and canonical decomposition process (CDP). We test the TDP and CDP in rank-2, 4 and 6 HOT fields. For rank-2 tensors, we compare against direct interpolation, log-Euclidean approach, and Generalized Wishart processes. For rank-4 and 6 tensors, we compare against direct interpolation and raw dMRI interpolation. Results obtained show that TDP and CDP interpolate accurately the HOT fields in terms of Frobenius distance, anisotropy measurements, and fiber tracts. Besides, CDP and TDP can be generalized to any rank. Also, the proposed framework keeps the mandatory constraint of positive definite tensors, and preserves morphological properties such as fractional anisotropy (FA), generalized anisotropy (GA) and tractography.

AB Objective: In this study we propose a fuzzy classifier whose rule antecedents are determined based on the new approach to Clustering with Pairs of Prototypes (CPP). After demonstrating the high generalization ability of the classifier for six various benchmark datasets, a particular emphasis was placed on the application to support fetal state assessment based on the classification of cardiotocographic (CTG) signals.
   Methods: The CPP is a solution aimed at increasing the performance of fuzzy classifiers by introducing additional prototypes to those obtained using a given basal clustering method. The CPP improvement was achieved by applying the Fuzzy Clustering with epsilon-Hyperballs (FC epsilon eH) as basal clustering, as well as a new ant algorithm -based method of searching for pairs of prototypes.
   Results: The results were compared with three reference methods: the Lagrangian SVM with the Gaussian kernel function, and the same fuzzy classifier, but using the antecedents determined with the fuzzy c-means and the fuzzy (c + p)-means clustering. In case of five out of six benchmark datasets as well as for the CTG signals classification problem we achieved the highest generalization ability measured with the classification accuracy (benchmark data) and the classification quality index defined as geometric mean of sensitivity and specificity (CTG signals).
   Conclusions: The results of the numerical experiments showed high accuracy of the CPP-based fuzzy classifier when assessing various types of data. Moreover, the two-step classification of the CTG signals based on the proposed method allows for the efficient signal evaluation aiming to support the automated fetal state assessment.
   Significance and main impact: The most significant feature of the proposed method is the high generalization ability being the result of the epsilon-insensitive learning (FC epsilon H clustering), while maintaining the possibility of interpreting the learning outcomes thanks to the linguistic representation of the knowledge in the form of fuzzy conditional (if -then) rules. Therefore, we believe that this solution will have a positive impact on other studies on intelligent systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the big data area, a large number of variables are observed at mixed frequencies. How to explore the potential nonlinear pattern hidden in raw mixed frequency data without information loss is a challenging work. To this end, we develop a simple artificial neural network (ANN) model for mixed frequency data through introducing a mixed data sampling (MIDAS) or unrestricted MIDAS (U-MIDAS) approach into the ANNs framework, and construct the ANN-(U-)MIDAS model. It enables us to use raw mixed frequency data as inputs directly, and does not involve latent processes for preprocessing the data before feeding them into the neural network. Based on the backpropagation and chain rule, we derive the gradient vector and provide a solution procedure with the standard gradient based nonlinear optimization algorithm. We conduct extensive Monte Carlo simulations and a real-world application to illustrate the efficacy of the ANN-(U-)MIDAS, and then compare its decent performance with those of other competing models in terms of goodness-of-fit and predictive ability. The numerical results show that the hybrid ANN-(U )MIDAS model is an efficient tool to handle nonlinear mixed frequency data and has a broad application prospect in the field of expert and intelligent systems.

AB In this study, we develop a new Approximate Dantzig-Wolfe (ADW) decomposition method for variational inequalities (VI) based on the work by Chung and Fuller (2010) and Celebi and Fuller (2013). The decomposed VI consists of one approximate subproblem, which is nonlinear programming (NLP) or linear programming (LP) and one approximate master problem, which is an NLP. Note that we can have many approximate subproblems depending upon the approximation method and the structure of the constraint set. On the other hand, if the VI mapping in the approximate master problem is equal to that in the iterative methods for solving VI, then the ADW-VI simply consists of the computational sequence of solving NLP (or LP) subproblem(s) and NLP master problem in an iterative manner. That is, the iterative methods for VI and the DW decomposition method are combined into a single iterative loop. The details of the method are presented as well as an extension of the theory from Chung and Fuller (2010) and Celebi and Fuller (2013). In addition, numerical results are provided based on two time-of-use pricing models of Ontario electricity market in Celebi and Fuller (2013), but for which the new master problem approximation different from Celebi and Fuller (2013) has been used. These results validate ADW-VI, and in some computational instances, indicates dramatic improvements in solution times as compared to reference methods, like diagonalization method of Dafermos (1983). Another set of numerical results, based on a simple electricity market, illustrates that ADW-VI can be faster than the PATH solver when solving large-scale problem instances. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recommender systems (RSs) aim to help users to find relevant information based on their preferences instead of searching through extensive volume of information using search engines. Accurate prediction of unknown ratings is one of the key challenges in the analysis of RSs. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a well-known recommendation method that estimates missing ratings by employing a set of similar users to the target user. An outstanding topic in CF is picking out an appropriate set of users and using them in the rating prediction process. In this paper, a novel CF method is proposed to predict missing ratings accurately. The proposed method called TCFACO uses trust statements as a rich side information with Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) method. TCFACO consists of three main steps. In the first step, users are ranked considering available rating values and social trust relationships. Then, in the second step, the ACO method is utilized to assign proper weight values to users to show how they are similar to the target user. A set of top similar users is filter out in the third step to be used in predicting unknown ratings for the target user. In other words, to speed up identifying similar users, the proposed method first filters out a majority part of dissimilar users and then runs the ACO on only a reduced set of users to weight them. Several experiments were performed on three real-world datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the results show that the proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Intelligent traffic signaling is an important part of city road traffic management systems. In many countries, it is done through supervised/semi-supervised ways. With the advances in computer vision and machine learning, it is now possible to develop expert systems guided intelligent traffic signaling systems that are unsupervised in nature. In order to schedule traffic signals, it is essential to learn the traffic characterization parameters such as the number of vehicles, their arrival and departure rates, etc. In this work, we use unsupervised machine learning with the help of a modified Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM) to measure the aforementioned traffic parameters. This has been done using a new feature, named temporal clusters or tracklets extracted using DPMM. Detailed analysis on tracklet behavior during signal on/off period has been carried out to derive a queuing theory-based method for signal duration prediction. The queuing behavior at a junction is analyzed using tracklets for understanding their applicability. Queue clearance time at the junction has been used for predicting the signal duration with the help of Gaussian regression of historical data.
   Two publicly available video datasets, namely QMUL and MIT have been used for verification of the hypothesis. The mean absolute error (MAE) of the proposed method using tracklets has been reduced by a factor of 2.4 and 6.3 when compared with the tracks generated using Kernel Correlation Filters (KCF) and Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT), respectively. Through experiments, we are also able to establish that KCF and KLT tracks do not consider spatial occupancy of the vehicles on roads, leading to error in the estimation. The results reveal that the proposed queuing theory-based approach predicts the signal duration for the next cycle more accurately as compared to the ground truths. The method can be used for building intelligent traffic control systems for roadway junctions in cities and highways. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Identity recognition using local features extracted from ear images has recently attracted a great deal of attention in the intelligent biometric systems community. The rich and reliable information of the human ear and its stable structure over a long period of time present ear recognition technology as an appealing choice for identifying individuals and verifying their identities. This paper considers the ear recognition problem using local binary patterns (LBP) features. Where, the LBP-like features characterize the spatial structure of the image texture based on the assumption that this texture has a pattern and its strength (amplitude)-two locally complementary aspects. Their high discriminative power, invariance to monotonic gray-scale changes and computational efficiency properties make the LBP-like features suitable for the ear recognition problem. Thus, the performance of several recent LBP variants introduced in the literature as feature extraction techniques is investigated to determine how can they be best utilized for ear recognition. To this end, we carry out a comprehensive comparative study on the identification and verification scenarios separately. Besides, a new variant of the traditional LBP operator named averaged local binary patterns (ALBP) is proposed and its ability in representing texture of ear images is compared with the other LBP variants. The ear identification and verification experiments are extensively conducted on five publicly available constrained and unconstrained benchmark ear datasets stressing various imaging conditions; namely IIT Delhi (I), IIT Delhi (II), AMI, WPUT and AWE. The obtained results for both identification and verification indicate that the current LBP texture descriptors are successful feature extraction candidates for ear recognition systems in the case of constrained imaging conditions and can achieve recognition rates reaching up to 99%; while, their performance faces difficulties when the level of distortions increases. Moreover, it is noted that the tested LBP variants achieve almost close performance on ear recognition. Thus, further studies on other applications are needed to verify this close performance. We believe that the presented study has significant insights and can benefit researchers in choosing between LBP variants as well as acting as a connection between previous studies and future work in utilizing LBP-like features in ear recognition systems.

AB Due to the problems presented in current traditional/biometric security systems, the interest to use new security systems, have been increasing. This paper explores the use of brain signals EEG-based during imagined speech in order to use it as a new biometric measure for Subjects identification and thus create a new biometric security system. The main contribution of this paper are two methods for feature extraction, first to improve the signal-to-noise ratio the Common Average Reference was applied. The first method was based on Discrete Wavelet Transform, and the second method was based on statistical features directly from the raw signal. The proposed methods were tested in a dataset of 27 Subjects who performed 33 repetitions of 5 imagined words in Spanish. The results show the feasibility of the task with accurate identification of the Subject, regardless of the imagined word used and using a commercial EEG system (EMOTIV EPOC). In addition, the scope of the method is displayed by decreasing the training data, as well as the number of active sensors for the identification task. Using the proposed method with future improvements and implementing it in a low-cost device can be a new and valuable biometric security system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Finding relevant and interesting items on e-commerce websites is a major challenge in the information era. Recommender systems are widely used to help users deal with the information overload problem by giving them personalized recommendations. Furthermore, they help businesses make more profits. Collaborative filtering represents one of the most successful recommendation approaches. In general, several existing recommendation methods have demonstrated good performance in terms of prediction quality. However, they may require prohibitive computational times, and they often confront the sparsity problem, which negatively affects the efficiency of the system.
   In this paper, we propose a fast recommendation algorithm based on self-adaptation and multi-thresholding. It is designed to deal with the mentioned drawbacks, and improve the prediction quality. In addition, it is able to converge automatically. Extensive experiments on two real-world data sets demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve significantly better performance than other state-of-the-art methods. Particularly, it improves the MAE between 1.02% and 12.93%, and the computational time between 25.38% and 54.83%. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Currently, the influence of a single statistical cluster algorithm on the results of clustering procedures represents a major threat to the objectivity in clustering. To exemplify this question, this paper refers to country clustering in cross-cultural research. In this field, previous research has determined differing numbers of clusters, depending on choices available for the clustering procedure, leading to a high number of inconsistent results. Hence, it is argued that the variety in cluster solutions induced by the choice of different statistical cluster algorithms should be reduced. To this end, this study builds on Multi-Algorithm Voting (MAV) procedure introduced by Bittmann and Gelbard (2007) and presents an advancement to the MAV method. Specifically, MAV procedure is refined for the analysis of larger data sets using the simulated annealing algorithm for optimization. The use of this Optimized MAV (OMAV) is then demonstrated for country clustering in cross-cultural research. Specifically, a set of 57 countries is divided into 12 clusters based on work-related values obtained from GLOBE database reported in House et al. (2004). Thus, results clearly show that the objectivity of clustering results can be significantly improved based on OMAV. Implications for expert and intelligent systems on the use of OMAV are discussed. Namely, OMAV represents a powerful tool supporting the decision-making process in cluster analysis reducing the number of subjective and arbitrary decisions. Taken together, this study contributes to existing literature by providing an integrative and robust method of country clustering using OMAV and by presenting country clusters applicable to various settings.

AB Agile team formation is an important requirement of software companies. Since the members of an agile team should be generalizing specialists (i.e. T-shaped experts), we need members who are specialist in a specific topic and have general knowledge in other topics of the team. Selecting such members results in an ideal team which is flexible, high-performing and low-cost. In this paper, we define the problem of agile team formation in which given a set of required skills of an agile team, the ideal output is a set of low-cost candidates who can collectively cover the required skills while they can effectively communicate with each other. We propose two retrieval models to address this problem and then we introduce three evaluation measures for assessment. These measures are coverage, communication and optimality. Our experiments on two test collections extracted from StackOverflow demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed models in comparison with several strong baselines. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Malware creators have been getting their way for too long now. String-based similarity measures can leverage ground truth in a scalable way and can operate at a level of abstraction that is difficult to combat from the code level. At the string level, information theory and, specifically, entropy play an important role related to detecting patterns altered by concealment strategies, such as polymorphism or encryption. Controlling the entropy levels in different parts of a disk resident executable allows an analyst to detect malware or a black hat to evade the detection. This paper shows these two perspectives into two scalable entropy-based tools: EnTS and EEE. EnTS, the detection tool, shows the effectiveness of detecting entropy patterns, achieving 100% precision with 82% accuracy. It outperforms VirusTotal for accuracy on combined Kaggle and VirusShare malware. EEE, the evasion tool, shows the effectiveness of entropy as a concealment strategy, attacking binary-based state of the art detectors. It learns their detection patterns in up to 8 generations of its search process, and increments their false negative rate from range 0-9%, up to the range 90-98.7%. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have recently gained a huge users' attention on the Web. They are considered as a highly promising form of teaching from leading universities such as Stanford and Berkeley. However, users confront the problem of choosing among thousands of offered MOOCs. In such a scenario of severe "information overload", recommender systems can be very useful to recommend the right course to a user, since they base their operation on past user's log history. For example, Coursera recommends courses to users so that, they can acquire those skills, that are expected from their ideal job. These user's preferences are not expected to be independent from others choices, as users follow trends of similar behaviour. In this paper, we propose, xSVD++, where the "x" means that it is a multi-dimensional Matrix Factorization (MMF) model combined with Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithm, which exploits information from external resources (i.e., users' skills, courses' characteristics, etc.) to predict course trends and to perform rating predictions according to them. Our experimental results indicate that xSVD++ is superior over classic and non-negative matrix factorization algorithms and the state-of-the-art CMF, and SVD++ algorithms.

AB The increasing volume of user-generated content on the web has made sentiment analysis an important tool for the extraction of information about the human emotional state. A current research focus for sentiment analysis is the improvement of granularity at aspect level, representing two distinct aims: aspect extraction and sentiment classification of product reviews and sentiment classification of target-dependent tweets. Deep learning approaches have emerged as a prospect for achieving these aims with their ability to capture both syntactic and semantic features of text without requirements for high-level feature engineering, as is the case in earlier methods. In this article, we aim to provide a comparative review of deep learning for aspect-based sentiment analysis to place different approaches in context. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Data mining continues to play an important role in medicine; specifically, for the development of diagnosis aid models used in expert and intelligent systems. Although we can find abundant research on this topic, clinicians remain reluctant to use decision support tools. Social pressure explains partly this lukewarm position, but concerns about reliability and credibility are also put forward. To address this reticence, we emphasize the importance of the collaboration between both data miners and clinicians. This survey lays the foundation for such an interaction, by focusing on the specifics of diagnosis aid, and the related data modeling goals. On this regard, we propose an overview on the requirements expected by the clinicians, who are both the experts and the final users. Indeed, we believe that the interaction with clinicians should take place from the very first steps of the process and throughout the development of the predictive models, thus not only at the final validation stage. Actually, against a current research approach quite blindly driven by data, we advocate the need for a new expert-aware approach. This survey paper provides guidelines to contribute to the design of daily helpful diagnosis aid systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The recognition of coral species based on underwater texture images poses a significant difficulty for machine learning algorithms, due to the three following challenges embedded in the nature of this data: (1) datasets do not include information about the global structure of the coral; (2) several species of coral have very similar characteristics; and (3) defining the spatial borders between classes is difficult as many corals tend to appear together in groups. For this reasons, the classification of coral species has always required an aid from a domain expert. The objective of this paper is to develop an accurate classification model for coral texture images. Current datasets contain a large number of imbalanced classes, while the images are subject to inter-class variation. We have focused on the current small datasets and analyzed (1) several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, (2) data augmentation techniques and (3) transfer learning approaches. We have achieved the state-of-the art accuracies using different variations of ResNet on the two small coral texture datasets, EILAT and RSMAS. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID LINK PREDICTION; KNOWLEDGE
AB Networks have become increasingly important to model many complex systems. This powerful representation has been employed in different tasks of artificial intelligence including machine learning, expert and intelligent systems. Link prediction, a branch of network pattern recognition, is the most fundamental and essential problem for complex network analysis. However, most existing link-prediction methods only consider a network's topology structures, and in doing so, these methods miss the opportunity to use nodes' attribute information. We present a combined approach here that uses nodes' attribute information and topology structure to direct link prediction. First, we propose a discriminative feature combinations selection method. Specifically, we present a novel mathematics inference to detail discriminative feature combinations. Second, based on the selected feature combinations, we aggregate the network, and further compute each feature combination's contributing degree to the link's formation, called the strength of feature combination. Third, we apply discriminative feature combinations into a local random walk model; in particular, we compute and redistribute the random walk particle's transfer probability in terms of each feature combination's strength, which makes the transfer probability depend on feature combinations satisfied by each node's edges. Finally, we predict links in complex networks based on the improved random walk model. Experimental results on real-life complex network datasets demonstrate that, compared to other baseline methods, using discriminative feature combinations and topology structures in tandem strengthens prediction performance remarkably.

AB In this article is introduced an improved version of Fast Fuzzy C-Means (FFCM) by using the Crow Search optimization Algorithm (CSA) for the task of data clustering. In the proposed version of the FFCM the CSA is employed to find the centroids of the clusters that provide more accurate results in the clustering process. In this sense, the CSA avoids that the FFCM get stuck in local minima and increases the computational performance. The main feature of the CSA is its ability to find the global solution in complex optimization problems with the calibration of a reduced amount of parameter. This fact reduces the sensibility in the iterative process and permits the FFCM use the best centroids. To verify the efficiency of the proposed FFCM in a real problem, it is applied for the identification of maize plants in images from crop fields. The process starts using the adaptive colour histogram equalization to enhance the contrast and adjusts the intensities of crop images. The next task consists in to obtain the green index that is used by the CSA to compute the centroids for the FFCM algorithm. To evaluate the performance of the presented approach, it has been tested over a set of images from maize fields with different degrees of complexity, captured by different cameras and with a different perspective of the scene. Different metrics and a statistical analysis evidence that the proposed algorithm obtains better segmentation results in comparison with other methods. The experimental results proved that the proposed approach is capable of finding the optimal centroid values of the FFCM and avoids the local optima problem. Moreover, the FFCM based on CSA method can locate crop rows with the maximum accuracy as possible in digital images. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A PCA based sequence-to-vector (seq2vec) dimension reduction method for the text classification problem, called the tree-structured multi-stage principal component analysis (TMPCA) is presented in this paper. Theoretical analysis and applicability of TMPCA are demonstrated as an extension to our previous work (Su, Huang, & Kuo, 2018b). Unlike conventional word-to-vector embedding methods, the TMPCA method conducts dimension reduction at the sequence level without labeled training data. Furthermore, it can preserve the sequential structure of input sequences. We show that TMPCA is computationally efficient and able to facilitate sequence-based text classification tasks by preserving strong mutual information between its input and output mathematically. It is also demonstrated by experimental results that a dense (fully connected) network trained on the TMPCA preprocessed data achieves better performance than state-of-the-art fastText and other neural-network-based solutions.

AB In this paper, we explore the use of reference values (predictors) for the optimal objective function value of hard combinatorial optimization problems, instead of bounds, obtained by data mining techniques, and that may be used to assess the quality of heuristic solutions for the problem. With this purpose, we resort to the rectangular two-dimensional strip-packing problem (2D-SPP), which can be found in many industrial contexts. Mostly this problem is solved by heuristic methods, which provide good solutions. However, heuristic approaches do not guarantee optimality, and lower bounds are generally used to give information on the solution quality, in particular, the area lower bound. But this bound has a severe accuracy problem. Therefore, we propose a data mining-based framework capable of assessing the quality of heuristic solutions for the 2D-SPP. A regression model was fitted by comparing the strip height solutions obtained with the bottom-left-fill heuristic and 19 predictors provided by problem characteristics. Random forest was selected as the data mining technique with the best level of generalisation for the problem, and 30,000 problem instances were generated to represent different 2D-SPP variations found in real-world applications. Height predictions for new problem instances can be found in the regression model fitted. In the computational experimentation, we demonstrate that the data mining-based framework proposed is consistent, opening the doors for its application to finding predictions for other combinatorial optimisation problems, in particular, other cutting and packing problems. However, how to use a reference value instead of a bound, has still a large room for discussion and innovative ideas. Some directions for the use of reference values as a stopping criterion in search algorithms are also provided. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates whether a particular magnitude and direction of inter-regional return signal transmission dominates the performance of domestic trading in American, European and Australasian stock markets. A trading system design, based on fuzzy logic rules, combines direct and indirect channels of foreign information transmission, modelled by stochastic parameter regressions, with domestic momentum information to generate stock market trading signals. Filters that control for magnitude and direction of trading signals are then used to investigate incremental impact on economic performance of the proposed investment system. The results indicate that at reasonable levels of transaction costs very profitable trades that are fewer in number do not increase investment performance as much as trades based on foreign information of a specific low-to-medium daily return magnitude of 0.5% to 0.75%. These information based strategies are profitable on risk-adjusted bases and relative to a market, but performance declines considerably when tradable instruments are used. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Deep learning is widely used in medical applications regarding the high performance it can achieve. In this paper, we propose a segmentation recommender based on crowdsourcing and transfer learning for skin lesion extraction. In fact, after collecting and pre-processing data from the ISIC2017 segmentation challenge, we tested two pre-trained architectures (VGG16 and ResNet50) to extract features from the convolutional parts. Then, a classifier with an output layer, composed of five nodes representing the segmentation methods' classes, was built. Thus, the proposed architecture is able to dynamically predict the most appropriate segmentation technique for the detection of skin lesions in any input image. Experimental results prove the capability of the proposed image-based method to improve the segmentation performance comparatively to the state of the art methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Lots of researches try to predict the stock price movement using financial news based on machine learning represented by SVM (Support Vector Machine). But almost all of them focus on the news contents while very few consider the information hiding in the relationship between different news. In this paper, we proposed a new kernel based on SVM concerning not only the contents themselves but also the information structures among them. As both the news contents and the information structures are imported into our kernel, this kernel is named as semantic and structural kernel, referred to S&S kernel. Medical industry financial news is used to illustrate the efficiency of our kernel. By comparing the predicting accuracy of S&S kernel with other kernels, such as linear kernel, we find our method outperforms the others by at least 5% on accuracy, which is a quite meaningful promotion. The result also confirms the information structure contained in daily financial news can offer extra information helping to predict the trend of stock price. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In recent years, several studies have harnessed Twitter data for detecting traffic incidents and monitoring traffic conditions. Researchers have utilized the bag-of-words representation for converting tweets into numerical feature vectors. However, the bag-of-words not only ignores the order of tweet's words but suffers from the curse of dimensionality and sparsity. A common approach in literature for dimensionality reduction is to build the bag-of-words on the top of pre-defined traffic keywords. The immediate criticisms to such a strategy are that the pre-defined set of keywords may not include all traffic keywords and the tweet language is subjected to change over time. To address these shortcomings, we utilize the power of deep-learning architectures for both representing tweets in numerical vectors and classifying them into three categories: 1) non-traffic, 2) traffic incident, and 3) traffic information and condition. First, we map tweets into low-dimensional vector space through word-embedding tools, which are also capable of measuring the semantic relationship between words. Supervised deep-learning algorithms including convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) are then deployed on the top of word-embedding models for detecting traffic events. For training and testing our proposed model, a large volume of traffic tweets is collected through Twitter API endpoints and labeled through an efficient strategy. Experimental results on our labeled dataset show that the proposed approach achieves clear improvements over state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aircraft sequencing problem (ASP) is an NP-Hard problem. It involves allocation of aircraft to runways for landing and takeoff, minimising total tardiness. ASP has made significant progress in recent years. However, within practical time limits, existing incomplete algorithms still either find low quality solutions or struggle with large problems. One key reason behind this is the typical way of using generic heuristics or metaheuristics that usually lack problem specific structural knowledge. As a result, existing such methods use either an exhaustive or a random neighbourhood generation strategy. So their search guidance comes only from the evaluation function that is used mainly after the neighbourhood generation. In this work, we aim to advance ASP search by better exploiting the problem specific structural knowledge. We use the constraint and the objective functions to obtain such problem specific knowledge and we exploit such knowledge both in a constructive search method and in a local search method. Our motivation comes from the constraint optimisation paradigm in artificial intelligence, where instead of random decisions, constraint-guided more informed optimisation decisions are of particular interest. We run our experiments on a range of standard benchmark problem instances that include instances from real airports and instances crafted using real airport parameters, and contain scenarios involving multiple runways and both landing and takeoff operations. We show that our proposed algorithms significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art aircraft sequencing algorithms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In real world, the best choice may not be the maximum or the minimum but between them, such as the befitting temperature for plants to grow, the suitable pH value for the human health, etc. Meanwhile, since the decision makers' evaluations may be different and none of them can be ignored, the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy sets were proposed to help the decision makers express their opinions in a simple and comprehensive way. Therefore, the traditional multi-attribute decision making methods cannot deal with this situation and a series of new decision-making methods based on probabilistic hesitant fuzzy sets are developed in this paper. Firstly, we investigate the relationships between the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy elements and the reference ideal values, and propose two distance measures which take all the possible situations into consideration. Then, by combining the reference ideal method and the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy sets, we develop three different decision-making methods to process the reference ideal multi-attribute decision making problem. Then, we apply these methods in the water conservancy project evaluation problem to verify the operability of the methods. We also conduct a comparison analysis to study the reasonability and the stability of these methods. Based on the comparison results, we find that the methods have their own advantages and disadvantages, and different methods are suitable for different decision-making environments and demands. These proposed methods extend the reference ideal methods to the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy environments and provide new angles of decision making in the research field of expert and intelligent systems.

AB This paper describes a method for solving vehicle routing problems with time windows, based on selecting meta-heuristics via meta-learning. Although several meta-heuristics already exist that can obtain good overall results on some vehicle routing problem instances, none of them performs well in all cases. By defining a set of meta-features that appropriately characterize different routing problem instances and using a suitable classifier, our model can often correctly predict the best meta-heuristic for each instance. The main contributions of this paper are the definition of two meta-feature sets, one based on what we call 'basic' instance properties and another based on the number of feasible solutions found by perturbative heuristics via a greedy process. We use a multilayer perceptron classifier, combined with a wrapper meta-feature selection method, to predict the most suitable meta-heuristic to apply to a given problem instance. Our experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve upon the overall performance of well-known meta-heuristics in the field. Therefore, this paper proposes to store, share and exploit in an off-line scheme the solutions obtained in instances of different scenarios such as the academy or industry, with the aim of predicting good solvers for new instances when necessary.

AB With the busy life of modern people, more and more consumers are preferring to shop online. This change on shopping behavior results in large volumes of packages must be transported, and thus research on logistics planning considering real constraints has increased. To solve this problem, several heuristics or evolutionary methods with expert knowledge were proposed previously, but they are usually inefficient or need a large amount of memory. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach called Iterative Logistics Solution Planner (ILSP) for not only quickly finding a nice logistics solution but also iteratively improving the solution quality while meeting the real logistics constraints. ILSP contains two main phases including initial logistics solution generation and iterative logistics solution improvement based on the intelligence and knowledge from domain experts. Several algorithms and strategies are designed in ILSP for package partitioning, route planning and quality improvement. From the view of expert systems, the significance and impact of ILSP are simultaneously taking both computational efficiency and iterative quality improvement based on the expert knowledge into account on logistics planning problem with pickup and delivery. Through the rigorous experimental evaluations of real logistics data, the results demonstrated the excellent performance of ILSP. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Activities of daily living (ADL) or activities of daily working (ADW) may be affected by changes in a person's health or well-being. Measuring progressive changes in one activity or multiple activities is representative of behavioural variations. By inspecting the trends in multiple activities, it is possible to identify and predict human behavioural changes. We refer to the trends in people's behaviour as behavioural evolution. In this paper, we propose a novel indicator to measure the progressive changes representing a participant's behavioural evolution. The proposed indicator presents activities as a holistic measure, which first combine multi-activities and then measure the progressive changes in the combined activities for each single day.
   Real data sets were collected from a wireless sensor network and used to examine our proposed technique. As part of this process, we were able to quantify progressive changes for individual and aggregated activities. Our experimental results demonstrated that: (1) the proposed approach can identify and distinguish normal and abnormal behaviours; (2) large data sets gathered from sensors in an intelligent environment represented in various time series can be visualised in a simple and more understandable format; (3) identifying trends in ADLs or ADWs is a relevant means of sharing information with carers or supervisors.

AB In modern education systems, plenty of research suggests that clustering the learners into optimal learning groups based on their multiple characteristics is a determining effort in enhancing the effectiveness of collaborative learning. Although there have been several evidences on developing and implementing appropriate computational tools to handle classification processes in expert and intelligent systems, the effectiveness and accuracy of optimal grouping algorithms are still worth improving. For instance, the majority of grouping processes in collaborative learning environments is orchestrated through single objective optimization algorithms, which need to be revisited due to some intrinsic limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm capable of properly addressing a variety of optimization problems in optimal learning group formation processes. To this end, a multi-objective version of Genetic Algorithms, i.e. Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm, NSGA-II, was successfully implemented and applied to improve the performance and accuracy of optimally formed learning groups. In contrast to the previous related works applying single-objective algorithms, the main advantage of our work is simultaneous satisfaction of multiple targets predefined for the formation of optimal learning groups, especially the inter-homogeneity and intra-heterogeneity of each learning group, which significantly enhance both effectiveness and accuracy of optimal grouping processes in the underlying intelligent systems. Challenging the proposed optimization algorithms, both single- and multi-objective optimizers, with a similar grouping problem, clearly proved that the single-objective optimization technique has limited control and sensitivity to the quality of individual groups. Contrary to single-objective optimization techniques, which are mainly governed by adjusting the quality of the groups altogether in average, the proposed multi-objective algorithm not only takes the average desirability of all formed groups into account but also precisely monitors the fitness of each group in a potential solution distinctively. The generality of the proposed algorithm makes it a suitable candidate not only to handle optimal grouping in learning environments but also to be competent enough for grouping problems in other domains as well.

AB Twitter has become instrumental as a means of spreading information, opinions or awareness about real world events. The classification of event-related tweets is a challenging problem since tweets are noisy and sparse pieces of text that lack contextual information. Related work proposes contextual enrichment techniques using external sources (e.g. semantic web, external documents), often considering underlying assumptions about the target events. However, they lack guidelines for determining the textual features to enrich, the external sources to use, the properties to explore, and how to prevent the inclusion of unrelated information. In this paper, we propose a hybrid semantic enrichment framework for the classification of event-related tweets. We contribute to this field by leveraging different contextual enrichment strategies into a unifying framework targeted at a broad range of event types, where each enrichment technique has a role in the improvement of event classification. The framework also encompasses a solution to deal with the huge number of features that result from semantic enrichment, which combines a pruning method to select domain relevant semantic features and general-purpose feature selection techniques. We assessed the contribution of each framework component to event classification improvement using a broad experimental setting. Using seven events of distinct natures, we outperformed a word embeddings baseline in 93.6% of cases, and a textual baseline in 60.3% of cases. In most cases, we improved the recall, with no significant impact on the precision. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Automated segmentation of tumor epithelial tissue from histological images is a fundamental aspiration of digital pathology to improve biomarker assessment and tissue diagnosis. Accurate tumour segmentation is an important step in many automated digital image analysis applications to be used in clinical practice. In particular, segmentation of tumour, non-tumour epithelium and stromal tissue compartments on immunohistochemistry images presents a challenge. Many artifacts, such as staining and/or illumination variations, can confound image analysis. In this paper, we propose a cascade-learning approach which can diminish the impact of these artifacts. It consists of (a) a set of novel invariant features that encodes meaningful information about the appearance and shape of the region of interest and (b) a novel level set formulation where contour evolution is driven by a probabilistic model of the appearance of the region (based on fuzzy c-means). The merit of our approach is that it exploits both appearance and shape information and combines them in the tissue classification framework. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the segmentation of tumour epithelium in colorectal cancer. The experimental results show that our approach is robust to staining differences, additive noise, intensity inhomogeneities, and can cope with a limited number of training samples, when compared to the state-of-the-art tumour epithelial segmentation methods.

AB Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer among women. With increased emphasis towards cancer related research, many data-driven research works have been conducted for classifying cancer diagnosis, survival, or recurrence. Unlike existing literature, this study aims to discover interesting subgroup patterns of long-term and short-term survival from the breast cancer incidence data of the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) Program. We present a rule induction method for subgroup discovery, which can effectively find subgroup patterns by focusing on local exceptionality detection in contrast to global models. The significance of subgroup patterns discovered is examined with statistical tests. Furthermore the characteristics of two exceptional high and low survival groups are compared by examining the descriptive statistics of prognostic factors in each group. The case study's results show that the proposed subgroup mining and statistical test approach is a promising technique for clinical and medical data analytics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

DE Answer selection; User modelling; Attentive neural network
AB In this paper, we propose solutions to advance answer selection in Community Question Answering (CQA). Automatically selecting correct answers can significantly improve intelligence for CQA, as users are not required to browse the large quantity of texts and select the right answers manually. Also, automatic answers selection can minimize the time for satisfying users seeking the correct answers and maximize user engagement with the site. Unlike previous works, we propose a hybrid attention mechanism to model question-answer pairs. Specifically, for each word, we calculate the intra-sentence attention indicating its local importance and the inter-sentence attention implying its importance to the counterpart sentence. The inter-sentence attention is based on the interactions between question-answer pairs, and the combination of these two attention mechanisms enables us to align the most informative parts in question-answer pairs for sentence matching. Additionally, we exploit user information for answer selection due to the fact that users are more likely to provide correct answers in their areas of expertise. We model users from their written answers to alleviate data sparsity problem, and then learn user representations according to the informative parts in sentences that are useful for question-answer matching task. This mean of modelling users can bridge the semantic gap between different users, as similar users may have the same way of wording their answers. The representations of users, questions and answers are learnt in an end-to-end neural network in a mean that best explains the interrelation between question answer pairs. We validate the proposed model on a public dataset, and demonstrate its advantages over the baselines with thorough experiments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI APL: Adversarial Pairwise Learning for Recommender Systems

   Recommender systems
AB The main objective of recommender systems is to help users select their desired items, where a major challenge is modeling users' preferences based on their historical feedback (e.g., clicks, purchases or check-ins). Recently, several recommendation models have utilized the adversarial technique, which has been successfully used to capture real data distributions in various domains (e.g., computer vision). Nevertheless, the training process of the original adversarial technique is very slow and unstable in the domain of recommender systems. First, the sparsity of the implicit feedback dataset aggravates the inherently intractable adversarial training process. Second, since the original adversarial model is designed for differentiable values (e.g., images), the discrete items also increase the training difficulty. To cope with these issues, we propose a novel method named Adversarial Pairwise Learning (APL), which unifies generative and discriminative models via adversarial learning. Specifically, based on the weaker assumption that the user prefers observed items over generated items, APL exploits pairwise ranking to accelerate the convergence and enhance the stability of adversarial learning. Additionally, a differentiable procedure is adopted to replace the discrete item sampling to optimize APL via backpropagation and stabilize the training process. Extensive experiments under multiple recommendation scenarios demonstrate APL's effectiveness, fast convergence and stability. Our implementation of APL is available at: https://github.com/ZhongchuanSun/APL. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As an extension to statistical techniques, fuzzy regression analysis estimates the relationship between fuzzy independent variables and non-fuzzy and/or fuzzy dependent variables. However, facing skewed or non-normal data may lead to vague results if the conventional least square models are used. However, there are many situations in applications of intelligence systems where regression components are fuzzy quantities instead of exact values. The present work is aimed to propose a fuzzy semi-parametric quantile regression model with fuzzy predictors, a fuzzy smooth function, exact coefficients and fuzzy responses. The proposed method is based on a new class of novel kernel-based signed-distance measures in space of fuzzy numbers. Main features of the proposed signed-distance including its robustness were studied. It was shown that the proposed signed-distance measure is more reasonable and effective than a common signed-distance which extensively has been used in fuzzy set theory. This is the reason why we decided to apply the proposed signed-distance to extend the classical quantile regression model. Then, a hybrid algorithm was suggested to evaluate optimal bandwidth, non-fuzzy regression coefficients and fuzzy smooth function at a specific quantile level. The proposed method was then compared with some common fuzzy regression models based on two data sets including a simulation study and an applied example. The numerical results clearly indicated that the proposed fuzzy semi-parametric quantile linear regression model performs better than the other available methods in terms of some common goodness of-fit criteria in cases where the data set includes skewness and/or some outlier data point. The main advantages of the proposed method are as follows: 1-it is not so sensitive to the outlier data points and/or skewed data, 2- it possesses better fitting effect compared to other existing fuzzy regression models. Thus, the proposed quantile regression model could be successfully applied in many practical studies of fuzzy regression model in real-world applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a fully automated brain tissue classification method for normal and abnormal tissues and its associated region from Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery modality of Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. The proposed regional classification method is able to simultaneously detect and segment tumours to pixel-level accuracy. The region-based features considered in this study are statistical, texton histograms, and fractal features. This is the first study to address the class imbalance problem at the regional level using Random Majority Down-sampling-Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (RMD-SMOTE). A comparison of benchmark supervised techniques including Support Vector Machine, AdaBoost and Random Forest (RF) classifiers is presented, where the RF-based regional classifier is selected in the proposed approach due to its better generalization performance. The robustness of the proposed method is evaluated on the standard publicly available BRATS 2012 dataset using five standard benchmark measures. We demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms three benchmark tumour classification methods in terms of Dice score and obtains significantly better results as compared to its SVM and AdaBoost counterparts in terms of precision and specificity at the 5% confidence interval. The promising results of the proposed method support its application for early detection and diagnosis of brain tumours in clinical settings. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Trajectory frequent pattern mining is an important branch of data mining. The constraint of indoor space is between Euclid space and road network space, which makes it difficult to represent the approximate positions. Grid partition method is a feasible way to solve this problem, but it will lead to a sharp problem of grid boundary. Considering the indoor trajectory frequent pattern mining, this paper proposes a grid partition method based on vertical projection distance (VGS) and a trajectory frequent pattern mining algorithm based on vague grid sequence (VGS-PrefixSpan). At first, each grid is divided into explicit zones and vague zones according to vertical projection distance. Then the trajectories are transformed into vague grid sequences. At last, VGS-PrefixSpan is a PrefixSpan-like algorithm to mine trajectory frequent patterns from vague grid sequences. Experimental results show that VGS-PrefixSpan has better performance than VSP-PrefixSpan under the same area ratio of explicit zones and covered zones, and has better mining results than VSP-PrefixSpan and GS-PrefixSpan under any value of MM _ Support. In terms of mining efficiency, the total time of VGS-PrefixSpan is close to GS-PrefixSpan and less than VSP-PrefixSpan about two orders of magnitude. Therefore, VGS-PrefixSpan is an effective and efficient algorithm in mining frequent patterns of indoor trajectories. As a research hotspot in Location Based Services (LBS), mining frequent patterns of indoor trajectories can protect the trajectory privacy of users from being leaked or mitigating the risk of leakage. Therefore, the study of trajectory frequent patterns is of great significance to public security and personal information protection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Clustering based unsupervised segmentation approaches have become important tools to model data and infer knowledge. Such approaches are often used in various biomedical applications to assist experts in analyzing the data. Segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images has become a very challenging task due to the presence of Rician noise and intensity inhomogeneity. The existing methods dealing with such issues work in the spatial domain. These methods are prone to losing image details while reducing the effect of noise. The proposed method works in the moment domain, and for this purpose, we have selected Zernike moments (ZMs). The ZMs are orthogonal, rotation invariant and robust to image noise. The proposed method is based on our previous work on Zernike moments-based unbiased nonlocal means (ZM-UNLM) approach for denoising MR images affected by the Rician noise. The ZM-UNLM-based approach uses both the local and nonlocal information while eliminating Rician noise from brain MR images which have fine image details along with the noise components. Keeping in view the superior performance of the ZM-UNLM, we extend it to segment brain MR images and propose a method called local ZMs(LZM)-based unbiased nonlocal means fuzzy C-means (LZM-UNLM-FCM) approach which provides much-improved segmentation accuracy as compared to the existing spatial domain-based state-of-the-art techniques. It is shown how the LZMs based technique reduces the effect of the Rician noise while retaining the fine structures, edges, and other image details in the moment domain. The complete framework consists of an intelligent knowledge-driven approach that segments tissues from brain MR images using both the local and nonlocal information in the moment domain. The proposed approach has significance in developing future expert and intelligent systems that do not require any human intervention to manually annotate data and saves time for diagnostic related tasks. Detailed experimental results are provided to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over the existing state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Edible berries are good sources of several phytochemicals. However, the native folate levels in berries are not well known. The structure of native folates contains polyglutamyl chains, which reportedly jeopardize the bioavailability of native folates; further gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH) can deglutamylate polyglutamyl chains. In this study we use a validated ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method to determine the distribution of polyglutamyl 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-CH3THF-Glun), folate vitamers, and total folates in different berries and to monitor changes in their concentration during processing of berries into juice. The pre-boiling treatment was optimized during extraction to stabilize the native polyglutamyl folates profile and facilitate folate extraction, which can replace the traditional di-enzyme treatment process. Additionally, the efficiency of commercially available human recombinant GGH was tested and it was found that a 10 mu g GGH/mL extract at a pH of 6 could completely deconjugate polyglutamyl folates into monoglutamyl folates when incubated for 30 min. Pure human recombinant GGH with a higher catalytic efficiency and stable enzymatic properties was better than traditional folate conjugase for this purpose. From experimental analysis, it could be inferred that strawberries and blackberries contained the highest amount of total folates (93-118 mu g/100 g), while the total folate contents in blueberries were the lowest. Most of the investigated berries are good to excellent folate sources. This study is the first time that 5-CH3THF-Glun and distribution of folate vitamers in various berries are quantitated. Further, this is the first study to show the application of recombinant pure GGH for the deconjugation of polyglutamyl folates for folate vitamers and total folates analysis.

AB The effects of turanose on the physicochemical properties of rice flour systems (aqueous suspension, dough, and noodles) were investigated in terms of rheology, microstructure, and water mobility. Inclusion of turanose increased the pasting viscosities of rice flour by maintaining a closely-packed structure at high temperatures that was confirmed by the real-time microscopic measurements during heating. The elevated probability of inter-granular interactions by turanose apparently raised both storage (G') and loss (G '') moduli of the rice flour pastes as well as their respective viscosities. NMR spin-spin relaxation times showed two distinct water populations in the turanose-rice flour samples. The Mixolab experiments demonstrated that the rice doughs with higher levels of turanose exhibited greater dough stability as well as higher degrees of starch gelatinization and retrogradation. Furthermore, the extruded rice noodles containing turanose exhibited a higher expansion ratio and a firmer texture that contributed to lowering the cooking loss by 24.5%.

AB Forty-five honey samples of three honey types - two monofloral (acacia and sunflower) and one polyfloral (meadow) were collected from the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina (Republic of Serbia) and analysed for their physicochemical parameters (moisture, acidity, pH, ash, electrical conductivity, glucose, fructose, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), CIE L*a*b* colour and mineral content). All tested physicochemical parameters were in agreement with the EU regulation except for moisture (4 samples) and HMF content (1 sample).
   Principal component analysis (PCA) was used for assessing the effects of three honey types on all investigated physicochemical parameters. According to PCA, acacia honey samples can be clearly isolated and form a cluster, while, regarding other honey types, PCA can offer the possibility to distinguish sunflower and meadow honey samples regarding examined physicochemical parameters and mineral content.

AB Nutritional quality of snacks prepared from cereals can be improved by the addition of crude lycopene (CL), tomato powder (TP) and saffron extracts (SE) which are known for their high photochemical content. The study was undertaken to prepare extruded snacks from whole wheat flour enriched with CL, TP and SE. Effect of extrusion on physicochemical, antioxidant and sensory properties of snacks was also investigated. Hardness of snacks containing CL and TP was higher than the control. Pasting properties of the formulations were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced upon addition of CL and TP. Total phenolic content (TPC) of the formulations with added TP increased significantly (p < 0.05). Antioxidant properties of snacks enhanced after enrichment. Extrusion significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the TPC, DPPH scavenging activity and pasting properties of snacks while, reducing power and inhibition of lipid peroxidation increased. Storage period lowered the hardness and antioxidant properties of snacks.

AB At red wine pH, malvidin-3-glucoside (mv-3-glc), the major anthocyanin of red wine, is expected to be present mainly in its non-colored hemiketal form. However, due to copigmentation with flavanols (e.g. epicatechin), the stabilization of the colored forms of mv-3-glc occurs. Some flavanols have been linked to astringency, due to their ability to interact/precipitate salivary proteins, namely proline-rich proteins (PRPs). So, a major question is if this copigmentation interaction could affect the ability of flavanols to interact with SP. To answer this, the effect of the interaction between mv-3-glc and epicatechin with basic and acidic PRPs, was investigated by saturation-tranfer difference (STD)-NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).
   The most relevant result was that epicatechin: mv-3-glc mixture presents a synergic effect toward the interaction with both PRPs when compared to individual polyphenols. Furthermore, was observed that epicatechin interaction was driven by hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions while mv-3-glc interaction was driven by electrostatic interactions.

AB In response to growing concerns about the consumption of artificial sweeteners, the demand for natural sweeteners has recently increased. Mogroside V is a common natural sweetener extracted from the fruit of Siraitia grosvenorii, but its taste should be improved for marketability. Here, we screened various microbes for the ability to perform selective hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in mogroside V, converting it to siamenoside I, which has a higher sweetening power and better taste than other mogrosides. Dekkera bruxellensis showed the most promising results in the screen, and the Exg1 gene (coding for a beta-glucosidase) of D. bruxellensis was cloned and purified. We then used HPLC-MS/MS to assess the beta-glucosidase activity of purified enzymes on p-nitrophenyl beta-glucoside and mogroside V. The results demonstrated that D. bruxellensis had a unique enzyme that can selectively hydrolyze mogrol glycosides and promote the conversion of the natural sweetener mogroside V to siamenoside I.

AB In this paper, we employed a direct analysis in real time (DART) ion source coupled to QTRAP mass spectrometry for the analysis of chloramphenicol (CAP) in honey. The accuracy of the DART-MS/MS method for the analysis of CAP in honey was evaluated by comparison with data generated by a validated HPLC-MS/MS method. The sample preparation procedure was optimized to obtain sensitive and accurate determination of trace CAP residue in honey at concentrations less than 1.0 mu g/kg. The DART-MS/MS method offers faster analysis time, lower cost per analysis, and reduced matrix effects and simplicity compared to HPLC-MS/MS method. Fifty-two honey samples collected from a Chinese market were analyzed using two methods. The results of the two methods are in good agreement, suggesting DART-MS/MS as a potential technique for the direct detection of trace amounts of veterinary drugs in complex matrixes.

AB We studied the changes in the phytochemicals profile of two instant corn flours produced by different process: traditional nixtamalization process (TN) and by ohmic heating process (OH). The highest total phenolics content was found in the OH flours (OHF), which showed predominance of bound phenolics and free flavonoids compared with the TN flours (TNF). Ferulic acid measured by HPLC-DAD was the most abundant compound in its bound form in the OHF, but decreased by 57% in TNF. The insoluble fiber content was preserved by the OHF (17.49%) and the soluble fiber increased similar to 65% compared with TNF. These data suggest that instant corn flours processed by OH preserves the phenolic profile and antioxidant profile similarly than flours processed by TN; furthermore, water waste was reduced significantly, and no effluents were produced in the ohmic heating process.

AB This study was designed to investigate the nature of modification of myofibrillar proteins by nitric oxide (NO) and the extent to which S-nitrosylation alters their susceptibility to calpain-1 proteolysis. Isolated myofibrils from porcine semimembranosus muscle were incubated with the NO donor S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) at 0, 20, 50, 250, 1000 mu M for 30 min at 37 degrees C and then incubated with purified calpain-1. GSNO treatment decreased the thiol content of myofibrillar proteins and increased their intensity and amount of S-nitrosylation. GSNO caused the formation of proteins cross-linkage through intermolecular disulfide. More desmin and titin (T2, the degraded fragment of original titin) were degraded by calpain-1 when myofibrils were incubated with 1000 mu M GSNO. Incubation with 250 and 1000 mu M GSNO suppressed calpain-1-catalyzed cleavage of troponin-T. The data suggest that NO could change the redox state of myofibrillar proteins and subsequently affect the extent of proteolysis by calpain-1 in a protein-dependent manner.

AB Calcium content in sparkling wines may not exceed 80 mg/L due to the risk of aggregation with alginate capsules. The high calcium content usually found in wine and must emphasizes the need to develop alternative and appropriate techniques faster and cleaner than atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). To obtain a robust model to predict calcium content, FT-NIR spectroscopy was used in 98 base white wine samples and 60 must samples from an Alentejo winery. The reference method for calcium determination was AAS technique, with a dry ashing sample procedure, as a prior treatment.
   Results confirmed the ability of FT-NIR as an alternative technique to AAS, to predict calcium content in grape must and base wine. Advance knowledge of the calcium content in the grape must will help avoid obtaining a mixture of musts with a high calcium content in the same container.

AB The influence of different dephytinisation methods such as malt flour addition, phytase enzyme application and citric acid addition on some properties of commercial bread and traditional flat bread containing 25% of cereal-legume (rye, barley, oat, chickpea, soy and lupin) flours was investigated. Ash, protein, crude fat, antioxidant activity, total phenolic content and mineral matters of both breads increased with the usage of cereal-legume flour blend. Cereal-legume flour blend also resulted in increments on phytic acid content of commercial bread (330 mg/100 g) and traditional flat bread (422 mg/100 g) compared to its controls (98 and 152 mg/100 g, respectively). Phytase enzyme application provided the highest loss of phytic acid for commercial bread (54%) and traditional flat bread (52%). Dephytinisation methods had no significant effect on weight, specific volume and hardness (24 h) of commercial bread containing 25% cereal-legume flour blend. Compared to other dephytinisation methods citric acid addition provided higher diameter, spread ratio and hardness (72 h) values in traditional flat bread. Taste and odour parameters of breads were not affected by the dephytinisation methods.

AB The present study evaluated the impact of phosphorus application rate on plant growth and physiological parameters, antioxidant activity, chemical composition, and essential oil yield and composition of hydroponically grown spearmint plants. Increased P levels resulted in high dry matter content of the aerial part. Antioxidant activity of spearmint leaves was significantly higher at the highest P levels. Although essential oil yield was not affected, essential oil composition varied among the studied P levels, especially carvone content. Total and individual organic acids content was higher when 50 mg/L P were added in the nutrient solution. Rosmarinic acid was the main detected phenolic compound, while the highest total phenolic compounds and rosmarinic acid content was observed at 50 and 70 mg/L of P, respectively. In conclusion, phosphorus application rate may affect spearmint growth and development, as well as chemical composition and essential oil composition.

AB L-Theanine is a specialized metabolite in tea (Camellia sinensis) leaves that contributes to tea function and quality. Yellow tea leaves (albino) generally have higher L-theanine contents than green tea leaves (normal), but the reason is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate why L-theanine is accumulated in yellow tea leaves. We compared original normal leaves (green) and light-sensitive albino leaves (yellow) of cv. Yinghong No. 9. The L-theanine content was significantly higher in yellow leaves than in green leaves (p <= 0.01). After supplementation with [H-2(5)]-L-theanine, yellow leaves catabolized less [H-2(5)]-L-theanine than green leaves (p <= 0.05). Furthermore, most plants contained the enzyme catalyzing L-theanine conversion to ethylamine and L-glutamic acid. In conclusion, L-theanine accumulation in albino-induced yellow tea leaves was due to weak L-theanine catabolism. The differential accumulation mechanism differed from the L-theanine accumulation mechanism in tea and other plants.

AB Curcumin is a phenolic compound produced by some plants, among which Curcuma longa is the reachest in this principal curcuminoid. Curcumin is known from its lability, however, the structural curcumin transformations and the formation of hydroxy and alkoxy adducts has not been reported yet. The formation of the mentioned derivatives is favoured by an alkaline environment. The presented results are important both from the analytical and food processing point of view as curcumin transformation products can be mistakenly treated as new components naturally present in turmeric, while in fact they may be formed during food products preparation, causing consumer misinformation about their bioactivity. In this context, an attempt has been made to investigate this problem. The present paper shows that curcumin easily transforms into ketonic/enolic structural isomers and forms adducts with water and alcohols. All structures of these compounds were confirmed by MSn, HRMS and partly also by NMR data.

AB The physical and oxidative stability of high-fat omega-3 delivery systems such as fish oil-in-water emulsions stabilized with combinations of sodium caseinate (CAS) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) was optimized. The influence of fish oil content (50, 60 and 70%, w/w), amount of total emulsifier CAS + PC (1.4, 2.1 and 2.8%, w/w) and ratio between CAS and PC (0.4, 1.2 and 2) on physical and oxidative parameters was investigated. Creaming and droplet size significantly decreased when the amount of fish oil, total emulsifier and ratio of CAS to PC were increased. Viscosity decreased significantly with decreasing fish oil content, whereas the ratio of CAS to PC did not have a significant influence. Decreasing the ratio of CAS to PC led to emulsions with a significantly lower concentration of 1-penten-3-ol, while no significant effect was found for other volatiles such as (E)-2-pentenal, (E)-2-hexenal and (E, E)-2,4-heptadienal.

AB This study determined influence of industrial scale milling and air classification on separation of pea flours into fine and coarse fractions. Three commercial field pea flours were chosen from field peas grown in Manitoba, Canada, - whole green pea flour (WGPF), split green pea flour (SGPF), and organic split yellow pea flour (OSYPF). The ranges of 85-87% protein, 74-95% fat, and 66-76% minerals were enriched in the pea fine fractions. A range of 78-91% starch was enriched in the coarse fractions. Scanning electron microscopy and proximate analysis confirmed compositional shift between the fine and coarse fractions. The particle size analysis demonstrated that the milling in this study was sufficient and effective in reducing the flour particle size to smaller than 22 mu m, which was considered to be the cut-point. The yield of the fine fraction was as high as 44% and acceptable for an industrial manufacture.

AB This study investigated the structural characteristics of oil bodies from mature coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) fruit. The ultrastructure and the distribution of oil bodies in coconut endosperm were investigated using cryo-scanning electron microscopy. The interfacial characteristics of the oil bodies in suspensions isolated using two different protocols were studied using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and the oleosins stabilizing the oil bodies were characterized using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis. The oil bodies were found to be preferentially accumulated in endosperm tissues away from the inner endosperm and had a poly-disperse size distribution, both intracellularly and in suspensions. The CLSM of oil bodies revealed uniform distribution of proteins and phospholipids at the interface along with glycolipids. Six different proteins were found to be associated with oil bodies some of which were disulfide-linked. This work provides new insights into the structure of coconut oil bodies and mechanisms for their stabilization.

AB Cinnamon bark is a very complex spices matrix for pesticide residue analysis. In this study, two cleanup procedures, dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE) and repetitive d-SPE, combined with Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) extraction were both investigated and applied for the determination of 60 pesticide residues in cinnamon bark by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) detection. The extraction solvents, phase partition salts, and cleanup sorbents were optimized. The results showed that 150 mg MgSO4 + 50 mg C-18 showed the best performance in d-SPE. The repetitive d-SPE achieved less matrix effects than d-SPE, but several high water-solubility analytes were lost during the cleanup, and also the 10 fold dilution compromised the sensitivities of analytes. With the validated QuEChERS-d-SPE method, 44 of 60 pesticides obtained satisfactory recoveries (71%-118%) and RSDs (2%-27%) at three to five spiking levels. The method was applied to monitor 15 market cinnamon samples.

AB The aim of this study was to ascertain the impact of atmospheric pressure plasma jet treatment (APPJ) as a function of treatment times (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 min) on the conformation and physicochemical properties of myofibrillar proteins (MPs) extracted from king prawn (Litopenaeus vannamei). The results showed that the pH and protein solubility were decreased after 10 min treatment of APPJ. These results were also confirmed by dynamic light scattering, which indicated an increase in mean particle diameter of MPs from 654 to 2297 nm. Complementary methodologies used to characterize the structural changes confirmed the exposure of hydrophobic groups and promotion of protein-protein interactions. These occurrences were particularly more intense at the longest treatment duration. The high energetic and oxidizing species contained in the plasma gas may have considerable implications on the physical and structural characteristics of MPs from king prawn.

AB A rapid, reliable, and quantitative method to determine acrylamide content in fried food based on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) by re-oxidized graphene oxide/Au nanoparticle composites and dispersive solid-phase extraction has been proposed. The peak at Delta v= 1478 cm(-1) was selected as the characteristic peak of acrylamide for quantitation. Sufficient linearity was obtained in the concentration range of 5-100 mu g.kg(-1) (R-2 = 0.983). The limits of detection and quantification in fried food were 2 and 5 mu g.kg(-1), respectively. The recovery rates for acrylamide were 73.4-92.8% with coefficients of variation less than 4.2%, and the long-term stability of the substrates was approximately 180 days at 4 degrees C. The results of detection using the proposed method were consistent with those obtained by LC-MS/MS, while the measurement time was reduced to 9.5 min per sample. The study also demonstrates that this method can potentially be used for acrylamide detection in the field.

AB This research investigated the effects of pulsed electric fields (PEF) (1.4-1.7 kV/cm, 653-695 kJ/kg) and heating (60 and 80 degrees C for 10 min) at different pH (4, 5, 7, and 9) on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of ovomucin-depleted egg white (OdEW) after in vitro gastrointestinal hydrolysis. PEF and heating (80 degrees C for 10 min) at pH 4 enhanced the antioxidant activity of the whole hydrolysates, chemically determined using DPPH and ORAC assays. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory activity of protein hydrolysates was assessed in lipopo-lysaccharide-stimulated HT-29 cells using ELISA assay. PEF and heating at pH 4 enhanced the anti-inflammatory activity of the whole hydrolysates dose-dependently. Hydrolysates at 1 mg/ml showed similar inhibition (35.5% and 35.9%) of interleukin-8 production, due to PEF treatment and heating (80 degrees C for 10 min), respectively. Results indicated that prior PEF treatment can analogously enhance both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of OdEW hydrolysates to heating, with potentially reduced thermal input.

AB Preconcentrations of Cu(II), Ni(II) and Pb(II) ions by using Coprinus silvaticus immobilized multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) were investigated. Effects of important parameters on preconcentration procedure were examined. The best pH values of for Cu(II), Ni(II) and Pb(II) were found to be 6.0, 6.0 and 4.0, respectively. Flow rate of sample solution was 2.0 mL min(-1), while desorption was achieved at 1.0 mL min(-1) flow rate. Preconcentration factors were achieved as 60 for Cu(II), Ni(II) and 70 for Pb(II) (by dividing initial sample volume to final volume). LODs were calculated as 0.014, 0.016 and 0.093 ng mL(-1), respectively for Cu(II), Ni(II) and Pb(II). Accuracy of the method was checked by applying to certified reference samples. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP OES) was employed for measurements of Cu(II), Ni(II) and Pb(II) in digested baby food samples.

AB Clove ( Syzygium aromaticum, L.) essential oil is known for its antimicrobial activity against several pathogenic bacteria. Encapsulation of clove oil was proposed as a mean to disguise its strong odor that limits its uses in food industry. Thus, the aim of this study was extraction, encapsulation and assessment of the antimicrobial and antioxidant potential of clove essential oil. The essential oil showed high DPPH scavenging capacity and low hydroxyl radical inhibition. Clove essential oil showed in vitro inhibitory and bactericidal effect against S. aureus, E. coli, L. monocytogenes and S. Typhimurium. In addition, in situ antimicrobial activity of clove oil against S. aureus was superior to nitrite. The essential oil particles encapsulated with sodium alginate and emulsifiers, showed high encapsulation efficiency, low antioxidant activity and strong antimicrobial inhibition. Similar bacterial growth was observed in meat-like products after addition of either particles or nitrite.

AB The effects of the carbonic maceration and conventional winemaking on the volatile composition and aromatic sensory characteristics of Tempranillo Blanco wines were studied for the first time, during three consecutive vintages. Relationships between instrumental (volatiles) and sensory variables were analyzed applying partial least squares regression (PLS). Carbonic macerated wines had higher contents of alcohols and carbonyl compounds, yet lower concentrations of C-6 alcohols and volatile acids than wines conventionally produced. The Odor Activity Values (OAV) exhibited an increase in wines when carbonic maceration was applied. According to the geometric mean (% GM) obtained from aroma descriptors the effect of the winemaking process was significant for seed fruit, ripe fruit and floral notes. When subjected to PLS the data from the instrumental analysis yielded a satisfactory model for the prediction of aroma descriptors in this set of wines.

AB We used an UPLC-MS/MS method to investigate the effects of smoking or baking on the formation of heterocyclic amines (HAs) in sausage processing. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to differentiate the chemical composition, pH and colour of the processed sausages. We detected and quantified eight types of HAs (PhIP, DMIP, Phe-P-1, IQ[4,5-b], 7,8-DiMeIQx, A alpha C, harman and norharman) in sausages, finding total HA concentrations as high as 422 +/- 17.5 ng/g. Higher smoking temperatures led to higher concentrations of total HA in smoked sausages (330 +/- 8.19 to 422 +/- 17.5 ng/g). On the contrary, higher baking temperatures created lower total HA concentrations in baked sausages (ranging from 139 +/- 9.83 to 306 +/- 0.92 ng/g). Our results demonstrated that HAs are produced even at low temperatures, which means that HAs should be controlled during sausage processing to minimise their formation.

AB A rapid and sensitive method was developed to determine 131 pesticides in tea by on-line gel permeation chromatography-gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometer (on-line GPC-GC-MS/MS) using graphitized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as dispersive solid phase extraction (DSPE) sorbent in sample pretreatment. Sample clean-up performance of various functionalized MWCNTs and their influences to recoveries were investigated. In the method validation, good linearity correlation coefficients (R2) were obtained, which were higher than 0.99 for all pesticides. The percent recoveries were 78.2%-113.9% at the spiked concentration levels of 20, 50 and 200 mu g/kg with relative standard deviations (RSDs, n=6) lower than 15.8%. Limits of detections (LODs) were in the range of 0.5-5.0 mu g/kg. This method is simple and fast with relatively high sensitivity and can achieve the requirements of pesticides analysis.

AB Water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions with a discontinuous aqueous phase dispersed in a continuous camellia oil phase were prepared by using tea polyphenol palmitate (Tp-palmitate) particle as effective stabilizers and their properties were characterized by droplet size, slip melting point (SMP), stability, microstructure and rheology. The d(4,3) and d(3,2) decreased from 7.96 mu m to 4.67 mu m and from 5.98 mu m to 3.07 mu m, respectively, and the SMP rose from 33.73 degrees C to 38.60 degrees C when the Tp-palmitate concentration increased from 1.0% to 2.5% (m/v). The storage stability, freeze/thaw stability and thermal stability significantly enhanced and the droplets aggregation progressively increased with the increasing of Tp-palmitate concentration. The liquid camellia oil was transformed into solid-like viscoelastic emulsion gels with a SMP of 38.6 degrees C when using 2.5% Tp-palmitate as particle stabilizers. This study provides a promising method for production of edible gel-like W/O emulsions using polyphenol-lipid complexes to potentially replace solid fats.

AB This study investigated the effect of UK dairy production system, month, and their interaction, on retail milk fatty acid (FA) profile throughout the year. Milk samples (n= 120) from four conventional (CON), four organic (ORG) and two free-range (FR) brands were collected monthly. ORG milk had more nutritionally-desirable polyunsaturated FA, including rumenic acid and the omega-3 PUFA alpha-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic and docosapentaenoic acids, and less of the nutritionally-undesirable palmitic acid. Milk FA profile was similar between FR and CON systems, but FR milk had less saturated FA (SFA) and/or palmitic acid, and/or greater alpha-linolenic and rumenic acids in certain months within the peak-grazing season. According to the measured milk FA profiles and UK milk fat intakes, milk and dairy products contribute around one-third of the maximum recommended SFA intake. A small increased intake of beneficial PUFA may be expected by consuming ORG milk but human health implications from such differences are unknown.

TI Ancient olive trees as a source of olive oils rich in phenolic compounds
SO FOOD CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Phenolic compounds; Health claims; Crop year; Olive heritage
ID QUALITY; IMPACT
AB Olive oil phenolic compounds are receiving increased attention due to its influence on sensory characteristics and to scientific evidences of positive health effects. In this work, 28 ancient olive trees were selected and, during four consecutive seasons (2014-2017), oils were extracted and their phenolic fraction characterized. Hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol secoiridoids were the predominant groups, with contents between 32 and 496 mg of tyrosol equivalents/kg. Based on principal component analysis it could be concluded that the individual phenolic contents enabled the unsupervised grouping of olive oils by crop year. Furthermore, linear discriminant analysis allowed achieving sensitivities greater than 90%. It was shown that some specimens consistently allowed obtaining oils with high phenolic contents (>= 500 mg tyrosol equivalents/kg). The identification of centenarian specimens for breeding based on their potential to produce oils with high levels of healthy compounds is of utmost interest, contributing to preserve the genetic heritage.

AB Pyranoanthocyanins are anthocyanin derivatives that are formed during fermentation and oxygenation processes in aged wine. They play a critical role in assessing the aging of wine based on its colour quality. Naturally, the formation process of pyranoanthocyanins is fairly slow. In this respect, the present work studies the role and efficiency of ultrasonic treatment in accelerating the formation of methylpyranocyanidin-3-O-glucoside and investigates the spectral characteristics as well as the stability of this derivative toward heat, bisulfite bleaching and pH variation in a simulation system. Our results showed that the yield of methylpyranocyanidin-3-O-glucoside can be increased by 32.5% by ultrasonic treatment at 100W for 40 min, and excessive treatment (>= 60 min) does not have a positive effect on the yield. Moreover, this derivative exhibits a better stability toward heat, pH variation and bisulfite bleaching than its precursor cyanidin-3-O-glucoside.

AB Mercury has the ability to bind to a variety of biomolecules, which can compromise its structure and functionality and thus promote its toxic effects. The aim of this study is to identify possible mercury biomarkers in muscle samples of Plagioscion squamosissimus (carnivorous fish) and Colossoma macropomum (omnivorous fish), from the Amazon region. The muscle proteome of fish species was separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), and the total mercury concentrations in protein spots were determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS). The protein spots containing mercury were characterized by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). The mercury concentrations in the protein spots were in the range of 1.10 +/- 0.02-23.90 +/- 0.33 mu g g(-1). The proteins phosphoglycerate mutase 2 (P. squamosissimus), hemoglobin beta and cytochrome P450scc (C. macropomum), identified by ESI-MS/MS and showing the highest values of mercury concentration, may be considered possible mercury biomarkers.

AB Zwitterionic dispersive magnetic solid phase extraction (ZI-DMSPE) was developed through in situ binding of glycine on the magnetic graphene oxide, electrostatically. This highly selective sorbent was applied for the determination and preconcentration of trace levels of nitrite in soil, sausage, water samples (tap, mineral, and rain), and vegetables (potato, onion, spinach, radish, and lettuce) prior to its determination by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The major advantage of the method is the analyte adsorption in both acidic and basic media. The sorbent was characterized by SEM, XRD, EDS, and FT-IR. Several parameters affecting ZI-DMSPE were optimized. Under the optimal conditions, LOD and RSD were obtained 17 ng L-1 and 1.3% respectively. Preconcentration factor and sorption capacity of the proposed method were 666 and 238 mg g(-1) respectively. Accuracy was assessed by comparing results with those obtained by direct determination using ion chromatography and spiked real samples.

AB Spinach leaves, goji berries and quinoa seeds are claimed to have a great nutraceutical potential due to their high content of compounds providing benefits for human health, such as amino acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, carotenoids, betaine, vitamins, fibre, minerals and polyphenols. Samples of these plants were extracted with different solvent mixtures (e.g. EtOH, H2O/EtOH 3:7 and H2O/EtOH 7:3) and extractions were accomplished using a microwave apparatus. Subsequent UHPLC analysis and photodiode array detection were employed for the quantification of biologically active compounds like 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin, auraptene, umbelliprenin, boropinic acid and 4'-geranyloxyferulic acid. EtOH was found to be the best solvent in terms of extractive yields and the above-mentioned phytochemicals were recorded in the concentration range 2.01-49.22 mu g/g dry extract. The findings depicted herein revealed that spinach, goji and quinoa are good sources of oxyprenylated umbelliferone and ferulic acid derivatives.

AB Milk glycoproteins are crucial nutrients with a variety of functions. However, whey N-glycoproteomes in human and bovine milks have not been characterized during lactation. Herein, using lectin enrichment and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, 68, 58, 100, and 98 N-glycoproteins were identified in human colostrum and mature milk as well as bovine colostrum and mature milk whey. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analyses were used to elucidate the biological functions of whey N-glycoproteins in human and bovine colostrum and mature milks. Whey N-glycoproteomes differed dramatically between human and bovine milks and across lactation stages. The conserved and specific whey N-glycoproteins in all four sample types were also determined. Our results improve understanding of the properties and biological functions of whey N-glycoproteins in human and bovine milk and colostra, and provide insight into the potential application of some N-glycoproteins in infant formulae at different stages of development.

AB Mycotoxins can contaminate poultry production via fungal infection of feeds. The impact of different cooking methods on mycotoxins stability and bioaccessibility is scarcely studied. Recent cooking practices such as the use of roasting bags along with some seasonings to cook chicken have become a trend to maintain the tenderness of the meat. This study evaluated the impact of oven roasting and microwaving of chicken breast muscles, with/without roasting bags and/or herbs addition on the stability and bioaccessibility of the 10 prevalent mycotoxins. Cooking itself reduced mycotoxins content, while using bags did not confer any advantage; adding herbs reduced mycotoxins content by up to 60%, but also appeared to increase their bioaccessibility. Thus, strategies to reduce their increased bioaccessibility should be the subject of future research. Notwithstanding, adding herbs prior to cooking could be used as a mitigation strategy to reduce mycotoxins in meat.

AB Annual ryegrass is one of the most serious, costly weeds of winter cropping systems in Australia. To determine whether its competition-mediated plant defence mechanisms effect on wheat grain quality, wheat (cv. Yitpi) and annual ryegrass were grown under two levels of CO2 (400 ppm; (a[CO2]) vs 700 ppm; (e[CO2]), two levels of water (well-watered vs drought) and two types of competition (wheat only; (W), and wheatxannual ryegrass; (W x R) with four replicates. The competitionx[CO2] interaction had a significant effect on wheat grain protein content, where it was increased in W x R under both e[CO2] (+ 17%) and a[CO2] (+ 21%). Grain yield, total grain reducing power and phenolic content were significantly affected by [CO2] x drought x competition. In a summary, annual ryegrass competition significantly altered the wheat grain quality under both [CO2] levels (depending on the soil water level), while also decreasing the grain yield.

AB Polyaniline/protoporphyrin nanocomposites were prepared via a simple chemical method in the acidic suspension of protoporphyrin. The scanning electron microscope images revealed that the polyaniline/protoporphyrin composites exhibited an interesting nanosheet structure decorated with nanoparticles, which is rather different with the usual nanofiber morphology of polyaniline. The formation of the nanosheet structure is because protoporphyrin molecules may exist as a bilayer form at low pH, which is similar with the phospholipid bilayer in membranes of cells. To demonstrate the application potential of the composites, the sensing performance of the composites was tested when exposed to four volatile organic compounds, including trimethylamine, triethylamine, ethanol, and ethyl acetate. The composites exhibited highest response value (S) of 39.482 toward trimethylamine, and fast response time of 2-4 s toward trimethylamine and triethylamine. The outstanding sensing performance showed that the prepared composites had great application potential in electronic noses system in further work.

AB Cobalamin degrades in the presence of light and heat, which causes spectral changes and loss of coenzyme activity. In the presence of beta-lactoglobulin or alpha-lactalbumin, the thermal-and photostabilities of adenosylcobalamin (ADCBL) and cyanocobalamin (CNCBL) are increased by 10-30%. Similarly, the stabilities of ADCBL and CNCBL are increased in the presence of whey proteins by 19.7% and 2.2%, respectively, when tested in gastric juice for 2 h. Due to the limited absorption of cobalamin during digestion, excess cobalamin can enter the colon and modulate the gut microbiome. In a colonic model in vitro, supplementation with cobalamin and whey enhanced the proportions of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes spp. and reduced those of Proteobacteria spp., which includes pathogens such as Escherichia and Shigella spp., and Pseudomonas spp. Thus, while complex formation could improve the stability and bioavailability of cobalamin, these complexes might also mediate gut microecology to influence human nutrition and health.

AB Soy protein isolate (SPI) and carrageenan (IC) complex coacervates were formed through electrostatic attractions for encapsulating Bifidobacterium longum. The effects of pH (2.0-5.0) and SPI:IC mass ratios (10:1, 15:1, 20:1) on coacervate yield, entrapment efficiency and viability of the probiotic bacteria were investigated. The coacervates produced at pH 3 had higher yields and entrapment efficiency, and a SPI:IC mass ratio of 10:1 produced a complex coacervate with more compact microstructure. Compared to the native ones, the bacteria encapsulated in the coacervates had significantly improved viability during storage (4 degrees C), pasteurization (85 degrees C for 5, 10 and 30 min) and in vitro dynamic gastric and intestinal digestion. The findings also suggested that the coacervate with a SPI:IC ratio of 10:1 was more capable to protect the bacteria from loss against different stresses. This study provides a novel approach for designing efficient microcapsules containing probiotic bacteria with enhanced functional properties.

AB The generation, accumulation and decay of free radicals in six varieties of cheese, irradiated (0-4 kGy) in an electron accelerator, have been studied by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. Remarkably, the ESR spectra of all untreated cheeses showed only one singlet signal with a g-factor of 2.0064 +/- 0.0005. Surprisingly, the ESR spectra of irradiated samples presented a new signal with g-factor of 2.0037 +/- 0.0003 which was independent of the type of cheese, and which might be due to free radicals from the radiolysis of proteins. Surface regression models (P < 0.0001) established the relationship among signal intensity, absorbed dose (0, 1, 2 and 4 kGy) and storage time (0-180 days) for the different types of cheese. Results suggested that the analysis by ESR (or electron paramagnetic resonance, EPR) is suitable to evaluate, either qualitatively or quantitatively, the irradiation treatment of different types of cheese.

AB The antisolvent coprecipitation method was utilized for fabricating the zein and hyaluronic acid complex at different mass ratios (100:5, 100:10, 100:15, 100:20, 100:25 and 100:30). Results showed that negatively charged zein-hyaluronic acid complex with small size (181.5 nm) was formed through the driving force of electrostatic attraction, followed by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic effects. The incorporation of hyaluronic acid led to conformational change of zein, and improved its physical and thermal stability. Native hyaluronic acid showed a three-dimensional network structure, while zein-hyaluronic acid binary complex exhibited two different microstructures, including nanoparticles (zein:hyaluronic acid, above 100:20) and particle-filled-microgel (zein:hyaluronic acid, below 100:20). In addition, zein-hyaluronic acid complex was designed as a new delivery vehicle to anti-thermal degradation and control release of quercetagetin. These findings indicated that zein-hyaluronic acid complex would be a useful and promising delivery vehicle for embedding and protecting bioactive compounds.

AB Fluorescent lateral flow immunoassay (FLFIA) based on immunomagnetic separation (IMS) has the advantage of sensitivity. However, its complex operation includes IMS, elution, incubation, and FLFIA steps. Here, we prepared a core@shell@satellite structure fluorescent magnetic nanobeads (FMNBs) and firstly introduced them into the novel method that integrated IMS with FLFIA (I-IMS-FLFIA) for the detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7. The FMNBs exhibited excellent magnetic and fluorescent properties for applications in IMS and FLFIA. However, the inner filter effect (IFE) of FMNBs may disturb the detection of I-IMS-FLFIA. Systematical studies showed that the amount of immuno-FMNBs and the concentration of monoclonal antibody can be controlled to obtain maximum photoluminescence intensity and effectively weaken or solve IFE. Under optimum conditions, this method allows for the quantified detection of 2.39x10(2) CFU/mL and qualified detection of 2.50x10(3) CFU/mL. The method is simple, safe, efficient, and sensitive for the detection of foodborne pathogens.

AB A shrimp extract (SME) obtained from the mild-acid demineralization treatment of shrimp shells to produce chitosan was collected. It was mainly composed of fat (approximate to 73%), protein (approximate to 19%), and ash (approximate to 9%) and contained considerable amounts of calcium (approximate to 1.9 g/100 g), astaxanthin (approximate to 30 mg/100 g) and unsaturated fatty acids (approximate to 27% MUFA, approximate to 39% PUFA). The SME was used in combination with chitosan for wrapping raw salmon to produce a ready-to-eat product enriched in calcium. No significant changes in hardness were found, as compared to the unwrapped salmon. Estimated intakes of bioaccessible calcium increased significantly by 3.6-fold, whereas intake of bioaccessible fat was reduced by 15%. SFA were the main fatty acid group reduced (approximate to 80%), whereas MUFA and PUFA were only reduced by approximate to 20% each. Total viable counts, pseudomonads, enterobacteria, and specific fish spoilers were reduced by 2-4 log CFU/g in wrapped sample during the chilled storage period (19 days).

AB We report an amperometric immunosensor for the detection of monosodium glutamate (MSG) using a glassy carbon electrode modified with gold nanoparticle decorated on a molybdenum disulfide/chitosan (Au@MoS2/Ch) nanocomposite. In the present detection technique, Au@MoS2/Ch was used as a conductive matrix and antiglutamate antibody was immobilized on to its surface via carbodiimide coupling method. Chemical and morphological attributes of the various components of the immunosensor were confirmed by UV-vis spectroscopy, SEM, TEM and XRD analysis. Electrochemical characterizations were carried out by CV, DPV and EIS. Overall results showed the effective fabrication of highly conductive Au@MoS2/Ch nanocomposite for sensitive electrochemical detection of MSG. A linear relationship was perceived between the change in current and concentration of MSG. The relationship was found to be consistent in the detection range of 0.05-200 mu M. Statistical validation of the assay showed limit of detection and limit of quantification values as 0.03 and 0.1 mu M, respectively (R-2 = 0.99).

AB The availability of analytical methods for quantification of allergens is crucial for the correct assessment and labeling of products in order to protect allergic consumers. For this purpose, a simple, sensitive and accurate technique was developed based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (LC-MRM-MS/MS). The proposed method uses a simple purification with heat and a completely optimized tryptic digestion. This method has been validated according to the requirements defined by ICH (Q2 [R1]), having a linear range from 0.10 to 1179.36 nM with r > 0.999. The parvalbumin beta in flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) has been quantified at a low level down to 0.10 mu g/g with satisfactory precision (RSD < 18.35%) and accuracy (< 13.3%). The new approach was successfully applied for the determination of parvalbumin beta in the other food matrices.

AB Rapid and reliable determination of atrazine, a common chemical contaminant, in agri-foods is highly necessary. We reported a novel dual-chemosensor coupling, a separation [molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs)], an instrumental-free detection [gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)-based colorimetric assay] and an instrument-based quantification [surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)] method for high-throughput and sensitive determination of atrazine in apple juice. Used as the selective sorbent for the solid phase extraction, MIPs effectively extracted atrazine from apple juice with high recoveries (similar to 93%). AuNPs of different sizes (large; medium; and small) performed differently in the two analytical methods. Large-AuNPs provided the highest sensitivity in colorimetric analysis (< 0.01 mg L-1), while medium-AuNPs achieved the lowest limit of detection (0.0012 mg L-1) and quantification (0.0040 mg L-1) in SERS analysis. With minor modifications, protocols for both analytical methods can rapidly detect and/or quantify atrazine in different food products complying with the Health Canada regulation (0.005 mg L-1).

AB Our previous results (Nakamura et al., 2013, 2016) indicated that acetylcholine (ACh) in orally administered foods exerts antihypertensive effects. Eggplants (Solanum melongena) contain abundant ACh (Horiuchi et al., 2003), and their food functionality was discovered, using spontaneously hypertensive rats, by measuring blood pressure after oral administration of a suspension of lyophilized eggplant powder. We found that lyophilized eggplant powder induced significantly lowered acute and chronic blood pressure levels at very low doses of 0.0650 mg/kg body weight (b.w.) and 0.821 mg/(kg b.w.day), respectively. Chronic administration suppressed adrenaline and noradrenaline excretion in the urine, and aorta assays showed that eggplant acted on the M3 muscarinic ACh receptor (M3 mAChR). ACh was conclusively shown to function as the main component of eggplant contributing to antihypertensive activity by suppressing sympathetic nervous activity via M3 mAChR. This report reveals a new food functionality of eggplant and its potential as a novel antihypertensive food.

AB Traditionally, the root of Pueraria lobata are widely used as a functional food. It was observed that a 70% ethanol extract showed a dose-dependent inhibition towards mushroom tyrosinase. Among the different isolated compounds, calycosin demonstrated potent inhibitory activity against substrates L-tyrosine and L-DOPA, with IC50 of 1.45 +/- 0.03 and 7.02 +/- 0.46 mu M, respectively. Conversely, formononetin and daidzein exhibit weak inhibition. Moreover, kinetic studies revealed calycosin to be a competitive inhibitor for both substrates. Additionally, molecular docking simulation showed that the hydroxyl groups at C-3' and C-7 positions interacted with the catalytic site and peripheral residues, demonstrating a higher affinity toward mushroom tyrosinase. Accordingly, our results suggest that, rather than a mono-substituted hydroxyl or methoxyl group, the presence of a hydroxyl group at C-3' and a methoxyl group at C-4' position of the isoflavone skeleton plays an essential role in the manifestation of anti-browning activity in food products.

AB A simultaneous method for analyzing sodium iron chlorophyllin (SIC) and sodium copper chlorophyllin (SCC) using high-performance liquid chromatography was developed. This method employed an Inertsil ODS-2 column and diode array detection at 395 nm, using methanol-water (97:3 and 80:20, v/v) containing 1% acetic acid as the mobile phase. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify the main components of SIC and SCC as Fe-isochlorine e4 and Cu-isochlorine e4, respectively. The limits of detection and quantitation of SIC were 1.2 and 4.1 mg/kg, respectively, while those of SCC were 1.4 and 4.8 mg/kg, respectively. For intraday and interday tests, the SIC recoveries from candy ranged from 81% to 101%, while SCC recoveries ranged from 100% to 109%. The developed method can be applied to the rapid determination of SIC and SCC in candy.

AB Lycopene was combined with the glucosides of each of the six common anthocyanidins at 3 different ratios to investigate their interactions on antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, and cellular uptake. The bioactivity interaction between lycopene and anthocyanins was studied in both chemical and cellular models. Anti-oxidative synergy was not seen in any of the tested lycopene-anthocyanin mixtures, nor in the models studied. When lycopene was paired with the methoxylated anthocyanins, the anti-inflammatory effect on the inhibition of the cytokine IL-8, which is a pro-inflammatory biomarker, was increased by 15-69% of the expected additive activity, indicating synergistic interaction between the compounds. The cellular uptake of lycopene was significantly impaired by the presence of the anthocyanins: reduced by 50-80% at the lycopene: anthocyanin combinatory ratios of 2.5:7.5 mu M (1:3) or 5:5 mu M (1:1). The reduced intracellular lycopene content might be partly responsible for the antagonistic cellular antioxidant property seen in some of the tested mixtures.

AB Acylated anthocyanins from purple-fleshed sweet potato (PFSP) have been reported to have multiple benefits to human health. Although, the bioavailability of these anthocyanins remains unknown. In the present study, a characterization of the gastrointestinal bioavailability of PFSP anthocyanins was assayed and compared with the bioavailability of Red Wine anthocyanins. Acylated anthocyanins showed higher resistance to overall simulated digestions when compared to less complex anthocyanins from Red wine, with degradation at the intestinal level of about 30% and 45%, respectively. Transport rates of absorption of acylated anthocyanins were not dependent on the cell type. However, a higher transport efficiency was observed in gastric cells (8%) when compared to the intestinal cells (5%). Glucose and proteins, but not starch, decreased the transport efficiency of anthocyanins in about 3-7% in gastric cells and 2-3% in intestinal cells. These results bring new insights and lay the groundwork for further research on acylated anthocyanins bioavailability.

AB A modified QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) method was developed for the simultaneous determination of veterinary drugs, pesticides and mycotoxins in eggs by ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Several extraction conditions were tested and optimized, and the obtained extraction efficiency of all the targeted compounds (particularly macrolides) could fulfill the requirements. In the purification procedure, magnetic multiwalled carbon nanotubes (Fe3O4-MWCNTs) were used as adsorbents, and an external magnet was utilized to achieve a faster adsorbent separation, compared to the traditional centrifugation process. The recoveries of all analytes were in the range of 60.5%-114.6% at three fortified levels with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of less than 20%, and the LOQs ranged from 0.1 mu g.kg(-1) to 17.3 mu g.kg(-1). This method was successfully applied to the analysis of egg samples, demonstrating its applicability and suitability for the routine analysis of multiclass residues in egg samples.

AB The aim of this work was to evaluate how the use of mixed cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Lachancea thermotolerans indigenous yeast strains influences the volatile composition of wine. Multivariate curve resolution (MCR) method has been applied to data analysis. Five fermentation trials were carried out: three co-inoculated with L. thermotolerans: S. cerevisiae, at the ratio of 50:1, 20:1 and 5:1 respectively, and two with a pure culture of each strain. A must from sun-dried Pedro Ximenez grapes was employed. Volatile composition was determined by dual sequential stir bar sorptive extraction, followed by GC-MS analysis. MCR provided 171 peaks. Results in co-inoculation fermentations revealed that the majority compounds obtained in each case followed the same trend as that observed for the pure culture of the strain that was present in a higher proportion. Finally, 50:1 and 20:1 seemed to be the best proportions to obtain a wine with a quality volatile profile.

AB Deoxynivalenol (DON), a notorious mycotoxin mainly found in Fusarium-contaminated crops, causes great loss in livestock farming and severe safety risks to human health. Here we report the isolation of a Gram-negative bacterial strain with effective biodegrading abilities on DON and its derivatives including 3-acetyl-DON and 15-acetyl-DON. The strain was identified as Devosia insulae A16 on the basis of morphological and physiological characteristics and 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic analysis. D. insulae A16 was able to degrade 88% of 20 mg/l DON within 48 h under aerobic conditions at 35 degrees C and neutral pH. The major degradation product of DON and its derivatives was 3-keto-DON by the oxidation of the hydroxyl group at C-3. Both 3-acetyl-DON and 15-acetyl-DON underwent a deacetylation reaction to generate DON prior to the degradation to 3-keto-DON. The results provide the potential use of D. insulae A16 as a biodegradation agent to control DON contamination in cereals.

AB The release of biscuit Maillard reaction products (MRP) with antioxidant capacity was compared by in vitro and in vivo studies. Antioxidant determinations were performed by DPPH, FRAP and ICRED. Results indicated that an intense heat treatment on biscuits increases the amount of MRP with antioxidant capacity (p < 0.05). Besides, a low amount of antioxidant compounds was obtained after enzymatic digestion, whereas the highest proportion was released by colonic bacteria. Moreover, a high amount of non-released antioxidant compounds remained in faeces of Wistar rats; this was only predicted by in vitro ICRED determination. In addition, an increase in the stool amount and in the cecum weight/body weight ratio was observed in animals fed with a diet enriched in MRP (p < 0.05), which indicated a possible prebiotic activity. In conclusion, the in vitro digestion/fermentation procedure combined with ICRED determination would be a useful methodology to predict the release of antioxidant MRP in vivo.

AB The color changes of Chinese bayberry wines during storage is a wide and urgent problem and its mechanism is still not clear. The changes of composition and color parameters of Chinese bayberry wines were studied during 70 days of storage in the dark at three different temperatures (4, 25 and 37 degrees C). The L*, a*, b*, anthocyanins, total phenols, and total flavonoids decreased along with the increase of polymeric pigments at all temperatures while 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural and browning index increased only at 37 degrees C. The degradation of anthocyanins followed a first-order kinetic model. No furfurals and ascorbic acid were detected at all temperatures during storage. Wines stored at higher temperature showed higher polymeric pigments. The result probably indicated phenols especially anthocyanins and polymeric pigments seem to be main factors than Maillard reaction in the color changes of Chinese bayberry wines during storage.

AB Thiol-functionalized magnetic carbon nanotubes (TMCNTs) were employed as the sorbent in the magnetic micro-solid phase extraction (M-mu-SPE) of sulfonamide antibiotics (SAs) in water, milks and chicken meat products prior to high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) analysis. The synthesized sorbent was characterized by several spectroscopic techniques. Optimum conditions were: 20 mg of TMCNTs at pH 4, 2 min extraction time, 10% addition of salt and 30 mL of sample volume. Under the optimized TMCNTs-M-mu-SPE and HPLC-DAD conditions, the method showed good linearity in the range of 0.1-500 mu g L-1 (r(2) >= 0.9950), low limits of detection (0.02-1.5 mu g L-1), good analytes recovery (80.7-116.2%) and acceptable RSDs (0.3-7.7%, n = 15). The method was applied to tap water (1), milks (15) and commercial chicken meat products (35), SAs were detected in five chicken meat samples (3.0-25.7 mu g L-1). The method is critically compared to those reported in the literature.

AB The bioactive hydrophilic dihydrochalcone, aspalathin, has poor stability and bioavailability hampering its use in functional food ingredients with standardised aspalathin content. The aim of the study was to produce nanoparticles with controlled release to overcome these obstacles. Nanoencapsulation was investigated using both natural (chitosan and lecithin) and synthetic (poly(lactide-co-glycolide) and Eudragit S100 (R) (ES100)) polymers by suitable conventional methods and electrospraying for all polymers. All polymer-method combinations produced particles smaller than 1.1 mu m. Electrospraying produced more favourable results than conventional methods for the synthetic polymers, resulting in spherical particles with higher (p < 0.05) encapsulation efficiencies (> 50%) and loading capacities (> 10%). Opposite trends were observed for natural polymers. An in vitro release study revealed biphasic aspalathin release profiles at pH 7.4 with ES100 electrosprayed nanoparticles having the slowest (p < 0.05) release rate (1.67 h(-1)). Overall, ES100 electrosprayed nanoparticles showed the most favourable combination of parameters.

AB Jaboticaba (Myrciaria cauliflora) is considered a "super fruit" due to its remarkable phenolic content and antioxidant capacity. Despite the great potential of its peels, to our knowledge the investigation of novel nanostructured systems with this natural raw material, still considered an industrial residue, is scarce. The present study aimed to obtain nanodispersions with its peel's extract through a low energy method. Antioxidant assays were performed, showing positive results for DPPH (IC50 = 0.89 mu g/mL) and FRAP (225.53 mu mol equivalent ferrous sulphate/g). The chemical characterization in terms of flavonoids (2.56%) and total monomeric anthocyanins (0.80%) contents were also performed. Overall, the nanodispersion prepared with the non-ionic surfactant polysorbate 85 and the hydroalcoholic extract standardized in ellagic acid (129 mu g/mL) presented the best properties regarding particle size distribution and zeta potential. Thus, it opens perspectives for the generation of novel food-grade nanodispersions through an ecofriendly approach that is in accordance to sustainable concepts.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the oenological potential of natural extracts from winery and cooperage by-products, either alone or with a colloidal silver complex (CSC), on the quality of red wines, as possible substitutes to SO2. Natural extracts were obtained from grape seeds and American oak wood by accelerated extraction with subcritical water. The prefermentative addition of grape seed or oak wood extracts was an useful tool to control acetic acid bacteria development, without affecting the alcoholic and malolactic fermentations. Both extracts protected the wines against oxidation, without negatively modifying their phenolic and volatile composition. They did not cause organoleptic defects in wines, which presented greater aromatic complexity and were positively evaluated by the tasters. Therefore, the use of grape seed or oak wood extracts in red vinification could be a good alternative to replace or reduce the doses of SO2.

AB The optimum thermosonication parameters, temperature and ultrasound energy density (UED), determined by using response surface methodology to inactivate polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and protecting the quality parameters, especially color of strawberry nectar. The PPO inactivation was successfully achieved by thermosonication treatment. Increasing of temperature resulted with decreasing of browning index and increasing of hydroxymethyl furfural. High temperature-low UED combination can be applied to obtain minimum change in Delta E* and maximum protection of ascorbic acid. Thermosonication at mild temperature (similar to 50 degrees C) and UED (similar to 230 J/g) ensured the maximum levels of total monomeric anthocyanin and total phenolic content. The combination of 59 degrees C and 455 J/g was the conditions of optimum thermosonication to minimize quality parameters which cause undesirable changes like color degradation in nectar and maximize desirable ones which have beneficial effects on characteristics of nectar or on human health like phenolic content of nectar.

AB Pectinolytic enzymes are used in diverse industrial applications. We sought to isolate a pectate lyase from Aspergillus luchuensis var. saitoi, a filamentous fungus used in traditional food and beverage preparation in Japan. The identified enzyme, named AsPelA, is orthologous to PelA from A. luchuensis mut. kawachii (AkPelA); the enzymes exhibit 99% amino acid sequence identity, with Ile140 and Val197 of AsPelA being replaced by Val and Asp in AkPelA, respectively. AsPelA activity decreased to 71%, 61%, and 46% of maximal activity after 60-min incubation at 60 degrees C, 70 degrees C, and 80 degrees C, whereas AkPelA activity dropped to 16%, 10%, and 8.5%, respectively, indicating that AsPelA is more thermostable than AkPelA. Furthermore, AsPelA was stable within a neutral-to-alkaline pH range, as well as in the presence of organic solvents, detergents, and metal ions. Our findings suggest that AsPelA represents a candidate pectate lyase for applications in food, paper, and textile industries.

AB The aim of the research was to analyze the influence of chemical composition, technological and sensory pork quality on the formation of heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) after heat treatment. Material for analysis was taken from 36 samples of pork with different ultimate pH. The results showed that the studied meat was characterized by variation in chemical composition, especially in precursors of HAAs. The formation of HAAs in meat was significantly related to ultimate pH (r = -0.80), glucose concentration (r = 0.60) and color parameters (r = 0.61-0.80). These studies also demonstrated the increased amount of HAAs in meat with higher temperature of grilling. Raising the grill temperature from 180 degrees C to 220 degrees C resulted in a two-fold increase in the 4,8-DiMeIQx content and nine-fold 7,8-DiMeIQx. In the case of grilling at 220 degrees C, the increase in 7,8-DiMeIQx content was accompanied by a decrease in tenderness and juiciness (r = -0.60) and deterioration of overall quality (r = 0.70).

AB Tropomyosin (TM) from Exopalaemon modestus was glycoprotein, the effects of deglycosylation (enzyme and chemical regents) and Maillard reaction on the conformation, allergenicity and human cell sensitization of TM were investigated. TM had both N-glycan and O-glycan. After deglycosylation and glycation, the alpha-helix of TM reduced, while other secondary structures promoted. Deglycosylation enhanced TM allergenicity and digestibility, contributed to digests with lower allergenicity, glucose glycation weakened the allergenicity and digestibility of TM, led to digests with weaker allergenicity. Gastric digestion partly reduced allergenicity of digests, intestinal digestion highly reduced digests' allergenicity, gastrointestinal digestion most efficiently weakened the allergenicity of digests. After deglycosylation, the deglycosylated TM exerted stronger activation of basophil (KU812), while glucose glycated TM weakened KU812 activation. Deglycosylation exerted inhibition on colon cell (Caco-2) proliferation and increase of IL-8 release, while glucose glycated TM suppressed Caco-2 proliferation and IL-8 release.

AB The study was undertaken to gain insight into the nitrogen status of grape juices currently used to make commercial wines in South Africa. This was done as yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN) is most often suspected as the cause for problematic fermentations and has major implications for the organoleptic qualities of the final product. Using exploratory statistical methods, this study explored the possibility of identifying the role of cultivar and grape-growing district in the determination of the concentration and composition of YAN. However, as the dataset was found to be non-parametric and heteroscedastic, paired with unequal sample sizes, data analysis was approached with caution. Through the use of various suitable statistical analyses, cultivar was shown to play the more important role in determining the concentration and composition of YAN.

AB This study aimed to establish a precise HPLC-MS approach to determine the concentrations and distribution of major phenolic acids in six categories of vegetables that are commonly consumed in China. We detected 17 phenolic acids within 15 min under optimized conditions. The method showed detection limits varying from 0.008 mg/L to 0.042 mg/L, average recoveries ranging from 71.0% to 110.7%, and a RSD of <= 9.98%. The average concentrations of total phenolic acids followed the order of flower > root > leafy > stem > bean > fruit vegetables. The phenolic acids were more abundant in the leafy, root, and stem vegetables than in the other vegetable samples. Furthermore, the levels of isoferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid were greater than those of other phenolic acids in the vegetables. Free soluble phenolic acids were the dominant species in all vegetables (P < 0.001), except in the stem vegetables (P < 0.027).

AB The use of selected Saccharomyces cerevisiae PS7314, Lactobacillus rossiae NOS7307, Lactobacillus brevis NOS7311, and Lactobacillus plantarum NOS7315 as mono-culture or co-culture for production of sourdoughs, their breads showed different physical and organoleptic properties. The pH of breads fermented with sourdoughs incubated with mono-culture or co-culture all decreased. An opposite trend was found for TTA. The use of single lactobacillus for the dough fermentation decreased the specific volume of bread, which was 4.15-19.10% lower than that of control bread (CB). However, the synergetic fermentation helped the improvement of bread quality. Compared to CB, the mixed culture 4 sourdough remarkably decreased the hardness by 52.08%, increased the specific volume by 5.29%, improved porosity of final product by 24.90%, and gave a preferable sensory characteristic to bread. Thus, the MC4 could be recommended for replacing spontaneous sourdough for improving the quality of bread.

AB In the present study sunflower protein isolates were subjected to heat treatment (80 degrees C for 5 min, 15 min and 25 min) at three pH values (3.5, 4.5 and 5.5). The strength of gel prepared from treated protein isolates was lower than the gels from native protein isolates and gel strength increased with increase in temperature treatment. Higher denaturation temperatures were observed in treated protein isolates than native protein isolates and increased with increase in thermal treatment time. Treated protein isolates showed more resistance against thermal degradation than native protein isolates as was evident from thermal gravimetric analysis. Secondary and tertiary structure determined by circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence respectively were significantly altered after thermal treatment. Lower crystal size along with reduced crystallinity was observed in treated protein isolates than native protein isolates and was further reduced with increase in heating time as was determined by X-ray diffraction.

AB The aim of the study was to investigate the application of berry density sorting as a tool for the selection of grapes with different volatile and precursor profiles. The study was carried out on Moscato giallo, Malvasia di Schierano, Malvasia nera lunga, and Brachetto aromatic grape varieties. Free and glycosidically-bound terpene compounds including linalool, geraniol, nerol, citronellol, and terpineol, as well as lipoxygenases activity-derived compounds, were evaluated using head space-solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) in density sorted berries (1075-1119 kg m(-3)). Total free terpenes changed with the berry density, while no significant changes were found in total glycosylated compounds, except for Malvasia nera lunga grapes where nerol, linalool, and geraniol contributed strongly to the increase of total contents with increasing berry density. Given that these variations were strongly variety-dependent, the possible use of density sorting equipment in winery for this aim may be less effective.

AB Although black rice has gained popularity, the changes in volatiles produced during black rice storage remain unclear. Herein, the volatile composition of unmilled and milled black rice stored at 25 degrees C or 35 degrees C for 0-12 months was investigated by headspace solid-phase microextraction with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Fifty-four volatiles were identified, 15 of which were not previously identified in black rice, including 4-propylbenzaldehyde, methyl 2-hydroxybenzoate, methyl 2-methylpentanoate, 2,5-dimethylnonane, 5-methyldecane, and 2-methylundecane. In this study, octanal increased at a high rate during early storage compared with hexanal, a traditional oxidation marker; thus, octanal may be an early oxidation marker in black rice. The results suggested that high temperature is not appropriate for storage of unmilled or milled black rice because it promotes lipid oxidation, producing volatile compounds. At 25 degrees C, black rice stored for short times such as 3 months should be milled, whereas for 6 months, black rice should be stored without milling.

AB The present work describes efficient hydrolysis of native starch by a novel beta-amylase from peanut (Arachis hypogaea). The Dextrose Equivalent value, which is a measure of starch hydrolysis, for potato and corn starch increased significantly by 40% and 10%, respectively, releasing maltose. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that enzymatic corrosion occurred mainly at the surface of starch granules, leaving broken granules to smaller particles at later stage of digestion. Further, X-ray analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy displayed the loss of ordered structure in the enzyme degraded starches. These results described the pattern of hydrolysis. Since the action of already known plant beta-amylases (sweet potato and soybean) on native starch granule is not very effective and requires gelatinization for maltose production, beta-amylase from peanut could be a useful alternative in the present endeavor. It would potentially save time and money arising from gelatinization and lead to improvements in industrial maltose production.

AB The use of alfalfa protein in human food is limited by its low quality. Response Surface Methodology was employed to optimise the combined effects of different steam blanching conditions on the enzymatic activity, browning and protein degrading which cause undesirable characteristics. The optimum conditions were: steaming time 4.36 min, particle size 23 mm, time from harvesting to steaming 2 h leading to a residual activity of polyphenol oxidase of 1.31% and a completely inactivation of peroxidase. The Browning Index value was 108.3 and the non-protein nitrogen 170.2 (g kg(-1) TN). The browning and protein degradation rates of alfalfa treated under the optimum conditions were much lower than the control alfalfa after 60 days ensiling. This suggests that blanching of fresh whole alfalfa leaves under the optimum conditions was helpful for avoiding the appearance of the dark color and degradation of the extracted protein, improving its quality for human consumption.

AB This study aimed to isolate starches of a high purity from starch-rich pea, lentil and faba bean flours and to characterize and compare the isolated starches with important commercial starches. Isolated pulse starches had a purity of 94.8-97.9% and contained only 0.9-1.1% damaged starch. The isolated pulse starches showed amylose contents and amylopectin branch-chain-length distributions similar to those of commercial pea starch. Therefore, the granular morphologies, crystalline structure, thermal properties, pasting properties, gelling ability and in vitro digestibility of the isolated pulse starches were comparable to those of commercial pea starch but different from those of commercial maize and tapioca starches. The desirable functionality of the pulse starches (e.g., strong gelling ability) renders them suitable for some specific industrial applications, and further modifications can be utilized to enhance their functionality for broader use. This research provided the fundamental knowledge required for future efforts to promote value-added utilization of pulse starches.

AB Arsenic (As) is a carcinogenic element threatening the health of millions of people around the world. The sources for human exposure include drinking water, crops, processed food items, vegetables, mushrooms, animal products etc. The people at most risk are those living in hotspots of As contamination viz., Bangladesh and West Bengal, India. However, it has been found that rice growing in other uncontaminated regions like Australia can also contain high As levels. Further, rice import/export among various countries make the problem of global concern. The emergence of several reports of As in rice based food products including baby food from different parts of the world demonstrates that even the infants and toddlers are not spared. The variation in the levels of inorganic and organic As species in different food items influence the associated As toxicity. This review tries to present the available data on As levels in various dietary sources.

AB Infant formula products are predominantly manufactured using cow milk protein; goat milk also provides a suitable protein source. In this study, we directly compared cow and goat milk protein digestion using pH and enzyme conditions to simulate infant gastric conditions. Generated peptides, identified using liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer, show both similarities and differences in cow and goat milk post-digestion profiles. The majority of peptides were from casein proteins, 50% representing beta-casein, with many peptides unique to each species. Low or no peptides for beta-Lactoglobulin and alpha-Lactalbumin, respectively, suggest these proteins were highly resistant to infant gastric digestion, as reported by others. Minor milk proteins, comprising 5% of peptides, were represented by different proteins from cow and goat. Peptides with known bioactivities were also observed, both in common and unique to each species. Together these data may explain reported differences in digestion characteristics of cow and goat milk.

AB The bitter taste of Cyclopia genistoides infusions is unacceptable to consumers, who are used to the slightly sweet taste of the herbal teas produced from other Cyclopia species. Bitter taste intensities of crude phenolic fractions of a bitter hot water extract of C. genistoides were determined by a trained panel to identify the fraction contributing most to the bitter taste. Fractions, enriched in benzophenones (B), xanthones (X) and flavanones (F), and each tested at their infusion equivalent concentration (IEC) scored 5, 31 and 13 (on a 100-point scale), respectively. Fraction B, containing mostly iriflophenone glucosides, was perceived as not bitter. The major xanthone in fraction X, mangiferin, was significantly (p < 0.05) more bitter than its regio-isomer, isomangiferin, at equal concentration. A mixture of isomangiferin and mangiferin at their IECs was significantly (p < 0.05) less bitter than the mangiferin solution alone, indicating bitter suppression by isomangiferin.

AB Monomer formation from dimeric DHA has previously been suggested as the rate-determining step in formation of methylglyoxal, the bioactive component in manuka honey. This step was studied by H-1 NMR in DMSO-d(6). First order reaction rate was 3.31 x 10(-3) +/- 9.1 x 10(-4) min(-1). Upon titration with D2O, little change was observed until similar to 15 mass% whereupon an exponential increase in rate occurred until indistinguishable from the rate observed in water. Acid or base caused rate accelerations. Theoretical modelling confirmed the existence of acid and base-catalysed mechanisms for dimer decomposition and the structures of two intermediates observed. In honey it is likely the base-catalysed decomposition predominates with water as catalyst but there is little rate acceleration at the levels of water present normally in honey however a small increase in the mass% of water in the honey could cause significant rate acceleration of dimer decomposition and hence formation of methylglyoxal.

AB Oenococcus oeni was encapsulated into inter-penetrated polymer networks of silica-alginate (SiO2-ALG). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis proved the presence and the polycondensation of the siliceous material used in SiO2-ALG capsules. Environmental scanning electron microscopy showed that the structure of SiO2-ALG biocapsules was rougher than in alginate (ALG) biocapsules. The behaviour of SiO2-ALG biocapsules was evaluated at pH 3.0-3.6 and alcohol degrees of 12-15%. Repeated-batch malolactic fermentations (MLF) demonstrated that SiO2-ALG biocapsules can be reused efficiently for five times in either low-pH or high-ethanol wines, while free bacteria only can be used once under the most favourable MLF conditions. The inclusion of siliceous materials into ALG hydrogel improved the stability of the biocapsules, reducing their shrinking and achieving an excellent integrity under winemaking conditions. These results proved the possibility of industrial application of SiO2-ALG biocapsules in winemaking.

AB The aggregation of alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin and beta-casein after heating in dry state was studied in absence and presence of saccharides. In absence of saccharides, differences were observed in the extent of aggregation. Differences between the proteins were mostly due to differences in covalent aggregation. The presence of glucose during the heat treatment of milk proteins significantly increased the extent of aggregation, and decreased differences between proteins. alpha-Lactalbumin was selected as a model protein for the study of cross-links formed after heat treatment. In the presence of saccharides, these cross-links were found to consist of 36% of disulphide bridges (compared to > 75% in the absence of glucose), followed by other cross-links such as lanthionine. Larger saccharides led to a decrease in Maillard induced aggregation; maltotriose actually even inhibited the formation of alpha-lactalbumin aggregates.

AB Three techniques of ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) and solvent extraction (SE) were used for enhancing the hydroxytyrosol (HT), maslinic acid (MA) and oleanolic acid (OA) extraction from olive pomace, being evaluated and compared through process parameters, kinetics and thermodynamics, plus greenness assessment analysis. Results showed that UAE yielded the maximum compounds due to a strong cavitation effect and the strongest mass and heat transfer efficiency involving the kinetic constants (h, C-e and K) and thermodynamic parameters (Delta H, Delta S and Delta G). Additionally, the optimal extraction conditions were acquired: ethanol concentration of 90%, extraction temperature of 50 degrees C, extraction time of 5 min, liquid to solid ratio of 30 mL/g, ultrasound intensity of 135.6 W/cm(2), and ultrasound frequency of 60 kHz. UAE was confirmed as an effective and greener technique with the lowest E factor, energy consumption and carbon emission during the extraction process of bioactive compounds from olive pomace.

AB Lipophenols, esterified phenols with fatty acids, have attracted increasing attention because of their better protective effects in lipid-based food matrices from oxidation. However, little is known about their digestion. In this study, the digestive stability of resveratrol (RSV) esters with caprylic acid (RCAPs) in a model gastrointestinal digestion system was evaluated. The results demonstrated that RCAPs were relatively stable without hydrolysis in mouth and gastric phases. However, in the intestinal phase, pancreatic lipase rather than phospholipase A(2) could hydrolyze monoester and diesters to free RSV. After 120 min of incubation at 37 degrees C, 53.68% of monoester and 11.36% of diesters were hydrolyzed. However, no hydrolysis of the triester was noticed. Obviously, the level of hydrolysis of RCAPs was negatively correlated with the degree of substitution. Therefore, it was speculated that RSV in fatty acid ester forms could partially be absorbed by intestinal lumen in the form of free RSV.

AB The use of Allium species and their extracts has been known since immemorial times due to their health beneficial properties. It is known that functional properties of Allium genus come from the high content of bioactive compounds. The biological activity of Allium extracts will be conditioned by the type of Allium variety, agricultural conditions, and specific extraction process used since all these factors affect the content and the profile of bioactive compounds. Innovative extraction techniques in comparison to conventional processes could be considered as a promising tool to recover bioactive compounds from Allium spp. with antimicrobial and antiinflammatory properties. Trying to fill the gap in the literature, this paper reviews the chemical composition, the effects of processing on the nutritional and bioactive composition of Allium species and their extracts. Moreover, the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects, as well as the bioavailability of bioactive compounds of edible members from the Allium genus is discussed.

AB In this study, ten strains of Lactobacillus were used to assess the in vitro metabolism of elderberry juice polyphenols. Total polyphenolic compounds increased after starter addition, especially with three L. rhamnosus and one L. plantarum strains, of dairy origin: quercetin-3-O-rutinoside was the most abundant compound (from 39.02 +/- 5.28 to 127.56 +/- 11.34 mu g/mL) and hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonols and anthocyanins reached the highest amounts. When L. plantarum were used phenyllactic acids presented a value of 7.05 +/- 2.38 mu g/mL, while in the other samples it was around 5.56 +/- 1.65 mu g/mL. Hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic acids were subjected to lactic acid bacteria metabolism: caffeic and protocatechuic acids were consumed during fermentation while dihydrocaffeic acid and catechol were produced. Anthocyanins increased in a strain-specific way. So, by this study we highlighted that dairy strains can produced (phenyllactic acids), modified (hydroxycinnamic acids) or increased (flavonols glycosides and anthocyanins) phenolic compounds.

AB Basil (Ocimum basilicum) from the Lamiaceae family is among the most important medicinal plants, and its seed fatty acid (FA) composition and quantity affects its nutritional and health values. It was hypothesized basil species and geographical properties significantly affect seed FA composition and quantity, which has not been previously investigated, to our knowledge. The collected seeds of the 18 basil populations were planted in a farmer's field, and the seed saturated (palmitic and stearic) and unsaturated (oleic, linoleic, and linolenic) FA were determined. Shiraz1 (14.7%) and Mobarakeh (5.1%) had the highest and the least rates of total FA, respectively. The populations were significantly different in terms of saturated FA ranging from 10.73% (Ardestan) to 13.51% (Bid Zard). However, the seed unsaturated FA (expect linoleic acid) were not significantly different from each other (average = 87.27%). Basil species and geographical properties significantly affected basil saturated FA and just unsaturated linoleic acid.

AB In this study, a sensitive monoclonal antibody (mAb) against toltrazuril (Tol) was developed based on a novel hapten. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of toltrazuril and its metabolites ranged from 2.19 ng/mL to 4.21 ng/mL. Based on this mAb, a colorimetric paper-based sensor was developed for the rapid screening of Tol and its metabolites in samples. The proposed assay has cutoff values of < 20 mu g/kg for Tol and 50 mu g/kg for Tol sulfone when evaluated with the naked eye, and the results could be obtained in 15 min. Quantitative results were obtained with a strip scan reader, with limits of detection < 2.60 mu g/kg for Tol and its metabolites in real samples. The sensitivity of both qualitative and quantitative detection meets the European Union requirements. Therefore, this strip assay provides a useful tool for the on-site detection and rapid initial screening of Tol and its derivatives in feed, egg, and chicken samples.

AB Insects are seen as a solution to the increasing demand for protein sources for food. However, entomophagy has unfortunately been linked to allergic reactions in Europe with people with professional contacts. As mealworms (Tenebrio molitor) and crickets (Acheta domesticus) have recently become commercially available (both whole or in food formulation) in several European countries, this research assessed the cross allergenicity of arginine kinase (AK). Based on the collection of sera from a entomology laboratory staff, oven cooked insects but also purified AK fractions were tested. Immunoblotting against the protein extracts revealed different Immunoglobulin E reactivity of sera according to the insect target species: two bands (40 and 14 kDa) for crickets and a pattern including light responses at 17, 25 and 37 kDa for mealworms. Focusing on AK, low specific allergenicity was here illustrated and discussed in relation to the development of a safe edible insect consumption by humans.

AB Taking advantage of the low oxidation potential of polyphenolic compounds, voltammetric techniques, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) are used rather indiscriminately. In this work, we report Total Polyphenols results (TPP) obtained by these two techniques from a set of nine samples of red and Tawny Port wine. The CV and DPV voltammograms display significant correlations with the physical-chemical parameters used to characterize red and Tawny Port wines, particularly with polyphenols. Although data obtained from CV and DPV for a single polyphenol are directly proportional, important deviations are found between voltammetric results from wines. Results from CV tend to be larger than those from DPV. This difference, that can reach 50% of the TPP value, was related to the presence of total sulphur dioxide. In view of the present study, the polyphenol quantification in wines should be performed by DPV to minimize the interference of SO2.

AB Oregano, a widely used and popular herb, is particularly vulnerable to fraud. Less valued plants, adulterants that are often used for dilution, may introduce into this commodity additional contaminants such as pesticide residues. In this study, more than 400 pesticides were screened in a representative set of 42 genuine and 34 adulterated dried oregano samples collected from various locations across Europe. The results obtained by advanced mass spectrometry-based methods, showed, that some pesticide residues could be detected in virtually all tested samples, nevertheless, on average, higher contamination was found in the adulterated oregano samples. Increased incidence of insecticides such as cyfluthrin, permethrin and cyhalothrin was typical for these samples, moreover, pyriproxyfen was detected exclusively in adulterated samples. Thus, based on a critical assessment of pesticide profiles, suspected adulterated oregano samples can be selected for follow up authenticity testing.

AB Extraction of protein from macroalgae, currently defined as "novel food", is challenging and limited information about the health impacts of these proteins is available. Here, we report on a non-thermal, chemical-free green macroalgae Ulva sp. protein extraction by osmotic shock combined with pulsed electric fields (PEF) followed by hydraulic pressure. The extracted proteins were identified and annotated to allergens using sequence similarity. The allergenicity potential of PEF extracted proteins was compared to osmotic shock extracts and complete Ulva sp. proteome, extracted with the thermochemical method. The PEF extracts contained 'superoxide dismutase' (SOD), a known food allergen, osmotic shock extract contained 'troponin C', and thermochemical extract contained two additional potential food allergens 'aldolase A' and 'thioredoxin h'. This study shows an importance and the need for deep investigation of algal proteins and protein extraction technology health impacts prior to large-scale release to the market of "novel food" derived proteins.

AB The phenethylamine alkaloid hordenine, present in germinated barley, was identified recently as a functionally selective dopamine D2 receptor agonist contributing potentially to the rewarding effects of drinking beer. Here, it was shown that the hordenine precursor N-methyltyramine binds with a similar affinity to the dopamine D2 receptor as hordenine (K-i 31.3 mu M) showing also selectivity towards the G protein-mediated pathway over the beta-arrestin pathway. Using a newly developed UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS method to monitor beer production, we demonstrated that hordenine and N-methyltyramine were released continuously from barley malt during mashing and were stable during fermentation and conditioning. The amounts released from different base malt types were in a similar range but tended to be higher from caramel malts. Hordenine and N-methyltyramine concentrations in 24 types of beer varied between 1.05-6.32 and 0.59-4.61 mg/L, respectively.

AB Starch granule-associated proteins (SGAPs) including granule-surface proteins and granule-channel proteins in waxy, low- and high-amylose rice starch were extracted and identified. The in vitro digestibility of starch was investigated before and after the extraction of granule-channel proteins or total SGAPs. The results showed that 10 types of major differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) including 14-3-3-like protein and ribosomal protein were found among starches. In addition, the lack of only granule-channel proteins or total SGAPs led to significant and different changes in the levels of rapidly digestible starch, slowly digestible starch and resistant starch. Possible mechanisms are related to the accessibility of amylase into starch granules and structural properties of SGAPs. This study provides more information about DEPs in rice starch with different amylose content and supports further study on the relationship between SGAPs and in vitro starch digestibility.

AB To understand the allergenicity of rice bran, the distribution of rice allergens in brown rice grains was analysed and the allergenicity of cosmetics and health foods containing rice bran determined. RAG2 and a 19-kDa globulin were localized in polished rice, while a 52-kDa globulin was localized in rice bran. The 52-kDa globulin was also identified as the most likely causative allergen of rice bran allergy. Several products containing intact rice bran were found to contain the 52-kDa globulin. Our study provides the first data regarding cosmetics and health foods containing potential rice bran allergens. Western blot analysis using a rice-bran-allergic patient's plasma showed that 52-kDa globulin was detected as an IgE-binding protein of rice bran and some rice bran-containing cosmetics and health foods. Our results indicate that patients with rice bran allergy need to be careful about using products containing intact rice bran as a constituent.

AB Sinapine is the main secondary metabolite present in rapeseed pomace (RSP) with its concentration being dependent on rapeseed processing, growing conditions, extraction parameters and the country of origin. Here we report, the concentration of sinapine from an extract of defatted RSP harvested in the North East of Scotland. Using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, the most abundant phenolic compound in the RSP extract was, as expected, sinapine (109.1 mg/g RSP extract). Additionally, sinapic, caffeic, ferulic and syringic acids were identified (0.159-3.91 mg/g RSP extract). Sinapine together with the phenolics at the concentration present in the RSP extract, exhibited >= 50% activity relative to the extract in antioxidant assays. Furthermore, sinapine provided plasmid DNA (pBR322) protection, from 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride and inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity by 85%. Molecular docking was utilised to explain the inhibitory activity. RSP can be an excellent source of bioactive compounds for pharmaceuticals, food additive and nutraceutical applications.

AB Zein has the potential application of establishing the delivery systems for flavonoids. But there are few reports about the effect of the molecular structures of flavonoids on their interaction with zein. In this study, the binding behaviour of 21 flavonoids and zein was investigated by spectrofluorimetry. The corresponding 3D-QSAR model was also established by Topomer CoMFA method, whose steric and electrostatic field analysis could explain the binding performance of the tested flavonoids with zein. The fluorescence analysis suggested that the flavonoids could interact with zein by forming the complex at the molar ratio of 1. The flavonoids with glucosyl groups at ring A exhibited the outstanding binding capacity with zein, and their binding process with zein was driven by hydrophobic force. The synchronous and 3D fluorescence spectra showed that there was no apparent change in the microenvironment surrounding the tyrosine residues of zein during the interaction.

AB European law requires a designation of origin for virgin and extra virgin olive oils (at least in terms of EU/nonEU provenance). Stable isotope ratios have been successfully applied to determine the geographical origin of olive oils, but never to distinguish EU and non-EU oils. In this study H-2/H-1, C-13/C-12 and O-18/O-16 ratios were analysed in bulk olive oils using Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS) as well as C-13/C-12 and H-2/H-1 in the four main fatty acids (linoleic, oleic, palmitic and stearic acids) using IRMS coupled with GC. The isotopic composition of olive oils was successfully used to distinguish samples originating in the two areas. Specifically, when bulk data were combined with fatty acid isotopic data the differentiation power of the method improved clearly. This separation is due to the specific isotopic fingerprint of the individual countries making up the EU and non-EU samples.

AB Rapid deterioration of postharvest Agaricus bisporus is a serious problem. Measures to improve the shelf-life are of great importance. Therefore, we used a nanocomposite-based packaging material (Nano-PM) containing nano-TiO2, nano-SiO2, nano-Ag and attapulgite to study its effect on microstructure and energy metabolism of A. bisporus. Nano-PM reduced the oxidation of lipids and proteins by activating antioxidant enzyme activities and inhibiting the accumulation of ROS, thereby maintained high level of energy status. Meanwhile, ATP content and energy charge of A. bisporus in Nano-PM increased through the energy metabolism system. This was attributed to the lower respiration rate and higher mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activities. These results indicated that Nano-PM could maintain the dense and intact microstructure of A. bisporus thus improve its shelf-life.

AB The ability of tannins to self-associate or form complexes with other macromolecules has important nutritional implications but can also result in defects in beverages. In addition, oxidation may be involved in the aggregation properties of tannins.
   In order to assess the impact of tannin oxidation on their self-association, oligomeric procyanidins were oxidized in a model solution and their aggregation kinetics were studied using light scattering.
   Under the conditions tested, only oxidized procyanidins were involved in haze formation. An increase in the level of oxidation and the degree of polymerization of procyanidins enhanced aggregation.
   Procyanidin oxidation products were depolymerized and the evolution of their markers was monitored throughout the aggregation process using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. This revealed the involvement of intramolecular coupling in reversible haze formation.
   The haze formed in a model solution was partially reversible at high temperature. This property was similar in pommeau, an apple-based beverage. This work highlighted the involvement of oxidized tannins in reversible haze.

AB Theileria parva kills over one million cattle annually in sub-Saharan Africa. Parasite genetic complexity, cellular response immunodominance, and bovine MHC diversity have precluded traditional vaccine development. One potential solution is gene gun (GG) immunization, which enables simultaneous administration of one or more DNA-encoded antigens. Although promising in murine, porcine, and human vaccination trials, bovine GG immunization studies are limited. We utilized the model T. parva antigen, polymorphic immunodominant molecule (PIM) to test bovine GG immunization. GG immunization using a mammalian codon optimized PIM sequence elicited significant anti-PIM antibody and cell mediated responses in 7/8 steers, but there was no difference between immunized and control animals following T. parva challenge. The results suggest immunization with PIM, as delivered here, is insufficient to protect cattle from T. parva. Nonetheless, the robust immune responses elicited against this model antigen suggest GG immunization is a promising vaccine platform for T. parva and other bovine pathogens.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the induction of mucosal immune responses by an important Brucella abortus antigen, malate dehydrogenase (Mdh), loaded in mucoadhesive chitosan nanoparticles (CNs) and immunized intranasally in a BALB/c mouse model. The production of cytokines was investigated in human leukemic monocyte cells (THP-1 cells) after stimulation with the nanoparticles. Mdh-loaded CNs (CNs-Mdh) induced higher interleukin (IL)-6 production than unloaded antigens and TF loaded CNs (CNs-TF). Using ELISpot to quantify cytokines and antibody-secreting cells in the intranasally immunized mice, IL-4 and IgG-secreting cells were found to be significantly increased at 4 weeks and 6 weeks post-immunization in the CNs-Mdh immunized group, respectively. Increases in Mdh-specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a antibodies were confirmed at 6 weeks after immunization, indicating a predominant IgG1 response. Analysis of the mucosal immune response in the intranasally immunized mice revealed, Mdh-specific IgA and total IgA in the nasal washes, genital secretions, fecal extracts and sera that were remarkably increased in the CNs-Mdh-immunized group compared to the CNs-TF-immunized group except total IgA of nasal wash. Therefore, the results indicated that the intranasal immunization of CNs-loaded B. abortus Mdh antigen effectively induced antigen-specific mucosal immune responses through the elicitation of Th2-related immune responses.

AB Exosomes are 60-150 nm small extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by most cells. Tumor-cell-derived exosomes, used as a vaccine, elicit a specific cytotoxic response against tumor cells, usually with a greater immunogenicity than tumor-cell lysates. However, the number of exosomes isolated from culture cells is limited. In recent studies, it was observed that cells respond to different stressor stimuli such as cytotoxic drugs, hypoxia, acidosis, or radiation by increasing the release of EVs.
   In this study, using the murine LBC T-cell lymphoma, we found that cyclophosphamide significantly increased EVs yield. These EVs express exosome marker proteins such as TSG-101, CD9, CD81, and CD63. Furthermore, similar humoral and cellular immune responses were induced in vivo by EVs isolated from LBC-tumor cells whether they were grown under normal culture conditions (EVs C) or in the presence of cyclophosphamide (EVs CTX). Mice vaccinated either with EVs C or EVs CTX were similarly protected against an intraperitoneal challenge with LBC tumor cells. CD4+ and CD8+ IFN-gamma secreting cells were induced in immunized mice and a specific cytotoxic cellular immune response was elicited in vitro. These results demonstrate that a Th1 response was induced by immunization with the EVs. Our findings suggest that treatment of tumor cells with cyclophosphamide is a useful method to enhance the secretion of EVs in sensitive cell lines without altering their antitumor properties and thus may be used to produce antigens for future design of cancer vaccines.

AB Background: Afghanistan remains among the three countries with endemic wild poliovirus transmission, and high population immunity levels are required to interrupt transmission and prevent outbreaks. Surveillance and vaccination of children in Afghanistan have been challenging due to security issues limiting accessibility in certain areas.
   Methods: A serosurvey was conducted in 2013 within accessible enumeration areas (EAs) among children aged <5 years using samples collected for a national micronutrient assessment survey to assess poliovirus immunity in Afghanistan. Of 21194 total EAs in Afghanistan, 107 were inaccessible and therefore were excluded from the sampling frame.
   Results: Population immunity was high overall but varied for the poliovirus serotypes, and was lowest for type 3 (95% [95% CI: 93%, 96%]) compared to type 1 (99% [95% CI:97%, 99%]) and type 2 (98% [95% CI:96%, 99%]). The proportion of the population immune to all three types was 93% (95% CI: 91%, 95%), and the proportion seronegative for all three types was 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2%, 1.7%).
   Conclusion: Except for regional differences in immunity to type 3 virus, there were no other apparent differences in seroprevalence by region or by any of the demographic or nutritional characteristics assessed in this study. The study was not powered to provide provincial level seroprevalence estimates, but Paktika Province, in the South region, had the largest proportion of seronegative specimens for type 1 (4 seronegative of 17 serum specimens compared to 14 seronegative of 673 for the remainder of the areas). Among accessible children in Afghanistan, seroprevalence of antibodies to poliovirus was high, with most seroprevalence reported at 95% or greater. Despite high seroprevalence in areas assessed in this study, the continued detection of poliovirus cases in the South and East regions indicate that overall regional vaccination coverage and performance is not sufficient to stop polio transmission.

AB We have been optimizing the design of a conjugate vaccine for nicotine addiction that employs a peptide-based hapten carrier. This peptide, which is produced by solid-phase protein synthesis, contains B cell and T cell epitope domains and eliminates the non-relevant, but highly immunogenic sequences in microbial carriers. In this report, the amino acid sequences in the T cell domain were optimized for improved vaccine activity and multivalent formulations containing structurally distinct haptens were tested for the induction of additive antibody responses. Trivalent vaccines produced antibody concentrations in mice that were 100 times greater than the amount of nicotine measured in smokers, and significantly reduced acute nicotine toxicity in rats. Two additional features were explored that distinguish the peptide from traditional recombinant carriers. The first is the minimal induction of an anti-carrier response, which can suppress nicotine vaccine activity. The second employs solid-phase synthesis to manufacture haptenated peptide. This approach obviates conventional conjugation chemistries and streamlines production of a more potent vaccine antigen. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses remain a pandemic risk to the world population. Although vaccines are the best solution to prevent this threat, a more effective vaccine for H5 strains of influenza has yet to be developed. All existing vaccines target only serum antibody against influenza as the primary outcome, while mucosal immunity has not been addressed. To address these shortcomings we have used an effective mucosal adjuvant system to produce a prototype vaccine that provides antibody, cellular and mucosal immunity to multiple serotypes of H5.
   Methods: Plant-derived recombinant H5 (rH5) antigen was mixed with a novel nanoemulsion NE01 adjuvant. The rH5-NE01 vaccine was administered intranasally to CD-1 mice and ferrets. Immunogenicity of this immunization was evaluated through rH5-specific antibody and cellular immune responses. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and virus neutralization (VN) assays were performed. Protection against H5N1 virus challenge was evaluated in ferrets.
   Results: Intranasal immunization with rH5-NE01vaccine induced high titers (>10(6)) of rH5-specific IgG in mice. In mice and ferrets this vaccine also achieved titers of >= 40 for both HI and VN. Additionally, the levels of rH5-specific IgA were significantly increased in bronchial secretions in these animals. The rH5-NE01 vaccine enhanced rH5-specific cellular immune responses including IFN-gamma and IL-17. Ten-day survival post challenge was 100% in ferrets that received rH5-NE01 compared to 12.5% in the PBS group. Furthermore, this vaccine prevented weight loss and increases in body temperature after H5N1 challenge as compared to the controls. Moreover, H5N1 virus in nasal wash of rH5-NE01-vaccinated ferrets was significantly decreased compared to controls.
   Conclusion: Intranasal immunization with rH5 antigen formulated with NE01 adjuvant elicited strong, broad and balanced immune responses that effectively protect against H5N1 influenza virus infection in the ferret model. The ease of formulation of rH5-NE01 makes this novel combination a promising mucosal vaccine candidate for pandemic influenza. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: The World Health Organization recommends annual influenza vaccination, especially in high-risk groups. Little is known about the adoption and implementation of influenza vaccination policies in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.
   Methods: A survey was distributed to country representatives at the ministries of health of the 22 countries of the Region between December 2016 and February 2017 to capture data on influenza immunization policies, recommendations, and practices in place.
   Results: Of the 20 countries that responded to the survey, 14 reported having influenza immunization policies during the 2015/2016 influenza season. All countries with an influenza immunization policy recommended vaccination for people with chronic medical conditions, healthcare workers and pilgrims. Two of the 20 countries did not target pregnant women. Eight countries used the northern hemisphere formulation, one used the southern hemisphere formulation and nine used both. Vaccination coverage was not monitored by all countries and for all target groups. Where reported, coverage of a number of target groups (healthcare workers, children) was generally low. Data on the burden of influenza and vaccine protection are scarce in the Region.
   Conclusions: Despite widespread policy recommendations on influenza vaccination, attaining high coverage rates remains a challenge in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Tackling disparities in influenza vaccine accessibility and strengthening surveillance systems may increase influenza vaccine introduction and use. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: Haemophilus influenzae type b was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in infants and children below the age of two years prior to the introduction of H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccines. In December 2011, the Indian government introduced H. influenzae b vaccine in the state of Tamilnadu. A prospective surveillance for bacterial meningitis was established at the Institute of Child Health in Chennai to evaluate the etiology of meningitis and impact of the vaccine.
   Material and Methods: Infants aged one to 23 months who were admitted to the hospital with symptoms of suspected bacterial meningitis were enrolled and lumbar puncture was performed. Cerebrospinal fluid samples were analyzed for white blood cells, protein, and glucose. Bacterial culture and a latex agglutination test for common bacterial pathogens were performed.
   Results: Between January 2009 and March 2014, 4,770 children with suspected bacterial meningitis were enrolled. Prior to the introduction of the vaccine, an average of 11.7 cases of H. influenzae b meningitis and 31.1 cases of probable meningitis with no etiology were identified each year. After introduction, the number of cases were reduced by 79% and 44% respectively. The average H. influenzae b vaccine coverage after introduction was 69% among all children with clinically suspected meningitis. In contrast, the mean number of aseptic meningitis and pneumococcal meningitis cases remained stable throughout the pre and post vaccination period; 28.2 and 4.8 per year, respectively.
   Conclusions: H. influenzae b conjugate vaccine reduced the number of cases of H. influenzae b meningitis and probable meningitis within the first two years of its introduction. The impact against meningitis was higher than the vaccination rate, indicating indirect effects of the vaccine. India has recently scaled up the use of Hib conjugate vaccine throughout the country which should substantially reduce childhood meningitis rates further in the country. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Influenza vaccine manufacturers lack tools, whatever the involved production bioprocess (egg or cell based), to precisely and accurately evaluate vaccine antigen content from samples. Indeed, the gold standard single-radial immunodiffusion (SRID) assay, which remains the only validated assay for the evaluation of influenza vaccine potency, is criticized by the scientific community and regulatory agencies since a decade for its high variability, lack of flexibility and low sensitivity. We hereby report an imaging surface plasmon resonance (SPRi) assay for the quantification of both inactivated vaccine influenza antigens and viral particles derived from egg- and cell-based production samples, respectively. The assay, based on fetuin-hemagglutinin interactions, presents higher reproducibility (<3%) and a greater analytical range (0.03-20 mu g/mL) than SRID for bulk monovalent and trivalent vaccine and its limit of detection was evaluated to be 100 times lower than the SRID's one. Finally, viral particles production through cell culture based bioprocess was also successfully monitored using our SPRi-based assay and a clear correlation was found between the biosensor response and total virus particle content.

AB Background: Both HIV positivity and African American (AA) ethnicity are associated with increased incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Poor immune response to pneumococcal polysaccharide-based vaccines may contribute to the race related increased frequency of IPD in African American HIV positive individuals.
   Methods: Caucasian and AA HIV-infected (HIV+) individuals 40-65 years old with CD4(+) T cells/mu l (CD4) >200 on antiretroviral therapy (ART) received either the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) followed by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) or PPV only. Serum IgG, IgM and opsonophagocytic antibody responses to serotypes 14 and 23F as well as serum IgG and opsonophagocytic antibody responses to serotype 19A were measured pre- and post-vaccination. We measured serum markers of inflammation in all participants and performed single cell gene expression profiling at the baseline by HD Biomark in Caucasians and African Americans.
   Results: There were no significant differences in pre-immunization inflammatory markers or post-vaccination IgG and IgM concentrations between Caucasian and African American participants. However, we found significantly lower opsonophagocytic activity in response to serotypes 14 and 19A in the AA group compared to the Caucasian group. There was no association between inflammatory markers and immune response to vaccination, however we found extensive biomodal variation in gene expression levels in single IgM+ memory B cells. Differentially expressed genes may be related to differences in the immune response between ethnic groups.
   Conclusions: Distinct racial differences were found in the functional immune response following either PPV and/or PCV/PPV immunization in HIV-positive adults, although these differences were serotype dependent. Decreased ability to respond to vaccination may in part explain racial disparities in pneumococcal disease epidemiology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The vast majority of commercially available inactivated influenza vaccines are produced from egg-grown or cell-grown live influenza virus. The first step in the production process is virus inactivation with beta-propiolactone (BPL) or formaldehyde (FA). Recommendations for production of inactivated vaccines merely define the maximal concentration for both reagents, leaving the optimization of the process to the manufacturers. We assessed the effect of inactivation with BPL and FA on 5 different influenza virus strains. The properties of the viral formulation, such as successful inactivation, preservation of hemagglutinin (HA) binding ability, fusion capacity and the potential to stimulate a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) reporter cell line were then assessed and compared to the properties of the untreated virus. Inactivation with BPL resulted in undetectable infectivity levels, while FA-treated virus retained very low infectious titers. Hemagglutination and fusion ability were highly affected by those treatments that conferred higher inactivation, with BPL-treated virus binding and fusing at a lower degree compared to FA-inactivated samples. On the other hand, BPL-inactivated virus induced higher levels of activation of TLR7 than FA-inactivated virus. The alterations caused by BPL or FA treatments were virus strain dependent. This data shows that the inactivation procedures should be tailored on the virus strain, and that many other elements beside the concentration of the inactivating agent, such as incubation time and temperature, buffer and virus concentration, have to be defined to achieve a functional product.

AB Background: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous) Australians have high rates of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), with repeat doses of 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (PPV23) recommended. We report the relative effectiveness of revaccination using a cohort from linked administrative data.
   Methods: All resident North Queensland Indigenous adults who received any PPV23 vaccination between 2000 and 2012 were identified and linked with IPD cases. IPD rates were compared for individuals revaccinated >five years after initial PPV23 dose against individuals not revaccinated.
   Results: Analysed data included 12,809 individuals and 89,612 person-years. Revaccinated adults had similar rates of IPD as non-revaccinated adults, after adjusting for potential confounders (HR = 0.92; 95%CI: 0.35-2.42). Findings were similar for vaccine-specific serotypes (HR = 1.32; 95%CI: 0.32-5.43).
   Conclusions: Benefits of PPV23 revaccination against IPD in this high-risk population were not demonstrated, although estimates were imprecise. Findings should be validated in other high-risk cohorts, and against all-cause pneumonia as an outcome. Crown Copyright (C) 2019. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rift Valley fever (RVF) causes serious health and economic losses to the livestock industry as well as a significant cause of human disease. The prevention of RVF in Africa is a global priority, however, available vaccines have only been partially effective. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a live, attenuated recombinant RVFV arMP-12 Delta NSm21/384 nucleotide deletion vaccine candidate in domestic ruminants. Evaluation involved testing to determine the infectivity titer of the vaccine virus in Vero cells for industrial scale up vaccine production. Safety experiments were conducted to determine the potential of the vaccine virus to revert to virulence by serial passages in sheep, the possibility of virus spread from vaccinated sheep and calves to unvaccinated animals, and the potential health effects of administering overdoses of the vaccine to sheep, goats and calves. The immunogenicity of 3 doses of 10(4), 10(5) and 10(6) Tissue Culture Infectious Doses(50%) (TCID50) of the vaccine was assessed in 3 groups of 10 sheep and 3 groups of 10 goats, and doses of 10(5), 10(6) and 10(7) TCID50 was evaluated in 3 groups of 10 calves subcutaenous vaccintation. The results showed that the infectivity titer of the vaccine virus was 10(8.4) TCID50/ml, that the vaccine did not spread from vaccinated to un-vaccinated animals, there was no evidence of reversion to virulence in sheep and the vaccine overdoses did not cause any adverse effects. The immunogenicity among sheep, goats and calves indicated that doses of 10(4)-10(6) TCID50 elicited detectable antibody by day 7 post-vaccination (PV) with antibody titers ranging from 0.6 log to 2.1 log on day 14 PV with sustained titers through day 28 PV. Overall, these findings indicated that the RVFV arMP-12 Delta NSm21/384 vaccine is a promising candidate for the prevention of RVF among domestic ruminants. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: The quadrivalent (q) human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine protects against infection and disease related to HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. We report efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of qHPV vaccine in a Phase 3 study in Japanese men.
   Methods: In this randomized, double-blind trial (NCT01862874), Japanese men (aged 16-26 years) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive three doses of qHPV vaccine or placebo (Day 1, Month 2, Month 6). The primary efficacy endpoint was the combined incidence of HPV6/11/16/18-related persistent anogenital infection (detected at >= 2 consecutive visits >= 6 months apart), assessed in the per-protocol population of men who received all three vaccinations, and were seronegative at Day 1 and PCR negative from Day 1 to Month 7 to the relevant HPV type. Results are from the interim and final analyses.
   Results: In total, 1124 participants were randomized. The vaccine demonstrated 83.3% (95% confidence interval: 24.9, 98.2; p = 0.007) and 85.9% (95% confidence interval: 52.7, 97.3; p < 0.001) efficacy against HPV6/11/16/18-related persistent infection in the interim and final analyses, respectively. Two cases of HPV6/11/16/18-related external genital lesions (condyloma and PIN 1) were observed in the placebo group and none in the qHPV vaccine group at study end. At Month 7, >97% of participants who received qHPV vaccine seroconverted to each of the vaccine HPV types. Most participants remained seropositive at Month 36, although the seropositivity rate declined between Months 7 and 36. Vaccination-related adverse events were reported in 60.8% and 56.5% of participants in the qHPV vaccine and placebo groups, respectively; most commonly mild to moderate injection-site pain, erythema, and swelling. Injection-site pain and swelling were more common with qHPV vaccine than placebo (each p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Results suggest qHPV vaccine is efficacious against HPV6/11/16/18-related persistent infections, immunogenic, and well-tolerated in Japanese men. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The study estimates cattle owners' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP) vaccine in Samburu county, Kenya. Of particular policy relevance, the study presents findings on WTP for i) improved access to vaccines and ii) timely access to disease-risk information. The mean price for a CBPP vaccine was estimated at KES 66 (USD 0.64). This price relates to a CBPP vaccine that requires a 1.8 h commute, cattle owners' receipt of timely information that the CBPP disease risk is low-moderate and the vaccine lowers the risk of either tail-drop or post-vaccine abortion. The conditional WTP for mean travel duration and high-risk information are similar at KES 53.9 and KES 51.5. The marginal effect on demand for a 1 h additional travel duration and provision of CBPP disease risk information was estimated as a 1.5 per cent reduction and 2.3 increase. The results of this study indicate that cattle owners value greater levels of knowledge concerning the changing risk profile of CBPP in their community and improved access to CBPP vaccination services. Enhanced engagement with cattle owners concerning CBPP would likely result in a greater utilisation of available CBPP vaccines, conditional on the perceived CBPP disease risk. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) is a severe disease of small ruminants and has high economic impacts in developing countries. Endemic in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, the disease is currently progressing with occurrences reported in North Africa, Turkey and in Georgia, and now threatens Europe. Much remains unknown about the infection dynamics, the virulence of the different strains and species/breed susceptibility. Robust experimental challenge models are needed to explore these fields and to confirm the efficacy of currently sold vaccines. We first assessed virulence of two PPR virus strains (CI89 and MA08) in Saanen goats. Whereas the MA08 strain led to classical severe clinical signs of PPR, the CI89 strain appeared to cause a mild disease in Saanen goats, highlighting the difference in virulence between strains in this animal model. We further demonstrated the importance of the inoculation route in the appearance of clinical signs and that ocular excretion is a better choice than blood for viral detection. After developing a robust challenge model, we assessed the efficacy of a vaccine (PPR-VAC (R), BVI Botswana) against the MA08 strain and demonstrated that this vaccine blocked viral excretion and significantly reduced clinical signs. These results reinforce the paradigm that a strain from one lineage could protect against strains from other lineages. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The repetitive structure of compact virus-like particles (VLPs) provides high density displays of antigenic sequences, which trigger key parts of the immune system. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines exploit the assembly competence of structural proteins, which are the effective immunogenic components of the prophylactic HBV and HPV vaccines, respectively. To optimize vaccine designs and to promote immune responses against protective epitopes, the "Asp-Ala-Asp-Pro" (NANP)-repeat from the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) was expressed within the exposed, main antigenic site of the small HBV envelope protein (HBsAgS); this differs from the RTS,S vaccine, in which CSP epitopes are fused to the N-terminus of HBsAgS. The chimeric HBsAgS proteins are assembly competent, produce VLPs, and provide a high antigenic density of the NANP repeat sequence. Chimeric VLPs with four or nine NANP-repeats (NANP4 and NANP9, respectively) were expressed in mammalian cells, the HBsAgS- and CSP-specific antigenicity of the VLPs was determined, and the immunogenicity of the VLPs assessed in relation to the induction of anti-HBsAgS and anti-CSP antibody responses. The chimeric VLPs induced high anti-CSP titres in BALB/c mice independent of the number of the NANP repeats. However, the number of NANP repeats influenced the activity of vaccine-induced antibodies measured by complement fixation to CSP, one of the proposed effector mechanisms for Plasmodium neutralization in vivo. Sera from mice immunized with VLPs containing nine NANP repeats performed better in the complement fixation assay than the group with four NANP repeats. The effect of the epitope-specific density on the antibody quality may instruct VLP platform designs to optimize immunological outcomes and vaccine efficacy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Valley Fever, or coccidioidomycosis, is caused by a soil-borne, highly virulent fungal pathogen, Coccidioides spp. Infection with Coccidioides can be life-threatening. Since an effective treatment is not available and the T cell-mediated immune response is protective, vaccine development is of interest. In this study, a primary dendritic cell (DC)-vaccine was evaluated for its ability to stimulate Coccidioides antigen-specific immune response in an extremely susceptible BALB/c mouse model. The DC-vaccine (Ag2-DC) was prepared by non-virally transfecting the primary bone marrow-derived DCs with a plasmid DNA encoding Ag2/PRA (protective epitope of Coccidioides). Mice were intranasally immunized with Ag2-DC on days 2 and 10. Immunized mice were necropsied on days 8, 32, and 44. Major organs and blood samples were harvested. The most common indicators of injury (protein, lactate, and albumin), Ag/PRA-specific cytokine-secreting cells, and IgG and its isotypes were determined by biochemical and immunologic assays, respectively. No signs of sickness were noted. Similarly, no significant changes were observed in the levels of total lung protein, lactate, and albumin, in immunized mice compared with healthy control mice. Interferon (IFN-gamma), and interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-17 cytokine-secreting cells were observed in lung and lymph nodes upon Ag2-DC immunization. Our results showed that the levels of serum IgG and its isotypes were increased in Ag2-DC-immunized mice. This report provides evidence of DC immunization-stimulated Ag2/PRA-specific immune responses. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is a severe disease mainly affecting infants and young children. The most common serogroup causing IMD in Germany is the serogroup type B Neisseria meningitidis (MenB). The aim of the present study is to estimate the economic burden of MenB-related IMD in Germany.
   Method: A bottom-up, model-based costing approach has been used to calculate the diagnose- and age-specific yearly lifetime costs of a hypothetical cohort of MenB-related IMD cases. Direct costs contain the treatment cost for the acute phase of the disease, long-term sequelae, costs for rehabilitation, and public health response. Indirect costs are calculated for the human-capital approach and the friction-cost approach considering productivity losses of patients or parents for the acute phase and long-term sequelae. Publicly available databases from the Federal Statistical Office, the SOEP panel data set, literature, and expert opinion were used as data sources. All future costs beyond the reference year of 2015 were discounted at 3%.
   Results: The total costs for the hypothetical cohort (343 patients) from a societal perspective are (sic)19.6 million ((sic)57,100/IMD case) using the friction-cost approach and (sic)58.8 million ((sic)171,000/IMD case) using the human-capital approach. Direct costs amount to (sic)18.6 million or (sic)54,300 (sic)/case. Sequelae are responsible for 81% of the direct costs/case.
   Discussion: The elevated costs/MenB-related IMD case reflect the severity of the disease. The total costs are sensitive to the productivity-loss estimation approach applied. MenB is an uncommon but severe disease; The costs/case reflect the severity of the disease and is within the same magnitude as for human papilloma virus infections. The available literature on sequelae is due to the uncommonness limited and heterogeneous. (C) 2019 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB After massive foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks originated from Jincheon County from Dec. 2014 to Apr. 2015, the effectiveness of the previous FMD vaccine containing only the O1 Manisa as the O antigen, O1 Manisa + A Malaysia 97 + Asia 1 Sharmir trivalent vaccine, was questioned in South Korea, and a change in the O antigen in FMD vaccines was demanded to control the FMD caused by FMDV O/Jincheon/ SKR/2014, the O Jincheon strain. Therefore, the efficacies of O1 Manisa + O 3039 bivalent vaccine and O 3039 monovalent vaccine were studied for cross-protection against heterologous challenge with the O Jincheon strain. In this study, the efficacy of the O1 Manisa + O 3039 bivalent vaccine was better than that of the O 3039 monovalent vaccine, even though the serological relationship (r(1) value) between O Jincheon and O 3039 was matched according to the OIE Terrestrial Manual. According to serological test results from vaccinated specific pathogen free pigs, virus neutralization test titers against Jincheon were good estimates for predicting protection against challenge. A field trial of the O1 Manisa + O 3039 bivalent vaccine was performed to estimate the possibility of field application in conventional pig farms, especially due to concerns about the effect of maternally derived antibodies (MDA) in field application of the FMD vaccine. According to the result of the field trial, the O1 Manisa + O 3039 bivalent vaccine was considered to overcome MDA. The results of the efficacy and field trials indicated that the O1 Manisa + O3039 vaccine could be suitable to replace previous FMD vaccines to control the FMD field situation caused by O Jincheon FMDV.

AB Background: The period of heightened risk of invasive meningococcal disease in adolescence extends for >10 years. This study aimed to evaluate persistence of the immune response to the serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccine MenB-FHbp (Trumenba (R), Bivalent rLP2086) under two- and three-dose primary vaccination schedules, both of which are approved in the United States and the European Union, and to assess safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose.
   Methods: This was an open-label extension study of a phase 2 randomized MenB-FHbp study (primary study). This interim analysis includes data through 1 month after booster vaccination. In the primary study, adolescents 11-18 years of age were randomized using an interactive voice or web-based response system to receive 120 mu g MenB-FHbp under 0-, 1-, 6-month; 0-, 2-, 6-month; 0-, 6-month; 0-, 2-month; or 0-, 4-month schedules (termed study groups for the current analysis). For the primary study, participants were blinded to their vaccine study group allocation, but investigators and the study sponsor were unblinded. Immune responses in subjects from the primary study were evaluated through 48 months after primary vaccination (persistence stage; 17 sites in Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, and Sweden). Safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose given at 48 months after primary vaccination (booster stage; 14 sites in Czech Republic, Denmark, and Sweden) were also assessed. Immune responses were evaluated in serum bactericidal assays with human complement (hSBAs) using four MenB test strains representative of disease-causing MenB strains in the United States and Europe and expressing factor H binding proteins (FHbps) heterologous to the vaccine antigens. The primary immunogenicity endpoints were the proportions of subjects with hSBA titers greater than or equal to the assays' lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ: 1:8 or 1:16 depending on strain) at 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months after primary vaccination (persistence stage) and 1 and 48 months after the primary vaccination series and 1 month after receipt of the booster dose (booster stage). Safety evaluations during the booster stage included local reactions and systemic events by severity, antipyretic use, adverse events (AEs), immediate AEs, serious AEs (SAES), medically attended AEs (MAEs), newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions (NDCMCs), and missed days of school and work because of AEs. The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population was used for immunogenicity evaluations in the persistence stage. The booster stage immunogenicity evaluations used the evaluable immunogenicity population; analyses were also performed in the mITT population. For the persistence stage, safety evaluations included subjects with at least one blood draw, whereas for the booster stage, they included subjects who received the booster dose and had available safety data. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01543087.
   Findings: A total of 465 subjects were enrolled in the persistence stage, and 271 subjects were enrolled in the booster stage. Sera for the extension phase of this interim analysis were collected from September 7,2012 to December 7, 2015. One month after primary vaccination, 73.8-100.0% of subjects depending on study group responded with hSBA titers >= LLOQ Response rates declined during the 12 months after last primary vaccination and then remained stable through 48 months, with 18.0-61.3% of subjects depending on study group having hSBA titers >= LLOQ at this time point. One month after receipt of the booster dose, 91.9-100.0% of subjects depending on study group had hSBA titers >= LLOQ against the four primary strains individually and 91.8-98.2% had hSBA titers >= LLOQ against all four strains combined (composite response). Geometric mean titers were higher after booster vaccination than at 1 month after primary vaccination. Immune responses were generally similar across study groups, regardless of whether a two- or three-dose primary series was received. None of the AEs (2.2-6.9% of subjects depending on study group) or NDCMCs (1.8-5.0%) that were reported during the persistence stage were considered related to the investigational product. Local reactions and systemic events were reported by 84.4-93.8% and 68.876.6% of subjects depending on study group, respectively, in the booster stage; these were generally similar across study groups, transient, and less frequent than after any primary vaccination. Additionally, there was no general progressive worsening in severity of reactogenicity events (ie, potentiation; <= 3 subjects per group), and reactogenicity events did not lead to any study withdrawals. No NDCMCs or immediate AEs were reported during the booster stage. AEs were reported by 3.7-12.5% of subjects depending on study group during the booster stage. The two possibly related AEs included a mild worsening of psoriasis and a severe influenza-like illness that resolved in 10 days.
   Interpretation: Immune responses declined after the primary vaccination series; however, a substantially greater number of subjects retained protective responses at 48 months after primary vaccination compared with subjects having protective responses before vaccination. Persistence trends were similar across all 5 study groups regardless of whether a two- or three-dose primary schedule was received. Furthermore, a booster dose given 48 months after primary vaccination was safe, well-tolerated, and elicited robust immune responses indicative of immunologic memory; these responses were similar between two- and three-dose primary schedule study groups. Use of a booster dose may help further extend protection against MenB disease in adolescents. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Bacterial beta-etherases and glutathione lyases are glutathione-dependent enzymes that catalyze the selective cleavage of beta-O-4 aryl ether bonds found in lignin. Their glutathione (GSH) dependence is regarded as major limitation for their application in the production of aromatics from lignin polymer and oligomers, as stoichiometric glutathione amounts are required. Thus, recycling of the GSH cofactor by a NAD(P)H-dependent glutathione reductase was proposed previously. Herein, the use of a whole-cell catalyst was studied for efficient beta-O-4 aryl ether bond cleavage with intracellular GSH supply and recycling. After optimization of the whole-cell catalyst as well as reaction conditions, up to 5mM lignin model substrate 2,6-methoxyphenoxy-alpha-vera-trylglycerone (2,6-MP-VG) were efficiently converted into 2,6-methoxyphenol (2,6-MP) and veratryl glycerone (VG) without addition of external GSH. Unexpectedly, no glucose supply was required for glutathione recycling within the cells up to this substrate concentration. To demonstrate the applicability of this whole-cell approach, a whole-cell cascade combining a stereoselective beta-etherase (either LigE from Sphingobium sp. SYK-6 or LigF-NA from Novosphingobium aromaticivorans) and a glutathione lyase (LigG-TD from Thiobacillus denitrificans) was employed in the kinetic resolution of racemic 2,6-MP-VG. This way, enantiopure (S)- and (R)-2,6-MP-VG were obtained on semi-preparative scale without the need for external GSH supply.

AB Amine transaminases are a class of efficient and industrially-desired biocatalysts for the production of chiral amines. In this study, stabilized variants of the (R)-selective amine transaminase from Aspergillus terreus (ATATA) were constructed by consensus mutagenesis. Using Consensus Finder (http://cbs-kazlab.oit.umn.edu/), six positions with the most prevalent amino acid (over 60% threshold) among the homologous family members were identified. Subsequently, these six residues were individually mutated to match the consensus sequence (I77 L, Q97E, H210N, N245D, G292D, and I295 V) using site-directed mutagenesis. Compared to that of the wildtype, the thermostability of all six single variants was improved. The H210N variant displayed the largest shift in thermostability, with a 3.3-fold increase in half-life (t(1/2)) at 40 degrees C, and a 4.6 degrees C increase in T-50(10) among the single variants. In addition, the double mutant H210N/I77L displayed an even larger shift with 6.1-fold improvement of t(1/2) at 40 degrees C, and a 6.6 degrees C increase in T-50(10). Furtherly, the H210N/I77L mutation was introduced into the previously engineered thermostable AT-ATA by the introduction of disulfide bonds, employing B-factor and folding free energy (Delta Delta G(fold)) calculations. Our results showed that the combined variant H210N/I77L/M150C-M280C had the largest shift in thermostability, with a 16.6-fold improvement of t(1/2) and a 11.8 degrees C higher T-50(10).

AB Vaccination is as one of the most beneficial biopharmaceutical interventions against pathogens due to its ability to induce adaptive immunity through targeted activation of the immune system. Each vaccine needs a tailor-made set of tests in order to monitor its quality throughout the development and manufacturing. The analysis of the conformational state of protein nanoparticles is one of the key steps in vaccine quality control. The enzyme lumazine synthase from Brucella spp. (BLS) acts as a potent oral and systemic immunogen. BLS has been used as a carrier of foreign peptides, protein domains and whole proteins, serving as a versatile platform for vaccine engineering purposes. Here, we show the generation and characterization of four families of nanobodies (Nbs) which only recognize BLS in its native conformational state and that bind to its active site. The present results support the use of conformation-sensitive Nbs as molecular probes during the development and production of vaccines based on the BLS platform. Finally, we propose Nbs as useful molecular tools targeting other protein scaffolds with potential applications in nano-and biotechnology.

AB Deep eutectic solvents (DES) are a class of neoteric solvents used in multiple applications amongst which biocatalytic processes. Due to its simple preparation, low cost and inherent biodegradable properties, its use as a non-volatile biocompatible co-solvent with both whole cells and isolated enzymes has displayed increased enzyme activity and stability translating to higher product conversions and a surprising higher enantioselectivity in a range of biotransformations. This review lays out the latest updates on the use of DES in redox biocatalytic reactions. With that purpose, a clear division has been made to summarize the application of DES in bioreduction reactions using whole cells and purified alcohol dehydrogenases, oxidations involving alcohol dehydrogenases, heme-dependent enzymes, peroxidases, laccases and catalases, ozonolysis reactions, and finally mention the application of lipase in the mediation of chemoenzymatic epoxidation and Baeyer-Villiger reactions.

AB Halophilic and freshwater strains of cyanobacteria representing the Oscillatoriales, Nostocales, Chroococcales, and Synechococcales orders of Cyanophyta were examined to determine (i) the resistance of their cultures when suppressed by the presence of exogenous methoxylated and methylated derivatives of 2'-hydroxychalcone, (ii) morphological changes in cells treated with the tested chalcones and, most importantly, (iii) whether these photoautotrophic microorganisms transform chalcone derivatives in a structure-or strain-dependent manner. The growth of cyanobacterial cultures depended on chalcone derivatives and the strain; nevertheless, trends for correlations between these parameters are difficult to determine. The exposure of cyanobacteria to the tested chalcones revealed severe membrane damage that was consistent with the disruption of membrane integrity. All examined blue-green algae transformed methoxy derivatives of 2'-hydroxychalcone via hydrogenative bio-reduction and formed the corresponding hydroxydihydro derivatives with various efficiencies (<= 1 - 70%), depending more on the structure than on the strain. We observed dependency of the routes and efficiency of biohydrogenation of tested chalcones on the location of the methoxyl substituent and, to a lesser extent, on cyanobacterial strains. 2'-hydroxy-4 ''-methylchalcone was also converted by cyanobacteria to various products, amongst which the most interesting were 2'-ethoxy derivatives. The final products of biocatalytic transformation were extracted from the cyanobacterial media, separated by high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) and identified by a combination of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS technique) and one-dimensional (1D H-1 and C-13) and two-dimensional (2D HSQC and COSY) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.

AB An Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655-derived strain was engineered for respiro-fermentative production of pyruvate from glucose under anoxic conditions, which is preferred for industrial-scale microbial synthesis of valuable chemicals. The pathways of anaerobic pyruvate dissimilation were blocked in the strain by the deletion of the ackA, pta, poxB, ldhA, adhE, and pflB genes. The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system of glucose transport and phosphorylation was substituted by an alternative ATP-dependent system resulting from the overexpression of galP and glk upon deletion of ptsG. The channelling of pyruvate towards the oxidative branch of the TCA cycle under respiratory conditions was prevented in the strain due to the deletion of aceEF genes, encoding components of pyruvate dehydrogenase, while the operation of the entire reductive branch of the TCA cycle was interrupted by knocking out frdAB and sdhAB. Reoxidation of glycolytic NADH was ensured via anaerobic respiration with nitrate serving as an external electron acceptor. To enforce anaerobic ATP hydrolysis, an ATP-consuming futile cycle of pyruvate-oxaloacetate-malate-pyruvate was established in the strain by expressing the Bacillus subtilis pycA gene, encoding pyruvate carboxylase. In the presence of sufficient amounts of an external electron acceptor and CO2 source, the engineered strain was able to efficiently utilise glucose and convert it to pyruvate anaerobically with a yield of 1.73 mol/mol, amounting to 87% of the theoretical maximum. The implemented strategy offers the potential for the development of highly efficient processes of bio-based pyruvate production.

AB N-Alkylated-alpha-amino acids are useful building blocks for the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. Enantioselective methods of N-alkylated-alpha-amino acid synthesis are therefore highly valuable and widely investigated. While there are a variety of chemical methods for their synthesis, they often employ stoichiometric quantities of hazardous reagents such as pyrophoric metal hydrides or genotoxic alkylating agents, whereas biocatalytic routes can provide a greener and cleaner alternative to existing methods. This review highlights the occurrence of the N-alkyl-alpha-amino acid motif and its role in nature, important applications towards human health and biocatalytic methods of preparation. Several enzyme classes that can be used to access chiral N-alkylated-alpha-amino acids and their substrate selectivities are detailed.

AB Enzymatic degradation of urea, the precursor of carcinogenic compound ethylcarbamate in rice wine, is always attractive. In the present study, we achieved high efficient production of Bacillus paralicheniformis iron-containing urease (Bp_Urease) in B. subtilis with the food-grade expression system. After reassembly of the urease gene cluster with inserting ribosome binding site (RBS), the production was increased from 38 U/L to 187 U/L. After altering the position of ureC and co-expressing the iron transporter encoding gene ureH, the activity was further increased to 1307 U/L. Eventually, the urease production was improved to 21,964 U/L in 3-L fermentor, which is the highest reported value to date. Food-grade production of the iron-containing urease would be favorable to the practical applications in food industries.

AB We present a two-step process to produce dry-state Ketoprofen-loaded poly(methyl methacrylate) nanoparticles (NPs) with controllable size and tunable drug release profile. A colloidal suspension of drug-loaded nanoparticles was first obtained from a nanoprecipitation process and then transferred into a commercial spray dryer. Three micromixers of different designs and mixing principles (molecular diffusion and impact mixing) were tested. After the first step, highly monomodal NPs in the size range 100 to 210 nm were obtained as seen by the low polydispersity index value (ca. PDI similar to 0.2) returned by a dynamic light scattering detector. Physicochemical properties, encapsulation efficiency/ratio and drug release kinetics of NPs before and after drying were determined. For similar operating conditions, the best micromixer tested (impact mixing) allowed concluding that the NPs size was not significantly affected by the spray drying while encapsulation parameters and drug release rate were slightly decreased compared to the non spray-dried NPs. A sustained drug release was observed over 6 h and the drug release rate (up to 70%) was found to vary with the size of the NPs which in turn was a function of the flow rate ratio between the polymer solution and the non-solvent solution.

AB There is huge global concern surrounding the emergence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria and this is resulting in an inability to treat infectious diseases. This is due to a lack of new antimicrobials coming to the market and irresponsible use of traditional antibiotics. Bactofencin A, a novel antimicrobial peptide which shows potential as an antibiotic, is susceptible to enzyme degradation. To improve its solution stability and inherent activity, bactofencin A was loaded onto a traditional silica mesoporous matrix, SBA-15, and a periodic mesoporous or-ganosilane, MSE. The loading of bactofencin A was considerably higher onto SBA-15 than MSE due to the hydrophilic nature of SBA-15. While there was no detectable peptide released from SBA-15 into phosphate buffered saline and only 20% of the peptide loaded onto MSE was released, the loaded matrices showed enhanced activity compared to the free peptide during in vitro antimicrobial assays. In addition, the mesoporous matrices were found to protect bactofencin A against enzymatic degradation where results showed that the SBA-15 and MSE with loaded bactofencin A exposed to trypsin inhibited the growth of S. aureus while a large decrease in activity was observed for free bactofencin upon exposure to trypsin. Thus, the activity and stability of bactofencin A can be enhanced using mesoporous matrices and these matrices may enable its potential development as a novel antibiotic. This work also shows that in silico studies looking at surface functional group and size complementarily between the peptide and the protective matrix could enable the systemic selection of a mesoporous matrix for individual bacteriocins with potential antimicrobial therapeutic properties.

AB Improving freeze-drying processes regarding drying time and batch homogeneity is subject of ongoing research work. In this context, controlled nucleation raised great expectations. However, practically we face some challenges, e.g. how to non-destructively monitor successfully performed controlled nucleation. The question if different controlled nucleation methods lead to comparable products, as not every method can easily be implemented in lab and production scale equipment, is also of high interest. Additionally, the optimal nucleation temperature for controlled nucleation is an open question. In our study, we addressed these challenges. We successfully evaluated frequency modulated spectroscopy as a fast and non-destructive method to monitor controlled nucleation success and batch homogeneity. We found that the better homogeneity generated by controlled nucleation during the freezing step did not sustain in the dried product. Lyophilizates produced by three different ice fog methods for controlled nucleation were characterized by comparable specific surface areas but differed in residual moisture content. To investigate the impact of the ice nucleation temperature (T-N) on the resulting specific surface area, we performed controlled nucleation at - 3 degrees C and -10 degrees C. We concluded that T-N is not the only specific surface area determining factor and a high TN does not necessarily lead to larger pores but poses a higher risk of not-nucleating vials.

AB Recent years have witnessed a paradigm shift in the focus of healthcare towards development of customized therapies which cater to the unmet needs in a myriad of disease areas such as cancer, infections, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders and inflammatory disorders. The term 'theranostic' refers to such multifunctional systems which combine the features of diagnosis and treatment in a single platform for superior control of the disease. Theranostic systems enable detection of disease, treatment and real time monitoring of the diseased tissue. Theranostic nanocarriers endowed with multiple features of imaging, targeting, and providing on-demand delivery of therapeutic agents have been designed for enhancement of therapeutic outcomes. Fabrication of theranostics involves utilization of materials having distinct properties for imaging, targeting, and programming drug release spatially and temporally. Although the field of theranostics has been widely researched and explored so far for treatment of different types of cancer, there have been considerable efforts in the past few years to extend its scope to other areas such as infections, neurodegenerative disorders and cardiovascular diseases. This review showcases the potential applications of theranostics in disease areas other than cancer.

AB Cataract is highly prevalent among old population worldwide and replacement of the opacified crystalline lens by an intraocular lens (IOL) is the safest and the most effective treatment. Although not very frequently (0.02-0.33% of the cases), the patients who undergo cataract surgery may develop endophthalmitis, which is a serious problem eventually leading to blindness. To avoid this complication, the postoperative instillation of antibiotics and anti-inflammatories is almost universally used in clinical practice. The aim of this work was to study the possibility of loading an IOL material with an antibiotic and an anti-inflammatory, which could be simultaneously released and successfully substitute the frequent instillation of topical drops for the prevention of endophthalmitis. The IOL material commercially available under the name of CI26Y (Contamac Products) was chosen and two pairs of drugs consisting of one antibiotic and one anti-inflammatory were tested: moxifloxacin + ketorolac and moxifloxacin + diclofenac. The drug loading was done by soaking under optimized conditions. Simultaneous drug loading improved the release profiles, especially in the case of moxifloxacin + ketorolac. The effect of sterilization by steam heat (carried out on the first day of loading) and by gamma-radiation upon the release profiles was negligible. The optical and mechanical properties of the sterilized, double-loaded IOL materials were kept at adequate levels. Application of a mathematical model to predict the in vivo released concentrations suggested that the most efficient system complied with the therapeutic needs: the lens loaded with moxifloxacin + ketorolac was effective against S. aureus and S. epidermidis up to 15 days, and the amount of released ketorolac remained active against inflammation for a minimum of 16 days.

AB Carbopol (R) 971 and poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) form hydrogen-bonded interpolymer complexes in aqueous solutions and their complexation is strongly dependent on solution pH. This work investigated the complexation between these polymers in aqueous solutions. The compositions of interpolymer complexes as well as the critical pH values of complexation were determined. The structure of these complexes was studied in solutions using transmission electron microscopy and in solid state using elemental analysis, FTIR spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Solid compacts were prepared based on interpolymer complexes and physical blends of these polymers and their swelling behaviour was studied in aqueous solutions mimicking the fluids present in the gastrointestinal tract. These materials were used to prepare oral formulations of mesalazine and its release from solid matrices was studied in vitro. It was demonstrated that the complexation between Carbopol (R) 971 and poly (2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) has a profound effect on the drug release from matrix tablets.

AB Indolicidin (IL), an antimicrobial peptide, was investigated as a vehicle to promote oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) delivery. To increase charge density, IL was dimerized by adding a cysteine to its C or N terminus, which was denoted as ILC or CIL, respectively. In contrast to IL, cytotoxicity of ILC and CIL was significantly reduced because these dimeric peptides were longer than IL, which restricted their insertions to cell membrane. In contrast to ILC, CIL displayed well loading efficiency. These peptides were applied to deliver ODNs against tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) because TNF-alpha is a pro-inflammatory cytokine which plays an important role in immunological diseases. Although IL/ODN slightly reduced TNF-alpha expression, the high cytotoxicity restricted its application window. Furthermore, ILC/ODN was incapable of inducing gene silence due to its low encapsulation efficiency and poor endosomal escape. In contrast, CIL exhibited excellent ODN transportation and the internalized CIL/ODN complexes may escape from endosomes. Therefore, TNF-alpha expression can be specifically reduced by CIL/ODN complexes, and the silence effect was maintained longer than 14 h. This study provides a useful strategy of peptide vehicle design, which may facilitate the delivery of not only ODN but also other oligonucleotides, including siRNA and miRNA, to promote gene silence application.

AB Catheter-associated infections still represent a challenging thread because of the likelihood of biofilm formation. The aim of this work was the surface modification of catheters to immobilize lysozyme and acylase under mild conditions while preserving antimicrobial and anti-quorum sensing performances. Glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) was grafted onto poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) catheters by a pre-irradiation method. The effects of monomer concentration, pre-irradiation dose, reaction time, monomer concentration and reaction temperature were investigated. The grafting process was monitored using FTIR-ATR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and swelling data. Lysozyme was directly immobilized onto PVC-g-GMA maintaining the hydrolytic activity, which hindered Staphylococcus aureus adhesion. For acylase immobilization, the PVC-g-GMA catheters were reacted with ethylenediamine and glutaraldehyde in order to facilitate acylase covalent binding. Free acylase in solution demonstrated notably capability to act as quorum sensing inhibitor, as observed using Chromobacterium violaceum as biosensor, by degrading a wide variety of acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs), including those produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Acylase-immobilized PVC-g-GMA catheters were challenged against degradation of AHLs and the activity monitored using both the biosensor and HPLC-MS. Relevantly, the functionalized catheters completely degraded all tested AHL signals, opening new ways of preventing biofilm formation on medical devices.

AB Chemotherapeutics are used extensively in cancer and encapsulating the drug in nanoparticles is an effective method to enhance therapeutic efficacy and reduce side effect. In this work, DOX-loaded chitosan nanoparticles were prepared using supercritical fluid assisted atomization introduced by a hydrodynamic cavitation mixer (SAA-HCM) from aqueous solution. The influences of solution concentration, CO2/solution ratio, mixer pressure, chitosan/DOX ratio and chitosan molecular weight on particle morphologies and sizes were investigated in detail. Well defined spherical nanoparticles with average diameter ranging from 120 nm to 250 nm were obtained, and the loading efficiency was up to 90%. FT-IR result showed that the structure of DOX was not changed after the SAA-HCM process. Zeta potential of the nanoparticles was about + 50 mV. The in vitro drug release behavior conducted in the media with pH of 4.5, 6.5 and 7.4 respectively showed strongly pH responsive. In vitro cytotoxicity profiles revealed that the activity of DOX was well maintained after loaded into chitosan nanoparticles. The SAA-HCM process was demonstrated to be a promising technique for one-step production of polymer/drug composite nanoparticles suitable for cancer drug delivery from aqueous solution.

DE Twin screw granulation; Design space; Stress; Channel fill level;
   Particle size distribution; Continuous wet granulation
AB The forces experienced by the particles inside a twin screw granulator (TSG) are one of the most difficult parameters to measure quantitatively. However, it is possible to perform accurately this measurement through the use of dye containing calibrated microencapsulated sensors (LAMES) whose rupture is directly dependant on their experienced shear stress. The current study measures the extent of local stresses in the transformation from powder to granules at different channel fills during TSG processing. Channel fill has shown good potential as a design tool, however, its validity for predicting particle size distributions has yet to be demonstrated in an 11-mm TSG. The results of this study showed that the particles within the twin screw granulator experienced stresses in the range of 350-1000 kPa and this value was not linear with the specific mechanical energy applied by the granulator. It was observed that the majority of these stresses were produced by material transport processes rather than the granulation in itself. In addition it was determined that the torque required by the TSG increases exponentially after a certain channel fill a feature that requires to be considered in order to design safer, predictable and reliable granulation workspaces.

While nano-drug delivery systems present as promising strategies for INH delivery, the therapeutic efficacies are usually suboptimal due to ineffective drug accumulation at diseased sites. Local delivery system can achieve high drug concentration at focus sites with minimal systemic exposure, and herein we aimed to employ this strategy to develop a novel liposome-in-hydrogel system for localized treatment of bone TB. To achieve sustainable drug release, a derivative of INH called DINH was loaded because of its hydrophobicity, as well as its better activity and higher biosafety than INH. The hybrid system was demonstrated for thermo-responsive and self-healing properties via phase transition test and rheological studies, which were particularly useful for intra-articular administration. In vivo microdialysis studies revealed that the system can rapidly release drug into synovial fluid to reach effective inhibitory concentrations after localized injection, followed by a steady-state drug release. The optical image studies were performed to study its long-term behavior in vivo, which suggested a sustained drug release profile for several days. This work provides a promising drug delivery system for bone TB therapy.

AB Bare polycaprolactones with controlled molar mass and dispersity were employed to manufacture biodegradable devices, which were applied for doxorubicin delivery in glioblastoma. Micro- and nanoscale devices were prepared by emulsion formation or by a combination of precipitation and hydrolysis. The carriers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering techniques, thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. The encapsulation parameters and drug-release profiles are discussed in order to evaluate the influence of different fundamental parameters, such as molar mass and dispersity value, pH, morphology or crystallinity, on the efficiency of the doxorubicin delivery systems. The ability of doxorubicin-loaded micro- and nanoscale devices to induce cellular toxicity in glioblastoma cells was also explored. A cell viability assay against C6 cells of doxorubicin-loaded nanocarriers showed higher cytotoxicity than doxorubicin-loaded microcarriers. In addition, doxorubicin-loaded nanocarriers also showed good antitumor profile in human tumoral cells and improved the security profile in relation to free doxorubicin in non-tumoral cells. Consistent with the assessment study described in this manuscript, the results provide a proof of concept for the suitability of the approach, based on bare polycaprolactone, to local controlled-sustained release of doxorubicin for the treatment of glioblastoma.

AB A new, smartphone-based colourimetric method for the assay of D-penicillamine formulations relying on the Ellman's reaction was developed by performing the colourimetric reaction in a microplate. Subsequently, the plate was positioned on a white illuminating screen of an iPad placed in a dark box in order to capture a top-view image using an iPhone 5s back camera. The intensity of yellow colour was converted to Red-Green-Blue pixels using a free mobile application. Under the optimal conditions for the reaction and photography, the intensity of blue colour, which was logarithmically transformed, showed an excellent linearity over the drug concentration range of 5-40 mu g/mL. The assay was validated and successfully applied to the assay of drug content and the determination of drug amount released in the dissolution test in the capsule dosage forms. Apart from that, a smartphone was employed for the colour measurement as an alternative to a spectrophotometer in the currently used method for the quantitation of free sulfhydryl groups in polymers. Using cysteine-conjugated chitosan as a sample and L-cysteine as a standard, the smartphone method gave the results in agreement with those obtained from the absorbance measurement on a microplate reader. In conclusion, smartphone-based colourimetry has been proved to be a reliable, fast, simple and affordable alternative means for the analysis of D-penicillamine and cysteine-conjugated polymer and can be potentially applied to other thiol-containing drugs and excipients.

AB In pharmaceutical technology, lipids and polymers are considered pillar excipients for the fabrication of most dosage forms, irrespective of the administration route. They play various roles ranging from support vehicles to release rate modifiers, stabilizers, solubilizers, permeation enhancers and transfection agents. Focusing on selected applications, which were discussed at the Annual Scientific Meeting of the Gattefosse Foundation 2018, this manuscript recapitulates the fundamental roles of these two important classes of excipients, either employed alone or in combination, and provides insight on their functional properties in various types of drug formulations. Emphasis is placed on oral formulations for the administration of active pharmaceutical ingredients with low aqueous solubilities or poor permeation properties. Additionally, this review article covers the use of lipids and polymers in the design of colloidal injectable delivery systems, and as substrates in additive manufacturing technologies for the production of tailor-made dosage forms.

AB The development of novel antibiotic systems is needed to address the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. The aim of the study was to explore the novel nanoplex delivery method for vancomycin (VCM) against MRSA using dextran sulfate sodium salt (DXT) as a polyelectrolyte complexing agent. Nanoplexes were formulated by the self-assembling amphiphile polyelectrolyte complexation method and characterized. The size, polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta potential (ZP) of the optimized VCM nanoplexes were 84.6 +/- 4.248 nm, 0.449 +/- 0.024 and - 33.0 +/- 4.87 mV respectively, with 90.4 +/- 0.77% complexation efficiency (CE %) and 62.3 +/- 0.23% drug loading. The in vitro (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenylte-trazolium bromide)tetrazolium (MTT) studies of the nanoplexes were found to be non-toxic against different mammalian cell lines tested and may confirm its biosafety. While the in vitro drug release studies demonstrated sustained slower release. The in silico study confirmed the spontaneous interaction of VCM with DXT in the presence of sodium chloride. A 6.24-fold enhancement was observed for VCM nanoplexes via in vitro anti-bacterial studies. Flow-cytometric analysis showed effective cell killing of 67% from VCM nanoplexes compared to 32.98% from the bare vancomycin at the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1.25 mu g/mL. The in vivo studies using BALB/c mouse skin infection model revealed that nanoplexes reduced MRSA burden by 2.3-folds compared to bare VCM. The novel nanoplexes have potential to be a promising delivery system to combat MRSA infections for improved treatment of bacterial infections.

AB Remarkable efforts are currently devoted to the area of nanodiamonds (NDs) research due to their superior properties viz: biocompatibility, minute size, inert core, and tunable surface chemistry. The use of NDs for the delivery of anticancer drugs has been at the forefront of NDs applications owing to their ability to increase chemosensitivity, sustain drug release, and minimize drug side effects. Accelerated steps towards the move of NDs from bench side to bedside have been recently witnessed. In this review, the effects of NDs production and purification techniques on NDs' final properties are discussed. Special concern is given to studies focusing on NDs use for anticancer drug delivery, stability enhancement and mediated targeted delivery. The aim of this review is to put the results of studies oriented towards NDs-mediated anticancer drug delivery side by side such that the reader can assess the potential use of NDs in clinics and follow up the upcoming results of clinical testing of NDs on animals and humans.

AB The complete loss of dermal tissue due to ischemia is a serious challenge facing clinicians. Frequently, the failure of wound healing is due to ischemic conditions prevailing at the site of damaged tissue. Restoration of lost vasculature at the ischemic site can be achieved by supplementing proangiogenic stimuli through an engineered scaffold mimicking dermal extracellular matrix. Towards this objective, we have developed an electrospun scaffold loaded with the pro-angiogenic molecule resveratrol. The physical and chemical changes in the polymeric scaffold before and after loading of resveratrol were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), coherence scanning interferometry (CSI) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). A sustained release of resveratrol from the scaffold was elucidated by UV-spectrophotometer analysis. The enhancement in cell-matrix interaction was studied using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) seeded on the scaffolds. The biocompatibility analysis of resveratrol loaded scaffolds was evaluated through a subcutaneous implantation study in mice. The therapeutic potential of resveratrol loaded scaffolds to accelerate tissue repair was analyzed in a full-thickness ischemic wound model in mice. Wound closure and H&E staining analysis showed rapid closure of ischemic wound area and re-epithelialization in resveratrol loaded scaffold treated groups compared to collagen and negative control groups. The immunostaining analysis further revealed the activation of thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mediated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in resveratrol loaded scaffold treated group. The expression of Bcl-2 in healing wound edges post-treatment with resveratrol loaded scaffold confirmed the anti-apoptotic effect mediated by resveratrol. From this study, we explored a synergistic effect mediated by resveratrol and fibrous scaffolds to aid the ischemic wound healing process through effective vascularization.

AB To overstep the dilemma of chemical drug degradation within powerful lysosomes of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), a sialic acid-polyethylenimine-cholesterol (SA-PEI-CH) modified liposomal doxorubicin (DOX-SPCL) was designed with both TAMs targeting and smart lysosomal trafficking. The modified liposome DOX-SPCL performed particle size as 103.2 +/- 3.1 nm and zeta potential as - 4.5 +/- 0.9 mV with encapsulation efficiency as 95.8 +/- 0.5%. In in vitro cell experiments, compared with conventional liposomal doxorubicin (DOX-CL) and PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (DOX-PL), DOX-SPCL showed a selective binding on TAMs and a mere lysosomal concentration. In pharmacokinetic study, DOX-SPCL effectively impeded/delayed the disposition of mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) with a value of AUC(0-t) as 796.03 +/- 66.93 mg L-1 h. In S180 sarcomas bearing mice, DOX-SPCL showed the greatest tumor inhibition rate (92.7% +/- 3.6%) compared with DOX-CL (46.4% +/- 2.0%) or DOX-PL (58.8% +/- 7.6%). The < 0.5% positive region of TAMs in tumor section indicated a super TAMs exhaustion for DOX-SPCL treatment. Conclusively, DOX-SPCL was supposed as a safe and effective liposomal preparation for clinical sarcoma treatment via TAMs targeting/deletion delivery strategy.

AB Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) affecting the colon and ileum in particular. Increasing IBD prevalence worldwide is alarming, and needs to be resolved. Due to the limited therapeutic efficacy, accompanying adverse effects, dependence, and pharmacokinetics issues of the available therapy, IBD patients have compromised quality of life. Meanwhile, conventional drug delivery systems (DDS) for IBD face many obstacles en-route to the colon, such as physiological and pathophysiological barriers, genetic variability, disease severity, and nutrition status. Therefore, the pH-dependent nanocarrier DDS is a recent advancement that fulfills the need for a more tolerable and effective remedy for IBD. It facilitates localized and targeted action, eliminating systemic adverse effects and unnecessary flushing of the drug from the inflamed colon tissues. The integration of a pH-sensitive polymer as a nanocarrier provides protection in drug transport to the lower region of the GIT. In this review, we will briefly explain IBD pathophysiology, the pros and cons of pH-dependent conventional DDS, and highlight a novel pH-dependent nanocarrier system for treating the disease.

AB A novel amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) of poorly water-soluble nobiletin (Nob) with highly water-soluble methyl hesperidin (MeHes) was developed. Mixtures of Nob and excipients (MeHes, cellulose derivatives, and synthetic polymers) were processed by hot-melt extrusion (HME). Powder X-ray diffraction analysis proved that most of the HME products were fully amorphized. In dissolution studies, Nob-MeHes ASD showed a prominently higher Nob concentration than other HME products with polymeric excipients. Nob concentration upon dissolution of Nob-MeHes ASD was 400 and 7.5 times higher than that upon dissolution of crystalline Nob and a Nob-MeHes physical mixture, respectively. In addition, Nob-MeHes ASD showed good preservation stability for 6 months under an accelerated condition of 40 degrees C and 80% relative humidity. Permeation studies using a Caco-2 cell monolayer showed that Nob-MeHes ASD markedly increased the amount of Nob transported. In mice, the plasma Nob concentration and accumulated amount of Nob in various tissues drastically increased after administration of Nob-MeHes ASD. This is the first successful application of MeHes, with a relatively low glass-transition temperature, as an excipient for an ASD formulation prepared by hot-melt extrusion. The drastic improvement in Nob concentration with a small-molecule excipient may be an important finding.

AB Postoperative pain is a common form of acute pain that has been treated commonly by local anesthetics through regional nerve blocking. In this study, a series of experiments were conducted using rats to investigate the pharmacokinetic, distribution, and efficacy of a temperature responsive hydrogel-based drug delivery device (PF-72) containing ropivacaine (0.75%) for extended relief of postoperative pain by allowing the prolonged release of ropivacaine. When the ropivacaine was administered using PF-72, its concentration-time curve (AUC(last)) and peak concentration (C-max) were 577.0 h*ng/mL and 271.9 ng/mL, respectively. In contrast when the ropivacaine solution was administered using saline solution, its AUC(last) and C-max were 982.8 h*ng/mL and 423.6 ng/mL, respectively. In the tissue distribution study, the peak concentration and mean area under the curve of the ropivacaine in injection area (target tissue) were found about 2-fold higher in the case of PF-72 compared with the case of conventional ropivacaine solution. These results clearly demonstrate the capability of PF-72 hydrogel to retain the ropivacaine at the injection site for an extended period. Effective extended (at least 24 h) pain relief of ropivacaine administered using PF-72 was found in the pharmacodynamic study of prolonged analgesic effect. The results of this study indicated that local drug delivery by PF-72 hydrogel formulation may be an effective method to achieve extended relief of pain. Other advantages of ropivacaine administration using PF-72 include reduced systemic side effects and high localization of a drug in target tissues.

AB Resistance to anti-Tuberculosis (anti-TB) drugs is primarily due to unique intrinsic resistance mechanisms that mycobacterium possess. The most important determinant of resistance is a peculiar hydrophobic and multilayered mycobacterial cell-wall structure with mycolic-acid and wax-D, which restricts permeability of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs into bacteria. In this study, it was supposed that Host Defense peptides (HDP) which are known to permeabilize bacterial membranes may, therefore, help anti-TB antibiotics to target internal sites in bacteria. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of suboptimal concentration (10 mu g/ml) of selected microencapsulated-HDP (Ub2-MS, K4-MS, and Aurein1.2-MS) with a standard anti-TB drug (Isoniazid, INH, 3 mu g/ml). We also examined the combined effect of different concentrations of HDP-MS with a suboptimal concentration of anti-TB drug (INH, 1.5 mu g/ml) which showed additive efficacy. A number of cationic HDP were encapsulated in inhalable microspheres (HDP-MS) and characterized for physicochemical and aerodynamic properties. These peptides were further evaluated for molecular mass by MALDI-TOF and random coil in its secondary structure as determined by circular dichroism. The anti-mycobacterial kinetics of selected HDP-MS (Ub2-MS, K4-MS, and Aureinl.2-MS) was evaluated against virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), both alone and in conjunction with anti-TB drug (INH). HDP-MS exhibited up to similar to 3.02 and similar to 3.41-log decrease in CFU as compared to blank-MS (drug free) and untreated control group in 96 h. The combination of HDP-MS with a suboptimal concentration of INH (1.5 mu g/ml) showed superior antibiotic activity against Mtb. Our findings show that the enhanced efficacy is due to augmentation of membrane permeation by HDP which expedited the entry of TB drug into apparently the impermeant mycobacterial membrane which further enhances the effective efficacy of the drug. This phenomenon can reduce the need for high dosages and represents a novel paradigm for potential clinical applications.

AB One of the most difficult challenges in developing nanocrystal formulations is to determine the dissolution behavior of nanocrystal suspensions (nanosuspensions), which occurs within seconds. Mefenamic acid (MFA) is a poorly soluble drug thought to limit the dissolution rate for membrane permeation. In this study, in-situ dissolution-permeation studies of a nanosuspension of mefenamic acid (MFA) were carried out using second-derivative UV spectroscopy. This method enabled us to distinguish between the concentrations of dissolved MFA and nano-suspended MFA via in-situ measurement and showed an improved dissolution rate of the nanosuspension compared to that of the microsuspension. The dissolution-permeation study with second-derivative UV spectroscopy revealed that the improved dissolution rate due to nanosized MFA resulted in an increase in the permeated amount of MFA. In addition, the solubility of MFA determined by HPLC after filtration with a 0.02-mu m filter indicated that enhanced solubility due to nanosizing also improves the permeability of MFA. Therefore, we concluded that the solubility and dissolution rate enhancements attained by nanosizing would be key factors in increasing membrane transportation of MFA. These novel in-situ dissolution-permeation studies using second-derivative UV spectroscopy offer considerable promise for developing and characterizing nanocrystal formulations.

AB Recently, promising strategies of plexes include the complexation of nucleic acids with lipids (lipoplexes) and different kinds of polymers (polyplexes) for delivery of actives and genetic material in abnormal conditions like cancer, cystic fibrosis and genetic disorders. The present review article focuses on the comparative aspects of lipoplexes and polyplexes associated with molecular structure, cellular transportation and formulation aspects. The major advantages of lipoplexes and polyplexes over conventional liposomes involve non-immunogenic viral gene transfer, facile manufacturing and preservation of genetic material encapsulated within the nanocarriers. Lipoplexes and polyplexes enhance the transfection of DNA into the cell by stepwise electrostatic cationic-anionic interaction with DNA backbones. The ease and cost-effective formation of complexes extend their applications in the treatment of cancer and genetic disorders. Lipoplexes and polyplexes necessitate intensive research in the fields of quality, toxicity and methods of preparation for commercialization.

AB Crystalline nanodispersions of naproxen stabilized with hydroxypropyl cellulose were prepared at different pHs both below and above the pK(a) of the drug. After spray drying together with lactose, the measured particle size of the rehydrated dispersions using laser light scattering/Mie analysis was found to depend strongly on the pH of the original, processed nanodispersion. The pH-dependent solubility of this weak acid resulted in formation of a dissolved fraction of drug in the nanodispersions, this being higher as the pH increases. There was therefore a loss of crystalline naproxen during processing at higher pH, with fewer and/or smaller nanoparticles in the nanodispersion after nanomilling. After spray drying, the dissolved naproxen fraction formed an amorphous solid, as shown by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray powder diffraction. The amorphous fraction redissolves on re-hydration. An improved disaggregation and smaller particle size of the nanoparticles at higher pH was observed because of the lower amount of crystalline nanoparticles now present. If the pH of the nanodispersion during processing is kept below the pK(a) for a weak acid, then a high yield of nanoparticles should be expected with little formation of an amorphous phase of the drug.

AB Currently, chemotherapy is the most common treatment for oncological diseases. Systemic administration of chemotherapeutics provides an easy and effective distribution of the active agents throughout the patient's body, however organs may be severely impaired by serious life-threatening side effects. In many oncological diseases, particularly solid tumors, the local application of chemotherapeutics would be advantageous. Recently, nanofibrous materials as local drug delivery systems have attracted much attention. They have considerable potential in the treatment of various cancers as they can provide a high concentration of the drug at the target site for a prolonged time, thereby lowering total exposure and adverse effects.
   The present review describes the specifics of drug delivery to the tumor microenvironment, basic characteristics of nanofibrous materials and their preparation, and comprehensively summarizes recent scientific reports concerning in vivo experiments with drug-loaded electrospun nanofibrous systems designed for local anticancer therapy.

AB Commercially available cilostazol (CIL) tablet releases drug immediately and is given twice a day as an antiplatelet and vasodilatory agent. However, clinical usefulness of immediate release (IR) preparation is limited due to its extremely poor water solubility and the difficulty in sustaining the blood concentration, resulting in unwanted side effects such as headaches, pyknocardia and heavy-headed symptoms. To achieve once a day dosage form with enhanced solubility and controlled release, double controlled release CIL matrix tablets (DCRT) were designed by modulating a sol-gel process of binary polymeric blends of a pH-independent hydro-xylpropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) and a pH-dependent polymer (carbomer) assisted with anionic surfactant (sodium lauryl sulfate, SLS). The release profiles of the DCRT were varied according to the ratio of the two polymers. This DCRT enhanced dissolution rate of CIL in a controlled manner due to the sol-gel and erosion process of HPMC, and SLS-driven modulation of charged carbomer via neutralization and micellar interaction. The near-infrared (NIR) chemical imaging and gravimetric behaviors of DCRT clearly showed dynamic modulation of CIL during the swelling and hydration process. Furthermore, the plasma concentration of CIL in DCRT was highly improved and sustained in beagle dogs in a controlled manner.

AB Poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and poly(D,C-lactide) (PLA) polymers were used successfully in the preparation of polymer shell microcapsules with mononuclear aqueous cores by the internal phase separation method. These microcapsules were prepared with varying amounts of polymer and water and loaded with fluorescein sodium as a model water soluble drug. Evaluation of drug loading and encapsulation efficiency reveals an optimum polymer to water ratio of around 1:3. Prepared PLGA and PLA microcapsules exhibit sustained drug release over 7 and 49 days, respectively. Drug release from both microcapsule types follow zero order kinetics over the first 90% release. Further tuning of release rate is found possible by preparing microcapsules with mixtures of PLGA and PLA polymers at varying ratios. These results suggest that aqueous core-PLGA and PLA microcapsules would be promising platforms for a wide range of sustained drug delivery systems for many hydrophilic drugs.

AB Microneedle patches have been widely used as transdermal transport systems because of their painless and easy application. Marked rigidity, strength, biocompatibility, and physiological stability are unique features of microneedles fabricated from ceramic materials to be used as microneedle patches. However, the conventional ceramic microneedles are typically dense structures with limited free space for biomolecule loading. A facile method is required for fabrication of biocompatible ceramic microneedles with interconnected porosity. Herein, the simple method of centrifugal casting was developed for fabrication of microporous microneedles from alumina suspensions. The slurry or resin-based alumina suspensions were casted into micromolds under centrifugal force, followed by sintering at high temperatures. The effects of particle size, solvent type, binder amount, resin content and sintering temperature on the microstructure and mechanical properties of microneedles were investigated. By optimizing the process parameters, highly porous (up to 60%) microneedles with interconnected micropores (of diameter similar to 1-1.5 mu m) were produced. The microporous microneedles were biocompatible and mechanically strong for skin penetration. The potential use of the microneedles for transdermal transportation of biomolecules was shown by fast and accurate extraction of glucose from a skin model and efficient loading and fast release of insulin under physiological conditions. The results suggested that the microporous alumina microneedles may serve as molecular transport systems in transdermal biosensing and drug delivery.

In vitro experiments were performed to investigate the cytotoxicity of these structures on the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Confocal microscopy studies revealed enhanced cellular endocytotic internalization, followed by the release of the examined combination from the lysosomes. The in vitro interaction analysis using the Chou-Talalay approach showed high synergistic activity of the examined combination. This synergistic activity enables a considerable reduction in cytostatic dosage and an increase in cancer treatment efficiency.

AB Pharmaceutical co-crystals present an opportunity to improve the solubility of conventional active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Despite advances in co-crystal screening, the rational design of even the chemically simplest co-crystals remains challenging. Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs) have previously been used as a tool to predict co-crystal formation using only the chemical structure. The aim of this study was to validate the use of HSPs as a tool to predict co-crystal formation, analyse its limitations and examine the previously set Delta delta inclusion cut-off value. A total of 109 co-formers of carbamazepine, caffeine and theophylline were used as a training set. Sixteen different descriptors were examined. An additional 72 co-formers of piroxicam and nicotinamide were used to test the methods and new cut-off values. The established cut-off value (8.18 MPa0.5) despite being similar to the previously reported value (7 MPa0.5), offered no real advantage over the previously reported value. Our results suggest the use of the modified radius (Ra) method of calculating the solubility difference, which had higher sensitivity of 90% compared to 86% for the previously reported method and cut-off value to indicate co-crystal formation as well as a lower miss and false omission rates.

AB Oral tablets are a convenient form to deliver active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and have a high level of acceptance from clinicians and patients. There is a wide range of excipients available for the fabrication of tablets thereby offering a versatile platform for the delivery of therapeutic agents to the gastrointestinal tract. However, the geometry of tablets is limited by conventional manufacturing processes. This study aimed to compare three manufacturing processes in the production of flat-faced oral tablets using the same formulation composed of a polymer blend and caffeine as a model drug: fused-filament fabrication (FFF), direct compression (DC) and injection molding (IM). Hot-melt extrusion was used to convert a powder blend into feedstock material for FFF and IM processes, while DC was performed on the powder mixture. Tablets were produced with the same dimensions and were characterized for their physical and dissolution properties. There were statistical differences in the physical properties and drug release profiles of the tablets produced by the different manufacturing processes. DC tablets displayed immediate release, IM provided sustained release over 48 h, and FFF tablets displayed both release types depending on the printing parameters. FFF continues to demonstrate high potential as a manufacturing process for the efficient production of personalized oral tablets.

AB An innovative lyophilized dry powder formulation consisting of urea-crosslinked hyaluronic acid (HA-CL) and sodium ascorbyl phosphate (SAP) - LYO HA-CL - SAP- was prepared and characterized in vitro for physicochemical and biological properties. The aim was to understand if LYO HA-CL - SAP could be used as adjuvant treatment for nasal inflammatory diseases. LYO HA-CL - SAP was suitable for nasal delivery and showed to be not toxic on human nasal septum carcinoma-derived cells (RPMI 2650 cells) at the investigated concentrations. It displayed porous, polygonal particles with unimodal, narrow size distribution, mean geometric diameter of 328.3 +/- 27.5 mu m, that is appropriate for nasal deposition with no respirable fraction and 88.7% of particles with aerodynamic diameter > 14.1 mu m. Additionally, the formulation showed wound healing ability on RPMI 2650 cells, and reduced interleukin-8 (IL-8) level in primary nasal epithelial cells pre-induced with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Transport study across RPMI 2650 cells showed that HA-CL could act not only as carrier for SAP and active ingredient itself, but potentially also as mucoadhesive agent. In conclusion, these results suggest that HA-CL and SAP had anti-inflammatory activity and acted in combination to accelerate wound healing. Therefore, LYO HA-CL - SAP could be a potential adjuvant in nasal anti-inflammatory formulations.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore the potential of a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model to predict tablet density. First, we calculated 3381 molecular descriptors for 81 active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). Second, we obtained data that were merged with a dataset including powder properties that we had constructed previously. Next, we prepared 81 types of tablet, each containing API, microcrystalline cellulose, and magnesium stearate using direct compression at 120, 160, and 200 MPa, and measured the tablet density. Finally, we applied the boosted-tree machine learning approach to construct a QSPR model and to identify crucial factors from the large complex dataset. The QSPR model achieved statistically good performance. A sensitivity analysis of the QSPR model revealed that molecular descriptors related to the average molecular weight and electronegativity of the API were crucial factors in tablet density, whereas the effects of powder properties were relatively insignificant. Moreover, we found that these descriptors had a positive linear relationship with tablet density. This study indicates that a QSPR approach is possibly useful for in silico prediction of tablet density for tablets prepared using more than a threshold compression pressure, and to allow a deeper understanding of tablet density.

AB In the present study the feasibility of an in situ co-amorphisation of the basic drug carvedilol with the acidic co-former aspartic acid was investigated by immersion of film-coated tablets consisting of the two compounds in 0.1 M HCl. Tablets containing either crystalline carvedilol with aspartic acid or only crystalline carvedilol were prepared and coated with a gastro-resistant but water-permeable coating of a methacrylic acid - ethyl acrylate copolymer (Eudragit (R) L 55). The film-coated tablets were immersed in 0.1 M HCl for 0, 45, and 120 min and their solid-state properties were analysed by X-ray powder diffractometry (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The drug release behaviour from these tablets was investigated at pH 6.8. It was shown that the formulation containing carvedilol with aspartic acid formed a co-amorphous system during immersion, while the formulation containing only carvedilol remained crystalline. FTIR spectroscopy indicated molecular interactions in the co-amorphous carvedilol-aspartic acid system, which explained the single T-g found using DMA (106 +/- 4 degrees C). However, because of a lack of sufficient disintegration, drug release of the immersed co-amorphous formulation was lower than from the untreated tablets (immersed for 0 min) containing only carvedilol or the crystalline physical mixture of carvedilol and aspartic acid. After overcoming the disadvantage of the insufficient disintegration, it may be concluded that in situ co-amorphisation in a film-coated tablet by immersion in 0.1 M HCl appears to be a feasible formulation approach for poorly water-soluble basic drugs.

AB Site-specific colon drug delivery is a practical approach for the treatment of local diseases of the colon with several advantages such as rapid onset of action and reduction of the dosage of the drug as well as minimization of harmful side effects. 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is a drug of choice in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and colitis. For the efficient delivery of this drug, it is vital to prevent 5-ASA release in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract and to promote its release in the proximal colon. Different approaches including chemical manipulation of drug molecule for production of prodrugs or modification of drug delivery systems using pH-dependent, time-dependent and/or bacterially biodegradable materials have been tried to optimize 5-ASA delivery to the colon. In the current review, the different strategies utilized in the design and development of an oral colonic delivery dosage form of 5-ASA are presented and discussed.

AB The aim of this work was to develop biocompatible ionic liquids (ILs) for enhancement of dermal delivery of hydrophilic macromolecules. The ILs were prepared from malic acid and choline, which are commonly used as food additives and generally regarded as safe. The choline malate IL (CM-IL) was formed via ionic interactions, which has been validated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. Analysis by differential scanning calorimetry confirmed a melting point of -65.2 degrees C for CM-IL. In skin penetration study, CM-IL was proved to be able to deliver a model hydrophilic macromolecule dextran into deep skin. The amount of dextran delivered to epidermis and dermis by CM-IL is approximately two folds that of by dextran solution. Enhanced in vivo skin penetration by CM-IL was proved as well. The fluorescence of FITC-dextran could be observed permeating pervasively throughout the skin from 4 h to 24 h, while in the control groups it was mainly concentrated in stratum cornea (SC) and hair follicles. In addition, CM-IL did not shown any irritation to mice skin within 7 days of successive treatment and any toxicity to human epidermal cells (HEK-A) within 24 h. In conclusion, CM-IL could be potentially used as enhancers or vehicles for dermal delivery of hydrophilic macromolecules.

AB Particle size reduction of FeSO4 (iron(II) sulfate, IS) from micron to nano size was achieved by a combination of hot-melt extrusion (HME) processing and the input of Span 80, Tween 80, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) 6000. Conveying, kneading, and extruding steps of the HME process and a decrease in the surface tension by surfactants were introduced to produce FeSO4 nanoparticles (NPs) in an aqueous environment. The FeSO4-based NPs (ISNPs) in the dispersion were composed of FeSO4, Span 80, Tween 80, and PEG 6000 and displayed a hydrodynamic size of 350-400 nm (5-50 mg/mL ISNPs concentration range) and a spherical shape. Considering the feeding ratio of FeSO4 (20%, w/w) used for preparing the ISNPs, FeSO4 appears to be wrapped by Span 80, Tween 80, and PEG 6000 according to the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. ISNPs exhibited different thermodynamic properties from those of FeSO4 itself. In colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells, the ISNPs group exhibited enhanced antiproliferation and apoptosis potentials compared to the FeSO4 group (p < 0.05). Histological staining data of a dissected intestine after oral administration of ISNPs suggest the absence of severe intestinal toxicities compared to the control (no treatment) group. All of these results imply the feasibility of the use of the developed ISNPs for the treatment of colon cancers with oral administration.

AB Methotrexate functionalized silica-gelatin hybrid aerogel (SGM) was synthesized by the sol-gel method and co-gelation. The drug methotrexate (MTX) is covalently linked to the collagen molecules of the hybrid aerogel backbone by amide-bond. The characteristic MTX content of the functionalized hybrid aerogel is ca. 6 wt% by the dry weight. The micronization of SGM aerogel in water yields cell sized (d = 10-20 um) particles. The cytotoxicity of these microparticles against tumor cell lines (SCC VII and HL-60) is unprecedentedly high, it is approximately equivalent to that of an equal dose of free (dissolved) MTX, as proved by in vitro experiments. Thus, the activity of MTX is intact after aerogel functionalization, and the mass specific cytotoxicity of SGM is high enough for medical applications. Drug release studies verified that MTX cannot be liberated from this drug delivery system solely by chemical hydrolysis, however, collagenase enzymatic activity releases MTX from the functionalized hybrid aerogel. The cytotoxicity of SGM towards various cancerous and non-cancerous cell lines correlates with the collagenase activities of cells. Therefore, conjugation with the hybrid aerogel provides a controlled release system for the antineoplastic agent MTX. The morphology of the delivery vehicle was chosen to adapt the size of cancer cells; thus the metastatic pathways of the tumor cells can get flooded.

AB Interferon (IFN)-gamma plays an important role in antiviral, anti-proliferative, immunomodulatory and pro-inflammatory activities. However, the short therapeutic half-life of IFN-gamma lessens its efficacy. Albumin fusion strategy is one of the most effective ways to improve the pharmacokinetic properties of cytokines. In this study, N- and C-terminal canine albumin fusions with canine IFN-gamma were expressed in the baculovirus expression system. The fusion proteins stimulated Stall phosphorylation at levels similar to that of the recombinant IFN. The antiviral, anti-proliferative and promote apoptosis activity of CSA-IFN-gamma was lower than IFN-gamma-CSA and both were less than that of recombinant IFN-gamma. In vivo pharmacokinetics demonstrated a significantly longer half-life for CSA-IFN-gamma (21.73 h) than for IFN-gamma-CSA (6.51 h) and canine reIFN-gamma (2.22 h) in Wistar rats. CSA-IFN-gamma was also more effective than IFN-gamma-CSA and canine reIFN-gamma at inhibiting growth of canine renal malignant histiocytosis in nude mice. Our results indicated that a canine serum albumin fusion at the N-terminus of IFN-gamma prolongs its half-life and improves its in vivo antitumor activity.

AB Cardiovascular ailments are the foremost trigger of death in the world today, including myocardial infarction and ischemic heart diseases. To date, extraordinary measures have been prescribed, from the perspectives of both conventional medical therapies and surgeries, to enforce cardiac cell regeneration post cardiac traumas, albeit with limited long-term success. The prospects of successful heart transplants are also grim, considering exorbitant costs and unavailability of suitable donors in most cases. From the perspective of cardiac revascularization, use of nanoparticles and nanoparticle mediated targeted drug delivery have garnered substantial attention, attributing to both active and passive heart targeting, with enhanced target specificity and sensitivity. This review focuses on this aspect, while outlining the progress in targeted delivery of nanomedicines in the prognosis and subsequent therapy of cardiovascular disorders, and recapitulating the benefits and intrinsic challenges associated with the incorporation of nanoparticles. This article categorically provides an overview of nanoparticle-mediated targeted delivery systems and their implications in handling cardiovascular diseases, including their intrinsic benefits and encountered procedural trials and challenges. Additionally, the solicitations of aptamers in targeted drug delivery with identical objectives, are presented. This includes a detailed appraisal on various aptamer-navigated nanoparticle targeted delivery platforms in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular maladies. Despite a few impending challenges, subject to additional investigations, both nanoparticles as well as aptamers show a high degree of promise, and pose as the next generation of drug delivery vehicles, in targeted cardiovascular therapy.

AB Use of hot melt extrusion (HME) as continuous manufacturing process in the cocrystal synthesis is of increasing interest from both industrial and academic perspective and it is seen as a newly developing branch of mechanochemistry with possible broad application in single step synthesis and formulation of pharmaceutical cocrystals. Furthermore, one-step formulation of pharmaceutical products results in combined processing of pharmaceutical cocrystal mixtures with polymers using HME, which may result in phase change or formation of amorphous solid dispersions during the material processing. The manuscript aims at providing selection guidelines and understanding of processing parameters and instrumental setup of importance to design the HME process for cocrystal synthesis. Furthermore, importance of stoichiometry control of the final product and the matrix selection criteria in simultaneous synthesis and formulation of pharmaceutical cocrystals via HME are provided. The first part of this review, introduce mechanochemical methods of cocrystals synthesis along brief explanation of the possible molecular mechanisms of cocrystal synthesis via mechanochemical approach. Subsequently, the critical process parameters i.e. temperature, screw speed, screw configuration or material feed rate of importance in successful synthesis of high quality product are described followed by literature examples of the processing of neat cocrystal compounds or matrix assisted cocrystallisation.

DE Mesenchymal stem cells; Exosome; TRAIL; Exo-TRAIL; Cancer
AB Exosomes are biological nano-sized vesicles (similar to 30-200 nm in diameter) that are produced by a wide range of cells and play several roles in cell-cell communications. These vesicles contain membrane and cytoplasmic components of producing cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the ideal producer of exosomes. The secreted vesicles from MSCs are promising biological vehicles for cell-free therapy in regenerative medicine, cancer therapy and targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to the tumor cells. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising member of the TNF family with selective effect on cancerous cells. Recent evidences showed that the membrane TRAIL-armed exosomes possess anti-tumor activity. However, the effect of in vivo administration of TRAIL-armed exosomes has not been reported so far. In the current study, mesenchymal stem cells expressing TRAIL/GFP proteins were prepared with the help of a non-viral vector based on polyethylenimine 25 kDa. Then, exosomes containing TRAIL protein (Exo-TRAIL) were isolated from the supernatant of genetically engineered MSCs and characterized. Antitumor activity of both MSC-derived exosomes and Exo-TRAIL was investigated in vitro and in vivo in three models. The results indicated that the co-injection of both Exo-TRAIL and tumor cells delayed the tumor appearance. Besides, the tumor volume/weight was efficiently decreased in tumor bearing mice. Moreover, it was shown that multi-dose injections of Exo-TRAIL reduced the tumor size while single dose treatment with Exo-TRAIL did not show significant anti-tumor activity. To conclude, these results suggested that MSC-derived Exo-TRAIL has a potential capacity for cancer treatment.

AB Lung cancer has become the most prevalent neoplasm throughout the world with 1,2 million deaths per year. Molecular genetic analyses have suggested that KRAS mutation is much more frequency in NSCLC. Significant challenges are to develop selective pharmacological inhibitors for RAS mutation to treat cancers driven. In our study, we used the combinatorial strategy to target oncogene addiction for RAS-mutant cells and the data showed that ABT199 and irinotecan leads to RAS-mutant lung cancer cell growth inhibition and enhanced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, P131VAKT signaling was down-regulated by the combination in KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells. Importantly, the effects of ABT199 and irinotecan combination are synergistic on the RAS-mutant lung cancer cells. Therefore, the combination suggests a strong synergy in vivo and a potential avenue for therapeutic treatment of KRAS-mutant cancers which are otherwise difficult targeted by small molecules.

AB Many phyto-compounds are found to have anti-angiogenesis property. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol, has been used as medicinal plant for years with different biological activities. Here, we investigated the effect of Curcumin on angiogenesis potential of human endothelial cells. Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) were treated with different concentration of curcumin over a period of 72 h. Cell survival rate was measured by MIT assay. Cell migration and tubulogenesis were studied by scratch and tubulogenesis assays. The expression level of VEGF was monitored by RT-PCR. We also monitored the phosphorylation of FAK and P-38 MAPK by western blotting. Compared to control group, curcumin decreased HUVECs survival rate after 72 h. We found that the migration of HUVECs was decreased after curcumin treatment compared to the control (p < 0.0001). Cell alignment and tubulogenesis activity were found to be inhibited compared to cells from the VEGF group < 0.05). The expression level of VEGF was increased in curcumin treated cells at first 24 h time period. Based on data from the current experiment, the protein level of p-FAK/FAK ratio was increased coincided with a decrease in p-P38/P38 ratio treatment with curcumin (p < 0.0001). These data demonstrated that curcumin inhibited HUVECs angiogenesis potential by modulation of FAK/P-38 MAPK signaling pathway.

AB Morphological abnormality of spermatozoa head is a human infertility syndrome caused by spermatogenesis defects. The genetic alterations associated with macrozoospermia, globozoospermia and acephalic spermatozoa are relatively definite, whereas the underlying pathogenesis of small-headed sperm remains unclear. Here, we report a 32-year-old infertile male from a consanguineous family, who presented with 95% of small-headed sperm. Subsequent whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis identified a homozygous mutation (c. 56C > T [P19L) in Ring Finger Protein 220 (RNF220) gene, which is dominantly expressed in testis. RNF220 protein is an E3 ligase promoting the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of SIN3 Transcription Regulator Family Member B (SIN3B), a chromatin-associated protein, which is primarily expressed in the nucleus of germ cells and plays a vital role in chromatin condensation. Notably, this variant could promote the RNF220 protein degradation leading to excessive condensed chromatin in the sperm through the medium SIN3B. Therefore, our study is the first to identify an autosomal recessive genetic mutation in RNF220 that was responsible for small headed sperm in humans by regulating the expression of chromatin-associated protein SIN3B.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer in adults and is a leading cause of worldwide cancer mortality. Intrahepatic dissemination and extrahepatic metastasis are key factors in malignant growth of HCC. Reducing HCC-associated metastasis is critically dependent on uncovering molecular signaling pathways that promote HCC metastasis. In this study, we explored the effect of TGF-beta 1 and RELN on cell migration, and the relationship between TGF-beta 1 and RELN in HCC cells. The data presented that TGF-beta 1 and RELN showed an opposite expression pattern, and either increased expression of TGF-beta 1 or decreased expression of RELN increased HCC cell migration ability. We also found TGF-beta 1 enhanced cell migration ability was through repressing RELN expression, as overexpression of RELN impaired TGF-beta 1 enhanced cell migration. Our work revealed the relationship between TGF-beta 1 and RELN and uncovered the important role of RELN in suppressing cell migration in I-ICC cells.

AB Zinc finger antisense 1 (ZFAS1), a newly identified long non-coding RNA, is a transcript antisense to the 5' end of the protein-coding gene zinc finger NFX1-type containing 1 which hosts three C/D-box small nucleolar RNAs (SNORDs) within sequential introns: Snordl2, Snord12b, and Snordl 2c. ZFAS1 is dysregulated and acts as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor in different human malignancies. ZFAS1 has been implicated in many aspects of carcinogenesis, including proliferation, invasion, metastasis, apoptosis, cell cycle, and drug resistance. The mechanisms underlying the effects of ZFASI are complex and involve multiple signaling pathways. In this review, the multiple pathological functions of ZFAS1 in diverse malignancies are systematically reviewed to elucidate the molecular basis of its biological roles and to provide new directions for future research.

AB Background: Renal fibrosis promotes the progression of chronic renal disease to end-stage renal disease. Microvascular damage and loss play an important role in renal fibrosis. Intermedin (IMD) is expressed mainly in the heart and kidney. IMD has been shown to increase renal blood flow and reduce the loss of glomerular and surrounding renal tubules, but its role in mediating microvascular damage in renal fibrosis remains to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the effects of IMD on microvascular damage in a renal fibrosis model.
   Methods: We created a rat model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) to clarify the effect of microvascular damage on renal fibrosis and the effect of intermedin on reversing renal vascular injury and promoting angiogenesis. Rats were divided randomly into three groups: sham, DUO, and DUO IMD. The sham group underwent free ureteral ligation but not occlusion. Rats in the latter two groups underwent UUO, and rats in the IMD group were additionally administered intermedin (100 ng/kg/h) daily. On the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th days after surgery, abdominal aortic blood and the obstructed kidneys were harvested from the rats (n = 6) for analysis. \
   Result: IMP was found to protect against renal vascular injury and to increase microvessel density. Molecularly, IMD upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF VEGFR2) pathway activity. The VEGF VEGFR2 pathway might be the underlying mechanism mediating the protective activities of IMD in promoting angiogenesis, delaying renal fibrosis, and improving renal function.
   Conclusion: IMD could be a potential candidate treatment for renal fibrosis.

AB High risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are the causative agent in virtually every cervical cancer as well as a host of other anogenital and oropharyngeal malignancies. These viruses must activate DNA repair pathways to facilitate their replication, while avoiding the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis that can accompany DNA damage. HPV oncoproteins facilitate each of these goals, but also reduce genome stability. Our data dissect the cytotoxic and cytoprotective characteristics of HPV oncogenes in cervical cancer cells. These data show that while the transformation of keratinocytes by HPV oncogene leaves these cells more sensitive to UV, the oncogenes also protect against UV-induced apoptosis. Cisplatin and UV resistant cervical cancer cell lines were generated and probed for their sensitivity to genotoxic agents. Cervical cancer cells can acquire resistance to one DNA crosslinking agent (UV or cisplatin) without gaining broad tolerance of crosslinked DNA. Further, cisplatin resistance may or may not result in sensitivity to PARP1 inhibition.

AB NAC transcription factors play important roles in plant biological processes, including plant development, environmental stress responses and element enrichment. A novel NAC transcription factor gene, designated SmNAC1, was isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza. SmNAC1 was localized in the nucleus in onion protoplasts and exhibited transcriptional activation activities in yeast. In addition, the SmNAC1 protein could specifically bind to the cis-elements of the NAC proteins. SmNAC7 was expressed at a higher level in the leaves of S. miltiorrhiza, indicating that SmNAC1 might be involved in the transportation of zinc. To examine the function of SmNAC1, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing SmNAC1 were generated. Zinc content assays in the transgenic plants demonstrated that overexpressed SmNAC1 plants had enhanced tolerance to high zinc concentrations, and zinc was enriched in the shoot tissues. Our results demonstrate that SmNAC1 plays important roles in the response to zinc stress. Zinc was mainly enriched in the leaves of S. miltiorrhiza and the shoot tissues of transgenic Arabidopsis plants. SmNAC1 might participate in zinc transportation from the roots to the shoots, that constitutes a useful gene for improving zinc content in plants.

AB Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are specified by maternally provided determinants in fish. PGCs migrate then into prospective gonadal sites during early development and give rise to germ cell lineage. PGC disrupted animals do not sexually mature which has a range of commercial as well as environmental benefits. To find potential target genes for sterilisation of Nile tilapia, relative mRNA abundance patterns and tissue distribution of four nanos, two piwil, dndl, vasa and three pum genes were investigated during ontogenic development from unfertilised eggs to newly hatched larvae and in adult tissues, respectively, The ontogenic pattern of RNA abundance revealed that all the investigated gene transcripts are maternally deposited to varying degrees, except for nanos2 which is not expressed in eggs. The ontogenic patterns of relative RNA abundance could be grouped into three categories. The first one, including nanos3, piwill, piwil2, dndl and vasa, showed abundant transcript levels during early developmental stages which are then degraded during the period of maternal to zygotic transition between blastula and gastrula stages with a reduction in expression of four to five orders of magnitude by hatching stage. Another, including purn2 and pum3, showed similar patterns to the first group, but the transcript levels are reduced by only two orders of magnitude. The third group, including nanosI a, nanosl b and pum 1, was characterised by a zygotic increase. nanos2 had no detectable transcripts until hatching stage. The tissue screening of nanosl a, nanosi b, pima, purn2 and purn3 showed that they are expressed in various tissues, implying their potential pleiotropic effects in these tissues apart from gonads. In contrast, nanos3, piwill, piwil2, dndl and vasa appeared to be exclusively expressed in gonads (both ovary and testis), and nanos2 showed testis-specific expression. Based on these results nanos3, piwill, piwil2, dndl and vasa were prioritised among the 11 selected genes as potential target genes for sterilisation in Nile tilapia as they have no significant zygotic expression during embryogenesis, they are expressed exclusively in gonads and maternally deposited. These features suggest a potential role of these genes in the specification and maintenance of PGCs during the ontogenic development of Nile tilapia.

AB The cellulose synthase gene superfamily, which includes the cellulose synthase (CesA) and cellulose synthaselike (Csl) gene families, plays a vital role m the biosynthesis of cellulose and hemicellulose in plants. However, these genes have not been extensively studied in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), a model for Solanaeeae plants and for fleshy fruit development. Here, we identified and systematically analyzed 38 CesA/Csl family members that contained cellulose synthase domain regions, and categorized their encoded proteins into 6 subfamilies (CesA, CsIA, Cs1B, COD, Cs1E, and Cs1G) based on phylogenetic analysis. Most CesA/Cs1 genes from tomato are closely related to those from Arabidopsis, but the families have distinct features regarding gene structure, chromosome distribution and localization, phylogeny, and deduced protein sequence, indicating that they arose via different evolutionary process. Furthermore, expression analysis of CesA/CsI genes in different tissues at various developmental stages showed that most CesAs were constitutively expressed with differential expression levels in various organs; three CsID genes were expressed specifically in flowers, and four CesA and five Csl putative genes were preferentially expressed In fruits. Our results provide insight into the general characteristics of the CesA/CsI genes in tomato, and lay the foundation for further functional studies of CesA/Csl genes in tomato and other So/anaceae species.

AB Cluster of differentiation 28 (CD28) is a co-stimulatory receptor found on the surface of T cells. Takifugu obscurus is a kind of anadromous fish species. In this study, the full-length sequence of To-CD28 was obtained, including a 672-bp open reading frame that encodes a peptide chain of 223 amino acids. The phylogenetic analysis showed that To-CD28 is similar to the CD28 protein in Takifugu rubripes. The total hematocyte count distinctly decreased after TBT-Cl exposure, showing the adverse effects of TBT-Cl invasion and self-adjusting ability upon To-CD28 accumulation. The production of reactive oxygen species increased, demonstrating the oxidation resistance of T. obscurus when exposed to . The tissue expression patterns indicated To-CD28 is a widely distributed receptor in T. obscurus. Its high expression in the liver and gill suggests that To-CD28 could be potentially functioned in TBT-Cl toxic process. The mRNA levels of To-CD28 and relative genes in the TLR-MyD88 signal pathway were significantly up-regulated under TBT-Cl exposure. The immunohistochemistry also showed that the To-CD28 protein signal was enhanced under TBT-Cl exposure, which proved that the positive protection of To-CD28 for maintaining homeostasis. Our study indicated that To-CD28 might participate in the toxicity mechanism upon TBT-Cl exposure and regulate homeostasis stability of T. obscurus.

AB Objective: To determine the effect of miR-423-5p on the progression of prostate cancer (PC).
   Methods: miR-423-5p and GRIM-19 expressions were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. PC cell proliferation was measured by MIT assay. PC cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Dual luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the interaction between miR-423-5p and GRIM-19.
   Results: Compared with normal prostate tissues and prostate epithelial cell HPrEC, miR-423-5p was up-regulated in human PC tissues and PC3 cells, whereas GRIM-19 expression was decreased. Inhibition of miR-423-5p suppressed PC3 cell proliferation, promoted PC3 cell apoptosis, and decreased anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2 expression. GRIM-19 was a target of miR-423-5p, and GRIM-19 was negatively regulated by miR-423-5p in PC3 cells. In addition, miR-423-5p knockdown inhibited the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of PC3 cells through GRIM-19. In vivo experiments showed that miR-423-5p inhibitor administration reduced tumor volume, down-regulated miR-423-5p and GRIM-19 expressions in PC tissues of nude mice.
   Conclusion: Inhibition of miR-423-5p suppressed PC through targeting GRIM-19.

AB The Chinese Crested duck (Fengtou duck) reappeared in China recently. Along with white feathers and a black bill and feet, the Fengtou duck has a high feather crest. This breed can be used for ornamental purposes or as a model organism; however, little is known about the genetic basis and development of its distinct morphological features. In this study, we observed the skull and feather crest of Fengtou duck in the embryonic stages. As a result, the protuberances of the head integument could be clearly observed at embryonic stage E9, and small perforations in the skull were first visible at E13 and were clearer at E15. Besides, intracranial fat in a small number of individuals was found starting at E15, and a small number of osteophytes was found at E18. In addition, hematoxylin eosin (HE) and Oil Red-O staining of the crest cushion and intracranial tissue revealed fat tissue accumulation. Previous studies demonstrated that homeobox c8 (HOXC8) played a critical role in chicken crest formation. Here, we cloned the HOXC8 from Fengtou duck and determined that its transcript was highly expressed in the crest cushion; moreover, HOXC8 was detected in this tissue with a molecular weight of 38 kDa in the Fengtou duck. In conclusion, embryos of Fengtou duck have different small protuberances and perforations in the skull, including accumulation of intracranial tissue and osteophytes in some cases. Furthermore, HOXC8 may regulate the formation of the crest. These findings provide novel insight into the ontogenesis of the crest cushion in crested ducks and a basis for future studies on their evolutionary origins.

AB Background: Several investigators have reported that complement receptor 1 (CR1) likely play a role in the pathogenesis of tumors, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, the association of genetic polymorphisms of CR1 with risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver disease remains unexplored.
   Methods: In a case control study of 399 HBV-related liver disease patients and 227 healthy controls, we genotyped two SNPs in CR1 (rs3811381 and rs2274567) and assessed their associations with risk of HBV-related liver disease.
   Results: No significant differences were observed in the frequency distribution of genotypes or alleles between CR1 rs3811381 and rs2274567 polymorphisms in patients and controls. However, stratification analysis indicated that these two CR1 polymorphisms may contribute to the risk of HBV- hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in subgroups of males, alcohol drinkers and nonsmokers. Further, our results showed that the rs3811381 polymorphism may contribute to HBV-HCC risk in subgroups of older and younger subjects, while the G allele, AG and the combined AG + GG genotypes of rs2274567 may be risk factors for HBV-HCC in younger subjects. In addition, our results indicated that subjects who carried the rs3811381 G allele and the rs2274567 AG genotype were at decreased risk of HBV-liver cirrhosis (LC) in subgroups of females.
   Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that the CR1 gene rs3811381 and rs2274567 polymorphisms may contribute to HBV-HCC and HBV-CHB risk, particularly in subgroups of males, alcohol drinkers, nonsmokers, while these two CR1 polymorphisms were found to associate with decreased risk of HBV-LC, particularly in females. Further validation of these results is warranted.

AB The HAP3 subfamily gene RcLEC1-B, was isolated from protocorm-like body (PLB) of Rosa conflict, encodes 213 amino acid residues. It was shown that RcLECI-B was specifically expressed in PLB of R. casino and its sub cellular localization is in the nucleus. Overexpression of RcLECI-B in Arabidopsis resulted in a decrease in endogenous ABA level, an increase in GA, IAA and CTK contents, and an increased number of branches. RcLEC1-B promotes the formation of spontaneous embryoids, suggesting that it may be a homolog of the Arabidopsis LECI gene. RcLEC1-B-OE changed the number and morphology of flower organs and resulted in open carpels and exposed ovules, along with a reduced percentage of fertile fruit. This is the first observation that overexpression of a homolog of LECI in Arabidopsis can lead to morphological changes in floral organs, cuticle defects, and adhesions between organs; this may result from the increased level of gibberellin in the transgenic plants.

AB To investigate whether the members of the mammalian Achaete-State Complex homologue (ASH) gene family have evolved functional differences, we used the patterning of bristles as a phenotypic marker. Drosophila uses a single genetic locus - the A chaete-Scute Complex - to demarcate the regions of the body where bristles can form. We found 4-5 Achaete-Scute Complex homologue genes (ASH) in the mammalian genome, which are homologous with scute in Drosophila. Although ASH2 and ASH3 have gained new functions during evolution, the function of ASH4 and its evolutionary changes are still unclear. In this study, we overexpressed mouse and human ASHI and ASH4 in the Drosophila notum respectively. The results show that both the protein sequence and cis-regulatory elements of mammalian ASH1 have conserved an ancient proneural function during evolution. However, mouse ASH4 has lost proneural function partly due to truncation of a C-terminal amino acid domain. Interestingly, instead of a similar loss of proneural function, we found human ASH4 can actually inhibit Drosophila bristle development, implying that human ASH4 may be a potential factor relating to skin development in human being. Our results demonstrate gene duplication of the ASH family may have led to a novel function during evolution.

AB Moringa oleifera (Moringaceae) is a plant known for having high antioxidant potency, anticancer, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective etc. and many more activities. Besides these, Moringaceae has the potential for attenuating the male sexual dysfunction. Reactive oxygen species/ROS were increased in cryptorchidism and therefore cause infertility by damaging sperm DNA and germ cell apoptosis. There was an increase in heat shock proteins (HSP) in cells, which is affected by heat shock. In the present study, the antioxidant effects of two different doses of M. oleifera Lam Extract (MOLE) on experimentally induced cryptorchid testes of rats was investigated. Forty two male rats (16 days old) were divided into four groups: a normal control group, a cryptorchidism-induced control group and two cryptorchidism-induced groups treated orally with either 400 or BOO mg/kg MOLE for 2 weeks. Our study showed that there were ruptures from interstitial spaces, separation of the germ cells from basal membrane, falling of the germ cells into the lumen, perivascular fibrosis, oedema, increased level of HSP70, apoptosis, malondialdehyde (MDA) and decrease in the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) after the cryptorchidism. We found that pathological damages, oxidative stress, expression of the HSP70 and germ cell apoptosis were decreased in treated groups with MOLE. In brief, we can say that aqueous extract of M. oleifera reduces the oxidative stress in a unilateral cryptorchidism induced rats, and it might attenuate histopathological damages, HSP expression and germ cell apoptosis.

AB Aims: ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) gene polymorphism has been reported as one of the genetic risk factors for T2DM in various populations with conflicting results. The aim of this study is to investigate the association of ABCA1 C69T polymorphism and lipid profile with T2DM in Bangladeshi population.
   Materials and methods: A total of 102 T2DM subjects and 98 healthy controls were recruited and their genotypes for ABCA1 gene polymorphisms were determined based on the PCR-RFLP technique. Serum lipid profiles (total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C and TG) were also estimated by using standard methods.
   Results: ABCA 1 (C69T) genotypes frequencies were estimated. The percentages of CC, CT and TT genotypes at 69 position of ABCA1 gene were 31.63%, 58.16% and 10.21% in control as well as 22.54%, 69.60% and 7.86% in diabetes group respectively. Significant association was not found between ABCA1 (C69T) genotypes and T2DM in Bangladeshi population (Odd Ratio: 1.67; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.88 to 3.19 for CT genotype and Odd Ratio: 1.07; Confidence Interval: 0.36 to 3.16 for TT genotype; p > 0.05). Serum lipid profiles were not associated with T2DM.
   Conclusion: ABCA1 gene polymorphism might not be a genetic risk factor for T2DM subjects among Bangladeshis. We did not find a relationship between genotypes and lipid concentrations in our two groups. Study with a larger sample size will help us to understand the relationship of ABCA1 C69T genotype and lipid profile with T2DM.

DE Shell color; Yesso scallop; Mantle; MITF
ID PACIFIC OYSTER; TRANSCRIPTION; MARKERS; PIGMENT; MANTLE
AB The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is the center of the regulator network of melanin synthesis in vertebrates. However, the role of MITF in shell color formation is poorly studied in mollusks. In the present study, an MITF gene, PyMITF, was first identified at the whole-genome level in Yesso scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis), an evolutionarily and economically important species, the shell color of which shows polymorphism. The PyMITF is a large gene spanning similar to 37 kb in the genome with 7 introns and 8 exons. A basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ) domain was detected in the PyMITF protein sequence, which can bind the canonical E-box sequence in the promoter region of the downstream genes. Phylogenetic analysis of the MITFs among vertebrates and invertebrates revealed that the molecular evolution of MITFs was consistent with the species taxonomy. Different expression levels of PyMITF were detected among different shell color strains, indicating the important role of PyMITF involved in shell pigmentation. Besides, PyMITF was expressed at a significantly higher level in the central mantle than that in the edge mantle, proving the participation of the central mantle in shell color formation in molecular level for the first time. The work provides valuable information for the molecular mechanism study of shell color formation.

AB Objective: The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a hormonal signaling mechanism implicated in the atherosclerosis and regulation of blood pressure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) a key enzyme in the RAS, plays important roles in vascular remodeling atherosclerosis, and ischemic stroke. The aim of this study was to examine the possible contribution of the I/D in the ACE gene, M235T and T174M in the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene polymorphisms with ischemic stroke in young Mexican population.
   Materials and methods: A total of 224 patients with diagnosis of idiopathic ischemic stroke <= 45 years of age, and 224 controls matched by age and gender, were recruited from 2006 and 2016. The I/D, M235T and T174M polymorphisms were determined in all participants by PCR-RFLP.
   Results: There was a significant difference in the M235T genotype distribution (p = 0.01) and allele frequency between two groups (p = 0.01). Also, we found a significant difference in the T174M genotype distribution (p = 0.01) and the allele frequency between groups; (p = 0.02). In contrast, in I/D polymorphism, there was a similar genotype distribution; (p = 0.20) and allele distribution (p = 0.20). There were independent factors for ischemic stroke: M235T and T174M polymorphisms, smoking, hypertension, and familial history of atherothrombotic disease. The AGT levels were increased in the group of patients with stroke compared with the control group, but the AGT levels were not influenced by the allele or genotype in each polymorphism.
   Conclusions: The M235T and T174M polymorphisms represented an increased risk for stroke in young Mexican individuals. In contrast, the I/D was not associated with in the same group of patients. The AGT levels were higher in the acute phase of stroke, but it was not determined by the polymorphisms.

AB Mitochondria both produce the energy of the cell as ATP via respiration and regulate cellular metabolism. Accordingly, any deletion or mutation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) may result in a disease. One of these diseases is Kearns Sayre syndrome (KSS), described for the first time in 1958, where different large-scale deletions of different sizes and at different positions have been reported in the mitochondrial genome of patients with similar clinical symptoms. In this study, sequences of the mitochondrial genome of three patients with clinic features of KSS were analyzed. Our results revealed the position, heteroplasmy percentage, size of deletions, and their haplogroups. Two patients contained deletions reported previously and one patient showed a new deletion not reported previously. These results display for the first time a systematic analysis of mtDNA variants in the whole mtDNA genome of patients with KSS to help to understand their association with the disease.

In the current investigation, we firstly isolated and characterized a lncRNA-HOTAIR transcript from the secondary hair follicle of cashmere goat. Also, we analyzed its transcriptional pattern and methylation level of HOTAIR gene promoter in secondary hair follicle of cashmere goat during anagen and telogen stages. Nucleotide composition analysis indicated that the contents of Adenine (A) and Thymine (T) are higher than that of Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) in lncRNA-HOTAIR transcript of cashmere goat with the highest frequency distribution of AG nucleotide pair (8.06%). The regulatory network analysis showed a directly or indirectly complex regulatory relationships between lncRNA-HOTAIR of cashmere goat and its potential target molecules: miRNAs, mRNAs and proteins. Also, we showed that lncRNA-HOTAIR was properly transcribed at both anagen and telogen stages of secondary hair follicle of cashmere goat with the anagen being significantly higher than telogen in its expression, which suggest that lncRNA-HOTAIR transcript might be involved in the reconstruction of secondary hair follicle with the formation and growth of cashmere fiber. Taken together with methylation analysis of HOTAIR gene promoter, our data suggest that the promoter methylation of HOTAIR gene most likely is involved in its transcriptional suppression in secondary hair follicle of cashmere goat.

AB There is little evidence for the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of circadian rhythms during enamel development. Few studies have used ameloblast-like cell line LS8 to study the circadian rhythm of gene activities related to enamel formation. However, the transcriptomic analysis of miRNA expression in LS8 cells has not been established yet. In this study, we analyze the oscillations of miRNAs in LS8 cells during one-day cycle of 24 h by next generation deep sequencing. After removal of low quality reads, contaminants, and ligation products, we obtained a high number of clean reads in all 12 samples from four different time points. The length distribution analysis indicated that 77.5% of clean reads were between 21 and 24 nucleotides (nt), of which 35.81% reads exhibited a length of 22 nt. In total, we identified 1471 miRNAs in LS8 cells throughout all four time-points. 1330 (90.41%) miRNAs were identified as known miRNA sequences, whereas 139 (9.59%) were unannotated and classified as novel miRNA sequences. The differential expression analysis showed that 191 known miRNAs exhibited significantly (P-value < 0.01) different levels of expression across three time-points investigated (T6, T12, and T18) compared to TO. Verification of sequencing data using qRT-PCR on six selected miRNAs suggested good correlation between the two methods. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment of predicted target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs. The present study shows that miRNAs are highly expressed in LS8 cells and that a significant number of them oscillate during one-day cycle of 24 h. This is the first transcriptomic analysis of miRNAs in ameloblast-like cell line LS8 that can be potentially used to further characterize the epigenetic regulation of miRNAs during enamel formation.

AB Disease causes large economic losses to the pig industry worldwidely, immunity plays an important role in the process of resistance to disease. In the present study, to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying different levels of disease resistance, we obtained the miRNA and mRNA expression profiles from the spleens of three groups of sows, including 180-day-old Queshan Black (Q-F), 3-day-old Yorkshire (Y-N) and 180-day-old Yorkshire (Y-F) pigs. The results showed that 85 miRNAs and 5093 genes were differentially expressed in Y-F vs Y-N, and 20 miRNAs and 1283 genes were differentially expressed in Q-F vs Y-F. Gene ontology analysis of these differentially expressed genes revealed their critical roles in response to immune response-related signaling pathways. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying immune diversity based on differentially expressed miRNAs and genes, the regulatory network between the node miRNAs and genes were established using Cytoscape. The results showed that the identified candidate miRNAs and genes were associated with immune response, and also indicated their potential roles in disease resistance variance between different pig breeds and stages. From the above, this research detected the key factors that were involved in disease resistance, and provide useful information for disease resistance breeding.

AB Introduction: PAX1 has been identified to be associated with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). However, data are unavailable for northern Chinese populations, and it is important to determine the exact clinical phenotypes of the associated genetic polymorphisms.
   Methods: Five PAX1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci were genotyped in 480 northern Chinese Han AIS patients and 841 controls. A stratified genotype-phenotype correlation analysis was conducted based on positive SNP loci and the Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) classification system. Luciferase assays were performed to determine the regulation of PAX1 transcriptional activity.
   Results: The A allele of rs17861031 and the G allele of rs6137473 were significantly associated with AIS [p = 0.05 and 3.12 x 10(-3), odds ratio (OR) = 0.78 and 1.30, respectively]. Moreover, rs17861031 may regulate the PAX1 gene. The A allele of rs17861031 was identified as a risk allele for PUMC type I AIS (p = 0.03), and the G allele of rs6137473 was identified as a risk allele for PUMC type II AIS (p = 1.90 x 10(-3)).
   Conclusions: Both rs17861031 and rs6137473 were significantly associated with AIS and different PUMC classifications of AIS in a northern Chinese Han population.

AB Exosomes may represent an interesting antigenic pulse for new forms of anti-tumor immunotherapy. We evaluated exosomes from serum of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as an antigenic source for dendritic cells (DC) and the effects upon antitumor cytotoxicity, assessed by the percentage of specific lysis of K562 leukemic cells in co-cultures. Surprisingly, incubation of exosomes with DCs decreased lysis of K562, which may correspond to a mechanism of tumor evasion in vivo. However, when immature DCs were pulsed with exosomes purified from K562 culture supernatants, the lysis of target cells was notably enhanced, associated with a substantial increase in the expression of the maturation marker CD83. Thus, the development of vaccines using patients' exosomes would probably add no benefits to the treatment of AML; alternately, exosomes from cultured cells may represent an effective way for maturing DCs into a cytotoxic phenotype, without the immunosuppression observed with patients' exosomes.

AB Recent yellow fever (YF) outbreaks have highlighted the increasing global risk of urban spread of the disease. In context of recurrent vaccine shortages, preventive vaccination activities require accurate estimates of existing population-level immunity. We present POLICI (POpulation-Level Immunization Coverage - Imperial), an interactive online tool for visualising and extracting YF vaccination coverage estimates in Africa.
   We calculated single year age-disaggregated sub-national population-level vaccination coverage for 1950-2050 across the African endemic zone by collating vaccination information and inputting it into a demographic model. This was then implemented on an open interactive web platform.
   POLICI interactively displays age-disaggregated, population-level vaccination coverages at the first sub-national administrative level, through numerous downloadable and customisable visualisations. POLICI is available at https://polici.shinyapps.io/yellow_fever_africa/.
   POLICI offers an accessible platform for relevant stakeholders in global health to access and explore vaccination coverages. These estimates have already been used to inform the WHO strategy to Eliminate Yellow fever Epidemics (EYE). (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Attenuated recombinant Vibrio cholerae 01 vaccine strain CVD 103-HgR elicits a rapid serum vibriocidal antibody (SVA) response and protects against cholera diarrhea in volunteer challenge studies but has not been studied in older adults. We evaluated CVD 103-HgR (PXVX0200) in adults age 46-64, compared them to previously studied adults age 18-45, and studied age-related immunogenicity across adults 18-64 years of age. Volunteers were randomized to receive a single dose of 1 x 10(9) CFU of PXVX0200 or placebo. Immunogenicity endpoints included SVA and anti-cholera toxin (CT) antibody levels on days 1, 11, 29, 91 and 181 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CT-specific IgA and IgG memory B cells on days 1, 91 and 181. Safety was assessed by comparing solicited signs and symptoms on days 1-8 and other adverse events through day 181. 2979 volunteers received vaccine, including 291 age 45-64. Day 11 seroconversion occurred in 90.4% of older adults vs 93.5%% of younger adults and met the endpoint of demonstrating non-inferiority between the two groups. Significant increases in LPS-specific IgG and IgA and CT-specific memory IgG memory B cells were seen at days 91 and 181. There appeared to be a continuous age-related decline in SVA seroconversion and geometric mean titers, but not memory B cell responses, across the 18-64 year age range. Most reactogenicity was mild and was more common in the placebo group. PXVX0200 appears safe and immunogenic in older adults. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Understanding people's perceptions of the economic benefits of a potential Zika vaccine (ZV) is critical to accelerating its introduction into either public sector programs or private market. The aim of this study was to assess the acceptance and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a hypothetical ZV and the associated explanatory variables in Indonesia.
   Methods: We conducted a health facility-based cross-sectional study in Aceh and West Sumatra province from 1 February to 13 June 2018. Patients who visited outpatient departments, have had children or were expecting their first child, were approached and interviewed to collect information on acceptance, WTP, demographic and socio-economic variables and attitudes towards childhood vaccines. Associations of explanatory variables influencing acceptance and WTP were assessed using logistic regression and linear regression analysis, respectively.
   Results: In total, 956 respondents were included in the final analysis of acceptance, of whom 338 (353%) expressed their WTP. We found that 757 (79.1%) of the respondents were likely to be vaccinated and to recommend their partner to be vaccinated. Higher educational attainment, having a job, having heard about Zika and a good attitude towards childhood vaccination were associated with ZV acceptance in the univariate analyses. In the multivariate analysis, attitude towards childhood vaccination was the strongest predictor for ZV vaccination. We found the geometric mean and median of WTP was US$ 13.1 (95% CI: 11.37-15.09) and US$ 7.0 (95% CI: 4.47-10.98), respectively. In the final model, having heard about Zika, having a job, and higher income were associated with a higher WTP.
   Conclusion: Although the acceptance rate of the ZV is relatively high in Indonesia, less than 40% of respondents are willing to pay, underscoring the need for a low-cost, high-quality vaccine and public sector subsidies for Zika vaccinations in the country.

AB Introduction: Rotavirus vaccine was introduced in Mauritania in December 2014. We investigated hospitalizations with diarrhea during pre and post-vaccination periods among children aged 0-5 years in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of hospital admission registries from November 1st 2012 through October 31th 2017 at all referral hospitals in Nouakchott. We described admissions of children aged 0-5 years by diagnosis, data of admission, age and sex, and compared the proportion of all childhood hospitalizations with diarrhea before and after rotavirus vaccine introduction.
   Results: In total, 6552 (19%) of all 34,329 hospitalizations in 0-5 year-olds had diarrhea. Of these, 3523/16,952 (20.7%) were recorded during the pre-vaccine period, 1373/6897 (19.9%) during the transition period (November 2014-October 2015), and 1656/10,480 (15.8%) during the post-vaccination period. The proportion of all childhood hospitalizations with diarrhea during the pre-vaccine period was 22.6% among males and 18.7% among females. Approximately one third (32.3%) of hospitalizations with diarrhea occurred in children aged 6-11 months. During the post-vaccination period, the proportion of hospitalizations with diarrhea declined by 24%, and the highest reduction (74%) was observed in children aged 2 to 5 years (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: The proportion of childhood hospitalizations with diarrhea in Nouakchott was reduced by about one fourth after introduction of rotavirus vaccination in Mauritania, indicating a major impact for public health for children in the capital city.

AB Background and Aim: Vaccine against hepatitis B virus (HBV) is highly effective in preventing HBV infection. The aims of this study were to (1) increase the epidemiological knowledge on the impact of HBV in Tuscany region prisons by registering the results of serum screening on a clinical medical record and (2) increase the anti-HBV vaccination using an accelerated schedule.
   Methods: Our study population was composed of all detainees present in prisons and all constrained from freedom or at institutions in the Tuscany region and not vaccinated at these facilities from 1 December 2016 to 31 May 2017.
   Results: Of 17 detention facilities in the Tuscany region, 15 were enrolled in the study. On 28 February 2017, there were 3068 detainees present in these institutions. Considering the 1075 subjects screened for HBV serum markers, 730 (67.9%) were susceptible to infection and needed to be vaccinated. Five hundred and ninety-six agreed to be vaccinated (82%); 27 (2.5%) of our subjects had an isolated anti-HBc, 20 (1.9%) were HBV infected (HBsAg+), 127 (11.8%) had previous HBV infection (anti-HBs+, anti-HBc+ and HBsAg), and 171 had been previously vaccinated. Five hundred and fifty-five inmates (95.1%) received the first vaccine dose, and 404 (83%) underwent the third dose at day 21.
   Conclusion: This study showed that of a high percentage of subjects who underwent screening, more than half needed to be vaccinated. Moreover, our study reached very high levels of vaccination coverage, considering both the entire enrolled population and the new inmates. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The trimeric HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) is critical for vaccine development aimed at achieving broadly-neutralizing antibody responses. The use of various recombinant expression systems and construct designs are associated with the resultant nature of produced proteins, especially in terms of glycosylation, antigenicity, and immunogenicity of the glycoprotein. Here, we explored an otherwise baculovirus cassette than classical one designed to express HIV-1 Env protein, including SOSIP mutation and Foldon moiety involvement. This improved design increased the ratio of the Env trimer fraction from similar to 40% to similar to 60% with respect to that of prototypical design, as indicated by high-performance size exclusion chromatography and sedimentation velocity analysis. In addition, the design prolonged cell viability and enhanced the final yield (approximately 13-15 mg/L) after affinity purification. gp140 produced from insect cells mimicked the native-like trimer and mainly adopted glycosylation pattern of oligomannose glycans. The native-like Env proteins conferred cross-clade neutralizing antibody production in BALB/c mice. In summary, the expression of Env in insect cells by optimizing the baculovirus vector provides an alternative strategy for HIV-1 immunogen production and may benefit future Env-based HIV vaccine design.

DE Immunization competencies; Global health; Health workforce; Workforce

AB Despite global support for immunization as a core component of the human right to health and the maturity of immunization programs in low- and middle-income countries throughout the world, there is no comprehensive description of the standardized competencies needed for immunization programs at the national, multiple sub-national, and community levels. The lack of defined and standardized competencies means countries have few guidelines to help them address immunization workforce planning, program management, and performance monitoring. Potential consequences resulting from the lack of defined competencies include inadequate or inefficient distribution of resources to support the required functions and difficulties in adequately managing the health workforce. In 2015, an international multi agency working group convened to define standardized competencies that national immunization programs could adapt for their own workforce planning needs. The working group used a stepwise approach to ensure that the competencies would align with immunization programs' objectives. The first step defined the attributes of a successful immunization program. The group then defined the work functions needed to achieve those attributes. Based on the work functions, the working group defined specific competencies. This process resulted in three products: (1) Attributes of an immunization program described within eight technical domains at four levels within a health system: National, Provincial, District/Local, and Community; (2) 229 distinct functions within those eight domains at each of the four levels; and (3) 242 competencies, representing eight technical domains and two foundational domains (Management and Leadership and Vaccine Preventable Diseases and Program). Currently available as a working draft and being tested with immunization projects in several countries, the final document will be published by WHO as normative guidelines. Vertical immunization programs as well as integrated systems can customize the framework to suit their needs. Standardized competencies can support immunization program improvements and help strengthen effective health systems. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: Few studies have reported on the epidemiological characteristics of pediatric primary intussusception in the pre-rotavirus vaccine era of China. It is important to complementary baseline data before rotavirus vaccine introduction in China. This study conduct a retrospective investigation and evaluated the incidence rate, described the epidemiology of pediatric primary intussusception aged <= 24 months.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective investigation in all secondary- and tertiary-hospitals in Jinan. Pediatric primary intussusception inpatients aged <= 24 months were identified depending on ICD-10 discharge code from a total of 63 hospitals from 2011 to 2015. Demographic and clinical information were extracting from the electronic clinical record systems.
   Results: A total of 575 pediatric primary intussusception inpatients were identified with average annual incidence of 86.5 per 100,000. A significantly higher incidence was observed in males (chi(2) = 13.8, P < 0.01), in the <= 12 months old age group (chi(2) = 19.5, P < 0.01) and from the urban areas (chi(2) = 63.31, P < 0.001). No clear seasonality found. Abdominal pain (80.9%) and vomiting (63.3%) were the most frequently reported. Most intussusception cases occurred in ileo-cecum. Over 92% of intussusception cases were diagnosed by ultrasound alone and 77.4% was successfully treated by air enema. 99.7% were cured. The median time of hospitalization was 2 days (range: 0-35 days).
   Conclusion: This retrospective study provides baseline information of incidence, epidemiologyand clinical characteristics of pediatric primary intussusception in Jinan City during 2011-2016 before the introduction of rotavirus vaccine. It will be important for evaluating safety of rotavirus vaccine if it will be introduced to the routine immunization program in China. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Immunization of children with vaccines against Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella (MMRV) is practiced globally with varied recommendations. In India, measles vaccine is administered alone or as MMR at 9 months age. Varicella vaccine is not routinely used. Immunization age is a function of disappearance of maternal antibodies and natural exposure of the children to the pathogens. In view of the measles-WHO-initiative, we aimed to assess if the current immunization age for measles is still valid. In addition, the kinetics of IgG and IgM antibodies against rubella, mumps and varicella viruses was also examined.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Pune, India. A total of 600 children, 150 each in 6-month/9-month (no vaccination) and 12-month/15-month (minimum 4 weeks post-measles-vaccine) cohorts were included. History of these infections and birth status (term/preterm) was recorded. All serum samples were screened for IgG-anti-MMRV-antibodies while IgG-positives were tested for specific IgM antibodies (ELISA).
   Results: At 6-months, the prevalence of MMRV antibodies was 4.7%, 2.7%, 10.7%, 5.3% respectively depicting disappearance of maternal antibodies in majority of the children. Birth status did not influence antibody positivity. Despite vaccination at similar to 9-months, >25% children were still susceptible to measles virus at the age of 12/15-months. The ratio of clinical:subclinical infections was 4:10 (measles) and 12:1 (varicella). All the mumps/rubella IgM positives (1 and 2 respectively) represented subclinical infections.
   Conclusion: Demonstration of early disappearance of maternal antibodies against MMRV viruses leading to the risk of these infections at an early age emphasize need for early immunization of Indian children. Suboptimal response to measles vaccine needs to be seriously addressed especially in view of the WHO's initiative for measles eradication. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The impact of influenza in children under 5 can be severe and fatal. However, the influenza vaccination uptake in China remains suboptimal. The objectives of this study were to investigate parents' perceptions on influenza vaccination and to assess vaccination promotional factors.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey among 1506 parents with children in kindergarten was conducted in two areas with different policies: self-paid vaccination and free vaccination. The questionnaire was based on the structure of the Health Belief Model (HBM). Multiple logistic regression was used to analyze the determinants of parental vaccination intention. Odds ratios (OR) and respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) are reported.
   Results: Within the free policy group versus the non-free group, vaccination intention rates were 76.3% versus 83.4%, and vaccination rates were 34.2% versus 3.1%. Results from multivariate analysis showed that parents with high scores for perceived susceptibility (OR = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.09-1.91), perceived benefits (OR = 1.80; 95% CI: 130-2.50) and cues to action (OR = 3.32; 95% CI: 2.47-4.46) were more likely to get their children vaccinated, while those perceived more barriers (OR = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.37-0.68) had lower vaccination intention. More knowledge (OR = 1.74; 95% CI: 1.18-2.56) and preferable attitudes (higher perceived necessity: OR = 1.84; 95% CI: 1.53-2.22; less safety worry: OR = 1.35; 95% CI: 1.10-1.66) were associated with significantly higher vaccination intention. Adjusted for parents' gender, age, education, income and children's age, the same significant factors were found. Parental intention was found to be influenced by different vaccination policies. Under a free policy, past influenza vaccination uptake (OR = 4.52; 95% CI: 1.07-19.02) greatly promoted parents' willingness to vaccinate their children.
   Conclusion: Parents had high intention to get their kindergarten children vaccinated with the influenza vaccine in spite of the low uptake rate. Our results indicate that offering free influenza vaccines and parental education over the next years may increase the influenza vaccination rate. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Seasonal and pandemic influenza infections remain a serious public health concern. Many health authorities recommend annual vaccination as the most effective way to control influenza infection. Accordingly, regulatory guidelines ask vaccine manufacturers to determine vaccine potency at the time of release and throughout shelf-life to ensure vaccine quality. The potency of inactivated influenza vaccine is related to the quantity of hemagglutinin (HA). Since 1970s, single radial immunodiffusion (SRID) assay has been standardly used for the quantitation of HA in influenza vaccine. However, SRID is labor-intensive, inaccurate, and requires standard reference reagents that should be updated annually. Therefore, there have been extensive efforts to develop alternative potency assays. In this study, we developed and tested a new HA quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a universal monoclonal antibody that can bind to HAs from various subtypes in group 1 influenza A virus (IAV). We analyzed the conserved stalk domain of HA via a library approach to design a consensus HA antigen for group 1 IAV. The antigens were expressed as a soluble form in E. coli and were purified by Ni-affinity chromatography. When tested with variety of HAs from lAVs or influenza B viruses (IBVs), the mAbs exhibited specific binding to group 1 HAs, with potential exception to H9 subtype. Among various conditions of pH, urea, and reducing agents, pretreatment of HA at low pH exposing the conserved stalk domain was crucially important for optimal ELISA performance. Calibration curves for various HAs were generated to determine accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and linear dynamic range. The ELISA method shows high sensitivity and accuracy compared with the SRID assay. The HA group specific universal mAbs against the consensus stalk domain of HA are conducive to establishing an ELISA-based standard procedure for the quantitation of HA antigens for annual vaccination against influenza infection.

AB Background: Hepatitis A virus (HAV) causes acute liver infection and is spread through the fecal-oral route. Travel to countries in HAV-endemic regions (e.g., Asia and Latin America) is a well-described risk factor for infection. Currently, Ontario publicly funds hepatitis A vaccination for some populations at high risk of HAV infection but not for all travellers to endemic countries. The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of expanding publicly funded HAV vaccination to people planning travel to HAV-endemic regions, from the Ontario healthcare payer perspective.
   Methods: We conducted a cost-utility analysis comparing an expanded high-risk publicly-funded hepatitis A vaccination program including funded vaccine for travellers to endemic regions to the current high risk program in Ontario. A Markov state transition model was developed, including six possible health states. Model parameters were informed through targeted literature searches and included hepatitis A disease probabilities, utilities associated with health states, health system expenditures, and vaccine costs. Future costs and health outcomes were discounted at 1.5%. Primary outcomes included cost, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) over a lifetime time horizon. We conducted one-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
   Results: The expanded high risk HAV vaccine program provided few incremental health gains in the travel population (mean 0.000037 QALYs/person), at an incremental cost of $124.31. The ICER of the expanded program compared to status quo is $3,391,504/QALY gained. The conclusion of the model was robust to changes in key parameters across reasonable ranges.
   Conclusions: The expanded vaccination program substantially exceeds commonly accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds. Further research concerning possible cost-effective implementation of high risk travel hepatitis A vaccination should focus on a more integrated understanding of the risk of acquiring hepatitis A during travel to endemic regions (e.g., purpose, length of stay).

AB Background: The fast-growing population of immunocompromised patients (ICP) is more vulnerable to infectious diseases, demanding strategies to protect them. These strategies seem inconsistent in available guidelines and in practices. We aim to evaluate healthcare professionals' (HCP) opinions on vaccination to reduce the number and severity of infections in ICP.
   Methods: A mixed-method study, with an exploratory sequential design, was performed. Medical specialists from various departments in a tertiary care center in the Netherlands were invited for semi structured interviews to explore their perspective on preventive care of ICP. Topics that play a substantial role in daily practice for ICP were translated into a survey to gain insight into what extent opinions were generalizable to Erasmus Medical Center.
   Results: Surveys were completed by 689 HCP (43% of the invitees), 269 of them treated at least two ICP weekly on average and were considered eligible for further analysis. Quantitative data showed that according to 80 percent of HCP, preventive care for ICP can be improved. Education was chosen by 40 percent as the most important intervention to reduce the number and severity of infections. Vaccinations were valued as important by seventeen percent of HCP. Except for influenza, vaccinations were not regularly discussed during routine consultations. Difficulties to administer vaccinations were experienced by 75 percent of HCP.
   Conclusion: According to our respondents, education is the most promising intervention to reduce the number and severity of infections in ICP. To reach a higher vaccine uptake, we recommend HCP to address vaccinations more frequently during consultations and to search for solutions to alleviate barriers to vaccinate. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Background: Observational studies of the relative effectiveness of influenza vaccines are essential for public health decision making. Their estimates, however, are subject to bias due to unmeasured confounders. Instrumental variable (IV) methods can control for observed and unobserved confounders.
   Methods: We used linked electronic medical record databases in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) as well as Medicare administrative files to examine the relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of high-dose influenza vaccine (HD) versus standard-dose influenza vaccines (SD) in preventing hospitalizations among VHA-enrolled Veterans >= 65 years of age during 5 influenza seasons (2010-2011 through 2014-2015). Using multivariable IV Poisson regression modeling to address unmeasured confounding and bias, we analyzed the data by each season and through longitudinal analysis of all five seasons.
   Findings: We included 3,638,924 person-influenza seasons of observation where 158,636 (4%) were among HD vaccine recipients and 3,480,288 (96%) were among SD vaccine recipients. Of the 1,728,562 Veterans, 1,702,824 (98.5%) were male and 1,299,412 (75%) were non-Hispanic white. Based on the longitudinal analysis of all five seasons, the IV-adjusted rVE estimate of HD vs. SD was 10% (95% CI, 8-12%) against all-cause hospitalization; 18% (95% CI, 15-21%) against cardiorespiratory-associated hospitalization; and 14% (95% CI, 6-22%) against influenza/pneumonia-associated hospitalization. The findings by season were similar.
   Interpretation: Our analysis of VHA clinical data collected from approximately 1.7 million Veterans 65 years and older during five seasons demonstrates that high-dose influenza vaccine is more effective than standard-dose influenza vaccines in preventing influenza- or pneumonia-associated hospitalizations, cardiorespiratory hospitalizations, and all-cause hospitalizations.

   the opposition to vaccination and threats to public health
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Anti-vaccine movement; Political populism; Social media; Public health;
   Eastern Europe
AB The article analyses the cultural and political contexts of the revival of the anti-vaccine movement in Poland. According to the authors, the attempt to institutionalise and politicise anti-vaccine activists is part of the wider phenomenon of political populism in Eastern Europe. The attempt to abolish compulsory vaccinations, which is supported by right-wing populists, shows that the anti-Enlightenment and anti-Western shift in the public sphere in Eastern Europe can also affect the area of health protection. Western pharmaceutical concerns may be the same target of populist attacks as refugees and migrants. The authors claim that, like in the case of political nationalism, a widespread educational campaign and bottom-up social legal and political measures need to be implemented to combat disinformation about vaccination.

TI Perceptions and acceptability of an experimental Ebola vaccine among

AB Introduction: Experimental Ebola vaccines were introduced during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Planning for the Sierra Leone Trial to Introduce a Vaccine against Ebola (STRIVE) was under-way in late 2014. We examined hypothetical acceptability and perceptions of experimental Ebola vaccines among health care workers (HCWs), frontline workers, and the general public to guide ethical communication of risks and benefits of any experimental Ebola vaccine.
   Methods: Between December 2014 and January 2015, we conducted in-depth interviews with public health leaders (N = 31), focus groups with HCWs and frontline workers (N = 20), and focus groups with members of the general public (N = 15) in Western Area Urban, Western Area Rural, Port Loko, Bombali, and Tonkolili districts. Themes were identified using qualitative content analysis.
   Results: Across all participant groups, not knowing the immediate and long-term effects of an experimental Ebola vaccine was the most serious concern. Some respondents feared that experimental vaccines may cause Ebola, lead to death, or result in other adverse events. Among HCWs, not knowing the level of protection provided by experimental Ebola vaccines was another concern. HCWs and frontline workers were motivated to help find a vaccine for Ebola to help end the outbreak. General public participants cited positive experiences with routine childhood immunization in Sierra Leone.
   Discussion: Our formative assessment prior to STRIVE's implementation in Sierra Leone helped identify concerns, motivations, and information gaps among potential participants of an experimental Ebola vaccine trial, at the time when an unprecedented outbreak was occurring in the country. The findings from this assessment were incorporated early in the process to guide ethical communication of risks and benefits when discussing informed consent for possible participation in the vaccine trial that was launched later in 2015.

AB We previously developed an highly efficacious combination adjuvant comprised of innate defense regulator (IDR)-1002 peptide, poly(I:C) and polyphosphazene (TriAdj). Here we aimed to design and test the in vivo efficacy of a mucoadhesive nasal formulation of this adjuvant. To determine the physical properties of the formulation, the effect of addition of each individual component was characterised by gel electrophoresis and fluorescence quenching using rhodamine-poly(I:C). Cationic liposomes comprised of didodecyl dimethylammonium bromide (DDAB), dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) (50:50 or 75:25 mol:mol) and DDAB, L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine (egg PC) and DOPE (40:50:10 mol:mol:mol;) were prepared by the thin-film extrusion method. The liposomes and TriAdj were combined by simple mixing. The formed complex (L-TriAdj) was characterized by dynamic light scattering, zeta potential, and mucin interactions. We found that IDR-1002 peptide, polyphosphazene and poly(I:C) self-assembled in solution forming an anionic complex. Exposure of RAW267.4 mouse macrophage cells to TriAdj alone vs. L-TriAdj indicated that DDAB/DOPE (50:50) and DDAB/EPC/cholesterol (40:50:10) complexation reduced TriAdj toxicity. Next, TriAdj-containing cationic liposomes were prepared at several molar ratios to determine optimal size, stability and desired positive charge. Transmission electron microscopy showed rearrangement of lipid structures on binding of liposomes to TriAdj and to mucin. Stable particles (<200 nm over 24 h) showed mucin binding of DDAB/DOPE + TriAdj was greater than DDAB/EPC/DOPE + TriAdj. To verify in vivo efficacy, mice were administered the DDAB/DOPE + TriAdj complex intranasally with ovalbumin as the antigen, and the immunogenic response was measured by ELISA (serum IgG1 IgG2a, IgA) and ELISpot assays (splenocyte IL-5, IFN-gamma). Mice administered adjuvant showed a significantly greater immune response with L-TriAdj than TriAdj alone, with a dose-response proportionate to the triple adjuvant content, and an overall balanced Th1/Th2 immune response representing both systemic and mucosal immunity.

AB Background: Trivalent adjuvanted influenza vaccine (aIIV3; Fluad (R)) was approved in the United States (U.S.) in 2015 for adults aged >= 65 years and has been in use since the 2016-17 influenza season.
   Methods: We analyzed U.S. reports for aIIV3 submitted from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2018 to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a national spontaneous reporting system. Medical records were reviewed for serious reports. Among individuals >= 65 years of age, the relative frequency of the most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) after aIIV3 were compared with non-adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccines given to adults aged >= 65 years, high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine (IIV3-HD) and trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines (IIV3/IIV4). Data mining analyses were undertaken to identify whether AEs for aIIV3 occurred disproportionately more than expected compared to all influenza vaccines.
   Results: VAERS received 630 reports after aIIV3, of which 521 (83%) were in adults aged >= 65 years; 79 (13%) in persons <65 years and in 30 (5%) reports age was missing; 19 (3%) reports were serious, including two deaths (0.4%) related to myocardial infarction and Sjogren's syndrome. The most common AEs reported in adults aged >= 65 years were injection site pain (21%) and erythema (18%), with similar proportions reported for IIV3-HD (17% and 19%, respectively) and for IIV3/IIV4 (15%, each). Except for reports related to vaccination of inappropriate age (n = 79) and syringe malfunction (n = 6), data mining did not identify other disproportionately reported AEs.
   Conclusions: Although our review of aIIV3 in VAERS did not identify any unexpected health conditions of concern, we observed more than twice the expected number of reports with administration of the vaccine to persons outside of the age range for which the vaccine is approved in the U.S. Health care providers should be educated on the age groups for whom aIIV3 is recommended.

   A: A comparison of two outbreaks in England
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Hepatitis A; Outbreak; Community; School; Vaccination
ID WIDE OUTBREAK; PREVALENCE; DISEASE
AB In August 2015 two community outbreaks of hepatitis A virus (HAV) occurred in sub-urban communities in Northern England. Each was managed by an independent outbreak control team. In outbreak one, mass vaccination was deployed targeting a residential area and two schools, while in outbreak two, vaccination was reserved for household-type contacts of cases. The highest vaccination uptake was achieved in the school settings (82% and 95%). These case studies illustrate the range of approaches that can be used and the factors that influence decision-making in response to a hepatitis A community outbreak. Both outbreaks likely started from importation(s) of HAV by returning travellers and spread through extended social networks and the local community. Vaccination strategies were selected based on hypotheses about transmission pathways, which were informed by evidence from oral fluid (OF) testing of asymptomatic contacts. More evidence about the effectiveness of mass vaccination in community outbreaks of hepatitis A in low endemicity settings is needed. Hepatitis A guidelines should include recommendations for the use of mass vaccination and OF testing in outbreaks. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID PREVENTION; CHILDREN
AB Background: It has been hypothesized that widespread implementation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (PCV) in infancy reduces early AOM and thereby prevents further AOM episodes and associated health care resource use.
   Methods: We tested this hypothesis by applying an extension of the original Cox proportional hazards model (Prentice, Williams and Petersons' total time) to individual AOM episodes recorded in pseudonymised primary care electronic health records of 18,237 Dutch children born between 2004 and 2015. Children were assigned to three groups: no-PCV (January 2004-March 2006), PCV7 (April 2006 February 2011) and PCV10 (March 2011-February 2015).
   Results: Of the 18,237 newborns, 6967 (38%) experienced at least one GP-diagnosed AOM episode up to the age of four years (median age at first AOM: 12 months, interquartile range: 12; total number of AOM episodes: 14,689). Time-to-first AOM was longest in the PCV10 group compared with the PCV7 and no-PCV groups (log rank test: P < 0.001); in these groups 30% had experienced a first AOM at 20, 17 and 15 months, respectively. Children in the PCV10 group had a 21% lower risk of experiencing a first AOM episode than those in the no-PCV group (hazard ratio (HR): 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72-0.86), while the effect was less pronounced for the PCV7 group (HR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.87-1.02). Neither PCV7 nor PCV10 reduced the risk of AOM recurrences. Compared to no-PCV, HRs for overall AOM were 1.00 (95% CI: 0.95-1.06) and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.84-0.95) for PCV7 and PCV10, respectively.
   Conclusion: Our cohort study suggests that PCV postpones the onset and reduces the risk of first AOM without affecting recurrences. The impact of PCV on overall AOM in children up to the age of four years seems therefore largely attributable to the prevention of a first AOM episode. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Influenza A virus in swine (IAV-S) is an important pathogen in pigs in the United States, in addition to posing a potential risk to humans through zoonotic events. Intervention strategies continue to be explored to better control virus circulation. Improved surveillance efforts has led to significantly increased sequence data available on circulating strains, vastly improving our understanding of the genetic and antigenic diversity of IAV-S. IAV-S in North America is characterized by repeated spillover events of human viruses into pigs followed by genetic and antigenic diversification. An important gap that needs to be addressed is our understanding of the role that various vaccine platforms have on efficacy against antigenically heterologous challenge. Currently licensed vaccines often update their components to adapt to a dynamic antigenic landscape and newly developed technologies continue to be approved. Hence, it remains critical to test the performance of vaccines against challenge with antigenically distinct viruses. We tested the level of protection conferred by an alphavirus-vectored hemagglutinin (HA) subunit vaccine, delivered as a monovalent or bivalent formulation, against challenge with IAV-S. Monovalent alphavirus-vectored HA vaccines provided efficient protection against challenge with viruses with matched and mismatched HA, although in one mismatched HA challenge group there was a trend for reduced protection. A bivalent vaccine, in which two HA's were simultaneously delivered, was effective in producing antibody response against both antigens and provided protection against challenge. The alphavirus platform is a promising new technology available to swine producers to help reduce the burden of disease caused by IAV-S. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Polymer dispersed nematic liquid crystal (PDNLC) films with conical boundary conditions at the LC-polymer interface are considered. The conical surface anchoring with tilt angle 40 initiates forming the axial-bipolar director configuration inside nematic droplets. This droplet structure exhibits the strong scattering of light polarized parallel to the bipolar axis. In the initial state, the bipolar axes in all droplets are oriented randomly, and therefore PDNLC film scatters a light of any polarization. Electric field applied along the film plane orients the bipolar axes unidirectionally in the whole droplet ensemble, that results in its high polarization-dependent transmittance. Such PDNLC films can be used in the electrically controllable linear polarizers characterized by 89% value of the transmittance for the perpendicular polarized light and high extinction ratio 590:1 at the electric field 0.34 V/mu m.

AB The paper presents preparation of nanocomposite thin films of three newly synthesized perylene bis azo-imides in polyimide matrix by vapour deposition, results of DFT quantum chemical calculations on the optimized molecular geometry of trans (E) and cis (Z) isomers of the studied dyes as well as photoinduced birefringence measurements to explore potential optical application of these novel materials. Vapour deposited single films of the dyes were studied by reflectance UV-VIS and fluorescence spectroscopy in order to investigate the nature of electron transitions and donor-acceptor interactions between phenylazo fragments and perylene core. The nanocomposite films were prepared through vapour deposition of ODA (4,4'-oxydianiline) and PMDA (pyromellitic dianhydride) as the host polymer matrix and of corresponding perylene bis azo-imide dyes as "guest" at two various concentrations 5 % and 10 % w/w. It was found that nanocomposite films have improved photoresponsivness by applying visible light at lambda = 532 nm compared to the single deposited films of dyes. This study shows the applicability of the synthesized dyes embedded in the polyimide matrix as visible-light activated molecular switches.

The absorption and emission spectra were recorded in visible wavelength range and the decay time of P-3(0) manifold was measured to be about 34.5 mu s at room temperature. Using an InGaN laser diode as pump source, continuous-wave laser operation of Pr:LMA crystal have also been demonstrated in red at about 645 nm and deep red at about 725 nm, which provide new linearly polarized sources for various potential applications.

AB We propose a new approach to directly tune spectral Q-factor of the graphene, which has remained challenging in these years. The remarkable tuning of optical properties is reported by splitting graphene disk resonators. In contrast to the single mode of the circular graphene disk, the split graphene nano-disks produce new emerged plasmonic resonant modes, which can be further modified by tuning structural parameters. Such split graphene nano-disks can not only strengthen the multispectral light-graphene interactions drastically but also improve the spectral Q-factor naturally. The spectral Q-factor shows an enhancement of 230-360% for the proposed split graphene nano-disks in comparison with that of the conventional graphene plasmonic mode. With increasing Fermi energy, the tri-band spectrum shows a further narrowing behavior for the resonant bandwidth. A maximal enhancement similar to 400% for the spectral Q-factor is obtained. Moreover, the graphene plasmonic properties can be artificially modulated by polarization states of the illumination. This study will open up an avenue for effectively operating graphene photonic devices in the infrared range and pave a way for high-Q multispectral plasmonic graphene structures.

AB Polycrystalline powders of K2LaNb5O15 doped with Eu3+ ions were prepared by high temperature solid state reaction. The phase formation of these compounds was monitored by X-ray diffraction measurements. Excitation of the prepared phosphors with near-UV or blue radiation resulted in a bright red luminescence, dominated by D-5(0) -> F-7(2) transition at ca. 613 nm, with excellent colour saturation. The colour coordinates were relatively stable regardless the Eu3+ concentration and temperature. Furthermore, sample doped with 75% Eu3+ showed high 66% quantum efficiency if excited at 394 nm. Temperature dependent photoluminescence and decay measurements showed that internal quantum efficiency of the phosphors decreases slower than the external quantum efficiency at elevated temperatures. Moreover, synthesized K2LaNb5O15:Eu3+ phosphors possess rather unique emission spectra with strong and finely split emission lines originating from the(5)D(0) -> F-7(2) transition (ca.700 nm) what makes these materials very attractive for application in luminescent security pigments.

AB Nowadays the traditional post CdCl2 thermal treatment to Cd-based thin films is an emerging route to improve the crystallinity and to passivate the grain boundaries which results into augmentation in physical properties of absorber layer. Therefore, in this communication an impact of CdCl2 thermal treatment on physical properties of e-beam deposited CdSe absorber layers has been investigated. The XRD results reveal that these films have dominant reflection (111) plane with cubic phase upto 320 degrees C and then cubic phase transformed into hexagonal phase with partial oxidation at higher annealing. The optical absorbance is found to be good and transmittance is observed to be very low in the visible region. Surface topological study indicates that the surface roughness is improved with the treatment while the observed Cd and Se along with Cl peaks in EDAX spectra to elemental analysis confirm the deposition of films and CdCl2 treatment. The ohmic nature of the films is visible in current-voltage behavior within the voltage range of -2 and +2 V. The chloride activated CdSe films processed at 320 degrees C might be anticipated as an efficient absorber-layer for the fabrication of Cd-based solar cells.

AB The frequency response of dielectric permittivity measurements at temperatures 35 degrees C and 100 degrees C suggests enhanced inherent optical quality and few defects in the crystal. The Cole-Cole plot shows the presence of grain and grain boundary, it is found that single relaxation is observed in the crystal. The ac and dc conductivity and dielectric behavior of the grown crystal were systemically investigated as a function of frequency and temperature. The third order nonlinear optical property extensively studied by z-scan technique revealed high third order nonlinearity in the form of self-defocusing and two-photon absorption with saturable absorption. The strong intermolecular charge transfer interaction evident from NBO and AIM studies confirms the NLO property of the material. The detailed vibrational assignments were carried out on the basis of potential energy distribution (PED) analysis and scaled quantum mechanical force field calculation using MOLVIB program. The red shifted NH stretching wavenumbers and the broadening of corresponding bands in the solid state as well as the gas phase spectra, optimized molecular geometry and NBO analysis have confirmed the presence of N-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonding in G4AB.

AB Ce- and Eu-doped Ca2MgSi2O7 (CMSM) single crystals were synthesized by the Floating Zone method. From the X-ray diffraction patterns, we confirmed that all the CMSM samples have no impurity phases. Under X-ray irradiation, the Ce- and Eu-doped CMSM samples showed scintillation with a broad emission around 390 nm and 530 nm, respectively. The origin of these emissions was considered to be the 5d-4f transitions of Ce3+ and Eu2+, respectively. The absolute light yield of the Eu-doped CMSM sample was 11,000 ph/MeV evaluated under Am-241 gamma-ray (59.5 keV). In addition, afterglow properties of the Ce- and Eu-doped samples were consistent with the corresponding thermoluminescence properties.

AB Stupendous progress in realizing optical materials is due to extreme strides which were adapted so far in understanding optical properties of materials. Keeping this in view a series of Bismuth Borosilicate glasses modified with strontium and doped with various concentrations of Sm3+ (SrO-Bi2O3-B2O3 -SiO2-Sm2O3) have been prepared by classical melt quench technique. These glasses were structurally characterized by XRD to confirm amorphous nature. Vibration mode analysis of samples has been analyzed by infrared transmission spectroscopy. This paper show cases various optical phenomena such as absorption and luminescence which plays a key role in design of engineered optical materials. To understand absorption, optical excitation, emission and time decay process optical spectroscopy measurements were done. Judd-Ofelt (JO) theory was employed to determine intensity parameters Omega(lambda= 2,4,6) for symmetry of ligand environment existing among Sin(3+) ions. From emission spectra various radiative parameters like transition probability (A(r)), branching ratios (beta(r)) and radiative time were determined. Emission bands of (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(5/2) (560 nm), (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(7/2) (599 nm) (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(9/2) (636 nm) and (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(11/2) (708 nm) have been recorded with excitation at 401 nm. Above all emission wavelengths 599 rim is more intense and has shown a bright orange emission. Among four emission bands corresponding to (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(7/2) transition in emission spectra shows high (sigma(E)) peak stimulated emission (22.85 x 10(-22) cm(2)) and optical gain (O.G) is (28.33 x 10(-25) cm(2)s) assure optoelectronic applications. The life time tau( exp )of excited level (4)G(5/2) was determined through decay and non-exponential decay curves. Inokuti-Hirayama model was used to fit non exponential curve for the analysis of luminescence quenching, quantum efficiency (96%), transfer mechanism of energy among Sin(3+) ions to ensure Laser applications. CIE colour chromaticity coordinates of present Sm3+ doped glasses also suggest the synthesized glasses are suitable improvement of orange-red lasers.

AB The multifunctional chitosan films are fabricated by doping of 5-[4-(benzyloxy)phenyl]-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-amine (BOPDXD) and 2-([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-5-[(4-bromophenyl)methyl]-1,3,4-oxadiazole (BPHOXD), by solvent intercalation method. The doping is confirmed by FTIR, SEM and EDS data. The dopant molecules are dispersed as micro and macrocystals in the chitosan matrix. The dopant BOPDXD encapsulated into chitosan matrix by intermolecular H-bonding resulted in red shift (261 nm-340 nm) of lambda(max). The crystallinity of the doped films increased in dose-dependent manner. The band gap energy lowered to an extent of 1.93eV (4wt %) and 1.84eV (6wt %) for BOPDXD and BPHOXD respectively which is comparable with known semiconductors like TiO2 and CdSe etc. The change observed in calculated refractive index, dielectric constant, optical conductivity from UV data evidenced interaction of the dopants with the matrix. The non-luminescent films turned out to be excellent photoluminescent materials on doping; with maximum intensity at 4wt% dopant concentration for both the dopants. The predicted absolute quantum yield for the chitosan BOPDXD films obtained in a range of 16.28%-31.48% and for the chitosan- BPHOXD films in the range of 24.35%-38.61%.
