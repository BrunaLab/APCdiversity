AB We report herein, a one-pot synthetic route for the synthesis of Au/CeO2 nanocomposite and studied its catalytic activity as a recyclable and efficient photocatalyst for visible light esterification from aldehydes at room temperatures. The catalyst was characterised by XRD, SEM, TEM, Mapping, EDX, XPS, ICP-AES and BET-surface area analysis. It was observed that 5-10 nm Au-nanoparticles supported on 20-30 nm CeO2 nanoparticles with a gold loading of 1 wt% shows high conversion and selectivity towards the target product ester. The efficiencies of the photocatalytic activity depend on the Au loading and synergistic effect between the surface Au and CeO2 nanoparticles. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The rotating shallow water (RSW) equations are the usual testbed for the development of numerical methods for three-dimensional atmospheric and oceanic models. However, an arguably more useful set of equations are the thermal shallow water equations (TSW), which introduce an additional thermodynamic scalar but retain the single layer, two-dimensional structure of the RSW. As a stepping stone towards a three-dimensional atmospheric dynamical core, this work presents a quasi-Hamiltonian discretization of the thermal shallow water equations using compatible Galerkin methods, building on previous work done for the shallow water equations. Structure-preserving or quasi-Hamiltonian discretizations methods, that discretize the Hamiltonian structure of the equations of motion rather than the equations of motion themselves, have proven to be a powerful tool for the development of models with discrete conservation properties. By combining these ideas with an energy-conserving Poisson time integrator and a careful choice of Galerkin spaces, a large set of desirable properties can be achieved. In particular, for the first time total mass, buoyancy and energy are conserved to machine precision in the fully discrete model. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB For more than half a century, most of the plasma scientists have encountered a violation of the conservation laws of charge, momentum, and energy whenever they have numerically solved the first-principle equations of kinetic plasmas, such as the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system. This fatal problem is brought by the fact that both the Vlasov and Maxwell equations are indirectly associated with the conservation laws by means of some mathematical manipulations. Here we propose a quadratic conservative scheme, which can strictly maintain the conservation laws by discretizing the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system. A discrete product rule and summation-by-parts are the key players in the construction of the quadratic conservative scheme. Numerical experiments of the relativistic two-stream instability and relativistic Weibel instability prove the validity of our computational theory, and the proposed strategy will open the doors to the first-principle studies of mesoscopic and macroscopic plasma physics.

ID LARGE-SCALE MINIMIZATION; PART I; IMPLEMENTATION; ALGORITHMS
AB Data Assimilation (DA) is an uncertainty quantification technique used to incorporate observed data into a prediction model in order to improve numerical forecasted results. Variational DA (VarDA) is based on the minimisation of a function which estimates the discrepancy between numerical results and observations. Operational forecasting requires real-time data assimilation. This mandates the choice of opportune methods to improve the efficiency of VarDA codes without loosing accuracy. Due to the scale of the forecasting area and the number of state variables used to describe the physical model, DA is a big data problem. In this paper, the Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD) is used to reduce the space dimension, alleviate the computational cost and reduce the errors. Nevertheless, a consequence is that important information is lost if the truncation parameter is not properly chosen. We provide an algorithm to compute the optimal truncation parameter and we prove that the optimal estimation reduces the ill-conditioning and removes the statistically less significant modes which could add noise to the estimate obtained from DA. In this paper, numerical issues faced in developing VarDA algorithm include the ill-conditioning of the background covariance matrix, the choice of a preconditioning and the choice of the regularisation parameter. We also show how the choice of the regularisation parameter impacts on the efficiency of the VarDA minimisation computed by the L-BFGS (Limited - Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno). Experimental results are provided for pollutant dispersion within an urban environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A novel Eulerian approach is proposed for numerical simulations of wave propagation in viscoelastic media, for application to shocks interacting with interfaces between fluids and solids. We extend the five-equations multiphase interface-capturing model, based on the idea that all the materials (gases, liquids, solids) obey the same equation of state with spatially varying properties, to incorporate the desired constitutive relation; in this context, interfaces are represented by discontinuities in material properties. We consider problems in which the deformations are small, such that the substances can be described by linear constitutive relations, specifically, Maxwell, Kelvin-Voigt or generalized Zener models. The main challenge lies in representing the combination of viscoelastic, multiphase and compressible flow. One particular difficulty is the calculation of strains in an Eulerian framework, which we address by using a conventional hypoelastic model in which an objective time derivative (Lie derivative) of the constitutive relation is taken to evolve strain rates instead. The resulting eigensystem is analyzed to identify wave speeds and characteristic variables. The spatial scheme is based on a solution-adaptive formulation, in which a discontinuity sensor discriminates between smooth and discontinuous regions. To compute the convective fluxes, explicit high-order central differences are applied in smooth regions, while a high-order finite-difference Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) scheme is used at discontinuities (shocks, material interfaces and contacts). The numerical method is verified in a comprehensive fashion using a series of smooth and discontinuous (shocks and interfaces), one- and two-dimensional test problems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB The generalized method of separation of variables (GMSV) is applied to solve boundary value problems for the Laplace operator in three-dimensional domains with disconnected spherical boundaries (e.g., an arbitrary configuration of non-overlapping partially reactive spherical sinks or obstacles). We consider both exterior and interior problems and all most common boundary conditions: Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and conjugate one. Using the translational addition theorems for solid harmonics to switch between the local spherical coordinates, we obtain a semi-analytical expression of the Green function as a linear combination of partial solutions whose coefficients are fixed by boundary conditions. Although the numerical computation of the coefficients involves series truncation and solution of a system of linear algebraic equations, the use of the solid harmonics as basis functions naturally adapted to the intrinsic symmetries of the problem makes the GMSV particularly efficient, especially for exterior problems. The obtained Green function is the key ingredient to solve boundary value problems and to determine various characteristics of stationary diffusion such as reaction rate, escape probability, harmonic measure, residence time, and mean first passage time, to name but a few. The relevant aspects of the numerical implementation and potential applications in chemical physics, heat transfer, electrostatics, and hydrodynamics are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB This article focuses on numerically studying the eigenstructure behavior of generalized eigenvalue problems (GEPs) arising in three dimensional (3D) source-free Maxwell's equations with magnetoelectric coupling effects which model 3D reciprocal chiral media. It is challenging to solve such a large-scale GEP efficiently. We combine the null-space free method with the inexact shift-invert residual Arnoldi method and MINRES linear solver to solve the GEP with a matrix dimension as large as 5,308,416. The eigenstructure is heavily determined by the chirality parameter gamma. We show that all the eigenvalues are real and finite for a small chirality gamma. For a critical value gamma = gamma*, the GEP has 2 x 2 Jordan blocks at infinity eigenvalues. Numerical results demonstrate that when gamma increases from gamma*, the 2 x 2 Jordan block will first split into a complex conjugate eigenpair, then rapidly collide with the real axis and bifurcate into positive (resonance) and negative eigenvalues with modulus smaller than the other existing positive eigenvalues. The resonance band also exhibits an anticrossing interaction. Moreover, the electric and magnetic fields of the resonance modes are localized inside the structure, with only a slight amount of field leaking into the background (dielectric) material.

AB The purpose of this research is to describe an efficient iterative method suitable for obtaining high accuracy solutions to high frequency time-harmonic scattering problems. The method allows for both refinement of local polynomial degree and non-conforming mesh refinement, including multiple hanging nodes per edge. Rather than globally assemble the finite element system, we describe an iterative domain decomposition method which can use element-wise fast solvers for elements of large degree. Since continuity between elements is enforced through moment equations, the resulting constraint equations are hierarchical. We show that, for high frequency problems, a subset of these constraints should be directly enforced, providing the coarse space in the dual-primal domain decomposition method. The subset of constraints is chosen based on a dispersion criterion involving mesh size and wavenumber. By increasing the size of the coarse space according to this criterion, the number of iterations in the domain decomposition method depends only weakly on the wavenumber. We demonstrate this convergence behaviour on standard domain decomposition test problems and conclude the paper with application of the method to electromagnetic problems in two dimensions. These examples include beam steering by lenses and photonic crystal waveguides, as well as radar cross section computation for dielectric, perfect electric conductor, and electromagnetic cloak scatterers.

AB In numerical simulation of multi-fluid flows, it is very crucial to accurately capture the interface separating the fluids, which has the properties of a contact wave. Since HLLC (Harten Lax van-Leer with contact) formulation has the ability to model contact waves exactly, a novel HLLC-type Riemann solver is proposed for calculation of convective flux in a system where the incompressible-Navier-Stokes equations are tightly coupled with the volume of fluid (VOF) equation. The efficacy of the new formulation is evaluated by solving various standard test problems involving two-fluid flows. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The large computational requirements associated with subsurface flow simulation limit the use of realistic models for demanding applications such as optimization and uncertainty quantification. This has motivated the development of reduced-order models, in particular those based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). In this study, we implement a POD-based Gauss-Newton with approximated tensors (GNAT) method for oil-water reservoir simulation. Our formulation, which is described in detail, incorporates promising features from previous implementations involving GNAT and discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) procedures. A theoretical analysis of the computational cost of GNAT for our problem, and the speedup it may provide relative to the full-order simulation, suggests a complex dependency of speedup on GNAT parameters and solver implementation. Systematic assessments, involving several comprehensive numerical experiments, are then presented. These include a detailed evaluation of GNAT performance on a 2D model, in which 576 different GNAT parameter combinations are considered, which allows us to elucidate the impact of parameter values on error. Detailed comparisons with an existing reduced-order modeling procedure based on trajectory piecewise linearization, POD-TPWL, are also presented. Around 1500 test cases, with varying levels of perturbation relative to training cases, are considered. We show that GNAT is only slightly more accurate than POD-TPWL for cases with small perturbation, but its accuracy advantage increases for larger perturbations. We also demonstrate the successful application of GNAT to a more realistic 3D model. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a class of high order numerical schemes is proposed for solving Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) equations. This work is regarded as an extension of our previous work for nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations, see Christlieb et al. [14], which relies on a special kernel-based formulation of the solutions and successive convolution. When applied to the H-J equations, the newly proposed scheme attains genuinely high order accuracy in both space and time, and more importantly, it is unconditionally stable, hence allowing for much larger time step evolution compared with other explicit schemes and saving computational cost. A high order weighted essentially non-oscillatory methodology and a novel nonlinear filter are further incorporated to capture the correct viscosity solution. Furthermore, by coupling the recently proposed inverse Lax-Wendroff boundary treatment technique, this method is very flexible in handing complex geometry as well as general boundary conditions. We perform numerical experiments on a collection of numerical examples, including H-J equations with linear, nonlinear, convex or non-convex Hamiltonians. The efficacy and efficiency of the proposed scheme in approximating the viscosity solution of general H-J equations is verified. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Acoustical shock waves can be generated by numerous atmospheric sources, either natural - like thunder and volcanoes - or anthropic - like explosions, sonic boom or buzz saw noise. The prediction of their long-range propagation remains a numerical challenge at 3D because of the large propagation distance to wavelength ratio, and of the high frequency/small wavelength content associated to shocks. In this paper, an original numerical method for propagating acoustical shock waves in three-dimensional heterogeneous media is proposed. Heterogeneities can result from temperature or density gradients and also from atmospheric shear and turbulent flows. The method called FLHOWARD (for FLow and Heterogeneities in a One-Way Approximation of the nonlineaR wave equation in 3D) is based on a one-way solution of a generalized nonlinear wave equation. Even though backscattering is neglected, it does not suffer from the limitations of classical ray theory nor from the angular limitations of the popular parabolic methods. The numerical approach is based on a split-step method, which has the advantage of splitting the original equation into simpler ones associated with specific physical mechanisms: diffraction, flows, heterogeneities, nonlinearities, absorption and relaxation. The method has been developed on parallel architecture for very high demanding 3D configurations using the Single Method Multiple Data paradigm. The method is validated through several test cases. A study of the lateral cut-off of the sonic boom finally illustrates the potentialities of the method for realistic cases. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We introduce a new level set method for representing evolving interfaces. In the case of divergence-free velocity fields, the new method satisfies a conservation principle. Conservation is important for many applications such as modeling two-phase incompressible flow. In the present implementation, the conserved quantity is defined as the integral of a smoothed characteristic function. The new approach embeds level sets into a volume of fluid formulation. The evolution of an approximate signed distance function is governed by a conservation law for its (smoothed) sign. The non-linear level set transport equation is regularized by adding a flux correction term that assures a non-singular Jacobian and penalizes deviations from a distance function. The result is a locally conservative level set method with built-in elliptic redistancing. The continuous model is monolithic in the sense that the level set transport model, the volume of fluid law of mass conservation, and the minimization problem that preserves the approximate distance function property are incorporated into a single equation. There is no need for any extra stabilization, artificial compression, flux limiting, redistancing, mass correction, and other numerical fixes which are commonly used in level set or volume of fluid methods. In addition, there is just one free parameter that controls the strength of regularization and penalization in the model. The accuracy and conservation properties of the monolithic finite element/level set method are illustrated by the results of numerical studies for passive advection of free interfaces.

AB This article deals with the thermodynamic equilibrium recovery mechanisms in two-phase flows and their numerical modeling. The two phases, initially at different pressures, temperatures and chemical potentials, are supposed to be driven towards equilibrium conditions by three relaxation processes. First, a mechanical process applies to relax phasic pressures, then a thermal process, to allow the sensible heat transfer between the phases at different temperatures, and, lastly, a chemical process that is responsible for the mass transfer.
   The two-phase flow model is composed of six partial differential equations with source terms that allow the description of mixtures at full thermodynamic disequilibrium. Its homogeneous portion is hyperbolic and it is solved by a second-order accurate finite volume scheme that uses a HLLC-type approximate Riemann solver. The source terms modeling the relaxation processes are separately integrated as three systems of ordinary differential equations.
   The main contributions of this paper are: the capability of describing the possibly non-instantaneous time delay of equilibrium recover in a novel way, the equation of state independence of the numerical scheme, and the possibility to take into account the morphology of the flow pattern by using the interfacial area between phases.

AB We propose a multiscale finite volume method (MSFV) for simulation of coupled flow-deformation in heterogeneous porous media under elastic deformation (i.e., poroelastic model). The fine-scale fully resolved system of equations is obtained based on a conservative finite-volume method in which the displacement and pore pressure unknowns are located in a staggered configuration. The coupling is treated through a fully-coupled fully-implicit formulation. On this fully-coupled finite-volume system, coarse-scale grids for flow and deformation are imposed. Local basis functions for scalar pore pressure and vectorial displacement unknowns are then solved over their respective local domains at the beginning of the simulation, and reused for the rest of the time-dependent simulations. These local basis functions are then clustered to form the prolongation operator. As for the finite-volume nature of the proposed multiscale system, finite-volume restriction operators for poroelastic systems are utilised. Once the coarse-scale system is solved, its solution is prolonged back to the original fine-scale resolution, providing approximate fine-scale solution. The finite-volume multiscale formulation provides conservative stress and mass flux both at fine and coarse scale. Several numerical test cases are provided first to validate the fine-scale finite-volume discrete fully-implicit simulation, and then to investigate the accuracy of the proposed multiscale formulation. Moreover we compare our fully implicit MSFV method with hybrid multiscale Finite Element-Finite Volume (h-MSFE-FV). Our multiscale method allows for quantification of the elastic geomechanical behaviour with using only a fraction of the fine-scale grid cells, even for highly heterogeneous time-dependent models. As such, it casts a promising approach for field-scale quantification of the mechanical deformation and stress field due to injection and production in a subsurface formation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Nongradient SDEs with small white noise often arise when modeling biological and ecological time-irreversible processes. If the governing SDE were gradient, the maximum likelihood transition paths, transition rates, expected exit times, and the invariant probability distribution would be given in terms of its potential function. The quasipotential plays a similar role for nongradient SDEs. Unfortunately, the quasipotential is the solution of a functional minimization problem that can be obtained analytically only in some special cases. We propose a Dijkstra-like solver for computing the quasipotential on regular rectangular meshes in 3D. This solver results from a promotion and an upgrade of the previously introduced ordered line integral method with the midpoint quadrature rule for 2D SDEs. The key innovations that have allowed us to keep the CPU times reasonable while maintaining good accuracy are (i) a new hierarchical update strategy, (ii) the use of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker theory for rejecting unnecessary simplex updates, and (iii) pruning the number of admissible simplexes and a fast search for them. An extensive numerical study is conducted on a series of linear and nonlinear examples where the quasipotential is analytically available or can be found at transition states by other methods. In particular, the proposed solver is applied to Tao's examples where the transition states are hyperbolic periodic orbits, and to a genetic switch model by Lv et al. (2014) [21]. The C source code implementing the proposed algorithm is available at M. Cameron's web page. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this article, a fast algorithm based on time two-mesh (TT-M) finite element (FE) scheme, which aims at solving nonlinear problems quickly, is considered to numerically solve the nonlinear space fractional Allen-Cahn equations with smooth and non-smooth solutions. The implicit second-order theta scheme containing both implicit Crank-Nicolson scheme and second-order backward difference method is applied to time direction, a fast TT-M method is used to increase the speed of calculation, and the FE method is developed to approximate the spacial direction. The TT-M FE algorithm includes the following main computing steps: firstly, a nonlinear implicit second-order theta FE scheme on the time coarse mesh tau(c) is solved by a nonlinear iterative method; secondly, based on the chosen initial iterative value, a linearized FE system on time fine mesh tau < tau(c) is solved, where some useful coarse numerical solutions are found by the Lagrange's interpolation formula. The analysis for both stability and a priori error estimates are made in detail. Finally, three numerical examples with smooth and non-smooth solutions are provided to illustrate the computational efficiency in solving nonlinear partial differential equations, from which it is easy to find that the computing time can be saved.

AB In this paper, an efficient, high-order accurate, level set reinitialisation method is proposed, based on the elliptic reinitialisation method (Basting and Kuzmin, 2013 [1]), which is discretised spatially using the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) symmetric interior penalty method (SIPG). In order to achieve this a number of improvements have been made to the elliptic reinitialisation method including; reformulation of the underlying minimisation problem driving the solution; adoption of a Lagrange multiplier approach for enforcing a Dirichlet boundary condition on the implicit level set interface; and adoption of a narrow band approach. Numerical examples confirm the high-order accuracy of the resultant method by demonstrating experimental orders of convergence congruent with optimal convergence rates for the SIPG method, that is h(p+1) and h(p) in the L-2 and DG norms respectively. Furthermore, the degree to which the level set function satisfies the Eikonal equation improves proportionally to h(p), and the often ignored homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition on the interface is shown to be satisfied accurately with a rate of convergence of at least h 2 for all polynomial orders.

AB Randomness often plays an important role in the spatial and temporal dynamics of biological systems. General stochastic simulation methods may lead to excessive computational cost for a system in which a large number of molecules involved. Therefore, multi-scale hybrid simulation methods become important for stochastic simulations. Here we build a spatially hybrid method which couples two approaches: discrete stochastic simulation and continuous stochastic differential equations. In our method, the locations of the interfaces between the two approaches are changing according to the distribution of molecules in a one-dimensional domain. To balance the accuracy and efficiency, the time step of the numerical method for the continuous stochastic differential equations is adapted to the dynamics of the molecules near the adaptive interfaces. The simulation results for a linear system and two nonlinear biological systems in different one-dimensional domains demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of our new hybrid method with the adaptive time step control.

AB Photonic graphene, a photonic crystal with honeycomb structures, has been intensively studied in both theoretical and applied fields. Similar to graphene which admits Dirac Fermions and topological edge states, photonic graphene supports novel and subtle propagating modes (edge modes) of electromagnetic waves. These modes have wide applications in many optical systems. In this paper, we propose a novel gradient recovery method based on Bloch theory for the computation of topological edge modes in photonic graphene. Compared to standard finite element methods, this method provides higher order accuracy with the help of gradient recovery technique. This high order accuracy is desired for constructing the propagating electromagnetic modes in applications. We analyze the accuracy and prove the superconvergence of this method. Numerical examples are presented to show the efficiency by computing the edge mode for the P-symmetry and C-symmetry breaking cases in honeycomb structures. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

TI Numerical generation of vector potentials from specified magnetic fields
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS

DT Article
DE Inverse curl; Vector potential; Magnetohydrodynamics; Numerical
   relativity
AB Many codes have been developed to study highly relativistic, magnetized flows around and inside compact objects. Depending on the adopted formalism, some of these codes evolve the vector potential A, and others evolve the magnetic field B = del x A directly. Given that these codes possess unique strengths, sometimes it is desirable to start a simulation using a code that evolves B and complete it using a code that evolves A. Thus transferring the data from one code to another would require an inverse curl algorithm. This paper describes two new inverse curl techniques in the context of Cartesian numerical grids: a cell-by-cell method, which scales approximately linearly with the numerical grid, and a global linear algebra approach, which has worse scaling properties but is generally more robust (e.g., in the context of a magnetic field possessing some nonzero divergence). We demonstrate these algorithms successfully generate smooth vector potential configurations in challenging special and general relativistic contexts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. In this study, IL-10 from big-belly seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis) (HaIL-10) was characterized based on its molecular and functional aspects. The coding sequence of HaIL-10 is 570 bp in length and encodes a 189-amino acid residue protein (calculated molecular weight, 21.89 kDa). The deduced amino acid sequence comprises a typical signal peptide and a mature peptide domain sequence carrying four conserved Cys residues and two additional Cys residues specific to fish. Phylogenetic analysis indicated an evolutionary relationship between HaIL-10 and its counterparts in other vertebrates, with close clustering to the fish-specific homologs. Recombinant HaIL-10 (rHaIL-10) significantly reduced nitric oxide (NO) production by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner but had no effect on cell viability, suggestive of its involvement in immune response. The protein expressions of iNOS and COX-2 were significantly reduced by rHaIL-10 in LPS-induced murine macrophages RAW 264.7 cells. HaIL-10 mRNA expression was observed in all analyzed tissues, with the maximum expression being noted in the kidney and ovary. However, transcriptional levels of HaIL-10 were significantly higher in the blood, gill, and intestine upon in vivo induction with LPS, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly (I:C)], and Streptococcus iniae. To summarize, our findings help in the improved understanding of the biological functions of HaIL-10 and modulation of HaIL-10 mRNA expression in response to immune stress.

AB The maternal genome directs almost all aspects of early animal development. As development proceeds, the elimination of maternal gene products and zygotic genome activation (ZGA) occur during the maternal to zygotic transition (MZT). To study the molecular mechanisms regulating this developmental event in Eriocheir sinensis, RNA-Seq technology was applied to generate comprehensive information on transcriptome dynamics during early embryonic stages. In total, 32,088 annotated unigenes were obtained from the transcriptomes of fertilized eggs and embryos at the cleavage (2-4 cell) and blastula stage. A total of 566 maternal genes and 1165 zygotic genes were isolated, among which 103 and 266 genes were predicted conserved maternal transcripts (COMATs) and conserved zygotic transcripts (COZYTs), respectively. The COMATs performed housekeeping gene functions and may be essential for initiating early embryogenesis of the Bilateria. Furthermore, 87, 76 and 117 differentially expressed genes associated with the MZT, morphogenesis and immunity were identified when compared the three transcriptomic datasets. We also unmask that the MZT takes place around the cleavage stage, when the genes involved in the clearance of maternal gene products and the ZGA were significantly up-regulated. Taken together, these datasets provide a valuable resource for understanding the mechanisms of early developmental events in E. sinensis, and facilitate further studies on molecular mechanisms of asynchronous development in crabs.

AB Background: To analyze the sequence of alpha-(1, 2)-fucosyltransferase gene (FUT1) in nine individuals with Para Bombay phenotype.
   Methods: Para-Bombay phenotype was defined according to the serologic characteristics and ABO genotypes. The full coding region of FUT1 was amplified, genotype and haplotype were analyzed by direct and TOPO cloning sequencing which was used to discriminate heterozygous mutations of FUT1.
   Results: These nine individuals were identified as three Para-Bombay A (Ah), six Para-Bombay B (Bh) according to serologic characteristics and ABO genotypes. According to the direct and cloning sequencing results of the full coding region of FUT1, five genotypes and five haplotypes were found in these nine individuals.
   Conclusion: Two complex mutations of FUT1 were discovered, which were h1h547 - 552delAG + 814A > G (c.547 - 552delAG, p.Arg183Argfs * 86; c.547 - 552delAG, p.Arg183Argfs * 86 + c.814A > G, p.lle272Val) and h755G > Ch547 - 552delAG + 755G > C (c.755G > C, p.Arg183Argfs * 86; c.547 - 548delAG, p.Arg183Argfs * 86 + c.755G > C, p.Arg253Pro), the genotype of h755G > Ch547 - 552delAG + 755G > C was reported for the first time, and three kinds of known genotype (h1h1, h3h3, h1h3) were found also in these nine Chinese individuals with Para-Bombay phenotype in the present study. In this way, the FUT1 mutation showed a distinct geographic and ethnic range.

AB Progression of tamoxifen resistance remained as a crucial obstacle to treatment of estrogen receptor positive breast carcinoma patients. Recent studies demonstrated the importance of DNA methylation pattern on tamoxifen refractory. This study aimed to investigate the protein expression pattern and clinicopathological significance of DNA methyltransferase 1, 3A and 3B, as leading factors in regulation of DNA methylation process, in breast carcinoma patients with adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. Seventy two Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) breast tumor tissues of tamoxifen sensitive (TAM-S) and tamoxifen resistance (TAM-R) patients were recruited for immunohistochemical experiments. DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b expressions were observed in 86, 72.2 and 100% of tamoxifen resistance patients, respectively. Data analysis indicated that DNMTs were overexpressed in TAM-R tumors (P < 0.05). In TAM-S subgroup, DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B expression was associated with high histologic grade (P = 0.049, P = 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively). DNMT3B expression was also correlated with lymphatic invasion (P = 0.034). In TAM-R subgroup, DNMT1 expression associated with extracapsular nodal extension (P = 0.019). DNMT3A and DNMT3B expression showed a significant association with high histologic grade (P = 0.001) and DNMT3A expression was also associated with HER-2 status (P = 0.027). Cox proportional hazard model demonstrated that overexpression of DNMT3B remained as an independent and unfavorable prognostic factor for disease free survival (P < 0.001). Taken together, these results suggest that DNMTs could be an effective factor in development of tamoxifen resistance in breast tumors.

AB Smad4 is the key regulator in the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1)/Smads signal pathway, and is also the crux of the regulation of type I collagen expression in mammals. In fish, however, the relationship between Smad4 and type I collagen is still unknown. Given the widely accepted importance of type I collagen in fish muscle hardness, we seek to explore this issue by analyzing the expressions of the TGF-beta 1/Smads pathway molecules and type I collagen in the muscle of crisp grass carp fed with faba bean, which shows increased muscle hardness. The study found that (1) in the process of feeding the grass carp with faba bean, the mRNA and protein expressions of TGF-beta 1, Smad2 and Smad4 all increased along with the increase of type I collagen expression (Col1 alpha 1 and Col1 alpha 2); (2) one day after the injection of Smad4 over-expression vector, both mRNA and protein expressions of Col1 alpha 1 and Col1 alpha 2 significantly increased, reaching the maximum on the 2nd and 5th day, respectively; (3) one day after the injection of Smad4 RNAi interference vector, the mRNA and protein expressions of Col1 alpha 1 and Col1 alpha 2 decreased, reaching the minimum on the 5th day. These results revealed that Smad4 is the major regulator of type I collagen in the muscle of grass carp fed with faba bean. This study would provide an important mechanistic basis for nutritional regulation of type I collagen in the muscle of fish.

AB Trehalose is a disaccharide with a pivotal role in plant growth and development. In contrast to the recent advances in understanding trehalose biosynthesis in plants, their catabolism of trehalose is poorly understood. Here, we isolated and characterized a trehalase gene, OsTRE1, in rice (Oryza sativa L.). An expression analysis in young seedlings revealed that OsTRE1 is induced by stresses such as salt, drought, and chilling. ABA treatment also transiently upregulated OsTRE1 expression. The accumulation of OsTRE1 mRNA in response to 150 mM NaCl was consistent with an increased trehalase activity in the roots. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsTRE1 showed remarkable increases in trehalase activity and dramatic decreases in trehalose abundance compared with the wild type, with little change in the levels of other soluble sugars, such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose. Callus cells generated from the transgenic lines overexpressing OsTRE1 were able to grow using trehalose as their sole carbon source. These data indicated that OsTRE1 is a functional trehalase gene in rice. The OsTRE1 overexpressors did not have notable morphological alterations or growth defects but exhibited enhanced salt tolerance, suggesting the involvement of OsTRE1 in salt stress tolerance in rice.

AB The SRPX2 gene (Sushi-repeat-containing protein, X-linked, 2, OMIM*300642), located on Xq22.1, encodes a secreted protein that is highly expressed in neurons of cerebral cortex. SRPX2 was first implicated in neurodevelopment, learning and rolandic seizure when two patients with potentially pathogenic variants, c.980A > G (p.Asn327Ser) and c.215A > C (p.Tyr72Ser), in SRPX2 gene were identified. Subsequent experimental studies demonstrated that SRPX2 is needed for vocalization and synapse formation in mice, and that both silencing SRPX2 and injecting (p.Asn327Ser) in mouse models results in alteration in neuronal migration in cerebral cortex and epilepsy. A number of studies demonstrated that SRPX2 interacts with FOXP2 (Foxhead box protein P2), a gene responsible for speech and language disorder, and that FoxP2 controls timing and level of expression of SRPX2. Despite the supportive evidence for the role of SRPX2 in speech and language development and disorders, there are questions over its definitive association with neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy.
   In this paper, the role of SRPX2 as one in a network of many genes involved in speech and language is discussed. The goal of this paper is to examine the role of SRPX2 variants through describing two patients with potentially pathogenic variants in SRPX2, c.751G > C (p.Ala251Pro) and c.762G > T (p.Lys254Asn) presenting with language and motor delay, intellectual disability as well as congenital anomalies. We explore the contribution of SRPX2 variants to clinical phenotype in our patients and conclude that these variants at least partially explain the phenotype. Further studies are necessary to establish and confirm the association between SRPX2 and neurodevelopment particularly speech and language development.

AB Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are recently reported to regulate the homeostasis of cartilage in osteoarthritis (OA), but their regulatory roles in OA synovium remain elusive. This study aimed to identify the differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs in OA synovium and further explore the function of differentially expressed lncRNAs in OA progression through bioinformatics analysis. We started with RNA-sequencing in 5 OA synovium samples and 5 healthy controls to compare the expression of mRNAs and lncRNAs. GO analysis and KEGG pathway analysis were performed to annotate the function of differentially expressed mRNAs. Then real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was admitted in 17 osteoarthritic synovium and 18 healthy controls to confirm the changes of the expression of the selected lncRNAs. LncRNA-mRNA co-expression network was constructed to predict the potential molecular regulatory mechanisms of specifically expressed lncRNAs in OA synovium. 384 mRNAs and 17 lncRNAs were detected to be differentially expressed in OA synovium. The expressions of 4 lncRNAs were confirmed by qRT-PCR. We found the differentially expression lncRNAs could potentially regulate OA progression through pathways regarding to immune response through the lncRNA-mRNA network and further annotation for co-expression mRNAs. Our results indicated that lncRNAs may play key roles in OA synovitis and may have potential value in OA diagnosis.

AB Prediction of cancer gene attributes by their primary structure (long amino acid sequence) is instrumental in large-scale genomics projects, especially in the field of genomics. Various methods are proposed to predict gene characteristics from its primary structure, but accurate prediction of it is still very challenging task. Here we introduce an electrical network based sensor or detector to discriminate cancer and non-cancer cells based on two features i.e. amino acid sequence length, and hydrophilic/hydrophobic property. The electrical circuit consists of resistors, capacitors and inductors, is used for modeling individual amino acid and cascaded to form gene system. Corresponding electrical responses are judged using Bode and Nyquist analyzers and achieve 89.55% accuracy with 87.06% True Positive rate and 95.42% True Negative rate, demonstrate that proposed electrical sensor model is very promising for predicting the cancer gene attributes as well as non-cancer gene in the field of large-scale genomics study.

AB Genes, are the functional units of heredity that used as an instructors to make proteins either to become the functional or structural part of the cell. Hence, the proteins get more attention because most of the life functions depends on it. Any mutation or alteration in genome sequences results in complete loss of function or formation of abnormal protein which leads to hereditary disorder. Gene therapy on the other hand, used as a remedy, a process that make correction in the gene which is responsible for genomic disorders. The treatment of disease state depends on the understanding of their genetic basis. While, numerous molecular genome editing tools have been developed and are being utilized to translate the abstract of gene therapy into reality, but the problem is still a mystery. The genome editing molecular scissors can be applied to dictate the selected genetic products that can have the therapeutic power. Thus, editing the specific sequences depends on the type of strategies being used by a molecule such is HDR or NHEJ. CRISPR/Cas9 editing technology can use in disease model to study the genitival disorders. One side the CRISPR technology seemed to be extremely accurate but on the other side it has some harmful effects i.e. Cas9 proteins sometimes cuts the similar sequences other than the specific targeted and Off-targeting Sequences etc. Urgent attention and improvement are needed for various implication of CRISPR/Cas9 technology, including the delivery, precision and control over the mention system. This review presents the current scenario of genome editing in vivo and its implications for the future of human genetic disease treatment as well as genome throughput potency.

AB Accumulating evidence has shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) had malfunctioning roles in the development of human cancers, especially lung adenocarcinoma (LC). In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role and potential mechanism of lncRNA long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 460 (LINC00460) in LC progression using human tissues and cell lines. We observed that LINC00460 was increased in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and cells in comparison to their corresponding controls. Moreover, overexpression of LINC00460 indicated the poor prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients. In addition, silencing LINC00460 was able to suppress lung adenocarcinoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Rescue assay confirmed that LINC00460 contributed to lung adenocarcinoma progression by regulating miR-302c-5p/FOXA1 signal pathway. In conclusion, LINC00460 promotes LC progression by competitively binding miR-302c-5p and regulating FOXA1 signal pathway. Our findings reveal that LINC00460 may be a potential prognostic biomarker and a candidate target for LC therapy.

AB The most common and lethal type of intracranial tumors include the astrocytomas. Grade IV astrocytoma or Glioblastoma (GBM) is highly aggressive and treatment-refractory with a median survival of only 14 to 16 months. Molecular profiling of GBMs reveals a high degree of intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity, and hence it is important to understand the important signalling axes that get deregulated in different GBM subtypes to provide effective tailor-made therapies. In this study, we have carried out extensive analysis of Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) data from TCGA cohort to develop protein signatures that define glioma grades or subtypes. The protein signatures that distinguished Grade II or III from GBM had largely overlapped, and pathway analysis revealed the positive enrichment of extracellular matrix proteins (ECM), MYC pathway, uPAR pathway and G2/M checkpoint genes in GBM. We also identified protein signatures for GBMs with genetic alterations (IDH mutation, p53 mutation, EGFR amplification or mutation, CDKN2A/CDKN2B deletion, and PTEN mutation) that occur at high frequency. G-CIMP positive GBM-specific protein signature showed a large similarity with IDH1-mutant protein signature, thus signifying the importance of IDH1 mutation driving the G-CIMP. Gene expression subtype analysis revealed an association of specific proteins to classical (EGFR and phosphor variants), mesenchymal (SERPINE1, TAZ, and Myosin-IIa_pS1943), neural (TUBA1B), and proneural (GSK3_pS9) types. Univariate Cox regression analysis identified several proteins showing significant correlation with GBM survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that IGFBP2 and RICTOR_pT1135 are independent predictors of survival. Overall, our analyses reveal that specific proteins are regulated in different glioma subtypes underscoring the importance of diverse signalling axes playing important role in the pathogenesis of glioma tumors.

AB Weedy rice is an important germplasm resource for rice improvement because it has useful genes for many abiotic stresses including cold tolerance. We identified the cold tolerance and cold sensitivity of two weedy rice lines (WR 03-35 and WR 03-26) and two cultivated rice lines (Kongyu 131 and 9311). During the seedling stage of these lines, we used RNA-seq to measure changes in weedy rice and cultivated rice whole-genome transcriptome before and after cold treatment. We identified 14,213 and 14,730 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in cold-tolerant genotypes (WR 03-35, Kongyu 131), and 9219 and 720 DEGs were observed in two cold sensitive genotypes (WR 03-26, 9311). Many common and special DEGs were analyzed in cold-tolerant and cold sensitive genotypes, respectively. Some typical genes related to cold stress such as the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) gene and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain gene etc. The number of these DEGs in cold-tolerant genotypes is more than those found in cold-sensitive genotypes. The gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses showed significantly enriched terms for biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions. In addition, some genes related to several plant hormones such as abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellic acid (GA), auxin and ethylene were identified. To confirm the RNA-seq data, semi-quantitative RT-PCR and qRT-PCR were performed on 12 randomly selected DEGs. The expression patterns of RNA-seq on these genes corresponded with the semi-quantitative RT-PCR and qRT-PCR method. This study suggests the gene resources related to cold stress from weedy rice could be valuable for understanding the mechanisms involved in cold stress and rice breeding for improving cold tolerance.

AB Intramuscular fat (IMF) has significant effects on the tenderness, juiciness, and flavor of chicken, which are important determinants of poultry meat quality. Although many studies have focused on microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in adipogenesis, little is known about miRNAs associated with poultry IMF deposition or intramuscular adipocyte differentiation. Bioinformatic analysis identified mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAM) as a putative target of miR-223. To explore the role of miR-223 in the process of chicken IMF deposition, loss and gain of function experiments were performed in primary intramuscular preadipocytes using miR-223 mimics, miR-223 inhibitor, and si-GPAM. Our results showed that miR-223 is significantly down-regulated in the breast muscle tissues of Gushi hens at the later-laying period in comparison with hens at the pre-laying period. Using qRT-PCR, we found that miR-223 expression in chicken tissues and intramuscular adipocytes correlates negatively with GPAM expression. Cell transfection experiments suggest that miR-223 inhibits intramuscular adipocyte differentiation via targeting GPAM. Experiments using a dual luciferase reporter system show that GPAM is a direct target of miR-223. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that miR-223 regulates intramuscular fat deposition in chickens.

AB Sucrose synthase and sucrose transporter are involved in sucrose metabolism and partitioning of photosynthetic products, respectively. In this study, we cloned SUCROSE SYNTHASE 1 and SUCROSE TRANSPORTER 2 genes from ramie. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that BnSUS1 and BnSUT2 were widely expressed in the analyzed tissues. Subsequently, the two promoters of BnSUS1 and BnSUT2 were isolated and truncated. The two promoters and their truncated fragments were fused GUS to transform into Arabidopsis. GUS staining showed that BriSUS1(pro)-1690 and BnSUS1(pro)-1420 had vascular specificity in cotyledons and mature leaves while BriSUT2(pro)-2239, BnSUT2(pro)-1681, BruSUT2(pro)-1199 and BnSUT2(pro)-618 had a constitutive function in seedlings and mature organs. Notably, the activity of BrISUT2(pro)-2239 and its fragments (except that of BnSUT2(pro)-231) are strongly induced by mechanical wounding. Moreover, BnSUS1(pro)-1051 and BnSUS1(pro)-485 are sensitive to CuSO4 treatment while BruSUT2(pro)-2239 and BriSUT2(pro)-1681 are sensitive to PEG and ABA treatments, respectively. Our findings will provide the foundation for deciphering the functions of BnSUS1 and BnSUT2, and also expand the promoter library to provide more options for plant genetic engineering.

AB Background: The roles of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) -765G > C (rs20417) and -1195G > A (rs689466) polymorphisms in gastric cancer were intensively analyzed, but the results of these studies were inconsistent. We conducted a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis to elucidate the associations between these two COX2 polymorphisms and gastric cancer risk.
   Methods: Eligible studies were searched in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library databases, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Vip, and Wanfang databases. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the genetic correlation between COX2 polymorphisms and gastric cancer susceptibility in five genetic models. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was conducted to estimate whether the evidence of the results is sufficient. Furthermore, their interactions with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) or smoking in gastric cancer were also assessed using a case-only method.
   Results: The COX2 gene -765G > C polymorphism showed no significant association with gastric cancer susceptibility under all the five genetic models (take the allelic model for example: OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 0.95-2.09) in total analysis, and the stratification analysis by ethnicity indicated a similar association in Caucasian group under four genetic models (allelic model, dominant model, homozygous model, and heterozygous model). But in the subgroup of the Asian population, the -765G > C polymorphism was significantly associated with gastric cancer risk under the same contrast. The COX2 -1195G > A polymorphism showed significant correlation with gastric cancer susceptibility in total analysis, and stratification analysis by ethnicity also revealed a similar association in both Asian and Caucasian groups under the same contrast. Moreover, TSA confirmed such associations. Both H. pylori infection and cigarette smoking interacted with -765 C allele in gastric cancer (OR = 3.79, 95% CI: 1.15-12.43 and OR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.38-4.48, respectively), but not in 1195 A allele (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 0.62-6.21, and OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 0.93-1.64, respectively).
   Conclusions: COX2 -765G > C polymorphism may serve as a genetic biomarker of gastric cancer in Asians, but not in Caucasians. COX2 -1195G > A polymorphism may serve as a genetic biomarker of gastric cancer in both Asians and Caucasians. The -765G > C, rather than -1195G > A polymorphism interacted with H. pylori infection or cigarette smoking to increase gastric cancer risk.

AB HIGD1A can reduce ROS and apoptosis in cells under low-glucose or hypoxic conditions, and HIGD1A is one of the target genes for miR-375, according to our previous studies. However, it is not known whether miR-375 can indirectly regulate ROS and apoptosis in porcine Sertoli cells. To answer this question, HIGD1A and miR-375 were overexpressed in porcine Sertoli cells, and ROS and apoptosis were assayed. The results showed that ROS levels and expression levels of CASPASE3 in HIGD1A-overexpressing cells were significantly lower than those in the control cells. However, ROS levels and CASPASE3 expression in miR-375-overexpressing cells were significantly higher than those in the control cells. The rate of apoptosis in HIGD1A-overexpressing cells was significantly lower than that in miR-375-overexpressing cells. Considering that the HIGD1A gene is a target of miR-375, these findings suggest that miR-375 can induce an increase in ROS levels and apoptosis by inhibiting HIGD1A in porcine ST cells.

AB Objectives: Numerous studies have investigated the association between patatin-like phospholipase domain containing protein-3 (PNPLA3) rs738409 C > G polymorphism and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the results are conflicting and inconclusive among different populations. Thus, a meta-analysis was performed to resolve this inconsistency.
   Methods: Potentially related studies were investigated in PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) up to June 12, 2018. The odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to explore the strength of the associations. Subgroup analysis was performed according to ethnicity and etiology of cases. Publication bias detection was conducted using Egger's test.
   Results: Fourteen case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis, reporting a total of 3527 HCC patients and 7184 controls. Overall results revealed that PNPLA3 rs738409 C > G polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of HCC in the populations studied with various types of etiology under allelic model (OR = 1.59, 95%CI: 1.20-2.10, P = 0.001), dominant model (OR = 1.55, 95%CI: 1.13-2.13, P = 0.007), homozygous model (OR = 2.76, 95%CI: 1.52-5.01, P = 0.001), heterozygous model (OR = 1.31, 95%CI: 1.01-1.69, P = 0.039), and recessive model (OR = 2.42, 95%CI: 1.51-3.87, P < 0.001). A significant increased risk was observed in patients with HCC related to alcoholic cirrhosis under all genetic models (C vs. G: OR = 3.35, 95%CI: 2.14-5.24, P < 0.001; CC vs.GG: OR = 11.02, 95%CI: 4.35-27.88, P < 0.001; CC vs. GC: OR = 2.75, 95%CI: 1.72-4.39, P < 0.001; GG vs. CC + CG: OR = 5.82, 95%CI: 2.93-11.57, P < 0.001; CG + GG vs. CC: OR = 4.08, 95%CI: 2.33-7.13, P < 0.001), with respect to specific etiology of HCC. A significant increased risk was also revealed in patients with HCC due to virus related cirrhosis under allelic model (OR = 1.19, 95%CI: 1.07-1.32, P = 0.001), dominant model (OR = 1.17, 95%CI: 1.02-1.35, P = 0.03), homozygous model (OR = 1.47, 95%CI: 1.17-1.85, P = 0.001), and recessive model (OR = 1.43, 95%CI: 1.15-1.76, P = 0.001). Subgroup analysis on ethnicity revealed that the polymorphism was associated with increased risk of HCC in Caucasians under allelic model (OR = 1.65, 95%CI: 1.12-2.45, P = 0.012), dominant model (OR = 1.63, 95%CI: 1.04-4.25, P = 0.035), homozygous model (OR = 2.88, 95%CI: 1.27-6.55, P = 0.012), and recessive model (OR = 2.48, 95%CI: 1.32-4.65, P = 0.005).
   Conclusions: Our study suggests a significant increased association between PNPLA3 rs738409 C > G polymorphism and HCC risk in the entire populations studied, especially in Caucasians. Therefore, PNPLA3 rs738409 C > G polymorphism may be a risk factor for virus and alcoholic-related HCC.

AB The ACTN3 gene codes for alpha-actinin-3, a protein localized in the Z-line in the skeletal muscle. Actinin-3 is critical in anchoring the myofibrillar actin filaments and plays a key role in muscle contraction. ACTN3 (alpha-actinin-3) cross-links glycogen phosphorylase (GP), which is the key enzyme catalysing glycogen metabolism. The aim of present study was to establish the expression level of the ACTN3 gene (for both isoforms separately and together in the gene expression analysis) in the gluteus medius muscle in order to verify if the alpha-actinin-3 gene can be related to training intensity in Arabian horses. A structural analysis of the ACTN3 gene was performed simultaneously to identify polymorphisms that can be related to racing performance traits. Our results showed the significant decrease (p < 0.05) of ACTN3 expression in the skeletal muscle of Arabian horses during the training periods preparing for flat-racing, and this decrease differed by the intensity of the exercises. The highest mRNA abundance measured for all ACTN3 genes was detected in the muscle of untrained horses, while the lowest expression was identified at the end of the racing season when horses had fully adapted to the physical effort. This gene expression profile was confirmed for both ACTN3 isoforms. The analysis of the ACTN3 sequence allowed us to identify 14 polymorphisms, which were localized in the promoter region, the 5'UTR (7 SNPs), exons (2 SNPs) and introns (5 SNPs). Two of them, a novel c.2334C > T - splice variant and the g.1104G > A polymorphism in the promoter region, were proposed as the causative mutations that might affect gene expression. The presented gene expression analyses indicated the significant role of the ACTN3 gene in adaptation to physiological effort in horses. Due to previous reports and our findings, further studies should be conducted to verify the usage of the ACTN3 gene as a potential genetic marker for determining exercise performance in Arabian horses and other horse breeds.

AB Schizothorax prenanti is a cold-water fish species with great economic importance in aquaculture in Western China, and the underlying mechanisms of muscle development and growth in S. prenanti remain to be elucidated. In this study, deep RNA sequencing was performed to provide an in-depth view of the transcriptome of skeletal muscle of S. prenanti with the specific objective to identify expressed genes in the skeletal muscle of S. prenanti at 30 days post-hatching (S01), 1 year (S02), and 3 years (S03). De novo assembly of high-quality reads generated 132,784 transcripts with an average length of 1282 bp and 67,596 unigenes with an average length of 1559 bp. 2445 unigenes were differentially expressed with 1483 up-regulated and 962 down-regulated in the skeletal muscle of S. prenanti at S01 and S02 stages, and 1936 unigenes were significantly impacted at S02 and S03 stages with 1153 increased and 783 decreased. GO analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes are involved in various biological processes with dominance by cell & cell part, binding & catalytic activity, and cellular process & metabolic process. KEGG enrichment suggested that there are considerable differences in the physiological processes at different stages of muscle development and growth of S. prenanti. PPAR signaling pathway, cardiac muscle contraction, fatty acid metabolism, tight junction, and focal adhesion were the top pathways enriched in comparison between S01 and S02 stages. Whereas significant enrichment of the TCA cycle, fatty acid metabolism, fatty acid elongation in mitochondria, valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, and propanoate metabolism pathway was found in differentially expressed genes identified between S02 and S03 stages. This study provides not only an overall insight into the global gene expression landscape in the skeletal muscle of S. prenatal, but also candidate genes or markers that can be used for further investigations of the underlying mechanisms of skeletal muscle development and growth of S. prenanti.

AB Background: Levels of CCL20 and its CCR6 receptor are elevated in many autoimmune diseases which help in the recruitment of T helper (Th17) cells to site of inflammation.
   Objectives: Determine the value of single nucleotide polymorphism of CCL20 (rs6749704) and IL-17F (rs763780) genes and their concomitant effect on the serum CCL20 level and susceptibility to MS in Egyptian patients.
   Subjects and methods: Blood samples were collected from 83 patients and 95 healthy subjects. Serum levels of CCL20 were measured by ELISA. The DNA was analyzed for rs6749704 and rs763780 using Genotyping Taqman assay.
   Results: The mean serum levels of CCL20 in the MS group were significantly higher than healthy group (P < 0.001). Frequencies of CT genotype of rs6749704 in CCL20 gene and C allele in MS patients were significantly higher compared to controls. Also significant increase of rs763780 in IL-17F gene was detected in MS patients. Concomitant polymorphism in both genes in MS patients showed an increase risk to MS rather than individual locus.
   Conclusion: CCL20 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of MS. Both allelic variation of (rs6749704) within CCL20 gene and (rs763780) within IL-17F gene can be considered risk factor for development of MS in Egyptian patients.

AB A Bayesian statistical method was developed to assess the noteworthiness of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-phenotype association that shows statistical significance in various observational studies, but it has seldom been applied to GWAS meta-analyses in cancers. Data (i.e. allelic frequency, odds ratio, 95% confidence interval, etc.) on various SNP-cancer associations were extracted from meta-analysis of GWAS and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) Catalog of Published GWAS and were used to compute the false positive report probability (FPRP) and Bayesian false discovery probability (BFDP) to evaluate the noteworthiness of SNP-cancer associations. Independent paired t-tests showed a direct relationship between SNP cancer P-values and both FPRP and BFDP estimates. However, a discrepancy in the number of noteworthy associations between P-value comparison and either FPRP or BFDP was found using data extracted from meta analyses of GWAS and the GWAS Catalog. Most P-values of associations with nonsignificant P-values but with noteworthy FPRP and BFDP estimates were within the range of 10(-6) to 5 x 10(-8). A poorly selected genome-wide significance threshold and inclusion of a nonsignificant SNP-phenotype association into the noteworthy test can, with either noteworthy FPRP or BFDP computation, give a false impression of noteworthiness for a nonsignificant association.

AB Background: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder mainly caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene, determining a deficit of C1 inhibitor (C1-INH). In approximately 10% of the cases, HAE with C1-INH deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) is caused by large gene rearrangements, which are not detected by Sanger sequencing. Here we present the exon quantification technique (EQT), a molecular diagnostic test for the detection of large genetic rearrangements in SERPING1, mapping the exact size and location of the deletion caused by the recombination of AM elements. EQT analysis was performed on total DNA extracted from blood of patients belonging to two Brazilian families with a medical history of HAE, low plasma levels of C4 and C1-INH and no pathogenic alteration in SERPING1 analyzed by Sanger sequencing.
   Results: Two large deletions were found, one of 1356 pb and one of 1804 pb, which resulted from recombination of two Alu elements present in introns 3 and 4 of the gene.
   Conclusion: These results showed that the EQT could be used as a simple, rapid, and efficient diagnosis test for analysis of large deletions and insertions involving SERPINGI, otherwise not detected by Sanger sequencing, serving as a support technique for molecular diagnosis of HAE.

AB Computational analyses play crucial roles in characterizing splicing isoforms in plant genomes. In this review, we provide a survey of computational tools used in recently published, genome-scale splicing analyses in plants. We summarize the commonly used software and pipelines for read mapping, isoform reconstruction, isoform quantification, and differential expression analysis. We also discuss methods for analyzing long reads and the strategies to combine long and short reads in identifying splicing isoforms. We review several tools for characterizing local splicing events, splicing graphs, coding potential, and visualizing splicing isoforms. We further discuss the procedures for identifying conserved splicing isoforms across plant species. Finally, we discuss the outlook of integrating other genomic data with splicing analyses to identify regulatory mechanisms of AS on genome-wide scale.

AB Ferritin is not only a biomarker of total iron status and systemic inflammation but is also associated with metabolic disorders. A number of genetic variations have been identified to affect serum ferritin, but there is limited understanding of the genetic variations in serum ferritin. To evaluate the relationships among genetic variations, metabolism and ferritin, we performed a secondary analysis of our previous genome-wide association study of ferritin. After adjusting for population stratification and age, the rs671 in ALDH2 was significantly associated with ferritin concentrations (P-combined = 2.98 x 10(-8)). Men carrying the mutated genotype of rs671 had lower serum ferritin levels. BMI was the mediation between rs671 and ferritin (P = 0.003). Moreover, a significant interaction between rs671 and alcohol consumption on ferritin levels was observed (P = 3.02 x 10(-4)). rs671 genotypes were significantly relevant to serum ferritin in drinkers (P = 2.39 x 10(-7)). We reported that rs671 was associated with ferritin in a manner of BMI mediation. These findings will provide new insights into the impacts of genetic variations and metabolisms on serum ferritin levels.

AB Despite advances in early diagnosis and treatment, cancer still remains the major reason of mortality worldwide. The forkhead box A (FOXA) family is reported to participate in diverse human diseases. However, little is known about their expression and prognostic values in human lung cancer. Herein, we conducted a detailed cancer vs. normal analysis. The mRNA expression levels of FOXA family in numerous kind of cancers, including lung cancer, were analyzed using the Oncomine and GEPIA database. We observed that the mRNA expression levels of FOXA1, and FOXA3 were all increased while FOXA2 were decreased in most cancers compared with normal tissues, especially in lung cancer. Moreover, the expression levels of FOXA1, and FOXA3 are also highly expressed, while FOXA2 were decreased in almost all cancer cell lines, particularly in lung cancer cell lines, analyzing by Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and EMBL-EBI databases. Furthermore, the LinkedOmics database was used to evaluate the prognostic values, indicating that higher expression of FOXA1, FOXA3 indicated a poor overall survival (OS), while increased FOXA2 revealed a better OS in lung cancer. To conclusion, FOXA family showed significant expression differences between cancer and normal tissues, especially lung cancer, and FOXA1, FOXA3 could be promising prognostic biomarkers for lung cancer.

AB Recent evidences had shown activation of TLR (toll-like receptors) and NLR (nod-like receptors) in response to imbalance in nutrients intake, such as lipid and glucose. The main aim of this study was to investigate possible associations between 11 SNPs in TLR2, TLR4, NLRC4, CARDS and NEK7 genes and lipid and glucose metabolism. Sample was composed by healthy children and adolescents (n = 158) and adults (n = 115). DNA extraction was obtained by salting-out and sample genotyping by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry based system. LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, total cholesterol, glucose and insulin were measured by standard automated methods. Means were compared by t-test or Mann-Whitney test. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to verify association between polymorphisms and lipid and glucose markers. Seven polymorphisms in 5 genes were associated with lipid and glucose parameters. For lipid parameters, the following associations were found: higher LDL-C levels and C allele of rs1554973 (TLR4) and G allele of rs6671879 (NEK7); higher HDL-cholesterol levels and A allele of rs13105517 (TLR2); higher total cholesterol and TT genotype of rs3804099 (TLR2) and G allele of rs6671879 (NEK7); higher triglycerides levels and G allele of rs455060 (NLRC4). For glucose parameters associations were found between C allele of rs7258674 (CARDS) and higher glucose levels, and between C allele of rs212704 (NLRC4) and G allele of rs455060 (NLRC4) and insulin levels. These findings indicate a relationship between polymorphisms of TLRs and NLRs genes and markers of lipid and glucose metabolism.

AB There is an increasing evidence that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. This study focused on the functional role of P73 antisense RNA 1T (TP73-AS1), a lncRNA, in colorectal cancer (CRC). We found that TP73-AS1 expression was significantly low in CRC tissues and cells, and high TP73-AS1 expression was negatively associated with TNM stage, prognosis, overall survival, and disease-free survival in the CRC patients. Moreover, TP73-AS1 overexpression dramatically inhibited CRC cell growth, promoted apoptosis, downregulated Bcl-2 levels, and increased caspase-3 expression. Furthermore, TP73-AS1 expression levels were positively associated with PTEN levels in clinical CRC samples. As expected, TP73-AS1 could upregulate PTEN expression in CRC cells. Mechanistically, PTEN was shown to be the target of miR-103. Interestingly, TP73-AS1 overexpression could increase PTEN expression through competitive binding to miR-103. Functionally, our data show that such TP73-AS1-induced PTEN expression through binding to miR-103 facilitated CRC cell proliferation. Thus, we showed that TP73-AS1 inhibits CRC cell growth by functioning as a ceRNA (competing endogenous RNAs) to regulate PTEN levels. Our findings provide new insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of TP73-AS1-mediated CRC.

AB In- silica and functional genomics approaches have been used to determine cellular functions of two hypothetical proteins All1122 and Alr0750 of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. Motif analysis and multiple sequence alignment predicted them as typical alpha/beta ATP binding universal stress family protein-A (UspA) with G-(2 x)-G-(9 x)-G(S/T) as conserved motif. qRT-PCR data under UV-B, NaCl, heat, As, CdCl2, mannitol and methyl viologen registered approximately 1.4 to 4.3 fold induction of all1122 and alr0750 thus confirming their multiple abiotic stress tolerance potential. The recombinant E. coli (BL21) cells harboring All1122 and Alr0750 showed 12-41% and 23-41% better growth respectively over wild type control under said abiotic stresses thus revalidating their stress coping ability. Functional complementation on heterologous expression in UspA mutant E. coli strain LN29MG1655 (Delta uspA::Kan) attested their UspA family membership. This study tempted us to suggest that recombinant Anabaena PCC 7120 over expressing all122 and alr0750 might contribute to the nitrogen economy in paddy fields experiencing array of abiotic stresses including drought and nutrient limitation.

AB Objective: Interleukins are important molecules involved in tumor formation. In this study, the association between renal cell carcinoma (RCC) risk and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on IL-4/IL-13/IL-4R was assessed.
   Methods: We recruited 620/623 cases/controls and conducted a case-control study. Five tagSNPs (i.e., IL-4R rs8832, IL-4R rs4787951, IL-13 rs1881457, IL-13 rs2066960 and IL-13 rs2069744) were selected. Odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained to appraise the association between SNPs and RCC susceptibility. Luciferase report assay and EMSA were conducted to investigate whether SNPs could affect binding affinity of transcription factors to target genes.
   Results: IL-4R rs4787951T > C was significantly associated with RCC susceptibility. Individuals carrying CC genotypes had a significant increment in RCC risk compared with TT genotype carriers (adjusted OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.07-2.28, P = 0.020). By stratified analyses, more pronounced association was found in the female, diabetic or without smoking, drinking and hypertension group. Besides, SNP rs4787951 could influence the binding affinity of IL-4R to transcription factors. Sequence surrounding allele T was prone to bind transcription factor NFATc.
   Conclusions: This study revealed that IL-4R rs4787951T > C was associated with susceptibility of RCC and could be a predictive biomarker for RCC risk.

AB Fluorinated graphene has attracted a lot of scientific interest due to its excellent properties and novel structure, but its applications are still challenging because of its poor dispersion and severe agglomeration. We propose a solvent-free synthesis of novel modified fluorinated graphene oxide (mFGO) with good water compatibility with. We used graphene oxide (GO) prepared by Hummers method as a precursor. The oxygen-containing functional groups on GO were hydrothermally reacted to convert GO into FGO. Then, the amino functional groups were introduced to the FGO surface by a solvent-free urea modification reaction. This method produced graphene modified with both fluorine and amino groups in high yield. It shows great potential in introducing mFGO as a reactive modifier in waterborne epoxy materials for a variety of industrial applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Magnesium alloy Mg-4Y-3Nd (WN43) was subjected to ECAP at T similar to 300 degrees C up to 8 passes, using route B-C. The initial as-extruded material with average grain size of similar to 10 mu m, was effectively refined down to sub-micrometer scale, reaching a grain size of similar to 380 nm, after 8 passes. At the same time, secondary phase particle precipitation of beta'-Mg12Nd2Y, and beta-Mg14Nd2Y was induced. At 8 passes, fragmentation and coarsening of these phases occurred. Both grain refinement and beta'/beta precipitation strengthened the alloy. The strengthening was detected by nanoindentation hardness and accounted of up to 30% increment at 8 ECAP pass, compared to the initial extruded condition. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Silver nanoparticles loaded polyurethane/keratin nanofibrous mats (PU/Keratin/AgNPs) were fabricated via electrospinning, silver ion immobilization, followed by in situ reduction. The size and loading amount of AgNPs were regulated by varying the solution concentration of silver ions. The mats were characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). The PU/Keratin/AgNPs mats were exploited as catalyst support to reduce 4-nitroaniline (4-NA) in presence of borohydride, and their excellent catalytic activity showed the loading dependent feature. Moreover, these mats exhibited a stable catalytic activity up to 5 cycles. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID IMPROVED THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; COMPOSITES
AB A multilayer-structured polyimide nanocomposite based on a combination of polydopamine (PDA)-coated copper nanoparticles (CuNPs@PDA) and copper nanowires (CuNWs@PDA) was synthesized using a flexible and rapid method. The maximum thermal conductivity of (CuNPs-CuNWs)@PDA/polyimide (PI) composite with 10 wt% filler loading was increased to 4.13 W/mK, which was an enhancement by nearly 23 times compared with the use of neat PI matrix. The relative permittivity and dielectric loss were about 4.58 and 0.022 at 1 MHz, respectively. The use of multilayer-structure facilitated increased thermal conductivity and reduced permittivity of the nanocomposite compared with CuNPs@PDA/PI and CuNWs@PDA/PI films. The highly thermal conductive nanocomposites are promising for applications in thermal management. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mesoporous activated carbon was prepared from needle coke via two-stage steam activation process under high temperature. Two-stage steam activation method involves three main steps: 1st steam activation to generate mesopores and macropores above 2 nm; coating and impregnation of substances with a low molecular weight into the pores; 2nd steam activation to expand the pore size and micropore volume. The needle coke was characterized by elemental analysis, polarized light microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis, and the porosity structure was analyzed by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, the t-plot method, the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method, and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The maximum specific surface area and mesopore volume ratio of activated carbon manufactured by two-stage steam activation method was 1134 m(2)/g and 78%, respectively. The mesopore volume and average pore diameter increased as more coating and impregnation agents were added. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The controllable thermal expansion property gives us a method to design materials with desirable coefficient of thermal expansion. In this paper, we report a tunable zero thermal expansion (ZTE) in C-doped La(Fe, Si)(13) compounds over a wide operation-temperature window (77-260 K). The effects of the interstitial C atoms on the thermal expansion and magnetic properties of the LaFe10.0Si3.0Cx (x = 0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) compounds were respectively investigated. The further magnetic analysis indicates that the ZTE behaviors of this La(Fe, Si)(13)-based compounds are attributed to the changes of magnetic exchange couplings because of the introduction of interstitial C atoms.

AB The effect of Cr2O3 additive on nitridation of Si powder was studied at 1200 degrees C, 1300 degrees C and 1350 degrees C. At 1200 degrees C for 2 h, only Cr2N and CrSi2 peaks were found except Si in sample with 8 wt% Cr2O3. At 1300 degrees C, no visible Si3N4 peak was detected by XRD in pure Si sample, but in Cr2O3 added samples and with increasing of Cr2O3 additive the intensity of Si was reduced. At 1350 degrees C, Si peaks weakened in pure Si sample and Si powder was completely nitrided with Cr2O3 additive. The results showed that Cr2O3 additive improved the nitridation degree by the transformation between Cr2O3 and Cr2N and increasing the nitridation temperature promoted the nitridation of Si.

AB Magnesium alloys with Ag-Cu interlayer were joined by ultrasonic-induced transient liquid phase bonding. The influence of ultrasonic vibration time was studied. The mechanical properties of joints at room temperature and higher temperature were measured. With ultrasonic vibration time increasing, the ternary eutectic reaction between base metal and interlayer formed eutectic liquid phase. Mg element gradually diffused toward the center of weld, the liquid phase increased, and then the width of weld widen, substances such as solid solution alpha-Mg, AgMg3, CuMg2 were observed in weld. The weld was gradually closed with the extrusion of liquid phase and the diffusion of elements. At room temperature, the shear strength of joints could reach to similar to 92 MPa, and the fracture partly occurred in base metal. The shear strength of nearly closed joints increased with temperature decreased from 300 degrees C to room temperature. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work focuses on demonstration of reliable and versatile method for processing cellular mayenite (Ca12Al14O33) -based ceramics with designed porosity, with emphasis on potential catalytic applications. Highly porous (up to 82% of open porosity) monoliths were obtained by emulsification of liquid paraffin in aqueous suspensions of mixed CaCO3 and Al2O3 powders followed by burnout of the organic phase and reactive firing at various temperatures. The results have shown that this method is particularly suitable for processing of mayenite and allows simultaneous retaining of highly open cellular structure with reproducible pore size and a major content of Ca12Al14O33 phase in a wide range of processing conditions. The correlations between firing conditions, minor nominal aluminium excess, porous structure and phase composition were analysed based on Taguchi experimental planning. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This unique architecture provides the structural stability of SnO2 nanoparticles with double assurance, as well as improves the conductivity of whole composite. As a result, the as-prepared TiO2/SnO2/C composite exhibits superior lithium storage. Moreover, the preparation of elliptic TiO2/SnO2/C composite can further enrich the variety of the morphologies of TiO2/SnO2/C composites. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The electrical transport properties of the samples have been optimized effectively by Te doping, and the lattice thermal conductivities have been further reduced through introducing defects by high synthesis pressure. In the whole synthesis pressure range, the overall performances of samples increase with increasing synthesis pressures. The minimum lattice thermal conductivity of In0.05Ba0.15Co4Sb11.5Te0.5 sample prepared at 2.0 GPa reached 1.02 W m( 1) K- 1.

DE Gelatin; Silver nanowires; Stretchability; Conductivity; Strain sensor
AB A stretchable gelatin/silver nanowires (GE-AgNWs) composite hydrogel with enhanced mechanical properties and electrical conductivity has been prepared through chemical grafting and physical crosslinking. By introducing thiol groups on the gelatin molecular chain, better interactions between the reinforcing AgNWs and the gelatin molecules in the hydrogel networks was established. The introduced AgNWs not only reinforced the hydrogels but also formed effective electrical pathways to endow the hydrogel with good conductivity. By using the "salting out" effect, additional physical crosslinks were introduced to the hydrogel network so that the composite hydrogel became stretchable. The resulting composite hydrogel was not only biocompatible, but could also be used as a strain sensor to detect multiple human motions. Hence, these hydrogels have the potential to be used in biosensors, electric skins, and health monitoring applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Porous Ba-doped Pd/gamma-Al2O3 hollow microspheres were successfully synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method with the assistance of lysine, barium and NH4HCO3. The introduction of lysine and NH4HCO3 is beneficial to the formation of porous hollow microspheres and the promotion of specific surface area. The addition of BaO effectively improves the surface basicity of catalysts. The obtained porous Pd/Ba-gamma-Al2O3 hollow microspheres are about 5-6 mu m in diameter and shell thickness of 1 mu m. The porous Pd/Ba-gamma-Al2O3 hollow microspheres also exhibit higher catalytic activity for CO and C3H8 oxidation compared with the one without adding lysine and NH4HCO3. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In present work, poplar catkin with microtube structure was carbonized at 800 degrees C in N-2 and subsequently the carbonized microtubes were broken into microsheets by ultrasonic crushing. The palladium nanoparticles (NPs) were highly dispersed on the microsheets to form Pd/carbonized poplar catkin (Pd/CPC) composite. The synthesized composite showed extraordinary catalytic performance with high initial turnover frequency of 1613 moI(H2)/(mol(metal).h) for formic acid (FA) dehydrogenation. The composite also exhibited high selectivity, good stability and reproducibility during the catalytic process. These results indicate that Pd/CPC nanocatalyst has particular potential for hydrogenation reactions from hydrogen-rich substrates in practical applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB We reported that the Mg-Ca dilute alloys can exhibit ultra-fine grain size (less than 1 um) and the exceptionally high yield strength, e.g., similar to 290 MPa in the Mg-0.1 wt% Ca alloy and similar to 377 MPa in Mg-1.0 wt% Ca alloy, achieved by conventional one-step extrusion. Both increased activations of non-basal slips due to Ca addition and the dynamic partitioning of Ca atoms during extrusion are believed to play the critical role in facilitating formation of the submicron matrix grains. Multi-scale substructures, including the ultrafine recrystallized grains, the mono-dispersive Mg-2 Ca nano-phases, residual dislocations and Ca enriched sub-grain boundaries contribute to the high strength.

AB Recently a high interest has grown around the use of organic materials, as cellulose, in engineering and electronic fields due to the possibility to create hybrid devices. The objective of this work was to create a new generation of biocompatible bacterial cellulose Metal Oxides (MOX) gas sensors. ZnO semiconductor sensing material was used due to its well-known functional performances and the UV light activation possibility at room temperature. Bacterial cellulose membranes have been produced, active ZnO layer was deposited and the final sensing device was assembled and tested in presence of different chemical compounds. The prototypes showed good response to nitrogen dioxide, acetone and ethanol at room temperature, demonstrating the possibility to use bacterial cellulose as eco and environmental friendly composite transducers material for, but not limited to, chemical sensors.

AB Developing efficient crop fertilization practices has become more and more important because of their demand for food production was increased. A porous iron-based metal-organic framework (Fe-MOF) was modified with ethylenediaminetetra-acetic dianhydride. The NMR and elemental analysis of the modified material (Fe-MOF-EDTA) show three pathways of modification. Ferrous-ethylenediaminete tra-acetic acid (Fe-EDTA), Fe-MOF and Fe-MOF-EDTA were applied to Phaseolus vulgaris plant in hydroponic culture. The effect of Fe-sources on plant growth rate, chlorophyll contents, protein and antioxidant enzymes activities of Phaseolus vulgaris was monitored. Results confirmed the superior actions of Fe-MOF-EDTA compared with other Fe-sources especially in plant weight, realizing 9.6% enhancement after 96 h of treatment, in addition to chlorophyll content, protein and enzymes activities. Collectively, these data revealed the enrichment effect of Fe-MOF-EDTA component in nutrient solutions which may be adopted as a strategy for improving the growth and quality parameters of Phaseolus vulgaris plants.

AB Room temperature magnetoelectric coupling, magnetic field dependent dielectric and ac electrical properties of xLa(0.7)Sr(0.3)MnO(3) - (1 - x) Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (x = 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7) nanocomposites have been investigated. The magnetoelectric voltage coefficients are found to similar to 0.25 and similar to 0.16 mV/cmOe for transverse and longitudinal configurations. Dielectric constants for all the compositions are increased with increase in magnetic field. Magnetodielectric value is estimated to similar to 16% due to the magnetostriction property of the samples. The fitted value of Nyquist plots reveals the dominant role of the grain boundaries of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 nanoparticles and modified grain boundaries due to Poly(vinylidene fluoride) in the samples. With the application of magnetic field the relaxation frequencies are shifted towards the higher frequency region attributing to the magnetic field dependent relaxation process in the system.

AB Severe Plastic Deformation (SPD) leads to grain refinement and strengthening of metals. The most utilized SPD techniques are Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP), High Pressure Torsion (HPT) and Multi-Axial Compression (MAC). Only MAC allows the determination of the stress-strain curves of the material during processing. Although ECAP and HPT processing has been analyzed in detail, there are few studies of MAC procedures and their consequences. It is shown that only specimens re-machined after each compression lead to adequate MAC stress-strain curves of the material, whose microstructures are not affected by re-machining.

AB Large lateral sized two-dimensional (2-D) colloidal nanocrystals with a uniform thickness are highly desired but difficult to prepare. Herein we demonstrated that colloidal copper (I) sulfide (Cu1.75S) nanoplates with an large lateral dimension, i.e. 200 nm to 1 mu m, can be successfully produced from small Cu2-xS nanoplates via an Ostwald ripening process. The availability of the large lateral sized Cu2-xS nanoplates produced through this approach not only sheds light on the construction of 2-D nanostructures of other systems but also provides a platform for the cation exchange reaction to generate a variety of 2-D nanoplates with large lateral dimensions.

AB In this study, Fe-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) nanocomposite MIL-53(Fe) was developed by a facile solvothermal method, and the effect of synthesis conditions on MIL-53(Fe) was investigated. The as-prepared materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra. Rhodamine B used as a model pollutant to detect the photocatalytic activity of these materials. The best synthesis temperature of MIL-53(Fe) was 150 degrees C and the optimum ratio of FeCl3 center dot 6H(2)O and C8H6O4 was 1:2. SEM results showed that the relatively uniform morphology might be beneficial to the photocatalytic reaction. The results could further support exploitation of experimental conditions for the synthesis of MOFs materials with high catalytic performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The atomic structure of platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) loaded on the carbon black particles was investigated using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Both the side and plan view HRTEM images of the Pt NPs showed the inhomogeneously strained structures. These structures were analyzed by approximating the Pt NPs as monoclinic crystal structures, and no correlation was observed between the monoclinic lattice parameters and the Pt NP diameter. The mean unit cell volume of the Pt NPs was smaller than the unit cell volume of bulk Pt, and approximately 70% of the Pt NPs were compressively strained and the remaining 30% were expansively strained.

AB Low power conversion efficiency represents the main drawback of organic solar cells (OSC) compared to inorganic devices. Therefore, a novel bulk electron transport layer of silver nanostructures (AgNs) inside poly[(9,9-bis(3'-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyL)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] is proposed to be used in OSC. Different concentrations (i.e. 5 and 10% v/v) of AgNs synthesized with a natural extract of Agave tequilana Weber var. Azul as reducing agent were used to improve the performance of the photovoltaic devices. Due to the presence of AgNs, which promote better charge transport, an improvement from 7.04 to 32.16% of the overall performance of the OSC was observed compared to the reference device without nanostructures.

AB We investigated annealing effects on the Ga2O3 thin films deposited on c-sapphire by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition. A metastable Ga2O3 films was deposited on c-sapphire substrate by PEALD with high plasma power at 250 degrees C. The ((2) over bar 01) preferred orientation beta-Ga2O3 films were obtained after annealing in oxygen atmosphere. Structure and surface analysis revealed that the annealed films had more fine-grained surface features. The film annealed for 2 h exhibited the best crystallinity. The bandgap of the as-deposited and annealed films for 2 h were 4.56 and 4.97 eV, respectively. The process of high-temperature annealing contributed gallium, oxygen atoms to obtain enough energy to migrate to the suitable location and increased the vigilance of crystallinity.

TI Fabrication of silk microcapsules by layer-by-layer desolvation

ID SHAPED PARTICLES
AB The procedure to increase shell thickness of multilayer silk microcapsules fabricated by layer-by-layer assembly (LbL assembly) are tedious and time-consuming. To address this, layer-by-layer desolvation (LbL desolvation), a more efficient technique, was developed with PLGA microspheres as sacrificial templates. Due to high efficiency of desolvation in increasing the shell thickness, self-supporting structures were obtained with merely seven silk layers. Permeability of the microcapsules was manipulated with high efficiency as well. Moreover, crosslinking was found to reduce surface charge of the shell. We attributed this to crosslinking-induced conformational change of silk fibroin based on secondary structure analysis. The LbL desolvation technique will facilitate fabrication of multilayer silk microcapsules for biomedical applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tailoring morphology of the support is considered to be an effective way to tune the physicochemical properties of the catalysts. Herein, we have developed a rational strategy combining of electrospinning, hydrothermal and annealing method for the first time to design well-defined hierarchical double-walled Co3O4 hollow nanofibers (CHNFs). This special tailored complicated wall structure leads to a large specific surface area, increased substrate adsorption, and improved mass transfer of reactive species, which can be employed as an ideal support for loading high-dispersed ultrafine Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs). Such a PtNPs/CHNFs catalyst exhibits an excellent catalytic activity and stability toward CO oxidation. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Earth-abundant and non-toxicity quaternary chalcogenide Cu2SrSnS4 is prepared by a facial ball-milling method. Its formation is revealed to be from the reaction between Cu2SnS3 and SrS at 600 degrees C. The bandgap of the prepared Cu2SrSnS4 film is speculated around 1.78 eV according to absorption test. The carrier lifetime of the prepared Cu2SrSnS4 film is about 2.06 ns. The photocurrent density of the Cu2SrSnS4 film is about 150 mu A cm(2) at -670 mV bias vs Ag/AgCl electrode and it repeats after 10 cycles of 1000 s. Its notable generation of photocurrent and photoelectrochemical stability indicates its potential for photoelectric conversion application. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of research is to investigate microstructure evolution, grain growth mechanism and texture evolution of AZ91 magnesium alloy samples treated by equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) using route A. These samples were treated by one-pass and four-pass ECAP, respectively. During subsequent partial remelting, one-pass ECAP formed sample mainly followed Ostwald ripening mechanism. However, grain coalescence was dominant in the four-pass ECAP formed sample. For four-pass ECAP formed sample, texture densities were almost unchanged before and after partial remelting. However, sheet texture promoted grains growth kinetics by coalescence. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Glycidyl azide polymer-hydroxyl terminated polyether semi-interpenetrating polymer network (GAP-HTPE semi-IPN) was successfully fabricated by catalytic urethane reaction of HTPE/isocyanate and azide-alkyne click chemistry of GAP/dimethyl dipropargylmalonate. Concentration of catalyst was adjusted to ensure the synchronization of dual curing system. The curing process was monitored by FTIR and H-1 NMR spectroscopy. The tensile strength and breaking elongation of semi-IPN were 5.72 MPa and 194% respectively without macroscopic phase separation on both curing and fracture surfaces. The decomposition behavior was studied by DSC-TG-PyMS coupling analysis. The sequential stages and increased temperature with remarkable reduction of azide ion gaseous product show good thermal stability. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hierarchical spherical porous carbon (HSPC) is synthesized by adopting a single step soft template method and extensively characterized by XRD, BET surface area, Raman spectroscopy, FE-SEM and HR-TEM analysis. The HSPC electrode outperformed the commercial graphite material at higher current rates when tested for Li-ion battery application. It exhibits superior electrochemical performance such as a high reversible specific capacity of 422 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) and high rate capability of 102 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 5000 mA g(-1) with good cyclic stability. The notably higher electrochemical performance is attributed to the hierarchical porosity which resulted in lower charge-transfer resistance and superior rate performance. The simple synthesis approach and superior rate performance in the present study makes HSPC an alternative anode candidate for rechargeable lithium-ion battery application. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Sheets from Ti alloys like Ti-Nb are attractive as structural and functional components for applications in aerospace, biomedicine or electrochemical devices. Tape casting is a cost-effective production method, which has been widely used for production of ceramic sheets. Ti-Nb alloys are (alpha+ beta)-type alloys, which have the potential for replacing established Ti-6Al-4V alloy in specific cases, e.g. due to not containing toxic elements like vanadium. In the present work, tape casting was introduced as novel strategy for production of thin Ti-Nb sheets. Elemental Ti and Nb powders were used for production of Ti-10wt% Nb alloy sheets with a thickness of around 350 mu m. Sintering behavior and microstructure were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), chemical analysis and X-ray diffraction. A homogeneous (alpha + beta)-type alloy with low residual porosity of ca. 1.5 vol% was achieved by sintering at 1300 degrees C. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this letter, we report an "ultrasonication-free" direct exfoliation method to obtain graphene oxide with large lateral size (LGO). The average size of LGO sheets is about 50 mu m *50 mu m. The g-LGO film shows a superior in-plane thermal conductivity after the graphitization treatment. Furthermore, the in situ "molecular welding", using polyimide (PI) to weld up the GO sheets, is conducted to improve the performance of hybrid thermal conducting film. The thermal conductivity of g-LGO/PI film is 1053.975 +/- 8.762 W m(-1 )K(-1), superior to that of the g-LGO film and g-SGO/Pl. The direct preparation method to obtain GO with large lateral size, followed by such an in situ "molecular welding" strategy by PI, provides a promising way to fabricate graphene-based film for efficient thermal management.

AB The deformation mechanisms in a metastable beta-48.1Zr-43.2Ti-4.5Al-4.2V (wt%) alloy after room-temperature compression to similar to 6% strain were investigated. The results indicated that the alloy deforms primarily by deformation-induced beta ->alpha' martensitic transformation and {10 (1) over bar 2} < 10<(1)over bar> 1 > twinning, and limited deformation-induced beta ->alpha '' martensitic transformation. The {10 (1) over bar 2} < 10<(1)over bar>1 > twinning was formed within the alpha' plate to accommodate the local plastic deformation strain generated in alpha' martensite plate during compression. Such a combination of deformation mechanisms were observed in metastable beta Zr or Ti alloys for the first time, which can aid future development of superior beta Zr alloys displaying a potentially combination of transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) and transformation twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) effects.

AB A series of Sr1-xCaxZnO2:0.02 Eu3+ phosphors have been prepared by solid-state method. The effects of Ca2+ ions on luminescent properties of SrZnO2:0.02 Eu3+ have been systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, the photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra, and International Commission on Illumination (CIE) chromaticity diagram. The red-emitting of Eu3+ doped Sr1-xCaxZnO2 phosphors can be tuned based on the host-sensitized luminescence effect, in which the maximum emission intensity and 90.05% color purity at 396 nm excitation, a broad emission band ranging from 475 to 800 nm at 374 nm excitation have been achieved in the Sr0.85Ca0.15ZnO2:0.02 Eu3+ sample, which demonstrate the occurrence of energy transfer from host to Eu3+ ions. Therefore, Eu3+ doped Sr1-xCaxZnO2 phosphors will become a promising candidate as a new single-host red-emitting phosphor for white LEDs applications. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID WEAR-RESISTANCE; AL-15SI
AB In this paper, the effect of high current pulsed beam (HCPEB) treatment induced nanocrystallization via shock waves in the mechanical properties of Al-15Si alloy was studied in detail. First, many fine nanograins formed on the top surface of the HCPEB-treated hypereutectic Al-15Si alloy and showed radial arrangement around the centre of the crater during the HCPEB process as a result of the impact of the shock wave induced by crater eruption. Second, the cross-section analysis revealed that some platelike eutectic Si phases in the heat-affected zone were broken, which was attributed to the repeated impact of the shock wave under high temperature conditions. Third, many nanograins (Al) were formed in the heat-affected zone, which could be tightly related to the shock wave impact during the HCPEB process. Finally, the mechanical properties of the Al-15Si alloy before and after HCPEB treatment were measured, and the results showed that the tensile strength of the HCPEB-treated Al-15Si alloy increased approximately 41.4% from 138.8 MPa for the initial sample to 196.2 MPa for the modified sample. Therefore, HCPEB treatment is a versatile technique for refining the surface microstructure of hypereutectic Al-Si alloys. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new type of multifunctional magnetic chitosan microspheres based on phase change materials (M-PCM-CTS, M represents magnetic, PCM represents phase change materials and CTS represents chitosan) were designed and synthesized through multi-emulsification and cross-linking method. The chemical compositions and structures of M-PCM-CTS were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Scanning electron microscope (SEM). M-PCM-CTS presented a regular spherical morphology with a uniform diameter of 500 mu m. Thermal analysis indicated that the M-PCM-CTS not only revealed reliable phase change performance with a maximum thermal enthalpy of 80 J/g, but also exhibited various melting and crystallization temperature depending on the length of alkanes chain. The multifunctional microspheres developed in this work would open up a new synthesis route for a wide range of multifunction polymers and finds novel opportunities for use in the fields of thermal energy storage, adsorption and magnetic effectiveness.

AB A photo-assisted deposition method for the deposition of platinum nanoparticles on Fe2O3 nanotubes (Pt/Fe2O3), prepared by anodizing, has been developed. The chemicophysical properties and elemental composition of the synthetic Pt/Fe2O3 samples have also been determined. The investigation of the photoelectrochemical properties of the prepared Pt/Fe2O3 samples showed their greatly increased photocurrent density for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting compared to bare Fe2O3. Therefore, the deposition of Pt is effective on the enhancement of the PEC response. In addition, the effect of the Pt photodeposition time on water splitting capability was studied. The current density produced by sample HPt3 was 220 mu A/cm(2) at +0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is 2 times higher than that of the bare Fe2O3 nanotube samples (105 mu A/cm(2), at +0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl).

AB A novel phase change material based on the clad Al-Si composite ingot with eutectic Al-Si/Si-rich core-shell structure was designed for the high temperature thermal storage. The constructed Al-Si composite with core-shell structure exhibits a high thermal conductivity, large phase change enthalpy, and excellent cycling performance. Due to the spheroidized primary Si particles and continuous alpha-Al matrix in the Si-rich layer, the Al-Si composite ingot holds a good shape-stable property at 650 degrees C, which prevents the leakage of eutectic Al-Si melt during thermal cycling. Therefore, this novel clad Al-Si composite is a promising material for high temperature thermal storage, which may be directly used as an actual thermal storage device without containers.

AB Co3O4 nanocrystalline-assembled mesoporous hollow polyhedron nanocage-in-nanocage is synthesized through a metal-organic-framework-engaged strategy that relies on the unique chemical reactivity properties of zeolitic imidazolate framework-67. As anode material for lithium ion batteries, Co3O4 nanocagein-nanocage shows high specific capacity (1271 mAh g(-1) at 0.1C at the 2nd cycle) and good cycling stability (the capacity retention of 81.6% after 100 cycles), which can be attributed to beneficial effects of Co3O4 nanocrystalline and the mesoporous hollow nanocage-in-nanocage structure.

The average grain size of Cr-rich particles was refined to similar to 40 nm, and the solid solubility limit of Cr in Cu was extended to 1.96 at. %. Experimental results show that the dispersion of nano-sized Cr-rich spheroids in Cu-rich matrix was attributed to the Brownian motion of Cr-rich spheroids, and the high cooling rate (5.75 x 10(6) K/s) during liquid phase separation which inhibits the collisions between Cr-rich spheroids.

The dimple structure on the fracture surface is quantified and the nucleation of void is examined. The deformation twins can provide more sites for void nucleation and constrain shape change of the voids. Even under the low stress-triaxiality, the void can coalesce to reach large size accompanying twinning. The evolution of void size and density deduced from the fractograph is important to quantify ductile fracture of HEA. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Olivine-type LiNiPO4 and their corresponding Nd3+ doped LiNiPO4 cathode materials were synthesized through polyol process with 1, 2 propane-diol as the medium. The inclusion of Nd3+ to LiNiPO4 significantly enhanced the electronic conductivity by two orders as compared to bare LiNiPO4. The cyclic voltammograms revealed that the rare earth doped LiNiPO4 electrode improved the electrochemical properties. The single cell consisting of 0.07 mol% Nd3+ doped samples showed the highest specific capacity of 95.2 mAh g(-1) at low current rate, which makes Nd3+ doped LiNiPO4 a prime candidate for high potential lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).

ID MICROSTRUCTURAL EVOLUTION
AB This study mainly investigates the influence of artificial aging at 480 degrees C, 520 degrees C and 620 degrees C on the microstructure and mechanical properties of metal injection molding (MIM) 17-4PH. The results show the microstructure of the as-sintered MIM 17-4PH to be mainly composed of lath martensite, delta-ferrite, and nodular SiO2 inclusions. The effect of precipitation hardening is to strengthen the MIM 17-4PH by the precipitation of a large number of fine spherical epsilon-Cu phases on the lath martensite matrix, which effectively block the movement of dislocations. The highest hardness is obtained by artificial aging at 480 degrees C for 4 h. As the aging temperature increases, the epsilon-Cu phase grows coarser, which results in over aging of the MIM 17-4PH and decreases the hardness. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bimetallic Fe(III) doped ZnO (FZO) nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized to be utilized as heterogeneous nano-catalysts. The synthesized NPs were characterized using various physical techniques. Average particle size and surface area of NPs were found to be 76.24 +/- 17 nm, and 12.39 m(2) g (1), respectively. Designed nano-catalyst was found to be soft ferromagnetic in nature, with 1.32 +/- 0.2 emu g (1) magnetization and 75.52 +/- 2 Oe coercivity. FZO NPs indicated efficient transesterification reaction using soybean oil and methanol. The biodiesel was produced within 3 h, and was found to be remarkably rich in C-18 methyl esters. The heterogeneous catalyst was recovered around 90 +/- 2% and exhibited excellent transesterification ability upon its reuse. Therefore, the present study postulates the designed bimetallic FZO NPs as a potential heterogonous nano-catalyst for the efficient production of biodiesel. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, a lanthanum cobaltite (LCO) "self-pulverisation" mechanism was investigated in an attempt use a novel concept when developing materials. The results confirmed that hydroxylation of a small amount of excessive La2O3 in LCO into La(OH)(3) caused self-pulverisation of bulk LCO, which initially had a high mechanical strength, into very fine powders within a few weeks, from which cracks initiated and propagated. Other conventional oxides, such as stabilised zirconia. Intentionally added with the La2O3, were prepared and their self-pulverisation phenomena were demonstrated. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Anti-fouling and anti-bacteria are important virtues to help reduce membrane contamination and prolong membrane lifetime. Herein, we report a robust superhydrophobic poly (lactic acid) membrane with biomimetic urchin-like hierarchical surface structure which shows excellent anti-wetting character without fluorine components involved. Isopropanol, an incompatible solvent for poly (lactic acid), was introduced into the casting solution to tune the crystal behavior of polymer phase and thus the urchin-like microstructure was finally evolved during the phase inversion. The as-prepared membrane surface showed self-cleaning character and better superhydrophobic stability. It also exhibited high resistance to protein and Escherichia coli adhesion. This work inspires us a new strategy to fabricate anti-bacteria membrane based on surface texture design, instead of introduction of anti-bacteria agents. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Al,Ga co-doped ZnO thin films were deposited on to glass substrates by aerosol assisted chemical transport (AACT) and were studied for application as transparent thin film heaters. The film thickness was around 400 nm after 60 min of AACT deposition; this gave a sheet resistance of 142.5 Omega/sq, which corresponded to a resistivity of 5.7 x 10(3) Omega.cm. The thin films exhibited a maximum transmittance of 90% in the visible region. A mean temperature of 132.3 degrees C was reached after applying a voltage of 18 V for 10 min, giving a power consumption of 2.11 W. These results could provide a possibility to use Al,Ga co-doped ZnO thin films as transparent heaters to replace the more expensive indium tin oxide. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cu-containing Mg alloys are a novel type of antibacterial biomaterial based on biodegradation of Mg and antibacterial functions of Cu. However, fast degradation limits their clinical application. For the first time, this work utilizes the synergistic effects of biodegradation of ZK30, antibacterial function of Cu and grain refinement by selective laser melting (SLM) to prepare high-performance antibacterial ZK30-Cu alloys. The obtained alloys have an improved biodegradation resistance, which is attributed to remarkable grain refinement by SLM. Furthermore, the alloys exhibit good antibacterial ability and cytocompatibility. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An eco-friendly post-drawing process without any chemical solvents for splitting orange (segmented) pie bicomponent multifilaments (OP bico fibers) from biodegradable poly(lactic acid) (PLA) und polypropylene (PP) is developed. Emphasis of the study is given on understanding thermal behavior of the PLA and PP during heating and cooling processes. Due to the differences in their thermal behavior, particular crystallization behavior, PLA and PP in OP bico fibers split from each other during drawing under heat treatment only and become ultrafine fibers special cross-sections and very large surface area. Furthermore, these post-drawn fibers possess very high tensile strength at 51.0 cN/Tex, which is 1.7 times higher than pure PLA fibers and three times as high as that of melt spun bico fibers.

AB 205A aluminum thin wall part was additively manufactured using cold metal transfer (CMT) equipment. The influence of alpha-Al grains, Al2Cu phase, and pore characteristics on the in-situ tensile behavior was investigated. The experimental results show an enhancement in the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) in the as-deposited sample, as compared to its as-cast counterpart. This can be largely attributed to the presence of the refined alpha-Al grains more than dot-like Al2Cu phase. A slightly deteriorated plasticity was observed, which was mainly related to micro-scaled spherical pores with a relatively high porosity of 3.51%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, luminescent bioplastic composite filaments for 3D printing were fabricated from polylactic acid (PLA) and samarium doped magnesium aluminate phosphor (MgAl2O4:Sm3+). The phosphor was prepared by a metal-complex decomposition method. The obtained powder was then modified by 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane to improve compatibility with PLA matrix. Untreated and treated phosphors exhibited characteristic photoluminescent (PL) peaks of Sm3+ ion. Composite filaments of PLA with different amounts of phosphors (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 phr) were produced by an extrusion process. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) scans have revealed that the phosphor fillers lowered glass-transition (T-g), crystallization (T-c), and melting (T-m) temperatures of the PLA. PL measurements have shown luminescent properties of 3D printed samples resembling those of phosphor powders. Luminescent intensity was increased with the increasing ratio of phosphors. The phosphors not only developed luminescence but also strengthened mechanical properties of the composites. Furthermore, surface modification was able to improve the mechanical properties of the composite filaments as evident in a series of mechanical tests. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB AgNbO3-based ceramics are promising lead-free anti-ferroelectric (AFE) materials for high power energy application. Herein, enhanced energy storage performance was obtained in BiMnO3 modified AgNbO3 ceramics. It was found that the introduction of BiMnO(3)leads to decreased tolerance factor, which is responsible for the enhanced AFE stability. The enhanced AFE stability causes reduced remnant polarization (P-r) and increased AFE-FE phase transition fields (E-F/E-A), which is beneficial for the energy storage performance. Better recoverable energy storage density (W-rec) of 2.4 J/cm(3) at 175 kV/cm was achieved in AgNbO3-0.6 mol% BiMnO3 ceramics, which is due to the enhanced AFE stability. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that this sensor exhibited both excellent sensitivity (limit of detections ranging from 0.035 to 0.11 mg/m(3)) with fast response and recovery and high selectivity (2.23-49.6 times higher response than interference vapors) toward VOSCs at room temperature. The good performance is attributed to the hydrogen bonding between the sulfur atom of VOSCs and hydrogen atom of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) groups in polymer chain. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrum and first principle calculations were performed to further support this proposed mechanism. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The coalescence of two parallel and contacting amorphous SiOx nanowires (a-SiOx NWs) as induced by uniform electron beam irradiation was in situ studied at room temperature in a transmission electron microscope. It was observed that during the irradiation the two parallel and contacting NWs exhibited a rapid athermal coalescence at and near the contacting surface and finally evolved into a single NW with a bigger diameter where atom loss during the coalescence process was not observed. Based on atom diffusion and plastic flow driven by effect of nanocurature of the a-SiOx NWs, and effect of athermal activation induced by the electron beam, a new mechanism was proposed to elucidate the experimental phenomena.

ID FABRICATION
AB Flower-like core-shell MnO2-coated carbon aerogels (CS@MnO2) were prepared via a facile hydrothermal process. CS@MnO2 composites can remove dyes from aqueous solution, such as Methylene blue (MB), Congo red (CR), and Rhodamine B (RhB). CS@MnO2 presents an excellent decolorization effect of anionic and cationic dyes. Notably, the maximum decolorization rate for cationic dyes reached 99.5% (wt%), together with a decolorization rate of 90% for the anionic dye. Our work not only developed CS@MnO2 core-shell nanospheres as a superior photocatalyst, but also provided a new strategy for many other related applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Two-dimensional layers of metal dichalcogenides have attracted much attention because of their ultrathin thickness and potential applications in electronics and optoelectronics. In this regard, we further explore the optoelectronic properties of monolayer MoS2 synthesized by chemical vapor deposition on sapphire substrate and contacted the Au electrode by lithographie method for applications in photodetectors. The device exhibits broadband photoresponse (UV-Vis-NIR), a lower subthreshold swing (0.5 V), higher detectivity (10(10) Jones) and superior responsivity (0.0084 A/W). We believe that this work provides important scientific insights for photoelectric response properties of emerging atomically layered 2D materials for optoelectronic applications.

AB It was recently reported that segregation of Zr to grain boundaries (GB) in nanocrystalline Cu can lead to the development of disorder in the intergranular structure (Khalajhedayati et al., 2016; Khalajhedayati and Rupert, 2015). In this study we employ atomistic computer simulations to investigate how this disorder affects dislocation nucleation from the GBs under applied stress. It was found that a fully disordered grain boundary structure suppresses dislocation emission and significantly increases the yield stress. Depending on the solute concentration and heat-treatment, however, partial disorder may also occur and this aids dislocation nucleation rather than suppressing it, reducing or eliminating the strengthening effect.

AB Although different kinds of metal materials have been built in the past years, it is difficult to fabricate the components of copper alloys with high strength and high conductivity due to their high reflectivity and thermal conductivity. In this paper, Cu-Cr alloy with high strength and high conductivity was successfully manufactured by high laser power selective laser melting. The microstructure, mechanical properties and conductivity were studied and compared before and after the heat treatment. The microstructure of the as-built sample was columnar grains with very fine cellular sub-structures and precipitates of Cr and Cr2O3. After heat treatment, the Cr particles precipitated from Cu matrix, resulting in simultaneous increase in strength and conductivity. The ultimate tensile strength of 468 MPa, yield strength of 377.33 MPa, and electrical conductivity of 98.31% IACS were achieved, which is even better than the samples fabricated by rolling with post heat treatment.

AB TiO2 nanorods were prepared by hydrothermal method over TiO2 seed layers deposited by DC Sputtering. From the XRD structural characterization, it has been stated that TiO2 seed layer present mainly the anatase phase with some contributions of rutile phase, while for TiO2 nanorods, the rutile phase is present. The thin film thickness were measured using a profilometer, resulting in a thickness of 310 nm for the seed layer and similar to 400 nm for TiO2 nanorods. PL analysis for both films presented an indirect transitions Gamma(1b) -> X-2a, as well as oxygen vacancies, defects and surface states. Photocatalytic H-2 production for TiO2 seed layer film was around 38 mu mol, while TiO2 nanorods produced 132 mu mol. This is attributed to the increase to the midgap states present below the conduction band and near to the valence band, which help to improve the photocatalytic activity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Tb-Dy-Fe-Co nanowires have been fabricated into anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates by direct-current (DC) electrodeposition. The results show that there are amorphous structures in the asdeposited Tb-Dy-Fe-Co nanowires. Due to the induced co-deposition of Fe-Co phase, the rare earth elements terbium and dysprosium can be deposited in AAO templates, and the stepped phase distribution can be observed in the annealed Tb-Dy-Fe-Co nanowires. It can be seen from the hysteresis loops that the coercivity of annealed nanowires is significantly improved, showing remarkable hard magnetic properties. When the concentration of Tb3+ is 0.04 mol/L and Dy3+ is 0.002 mol/L, the magnetic properties of the Tb-Dy-Fe-Co nanowires are improved significantly. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) has been successfully synthesized by a solvothermal method using 1, 8-Diazabicyclo [5.4.0] undec-7-ene as the catalyst. The crystal structure and the morphology of FePc powder were systematically characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra and field emission scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectrometer, respectively. The FePc with a pure beta phase is observed with a large yield up to 80%. It shows a rod-like shape in the microstructure. The length is in the range of 200-600 mu m and the width is of 5-20 mu m.

ID IRON
AB Degradable iron (Fe) based materials have been widely investigated for fracture fixation to overcome complications of permanent implants. Our study is focused on the development of a new Fe-Mn-Cu alloy with enhanced antimicrobial properties. In this work, Fe-Mn-Cu alloys, with up to 10 wt% copper (Cu), were prepared by powder metallurgy route. Degradation behaviour of the alloys were studied using potentiodynamic polarization test which showed nearly about 6 times increase in corrosion rate for 10 wt% Cu compared to the base alloy. Addition of Cu has significantly increased microhardness for up to 5 wt% and decreased thereafter. Broth micro-dilution test showed increased antimicrobial activity with Cu addition in Fe-Mn alloy while in vitro cytocompatibility study showed more than 70% cell viability for all alloys. Present study indicates that Cu alloying in Fe-Mn makes it a suitable material for internal fracture fixation devices with enhanced antimicrobial properties. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A tungsten-copper functionally graded material was processed based on SLM additive manufacture despite encountering some difficulties from materials characters. The effect of laser parameter on the interfacial defects and bonding performance are evaluated. The SLM produced tungsten is in columnar structures with random orientation. Plenty of fine tungsten grains are present at the bonding region, owing to a high cooling rate incited by the underlying copper. A metallurgically bonded interface with a 50-80 mu m inter-diffusion region is formed. The interfacial bonding mechanism, which associates with intense Marangoni convection at the interface, is revealed and discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Solar and luminous light transmission control using Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) based PV glazing systems (15 cm x 15 cm x 0.6 cm) were evaluated in this work. Indoor spectral characterisation showed that average solar transmission for investigated three different CdTe glazing systems were 5.77% (CdTe1), 9.54% (CdTe2) and 12.34% (CdTe3). Spectral behaviour of reflections in the range of solar and visible wavelengths was similar for these three different transparent CdTe glazing. Near infrared (NIR) reflection was higher compared to luminous reflection after 1500 nm for all three glazing systems. Solar factor (SF) for CdTe1, CdTe2 and CdTe3 glazing were 0.23, 0.28, 0.26. CdTe3 is the best candidate for glazing application as it has 113% higher luminous transmission while SF only increases by 21% compared to CdTe1. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Porous three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical flower-like SnO2 nanomaterials were successfully synthesized via facile hydrothermal method combined with subsequent annealing process. Characterization analysis shows that the porous 3D SnO(2)consists of a number of thin nanosheets with pores. Gas sensing properties indicate that the porous 3D SnO2 sensor has lower initial response temperature and optimal working temperature, better linearity in a certain range of gas concentration, better stability and selectivity to methane. Implies that porous 3D SnO2 nanomaterials will be promising candidates for methane sensors. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Lithiation, sodiation, and potassiation usually induce volume expansion to the host structure due to the insertion of alkali metal ions into the host structure. Here we report an unusual volume shrinkage phenomenon during the potassiation of CuO nanowires. The volume shrinkage is caused by an "oxygen pump" and an electrochemically driven Kirkendall effect, in which the O-2 ions in the CuO lattice and the K+ migrate asymmetrically under external electric field due to their different mass-to-charge ratio. This is the first direct observation on the "oxygen pump" and electrochemical Kirkendall effect induced volume shrinkage phenomenon, which reveals peculiar ion transport characteristic during electrochemical reactions.

AB Digital construction has recently become the subject of very rapidly growing research activities all over the world. In this regard, our current research demonstrates the possibility of using high volume fly ash mortar, modified with micro silica for 3D concrete printing application. To assess the effect of the micro silica on rheological performance, a rotational rheometer was used to measure yield stress, viscosity and reversible stiffening behavior of ternary blends of fly ash-cement-micro silica. Since, the disposal of fly ash from coal power plants has increased rapidly due to the feed-in tariff established by the government, this research will pave a way to utilize high volume of fly ash for digital construction application.

However, how to disperse the graphene uniformly and retain its structure integrity in the metal matrix is so challenging and crucial to the performance of MMCGs. This work designed a novel, single-step and cost-effective route based on a magnesiothermic reaction, which constructs a core-shell structure with sphere Ti core and graphene shell, to solve this problem perfectly. This route also provides a new strategy to obtain high-performance metal@graphene core-shell material that widely used in mechanical components, catalytic and electronic industries, etc. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant attention due to their excellent efficiency reaching 22.1% in just the past few years. Despite their high efficiency, the limited long-term stability of PSCs has to be overcome. Moisture environments has been recognized as a main degradation pathway of perovskite materials.

AB Geographical traceability is critical to the commercial viability of the highly valued Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis). This study examined the possibility of utilizing a combination of multi-element and stable isotope analysis, together with multivariate statistical authenticity analysis, to identify the origins of 164 commodity crabs (using the third pereiopod as the sample material) from eight sites around China. The delta C-13, delta N-15 values and the Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, Mn, Cu, Zn, Sr, Ba contents differed significantly depending on the crabs' origin. The linear discriminant analysis showed that 99.4% of the samples were correctly classified and the cross-validated accuracy rate was 98.2%. Meanwhile, the support vector machine exhibited high discrimination ability with 99.4% accuracy. This study provides a non-conventional, integrated approach for determining the traceability of E. sinensis. This method offers the potential of being able to identify an even more diverse geographical range of E. sinensis origins.

AB In view of the significant risk of heavy metal ions on human health, effective determination method is quite urgent. Herein, a single-walled carbon nanohorns modified screen-printed electrode was proposed as a disposable electrochemical sensor. The electrochemical study reveals that the developed electrode possesses excellent electrochemical activity. By combination of bismuth film, the electrochemical sensor exhibits distinct and detached stripping peaks towards cadmium and lead. Under the optimized conditions, the linear range of the single-walled carbon nanohorns film modified electrode for both heavy metal ions varied from 1.0 to 60.0 mu g L-1. The detection limit of cadmium (II) and lead (II) ions was 0.2 mu g L-1 and 0.4 mu g L-1. Furthermore, the determination of cadmium (II) and lead (II) ions in honey and milk samples illustrates the prepared electrochemical sensor possesses excellent practicability for determining cadmium (II) and lead (II) ions in a low levels (mu g L-1).

AB Gelatin is commonly used in food supplements and in the form of soft or hard capsules. The source of gelatins is usually from porcine and bovine, and less commonly from vegetable and fish. Nevertheless, these different origins of gelatin have much similarity in term of structures, physicochemical properties and amino acid sequences. Due to these reasons, differentiation of the source of gelatins has been very difficult. In our present study, differentiation of sources of gelatin was made possible in a simplified yet economical method. Sample was prepared using ammonium sulfate precipitation and subjected to gel electrophoresis for protein separation. We have found a fraction of proteins which is able to differentiate porcine and bovine gelatins accurately, with distinctive protein bands in SDS-PAGE at 140 kDa and 110 kDa for bovine and porcine samples, respectively. This method was verified by 13 double-blinded gelatin samples, all the 13 samples were accurately identified.

AB The analytical features of MP-AES for the determination of Mn in wine were studied as compared with ICP-OES. The optimum spectral line (403.076 nm) of MP-AES was different from that (259.373 nm) of ICP-OES. Significant matrix effect was observed with MP-AES, but not with ICP-OES. A simple and cost-effective MP-AES for the quantitation of Mn in wild grape (Vitis coignetiae) red wines were developed and validated. A standard addition method was used to compensate the matrix effects. The sensitivity of MP-AES was comparable to that of ICP-OES. MP-AES was sensitive, precise, accurate and reliable. The Mn concentration in the wild grape wines was in the range of 502-3627 mu g L-1. MP-AES had a distinct drawback of low matrix tolerance. However, MP-AES had a clear advantage of the low running cost due to the use of nitrogen gas generated from air with a nitrogen generator.

AB Saw palmetto extract (SPE) has many pharmacological effects. Thus, its demand and value has increased steadily, along with the presence of counterfeit SPEs on the market.
   In this work bulk delta C-13, delta H-2, delta O-18 and fatty acid delta C-13, delta H-2 analysis was performed in 20 authentic and 9 commercial SPEs, 12 meat fats and 4 pure fatty acids.
   Authentic SPEs are characterised by bulk values from -31.0 parts per thousand to -29.7 parts per thousand for delta C-13, -176 parts per thousand to -165 parts per thousand for delta H-2, 27.2 parts per thousand to 40.7 parts per thousand for delta O-18, and values of capric, caprylic, lauric, myristic, palmitic and oleic acids from -37.4 parts per thousand to -30.5 parts per thousand for delta C-13 and -187 parts per thousand to -136 parts per thousand for delta H-2. The isotopic values of all the commercial SPEs were out of these ranges and more similar to those of meat fat and pure fatty acids.
   Stable isotope ratio analysis can therefore be proposed as a suitable tool for detecting adulteration in SPEs.

AB Worldwide, mass spectrometry is widely used to detect and quantify food allergens, especially in complex and processed food products. Yet, the absence of a regulatory framework for the developed methods has led to a lack of harmonization between laboratories. In this study, ten allergens were analyzed in eight food products by UHPLC-MS/MS, in order to establish criteria for the retention time, variation tolerance, the ion ratio deviation, and the signal-to-noise ratio for allergen detection. The set of criteria should help laboratories to compare results and avoid false positives and negatives. Furthermore, a strategy combining standard addition and labeled peptide correction was used to quantify milk, soy, peanut, and egg allergens in eight food products. This strategy is particularly interesting for routine laboratories, which receive hundreds of samples and cannot use an external calibration curve for each sample.

AB Monitoring yogurt fermentation by the image analysis of diffraction patterns generated by the laser-milk interaction was explored. Cow's, goat's and sheep's milks were tested. Destructive physico-chemical analyses were done after capturing images during the processes to study the relationships between data blocks. Information from images was explored by applying a spectral phasor from which regions of interest were determined in each image channel. The histograms of frequencies from each region were extracted, which showed evolution according to textural modifications. Examining the image data by multivariate analyses allowed us to know that the captured variance from the diffraction patterns affected both milk type and texture changes. When regression studies were performed to model the physico-chemical parameters, satisfactory quantifications were obtained (from R-2 = 0.82 to 0.99) for each milk type and for a hybrid model that included them all. This proved that the studied patterns had a common fraction of variance during this processing, independently of milk type.

AB A single-drop microextraction method followed by gas chromatography-electron capture detection was developed to determine acrylamide in food samples. Acrylamide was extracted by water and derivatized by hydrobromic acid in the presence of ammonium peroxydisulfate. The derivatization was carried out at 45 degrees C in 15 min using 46 mu L of hydrobromic acid and 98 mg of ammonium peroxydisulfate. A 3.0-mL volume of the derivatized analyte was extracted using a 1.0-mu L n-octanol droplet hanging from the needle tip of a GC microsyringe. After extraction, the extract was injected into the gas chromatograph. The influence of experimental parameters effective on derivatization reaction yield and extraction performance was studied. The limit of detection and quantification, relative standard deviation and linearity of the method were 0.60 mu g/L, 2.0 mu g/L,< 6.0%, and 2.0-100.0 mu g/L, respectively. The method was utilized to determine acrylamide in three food samples (i.e., bread, potato chips and cookie).

AB There is an increasing concern about the negative impacts of veterinary drugs in beehive compartments. This study evaluates the presence and distribution of chemical residues in beeswax, bee bread and honey and determinates in what extension honeybees are exposed to them. Samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS with a wide scope of 322 chemical residues. Samples were collected from apiaries located in rural and forest areas, showing no difference in contamination of phytosanitary applications. Residues of acaricides used for sanitary treatments, coumaphos and two transformation products of amitraz (DMF and DMPF), were quantified at higher levels in wax and bee bread than in honey in most cases. Coumaphos, DMF and DMPF were detected in honey in the range 6-36 mu g.kg(-1); 45-541 mu g.kg(-1); 15-107 mu g.kg(-1), respectively. All, except one sample, were below the EU MRLs, 396/2005 Regulation. Other pesticide residues were detected in beeswax and bee bread at various levels.

AB The objective of this work was to characterize Maillard-derived reactive carbonyl species (RCS) involved in the thermal generation of the popcorn smelling compound, 2-acetylpyridine and develop a targeted approach to optimize the RCS composition and reaction yield. Formation of 2-acetylpyridine from the reaction of glucose and proline was investigated using the carbon module labeling technique and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Incorporation of C3 transient carbonyl compounds was identified as the main route of 2-acetylpyridine formation. Further isotope labeling experiments were carried out to characterize the RCS composition of the reaction mixture using liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry. 1,3-Dihydroxyacetone and acetol, were suggested as key precursors of 2-acetylpyridine. The formation of these specific RCS was subsequently optimized using response surface methodology and a pre-thermal reaction, that ultimately resulted in a 2-fold increase in 2-acetylpyridine. In summary, RCS were demonstrated as a new control point for reaction flavor development.

AB Volatile compounds formed in model reactions involving synthesized initial Maillard intermediates Gly-Amadori and [C-13(5)]-2-threityl-thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acids ([C-13(5)]-TTCA) in different molar ratios and free cysteine and glycine were investigated by solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-olfactometry. The 1:1 ratio composition pattern provided the highest yields of all the sulfur-containing compounds, the potent meaty flavors or their C-13-labeled/unlabeled fractions, indicating a moderate level of glycine relative to cysteine was optimum for maximally yielding meaty flavors in complex meat-like Maillard systems containing cysteine as well as glycine. In addition, the 1:1 ratio composition led to formation of C-13-labeled molecules of some key meaty flavors e.g. 2-furanthiol representing over 70%, indicating TTCA/glycine reaction was better than Gly-Amadori/cysteine to yield meaty flavors. Formation pathways of twenty-nine flavors were elucidated based on the detected isotope distribution patterns. In particular, 2-methylte-trahydrothiophen-3-one, 3-thiophenethiol, 2-ethylthiophene, 2,5-dimethylthiophene, and 5-methylthiophene-2-carboxaldehyde involved a new formation pathway. Thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde and 2-methylthieno[ 3,2-b] thiophene showed two formation pathways.

AB The speciation of Cu and Fe in wine was assessed by a number of methodologies and those with superior performance were utilised on 49 wines and compared to compositional data. The adopted analytical strategies were stripping potentiometry, HPLC and an extraction (solid-phase or liquid-liquid) followed by atomic absorption or optical emission spectroscopic measurement. Stripping potentiometry was specific for sulfide-bound Cu in wines, and showed that this was the predominant form of Cu. A solid phase extraction technique provided a hydrophobic fraction of Cu that was specific for sulfide-bound Cu in white wine but red wine matrix effects hindered isolation of sulfide-bound Cu. The other methods assessed either perturbed the sulfide-bound Cu or were not sufficiently sensitive. The solid phase extraction method enabled routine fractionation of Fe in red and white wines whilst the additional techniques surveyed either measured total Fe or suffered from background contamination.

AB The formation pattern of off-flavor compounds induced by water migration in sea cucumber peptide powders (SCPPs) stored at 25 degrees C and 75% RH for 24 h and 80 days were investigated. Water migration characteristic of SCPPs was monitored by LF-NMR. The effect of water migration on structure and morphology were analyzed by SEM, CD, and FTIR, respectively. The antioxidant activity of SCPPs was detected by EPR. Volatiles generated from SCPPs were detected by P&T-GC-MS. The antioxidant activity of SCPPs declined and structure exhibited abnormalities during the storage. After 24 h of storage, kinds of aldehydes decreased and the content of alcohols increased obviously. After 80 days, (Z)-3,5-dimethyl-2-(1-propenyl)-pyrazine and 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid-bis(2-methylpropyl) ester were identified as the characteristic off-flavor. These off-flavor compounds were probably formed through Maillard reaction. esterification, and microbial metabolism. This study can provide a basis for further exploration of the off-flavor formation mechanism.

AB A simple, quick, cheap and green dispersive solid phase extraction (dSPE) method followed by benzoyl chloride pre-column derivatisation for HPLC-UV determination of twelve biogenic amines (BAs) in wines is proposed for the first time. The dSPE using a strong cation exchange resin increased the selectivity and sensitivity of the analysis by elimination of interfering compounds and a five-fold enrichment of BAs. The method presented an adequate precision and linearity with detection limits ranging from 0.133 to 0.509 mg/L. Recoveries ranging from 72 to 99% prove the accuracy of the method for determining BAs in red, white and Tawny Port wine samples yielding chromatograms clean from interferents. The method was applied successfully to the analysis of 31 young red wines from different Portuguese wine regions. The dSPE method although has a potential of broader application to other food matrixes, other derivatisation procedures than benzoyl chloride and other detectors.

AB The present study was conducted for developing a new method to reduce the tannins content of Xuan Mugua fruits. Lactic acid bacteria fermentation-like incubation was explored as an efficient method to reduce the astringency of Mugua fruits by reducing tannins content. To ensure the efficient removal of tannins, the fermentation conditions were optimized such as temperature, time, and ratio of bacteria to Mugua. Bacteria were able to reduce 78% of the tannins content in Mugua under the optimized conditions as assessed by the methylcellulose perceptible tannins assay. Meanwhile, the active components including polysaccharides, triterpenes, and antioxidants of Mugua with bacterial incubation were also explored, which showed the significant decrease compared to non-fermented Mugua. However, the trend for flavor components was different. This research provides a natural method to solve the astringency problem of these fruits and it will extend their application in food industry.

AB Fatty acid profiles and distribution among lipid classes in the edible parts of seven commonly consumed marine fishes in Chile were investigated. Peruvian morwong, Chilean jack mackerel and Pacific sandperch were found to be the richest sources of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with 440.2, 343.7 and 313.9 mg EPA + DHA/100 g raw fillet respectively among the studied fishes. DHA was mainly found in the phospholipid fraction in all cases, following EPA the same trend except for Pacific sandperch, Chilean hake (most EPA in triacylglycerols) and Peruvian morwong (most EPA as free fatty acid). A very favorable n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio was found in all studied species, and PUFA/SFA ratios ranged between 0.94 and 1.72, which is desirable to keep a healthy cardiovascular status. This is the first study reporting fatty acid profiles and distribution of commonly consumed marine fishes in Chile.

AB The unique aroma of the Hanzhong black tea is due to the special location of the harvesting place and specific manufacturing processes. In this study, a solid phase extraction method (SPE) as sample preparation tool was combined with gas chromatography (GC) as separation technique and several detection systems such as mass spectrometry (MS), flame ionization (FID) and olfactometry (O), which, together with sensorial analysis were used to characterize aroma compounds in Hanzhong black tea infusion. Seventy three aroma compounds were identified and quantified in the tea infusion by the GC-MS and GC-FID methods, respectively. Among them, odor perceptions of 24 compounds were characterized by the GC-O analysis. It was found that linalool oxide I, II and III, E,E-2,4-nonadienal, 4,5-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-2,5-dihydrofuran-2-one, 1-octen-3-one, E,Z-2,6-nonadienal, bis(2-methyl-3-furyl) disulfide had higher odor activity value in the tea infusion and offered floral, fatty, and caramel, mushroom, cucumber, and cooked beef -like odors, respectively. Overall, floral and mushroom and caramel -like odors significantly dominated in the Hanzhong black tea infusion.

AB Immature coffee cherries produce roast coffees with lower hedonic scores than those produced from mature cherries, but variation in volatile and sensory characteristics over a range of maturities is not well studied. In this work, cherries from two coffee cultivars (Caturra, Catimor) were sorted into seven maturity stages from fully immature (Stage 1, green) to fully overripe (Stage 7, purple). Volatile profiles of Stage 1 roast coffee had lower concentrations of carbohydrate degradation products and higher concentrations of N-heterocycles and phenols. Differences in volatiles among Stage 2 (partially immature, yellow-green) and subsequent stages were insignificant (p > 0.05) or else minor. Principle component analysis of the volatile data set also distinguished Stage 1 from other stages. Similarly, a trained cupping panel reported significantly lower sensory scores for Stage 1 as compared to Stages 2-7, but few differences among Stages 2-7. Thus, partially mature and overripe cherries may be appropriate for specialty coffee.

AB The effect of microchip-pulsed electric field (MPEF) and high temperature short time sterilization (HTST) technologies on microbiological, physicochemical properties and flavor of freshly squeezed blueberry juice were compared. Under the MPEF treatment at 350 V, total plate count, total yeast and molds were completely inactivated, meanwhile, Vitamin C, anthocyanin, total phenols, titratable acid and color had no significantly changes. During storage of 30 days at 4 degrees C, Vitamin C decreased by 11.52% and 26.78% after MPEF and HTST treatments, all treated juices showed to be microbiologically safe, whereas MPEF can protect nutritionally related properties and color of blueberry juice samples more efficiently. Besides, relatively small changes of juice in odor, taste and volatile compounds concentration was observed by MPEF treatment. Hence, application of MPEF may be an ideal alternative treatment to HTST processing in order to ensure longer shelf life, higher functional and nutritional values of blueberry juice.

   PERSPECTIVES
AB 3-Monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD) is a common food processing contaminant and a simple, rapid, sensitive and low cost monitoring technology is needed due to its potential carcinogenic nature. Carbon dots directly intercepted on filter paper provide high fluorescence intensity and can be adapted for use as a sensor. We synthesized a carbon dot-filter paper in combination with a molecularly imprinted polymeric film to extract 3-MCPD from samples. This grafted paper-based sensor exhibited a high adsorption capacity (68.97 mg g(-1)), an excellent selectivity (imprinting factor = 4.5) and a low detection limit (0.6 ng mL(-1)). Recoveries ranged from 97.2% to 105.3% with relative standard deviations < 5.6%. The results obtained using this method were linearly correlated to those of the classic GC-MS method (r = 0.998). Based on the Chinese National Standard, this study provides a novel and powerful platform for the simple, rapid, sensitive and on-site analysis of 3-MCPD in soy sauce.

AB We found that nitrite after protonation can react with amine radical on citric acid/ethylenediamine carbon nanodots (CA/EDA-CDs) to form nitrosamines, and fluorescence quenching of CA/EDA-CDs occurred during this process. Using the reaction mechanism a fluorescence quenching capillary analysis (FQCA) was developed. After optimized reaction conditions, the following results were obtained: the required concentration of CA/EDA-CDs was 12 mg/L, HCl concentration was 32 mmol/L, and the reaction conducted in room temperature for 20 min. Under optimized conditions, FQCA has a linear response in 20-500 mu g/L in which RSD was less 4.5% (n = 11), the detection limit was 6.5 mu g/L and the recovery was in 95-105%. The measured results were consistent with the national standard method. FQCA has been used for determining nitrite in foods and nature waters. The capillary in FQCA was used as the container for CA/EDA-CDs/NO2- reaction and NO2- determination, and realized trace-level analysis for micro-volume samples (< 10 mu L/time).

AB Fruit metabolites are regulated by different phytohormones; however, this needs to be investigated. Dynamic metabolite profiling, based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, has been conducted on the fruit of tomato cultivar Micro-Tom and its five hormone mutants: dpy, not, dgt, epi and pro. In total, 48 metabolites were quantified, including sugars, organic acids and amino acids. The results demonstrated that ABA had a greater effect on the regulation of primary metabolism in tomato fruit, while ethylene can play an important role in the transition of primary to secondary metabolism. Besides, results from enzyme activities and transcript abundance involved in primary metabolism suggested that AIV and IIXK4 could play key roles in the accumulation of the main sugars. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of the link between hormone and metabolite change during fruit development in a collection of mutants with diverse hormone pathways.

AB Perchlorate causes great health concerns for its inhibition on the iodide intake of human. However, the contamination pattern of perchlorate in tea remains unclear although tea is substantially consumed worldwide. Thus, the present study established an efficient method using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) in combination with external standard method, and further lucubrated the contamination level of perchlorate in made tea, fresh tea leaves, along with the waters and soils from tea gardens. Fresh tea leaves with higher maturity generally contains more perchlorate. The observation explains well why the residual of perchlorate in dark tea is generally higher than that in black tea or green tea from the perspective of raw material. In consideration of the ubiquitous existence of perchlorate in waters and soils from tea gardens, perchlorate might accumulate in tea leaves via soil. This study not only provides an alternative quantification method of perchlorate when the isotope internal standard is out of stock, but also illuminates the contamination pattern of perchlorate in tea from planting process.

AB The aim of this study was developing a non-destructive method for the determination of color in paprika powder as well as for detecting possible adulteration with Sudan I. Non-destructive Raman spectroscopy was applied directly to paprika powder employing a laser excitation of 785 nm for the first time. The fluorescence background was estimated, by fitting a polynomial to each spectrum, and then subtracted. After preprocessing the spectra, some peaks were clearly identified as characteristic from pigments present in paprika. The preprocessed Raman spectra were correlated with the ASTA color values of paprika by partial least squares regression (PLSR). Twenty-five paprika samples were adulterated with Sudan I at different levels and the PLSR model was also obtained. The coefficients of determination (R-2) were 0.945 and 0.982 for ASTA and Sudan I concentration, respectively, and the root mean square errors of prediction (RMSEP) were 8.8 ASTA values and 0.91 mg/g, respectively. Finally, different approaches were applied to discriminate between adulterated and non-adulterated samples. Best results were obtained for partial least squares - discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), allowing a good discrimination when the adulteration with Sudan I was higher than 0.5%.

AB The relationship between microscopic and macroscopic properties in fat-continuous dispersions is multifaceted compared to bulk oils, which limits the ability to extrapolate results from bulk systems towards complex formulations. The impact of confectioner's sugar on the crystallization and rheology of palm oil (PO) and midfraction blend (PMF) was investigated in this study. Adding sugar significantly increased storage modulus (G') and firmness (F) of the oils while exhibiting increased sensitivity towards processing conditions. Multiple regression analysis was used to create predictive models that correct for the effects caused by confectioner's sugar, such as altered fat crystal morphology and increased network rigidity, through the binary variable.. With limited studies on the use of PO in confectionery applications, these models may be used by industry as tools for production that do not rely on anecdote and overcome any shortcomings associated with the extrapolation from bulk systems.

AB The bioaccessibility of phenolics and antioxidant activity were determined in acai, cupuacu, blackberry, blueberry, jabuticaba, raspberry, caja and soursop frozen pulps (FPs) using a digestion model coupled with a simulated intestinal barrier. Cyanidin 3-glucoside (6.56%) and pelargonidin 3-glucoside (28.33%) were bioaccessible in blueberry and raspberry. Catechin had the highest bioaccessibility in blueberry (270.71%), blackberry (137.51%), and jabuticaba (99.52%), while the highest bioaccessibility of epicatechin (153.59%) and syringic acid (147.14%) was observed in blueberry. Procyanidin B1 presented the highest bioaccessibility in caja (102.79%) and blackberry (87.62%) and contributed to the high DPPH center dot scavenging activity observed in these FPs. The bioaccessible fraction in soursop consisted of caffeic (8.18%), p-coumaric (7.36%), caftaric (7.96%) and chlorogenic (11.08%) acids, and these acids were correlated with the iron reduction capacity of this FP. Our study assessed the bioaccessible phenolics in several FPs and showed that those found in caja and blackberry possesses the highest antioxidant activity.

AB Magnetic textile solid phase extraction, based on the use of magnetically modified non-woven textile impregnated with chitosan, was successfully employed for the preconcentration of acid food dyes from water solutions. The photos of textile squares with the adsorbed dye were taken with a mobile phone. The image analysis of the photos was performed using appropriate freeware. The values of saturation, obtained through the HSB color space, were proportional to the dye concentration in the analyzed samples. Described inexpensive, simple and elution free assay enables analysis of dyes concentration in various solutions. This novel method has a potential to be a useful alternative to existing semiquantitative determination procedures, especially for dyes analysis.

AB There is an increasing demand for healthier foodstuff containing specific compounds such as Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs). In the case of PUFAs, protection against oxidative degradation is challengeable and microencapsulation emerges as an alternative. Mayonnaises containing microencapsulated oils could be a source of PUFAs. The objective was to formulate mayonnaises containing microencapsulated chia seeds oil, pumpkin seeds oil or baru oil. Micrometric particles with high encapsulation efficiency were produced and thermal analyses indicated an increased thermal stability of all oils after encapsulation. Rheology studies highlighted an increase in the mayonnaise viscosity when microparticles containing chia and pumpkin seeds oil were added. Mechanical texture was not affected by the presence of microparticles in the mayonnaise in all formulations tested. Nevertheless, samples containing microcapsules up to 5%wt were not distinguished from the base-mayonnaise in the sensorial test. Overall, enriched mayonnaises were successfully produced and encapsulation was efficient in protecting oils from oxidation.

AB Malolactic fermentation (MLF) is a natural and biological deacidification of wines and a required step for making premium red wines. MLF is carried out by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that are present in the fermenting wines. Currently, real-time control of MLF is an issue of great interest as the classical plate count technique for assessing bacterial populations requires long incubation times that are not compatible with a tight control of MLF. The aim of this study was to apply fluorescence microscopy and the bacteria staining kit Live/Dead BacLight (TM) to quantify viable LAB populations in red wines undergoing MLF. This method proved to be a fast and reliable culture-independent method to monitor wine MLF. Moreover, comparison of bacterial population data obtained by fluorescence microscopy and classical plate counts of LAB populations allowed discriminating a population of fully active and culturable cells, from total viable cells that include cells in an intermediate unculturable state.

AB Effect of pH-shifting on structural and functional properties of whey protein isolate and its interaction with (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate were investigated. Circular dichroism spectra showed that pH-shifting induced the decrease in alpha-helix content by 12.18% and alpha-sheet content by 3.24%, but beta-turn and random coil content increased by 4.26% and 5.91%, respectively. Increase of fluorescence intensity and red-shift of maximum emission wavelength indicated the structural unfolding and exposure of tyrosine. The treatment also significantly increased the surface hydrophobicity, disulfide bonds content, solubility, emulsifying activity and emulsion stability of whey protein isolate at P < 0.05 level. Fluorescence quenching analysis revealed that treated whey protein isolate have a stronger binding affinity to (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, resulting a better protection against the degradation of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate and its antioxidant activity. This study confirmed that pH-shifting treatment can improve functional properties of whey protein isolate and its potential as a protective carrier for polyphones.

AB Polymethylmethacrylate matrix has been developed as an analytical device for visual and spectrophotometric determination of malachite green. Based on the studied effects of different pH levels, temperature, contact time and diverse ions, optimum analysis conditions have been established. For malachite green, the calibration graph was linear in the range of 0.5-30 mg.L-1 in the samples with the detection limit of 1 mg.kg(-1). The proposed simple method makes it possible to determine malachite green visually in the concentration range 8-30 mg.L-1 using a colour scale. The method has been implemented for determination of malachite green in various sea fish samples.

AB Bisphenol A (BPA) is widely recognized being an endocrine disrupter and it is employed in many food packaging applications. Although it is not intended to take part in the manufacture of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) food grade, the presence of BPA in recycled PET should not be neglected. To satisfy the increasing need to ensure "BPA-free" articles, a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed. The crucial step in the sample preparation was the total dissolution/reprecipitation of the polymer. The repeatability of the method (RSD%, n = 6) was lower than 7.6%, while HorRat values ranged between 0.3 and 0.5. Limits of detection and quantitation were 1.0 and 3.3 ng g(-1), respectively. Recovery ranged from 89 to 107%. The method was applied to 23 samples of virgin and recycled pellets, preforms and bottles. Migration tests were also carried out. Results shown significantly higher levels of BPA in recycled PET.

AB New coated carbon fibers (CCFs) have been synthesized, characterized and used as solid phase microextraction (SPME) matrix for the analysis of phytohormones (jasmonic acid, indole-3-acetic acid, and abscisic acid) in wheat samples. The SPME device, realized inserting CCFs in a pencil-type device, when coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, provides in few steps high recovery values (79-112%), fast on-fiber derivatization (30 s), good method reproducibility (RSD < 20%), low detection limits (0.5-2.1 ng g(-1)). The penciltype CCFs-SPME device was successfully employed for the determination of phytohormone in wheat samples, allowing simple and quick extraction/derivatization/injection processes. The proposed device can be then considered as a promising and functional tool for fast and reliable extraction and preconcentration of analytes from real samples, allowing a simple derivatization procedure and direct injection in the chromatographic instrumentation.

AB Antioxidant casein hydrolysates were produced from buffalo casein (CB) and bovine casein (CN) using alcalase, trypsin, pepsin, or papain. The highest degree of hydrolysis (molecular weights < 3.5 kDa) were observed in CN (87.28%) and CB (83.90%) using alcalase, and the next highest was using trypsin (65.84% and 63.42%, respectively). In comparison with bovine casein hydrolysates (CNH), buffalo casein hydrolysates (CBH) contained more hydrophobic amino acids when pepsin was used, followed by trypsin, alcalase and papain. Hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity, superoxide scavenging activity, oxygen radical absorbance capacity and Fe3+ reducing power for alcalase-CBH and trypsin-CNH were 81.16% and 84.55%, 66.84% and 70.30%, 2.45 and 2.23 mM BHA, and 140.73 and 136.59 mu M Fe2+/mg protein, respectively. With the exception of papain hydrolysates, all hydrolysates (1 mg protein) exhibited protection against plasmid DNA nicking. Thus, alcalase-CBH and trypsin-CNH could offer beneficial antioxidant properties in functional foods and pharmaceuticals.

AB Non-crystalline granular starch (NCGS) is of considerable interest because of its unique functional properties. In this study, controlled gelatinization combined with sedimentation was used to prepare the NCGS from normal maize starch. The morphology and crystalline state of the NCGS were investigated using optical and electron microscopy, calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). These methods showed that starch granules maintained a granule structure up to around 80 degrees C but they completely dissociated at higher temperatures. The number of the granules that disappeared the birefringence gradually increased with the temperature increase, and completely disappeared at 75 degrees C. The DSC results indicated that the crystalline structure of amylopectin was totally destroyed when the treating temperature was greater than or equal to 75 degrees C. The XRD patterns showed that the crystalline structure of native starch was thoroughly disappeared at 75 degrees C. However, B-type and V-type crystals formed in the samples heated at 80 degrees C or higher, corresponding to the short-term retrogradation of amylose and the formation of amylose-lipids complexes, respectively.

AB The effect of heat moisture treatment (HMT), annealing (ANN), and dual retrogradation (DR) on functional and pasting properties, digestibility of starch components of banana flour comprising rapidly digestible starch (RDS), slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS) has been investigated, using native banana flour (NBF) as a control. Crystal type, relative crystallinity and morphological changes were characterised by XRD and SEM. HMT has markedly modified the pasting properties and resulted in the highest SDS content. HMT and ANN increased the relative crystallinity but DR decreased it. HMT and DR altered XRD patterns from B to A and A + B type respectively, while ANN did not change the XRD patterns. The NBF compact granule surface remained unchanged with ANN but changed to a more porous surface with HMT and DR, thereby increasing the digestibility. Crystal type and granule morphology affected the digestibility while relative crystallinity might change the pasting point.

AB The effects of high pressure treatments (200, 400, 600 MPa for 5 min) and a thermal treatment (85 degrees C for 5 min) were evaluated on cubes of two pumpkin species (Cucurbita maxima L. var. Delica and Cucurbita moschata Duchesne var. Butternut) up to 2 months of refrigerated storage. Increasing the pressure, small parenchyma cells from the pumpkin tissue exhibited collapses and separations, especially for Butternut. This species showed a lower hardness than Delica at time 0. For both species, 400 MPa and thermal treatment were the most effective in the inactivation of pectinmethylesterase, which reactivated after 2 months, especially for Butternut. Colorimetric parameters decreased after all treatments. Antioxidant activity resulted affected by pressure, showing a significant increase during storage especially for the samples treated at 200 MPa after 2 months, comparable to the thermal treated ones. Among the tested treatments, 400 MPa may be considered as the best option for the quality retention during storage.

AB A QuEChERS technique employing multi-walled carbon nanotubes was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantitation of boscalid and pyraclostrobin in grape field samples using rapid resolution liquid chromatography triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. The validated method was successfully applied to determine the levels of residual boscalid and pyraclostrobin in soil and grapes. The dissipation behavior of each fungicide followed first-order kinetics, with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.995-0.998 at 95% confidence. The highest levels of boscalid and pyraclostrobin in grape, with a pre-harvest interval of 14 days and doses of 380-570 mg a.i. kg(-1) in three or four applications, were 3.99 mg kg(-1) and 0.792 mg kg(-1), respectively. These are below the maximum residue limits for boscalid and pyraclostrobin in grape, as recommended by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture. Risk quotients (RQs) of these pesticides were evaluated by comparing national estimated daily intake with acceptable daily intake. The results yielded RQs for boscalid and pyraclostrobin in grape of 54% and 31.7%, respectively, which suggest a low health risk to consumers.

AB Heating milk fat leads to lactone formation. Hydroxy fatty acids, esterified in triacylglycerol (TAG), are likely precursors of lactones in milk fat, but respective hydroxy TAG isomers have not been directly detected for several decades. In this study, we separated hydroxy TAG isomers-1,2-dipalmitoyl-3-(5-hydroxy decanoyl)-rac-glycerol (PP(C10-5OH)-TAG), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-3-(5-hydroxy dodecanoyl)-rac-glycerol (PP(C12-5OH)-TAG), 1,2-dipalmitoyl- 3-(5-hydroxy tetradecanoyl)-rac-glycerol (PP(C14-5OH)-TAG), and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-3-(4-hydroxy dodecanoyl)- rac-glycerol-by using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESIMS/ MS) with an octacocyl silylation column. This method revealed the presence of PP(C10-5OH)-TAG, PP(C125OH)- TAG, and PP(C14-5OH)-TAG in butter oil, whereas no hydroxy TAG isomers were detected in heat-treated butter oil. Furthermore, a heating test of hydroxy TAG standards showed a decrease in hydroxy TAG levels and an increase in the corresponding lactone levels. These changes were stimulated by adding a small amount of water. This is the first reported analysis of respective hydroxy TAG isomers in milk fat using LC-ESI-MS/MS.

AB The low expression level of acidic lipases from Aspergillus sp. remains a major obstacle for their use in industrial applications. In this study, fusion expression with three fusion partners was investigated to enhance the expression level of an acidic lipase from A. niger (ANL) in Pichia pastoris. When fused with a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO), designated SANL, the highest activity reached 960 +/- 40 U/mL in a 3 L fermenter, which was 1.85-fold higher than that of the parent ANL. SANL exhibited its maximum activity at pH 2.5 and had lower K-m and higher k(cat)/K-m values than those of ANL. In gastrointestinal digestion experiments, SANL was resistant to pepsin and had high hydrolytic activity against triolein from pH 3.0 to 6.0. However, SANL was significantly inhibited by NaTDC above its CMC, which may limit its application for intestinal digestion, but allow it to remain suitable for gastric digestion.

AB Ferric and ferrous were used to prepare the magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), and concanavalin A was bound onto the MNPs as a magnetic nano-adsorbent for lactoferrin (Lf) separation. Scanning electron microscope showed that the diameter of modified MNPs was about 15.27 +/- 1.42 nm. The results showed that the optimum adsorption and elution conditions of modified MNPs on recovery Lf were 4 min and 5 min, respectively. The specificity of modified MNPs on recovery Lf was high, and the purity of Lf in eluent was 93.06%. The recovery rate of modified MNPs from whey and elution were more than 99.99%, and the recovery rate of Lf from whey performed a dose-dependent relationship. The maximum adsorption capacity of modified MNPs on recovery Lf was 90 mu g/mg. The adsorption capacity of modified MNPs stored in phosphate buffer at 4 degrees C significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those stored in other experimental conditions.

AB In this paper, the effects of pectin (PE) with different concentrations on the pasting, rheological and digestibility properties of corn starch (CS) were evaluated. The Rapid Visco-Analyzer results showed that the peak viscosity was decreased with the concentrations of PE (0.5% and 1.0%) and then increased when the concentration of PE exceeded 2.0%. PE resulted in lower breakdown and setback values of CS. Rheological results revealed that the CS and CS-PE mixtures exhibited a pseudoplastic and shear-thinning behavior. The storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G.) of CS were increased with increasing PE concentrations from 2.0% to 10.0%. PE resulted in a decrease in the starch susceptibility to a-amylase and promoted a remarkable reduction (P < 0.05) in the fraction of rapidly digested starch. The hydrolysis kinetic analysis suggested a decelerating effect of pectin on the hydrolysis rate of CS with lower values of equilibrium hydrolysis percentage (C8) and kinetic constant (k).

AB The effects of postharvest trisodium phosphate (TSP) dipping (0.5 mg/mL) on the quality and mitochondrial energy metabolism of apple fruit (cv. Golden delicious) were studied. The results indicated that TSP treatment inhibited the respiration intensity, delayed the increase of weight loss, and inhibited the decrease of flesh firmness, ascorbic acid (AsA), titratable acid (TA) and soluble solids content (SSC) of apple fruit. The results also indicated that TSP treatment delayed the decline of the content of ATP, ADP and energy charge of apple fruit, and enhanced the activity of H+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome C oxidase. These results suggested that TSP could maintain the quality of apple fruit by mediating respiration and mitochondrial energy metabolism.

AB The present study aims to evaluate the physicochemical, rheological, and safety properties of starches isolated from maize kernels with different types of defects. Starch isolation showed to be a valuable alternative to defective yellow maize kernels, since the presence of the evaluated kernel defects (broken, fermented, rotten, moldy, germinated, insect-damaged, and shrunken and immature kernels) did not provide significant changes on starch purity and colour. Only starch isolated from shrunken and immature kernels exhibited reduced extractability. Starch obtained from germinated kernels exhibited the greatest solubility. While flour from moldy kernels showed 7.5 ppb of aflatoxin A1, 25.0 ppb of aflatoxin A2, and 1229.4 ppb of fumonisin B1, any of these mycotoxins were detected in isolated starch. In sum, minor changes in pasting, thermal, crystallinity, and morphological properties of the isolated starches from defective kernels were determined, which does not impair its use in industrial processes.

AB Steviol glycosides (SGs)-enriched mother liquor sugar (MLS) used to be considered as a by-product of industrial stevia production. This work developed an efficient purification strategy to remove impurities from MLS. A nonpolar macroporous adsorption resin (MAR) NDR-1 was selected as the adsorbent and ethanol solution was used as the mobile phase. The adsorption ratio of SGs and impurities was highly affected by ethanol concentration (v/v) due to the polarity difference and competition. In particular, in 25% (v/v) ethanol solution, SGs were mostly adsorbed on NDR-1 while impurities were completely dissolved in ethanol solution. After static adsorption in 25% ethanol solution and desorption in pure ethanol, the impurity content of MLS was decreased from 34.15% to 12.88%, with a high adsorption ratio of 92.24%. At the same condition, dynamic adsorption presented a better purification result with low impurity content of 4.78% and high SGs recovery rate of 89.88%.

AB Although enzymatic browning is important for the beneficial coloration of some foods, it also causes negative effects on safety, quality, and nutritional values of fruit and vegetable. Thus, anti-browning natural compounds have gained attention in the food industry. Xanthone-related compounds have been well-known for its biological activities, but their roles in enzymatic browning are unclear. We screened xanthone-related natural compounds for their anti-polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity and maclurin was selected for further experiments due to stronger PPO-inhibitory activity. Maclurin suppressed enzymatic browning in potato supernatant for long-term partly through direct binding to and inactivating PPO presumably by forming multiple hydrogen bonds and aromatic interactions with the binding pocket. In addition, maclurin elevated antioxidant capacity when added to potato supernatant. Considering the diverse health-promoting effects of antioxidants, maclurin can be applied as a functional food additive to block enzymatic browning and increase the antioxidant property of foods including beverages and soups.

AB Effects of the combination of repeated heat-moisture treatment for two times (2-HMT) and compound enzymes hydrolysis on structural and physicochemical properties of porous wheat starches were investigated. The dual-modification resulted in the formation of more pores on the surface of native starches, as revealed by SEM. Compared with single-modified starch samples, the porous starch samples treated by dual-modification exhibited higher gelatinization temperature, lower gelatinization enthalpy and higher crystallinity, as determined by DSC, FT-IR and XRD. Batch adsorption experiments manifested that the dual-modified starch samples exhibited higher adsorption capacities for water, oil and methylene blue. Moreover, the adsorption behaviors of the porous A-type starch granules with or without 2-HMT fitted Freundlich isotherm model well. Low-temperature nitrogen adsorption results showed that dual modifications greatly increased specific surface area and total pore volume of the starch samples. The present study suggests that the dual-modification is an attractive alternative for preparing porous wheat starches.

AB Tanshinones and phenolic acids are two important metabolites synthesized by the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Salvia miltiorrhiza. There is increasing market demand for these compounds. Here, we isolated and functionally characterized SmERF1L1, a novel JA (Jasmonic acid)-responsive gene encoding AP2/ERF transcription factor, from Salvia miltiorrhiza. SmERF1L1 was responsive to methyl jasmonate (MJ), yeast extraction (YE), salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene treatments. Subcellular localization assay indicated that SmERF1L1 located in the nucleus. Overexpression of SmERF1L1 significantly increased tanshinones production in transgenic S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots by comprehensively upregulating tanshinone biosynthetic pathway genes, especially SmDXR. Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that SmERF1L1 binds to the GCC-box of SmDXR promoter while dual luciferase (Dual-LUC) assay showed that SmERF1L1 positively regulated the expression of SmDXR. Our study suggested that the SmERF1L1 may be a good potential target for further metabolic engineering of bioactive component biosynthesis in S. miltiorrhiza.

AB Ice cider is a special product made from apple juices enriched by freezing. In this paper, the method of obtaining the ice juices (cryo-extraction and exhaustion) and the year of harvest have been evaluated. For this purpose, a controlled raw apple mixture and an autochthonous Saccharomyces bayanus strain were used throughout the study. Both the enrichment system and the year of harvest significantly influenced the levels of total phenols, sucrose, malic acid, ethyl acetate and 2-phenylethanol. The ciders made by cryo-extraction presented the higher sugar/acidity and sugar/polyphenol ratios. These ciders were more fruity, less astringent and scored better for quality than those obtained by exhaustion. Additionally, a preliminary assay of juice enrichment by cryo-concentration is described. The corresponding ciders presented higher methanol and lower 2-phenylethanol contents than those obtained by the cryo-extraction and exhaustion methods.

AB Utilization of phenolic compounds in rice husk and bran is important for improving the functionality of rice by-products. Eight rice varieties planted in different area were selected to analyze the phenolic compounds distribution of fractions in Japonica and Indica rice by using UPLC-MS method. A total of 12 phenolic compounds were identified in all rice varieties. Ferulic acid, gallic acid, protocatechuic acid and syringic acid were the dominant phenolic compounds in rice bran, while p-Hydroxybenzaldehyde was the main phenolic compounds existed in rice husk (14.46-23.72 mu g.g(-1)). Bran and husk fractions provide more than 90% of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity of whole rice. Regardless of the planting environmental effects, Japonica rice has significant higher phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity than Indica rice (P < 0.05). Therefore, it can be concluded that the distribution of phenolic compounds were strongly correlated with the rice varieties and fractions.

AB Quinoa flour has been receiving an increasing attention as a substitute for wheat flour in bread formulations due to immuno-nutritional features. This growing interest in quinoa has increased the demand and consequently the prices, being a target for possible adulterations with cheaper cereals. Fourier transform Mid-infrared spectroscopy (FT-MIR) was used in the present work as a fingerprinting technique to detect the presence of three adulterants (soybean, maize and wheat flours). Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA) models were used to classify pure from adulterated samples. 414 samples were measured, including pure quinoa flour, pure adulterant flours and adulterated quinoa flours using three different proportions (10, 5 and 1% w/w). PLS-DA showed better classification results than SIMCA, with error rates from 2 to 8% for the three strategies used to detect the presence of adulterants.

AB This study investigated the conformational changes in proteins and oil molecules at fish oil/water interfaces. Results of FT-IR indicate that alpha-helical content of bovine serum albumin decreased (from 46.1% to 28.4%), and beta-sheet and random coil contents increased (from 15.5% and 13.5% to 18.9% and 28.1%, respectively) after protein adsorption at the fish oil/water interface. Fluorescence emission maximum of emulsions showed a blue shift compared to native proteins. FT-IR spectra of oil molecules showed broadenings in CH stretching vibration peaks of CH3 and CH2 groups of the fish oil. These results combined with structural information of BSA in the protein database led to the following hypothesis: binding occurs between proteins and lipid molecules in the oil-water interface. This study provides insight into the conformational changes of proteins and oil molecules in fish oil/water interfaces and broadens the fundamental understanding of the possible stability mechanisms of emulsions stabilized by proteins.

AB This study aimed to determine the characteristics, metabolic pathways and cellular functions of S-nitrosylated proteins from pork postmortem muscle using bioinformatics analysis. The results showed that S-nitrosylated proteins had a broad range of molecular weight and pI value and were mainly located in the functional region of secondary structure. The motif revealed the lysine (K) positioned at -5, -7, +1 and +5 through the S-nitrosocysteine while "C-X-X-C" was identified as the motif for non-S-nitrosylation-modified cysteine. The proteins were widely localized in cell compartments and mostly belonged to enzymes participating in the metabolic process. Glycolysis was the most significant pathways of S-nitrosylated proteins in postmortem muscle. The cell death of muscle cells was predicted to be inhibited by S-nitrosylation with the potential influence on the apoptosis. Those identified pathways and cellular functions of S-nitrosylation are proposed to have a profound influence on meat quality and should be highly regarded.

AB Photodynamic treatment (PDT) is an innovative technology with non-thermal and environmentally sound merits, but the evaluation on the storage qualities of fresh produce was scarce. In this study, the effects of curcumin-based PDT on the quality of fresh-cut 'Fuji' apple slices during storage at 4 degrees C were investigated. The impacts on the survival of Escherichia coli, color and weight loss were examined under different curcumin concentrations, illumination time or incubation time. Curcumin-based photodynamic inactivation of E. coli on the surface of apple slices reached 0.95 log. Curcumin-based PDT was proven to prevent browning and weight loss. Additionally, PDT significantly reduced the activity of polyphenol oxidase and peroxidases to 48% and 51%, respectively. Moreover, there were few negative changes in total phenolic, ascorbic acid content and antioxidant activity of the treated apples. These results indicated that curcumin-based PDT was a viable and promising non-thermal technology to preserve the quality of fresh produce.

AB WThe objective of this study was to characterize a plant origin beta-glucosidase from black plum seeds and identify its conformational changes in twenty-six imidazolium-and amino acid-based ionic liquids (ILs). The results revealed that the purified 60 kDa enzyme was monomeric in nature, maximally active at 55 degrees C and pH 5.0, and nearly completely inhibited by Hg2+ and Ag+. Attractive peculiarities of the relative low kinetic and higher glucose inhibition constants (K-m = 0.58mM [pNPG]; K-i = 193.5 mM [glucose]) demonstrated its potential applications in food industry. Circular dichroism studies showed that the secondary structural changes of the enzyme depended not only on the anions, but also on the cations of the assayed ILs. Interestingly, no corresponding relations were observed between the changes in enzyme structure induced by ILs and its catalytic activities, suggesting that the influences of ILs on enzymatic processes don't rely simply on enzyme conformational changes.

AB This study reports a method for propoxycarbazone pesticide determination including its metabolite in food commodities (lettuce, beetroot, soybean meal and honey). Both compounds were extracted, and samples cleaned using a buffered QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) method based on the AOAC Official Method, followed by ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Both matrix-matched calibration curves showed good linearity (R-2 =0.99) within the tested ranges. Method performance was assessed on the basis of recovery and intra/inter-day precision studies at spiked concentrations of 10 (25) and 50 mu g/kg (n=5). Mean recovery rates were between 73 and 110%, while precision studies, assessed by relative standard deviation (RSD), were <= 20%. The limits of quantification (LOQ) were established as 10 or 25 mu g/kg, depending on the matrix, which are low enough for monitoring residues at regulated maximum residue levels.

AB Chlorine treatment increases the surface hydrophobicity of starch granules of soft wheat flour and reduces its gluten network forming capacity and apparent content of the flour lipids, the latter presumably by forming chlorinated derivatives. It also increases its solvent holding capacity as shown by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) experiments in presence of sucrose. The exchanging protons in the extra-granular space are present in an environment with restricted mobility, indicating strong interactions between chlorinated soft wheat flour (CSWF) components and solvent. Chlorination reduced the capability of free flour lipids to shield starch granules during rapid visco analysis (RVA). The higher viscosity reached in RVA with CSWF was attributed to not only its lipids having different properties but also its protein, resulting in improved starch swelling and amylose leaching. Finally, H-1 NMR indicated that starch and protein networks in CSWF-sucrose gels were better structured than in gels prepared from non-chlorinated flour.

AB The effects of different processing methods were investigated, including on the fluidity, solubility, nutrient composition, digestibility, color and aroma constituent of instant brown rice powder. It showed that, except for flavonoids, different processing methods significantly influenced the indexes of the instant brown rice flour (p < 0.05). Germination could deteriorate the fluidity and solubility of brown rice powder and reduce the digestibility of protein, and starch. Exogenous enzyme treatment improved the fluidity and solubility of the brown rice powder as well as the digestion rate of protein and starch. The synergistic treatment of germination and exogenous enzymes significantly increased the digestibility of starch, but it deteriorated the fluidity, the rate of agglomeration and dispersion time. Comparing with DGBRE, DBRE produced a better quality instant brown rice powder.

Following extraction, PVPP was used to precipitate polyphenols, supernatant was diluted to minimize matrix effects. Homogenized samples were vortexed in acetonitrile prior to cleanup with a combination of PVPP (150 mg), PSA (50 mg) and GCB (10 mg). Supernatant (1 mL) was filtered and diluted 10-fold before analysis. In 4 agricultural products that usually produce high interference, the matrix effects were overcome for all pesticides expect in green and oolong tea for acephate, omethoate, dinotefuran and nitenpyram. Mean recoveries ranged from 73% to 106%, and RSD <= 13%. Limits of quantification ranged from 0.01 to 0.02 mg kg(-1). PVPP as one of excellent QuEChERS material combined with dilution was verified as a promising method for multiple pesticide residues analysis in complex matrices.

AB Purple sweet potato anthocyanins are common natural pigments widely used in food industry, while they are often thermally processed in application. Degradation of anthocyanins, formation of polymers and color changes of purple sweet potato extract (PSPE) were investigated at 90 degrees C in the range of pH 3.0-pH 7.0. Data analysis indicated a first-order reaction for anthocyanins degradation in solutions with pH 3.0, 5.0 and 7.0 have half-lives of 10.27, 12.42 and 4.66 h, respectively. The polymeric color formation followed zero-order kinetics, progressively increasing with pH values. The color of PSPE were changed with heating time and pH value through visual observation and colorimetric characterization. Analysis by UV-Vis spectrophotometry and HPLC indicated that anthocyanins in solution with pH 3.0 changed from monomeric anthocyanin into new polymers during heat treatment. Degradation of anthocyanins was accompanied by an increase in polymeric color index, due to the formation of melanoidin pigments and condensation reactions.

AB A robust and sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed for the analysis of seven mycotoxins in fruits and vegetables. The variations of seven mycotoxins concentrations during storage were also determined for the first time. Solid phase extraction (SPE) and QuEChERS clean-up were compared, and extraction was finally performed with acetonitrile under acidic conditions followed by HLB SPE purification. Seven mycotoxins were separated on a C18 column by gradient elution, scanned by ESI+ and ESI- dynamic switching and detected with MRM mode. LOD and LOQ, matrix effect, accuracy and precision of the developed method were investigated. Results were linear in their concentration ranges for all mycotoxins with R-2 being greater than 0.999. LODs and LOQs were ranged from 0.05 to 3.0 mu g/kg and 0.2 to 10.0 mu g/kg, respectively. Average recoveries were between 81.1% and 116% with intraday-and interday-precision being in the ranges of 3.0-6.2% and 4.2-6.1%, respectively. The validated method provides sufficient selectivity, sensitivity and accuracy to screen for seven mycotoxins at trace levels, without using standard addition or matrix-matched calibration to compensate for matrix effects. The method was successfully applied for mycotoxins analysis in fruits and vegetables. None were detected in fresh samples, but AOH and AME were detected in strawberry, and TeA was detected in tomato fruits during long-term storage. Their concentrations were in the range of 3.6-165.3 mu g/kg from 3 days to 60 days and significantly increased along with storage time.

AB The present research studied the thermal pre-treatment of non-soaked and soaked black seed (BS) by microwave radiation (1-3.5 min) in comparison with conventional roasting (2-8 min, 180 degrees C). As BS was treated for a longer time, a significant increase (p < 0.05) was observed in total chlorophylls, carotenoids and phenolic contents in the extracted oils. The oils obtained from the soaked seeds (to 8%) had significantly higher oil quality properties. The optimum extraction conditions were: irradiation time of 3.5 min and BS moisture content of 8%, which resulted in an extraction yield of 35.76%, 10643.730 caffeic acid equivalents/100 g, PV of 9.63 meq O-2/kg and 18.88 h of Rancimat oxidative stability. The microwave pre-treatment was more effective than conventional roasting in reducing lipase activity. Based on the results obtained, it was advisable to treat BS with microwaves and soak them before extracting the oil in a cold press at room temperature.

AB An aminated Amberlite XAD-resin as a solid phase extractant was tested for speciation of inorganic mercury, Hg (II) and methylmercury, MeHg(I) in water and fish tissue samples. It was found that Hg(II) and MeHg(I) ions could be simultaneously retained by a column filled with AAXAD-4 resin at pH 4 and the sequential quantitative elutions of Hg(II) and MeHg(I) were achieved using 10 mL of 0.1%(m/v) thiourea in 3%(v/v) HCl and 10 mL of 6 mol L-1 HCl, respectively. Hg(II) in the eluent was directly determined and MeHg(I) in the second eluent is quantified using FI-CVG-AAS after its oxidative digestion with KMnO4. The limits of detection for Hg(II) and MeHg(I) ions were found to be 0.148 and 0.157 mu g L-1, respectively. The method was validated by analysing a certified reference material. The relative errors for Hg(II), MeHg(I) and T-Hg were in range of -1.8% and -3.2%.

AB A novel acidic polysaccharide fraction (PZMP2-2) was isolated from Ziziphus Jujuba cv. Muzao fruit via hot water extraction and purified by DEAE-Sepharose FF and Sephacryl S-300 column chromatography. PZMP2-2 consisted of rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, galactose, and galacturonic acid in a ratio of 1.18: 5.23: 0.22: 2.68: 2.20, with a molecular weight of 62.73 kDa. Structural features of PZMP2-2 were investigated using FT-IR, SEM, AFM, GC-MS analysis and NMR spectroscopy. Methylation and GC-MS analysis revealed that the main glycosidic bonds in PZMP2-2 comprised 1-linked Galp, 1,3-linked Araf, 1,2,4-linked Rhap, 1,3-linked Galp, 1,4-linked GalpA and 1,3,5-linked Araf. NMR analysis indicate that PZMP 2-2 has a linear backbone of (1 -> 4)-linked GlcpA and (1 -> 2,4)-linked Rhap residues, with branches at the O-4 position, consisting of Araf and Galp residues.

AB Lycopene bioaccessibility is enhanced by processing, as explained by the destructuration of plant tissues, making diffusion easier. However, in tomato, the relationship between grinding intensity and lycopene release from purees suffers from uncertainty. In particular, hot break puree exhibited twice as much diffusible lycopene as compared to cold break, while both were processed with the same grinding intensity. To explain the difference, we systematically studied the diffusivity of particles according to their size and integrity, and used microscopic and physical analyses to reveal structural differences. Neither particle size distribution, nor cell destruction, nor plastid transformation exhibited any correlation to the differences in diffusivity. However, Raman micro-spectroscopy combined with a chemometric analysis revealed significant changes in lycopene spectra and a putative linkage to phospholipid transformation. Phospholipid profiling of five pairs of contrasted purees revealed that, during the cold break, a transition from complex phospholipids to more simple phosphatidic acid molecules systematically occurred.

AB Alkaline protease was purified from Bacillus sp. ZJ1502 isolated from fermented bean curd and its enzymatic properties were investigated. The final purification fold and specific activity were 18.6 and 30,230 U/mg, respectively. The molecular weight was 14 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The optimal pH and temperature were 10.0 and 40 degrees C, respectively. Alkaline protease showed high stability at pH 9-11. Mn2+ and Tween-80 improved its activity by 22% and 31%, respectively, while SDS, CMC and EDTA respectively inhibited its activity by 33%, 47% and 22%. Alkaline protease exhibited poor tolerance to n-butyl alcohol and ethanol, but showed resistance to H2O2. 29.8% of the original activity was still retained after 0.5M H2O2 treatment for 3 min. The K-m and V-max values of this enzyme towards casein were 16.7 mg/ml and 14.7 mu g/(min.ml), respectively. This study provides a basis for understanding enzymatic properties of Bacillus sp. ZJ1502 alkaline protease.

AB A single out-line HPLC-GC (FID) analytical method is applied to acquire the chromatographic fingerprint characteristic of the TMS-4,4'-desmetylsterol derivative fraction of several marketed edible vegetable oils in order to identify and discriminate the most valuable extra-virgin olive oils from the other vegetal oils (canola, corn, grape seed, linseed, olive pomace, peanut, rapeseed, soybean, sesame, seeds (non-specified composition but usually a blend of corn and sunflower) and sunflower). The natural structure of the preprocessed data undergoes a preliminary exploration using principal component analysis and heat map-based cluster analysis. A partial least squares-discriminant model is first trained from 53 oil samples (only 3 latent variables) and externally validated from 18 test oil samples. No classification errors are found and all the test samples are correctly classified. Additional classification models are also built in order to discriminate among vegetables-oil families and excellent results have been also achieved.

AB Two fish parvalbumin models were established to study relationships among matrix effect, extractability, and thermostability during in vitro immunodetection using two parvalbumin-specific monoclonal antibodies (3E1 and PARV19). Our results illustrated that matrix-induced thermal instability of parvalbumin was due mainly to physical (hydrophobic effect) and chemical (thiol-disulfide interchange) interactions. The addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, surfactant), beta-mercaptoethanol (reducing agent) or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, metal chelator) during sample preparation could not only increase the extractability of parvalbumin but also enhanced its immunodetection. Our findings demonstrated excess EDTA completely chelated Ca2+ in parvalbumin and rendered it undetectable using PARV19 (a Ca2+-dependent antibody). Overall, our resulted showed that matrix effect on in vitro analyte quantification cannot be underestimated. Any false negative or positive results could lead to severe or life-threatening allergic reactions.

AB This work was aimed to develop a novel phosphatidylserine (PS) production process for the food industry. The pld(sh) gene, encoding phospholipase D from Streptomyces halstedii (PLDsh) was cloned, and the codon optimized pldm(sh) gene was freely expressed by Pichia pastoris GS115 and successfully overexpressed on the cell surface of P. pastoris GS115 as displayed PLDMsh (dPLDM(sh)) - a whole-cell biocatalyst for PS synthesis from phosphatidylcholine and L-serine. dPLDMsh was stable over a broad range of temperatures (20-60 degrees C) and pH values (4.0-8.0), indicating significant improvement in stability compared with its free counterpart expressed by P. pastoris GS115. Under the optimum conditions, the conversion yield of PS was 53%, and the relative yield remained above 40% after 4 repeated batch cycles of dPLDMsh catalysis in an aqueous system. Thus, dPLDM(sh) and the associated reaction system provided a novel strategy for efficient PS production for the food industry.

AB Apiosidases are glycosidases relevant for aroma development during fermentation of wines and black tea. Reaction mechanism of apiosidase from Aspergillus aculeatus in commercial glycanase Viscozyme L was studied by H-1 NMR technique. Study of hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl beta-D-apiofuranoside revealed that this reaction proceeds with inversion of hydroxyl group in the anomeric center, which confirms inverting mechanism of the enzyme and its inability to catalyze transapiosylation in syntheses of apiosides.

AB The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of AAPH on the conformational structure and allergenicity of shrimp tropomyosin (TM). The structure of AAPH-TM was evaluated by SDS-PAGE, fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD) and ultraviolet light (UV), and the allergenicity was evaluated by in vivo and in vitro methods. Results showed that AAPH can induce structural changes through TM aggregations. These aggregations can decrease the IgG/IgE binding capacity on immunoblot analysis. Further competitive inhibition ELISA (ciELISA) results showed the IC50 of AAPH-TM (AAPH 0-25 mmol/l) changed from 0.086 to 46.2 mu g/ml, which correlated with TM structural changes. An RBL-2H3 cell assay showed that release rate of beta-hexosaminidase and histamine decreased by 51.6% and 68.1% with AAPH (5 mmol/l) treatment, respectively. A mouse model showed AAPH-TM could decrease levels of IgE/IgG1, release of histamine and mMCP-1 in sera. In conclusion, AAPH induced TM aggregation can cause structural changes and decrease the allergenicity.

AB Gas chromatography mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and next generation sequencing-based metagenomics were applied to investigate the effect of different microbial community starters (MCSs) on kimchi fermentation. Profiles of metabolites and microbial community in kimchi were remarkably different from those on the first day of fermentation according to MCS used. Kimchi inoculated with MCS5 or MCS10 had relatively higher levels of lactic acid, leucine, propanedioic acid, serine, glycerol, erythritol, and sorbitol but lower levels of butanedioic acid, glyceric acid, myo-inositol, xylose, fructose, and talose compared to control kimchi or kimchi inoculated with MCS1. Microbial communities of kimchi inoculated with MCS1, MCS5, and MCS10 were characterized by high ratios of Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus brevis, respectively. The microbial community of kimchi formed on the first day of fermentation was stable for 50 days, suggesting that microbial communities containing multiple microorganisms can be used as starters to obtain desired quality of kimchi.

AB Starch is a major determinant of the glycemic responses elicited by our diets, but the exact contribution of the two main amylolytic enzymes (salivary and pancreatic alpha-amylases) remains a matter of debate. Our aim was to investigate the contribution of the oral, gastric and intestinal phases to the hydrolysis of starch in bread and pasta during dynamic in vitro digestions using DiDGI (R). Before its inactivation by the low gastric pH, salivary alpha-amylase released about 80% of the starch in bread and 30% of that in pasta, hydrolysing over half of it into oligosaccharides. Accordingly, the contribution of pancreatic alpha-amylase during the intestinal phase was lower for bread than pasta. Our results are well correlated with in vivo data, and demonstrate the importance of salivary alpha-amylase during oro-gastric processing of starchy foods. This finding is discussed in relation with observations regarding salivary alpha-amylase from other fields of knowledge.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the chemical composition of precursor flavor substance of Wuding chicken with the age of 110, 140, 170, 200 and 230 days. The metabolic composition of chicken meat was studied using H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Compared with 110 days, the total metabolite content was significantly higher in other four periods for the chicken breast and leg meat (P < 0.01). Organic acid and small peptides were the two most metabolites for the chicken breast and leg meat. Comprehensive multivariate data analysis showed significant differences about precursor substance between the chicken samples of 230 days and other four ages including lactate, creatine, IMP, glucose, carnosine, anserine, taurine and glutamine (P < 0.05). These results contribute to a further understanding of changes in chicken meat metabolism as chicken ages, which could be used to help assess the quality of chicken meat.

Flours were obtained by mechanical methods (F1 to F4, > 840, 840 to 500, 500 to 149 and < 149 mu m, respectively). F1 and F2 contain 40% mesocarp while F3 and F4 show 80 and 90%, respectively. Mesocarp reserve parenchyma is rich in free and bound phenolic compounds, carbohydrates and fibers of the vascular system, CaCO3 crystals, and minerals (Fe, Ca, Mg, K). Apigenin C-glycosides and phenylpropanoids acids were identified in all fractions whereas F4 showed the highest level. All fractions showed functional properties. F3 and F4 showed the highest activity as H2O2 and HO center dot scavenger. F1 and F2 showed the highest activity as reductor agents and lipoperoxidation inhibitors. Flours with different granulometry may be suitable as functional ingredient or nutraceutical whereas flours with a smaller particle size (F3 and F4) are more interesting as functional ingredients because of their high content of bound phenolic compounds and particle homogeneity and could be used either alone or together.

AB The article reports on discrimination of dried sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (A. japonicus) products from different geographical regions in China (Xiapu, Jiaonan, Weihai, Yantai, Dalian). For this purpose, sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion mass spectra (SWATH-MS)-based proteomic analysis combined with chemometrics was evaluated. Proteome variations of A. japonicus samples determined by SWATH-MS using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer were mined by chemometric tools to clarify the correlation between protein quantitation data and geographical origin. A differentiating OPLS-DA model was constructed with 55 SWATH-MS quantified proteins. A. japonicus samples from five locations were clearly classified by the developed OPLS-DA model and 100% prediction accuracy was achieved in validation testing as well as real-life sample analysis. Seventeen proteins were identified as discriminatory biomarkers allowing geographical provenance. The proposed method might be applied in origin authentication of commercially dried A. japonicus products.

AB Maternal garlic intake during pregnancy and the breastfeeding period has been reported to be associated with the potential of modulating later garlic acceptance in infants. However, the metabolism of garlic constituents in humans and their elimination and potential excretion into human milk are not yet fully understood. In previous studies, we identified volatile garlic-derived metabolites in human milk as well as in human urine, namely allyl methyl sulfide, allyl methyl sulfoxide and allyl methyl sulfone. To monitor the excretion of these garlic metabolites in a larger cohort, we quantified these metabolites in a total of 18 human milk sets, whereby each set comprised of one sample collected before and three samples after garlic consumption. The analyses revealed that the concentrations of the metabolites were most abundant 1-3.5 h after garlic consumption, with distinct differences between test persons regarding metabolite concentrations as well as temporal excretion.

AB Blueberry anthocyanins extract (BAE) is widely used natural antioxidant. The inhibitory effect of BAE (175 mg/kg bw/day) pretreatment on glycidamide (GA) metabolism following acrylamide (AA) (35 mg/kg bw/day) gavage for consecutive 7 days and 14 days in SD rat model were investigated in this work. AA, GA and its metabolites in urine, blood and 3 tissues were quantified using UPLC-MS/MS, respectively. The results showed pretreatment with BAE could significantly block the epoxidation of AA to GA. Compared with the control, BAE pretreatment significantly decreased the amount of GA and its mercapturic acid metabolite N-acetyl-S-(3-amino-2-hydroxy-3-oxopropyl)-cysteine (GAMA3) in rats urine (p < 0.05), and sharply decreased the accumulation of GA DNA adduct N7-(2-carbamoyl-2-hydroxyethyl) guanine (N7-GA-Gua) in liver, kidney and lung (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, significant reduction (p < 0.05) of N-(2-carbamoyl-2-hydroxyethyl) valine (GA-VAL) content was found in erythrocyte of the rats treated with BAE. This study provides a novel evidence for elucidating the chemopreventive effect of BAE on AA toxicity.

AB Oil-in-water (o/w) nanoemulsion has great superiority over any other material in the delivery of active substances with low solubility. Whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) is a type of potential emulsifier used to fabricate o/w emulsion because of its rapid adsorption capacity. To further improve the stability of droplets stabilized by WPH, sodium caseinate (SC) and gum Arabic (GA) were combined with WPH to form a short-media-long chain covering layer, which resulted in spontaneously-ordered adsorption on the surface of the droplets. The results showed that the oil droplets were fine and stable, which could be attributed to the rapid adsorption of short chains and the adsorption of SC and GA in sequence. In addition, their stability was enhanced with an increase of the GA ratio, when the GA concentration was 2.0% wt, the emulsion always maintained homogeneity after 30 d of storage.

AB Concerning the particular nutritive value of honeydew honey compared to blossom honey, and small number of studies defining botanical origin of honeydew honey, comprehensive analysis of phenolic profile of 64 honeydew honey samples of specific botanical origin was performed. Two advanced techniques of liquid chromatography hyphenated with mass spectrometry were used for identification of a total of 52 compounds and quantification of 25 of them. Pattern recognition analysis applied on data on phenolic compounds content confirmed that quercetin, naringenin, caffeoylquinic acid, hydroxyphenylacetic acid, apigenin and genistein, could be considered as potential markers of botanical origin of honeydew honey. Spectroscopic and electrochemical approaches were applied for the evaluation of the antioxidant capacity. Quercus sps. samples, Quercus frainetto and Quercus ilex, showed high biological activity and specific chemical composition. Additionally, cyclic voltammetry profiles were used for characterization and natural clustering of honeydew honey for the first time.

AB A series of plant-derived bioactive compounds belonging to the class of polyphenols, terpenes and capsaicinoids, interact with important pathophysiological pathways at a molecular, cellular and systemic level. Mechanisms of action include altering cell growth and differentiation, apoptosis, autophagy, inflammation, redox balance and metabolic and energy homeostasis. These effects might also involve the expression and function of Aquaporins (AQPs), a family of membrane channel proteins, involved in several body functions. The ultimate translational beneficial effect of such phytocompounds on AQPs in health and disease is a matter of intensive research. Results might provide novel therapeutic approaches to a number of human diseases. Here, we give an updated overview of this fast growing and promising field, discussing a number of phytocompounds and their action on AQPs and related potential clinical achievements.

AB Polyunsaturated fatty acids are particularly sensitive to the damages due to reactive oxygen species and lipid oxidation has been reported to be involved in the degradation of food as well as in the early stages of several diseases. Our objective was to study the mechanisms of action of flax (Linum usitatissimum) phenolic compounds to prevent membrane lipid oxidation. To do so, several biophysical techniques (oxidative stress, surface tension, fluorescence spectroscopy and HPLC) were used to investigate the ability of the compounds to prevent lipid oxidation and to interact with membranes. We evidenced a relationship between the structure and the antioxidant efficiency as aglycone compounds were significantly more efficient (p < 0.05) than glucoside compounds. In addition, our results revealed that aglycone lignans spontaneously penetrated the membrane contrary to aglycone hydroxycinnamic acids. To conclude, the comparison of the antioxidant efficiencies revealed that membrane inserted compounds better inhibited lipid oxidation than non-inserted compounds.

AB Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been widely used in many fields of molecular diagnostics, including detection of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Herein, we report a collaborative ring trial validation of three established visual LAMP assays targeting three common GM elements, namely CaMV35S promoter, FMV35S promoter and NOS terminator, respectively. The high specificity of each assay was confirmed in different GM events analyses, and the sensitivity of each was determined to be 10, 10, and 50 haploid genome equivalents (HGEs) for CaMV35S promoter, FMV35S promoter, and NOS terminator, respectively. The probability of detection was also determined based on specificity and sensitivity data from 10 participating laboratories that returned correct results for the practical sample tests. These results demonstrate that the three visual LAMP assays are sensitive and time-saving, with high application potential for on-spot testing and routine screening of GMOs.

AB The role of native (NB) and extruded (EB) banana starch, and a 1:1 native: extruded banana starch composite (MB), in slowing down the starch digestibility of bread crumb and crust was investigated. During extrusion, the molecular weight of banana starch was reduced from 2.75x10(8) to 4.48x10(6) g/mol (HPSEC-MALS-RI). Results showed a slowly digestible starch (SDS) increase from 1.09% (control) to 4.2, 6.6, and 7.76% in NB, MB and EB crumbs (fully gelatinized), respectively. DSC data attributed this occurrence to the formation of supramolecular structures upon storage involving amylopectin branches (especially those from fragmented amylopectin in EB). The hedonic sensory test showed no differences in overall liking between MB, EB and control, validating feasibility of including banana in the formulation. For the first time, this study shows a molecular size reduction as a strategy to manufacture selected starches that result in highly gelatinized baked products rich in structurally driven SDS.

AB This study aimed to describe the effects of the cooking condition, including water ratio (WR) and soaking time (ST), on the texture of rolled barley, and to evaluate its beta-glucan content, total phenol content and in vitro starch digestibility. Rolled barley (75 g) was soaked in 1.5x, 2.0x and 2.5x weight of aliquots of Milli-Q water at room temperature, for 30 and 90 min, respectively, and then cooked using a rice cooker. Barley and rice were also pearled (polished), cooked and examined. The WR and ST did not affect the adhesiveness of rolled barley but were negatively related to its firmness. Rolled barley and barley had higher beta-glucan and polyphenol contents and less starch hydrolysis during in vitro digestion than rice. The starch granules in rolled barley are enclosed by thick cell walls, which may be responsible for its firmness and low starch digestibility.

AB Multicomponent simultaneous analysis is important for management programs, which are required in beer industries because the beer constituents measure by combining several methods in the present. In response to a requirement, our research group developed single sample injection ion chromatography systems, which comprise ion-exclusion/cation-exchange chromatography (IEC/CEC) and post-column derivatization and show promise for simultaneously determining concentrations of organic and inorganic species and alcohol commonly found in beer. Optimal chromatographic resolutions for determining 17 different species in beer samples by IEC/CEC were obtained on a H+-formed weakly acidic cation-exchange resin column with an eluent comprising 2 mM phthalic acid and 1 mM 18-crown-6. Consequently, the usefulness of developed method for monitoring beer samples was demonstrated in terms of beneficial information such as dependency of K+ concentration on the malt amount, influences of organic anion concentrations on different types of bottling methods, and validation of ethanol concentrations displayed in the ingredient table.

AB The suitability of post-packaging gamma radiation treatment for preserving total folates or vitamin B-9 in watercress (Nasturtium officinale R. Br.) and buckler sorrel (Rumex induratus Boiss. & Reut.) during storage at 4 degrees C was evaluated. Comparable amounts of total folates were found in fresh, non-stored samples of both species. In watercress, the irradiation treatment of up to 5 kGy reduced the loss of total folates caused by 7 days of storage. In turn, the 12-day storage period did not affect the total folate content of buckler sorrel (while the 2 kGy dose decreased the initial levels), evidencing that packaging and refrigeration are enough for preservation. These results suggest that the suitability of post-packaging irradiation for preserving total folates may depend not only on the applied dose but also on the plant matrix under analysis. In addition, new data useful to complete food composition tables or databases is provided.

AB Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are free glycans naturally present in human milk that act as prebiotics, prevent pathogen binding, modulate the immune system and support brain development in infants. The HMOs composition and concentrations vary significantly among different women mainly because of the direct influence of the Secretor and Lewis phenotypes on HMOs biosynthesis. Analytical methods that can identify the differences in the HMOs composition and concentrations are a fundamental tool in HMOs research. This paper describes a simple HMOs extraction and analysis for the simultaneous and absolute quantification of neutral and acidic HMOs by graphitized carbon liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. This method was validated and applied to analyze HMOs in the human milk obtained from 10 women. This method allows accurate and reliable quantification of HMOs and can be used to determine differences in HMOs concentrations throughout lactation and among women with different Secretor and Lewis phenotypes.

AB Lysozyme, an important bacteriostatic protein, is widely distributed in nature. It is generally believed that the high efficiency of lysozyme in inhibiting gram-positive bacteria is caused by its ability to cleave the beta-(1,4)-glycosidic bond between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine. In recent years, there has been growing interest in modifying lysozyme via physical or chemical interactions in order to improve its sensitivity against gram-negative bacterial strains. This review addresses some significant techniques, including sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), infrared (IR) spectra, fluorescence spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), UV-vis spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) spectra and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which can be used to characterize lysozymes and methods that modify lysozymes with carbohydrates to enhance their various physicochemical characteristics. The applications of biomaterials based on lysozymes in different food matrices are also discussed.

AB To improve the quality of potato steamed bread, the microbial diversity of 5 different sourdoughs and their effects on potato steamed bread were studied. The proximate composition analysis differentiated the Chinese traditional sourdough (CTS) with different levels of nutrients and pH (3.82-6.22). High-throughput sequencing revealed the predominant microbes in the five CTSs were Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, and Wickerhamomyces. Similarities of bacterial and fungal compositions were observed within them. The fermentation rheological results suggested CTS1 and CTS3 had higher total gas production value (2355.5 mL and 2249.5 mL respectively) than baker's yeast. CTSs resulted in various effects on the appearance and texture properties of potato steamed bread with CTS1 showed the highest specific volume (2.38 mL/g) and sensory score (7.43). Wickerhamomyces significantly correlated with the total gas production, hardness, resilience, and lightness of potato steamed bread. The study suggested a potential application of CTSs in fermented potato staple foods.

AB Parboiling is a common method used in rice processing to improve milling yield and physicochemical properties. The current study evaluates parboiling as a pre-treatment step in millet decortication and its impact on phenolic profile and in vitro digestibility of two traditional millet products, steam-cooked couscous and porridge, made from pearl (Pennisetum glaucum) and proso (Panicum miliaceum) millets. Parboiling increased decorticated yield of pearl and proso millet by 37% and 28% respectively. It resulted in significant (P < 0.05) rise in free and bound phenolic contents and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity of the millet products. This method significantly (P < 0.05) changed starch digestion fractions of both products thereby reducing expected glycemic index (eGI) while the in vitro protein digestibility of products decreased by 14-17%. Parboiling could be an effective way to improve millet decortication yield as well as produce millet products with higher phenolic acids antioxidant activity and lower GI.

AB Here, we validated a protocol for the elemental analysis of plant and food materials using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and pressed pellets in compliance with the Green Chemistry principles, i.e. avoiding the use of hazardous reagents. The protocol included sample pre-treatment, preparation of pellets, and LA-ICP-MS optimisation for the food sample matrix using leaf certified reference materials. Sample homogenisation and particle size reduction (similar to 10 mu m) for samples with larger initial particle sizes proved crucial in improving signal stability and analytical results, whereas the raster mode was preferred over spot mode for greater accuracy. The validation of the technique was successful for determination of Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Cd and Pb (z-score values <= 2). We propose LA-ICP-MS using pressed pellets as an alternative to ICP-MS in food analysis.

AB In order to assess the essential probiotic properties of a strain dedicated for administration in humans and animals, characteristics of finally formulated products, rather than the cells solely, seems to be of crucial importance. In this study, composition of protective blends for manufacture of L. lactis probiotic powders was optimized using a statistical experimental design. The powders, generated by either spray- or freeze-drying techniques, were subsequently subjected to storage testing, and in vitro digestion in simulated stomach and small intestine. Finally, maintenance of adherence capability to human enterocyte-like cell lines, was evaluated. Our data demonstrated that 10% trehalose ensures the highest viability of L. lactis bacteria upon both drying techniques (viability of 60-68%). Moreover, skimmed milk-protected spray- dried cells exhibit the highest resistance to harsh environmental conditions of stomach (53.9 +/- 7.6% survival rate) and higher adhesion ability to HT-29 cell line after digestion ( 528 +/- 29 cells per 100 epithelial cells).

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of phosphorylation on the sensitivity of mu-calpain to the inhibition induced by calpastatin. Purified mu-calpain was incubated with alkaline phosphatase (AP) or protein kinase A (PKA) to modulate the phosphorylation level of mu-calpain. Accurately 25, 50, 100 and 150 units of AP/PKA-treated mu-calpain were mixed with the same amounts of heat stable proteins and incubated at 4 degrees C. In the calpastatin-free system, AP and PKA-treated mu-calpain had higher proteolytic activity compared to the control. Intact AP-treated mu-calpain degraded fastest in the 50, 100 and 150 unit mu-calpain incubation systems. However, the degradation rate of mu-calpain in control and PKA group was non-significant in 100 and 150 unit mu-calpain systems. Our results demonstrated that, compared to dephosphorylated and control mu-calpain, calpastatin presents greater inhibition to PKA phosphorylated mu-calpain. This study increases understanding of the mechanism of mu-calpain activity regulated by phosphorylation.

AB Fermented lentil (FL) produced using L. plantarum and Savinase in alkaline conditions relieves metabolic alterations and oxidative stress in Zucker rats with metabolic syndrome. Here, we investigated the effect of up scaling the fermentation process on chemical composition and biological activity of FL. Moreover, we studied the molecular mechanisms by which FL exert a cytoprotective effect against oxidative stress in tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP)-challenged RAW264.7 macrophages. Up-scale production reduced overall biological effectiveness of FL with the exception of inhibition of intracellular ROS generation. FL prevented t-BHP-induced cytotoxicity and intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species through activation of catalase expression via SAPK/JNK phosphorylation and Nrf2 nuclear translocation. Different oligopeptides, phenolic acids and flavonols were identified as contributors of the observed effects. To the best of our knowledge, we reported for the first time that FL attenuates oxidative stress cellular damage via activation of SAPK/JNK phosphorylation, Nrf2 nuclear translocation and antioxidant enzymes expression.

AB Methods to detect the presence of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are evolving constantly to comply with legislation and include new transgenic traits developed by biotechnology companies. Since traditional screening methods target only a limited number of markers, not all GM-events can be detected easily. To cover a broader range, a new GMO screening method was developed, based on two real-time PCR reactions, targeting i) six major GM-markers and ii) six GM-events that do not contain these markers. This method used the FAST PCR technology and allowed a further reduction in time-to-result. Using a wide array of reference materials and proficiency test samples, the method showed a broad screening capacity and the absolute limit of detection was consistently below 20 copies, thereby demonstrating the method is fit-for-purpose.

AB Human milk is a dynamic protein-protease system that delivers bioactive peptides to infants. The pH of milk changes from the mother's mammary gland to the infant's digestive tract. Although the release of human milk peptides has been studied during in vivo or in vitro digestion, these models did not explicitly vary nor observe the effect of pH. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of pH on the proteolysis of human milk. Using high-resolution accurate-mass Orbitrap mass spectrometry, profiles of endogenous human milk peptides before and after incubation at various pH levels have been mapped. Over 5000 peptides were identified. Comparative analyses classified 74 peptides that were consistently found independent of pH alterations, and 8 peptides that were released only at pH 4 or 5 (typical infant gastric pH). Results documented that the proteolysis of milk proteins, particularly beta-casein, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, and alpha-lactalbumin, is pH-dependent.

AB This study aimed to investigate the effect of a low-frequency magnetic field (LF-MF; 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.4 mT) on the gel properties of pork myofibrillar protein ( MP) and to explore potential mechanisms. The water-holding capacity (WHC) and rheological properties of MP gels treated at 0.5 mT were better than those from other treatments. The water mobility did not change significantly as intensity increased, while the ratios of immobilized water (PT21) and free water (PT22) significantly decreased and increased, respectively. This suggested that the effect of LF-MF on MP hydration might be related to the formation of water clusters. Raman spectra suggested that alpha-helices unfolded and beta-sheets, beta-turns, and random coils were formed in MP gels (from 0.25 to 1.4 mT). Furthermore, the intensities of characteristic peaks in the tryptophan and aliphatic residues band were highest at 0.5 mT, indicating that 0.5 mT was the optimum intensity for hydrophobic interactions.

AB Clinical and laboratory studies have implicated black raspberries (BRBs) and their associated phytochemicals in the modulation of several chronic diseases. Most research on the health benefits of BRBs is conducted using freeze-dried or otherwise minimally processed products, yet BRBs are typically consumed as thermally processed goods like jams and syrups. The objective of this work was to profile the chemical changes that result from thermal processing of BRB powder into a nectar beverage. Using an untargeted UHPLC-QTOF-MS metabolomics approach, key degradation products of anthocyanins were identified along with several other proposed phenolic degradants. The effects of processing on other key BRB compound groups, including ellagitannins, are also discussed. This work demonstrates the utility of an untargeted metabolomics approach in describing the chemistry of complex food systems and provides a foundation for future research on the impact of processing on BRB product bioactivity.

AB Tropomyosin (TM), the predominant shellfish allergen, has induced severe food allergy worldwide, but efficient prevention and cure measures are limited nowadays. In the present study, we introduced an approach to eliminate Penaeus chinensis TM by Maillard reaction with reducing sugars including ribose, galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS) and chitosan-oligosaccharide (COS), which reduced the allergenicity by up to 60%. We also evaluated the conformational changes of TM during reaction by far-UV circular dichroism, and found the reaction-induced alternation from alpha-helix to beta-sheet. We further determined the effect of Maillard reaction on TM allergenic epitopes to investigate the detailed mechanisms, and revealed the structure preference of different sugars. Correlation analysis with experimental data revealed that a-helix mediated the allergenicity elimination by Maillard reaction. There results provided theoretical foundations for the improvement and application of Maillard reaction in allergenic food processing.

AB Simulating the process of traditional Chinese medicine decoction, Radix Pseudostellariae protein (RPP)-based nanoparticles were constructed by combining heat treatment with pH adjustment in succession. The formed nanoparticles were characterized as homogeneously dispersed sphere within 100 nm in diameter. With curcumin as a drug model, the potential application of RPP as a nanocarrier was studied. Curcumin could combine to RPP through hydrophobic interaction and quench the intrinsic fluorescence of RPP. Results of X-ray diffraction revealed that the crystal formation of curcumin was suppressed after the formation of nanocomplexes. In addition, the curcumin-loaded nanocomplexes exhibited good thermal stability and the light stability of curcumin was significantly improved. The curcumin-loaded nanocomplexes had stronger reducing power than free curcumin, which displayed additive effect between curcumin and RPP. In summary, the obtained RPP nanoparticles are potential to become new drug delivery carriers in food field and pharmaceutical applications for the encapsulation of hydrophobic components.

The procedure includes DNA isolation from fresh meat samples, amplification of specific DNA sequences and detection by the lateral flow assay. The proposed assay is rapid and has been applied for the identification of four animal species: horse, pork, beef and sheep. The detection is completed within 25-30 min after amplification. The assay offers high detectability and good selectivity and reproducibility. As low as 0.01% of horse and 0.02% of pork DNA were detectable in binary mixtures by the reported lateral flow device.

AB Here, a facile, label-free and sensitive lateral flow strip (LFS) biosensor for foodborne pathogens was established relying on the innovative introduction of Gram staining and the direct immunoreaction. Target bacteria can be directly marked with crystal violet (CV) by one-step staining which is superior to traditional signal marking techniques in LFS assay, and the method's selectivity can be guaranteed by high-specificity monoclonal antibody. With Salmonella Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) as a model target, this protocol can selectively detect 80 CFU mL(-1) S. Enteritidis within 11 min in the optimized conditions. Moreover, with Listeria monocytogenes as another model target, the biosensor shows a high universality for detections of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The unexpected applicability of biological dye tracer in strip biosensor reveals that the biological dye can be a potential tool serving as a universal signal tracer for pathogenic microorganisms in food safety monitoring and early clinical diagnosis.

AB With genetically modified (GM) food circulating on the market, a rapid transgenic food screening method is needed to protect consumer rights. The on-site screening efficiency of GM food testing is low. We report rapid sample-to-answer detection of GM papayas with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and a compact, portable, integrated microfluidic platform using microfluidic lab-on-a-disc (LOAD). GM samples were differentiated from non-GM papaya, based on the detection of a specific GM (P-35S (Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter)) and non-GM DNA marker (papain) in 15 min.

AB Effects of fertilization practices, mineral (M) and organo-mineral (OM), on molecular composition of Nero di Troia cultivar grape berries was studied using conventional chemical analysis, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and H-1 NMR spectroscopy on intact berries and extracts, respectively, and through analysis of yeast species developed on grape skins.
   Plants vegetative status did not differ between the two fertilization practices, whereas some grape juice chemical characteristics differed in fertilized grapes. MRI provided information on grape berries morphology through weighted images depending on spin-spin (T2) and spin-lattice (T1) relaxation times. T1 values were the highest in OM grape berries. H-1 NMR metabolic profile, combined with chemometric analysis, evidenced significant differences for some metabolites (valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, and malic acid). Furthermore, higher frequency of yeasts genus Starmella sp., isolated from OM grape berries contributed to reinforcing the found results on the physiological response of wine grape Nero di Troia to fertilization.

AB Betalains are nitrogenous plant pigments known for their high antioxidant capacity. For the first time, this antioxidant nature has been studied in an in vivo system using the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. The oxidative stress caused in the fluorescent strain TJ375 (hsp-16.2::GFP) was reversed by the presence of both natural and semi-synthetic betalains, with an ED50 value around 25 mu M for betacyanins and up to 10 mu M for betaxanthins, with indicaxanthin, the major pigments in prickly pear fruits, as the most effective betalain. The effect of model betalains on the lifespan of the wild-type N2 strain was carefully studied using the automatic platform "Lifespan Machine". In a search for different approaches to suppress progeny, pop-1 RNAi was used to avoid FUdR use. The presence of betalains in the medium, both as pure compounds and as enriched Opuntia extracts significantly increased the lifespan of C. elegans.

AB Chia expeller is a by-product of the extrusion process of chia seeds generated during oil production. Typically, this material is non-utilized or used for non-valuable applications. In the present work, the chia expeller was hydrolysed with Papain and the antioxidant properties of the resultant peptides were evaluated. Papain treatment of the chia seed expeller demonstrated an enrichment of low molecular weight peptides (molecular weight < 15 kDa) as determined by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF/MS analyses. Such peptides showed a potent radical scavenging effect in vitro against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) radicals in comparison with those non-hydrolysed samples. Taken together our results demonstrate the generation of functional peptides from the chia expeller by enzymatic hydrolysis with Papain. This value-added hydrolysate can be potentially included as a supplement in functional food and nutraceutical products.

AB We present an implementation of the absolute quantification (AQUA) method for monitoring of peptide abundance in complex mixtures of processed proteins. Specific peptide markers from meats (chicken, duck, goose, pork and beef) and common protein allergenic additives (soy, milk and egg white preparations) were chosen and synthesised with stable isotopes (C-13 and N-15) for use as internal standards. A wide range of food samples, from cooked or raw meat to sterilised pate, was analysed by a triggered multiple reaction monitoring mode experiment and triple quadrupole mass spectrometry for the direct measure of tryptic peptides representing the amounts of specific proteins. Considerable differences among the abundances of meat and non-meat proteins were observed, and illegal addition and replacement of ingredients were discovered, i.e. undeclared addition of pork and egg white proteins, and illegal substitution of veal, goose and duck meat with cheaper pork.

AB In this study, the effect of different supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) pressures (10-40 MPa) on phenolic compounds extraction in oils obtained from "horchata" by-products was evaluated, and the results were compared to those obtained after conventional oil extraction (CE). Moreover, the relationship between the individual phenolic compounds and the total antioxidant capacity as well as oil oxidative quality parameters was compared. The phenolic profile and contents were largely influenced by extracting conditions. The main phenolic compound obtained by SC-CO2 was the isohydroxymatairesinol, particularly at 30 and 40 MPa, while 3-vinylphenol was the predominant compound in oils extracted by CE procedure. Increasing SC-CO2 extraction pressures enhanced the extraction of phenolic compounds, along with improving the antioxidant capacity and oxidative quality of extracted oil. The principal component analysis indicated that the main phenolic compounds associated with TEAC values were those extracted by SC-CO2, which were inversely correlated to oxidative indexes.

AB The recovery of pepper phytochemicals present an interesting strategy in pursuit of new bioactive compounds and natural ingredients for agro-food, cosmetic and pharma industry uses, as replacements for the synthetic compounds and also in the valorisation of plant's by-products. Besides being used as a condiment, providing characteristic pungency, colour and flavour, the new pepper-derived ingredients could be used for the preservation and extension of industrial products' lifespan, as well as additives or technological ingredients with antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Moreover, the application of the new products in pharmaceutical formulas for the treatment of inflammatory and pain-related conditions is also a possibility, since peppers contain capsaicinoids, carotenoids, phenolic compounds, vitamin C and A, and minerals, such as iron and calcium, which have a health-promoting potential. Further studies on appropriate extraction protocols, stability, safety and bioactivity are necessary to provide novel and promising pepper ingredients for food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical applications.

AB Production of infant formulas involves high temperature processing for microbiological safety. However, heat processes generate Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs), including Ne-carboxymethyllysine (CML) formed between lysine and lactose. Formulas manufactured from cow or goat milk, with or without whey adjustment, or hydrolysates of cow whey proteins, were tested for CML levels using a commercially available ELISA kit. CML concentrations ranged from 2 to 210 mu g/g protein in formulas containing intact proteins. Median CML concentrations were up to 3-fold greater in formulas containing 60% whey protein compared with 20% whey protein, for both cow and goat formulas. Goat milk formulas contained 7 to 12-fold less CML than cow milk formulas. Formulas made from intact proteins contained lower CML compared to formulas using whey hydrolysates. Western immunoblotting techniques detected higher CML levels in whey proteins compared with casein. This study showed whey addition to infant formula significantly contributes to CML levels.

AB A series of new hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents (DESs), which are liquid at room temperature and have high density (> 1.4 g mL(-1)), were synthesized using hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as hydrogen-bond donor and L-carnitine/betaine as hydrogen-bond acceptor. Then these hydrophobic DESs were used as extraction solvents to establish dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) method for extraction of pyrethroids. The DES extraction phase was in the bottom after DLLME, being easy to be collected for analysis. After optimization by one-variable-at-a-time and response surface methodology, the enrichment factors of 265-360 were achieved for five pyrethroids. The proposed DLLME method coupled with HPLC has good performance: linear ranges of 0.25/0.5/1-100/200/400 ng/mL (r >= 0.9990), limits of detection of 0.06-0.17 ng mL(-1), relative recoveries of 85.1-109.4%, intra-day and inter-day RSDs below 7.5%. The novel DLLME method is simple, rapid, highly efficient and eco-friendly for extraction of pyrethroids in real tea beverages and fruit juices.

AB This present study tested the extent to which 2% w/v trehalose enhanced the proteins expression profile of Hanseniaspora uvarum Y3. Furthermore, it explored the relative gene expression of stilbene synthase (StSy), one of the vital defense-related genes found in the skin of grapes. The proteomics profile revealed that 29 proteins were differentially expressed out of which 26 were significantly up-regulated and 3 were download-regulated. The pathogenesis related (PR) and other protein spots were visible at 97.4 kDa and 14.4 kDa. Peroxiredoxin TSA1 and superoxide dismutase were the main proteins involved in defense response and both proteins were significantly up-regulated. The carbohydrate and energy metabolism proteins were also significantly up-regulated. The results revealed that the treatments were associated with substantial increase in peroxidase activity compared to the control. StSy relative gene expression level was observed to increase by 2.5-fold in grapes treated with the pre-enhanced H. uvarum compared to the control.

AB The formation of and dynamic changes in aroma during white tea processing have not previously been systematically investigated. In this study, advanced comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry was employed to investigate the mechanism of white tea aroma formation. A total of 172 volatiles were identified and mainly comprising endogenous volatiles, which displayed diverse change trends during the withering period. In this process, free aroma precursor amino acids and glycosidically bound volatiles (GBVs) were found to contribute to the formation of white tea aroma, with the differential expression of aroma-related key genes accounting for various accumulation of endogenous volatiles and GBVs. In addition, the drying was also shown to play an important role in the formation of white tea aroma. Our study provides the first characterization of white tea aroma formation and establishes a theoretical basis for quality control during white tea processing operations.

AB A noise-free bacterial colony counting method identifying noise (i.e., sausage, bacon, and millet fragments) with similar colors or shapes to those of colonies was developed for food quality assessment. First, spectral features corresponding to colony cluster regions and background regions (agar medium and food fragments) were extracted after collection of hyperspectral images. A cluster-segmenting calibration model that could identify colony clusters and background regions was developed. Second, spectral features of colony centers and borders were extracted, and a colony-separating calibration model that could separate single colonies from clusters (multiple colonies contacting each other) was developed. Third, each pixel of an agar plate hyperspectral image was identified using established calibration models, enabling the colonies on the agar plate to be counted successfully (R-2 = 0.9998). The results demonstrated that the proposed method could identify the noises caused by food fragments with similar colors or shapes to those of colonies.

AB Lotus seed kernel (LSK) has high starch content and possesses many bioactivities, which are mainly attributed to its phenolics. In the present study, LSK phenolics were extracted using aqueous glycerol, and the obtained phenolics and its starch properties were observed for their correlations. Response surface methodology indicated significant quadratic effect of temperature and significant linear effect of glycerol on LSK phenolics (p < 0.05). Temperature also had a significant effect on LSK starch solubility and swelling power and % leaching amylose (p < 0.05). Leaching amylose in the presence of glycerol and swelling power showed positive correlations with LSK phenolics in a linear relationship (r = 0.825, p < 0.01) below 50 degrees C and a monotonic relationship (r(s) = 0.933, p < 0.01) above 60 degrees C, respectively. A building block backbone model was adopted to illustrate the interaction between amylose/amylopectin-glycerol, and most importantly, their relationship to LSK phenolics.

Thus, we have tested a desktop scanner, a digital camera and a smartphone to determine iron using three standard colour reactions. Images of reacting solutions were analysed to obtain the RGB (red, green and blue) non-uniform colour space parameters. To improve the calibration linearity, sensitivity, and detection limit, we converted the RGB intensities into six uniform colour space values and two colour differences attributes. The converted signals surpassed the RGB signals and compared well with reference spectrophotometric signals. The simplicity and sensitivity of this approach make digital imaging devices as excellent competitors to field-monitoring instruments and sophisticated spectrophotometers. Our approach was successfully applied to the assessment of iron in Nile river water, soils, plant materials and meat and liver samples.

AB Rambutan seed is usually discarded during fruit processing. However, the seed contains a considerable amount of crude fat. Hence, the objective of this study was to investigate the fat properties and antinutrient content of the seed during fermentation of rambutan fruit. Results showed that the crude fat content of the seed reduced by 22% while its free fatty acid content increased by 4.3 folds after 10 days of fermentation. Arachidic acid was selectively reduced and was replaced by linoleic acid from the seventh day of fermentation onwards. Only 14.5% of triacylglycerol remained in the seed fat at the end of fermentation. The complete melting temperature, crystallization onset temperature and solid fat index at 37 degrees C of the fermented seed fat were higher than that of non-fermented seed fat. The saponin and tannin contents of the seed were reduced by 67% and 47%, respectively, after fermentation.

AB Vaccines are commonly used to control Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) in endemic regions and form an important part of contingency plans for FMD-free countries. Conventional FMD vaccines have numerous limitations, and the U.S. government supports the development of next-generation vaccines. In the U.S., vaccine efficacy is typically demonstrated through experimental vaccination and challenge of animals using the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) standards. Although conventional challenge and immunogenicity studies provide useful information, they have limitations and results do not always accurately predict field performance. Consequently, there is a need to test next-generation vaccines under field conditions to gain a better understanding of field performance to inform policy decisions and support their viability as a commercial product.
   In June 2017, an expert consultation was organised to discuss and define an optimal field study design for novel FMD vaccines. Cattle were the primary species considered, although parallel strategies for swine and small ruminants were also discussed. Many methodological and logistical considerations in the study design were identified, including: (1) study site selection and the importance of baseline studies to understand exposure risk, (2) ethics of using a placebo and assessing equivalence with conventional vaccines, (3) merits of using individual randomised versus cluster randomised trials, (4) preventive versus reactive vaccination, and (5) methods of randomisation and blinding.
   The proposed optimal study design was a multicentre (i.e. farm), three-arm, double-blind randomised controlled trial comparing groups receiving the novel vaccine to a conventional vaccine group and a placebo group. Large farms in areas of high exposure risk were identified as ideal study sites, and the primary study outcome was susceptibility to disease or infection, during a six-month observation period, following a single dose of vaccine. This report provides a summary of the important issues to consider when designing a field efficacy study in livestock and proposes a study design that could be utilised for novel FMD vaccines.

TI Persistence of bactericidal antibodies 4 years after a booster dose of

   (MenACWY-D)
SO VACCINE

DT Article
ID IMMUNOGENICITY; DISEASE; SAFETY
AB One dose of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) was first recommended for US adolescents (ages 11-12 years) in 2005 to protect against invasive meningococcal disease (IMD). In 2010, after evidence emerged about waning protection within 5 years after MenACWY vaccination, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended a MenACWY booster at age 16 years. We used a serum bactericidal assay with human complement (hSBA) to evaluate antibody persistence after a MenACWY-D booster in a sample of 110 participants who received the booster 4 years earlier in a phase 2 study. High proportions (89.9-98.2%) of participants maintained hSBA titers (>= 1:4) associated with protection against IMD; a majority (81.7-97.2%) also had hSBA titers >= 1:8, a more conservative threshold. These findings support ACIP recommendations regarding MenACWY booster vaccination, which are aimed at protecting adolescents and young adults throughout the period in which they are at increased risk of IMD.

AB Background: Despite the use of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) in adults there is substantial morbidity and mortality in the elderly due to pneumococcal infections. Since 2010, the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) is in use for infant immunization programs to reduce rates of pneumococcal disease, but is not routinely used in adults. Recent literature suggests PCV13 may be used in adult vaccination programs as well.
   Objective: To determine the immunogenicity and safety of PCV13 compared with the PPV23 in adults.
   Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Setting: Randomized controlled trials evaluating immunogenicity of a single dose of PCV13 and PPV23 in adults by the opsonophagocytic assay (OPA) geometric mean titer (GMT) response at 1-month post-vaccination were considered for inclusion.
   Results: Five randomized trials were included with 4561 subjects ranging 50-95.5 years, consisting of 51% females. The pooled OPA GMT ratio (GMTR) in the PCV13 arm was significantly higher for 10 of 13 serotypes (1, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 9V, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F) compared with the PPV23 arm. Overall, pooled risk ratios (RR) for local and systemic reactions did not differ between PCV13 and PPV23. Pneumococcal naive subjects experienced significantly higher local reactions in the PCV13 arm compared with the PPV23 arm (RR: 1.15, 95%Cl: 1.05-1.26, p = 0.0025).
   Conclusion: A single dose of PCV13 elicits a better immune response among adults compared with PPV23, while having a similar safety profile to PPV23. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB During the last decades pertussis incidence raised globally. Several vaccination strategies targeting adults to reduce pertussis among young infants have been proposed, including vaccination of healthcare workers (HCWs). The aim of this study was to analyse, by performing a systematic review of literature, published papers that evaluated Tdap coverage among HCWs, variables associated with vaccine uptake and efforts implemented to raise vaccination rates. We searched the MedLine, Embase, SCOPUS, LILACS, Web of Science and Cochrane for full-text studies that evaluated Tdap coverage in HCW. Two independent reviewers screened the articles and extracted the data. Twenty-eight studies published from 2009 to 2018 were reviewed. Most studies were conducted in the USA. Initial Tdap coverage varied from 6.1% to 63.9%. USA and France are the only two countries with studies evaluating Tdap coverage within HCWs using national data. In the USA, Tdap coverage in HCWs raised from 6.1% to 45.1% from 2007 to 2015. In the analysis of French national data, a Tdap coverage of 63.9% was observed. Five studies used interventions to raise Tdap coverage in HCWs. Two intervention studies implemented mandatory vaccination and three used educational strategies. All of them achieved coverages over 86%. Only eleven studies analysed the association of Tdap vaccination with variables of interest. Previous immunization with other vaccines recommended for HCWs (like influenza, hepatitis B and MMR) was positively associated with Tdap uptake in four studies. In conclusion, overall Tdap coverage among HCWs is low, but seems to increase over the years after the vaccine introduction and with implementation of interventions to increase coverage.

AB Introduction: Malaria transmission blocking vaccines (TBV) are innovative approaches that aim to induce immunity in humans against Plasmodium during mosquito stage, neutralizing the capacity of the infected vectors to transmit malaria. Pfs23001-EPA/Alhydrogel (R), a promising protein-protein conjugate malaria TBV, is currently being tested in human clinical trials in areas where P. falciparum malaria is coendemic with helminth parasites. Helminths are complex metazoans that share the master capacity to downregulate the host immune response towards themselves and also to bystander antigens, including vaccines. However, it is not known whether the activity of a protein-based malaria TBV may be affected by a chronic helminth infection.
   Methods: Using an experimental murine model for a chronic helminth infection (Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri - Hpb), we evaluated whether prior infection alters the activity of Pfs23001-EPA/Alhydrogel (R) TBV in mice.
   Results: After establishment of a chronic infection, characterized by a marked increase of parasite antigen-specific IgGI, IgA and IgE antibody responses, concomitant with an increase of systemic IL-10, IL-5 and IL-6 levels, the Hpb-infected mice were immunized with Pfs23001-EFA/Alhydrogel (R) and the vaccine-specific immune response was compared with that in non-infected immunized mice. TBV immunizations induced an elevated vaccine specific-antibody response, however Pfs23001 specific-IgG levels were similar between infected and uninfected mice at days 15, 25 and 35 post-vaccination. Absolute numbers of Pfs23001-activated B cells generated in response to the vaccine were also similar among the vaccinated groups. Finally, vaccine activity assessed by reduction of oocyst number in P. falciparum infected mosquitoes was similar between Hpb-infected and immunized mice with non-infected immunized mice.
   Conclusion: Pfs23001-EFA/Alhydrogel (R) efficacy is not impaired by a chronic helminth infection in mice. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: This study examined the impact of superstitious beliefs on influenza vaccine uptake and investigated the role of health beliefs as underlying psychological mechanisms. It is hypothesized that superstitious beliefs predict greater perceived risks in influenza and vaccines, which in turn affect influenza vaccine uptake.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey of Singaporeans and Singapore Permanent Residents aged between 21 and 70 (N = 668) was conducted using computer-assisted telephone interviews. The survey covered beliefs in superstition, health beliefs in influenza and vaccines, and influenza vaccine uptake intention and behavior using the Health Belief Model. Path analysis was adopted to examine the hypothesized model.
   Results: Approximately 60% of the sample had never obtained influenza vaccination. The path analysis found that superstitious beliefs significantly predicted higher perceived barriers and lower perceived benefits of vaccines, which in turn predicted a lower intention to take influenza vaccine in the next year and/or a lower probability of ever taking influenza vaccine. In contrast, superstitious beliefs predicted higher perceived susceptibility and severity of influenza that in turn predicted higher influenza vaccine uptake intention and/or probability. Examining demographic variables and past experience on influenza as control and confounding factors did not significantly affect the results.
   Conclusion: The findings imply that beliefs in superstitions can have mixed effects on vaccine uptake and intention through shaping beliefs of the disease and vaccines. Significant implications in health education and persuasion on vaccine uptake are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Some plant polysaccharides (PPSs) had been used as the adjuvants for systemic vaccination. In this study, we investigated whether PPSs could exhibit adjuvant effect at the mucosa. Groups of mice were intranasally immunized with Epimedium Polysaccharide (EPS), Trollius chinensis polysaccharide (TCPS), Siberian solomonseal rhizome polysaccharide (SSRPS) and Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) together with ovalbumin (OVA). Significantly higher levels of OVA-specific IgG in serum and secretory IgA in saliva, vaginal wash and intestinal lavage fluid were induced after immunization with OVA plus one of the four PPSs compared to OVA alone. Antigen absorption and TLR2 (Toll-like receptor 2) activation may be related to their mucosal adjuvant effect. Of note, when APS used as an adjuvant, intranasally vaccination with recombination UreB (rUreB, Urease subunit B) conferred more robust protection against Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Immunized with rUreB in combination APS resulted in mixed specific Th1 and Th17 immune response, which may contribute to the inhibition of H. pylori colonization. Though specific Th2-dominant responses were elicited when the other three PPS intranasally immunized with rUreB, no significant difference in the protective effect were found between those groups and rUreb alone group. Taken together, the four PPSs may be promising candidates for mucosal adjuvant, and APS could enhance rUreB-specific protective immunity against H. pylori infection. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Shigellosis, a major cause of diarrhea worldwide, exhibits high morbidity and mortality in children. Specificity of Shigella immunity is determined by the structure of the main protective O-antigen polysaccharide component incorporated into the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecule. Endotoxicity, however, precludes LPS clinical use. Thus, there is still no vaccine against the most prevalent shigellosis species (serotype S. flexneri 2a), despite ongoing efforts focused on inducing serotype-specific immunity. As LPS is highly heterogenous, we hypothesized that more homogenous pools of LPS might be less toxic. We developed a method to generate a homogenous S. flexneri 2a LPS subfraction, Ac-3-S-LPS, containing long chain O-specific polysaccharide (S-LPS) and mainly tri-acylated lipid A, with no penta- and hexa-acylated, and rare tetra-acylated lipid A. Ac-3-S-LPS had dramatically reduced pyrogenicity and protected guinea pigs from shigellosis. In volunteers, 50 mu g of injected Ac-3-S-LPS vaccine was safe, with low pyrogenicity, no severe and few minor adverse events, and did not induce pro-inflammatory cytokines. In spite of the profound lipid A modification, the vaccine induced a prevalence of IgG and IgA antibodies. Thus, we have developed the first safe immunogenic LPS-based vaccine candidate for human administration. Homogenous underacetylated LPSs may also be useful for treating other LPS-driven human diseases. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Triton X-100 (TX-100) is the most common surfactant used to split viruses during the production of influenza split-virus vaccines. It is a mild surfactant not known to denature the viral proteins; this property makes TX-100 useful for maintaining antigen conformational structure, and, as an added benefit, for partially stabilizing vaccine formulations against protein aggregation. Despite its benefits, TX-100 needs to be filtered out after virus splitting has been achieved, due to its toxicity in large quantities. Accordingly, residual TX-100 presence in vaccine formulations has implications for both formulation stability and safety, necessitating both accurate screening during processing to guide decision-making about filtration repeats and accurate quantitation in the final product. Accurate HPLC-based methods are used successfully for the latter but their use for routine screening during processing is far from ideal because they often require extensive sample preparation and are fairly slow, complicated and costly. Here, "deconstruction" of UV-Vis absorption spectra into components corresponding to different absorbing "species" is demonstrated as a novel and viable method for routine TX-100 screening in vaccine samples from different industrial processing steps. This method is fairly accurate and, more importantly, preparation-free, rapid, simple/user-friendly and comparatively inexpensive. It is evaluated in depth in terms of applicability conditions, limitations and potential for high-throughput adaptation as well as generalization to other complex biopharmaceutical formulations.

AB Background: A three year pneumococcal carriage study was set up in Belgium when the vaccination programme switched from a 13-valent (PCV13) to a 10-valent (PCV10) vaccine. We compared the first follow-up period (October 2016 - June 2017, year 2, Y2) for nasopharyngeal carriage, serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of S. pneumoniae with the baseline (January July 2016, year 1, Y1).
   Materials/methods: A single nasopharyngeal swab was taken in children (6-30 months), either attending one of the 112 day-care centres (DCCs), or visiting one of the 21 physicians for an acute otitis media (AOM). S. pneumoniae were cultured, screened for antimicrobial susceptibility, and serotyped.
   Results: In Y2, 1218 samples were collected. The majority of the Y2-children (>85%) was vaccinated appropriately for their age. Children in Y2 received either PCV13 only (DCC: 23.5%; AOM: 24.6%), PCV10 only (DCC: 29.8%; AOM: 37.7%), or a mix of both vaccines (DCC: 31.9%; AOM: 25.4%). Pneumococcal carriage rates were high (Y2, DCC: 68.2%; AOM: 64.8%). Among carriers, prevalence of PCV13 serotypes was low (Y2 vs Y1, DCC: 3.5% vs 5.4%; AOM: 7.6% vs 7.7%). Although prevalence of PCV13-non-PCV10 serotypes did not increase significantly compared to Y1 (Y2 vs Y1, DCC: 1.6% vs 0.9%; Y2 vs Y1, AOM: 5.1% vs 0.0%), the proportion of serotypes 3, 6A, 19A among PCV13 serotype carriers in DCC was significantly higher in Y2 (46.2% vs Y1: 16.0%, p-value = 0.034). Serotypes 23B and 15B were the predominant non-vaccine serotypes (Y2). Among detected strains, non-susceptibility to at least one of five antibiotics tested (penicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, levofloxacin, cotrimoxazole) was comparable to Y1 (Y2 vs Yl, DCC: 41.3% vs 42.4%; AOM: 49.4% vs 48.1%).
   Conclusion: After completion of the PCV13-to-PCV10 vaccine switch in Belgium, the proportion of PCV13-non-PCV10 serotypes (mainly 19A) significantly increased among PCV13 serotype carriers in DCC, stressing the need for strengthened surveillance as the PCV10-vaccinated population grows.

AB Reductive amination coupling an aldehyde-containing polysaccharide, generated by periodate oxidation, with the amino groups in protein has been widely used in the synthesis of glycoconjugate vaccines. The conjugation is often achieved under slightly basic conditions via a Schiffs base intermediate followed by its reduction with sodium cyanoborohydride. We observed that oxidized capsular polysaccharides such as Streptococcus pneumoniae type 6B (Pn-6B) and Haemophilus influenzae type a (HiA) underwent significant degradation during the conjugation in slightly basic media leading to sub-optimal glycoconjugates. Further study on oxidized Pn-3, Pn-6A, Pn-6C, Pn-2 polysaccharides and dextran provided evidence that the degradation is a result of base-catalysed 0-elimination. In contrast to HiA, Pn-2, Pn-3, Pn-6B polysaccharides and dextran, oxidized Pn-6A and Pn-6C polysaccharides were stable under basic conditions due to lack of the leaving group at the beta-position of the aldehyde. By performing conjugation of oxidized polysaccharides to bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate buffer at pH 6.0, 6.8, 7.2 and 8.0, we concluded that the reductive amination proceeds best in slightly acidic media, particularly with those beta-elimination susceptible polysaccharides.

AB Background: Vaccination of children with 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) led to declines in vaccine-type pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage among adults through indirect effects. In August 2014, PCV13 immunization of all U.S. adults >= 65 years of age was recommended. This study sought to define prevalence and serotype distribution of pneumococcal carriage among adults >= 65 years of age and to describe risk factors for colonization soon after introduction of PCV13 in adults.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey of non-institutionalized U.S. adults >= 65 years of age was conducted in four states in 2015-2016. Demographic information, risk factors for disease, PCV13 vaccination history, and nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs were collected. NP and OP swabs were processed separately and pneumococcal isolates were serotyped by Quellung reaction. Antimicrobial susceptibility of pneumococcal isolates was performed. NP swabs also underwent real-time PCR for pneumococcal detection and serotyping.
   Results: Of 2989 participants, 45.3% (1354/2989) had been vaccinated with PCV13. Fifty-five (1.8%) carried pneumococcus (45 identified by culture and 10 by real-time PCR only) and PCV13 serotypes were found in eight (0.3%) participants. Almost half (22/45) of pneumococcal isolates were not susceptible to at least one of the antibiotics tested. Vaccine-type carriage among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals was similar (0.2% vs. 0.1%, respectively). Respiratory symptoms were associated with higher odds of pneumococcal colonization (adjusted OR: 2.1; 95% CI =1.1-3.8).
   Conclusions: Pneumococcal carriage among non-institutionalized adults >= 65 years of age was very low. Less than 0.5% of both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in our study carried vaccine-type serotypes. Over a decade of PCV vaccination of children likely led to indirect effects in adults. However, given the low vaccine-type carriage rates we observed in an already high PCV13 adult coverage setting, it is difficult to attribute our findings to the direct versus indirect effects of PCV13 on adult carriage.

ID VIRUS DISEASE; ATTITUDES; GUINEA
AB Health care workers (HCW) are at high risk of Ebola virus disease (EVD) infection during epidemics and may contribute to onward transmission, and therefore HCW-targeted prophylactic vaccination strategies are being considered as interventions. To assess the feasibility of preventive HCW vaccination, we conducted a pilot survey on staff turnover and vaccine acceptance amongst 305 HCW in Freetown and Kambia districts of Sierra Leone.
   Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated which demographic and behavioural factors were associated with acceptance of a hypothetical new vaccine. We quantified the duration of employment of HCW, and used multivariable gamma regression to detect associations with duration of employment in current or any health care position. Finally, we simulated populations of HCW, to determine the likely future immunisation coverage amongst HCW based on our estimates of vaccine acceptance and employment duration.
   Most HCW we surveyed had a positive opinion of EVD vaccination (76.3%). We found that being a volunteer HCW (vs being on the government payroll) was associated with increased vaccine acceptance. We found that HCW have stable employment, with a mean duration of employment in the health sector of 10.9 years (median 8.0 years). Older age and being on the government payroll (vs volunteer HCW) were associated with a longer duration of employment in the health sector. Assuming a single vaccine campaign, with 76.3% vaccine acceptance, 100% vaccine efficacy and no waning of vaccine-induced protection, immunisation coverage was sustained over 50% until 6 years after a vaccination campaign. If vaccine-induced immunity wanes at 10% per year, then the immunisation coverage among HCW would fall below 50% after 3 years.
   Vaccinating HCW against EVD could be feasible as employment appeared stable and vaccine acceptance high. However, even with high vaccine efficacy and long-lasting immunity, repeated campaigns or vaccination at employment start may be necessary to maintain high coverage. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Although coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6) is generally recognized as a causative agent of herpangina in children, CV-A6 infections globally emerged as a new and major cause of epidemic hand-foot-and-mouth-diseases (HFMDs) around 2008. To clarify the longitudinal epidemiology of CV-A6, we carried out sequence and phylogenetic analyses for the VP1 and partially for the VP4-3D regions as well as antigenic analysis using 115 CV-A6 isolates and 105 human sera in Yamagata, Japan between 2001 and 2017. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that CV-A6 isolates were clearly divided into two clusters; strains in circulation between 2001 and 2008 and those between 2010 and 2017. Neutralizing antibody titers of two rabbit antisera, which were immunized with Yamagata isolates in 2001 and 2015, respectively, against 28 Yamagata representative strains as well as the prototype Gdula strain were 1:2560-1:5120 and 1:160-1:640, respectively. The neutralizing antibody titers among residents in Yamagata against the above two strains were similar. Our analyses revealed that there were cross-antigenicities among all analyzed CV-A6 strains, although the newly emerged strains were introduced into Yamagata around 2010 and replaced the previous ones. With regard to control measures, these findings suggest that we can prevent CV-A6 infections through the development of a vaccine that effectively induces neutralizing antibodies against CV-A6, irrespective of genetic cluster.

AB Toxoplasmosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite. Currently, no viable vaccine or effective drug strategies exist to prevent and control toxoplasmosis. T. gondii microneme protein 3 (MIC3), rhoptry protein 9 (ROP9), and surface antigen 2 (SAG2) are related to active invasion of the parasite. Hence, we constructed recombinant adenoviruses expressing TgMIC3, TgSAG2, or TgROP9 and evaluated the recombinant adenoviruses as potential vaccines against acute T. gondii infection in BALB/c mice. Mice immunized with the recombinant adenoviruses were measured the antibody levels, percentages of lymphocytes and actived T lymphocytes, cytokine productions, and the survival rates and time to evaluate the protective efficacy. Results showed that immunization with the bivalent or trivalent recombiant adenoviruses could strongly stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, resulting in effective immune protections against lethal challenge with the tachyzoites of T. gondii RH. These results indicated that the divalent and trivalent adenoviruses, especially Ad-ROP9-MIC3-EGFP, may be promising vaccine candidates against acute T. gondii infection. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB While the basic definition of vaccination-associated acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is relatively clear and easily understandable, it is often difficult to diagnose ADEM based on clinical findings alone. ADEM is actually a heterogeneous clinical syndrome that can be approximately characterized by encephalomyelitis with multiple inflammatory demyelination, autoimmune causes, and relationship with a preceding infection or vaccination. The differential diagnosis of ADEM should exclude the possibility of infectious or other autoimmune encephalitis. The occurrence of vaccination-associated ADEM is influenced by several factors including the health and ethnic status of the vaccinated individual, vaccine components, and environment. Cases suspected of vaccination-associated ADEM should be analyzed cautiously from multi-disciplinary perspectives. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the current study was to analyze physicochemical properties of bacterial cellulose (BC) produced by Komagataeibacter xylinus for various periods of time in stationary conditions with regard to its potential as a carrier for yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica) immobilization, and subsequently to correlate the relationship between these properties and the efficiency of the immobilization process. Physicochemical properties of BC, depending on the time of its biosynthesis, were as follows: surface area 7.21-11.04m(2)/g, pore volume 3.11-3.96 cm(3)/g, pore diameter 0.011-0.109 nm, water holding capacity 32-64%, water relies capacity 10600-33400%, swelling ratio 132-389%, polymerization degree 2260-4780 and total crystallinity index 1.22-1.96 (3-30 days, respectively). The linear regression analysis showed that number of immobilized yeasts increased with values of surface area, pore size, pore diameter, swelling ratio, water release capacity and polymerization degree. The opposite trend was observed in case of water holding capacity and total crystallinity index. The analysis of physicochemical properties of BC performed in the current study have significant translational implications for understanding the relationships between BC-based carriers and the efficiency of yeast immobilization.

AB Halogenated compounds, like 7-chloro-L-tryptophan, are important intermediates or components of bioactive substances relevant for the pharmaceutical, chemical and agrochemical industries. About 20% of all pharmaceutical small molecule drugs and around 30% of all active compounds in agrochemistry are halogenated. Chemical halogenation procedures usually are characterized by the use of hazardous or even highly toxic chemicals. Recently, a biocatalytic process for L-tryptophan halogenation at the gram-scale using FAD-dependent halogenase and NADH-dependent flavin reductase enzymes has been described. Many proteinogenic amino acids are produced by fermentation using Corynebacterium glutamicum. The fermentative production of L-glutamate and L-lysine, for example, is operated at the million-ton scale. However, fermentative production of halogenated amino acids has not yet been described. In this study, fermentative production of the halogenated amino acid 7-chloro-L-tryptophan from sugars, ammonium and chloride salts was achieved. This required metabolic engineering of an L-tryptophan producing C. glutamicum strain for expression of the genes coding for FAD-dependent halogenase RebH and NADH-dependent flavin reductase RebF from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes. Chlorination of L-tryptophan to 7-chloro-L-tryptophan by recombinant C. glutamicum was improved by optimizing the RBS of rebH. Metabolic engineering enabled production of 7-chloro-L-tryptophan and L-tryptophan from the alternative carbon sources arabinose, glucosamine and xylose.

AB Antibody-cytokine fusion proteins are a class of biopharmaceuticals, with the potential to modulate the activity of the immune system at the site of disease. The molecular format used to connect antibody moiety and cytokine payload can have a profound influence on biological activity and pharmacokinetic properties. The optimization of fusion protein format is particularly challenging for heterodimeric cytokines, since various molecular arrangements can be considered. In this article, we have explored the role of linker in a tumor-targeting IL12 fusion protein, based on the L19 antibody, specific to the extra-domain B of fibronectin. In biodistribution studies performed in tumor-bearing mice using radioiodinated protein preparations, fusion of human IL12 at the N-terminus of the L19 antibody in tandem-diabody format led to higher tumor uptake and improved tumor-to-organ ratios, compared to a similar fusion protein featuring L19 in IgG1 format. Moreover, optimization of the amino acid composition in eight variants of the linker connecting the IL12 moiety to the tandem-diabody revealed that a 15-amino acid linker (GSADGGSSAGGSDAG) displayed the best tumor targeting characteristics, with a long residence time at the tumor site and a rapid clearance from blood and normal organs. The product is being developed for industrial and clinical applications.

AB (R)-Pantolactone (PL) is a key chiral intermediate for the synthesis of calcium (R)-pantothenate and (R)-panthenol used as food additives. The commercial production of (R)-pantothenate is performed by the resolution of racemic pantothenate, which is synthesized through an aldol condensation and a cyanation reaction. In this study, we investigated another synthetic method of (R)-pantothenate through the stereoselective reduction of ketopantoyl lactone (KPL) by aldo-keto reductase (AKR). A series of conjugated polyketone reductases (CPRs) were discovered from GenBank database by genome mining approach. The putative CPR gene from Candida orthopsilosis Co 90-125 (CorCPR) was cloned and functionally expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The optimum pH and temperature of recombinant CorCPR were 6.0-7.0 and 40 degrees C, respectively. The K-m and nu(max) toward KPL were1.3mM and 227.3 mu mol/min/mg protein, respectively. The conserved sequences suggest that CorCPR belongs to AKR3C family of AKR superfamily. Furthermore, a catalytic tetrad was proposed, and the detailed mechanism was clarified by molecular docking. In a batch reaction, 50mM KPL was reduced to (R)-PL with 99% conversion and > 99% enantiomeric excess within 5 h. The recombinant CorCPR from C. orthopsilosis shows potential application in the asymmetric synthesis of (R)-pantothenate preparation.

AB Addressing the combination of heterocyclic chemistry and biocatalysis, a one-pot synthesis of a 3-thiazolidine by means of an initial Asinger-type multi-component-condensation reaction under formation of a 3-thiazoline and a subsequent enzymatic reduction of this cyclic imine is reported. The one-pot process is conducted in a sequential mode and without the need for a spatial compartmentalization of the single reaction steps. For the biocatalytic reduction an imine reductase was used in combination with a glucose dehydrogenase and D-glucose for in situ-cofactor recycling. This process has been applied successfully towards the synthesis of (S)-2,2,3-trimethyl-1-thia4-azaspiro[4.4]nonane on a 4.5 mmol scale leading to moderate conversion and excellent enantioselectivity of 99% enantiomeric excess.

DE Acetate; Glycolate; Metabolic engineering; Escherichia coli
ID ETHYLENE-GLYCOL; ACID PRODUCTION; PATHWAY
AB Escherichia coli was metabolically engineered to synthesize glycolate using acetate as the carbon source. The native glyoxylate bypass pathway was reinforced by the overexpression of isocitrate lyase and isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase. Glyoxylate/hydroxypyruvate reductase was overexpressed to convert glyoxylate to glycolate. Meanwhile, side reactions were eliminated by inactivating genes encoding malate synthase, glyoxylate carboligase, and glycolate oxidase to prevent loss of glyoxylate and glycolate. The engineered E. coli produced 1.78 g/L glycolate from 3.23 g/L acetate after 48 h shake flask cultivation using minimal medium supplemented with 1 g/L yeast extract. When citrate synthase, phosphotransacetylase, and acetate kinase were co-overexpressed to strengthen the tricarboxylic acid cycle and acetate utilization, glycolate production titer was improved to 2.75 g/L with pH control in shake flasks. The results of this work offer an approach for producing glycolate using acetate as the carbon source.

AB Rebuilding enzymes with high activities, stability and reusability has been constantly pursued for application of enzymaticcatalysis in wide field. Rebuilding enzymes by chemical approaches, including immobilization and chemicalmodification, represents a simple but effective route. Here, a class of highly stable and active reversible soluble-insoluble beta-D-Glucosidase (E-CB-ALD 5K) was prepared using mPEG-ALD (methoxy-polyethylene glycol aldehyde, molecular weight: 5k) as a site-specific modifier and Eudragit L-100(polyacrylic resin) as a carrier. The obtained rebuilding enzyme E-CB-ALD 5K was of high activity and recyclability. By the combination of the chemical modification and immobilization, E-CB-ALD 5K realized the homogeneous reaction and two phase separation for enzyme by controlling pH. Furthermore, E-CB-ALD 5K possesses strong thermal stability, alkaline stability, and the affinity between the enzyme and the substrate. The phenomenon was analyzed by circular dichroism analysis. The results showed that the E-CB-ALD 5K has more beta-fold structure that improves its stability.

AB In this study, two stereocomplementary omega-transaminases from Arthrobacter sp. (AsR-omega TA) and Chromobacterium violaceum (Cv-omega TA) were immobilized via iron cation affinity binding onto polymer-coated controlled porosity glass beads (EziG (TM)). The immobilization procedure was studied with different types of carrier materials and immobilization buffers of varying compositions, concentrations, pHs and cofactor (PLP) concentrations. Notably, concentrations of PLP above 0.1 mM were correlated with a dramatic decrease of the immobilization yield. The highest catalytic activity, along with quantitative immobilization, was obtained in MOPS buffer (100 mM, pH 8.0, PLP 0.1 mM, incubation time 2 h). Leaching of the immobilized enzyme was not observed within 3 days of incubation. EziG-immobilized AsR-omega TA and Cv-omega TA retained elevated activity when tested for the kinetic resolution of rac-alpha-methylbenzylamine (rac-alpha-MBA) in single batch experiments. Recycling studies demonstrated that immobilized EziG(3)-AsR-omega TA could be recycled for at least 16 consecutive cycles (15 min per cycle) and always affording quantitative conversion (TON ca. 14,400). Finally, the kinetic resolution of rac-alpha-MBA with EziG(3)-AsR-omega TA was tested in a continuous flow packed-bed reactor (157 mu L reactor volume), which produced more than 5 g of (S)-alpha-MBA (> 49% conversion,> 99% ee) in 96 h with no detectable loss of catalytic activity. The calculated TON was more than 110,000 along with a space-time yield of 335 g L-1 h(-1).

AB In this research, the separate production of hydrogen (H-2) and methane (CH4) from cassava wastewater with added cassava residue was investigated using a two-stage upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) system under thermophilic temperature (55 degrees C) in a continuous mode of operation and steady state condition. The two-stage UASB system was operated under an optimum chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading rate of 10.29 kg/m(3)d (based on the total volume of both bioreactors) of the cassava wastewater with different concentrations of added cassava residue. The recycle ratio of the effluent from the second bioreactor to the feed flow rate was fixed at 1:1 (v/v). In addition, the solution pH in the first bioreactor was controlled at 5.5, while that in the second bioreactor was not controlled. Under the optimum cassava residue concentration of 1200 mg/L, the produced gas from the first bioreactor contained 42.3% H-2, 55% carbon dioxide (CO2) and 2.70% CH4, while that from the second bioreactor contained 70.5% CH4, 28% CO2 and 1.5% H-2. Apart from a high H-2 and CH4 production performance (45.2 and 150% improvement, respectively, as compared to the system without added cassava residue) under the optimum cassava residue concentration (1200 mg/L) and the controlled COD loading rate (10.29 kg/m(3)d) of the cassava wastewater, the degradation performance of cellulose and hemicellulose were 41% and 22%, respectively, for the first bioreactor and 23% and 11%, respectively, for the second bioreactor. The digestibility of the cassava residue at thermophilic operation was higher than that at mesophilic temperature.

AB The present study evaluates the potential of encapsulated doxorubicin to reduce both the viability of melanoma cells and the tumor growth in a mouse melanoma model. The prepared doxorubicin loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles possessed mean diameter around 300 nm and negative zeta-potential. Classical molecular dynamic simulations revealed that the high encapsulation efficiency (above 90%) was mainly due to electrostatic interaction between doxorubicin and sodium alginate, although dipole-dipole and hydrophobic interactions might also contribute. The in vitro dissolution tests showed slower doxorubicin release in slightly alkaline medium (pH = 7.4) and faster release in acid one (pH = 5.5), indicating that higher concentration of doxorubicin might reach the acidic tumor tissue. The free and the encapsulated doxorubicin decreased the viability of melanoma cell lines (B16-F10 and B16-OVA) in a similar degree. However, the cytotoxic effect of the encapsulated doxorubicin still occurred in the more resistant B16-F10 cells even after removing the extracellular drug. The experiments on a syngeneic melanoma mouse model revealed that free and encapsulated doxorubicin elicited the control of the tumor growth (dose of 3 mg/kg). Thus, the encapsulation of doxorubicin into chitosan/alginate nanoparticles could be considered advantageous because of the better intracellular accumulation and longer cytotoxic effect on the investigated melanoma cells.

AB Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a mitochondrial respiratory cofactor and potent endogenous antioxidant. In CoQ10-deficient patients, early treatment with high-oral doses (5-50 mg/kg/day) can limit the progression of renal disease and the onset of neurological manifestations. Crystalline CoQ10 is lipophilic, water-insoluble, and poorly absorbed in the gut. Here, CoQ10 showed low bulk density, another important disadvantage in solid oral formulations. Thus, we propose the use of oleogels to maintain dissolved a high-dose of CoQ10 in medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, using ethylcellulose (EC) for gelling, and a surfactant (sorbitan monostearate -SMS- or lecithin). "True gels" were only obtained with the surfactant presence. Thermoreversible oleogels with 1 g of dissolved CoQ10 per 5 g-disk were successfully developed with proved stability and solubility for 12 months (25.0 degrees C). SMS was better than lecithin as a surfactant because it allowed lower syneresis, higher CoQ10 retention for 12 months, and notably higher oxidative-stability of the MCT-oil, best immobilized by its true gel network. Plastic deformation without fracture was determined under compression, emulating the soft deformation behavior inside the mouth. SMS-oleogels allowed loading a maximal solubilized CoQ10 dose with maximal stability, and may be easier to swallow by CoQ10-deficient patients who suffer from secondary dysphagia.

AB The purpose of this work was to develop a practical and scalable method to encapsulate the hydrophobic antibiotic thiostrepton (TST) in sterically stabilized micelles (SSM). Using the conventional method of thin-film hydration, we encapsulated up to 5 drug molecules per SSM (diameter similar to 16 nm). However, since this method is not suitable for large-scale production - a limiting factor for clinical translation - we applied the co-solvent freeze-drying method using tert-butanol (TBA): water co-solvent system. We found that the presence of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) salts in the lyophilized cake accelerated the reconstitution time and allowed efficient drug encapsulation without the formation of larger drug particles. In addition, TBA proportion of 50% (v/v) was sufficient to maintain both phospholipid and drug in solution prior to the freeze-drying. The increase of drug and phospholipid concentrations in the formulation extended the reconstitution time and led to drug precipitation. Therefore, to increase the strength of the formulation, we prepared lyophilized cakes with lower phospholipid content (5 mM) and reconstituted them in one-third of the fill volume. In conclusion, we found optimum conditions to prepare TST-SSM using the co-solvent freeze-drying method. This scalable production method can facilitate the further clinical development and industrial production of TST-SSM nanomedicine.

AB Pluronics are triblock copolymers, in which two hydrophilic poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) blocks are connected via a hydrophobic poly propylene oxide (PPO) block. Because of their low molecular weight and high content of PEO, Pluronics have demonstrated the micellization phenomenon, which is dependent on temperature and/or concentration. With an understanding of micellization phenomenon in more detail, information on the morphology, micelle core radius, aggregation behavior with critical micelle concentration (CMC) and critical micelle temperature (CMT) and so on has been revealed. Based on this acquired information, various studies have been performed for biomedical applications such as drug delivery systems, tissue regeneration scaffolders, and biosurfactants. This review discusses the delivery of small molecules and macromolecules using Pluronic-based NPs and their composites.

AB Inhalation is the preferred route for the treatment of lung diseases. More recently, also formulations for systemic treatment have been developed. For efficient development of inhalation products it is necessary to identify a link between particle parameters and in vivo performance. Such a relation exists for oral drugs where dissolution and permeation across Caco-2 monolayers are correlated to in vivo absorption. By contrast, the only in vitro parameter with established link to absorption for inhalation is particle size. In vitro dissolution could be another important parameter because low solubility determines bioavailability of inhaled drugs. The review highlights the importance of dissolution for drug availability in general and lists important differences in dissolution testing of oral and inhaled formulations. Dissolution testing protocols are summarized with focus on the composition of the various fluids, which are used to mimic particle dissolution in the deep lung. Finally, a role of in silico modelling in identification of physiologically relevant dissolution fluids and in in vitro in vivo correlation is suggested.

AB Human colon cancer is one of the higher aggressive solid tumors, whose high mortality, much like many other solid tumors, results from metastasis formation. To reduce this high mortality, more effective chemotherapy, allowing a specific tumor accumulation and an efficient early-stage medical imaging as well, are still needed. At this regard, stimuli-responsive nanocarriers for anticancer drug delivery are promising strategy in cancer therapy. For this purpose, a dual targeted redox-responsive drug delivery system, prepared by coating super-paramagnetic nanoparticles (SPIONs) with the amphiphilic copolymer INU-LA-PEG-FA and loading doxorubicin (DOXO-SPIONs) was investigated as tool for solid tumor chemotherapy. Folic acid (FA) has been chosen as active targeting agent as its receptor is upregulated in many tumors, including colon cancer. Lipoic acid (LA) has been used to act as the redox-responsive moiety, due to the presence of the -S-S- linkage into its structure, which can undergo intracellular reductive-induced cleavage, and therefore, a modification of stability and release profile of the nanocarrier. Accumulation by magnetic attraction was used as synergistic targeting strategy. Improved anticancer activity was demonstrated in mice by evaluating tumor volume reduction, immunohistochemical analyses and imaging properties using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

AB Within this paper we present work that has the ability to de-risk the translation of liposomes from bench to the clinic. We have used microfluidics for the rapid and scale-independent manufacture of liposomes and have incorporated in-line purification and at-line monitoring of particle size. Using this process, we have manufactured a range of neutral and anionic liposomes incorporating protein. Factors investigated include the microfluidics operating parameters (flow rate ratio (FRR) and total flow rate (TER)) and the liposome formulation. From these studies, we demonstrate that FRR is a key factor influencing liposome size, protein loading and release profiles. The liposome formulations produced by microfluidics offer high protein loading (20-35%) compared to production by sonication or extrusion ( < 5%). This high loading achieved by microfluidics results from the manufacturing process and is independent of lipid selection and concentration across the range tested. Using in-line purification and at-line size monitoring, we outline the normal operating range for effective production of size controlled (60-100 nm), homogenous (PDI < 0.2) high load liposomes. This easy microfluidic process provides a translational manufacturing pathway for liposomes in a wide-range of applications.

AB In this paper, nutriosomes (phospholipid vesicles associated with Nutriose (R) FM06) were modified to obtain new systems aimed at enhancing the efficacy of curcumin in counteracting malaria infection upon oral administration. Eudragit (R) L100, a pH-sensitive co-polymer, was added to these vesicles, thus obtaining eudragit-nutriosomes, to improve their in vivo performances. Liposomes without eudragit and nutriose were also prepared as a reference. Cryo-TEM images showed the formation of multicompartment vesicles, with mean diameter around 300 nm and highly negative zeta potential. Vesicles were stable in fluids mimicking the gastro-intestinal content due to the high phospholipid concentration and the presence of gastro-resistant eudragit and digestion-resistant nutriose. Eudragit-nutriosomes disclosed promising performances in vitro and in vivo: they maximized the ability of curcumin to counteract oxidative stress in intestinal cells (Caco-2), which presumably reinforced its systemic efficacy. Orally-administered curcumin-loaded eudragit-nutriosomes increased significantly the survival of malaria-infected mice relative to free curcumin-treated controls.

AB Assembled between gamma-cyclodextrins (CD) and potassium ions, gamma-cyclodextrin metal-organic frameworks (CDMOF) create spatially extended and ordered cage-like structures. Herein, it was demonstrated that folic acid (FA), a model molecule, could be densely packed inside CD-MOF reaching 2:1 FA:CD molar ratio. This "Ship-ina-Bottle" strategy leads to a 1450 fold increase of the apparent solubility of FA. Moreover, the bioavailability of FA inside CD-MOF in rats was enhanced by a factor of 1.48 as compared to free FA. The unique mechanism of FA incorporation in the CD-MOF 3D network was also explored, which was different from the conventional CD inclusion complexation. Taylor dispersion investigations indicated that FA was incorporated on the basis of a two-component model, which was further supported by a set of complementary methods, including SEM, XRPD, BET, SR-FTIR, SAXS and molecular simulation. The hypothesized mechanism suggested that i) tiny FA nanoclusters formed inside the hydrophilic cavities and onto the surface of CD-MOF and ii) FA was included inside dual-CD units in CD-MOF. In a nutshell, this dual incorporation mechanism is an original approach to dramatically increase the drug apparent solubility and bioavailability, and could be a promising strategy for other poorly soluble drugs.

AB Cisplatin-based chemo-radiotherapy (RT) is the most effective treatment in patients with loco-regionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, traditional chemotherapy drugs have low bioavailability and targeting ability, which reduce their antitumor effects. Therefore, we developed a chitosan/ cis-dichlorodiamineplatinum (CS/DDP) hydrogel-based drug delivery system for the in situ treatment of NPC in combination with RT, and investigated their synergistic antitumor efficacy and underlying mechanism of action. CS/DDP hydrogel remarkably prolonged the survival time (81 days) when combined with RT compared to the control group (P < 0.01). The main mechanism was likely the increase in cancer cell apoptosis (76.23 +/- 1.13%, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the CS/DDP hydrogel in combination with RT also increased X-rayinduced DSBs and gamma-H2AX foci, induced G2/M phase arrest, inhibited cell proliferation by blocking Ki-67, and decreased CD31 + micro-vessel density (MVD). These results underscore the therapeutic potential of the combination of CS/DDP hydrogel and RT for localized NPC.

AB Pediatric population is a sensitive sector of the healthcare and pharmaceutical field with additional needs compared to the adult population. Extemporaneous formulations for children are generally prepared by manipulating adult formulations, but medication errors can result in suboptimal efficacy and with significant safety concerns. The aim of proposed project was to explore a 3D printing technology for the development of customized minicaplets of baclofen for the pediatric population. Based on results of 3-point bend test, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with sorbitol (10% w/w) were selected for preparation of baclofen loaded filaments using hot melt extrusion (HME). Effect of dimension, infill percentage and infill pattern on dose, disintegration time and release profile were investigated. Characteristic crystalline peaks of baclofen were absent in DSC thermograms and XRD pattern of filament and minicaplets. Minicaplets printed in diamond (fast) infill pattern with 100% infill showed higher disintegration time (38 mins) compared to linear, sharkfill and hexagonal pattern. 3(2) full factorial orthogonal design suggested that baclofen release (D50 and D85) was marginally affected by infill percentage but significantly affected by caplet dimension (p < 0.05). Thus, low cost FDM 3D printing technique can be a promising alternative for preparation of dose and release customized pediatric dosage forms.

AB Aerosol antibiotics are an interesting alternative to oral or intravenous therapy in Cystic Fibrosis lung infections. Levofloxacin (LVX) inhaled solution is already an effective option. In this study, the aim was the development of LVX-loaded PLGA microspheres (MS) for pulmonary administration as a dry powder. MS were prepared, for the first time, by a modified double emulsion solvent evaporation method with premix membrane homogenization. Aqueous phases were saturated with LVX and a fatty acid (lauric acid) was added to avoid the drug escaping from the organic phase. MS were characterized in terms of size, drug content, morphology and in vitro release properties. X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, differential and gravimetric thermal analysis, and cytotoxicity analyses were performed. Results showed this new method increased the drug loading while maintaining an adequate (similar to 5 mu m) particle size and controlled release. Compared to a solution for inhalation, these properties combined with the dry-powder nature of these MS will improve patient compliance. The incorporation of lauric acid was not advantageous because the particle size was higher and no improvements concerning the sustained release occurred. LVX was molecularly dispersed in the matrix, or it was in amorphous state, as confirmed by the physico-chemical analyses. Calu-3 cell viability assays demonstrated no cytotoxicity for these MS, making them a promising system for LVX pulmonary delivery.

AB Olanzapine (OLZ), a drug for the treatment of schizophrenia, presents in more than 60 crystal forms. Polymorphs I, II and III were reported, however, the preparation conditions for pure II and III have not been reported. Polymorph IV was reported but this form is actually polymorph II described at different temperature. The diversity of solid forms of OLZ, the change in the nomenclature found in the literature and the presence of polymorphic mixture in samples, increase the difficulty for a correct solid state characterization. Therefore, the goal was the polymorphic identification of three OLZ raw materials, highlighting the limitation of conventional techniques (typically used in analytical control) and the necessity to use a combination of advanced ones to solve this challenge. The samples were studied by conventional techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction, thermoanalytical techniques, infrared spectroscopy. In apart from that, synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (SPXRD) and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (ss-NMR) were used. All samples were in accordance with the pharmacopoeia criteria. However, the conventional techniques were not specific for the complete polymorphic identification. Therefore, a combination of advanced techniques (SPXRD and ss-NMR) was necessary to identify the mixture of polymorphs (I, II and III) in all samples.

AB This work reports the anti-pathogenic effect of a commercially available water-based probiotic suspension, Symprove (TM), against three commonly encountered infectious organisms; Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Shigella sonnei. An isothermal calorimetric assay was used to the monitor growth of the species individually and in binary combinations, while colony plate counting was used to enumerate viable cell numbers. It was observed that all pathogenic species were faster growing than the probiotic bacteria in Symprove (TM) after inoculation into growth medium yet in all instances bacterial enumeration at the end of the experiments revealed a significant reduction in the pathogen population compared with the controls. A control population between 10(8) and 10(9) CFU/ml was obtained for E. coll. and S. sonnei whilst approximately 10(6) CFU/ml was obtained for MRSA. Upon co-incubation for 48 h, no viable counts were obtained for E. coli; a 4-log reduction was obtained for S. sonnei whilst MRSA numbers were down to less than 10 cells/ml. The results show that Symprove (TM) has antipathogenic activity against E. coli, S. sonnei and MRSA.

AB The in vitro skin penetration of pharmaceutical or cosmetic ingredients is usually assessed in human or animal tissue. However, there are ethical and practical difficulties associated with sourcing these materials; variability between donors may also be problematic when interpreting experimental data. Hence, there has been much interest in identifying a robust and high throughput model to study skin permeation that would generate more reproducible results. Here we investigate the permeability of a model active, niacinamide (NIA), in (i) conventional vertical Franz diffusion cells with excised human skin or porcine skin and (ii) a recently developed Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeation Assay (PAMPA) model. Both finite and infinite dose conditions were evaluated in both models using a series of simple NIA solutions and one commercial preparation. The Franz diffusion cell studies were run over 24 h while PAMPA experiments were conducted for 2.5 h. A linear correlation between both models was observed for the cumulative amount of NIA permeated in tested models under finite dose conditions. The corresponding correlation coefficients (r(2)) were 0.88 for porcine skin and 0.71 for human skin. These results confirm the potential of the PAMPA model as a useful screening tool for topical formulations. Future studies will build on these findings and expand further the range of actives investigated.

AB Precipitation testing, especially for weakly basic APIs, represents a key parameter in drug substance characterization during early development stages, where the amount of API available is limited. Therefore, it was the aim of this study to develop an automated small-scale in vitro transfer model to characterize the supersaturation and precipitation behavior of two poorly water-soluble drugs. Following automation and scale-down of the standard transfer model, the developed small-scale model was used to assess the impact of gastrointestinal variability, i.e. gastric pH, gastric emptying, and gastrointestinal fluid volumes, on supersaturation and precipitation of two weakly basic model compounds, ketoconazole and a new chemical entity from the research laboratories of Merck KGaA, MSC-A. The experiments revealed that variations in gastrointestinal parameters affected the in vitro behavior of ketoconazole, but not of MSC-A. Elevated gastric pH, as it can result from comedication with acid-reducing drugs, resulted in lower degrees of supersaturation for both substances. This result is in agreement with the observation that the oral bioavailability of ketoconazole is lowered when proton pump inhibitors are co-administered. The small-scale transfer model presented herein represents a valuable in vitro tool to assess the risk of drug precipitation, additionally covering a broad range of gastrointestinal parameters.

AB Maytansine and its related analogues are a class of highly potent anti-proliferation agents that have failed to be exploited as clinical drugs for human therapy due to unacceptable systemic toxicity. Here, we delineate a novel strategy that combines rational drug conjugation with subsequent nanoparticle assembly to systemically deliver this highly potent and toxic drug. To demonstrate this concept, we covalently coupled the thiolated maytansine derivative, the DM1 agent, to amphiphilic block co-polymers, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-block-polylactide (PLA), in varying molecular weights to generate two prodrug constructs (i.e., PEG(2K)-PLA(2K)-DM1 and PEG(2K)-PLA(4K)-DM1) via the maleimide-thiol reaction. The resulting two constructs are amenable to self-assembly in aqueous solutions and are systemically injectable for preclinical studies. In vivo evaluations indicate that PEG-PLA-DM1 conjugate-assembled nanoparticles (NPs) display substantially reduced drug toxicity compared to the free drug forms and NPs that physically encapsulate DM1. Furthermore, following systemic administration, these nanodrugs produced superior therapeutic efficacy over free DM1 in a colon tumor xenograft-bearing mouse model. Therefore, this study provides evidence that the conjugation of toxic drugs to assembling copolymers enables the alleviation of cancer drug toxicity and effective delivery of anticancer drugs. Thus, this DM1-formulated platform represents a new generation of nanotherapeutics that are available for further clinical evaluation.

AB Quizartinib, a second-generation FLT3 inhibitor, is in clinical development for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. We studied its pharmacokinetic interactions with the multidrug efflux transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2 and the multidrug metabolizing enzyme CYP3A, using in vitro transport assays and knockout and transgenic mouse models. Quizartinib was transported by human ABCB1 in vitro, and by mouse (m)Abcb1 and mAbcg2 in vivo. Upon oral administration, the brain accumulation of quizartinib was 6-fold decreased by mAbcb1 and 2-fold by mAbcg2 (together: 12-fold). Unexpectedly, the absence of mAbcb1 resulted in a similar to 2-fold lower plasma exposure in Abcb1a/1b(-/-) and Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2(-/-) mice, suggesting that loss of mAbcb1 causes compensatory alterations in alternative quizartinib elimination or uptake systems. mAbcb1 and mAbcg2 themselves did not appear to restrict quizartinib oral availability. Oral and intravenous pharmacokinetics of quizartinib were not substantially altered between wild-type, Cyp3a knockout and CYP3A4-humanized mice. All three strains showed relatively high (33-51%) oral bioavailability. If this also applies in humans, this would suggest a limited risk of CYP3A-related inter-individual variation in exposure for this drug. Our results provide a possible rationale for using pharmacological ABCB1/ABCG2 inhibitors together with quizartinib when treating malignant lesions situated in part or in whole behind the blood-brain barrier.

AB Vaginal candidiasis is considered a frequent opportunistic mucosal infection and the second most common cause of vaginitis after bacterial vaginosis. In this work, different vaginal films based on chitosan, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and blends of these polymers containing tioconazole, were developed and thoroughly characterized to improve the conventional therapeutics of vaginal candidiasis. Mechanical properties, swelling, adhesiveness, morphology, antifungal activity, hemocompatibility and cytotoxicity were evaluated. The drug solid state in the films was analyzed by thermal and X-ray diffraction analysis. Films showed homogeneous surfaces and presented similar mechanical properties and adhesiveness. Time-kill studies displayed that films were more active than both tioconazole pure drug and traditional tioconazole ovule against Candida albicans, which is probably related to the fact that tioconazole is in amorphous state inside the films. Although all formulations proved to be hemocompatible, films based only on chitosan exhibited a certain degree of cytotoxicity and therefore they should be avoided. The system based on chitosan-hydroxypropyl methylcellulose with 40% PEG 400 as plasticizer presented fast antimicrobial activity as well as the lowest swelling. Additionally, this formulation did not produce substantial hemolytic and cytotoxic effects, indicating that films based on chitosan-hydroxypropyl methylcellulose could be a promising alternative dosage form for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis.

AB Glaucoma treatment with ocular medications requires overcoming the corneal barrier to drug penetration. Liposomes have a great corneal penetration ability and affinity while suffering from poor stability and low entrapment of hydrophilic drugs accompanied by rapid drug release. This work aims to develop a new, effective and stable glaucoma medication with sustained drug release properties; Timolol maleate gelatinized core liposomes. A full factorial design was utilized to study the effects of three formulation variables on drug loading and vesicle particle size. Vesicles were prepared by the thin-film hydration method, and characterized for in-vitro drug release and stability. Intra-ocular pressure (IOP) reduction was evaluated in-vivo on glaucomatous rabbit's eyes. The safety profile was assessed using histopathological examinations. Gelatin significantly increased the drug entrapment percentage reaching 50% with a particle size of 38.81 mu m. Sustained drug release was recorded compared to a marketed product and to a conventional liposomal formulation. The prepared vesicles caused the highest reduction in IOP accompanied by safe histological findings. This work provided a new, safe and effective ocular glaucoma medication; Timolol maleate gelatinized core liposomes, solving the main problems of ocular liposomal formulations of hydrophilic drugs, suitable for the pharmaceutical industry and comprising abundant and relatively cheap components.

AB Screw feeders are integrated as dispensing units in most continuous manufacturing platforms. Hence, characterizing and modelling the residence time distribution (RTD) of materials in feeders is indispensable to understand the traceability of raw materials from the drum till tablet, enabling the separation of non-confirming material. The proposed methodology addressed this leap in knowledge by characterizing materials, performing RTD trials according to an experimental design, applying RTD models and establishing a partial least square (PLS) regression model that links the material properties and process variables with the RTD responses as outputs. Results showed that RTD in screw feeders can be represented by a combination of plug-flow and mixed-flow. Three variables were found to impact the residence time distribution in feeders: flow rate, hopper level and conditioned bulk density. Interestingly, the plug-flow fraction was not affected by variation in flow rate or material properties. Consequently, simple PLS models could be developed that use density and flow rate to predict RTD at a given hopper level. This approach is powerful for RTD prediction based on bulk density in the early phases of development when control strategies for clinical manufacturing need to be established and material availability is still limited.

AB Nanocrystals has been constructed for insoluble drugs as a novel type of nanoscale drug delivery systems with high drug loading. How to prepare nanocrystals with good stability and tumor targeting capability is still challenging. This study was to modify paclitaxel nanocrystals with polyethylene glycol (PEG) for stabilization and RGD peptide for tumor targeting. Inspired by the structure of mussels foot protein, polydopamine (PDA) was introduced to the drug delivery system for the modification of nanocrystals. Briefly, PDA was coated on the surface of nanocrystals to form a reaction platform for further PEGylation and RGD peptide conjugation. PEGylated nanocrystals with RGD peptide modification (NC@PDA-PEG-RGD) were prepared with near-spheroid shape, drug loading 45.12 +/- 1.81% and a hydrodynamic diameter 419.9 +/- 80.9 nm. The size of NC@PDAPEG-RGD remained basically unchanged for at least 72 h in the presence of plasma while the size of unmodified nanocrystals (NC) increased and exceeded 1000 nm in 12 h. Cellular uptake and cellular growth inhibition experiments using the lung cancer cell line A549 demonstrated the superiorly of NC@PDA-PEG-RGD over NC or PEGylated nanocrystals without RGD modification (NC@PDA-PEG). In A549 model tumor bearing-mice, NC@PDA-PEG-RGD showed significantly higher intratumor accumulation and slower tumor growth than NC@PDA-PEG or free paclitaxel. In summary, our study suggested the superiority of RGDmodified PEGylated paclitaxel nanocrystals as a lung cancer-targeted delivery system and the potential of PDA coating technique for targeting functionalization of nanocrystals.

AB Nanoemulsions as synergists of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) have been widely investigated, since they possess huge potential for improving the efficiency to ablate tumor. However, their clinical applications are limited due to the unsatisfactory phase-transition effect of nanoemulsions during the process of generating nanobubbles. Herein, a novel synergist for HIFU therapy was designed by encapsulating 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane (CFC) into pH-sensitive pullulan-doxorubicin (Pu-DOX/CFC) nanoparticles. These Pu-DOX/CFC nanoemulsions, with moderate vaporization temperature threshold of 47 degrees C, could provide favorable phase-transition effect, thus facilitating HIFU energy deposition. Meanwhile, Pu-DOX/CFC nanoemulsions could effectively deliver DOX/CFC to the tumor site and carry out combined therapy. The in vitro and in vivo results confirmed that Pu-DOX/CFC nanoemulsions notably enhanced both ablation and therapeutic efficiency comparing with other synergists. In conclusion, Pu-DOX/CFC nanoemulsions might serve as a novel synergist for HIFU therapy, and possess great potential in clinical implication.

AB In present investigation, gelatin-based (AA-co-AMPS) hydrogels were prepared using N, N'Methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) as a cross-linker and ammonium per sulfate (APS) as an initiator. The successful crosslinking and network formation was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT IR). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) investigations proved the higher thermal stability and successful entrapment of oxaliplatin (OXP) in the polymeric network. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed the loss in crystallinity of the drug after loading in the hydrogel. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the porous surface of the hydrogel. The newly formed hydrogels were responsive to change in pH. The swelling, drug loading and drug release was increased with increase in concentration of acrylic acid (AA) while gelatin and 2-acrylamido 2-methylpronesulfonic acid (AMPS) were found to act inversely. The in-vitro enzymatic degradation study showed that the blank hydrogels were more stable against the blank PBS than the collagenase and lysozyme. MIT-assay proved that the blank hydrogels were cyto-compatible while free OXP as well as OXP-loaded hydrogels showed dose dependent controlled cytotoxicity against Vero, MCF-7 and HCT-116 cell lines. The preliminary safety evaluation and oral tolerability showed that the hydrogel suspension was biocompatible and well tolerable upto 4000 mg/kg of body weight without causing any hematological or histopathological changes in rabbits.

AB This study investigated the impact of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) viscosity grade, HPMC proportion and particle size fraction on the physical properties of the freeze-dried mannitol-HPMC excipients produced, using multivariate analysis methods. Solutions containing 20%, w/w mannitol-HPMC were freeze-dried and milled to obtain excipients of size fractions 125-355 mu m and 355-710 mu m to understand the impact of the formulation variables on the molecular, particle and bulk properties of the excipients. Results showed that the freeze-dried mannitol-HPMC excipients were mainly differentiated by 3 overarching properties, in the order of their contribution to the variation in the principal component analysis (PCA) model: (i) freeze-dried cake strength and bulk fill-related properties, (ii) compression behaviour-related properties, and (iii) flow-related properties. These properties were influenced by the HPMC viscosity grade, HPMC proportion and size fraction of excipient used. Freeze-dried excipients containing vLV or lower HPMC proportions had higher bulk densities, thus displaying better packing within the die. For larger excipients, densification by plastic deformation was likely preceded by fragmentation, thus accounting for the higher yield pressure values. The establishment of inter-variable relationships between the physical properties would be useful in further studies on the functional properties of tablets containing these co-freeze-dried mannitol-HPMC tableting excipients.

AB Microneedle-devices provide a promising alternative to syringe-injection-based administration of chemotherapeutics. Dissolvable polymeric microneedles provide possibility of carrying greater payload and dual drugs. Here, we report development of polyvinyl pyrrolidone and polyvinyl alcohol composite dissolvable polymeric microneedle system for co-delivery of doxorubicin HCl and docetaxel. Microneedle patches were characterized using stereomicroscope, scanning electron microscope, texture analyzer and confocal microscope. The greatest amount of doxorubicin and docetaxel loaded within one microneedle patch was 533 +/- 65 and 227 +/- 23 mu g, respectively. Ex-vivo studies in excised murine skin revealed insertion of microneedles and permeation of chemotherapeutics without lag time. Microneedles dissolved within 1 h of insertion in excised skin. Effectiveness of the delivery system was determined in 4T1 breast cancer cells xenografted athymic Balb/c mouse model. Intra-tumoral injection of doxorubicin and doxorubicin + docetaxel combination showed significant toxicity to animals evidenced by drastic reduction in the body weight and 100 percent death within 9-days and after 2-dose administration. Interestingly, doxorubicin and docetaxel administered using microneedles either alone or in combination showed significantly greater survival (100% survival after 16-days and 4-dose administration) compared with intratumoral injections. The normalized body weight, tumor volume and DNA fragmentation assay indicated superior effect of microneedle patch application. Furthermore, co-delivery of doxorubicin and docetaxel, controlled the tumor growth better than the administration of single molecules. Taken together, minimally invasive dissolvable microneedle patch application could compliment painful catheter assisted syringe injections to deliver combination chemotherapeutics.

AB In vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC), a predictive mathematical model between the in vitro dissolution and the in vivo pharmacokinetics has been utilized for the development of new extended release (ER) formulations. The aim of the present study was to extend the IVIVC approach, which correlates among the formulation composition, the in vitro dissolution, and the plasma drug concentration, to predict plasma drug concentrations from a given composition of the formulation, and vice versa, using baclofen as a model drug. Baclofen ER tablets with different dissolution rates were prepared by varying the composition of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC). First, the HPMC compositions and the corresponding in vitro dissolutions parameters were correlated, and then the in vitro dissolution parameters were correlated with the in vivo dissolution parameters extracted from the pharmacokinetic profiles of the baclofen ER formulations via population pharmacokinetic modeling. The final extended IVIVC model linked the composition of the formulation, the in vitro dissolution, and the in vivo plasma concentration profile and was successfully applied for the prediction of in vivo pharmacokinetics from the amount of HPMC in baclofen ER formulations. The present approach holds great promise for designing optimal compositions of ER formulations to present desired plasma concentration profile.

AB The engineering of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) for biomedical use has received great interest over the past decade. In the present study we investigated the biocompatibility of IONPs grafted with linear (2P) or generation 1 (2PG1) or 2 (2PG2) dendronized oligoethyleneglycol units in THP-1-derived macrophages. To evaluate IONP effects on cell functionality and homeostasis, mitochondrial function (MTT assay), membrane permeability (LDH release), inflammation (IL-8), oxidative stress (reduced glutathione, GSH), NLRP3 inflammasome activation (IL-1 beta) and nanoparticle cellular uptake (intracellular iron content) were quantified after a 4-h or 24-h cell exposure to increasing IONP concentrations (0-300 mu g Fe/mL). IONPs coated with a linear molecule, NP10COP@2P, were highly taken up by cells and induced significant dose-dependent IL-8 release, oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In comparison, IONPs coated with dendrons of generation 1 (NP10COP@2PG1) and 2 (NP10COP@2PG2) exhibited better biocompatibility. Effect of the dendritic architecture of the surface coating was investigated in a kinetic experiment involving cell short-term exposure (30 min or 1 h 30) to the two dendronized IONPs. NP10COP@2PG2 disrupted cellular homeostasis (LDH release, IL-1 beta and IL-8 secretion) to a greater extend than NP10COP@2PG1, which makes this last IONP the best candidate as MRI contrast or theranostic agent.

AB The goal of the study was to elaborate an antibacterial silver wound dressing covered by a protective coating that would prevent silver diffusion toward skin without losing its biocide properties. Therefore, non woven poly-ethyleneterephtalate (PET) textiles were pre-treated by two types of polysaccharides - chitosan and cyclodextrin - both crosslinked with citric acid by a pad/dry/cure process. Both types of resulting thermofixed textiles carrying the citrate crosslinks were then impregnated in silver solution followed by a thermal treatment and were finally coated by Layer-by-Layer (L-b-L) deposition of a polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) film consisting of anionic water-soluble poly-cyclodextrin and cationic chitosan. The influence of the process parameters was investigated in terms of silver adsorption capacity, PEM system build-up, silver kinetics of release and antibacterial activity. We demonstrate i) the utility of the intermediate thermal treatment step in the reduction of silver leakage in the polyelectrolyte solutions used in the L-b-L process, ii) that silver adsorption on the preliminary thermofixed layers did not affect the PEM system build-up, iii) the slowing down of silver release kinetic thanks to the PEM coating, iv) the preservation of the antibacterial activity despite the PEM coating.

AB This study describes the preparation of free films of zein with and without acetylated high amylose maize starch (HAS) and their corresponding coated tablets as a novel approach to colonic drug delivery. We hypothesise that the embedding of a digestible starch component within the inert zein would allow the film to remain intact until the large intestine is reached. Free films of zein alone and starch/zein were prepared and characterized. SEM and AFM images of film surface showed that films were morphologically inhomogeneous, particularly at lower HAS/Zein ratios; however, nanothermal analysis data suggested that these differences in appearance within the same film are not compositional differences. Moreover, FT-IR could detect no molecular interaction between the two polymers. Paracetamol tablets were coated with HAS/Zein aqueous based coatings of different compositions to a TWG of 20%. Drug release from zein alone and 1:5 HAS/Zein coated tablets under upper gastrointestinal conditions (pH 1.2, pH 6.8 with pepsin and pancreatin included) was very similar (for example approximately 12% and 14% of the drug was released, respectively, after 6 h in a sequential in vitro test), suggesting that release in this region is limited and is not influenced by the presence of HAS in the ratio to zein under study. Studies using an in vitro colon model showed that under simulated colonic conditions, the drug release was significantly (p < 0.05) more rapid from 1:5 HAS/Zein, compared to the zein alone coating formulation. These data therefore support the potential use of zein-starch mixed films for colonic targeting purposes.

AB Electrospun nanofibrous dressings present suitable characteristics to be used in wound healing, such as high porosity and high surface area-to-volume ratio. In this study, a wound dressing based on PLGA and Aloe vera containing lipid nanoparticles (NLCs) was developed. NLCs were added in order to add a lipid component that could avoid the adhesion of the dressing to the wound and improve its handling. Membranes with and without NLCs were composed of uniform fibers of about 1 mu m in diameter. Their porosity was above 80% and their thickness was about 160 mu m. Both dressings showed similar water vapour transmission rate 1100 g/m(2) day. The formulation containing NLCs presented a higher ultimate tensile strength (2.61 +/- 0.46 MPa) and a higher water uptake. Both formulations were biocompatible in vitro. Furthermore, the cell adhesion assay demonstrated that both membranes had a low adherence profile, although it was lower with the dressing containing NLCs. Finally, their efficacy was evaluated in a full thickness wound healing assay conducted in db/db mice, where both enhanced healing similarly. Accordingly, the PLGA-AV-NLC membrane might be a promising strategy for the treatment of chronic wounds, since it improved handling in comparison to the formulation without NLCs.

AB Poor bioavailability and low residence time limit the efficiency of conventional biguanide-based eye drops against Acanthamoeba keratitis. The aim of this work was to formulate an original anti-amoebic thermoreversible ocular gel combining biguanide and metalloproteases inhibitor - chelating agent. Chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX)-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (Na(2)EDTA) were compounded in poloxamer 407 saline solution. 0.02% CHX - 0.1% Na(2)EDTA loaded thermosensitive ocular gel exhibited appropriate pH (5.73 +/- 0.06), iso-osmolality (314 +/- 5 mOsm/kg), viscosity (ranged between 15 and 25 mPa.s) and thermal gelation (26.5 degrees C and 33 degrees C) properties. Bioadhesion of gel was successfully tested onto isolated bovine eyes as well as the assessment of CHX penetration into the cornea. Intracorneal CHX concentration was found greater than trophozoite minimum amoebicidal concentration and minimal cysticidal concentration after 15-min and 2-h ocular exposure, respectively, while any CHX permeation through the cornea was detected ( < 51 ng/cm(2)/h). Improvement of CHX ocular bioavailability was attributed to probable solubilization of tear film lipid layer by poloxamer. In vitro efficiency of CHX-Na(2)EDTA ocular gel was confirmed from the drastic reduction of trophozoite and cyst survival (to 25% and 2%, respectively), confirming the potential of the multicomponent pharmaceutical material strategy for the treatment of Acanthamoeba keratitis.

AB Controlled drug-delivery systems have potential as substitutes for traditional medication systems due to the advantages in safety, efficacy, and patient compliance that these long-acting dosage forms provide. In this context, the present study focus on the development of self-implanted hyaluronic acid (HA) tiny needles that encapsulate ivermectin (IVM)-poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles for controlled transdermal IVM release to treat parasitic diseases. The fabricated tiny needles involved matching portable applicator have potentially able for self-administration by patients without intense pain or complexity of current controlled-release devices. The biodegradable IVM-loaded PLGA microparticles were prepared and encapsulated within the tip of dissolving HA tiny needles to achieve high delivery efficiency. The drug loading of tiny needles might be controlled by varying the repeat time of filling or pressing processes. In-vitro tests showed that the tiny needles have sufficient mechanical strength to be inserted into skin within seconds and, next rapidly dissolved to release the loaded drug carriers into subcutaneous tissues for intradermal sustained IVM release. With the in-vivo test in rats, the insertion site recovered barrier property within 3 h. In comparison to traditional hypodermic injection or implantation of controlled-release systems, the proposed polymer tiny needles can be considered as a promising device for controlled transdermal drug delivery.

AB Nowadays twin-screw granulation has been emerging as an attractive continuous wet granulation technique. This study was geared towards better process design and understanding with emphasis on bridging the knowledge gap between input and output variables by employing sequential experimentation strategy. A low-dose formulation for granulation experiments contained anhydrous caffeine as the model drug. In the first phase of parameter screening, D-optimal design and stepwise regression were leveraged to develop interaction models following the examination of various quantitative and qualitative factors of potential importance. To maximize the design space dictated by predefined quality target values, several variables were fixed at optimum levels: 700 rpm screw speed, 60 degrees kneading element staggering angle, 5 kneading elements and distributive feed screw in the screw configuration. In the second phase of characterization, response surface design was utilized to investigate the dependence of critical quality attributes of granules and tablets on selected critical process parameters (L/S ratio, throughput and barrel temperature). The results indicated that the influence of throughput and barrel temperature was relatively inferior to L/S ratio. Higher degree of liquid saturation led to granules with narrower size distribution, smaller porosity and enhanced flowability and tablets with declining tensile strength yet slackened drug release.

AB Controlled release of hydrophilic drugs from carriers is still faced with problems due to the poor compatibility of such substances with slowly degradable polymers leading to challenges regarding fabrication as well as undesired burst release of the encapsulated drugs. In this context, coaxial electrospinning being capable of simultaneously using two different solvent systems provides a promising strategy. However, the coaxial electrospinning process is extremely complex and numerous parameters might impact the incorporation as well as release kinetics of the drugs. To address this gap, we fabricated coaxial fibers for controlled co-delivery of two different drugs: bovine serum albumin as a model protein and acyclovir as a small molecule. Controlled release of both embedded drugs was achieved, and drug release profiles could be modulated through modifying spinning techniques as well as compositions and process parameters of the core fluid. Especially, the interactions of the co-incorporated drugs were found to be of key significance for affecting drug distribution within the fibers, and thus ultimately impacting drug release kinetics. Based on our findings, key factors for influencing drug encapsulation and release kinetics from coaxial fibers could be identified, providing a valuable guidance for rational development of coaxial fiber-based drug carriers.

AB Polymers functionally contribute to supersaturation and precipitation inhibition of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in amorphous solid dispersions (ASD). Therefore, it is necessary to monitor physicochemical changes of the polymeric carrier caused by the manufacturing process. This is especially important when the material is exposed to heat and shear stress as in case of hot-melt extrusion (HME). This study evaluated the impact of HME process conditions on physical characteristics of poly(vinylpyrrolidone-co-vinyl-acetate) 60:40 (PVP-VA64) which is a widely used polymer for HME. Focus was set on molecular weight (M-w) and polydispersity index (PDI), by means of absolute molar mass detection via multi-angle light scattering. The generation of a high M-w fraction together with a decrease of the average M-w was detected. In a next step, the influence of these changes on the dissolution behavior of ASD was evaluated. Different stress conditions were applied onto PVP-VA64 in placebo extrusions. The obtained stressed polymer samples were subsequently used to prepare verum ASD with ketoconazole by spray drying (SD). SD dispersions (SDD) of thermally stressed PVPVA64 were compared to SDD prepared with bulk powder. Although there were only slight changes in M-w and PDI, they significantly impacted supersaturation and precipitation of the formulation.

AB The mechanism of colloidal silica action to improve flow properties of pharmaceutical powders is known to be based on inter-particle force disruption by silica particles adhered to the particle surface. In the present article, the kinetic aspects of this action are investigated, focusing on non-spherical particles of different size. Blends comprising microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate and colloidal silica were examined using powder rheometer. The blends were formulated to represent effects of particle size, surface texture, colloidal silica loading, and mixing time. Pre-conditioning, shear testing, compressibility, and flow energy measurements were used to monitor flow properties. Components and blends were analyzed using particle size analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and back-scattered electron (BSE) detection to determine surface particle arrangement. All studied parameters were found to have substantial effects on flow properties of powder blends. Those effects were explained by identifying key steps of colloidal silica action, which were found to proceed at substantially different rates, causing the flow properties change over time being dependent on the blend formulation and the component properties.

AB Residual virulence is a major drawback in current Brucella vaccines. Live vaccines induce abortions in pregnant animals. Hence, a novel anti-Brucella vaccine was developed utilizing rough Salmonella delivering four Brucella antigens. Safety implications during pregnancy, humoral immune responses, and protective efficacy against wild type Brucella was investigated in guinea pig model. The vaccine did not induce abortions or severe complications in pregnant guinea pigs when administered 4 x 10(8) CFU via intraperitoneal route. Systemic IgG determination against antigen components reveals induction of immunity via the Salmonella delivery. Protection efficacy against abortions was 33.3% (2/6) when midterm sow challenged with virulent Brucella 544 strain while none was protected in control group. Lower Brucella recovery in spleen and liver and reduced histopathological burden were also noticed. Although abortion induced by Brucella challenge was not completely prevented, the vaccine candidate may perform better with optimization of vaccination such as inoculation dose optimization.

AB The New Zealand White rabbit is a highly accessible animal model which is regularly employed in biomedical research. However, the paucity of rabbit-specific reagents available limits its use in certain fields. Specifically, the lack of a reliable T cell assay has limited its employment in immune prophylactic and therapeutic studies. To address this inadequacy, we have developed an ELISpot assay to detect cellular immune responses (IFN-gamma production) after antigenic stimulation. We have applied this assay to model the T cell responses elicited by a DNA vaccine. Immunization with an influenza nucleoprotein (NP) DNA vaccine revealed strong antigen-specific T cell responses in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell population. We believe this is the first report of such an assay in rabbit species, and it will become a useful tool to monitor in vivo responses to vaccines and permit the wider adoption of this model to measure immunological responses.

AB Feral swine cost around $1.5 billion each year in agricultural, environmental, and personal property damages. They are also the most widespread carriers of the zoonotic disease brucellosis, which threatens both livestock bio-security and public health. Currently, there is no approved vaccine against brucellosis in pigs. This is a preliminary report on the development of a live-attenuated B. suis vaccine that could be employed to deliver heterologous antigens to control swine populations. An attenuated vaccine strain provided significant protection against B. suis challenge in mice. Leucine auxotrophy in the vaccine strain allowed the over-expression of heterologous antigens without the use of antibiotic resistant markers. Vaccinated mice showed the development of antibodies against expressed antigen. Further evaluation is required to assess its ability to cause infertility using the mouse model prior to further testing for use as a tool for feral swine population and disease control.

SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Influenza; Vaccination; Policy
AB In Italy, several types of influenza vaccine are on the market. Available evidence suggests that no single vaccine type is universally appropriate; rather, different types may be more appropriate for different population strata. However, while the concept of appropriateness/preferential use of single vaccines is usually adopted at the central level, little is known about the attitudes of physicians on the matter. A pilot survey of Italian physicians (N = 372) revealed that most (about 90%) were aware that the available vaccines were different, and that particular vaccines were more appropriate for specific groups. The availability of explicit guidelines on which vaccine to administer to a given population group was deemed desirable by 93.2% of respondents. The results were consistent with the 2018 Italian and UK normative documents, which indicate adjuvanted vaccines as the most appropriate choice for the elderly, and quadrivalent formulations for the younger age-classes. Public health policy implications are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of an influenza vaccination in patients with myasthenia gravis with acetylcholine receptor antibodies (AChR MG).
   Methods: An influenza vaccination or placebo was administered to 47 AChR MG patients. Before and 4 weeks after administration blood samples and clinical outcome scores were obtained. Antibodies to the vaccine strains A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09, A/Hong Kong/4801/14 (H3N2) and B/Brisbane/060/08 were measured using the hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay and disease-specific AChR antibody titers were measured with a radio-immunoprecipitation assay. Forty-seven healthy controls (HC) were vaccinated with the same influenza vaccine to compare antibody titers.
   Results: A post-vaccination, seroprotective titer (HI >= 1:40) was achieved in 89.4% of MG patients vs. 93.6% in healthy controls for the H3N2 strain, 95.7% vs 97.9% for the H1N1 strain and 46.8 vs 51% for the B-strain. A seroprotective titer for all three strains of the seasonal influenza vaccine was reached in 40.4% (19/47) of the MG group and in 51% (24/47) of the HC group. Immunosuppressive medication did not significantly influence post geomean titers (GMT). The titers of disease-specific AChR antibodies were unchanged 4 weeks after vaccination. The clinical outcome scores showed no exacerbation of MG symptoms.
   Conclusion: The antibody response to an influenza vaccination in patients with AChR MG was not different from that in healthy subjects, even in AChR MG patients using immunosuppressive medication. Influenza vaccination does not induce an immunological or clinical exacerbation of AChR MG.

AB Tumor cells/dendritic cells (DCs) fusion cells (tumor/DC) represent a promising immunotherapeutic strategy but are still under performed in clinical trials for cancer treatment. To further boost their anticancer efficacy, here we developed a novel design for fusing dendritic cells with MDA-MB-231 cells expressing the heterologous alpha-galactose (alpha-gal) epitope and assessed its anticancer activities both in vitro and in vivo. The high expression of alpha-gal in MDA-MB-231 (Gal(+)/DC correlated with enhanced DC activation. When applied to T cells, MDA-MB-231 (Gal(+)/DC significantly stimulated T-cell proliferation and activation, promoted productions of cytokines IL-2 and IFN-gamma, and enhanced T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 cells. MDA-MB-231 (Gal(+)/DC inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of tumor cells in vivo, prolonged mouse survival, and significantly boosted anticancer immunity by increasing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells systemically and elevating serum levels of cytokines and IgG. These results suggested that fusing dendritic cells with tumor cells expressing the heterologous alpha-gal epitope provides a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Neospora caninum is an intracellular protozoan parasite closely related to Toxoplasma gondii. N. caninum is thought to be a major cause of abortion in cattle worldwide. Given the current situation of drastic economic losses and a lack of efficient control strategies against such parasites, the challenge to develop potent vaccine candidates and technologies remains. We investigated the immune stimulating activity of N. caninum cyclophilin (NcCyp) with and without a formulation with oligomannose-coated-liposomes (OML) as the potential adjuvant. NcCyp-OML activated NF-kappa B in RAW 264.7 cells and triggered interleukin (IL)-12p40 production from murine peritoneal macrophages. In BALB/c mice, immunization with NcCyp-OML was associated with the production of specific antibodies (IgGI and IgG2a). The specific antibody (IgG1) against naked NcCyp was also observed after the challenge infection, but it was significantly lower than those of NcCyp-OML. Moreover, significant cellular immune responses were induced, including spleen cell proliferation and interferon-gamma production. The immunization of mice with NcCyp-OML, and to lesser extent with naked NcCyp, induced significant protection against challenge with a lethal dose of N. caninum compared with the PBS control group. This protection was associated with a higher survival rate, slight changes in body weight, and lower clinical score of mice. In addition, the significant protective efficacy of NcCyp-OML was confirmed in another mouse strain, male C57BL/6 mice. The current study revealed the marked contribution of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) to the protective immunity triggered by NcCyp-OML because higher numbers of TLR2(-/-) mice succumbed to a lethal dose of N. caninum compared with C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, prominent spleen cell proliferation and IFN-gamma production was induced in NcCyp-OML-immunized mice by a TLR2-dependent mechanism. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The study examined factors that affect parental intention-to-vaccinate adolescent daughters with HPV vaccine in Mysore district, India. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1609 parents of adolescent girls attending schools in Mysore District between February 2010 and October 2011. A validated questionnaire was used to assess parental attitudes, beliefs related with HPV infection, cervical cancer, HPV vaccine and vaccination in general. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate parameters and assess whether a model based on the integrative behavior theory would fit the current data. More than two-thirds (78.0%) of parents would accept vaccinating their daughters with HPV vaccine. Intention to HPV vaccination significantly increased with increase in the perception of parents about the benefits (standardized regression coefficient (beta) = 0.39) or sources of information about HPV vaccine (beta = 0.24), but intention decreased significantly with an increase in the perception about barriers to HPV vaccination beta = -0.44). The effect of beliefs about severity of HPV infection or cervical cancer (beta = 0.20), and beliefs about benefits (beta = 0.20) or barriers (beta = -0.25) to vaccination in general on intention to HPV vaccination were significantly mediated by parental attitudes and source of information about the vaccine. Geographical location significantly moderated the awareness about HPV on beliefs about severity of HPV infection or cervical cancer (beta = 0.33), and the effect of religion on norms related to HPV vaccination (beta = 0.19). Fit of the model to the data was acceptable. This study identified modifiable parental attitudes about HPV vaccine and beliefs related with HPV infection, cervical cancer and vaccination, which predicted parental intention-to-vaccinate their daughters with HPV vaccine in India. Health education interventions tailored to counter parental negative attitudes and beliefs about HPV vaccine and vaccination in general would be important for the community to promote HPV vaccination.

AB Neisseria meningitidis caused meningitis is life-threatening acute infection with high fatality and high frequency of severe sequelae. Meningococcal capsular polysaccharides can be used to prevent meningococcal disease; while conjugating the polysaccharides to carrier protein was found necessary to improve the immunogenicity and induce memory responses in infants and young children. Nevertheless, repeated administration of glycoconjugate vaccines might lead to carrier-induced epitope suppression due to limited number of carrier proteins. Here in this study, full-length hepatitis B core antigen virus-like particles (HBc VLPs) was used as a novel potential carrier protein for conjugation of meningococcal group C polysaccharides (CPS) with heterobifunctional polyethylene glycol (PEG) of different length (2, 5 and 10 kDa) as linkers. The physiochemical properties of the CPS-PEG-HBc conjugate vaccines were fully characterized. The TEM, DLS, native agarose gel electrophoresis, and HPLC analyses all confirmed the successful conjugation. As compared to plain CPS and the physical mixture of CPS and HBc, the immunization with the conjugate vaccines can generate about 10 times increase in CPS specific IgG titers with a significant boosting effect. HBc conjugation induced a shift to a Th1 cellular immune type response, as assessed by the increased IgG2a subclass production. In addition, vaccination of the conjugate vaccines elicited much enhanced avidity functional antibody and long-lasting immunological memory. IgG titers elicited by CPS-P2k-HBc, CPS-P5k-HBc and CPS-PlOk-HBc at week 18 maintained 38.1%, 17.9% and 33.3% of their peak values. All these results demonstrated that HBc VLPs can be used as potential carrier protein to develop polysaccharide conjugate vaccines effective in eliciting long-lasting and strong cellular immune response.

AB The changes in the recommended storage conditions of the glycoconjugate vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis (Men) serogroup A and serogroup X can affect its activity or potency. Elevated temperature and the change in pH may result in the physical instability leading to the size degradation of the polysaccharide (PS) and subsequent loss of PS epitopes. Moreover, high temperature may also result in protein aggregation and altered tertiary structure of the protein in the conjugate. Consequently, the construction of a potent glycoconjugate is dependent on optimal temperature and pH. The changes in both these conditions can also affect the production of a capsular polysaccharide (PS) and its conjugation to a protein carrier and may also affect the integrity of the vaccine molecule including the maintenance of the protective epitopes. In our study we have used inhibition ELISA as a tool to assess the impact of temperature and pH alterations on the antigenicity of N. meningitidis serogroup A and X, PS and conjugates and their correlation with the size distribution analysis using high pressure size exclusion chromatography. The studies on pH alterations from 5 to 9 led to minimal impact on size and antigenicity of all antigens, however, an elevated temperature adversely impacted the antigen size as well as antigenicity to varying extent. Results indicate the higher stability of MenX PS and conjugate as compared to that for MenA counterparts at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, both the MenA and MenX conjugates appears to be more stable as compared to the corresponding PSs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV), an OIE listed viral pathogen, is the etiological agent of a contagious disease, causing huge economic losses in farmed olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) and significant mortalities among several other marine fish species in Korea, Japan, and China. In continuation with our previous work, where injection vaccination with inactivated VHSV mixed with squalene (as adjuvant) conferred higher protective immunity to olive flounder, the present study focused on replacing the injection route of vaccine delivery by immersion/oral route to overcome the limitations of the par enteral immunization method. Here, we encapsulated the inactivated VHSV vaccine with PLGA (poly lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PNPs-IV) and evaluated its ability to induce protective immunity in olive flounder (12.5 +/- 1.5 g) by initially immunizing the fishes by immersion route followed by a booster with the same dose two weeks later with half of the fish through immersion route and other half through oral route (incorporated into fish feed). Cumulative mortalities post-challenge (1 x 10(6) TCID50 virus/fish) with virulent VHSV-isolate, were lower in vaccinated fish and RPS of 60% and 73.3% were obtained for PNPs-IV (immersion/immersion) and PNPs-IV (immersion/oral) groups, respectively. In addition, specific (anti-VHSV) antibody titre in the fish sera, skin mucus and intestinal mucus of the immunized groups were significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced following vaccination. Furthermore, PNPs-IV immunized fish showed significant (p < 0.05) upregulation of different immune gene transcripts (IgM, IgT, plgR, MHC-I, MHC-II, IFN-gamma, and Caspase3) compared to controls, in both the systemic (kidney) and mucosal (skin and intestine) immune compartment of the host post immunization as well as post challenge. Thus it can be inferred that the adopted immunization strategy efficiently protected and transported the inactivated viral antigen to target immune organs and positively stimulated the protective immune response against VHSV in olive flounder.

AB Background: The aims of the study are to evaluate attitudes about childhood vaccines and vaccine refusal or delay among parents and to assess the role played by the variables mapped as potential determinants to suggest strategies that could improve childhood vaccination rates.
   Methods: The cross-sectional study was intended for parents of kindergarteners. Parental attitudes were measured using the Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines (PACV) survey, to screen for Vaccine Hesitancy (VH). In addition, selected factors have been grouped in three categories (contextual, individual and group and vaccine/vaccination-specific influences), and were explored as potential determinant of VH and vaccination refusal or delay.
   Results: 7.7% of subjects were defined as VH parents (VHPs) through PACV score, while 24.6% reported having refused or delayed at least one dose of vaccine for their child. VH was more common in those parents that decided not to vaccinate their child after having received information from mass-media, in those who did not agree with mandatory vaccinations, and in those who agreed with political leaders who oppose to vaccination. Vaccine refusing/delaying parents were more frequently those who agreed that infant vaccinations are primarily an economic business of pharmaceutical companies, and who disagreed that access to the kindergarten should only be allowed to children who had been vaccinated.
   Conclusion: The findings of the present study emphasize the importance of PACV as a tool to screen VHPs. Furthermore, results highlight important potential determinants of VH, such as communication and media environment, and attitudes about prevention. Health care providers could act as key components to improve the public trust to scientific and epidemiological evidence. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The Meningococcal Antigen Typing System (MATS) was developed to identify meningococcus group B strains with a high likelihood of being covered by the 4CMenB vaccine, but is limited by the requirement for viable isolates from culture-confirmed cases. We examined if antigen genotyping could complement MATS in predicting strain coverage by the 4CMenB vaccine.
   Methods: From a panel of 3912 MATS-typed invasive meningococcal disease isolates collected in England and Wales in 2007-2008, 2014-2015 and 2015-2016, and in 16 other countries in 2000-2015, 3481 isolates were also characterized by antigen genotyping. Individual associations between antigen genotypes and MATS coverage for each 4CMenB component were used to define a genetic MATS (gMATS). gMATS estimates were compared with England and Wales human complement serum bactericidal assay (hSBA) data and vaccine effectiveness (VE) data from England.
   Results: Overall, 81% of the strain panel had genetically predictable MATS coverage, with 92% accuracy and highly concordant results across national panels (Lin's accuracy coefficient, 0.98; root-mean square deviation, 6%). England and Wales strain coverage estimates were 72-73% by genotyping (66-73% by MATS), underestimating hSBA values after four vaccine doses (88%) and VE after two doses (83%). The gMATS predicted strain coverage in other countries was 58-88%.
   Conclusions: gMATS can replace MATS in predicting 4CMenB strain coverage in four out of five cases, without requiring a cultivable isolate, and is open to further improvement. Both methods underestimated VE in England. Strain coverage predictions in other countries matched or exceeded England and Wales estimates. (C) 2019 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA.

AB We used a combination of DOP-PCR with high throughput sequencing (HTS) to study infected cell cultures over time to assess the feasibility of using this technique to provide a read-out other than cytopathic effect in cell culture infectivity assays. Because DOP-PCR primers feature a short constant sequence at their 3' terminus, the procedure yields a reproducible representational library of products from a given PCR template, including viral nucleic acids. Using SV40- and MVM-infected cultures harvested at different times, we show that the number of viral matches among DOP-PCR products parallels the quantity of virus as shown by real-time PCR, and further show that HTS analysis of specific DOP-PCR products that increase in quantity over time could be used to identify the infecting virus with a sensitivity similar to that of typical cell-culture assays that rely on cytopathic effect.

AB Kinesins are essential for the transport and positioning of several biomolecules through moving along the microtubule in eukaryotic cells. Up to now, there are 14 kinesin family proteins known. The MAPK pathway which is composed of multiple proteins constituting a complex cascade also plays important roles in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in eukaryotic cells. MAPK pathway includes three main kinases: MAPK Kinase Kinase, MAPK Kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase that activate and phosphorylate downstream step by step in which abundant proteins scaffold together in complex ways. To accomplish the transmission of a variety of signals, numbers of kinesins are closely associated with the MAPK cascade such as Kinesin-1, Kinesin-3, Kinesin-5, Kinesin-8, Kinesin-11 and Kinesin-13 families in mammals and two kinds of kinesin-like proteins in plants. Studies have indicated that Kinesin-1 light chain KLC1, Kinesin-1 heavy chain KIF5B and Kinesin-11 family motor KIF26B interact with extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK closely to regulate neuronal differentiation and mediate the chemosensitivity of osteosarcoma cells to drugs, Kinesin-3 family motor KIF13B and Kinesin-5 family motor Eg5 perform functions in regulating p38 to regulate the myelination of nervous system and facilitate the spindle elongation and tension, Kinesin-8 family motor MS-KIF18A and three isoforms of kinesin-13 can also connect and interact with MAPK pathway to transport estrogen receptor to the nucleus and control cell migration. In plant cells, NPK1-activating kinesin-like protein 1 NACK and AtNACK1 (HIK) kinesinlike protein HINKEL are two members of the plant-specific kinesin-7. They function as Ras at the upstream of MAPK pathway to regulate cytokinesis. This review summarizes the novel roles of kinesins in MAPK cascade and tries to discuss the mechanism of the interaction between them using mammalian and plant cells as models.

AB Smallish (Smash), the Drosophila homologue of human LIM domain only 7 (LMO7), is a key regulator of Drosophila embryogenesis associated with planner cell polarity and actomyosin contractility at the zonula adherence. Although smash mRNA is expressed in several tissues during Drosophila development, only Smash function at the adherence junction in the embryonic epithelial cells has been reported. We herein demonstrated that the knockdown of smash in eye imaginal discs induced morphological aberrations in adult compound eyes that were associated with increased apoptosis. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analyses revealed that Smash localized to the nucleus in several tissues, including eye imaginal discs. The knockdown of smash in eye imaginal discs down-regulated the expression of the ote and hocks genes as well as the Drosophila homologue of the emeriti gene, which is a target of LMO7. Collectively, these results indicate that Smash functions in proper Drosophila eye development mediated by the regulation of ote and bocks gene expression.

AB Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) superfamily exerts crucial roles in the regulation of intracellular metabolism, gene expression as well as integral activities in diverse cellular processes. In our study, 14 mapk genes were identified in spotted sea bass (Lateolabrax maculatus) and these genes were divided into three subfamilies according to phylogenetic analysis, including 6 erk genes, 3 jnk genes and 5 p38-mapk genes. Syntenic and tertiary structure analysis confirmed their annotation and orthologies. The expression profiles of several stress-responsive mapk genes of spotted sea bass were examined in gill using quantitative real-time PCR after salinity (0 parts per thousand, 12 parts per thousand, 30 parts per thousand, 45 parts per thousand) and hypoxia challenges (DO = 1.0 +/- 0.2 mg/L). After salinity challenge, significant up-regulations were observed in the expressions of mapk8 (jnkl), mapk9 (jnk2), mapk11 (p3813), mapkl4a (p38a) and mapkl4b (p38b). mapk8 and mapk9 were more sensitive to hypotonic challenge (0 parts per thousand) than hyperosmotic (45 parts per thousand) and isosmotic challenges (12 parts per thousand), while the highest expression of mapk11, mapkl4a and mapkl4b were observed in hyperosmotic challenge (45 parts per thousand). After hypoxia challenge, the expression levels of mapkl (erk2), mapk3 (erkl) and mapkl4a (p38a) in treatment group (DO = 1.0 +/- 0.2 mg/L) were significantly up-regulated in comparison with control group (DO = 8.0 +/- 0.5 mg/L) in time-dependent manner. These results indicated that these mapk genes in spotted sea bass may play important roles in response to salinity and hypoxia challenges.

AB Anti-proliferative, anti-metastatic and anti-angiogenic effects of 17-allylamino-17-demethoxy geldanamycin (17AAG) were studied alone and in combination with Capecitabine (Cap) and/or Irinotecan (IR) on HT-29 human colorectal carcinoma cells. Expression of MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase-9) and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) mRNA was analyzed by real-time PCR method. The study was further followed by wound scratch assay for migration assessment. Nitric oxide content, Malondialdehyde generation and total anti-oxidant capacity were also assessed. Results showed significant differences between mono- and double therapy (p < 0.05). Combination of 17-AAG with IR or Cap resulted in synergistic effect (Combination Index < 1). Among double combination groups only Cap/17-AAG showed significant differences in MMP-9 and VEGF genes expression and wound healing assay. Moreover, a significant decrease of wound area in our triple combination group was obtained, indicating the antagonistic effect. IR/17-AAG and IR/Cap double combination groups resulted in down-regulation of MMP-9 and VEGF mRNA expression, respectively. Significant generation of MDA and decrease in TAC values have been observed in all our tested groups, however, the IR/17-AAG combination was the only group that could elevate NO concentration, significantly. Our findings demonstrated potent anti-angiogenesis and anti-metastatic effects for 17-AAG when it is provided in double combination especially with Cap, suggesting a new protocol in colorectal cancer combination therapy. These findings may indicate that down regulation of VEGF and MMP-9 genes is directly related to angiogenesis and metastasis.

AB Sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) belongs to the mitochondrial sirtuin family, which constitutes a highly conserved family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD-dependent deacetylases and ADP-ribosyltransferases that play important regulatory roles in stress resistance and metabolic homeostasis. SIRT5 was shown to have deacetylase, desuccinylase, and demalonylase activities. However, the mechanisms regulating SIRT5 transcription remain unclear. To explore the molecular regulation of bovine SIRT5 expression, we obtained a 500-base pair fragment of the 5'-regulatory region of bovine SIRT5 by molecular cloning, which contained a region with 3 CpG islands. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and luciferase reporter assays revealed the E2F transcription factor 4 (E2F4) and Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) binding sites as transcriptional activators or repressors in the promoter region of SIRT5. We further verified that E2F4 and KLF6 bind to the SIRT5 promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Additionally, methylation and luciferase report assays showed that SIRT5 promoter activity was enhanced by demethylation, and transcriptional activation by E2F4 and transcriptional inhibition by KLF6 of SIRT5 expression was strengthened by demethylation during adipocytes differentiation. This study focused on the mechanism underlying the methylation and transcriptional regulation of SIRT5 expression in bovine adipocytes.

AB Ikaros, encoded by IKZF1 (Ikaros family zinc finger 1), is an important transcription factor in the control of lymphocyte specification and differentiation. Multiple functions of Ikaros have been exerted in almost all hematopoietic cell types, from stem cells to mature lymphoid and myeloid cells. Moreover, nonhematopoietic cells are also functional targets of Ikaros. Ikaros is essential for normal hematopoiesis, autoimmune and tumor suppression. Ikaros mutations were associated with lymphoblastic cells deficiency, autoimmunity and malignancies development, including hematological malignancies (leukemia) and solid tumors. This review focus on discuss the role of Ikaros in hematological malignancies, solid tumors and autoimmune diseases, and highlight the importance of Ikaros in cancer and immune diseases therapy.

AB The mitochondrial DNA gene cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) has been adopted as a global bioidentification system for animals. This study represents the comprehensive molecular identification of small indigenous fish species (SIS) of Bangladesh assessed by DNA barcoding. DNA barcodes were generated from 81 SIS species belongs to the orders Clupeiformes, Cypriniforms, Siluriformes, Perciformes, Synbranchiformes, Beloniformes and Tetraodontiformes representing 55 genera and 24 families. For all the samples, %G were significantly lowered compared to other nucleotides and %GC compared to %AT. Also, a significantly lowered GC content was observed in second and third codon position compared to the first codon position in all samples. The average Kimura two-parameter (K2P) distances within genera, families, and orders were 15.83%, 19.14%, and 25.07%, respectively. The minimum and maximum K2P distance based genetic divergences were 0.19% and 57.14% respectively. Members of Cypriniformes, Siluriformes, and Perciformes were clustered separately in the neighbour -joining (NJ) tree. Nucleotide composition, GC distribution across codon positions, K2P distance, genetic divergence, and phylogenetic analyses reveal that these freshwater SIS fishes are genetically very diverse. Along with morphological data, we have confirmed the existence of seven new records of SIS fishes in Bangladesh using such barcode approach. These findings suggest that fishes can be discriminated using these barcode data without any confusion.

AB In the phylum of Proteobacteria, quorum sensing (QS) system is widely driven by synthesis and response of N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) signalling molecules. AHL is synthesized by LuxI homologue and sensed by LuxR homologue. Once the AHL concentration achieves a threshold level, it triggers the regulation of target genes. In this study, QS activity of Citrobacter amalonaticus strain YG6 which was isolated from clams was investigated. In order to characterise luxUR homologues, the genome of C. amalonaticus strain YG6 (4.95 Mbp in size) was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq sequencer. Through in silico analysis, a pair of canonical luxl/R homologues and an orphan luxR homologue were identified and designated as caml, carnR, and camR2, respectively. A putative lux box was identified at the upstream of caml. The car& gene was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS. High-resolution triple quadrupole liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis verified that the Caml is a functional AHL synthase which produced multiple AHL species, namely N-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL), N-hexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C6-HSL), N-octanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C8-HSL), N-tetradecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C14-HSL) and N-hexadecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C16-HSL) in C. amalonaticus strain YG6 and carol gene in recombinant E. colt BL21(DE3)pLysS. To our best knowledge, this is the first functional study report of cams as well as the first report describing the production of C14-HSL by C. amalonaticus.

AB The human genome contains an unusually large number of processed pseudogenes. The fact that processed pseudogenes are roughly 33% more abundant in our X chromosome than in our autosomes suggests that this overabundance is the result of the fact that human oogenesis is much longer than that of non-mammalian species. Here, we analyze the origins of the processed pseudogenes found on the human Y chromosome to determine whether human spermatogenesis also contribute to this overabundance.
   Our results show that human processed pseudogenes not only retrotranspose to the Y chromosome, but are also produced by genes on the Y chromosome. Furthermore, the fact that X chromosomes are three times more abundant than Y chromosomes likely explains why the euchromatic density of processed pseudogenes is three times higher in the X chromosome than in the Y chromosome.
   The large number of processed pseudogenes found in our genome is therefore due to the low substrate specificity of the Ll reverse transcriptase responsible for the reverse transcription of germline mRNA molecules into processed pseudogenes, as well as the life-long production of both male and female gametes.

AB Background and purposes: Stroke is a leading cause of death and serious disability worldwide. Now, evidences indicate that dyslipidemia may play an important role in stroke. APOA1 and APOA5 involve in lipid metabolism. In this study, we investigated the association of APOA1 rs670 and APOA5 rs662799 with different stroke subtypes in the Han Chinese population of Taiwan.
   Methods: A total of 1751 participants, including 459 control subjects, 606 large artery atherosclerosis (LAA), 339 small vessel occlusion (SVO), and 347 hypertensive intracranial hemorrhage (HICH), were enrolled. The presence of rs670 and rs662799 was analyzed through polymerase chain react ion and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
   Results: Notably, the frequency of the rs662799 C allele was significantly lower in the SVO patients than in the controls (24.36% vs. 29.74%, P = 0.024). The frequencies of heterozygote TC [odd ratio (OR) = 0.732, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.544-0.984, P = 0.038] and TC + CC (OR = 0.719, 95% CI = 0.542-0.953, P = 0.022) genotypes were significantly lower in the SVO patients than in the controls. In addition, triglyceride levels in individuals carrying the rs662799 TC + CC genotype were significantly higher than in those carrying the TT genotype, especially in older age, female, and body mass index (BMI) 25 groups. On the contrary, the low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) was significantly lower in rs662799 TC + CC genotype than TI' genotype. The BMI was significantly lower in subjects with rs662799 TC + CC genotype than those with TI' genotype, especially in older age and female. High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were higher in individuals carrying the rs670 GG genotype than in those carrying the AG + AA genotype, especially in BMI < 25 group. Logistic regression analysis showed that the rs662799 C allele (TC + CC) was an independent protective factor for SVO after adjustment for conventional risk factors (OR = 0.709, 95% CI = 0.526-0.956; P = 0.024).
   Conclusion: GG genotype of rs670 is correlated with high serum HDL-C levels, whereas TC + CC genotype of rs662799 is associated with high serum triglyceride and low LDL and BMI levels. In addition, the rs662799 C allele (TC + CC) is an independent protective factor for SVO in the Han Chinese population in Taiwan.

AB Although rye is one of the most cold-tolerant species among temperate cereals, its huge and complex genome has prevented us from identifying agronomically useful genes. However, advances in high-throughput sequencing technology are making it increasingly possible to investigate its genome. The C-repeat binding factor (CBF) gene family controls cold tolerance in plants and its members are well conserved among eudicots and monocots, among which there are diverse homologs. Despite its large genome, only a small number of CBF genes have been identified in rye. In this study, we explored high-throughput sequencing data of the rye genome and identified 12 novel CBF genes. Sequence analyses revealed that these genes contain signature sequences of the CBF family. Chromosomal localization of the genes by PCR using wheat-rye addition lines showed that most of these are located on the long arm of chromosome 5, but also on the long arm of chromosomes 2 and 6. On the basis of comparative analyses of CBF family members in the Triticeae, CBF proteins were divided into several groups according to phylogenetic relationship and conserved motifs. Light is essential to fully induce CBF gene expression and there is specificity in the response to different types of abiotic stresses in ScCBF genes. The results of our study will assist investigations of CBF genes in the Triticeae and the mechanism of cold tolerance through the CBF-dependent pathway in plants.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive liver tumor containing cancer stem cells (CSCs), which participate in tumor invasion, therapeutic resistance, and tumor relapse leading to poor outcome and limited therapeutic options. Recently, a novel lncRNA, THOR (testis-associated highly conserved oncogenic long non coding RNA), was characterized in human cancers and shown to exhibit an oncogenic role. However, the role of THOR in liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) remains obscure. Herein, we observed high expression of THOR in chemoresistant hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). A remarkable increase of THOR expression in OV6 or EpCAM-positive liver CSCs as well as in CSC-enriched hepatoma spheres. Interference THOR suppressed liver CSC expansion by inhibiting the dedifferentiation of hepatoma cells and decreasing the self-renewal ability of liver CSCs. Mechanistically, we found beta-catenin as the downstream of THOR in HCC cells. The special beta-catenin inhibitor FH535 abolished the discrepancy in liver CSC proportion and the self-renewal capacity between THOR knockdown HCC cells and control cells, which further confirmed that beta-catenin was required in THOR promoted liver CSCs expansion. Moreover, interference THOR hepatoma cells were more sensitive to sorafenib treatment, indicates that HCC patients with low THOR expression may benefit from sorafenib treatment. Collectively, THOR was upregulated in liver CSCs and could promote HCC cells dedifferentiation and liver CSCs expansion by targeting beta-catenin signaling.

AB Immune recognition of molecular patterns from microorganisms or self-altered cells activate effector responses that neutralize and eliminate these potentially harmful agents. In virtually every metazoan group the process is carried out by pattern recognition receptors, typically constituted by immunoglobulin (Ig), leucine rich repeat (LRR), and/or lectin domains. In order to get insights into the ancestral immune recognition repertoire of animals, we have sequenced the transcriptome of bacterially challenged colonies of the model cnidarian Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus using the Illumina platform. Over 116,000 assembled contigs were annotated by sequence similarity, domain architecture, and functionally. From these, a subset of 315 unique transcripts was predicted as the putative immune recognition repertoire of H. symbiolongicarpus. Interestingly, canonical Toll-like receptors (TLR) were not predicted, nor any transmembrane protein with the Toll/interleukine-1 receptor (TIR) domain. Yet, a variety of predicted proteins with transmembrane domains associated with LRR ectodomains were identified, as well as homologs of the key transduction factor NF-kappa B, and its associated regulatory proteins. This also has been documented in Hydra, and suggests that recognition and signaling initiation has been decoupled in the TLR system of hydrozoans. In contrast, both canonical and non-canonical NOD-like receptors were identified in H. symbiolongicarpus, showing a higher diversity than the TLR system and perhaps a wider functional landscape. The collection of Ig-like containing putative immune recognition molecules was diverse, and included at least 26 unique membrane bound predicted proteins and 88 cytoplasmic/secreted predicted molecules. In addition, 25 and 5 transcripts encoding the Ig-like containing allorecognition determinants ALR1 and ALR2, respectively, were identified. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses suggested the presence of various transcriptionally active alr loci, and the action of recombination-based mechanisms diversifying them. Transcripts encoding at least six lectin families with putative roles in immune recognition were found, including 19 unique C-type lectins and 21 unique rhamnose-binding lectins. Other predicted immune recognition receptors included scavenger receptors from three families, lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins, cell-adhesion molecules and thioester-bond containing proteins. This analysis demonstrated that the putative immune recognition repertoire of H. symbiolongicarpus is large and diverse.

ID MACULAR DEGENERATION; RARE VARIANTS; HIGH-RISK; CFI GENE; GWAS
AB Motivation: While large-scale whole genome sequencing is feasible the high costs compel investigators to focus on disease subjects. As a result large sequencing datasets of samples with different diseases are often readily available, but not healthy controls to contrast them with. While it is possible to perform an association study using only diseases, the associations could be driven by a disease acting as a control and not the focal disease.
   Methods: We developed a genotype-on-phenotype reverse regression with a Bayesian spike and slab prior to enable association testing in datasets with multiple diseases. This method, referred to as revreg, flagged associations (both common and rare) that were driven by diseases that were not of primary interest.
   Results: Based on simulations, revreg had 80% power to detect an odds ratio of 1.74 for common variants (3500 samples total) and 3.73 for rare variants (14,000 samples total), with minimal type I error. For common variants, we tested this method on 3657 whole genome sequenced samples aimed at discovering variants associated with disease risk of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease using three other diseases as controls. We demonstrated detection of six highly significant associations likely due to Age-Related Macular Degeneration. In an exome dataset of 8836 samples aimed at characterizing rare variants associated with disease risk of Asthma, using five other diseases as controls, we detected and removed genic regions due to AMD (C3, CFH, CFHR5, CFI, and DNMT3A) and RA (KRTAP13-4).

AB High temperature (HT) stress is a major environmental stress that limits agricultural production worldwide. Discovery and application of genes promoting high temperature tolerance is essential to enhance crop tolerance to heat stress. Proteins associated with chaperone and protein folding plays an important role in the high temperature stress response of plants. MTH1745 (MtPDI), a disulfide isomerase-like protein (PDI) with a chaperone function and disulfide isomerase activity from Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus delta H, was selected for studying the heat stress tolerance using an ectopic expression method in rice. Through molecular identification via quantitative real-time PCR and western blot, we demonstrated that the MtPDI gene was expressed stably in transgenic rice. Heat stress tolerance and survival ratio were significantly improved in seedling transgenic rice. At the same time, proline content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities were increased in MtPDI transgenic rice with a reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Moreover, increased content of thiols group was discovered in transgenic plants. These results indicate that heterologous expression of MtPDI from extremophiles could confer heat stress tolerance of transgenic rice through the accumulation of proline content, the synergistic increase of the antioxidant enzymes activity and elevated production of more thiols group, which finally ameliorated the oxidative damage.

AB Objective: To identify the key genes promoting the differentiation of melon non-embryogenic callus into embryogenic callus.
   Methods: The transcriptome sequencing analysis was used to analyze the mRNA sequence in embryogenic callus (Z) and non-embryogenic callus (F); transcript mapping, gene expression analysis, cluster analysis, classification analysis and enrichment analysis were then used to detect the differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways.
   Results: The correlation coefficient between sample Z and sample F was 0.929 after transcript mapping. The overall gene expression levels in sample Z were higher as compared with sample F. Furthermore, cluster analysis showed that the expression of genes involved in photosynthesis was increased in sample Z when comparing to F. Besides, the classification of differential Gene Ontology (GO) showed that many metabolic processes were affected with the metabolism enhanced in embryogenic callus. Interestingly, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis further demonstrated the high metabolic activity and active secondary metabolite formation in the embryogenic callus.
   Conclusion: The genes associated with photosynthesis, metabolic pathways and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites may promote the differentiation of callus into embryogenic callus.

AB Objective: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women. Nowadays, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified and emerged as critical bio-markers in breast cancer tumorigenesis and progression. However, only a handful of lncRNAs which are implicated in BC have been characterized. The underlying molecular mechanisms are still largely unknown.
   Methods: In this study, we explored 12 nominated lncRNAs at breast cancer susceptibility loci identified by genome-wide association studies to contribute to the risk and effects of breast cancer. We then analyzed these lncRNAs in a total of 132 pairs of breast cancer tissues and surrounding non-tumor tissues from southern China population.
   Results: Here, we report a novel lncRNA, LINC01585, is aberrantly down regulated during breast cancer (BC). Next, to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological activity of LINC01585, we identified LINC01585 binding protein by RNA pull-down experiments. Functionally, we found that LINC01585 over expression inhibited breast cancer proliferation and growth by prototypical experiments. Mechanistically, LINC01585 was located in nuclear and binding with NONO protein. Interestingly, when LINC01585 was down expressed, NONO separated from LINC01585 and then interacted with CRTC. The complex promotes CAMP/CREB target gene transcription and thus promotes the growth of breast cancer.
   Conclusions: A series of discoveries suggest to us that LINC01585 has a potential value in anti-carcinoma therapy and deserves further investigation.

AB Pests have been subjected to heavy selection by insecticide pressure, producing greater and more serious resistance. It is extremely valuable to identify the resistance genes that are relevant for pest control. In our previous studies, we reported that UBL40 is the deltamethrin resistance-associated gene. UBL40 is cleaved by specific endopeptidases to release UB and L40. Therefore, further we compared the expression of UB and L40 in different tissues from larvae of the diamondback moth using a deltamethrin-resistant (DR) strain and a deltamethrin-sensitive (DS) strain. The results showed that both UB and L40 knockdown significantly reduced the level of resistance to deltamethrin and clearly decreased the survival rate in P. xylostella after 72 h. These results provide evidence that UB and L40 both play roles in the regulation of deltamethrin resistance, which could help elucidate the resistance mechanisms and identify new target genes associated with deltamethrin resistance in P. xylostella.

   TRENDS
AB Ovarian cancer (OC) is a common disease among Arabs, with one of the highest incidences in the world. OC is underdiagnosed, underreported, and mostly reported with breast cancer. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review to estimate the published knowledge about the genetic epidemiology of OC in the 22 Arab countries. Therefore, we systematically searched seven literature databases (Web of science, PubMed, Science Direct, ProQuest, Embase, Scopus, and Google scholar) from the time of inception until June 2018 to collect all the information related to the incidence and pathogenic mutations spectrum for OC among Arabs. Our search strategy identified 3645 studies, of which 44 studies met our inclusion criteria, which cover the past 25 years (1993-2018). OC incidence among Arabs ranged from a low of 0.9/100,000/year in Saudi Arabia to a high of 8.0/100,000/year in Sudan. The total number of OC patients captured was 802; of these, 53 and five families carry 22 mutations in BRCA1/2 genes. Of these, eight mutations were unique to the Arab populations, and five mutations were commonly circulated among Arabs (BRCA1: c.5266dupC, c.5095C > T, c.68_69delAG, and c.4041_4042delAG; BRCA 2 c.1310_1313delAAGA). The ratio of BRCA1 (77.3%) mutations was higher than BRCA2 mutations (22.7%). This is the first systematic review to focus on the genetic epidemiology of only OC as an understudied disease that is common among Arabs. This study is expected to serve as a platform for further well-controlled genetic epidemiological studies for OC in the Arab world.

AB Pregnant women are highly susceptible to Plasmodium falciparum malaria, leading to substantial maternal, perinatal, and infant mortality. While malaria vaccine development has made significant progress in recent years, no trials of malaria vaccines have ever been conducted in pregnant women. In December 2016, an expert meeting was convened at NIAID, NIH, in Rockville, Maryland to deliberate on the rationale and design of malaria vaccine trials in pregnant women. The discussions highlighted the progress made over recent years in the field of maternal immunization for other infectious diseases, and the evolving regulatory and ethical environment, all of which support a new emphasis on testing malaria vaccines that offer direct benefits to pregnant women. Initial safety and immunogenicity studies of malaria vaccines will be conducted in non-pregnant adult volunteers. Subsequently, efficacy trials involving pregnant women will likely be conducted in malaria-endemic and often resource-poor environments where sufficiently high malaria incidence will allow vaccine activity to be measured. Such trials will need to meet all international standards to ensure the safety of mother and offspring, under oversight of appropriate ethical and regulatory bodies. The convened experts drafted a clinical development plan to test a malaria vaccine product during pregnancy, using as a case study PfSPZ Vaccine being developed by Sanaria Inc. that is currently in phase 2 testing. Following the expert recommendations, a pregnancy registry has been initiated in Ouelessebougou, Mali, to provide baseline information on maternal and fetal outcomes as a context for evaluating PfSPZ Vaccine safety in the future, and new regimens are being assessed that will be suitable for evaluation in pregnant women.

AB Universal vaccination of children against hepatitis A was introduced in 2014 in Brazil as a single-dose schedule. We analyzed the numbers of reported cases of hepatitis A virus infection (HAV) from 2010 to 2017 to evaluate the initial impact of that intervention. Data were assessed and has been freely available on the Brazilian Ministry of Health website. The HAV incidence was steady around 6000 cases per year until 2014. Between 2014 and 2016, there was a 85.5% cumulative drop, independent of gender and geographical macroregions. The fall was especially significant among toddlers (96.8%). In 2017, cases increased due to an outbreak among male adults in Sao Paulo. Decrease in incidence continued to occur for females and for those under 15 years of age. Data show that there was a significant decrease in HAV cases number in Brazil from 2015 after the introduction of single-dose HAV vaccine program. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Leptospirosis is a zoonosis that is responsible for one million human cases per year. Fusing multiple immunogenic antigens represents a promising approach to delivering an effective vaccine against leptospirosis. Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is a potential vaccine vector due to its adjuvant properties and safety. Two chimeric genes based on genic sequences of ligANI, ligBrep, lipL32, and lemA, were individually cloned into five BioBrick vectors with different promoters (pAN, Hsp60, 18 kDa, Ag85B and Ag85B plus signal sequence) for antigen expression in BCG. Groups of ten hamsters were vaccinated with recombinant BCG (rBCG) strains in two doses of 10(6) CFU and challenged with 5 x LD50 of L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni. All rBCG vaccines expressing chimera 1, based on antigens LipL32, LigANI, and LemA, under the control of any promoter, protected 80-100% of the hamsters from challenge (P < 0.05) and four of them also protected from renal carrier status; for chimera 2, based on LigANI and LigBrep antigens, the only vaccine that afforded survival rates statistically different from the control was the vaccine that incorporated the pAN promoter (60% of survival). A single vaccine dose was sufficient to induce significant IgG levels by all vaccine compositions evaluated; however, humoral response was not related to protection. These findings suggest that the combination of potential vaccine candidates in chimeric antigens and the use of BCG as a live vector are promising strategies by which it is possible to obtain an effective and sterilizing vaccine against leptospirosis.

AB Background: We conducted a two-year prospective cohort study to measure the effectiveness of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) to prevent laboratory-confirmed influenza among community-dwelling Thai adults aged >= 65 years during 2015-16 and 2016-17 influenza seasons.
   Methods: In 2015, we enrolled a cohort of 3220 participants. Trained health volunteers collected baseline data and followed participants for two years with weekly surveillance for new or worsened cough with self-collection of nasal swabs. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated as 100% x (1- rate ratio of rRT-PCR-confirmed influenza) among vaccinated versus unvaccinated participants. Propensity score stratification was used to reduce differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants associated with access to and receipt of IIV3.
   Findings: During 2015-16 and 2016-17, 1666 (52%) and 1498 (48%) participants received IIV3, respectively. The overall incidence of influenza during the two seasons was 14.3/1000 person-years among vaccinated participants and 20.2/1000 person-years among unvaccinated participants. VE was -4% (95% confidence interval [CI], -83%-40%) during 2015-16 when there was poor antigenic match between the dominant circulating A/H3N2 viruses and the vaccine strain, and 50% (95% CI, 12-71%) during 2016-17 when circulating and vaccine strains were well-matched. Of all three influenza subtypes in both years, significant protection was observed only against Influenza A/H3N2 during 2016-17 (VE, 49%; 95% CI, 3-73%).
   Interpretation: During a season with well-matched circulating and vaccine strains, IIV3 was moderately effective against laboratory-confirmed influenza among older adults in Thailand. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Adult vaccination; Time-motion; Vaccination; Vaccine counseling
ID UNITED-STATES; INFLUENZA
AB Amid provider reports of financial barriers as an impediment to adult immunization, this study explores the time and costs of vaccination in adult provider practices. Both a Vaccination Time-Motion Study and Vaccine Practice Management Survey were conducted (March - October 2017) in a convenience sample of 19 family medicine (FM), internal medicine (IM), and obstetrician-gynecology (OBGYN) practices, in nine states. Practices were directly observed during a one week period; estimates were collected of time spent on activities that could not be directly observed. Cost estimates were calculated by converting staff time for performed activities. In the time-motion study, FM and IM practices spent similar time conducting vaccination activities (median = 5 min per vaccination), while OBGYN practices spent more time (median = 29 min per vaccination). Combining results from the time-motion study and the practice management survey, the median costs of vaccination remained similar for FM practices and IM practices at $7 and $8 per vaccination, respectively, but was substantially higher for OBGYN practices at $43 per vaccination. Factors that contributed to higher costs among OBGYN practices were the increased time to counsel patients, administer vaccines, and to plan and manage vaccine supplies. In addition, 68% of OBGYN patients who were offered and counseled to receive vaccines declined to receive them. Counseling patients who ultimately do not go on to receive a vaccine may be an important cost factor. Lower costs of vaccination services may be achieved by increasing efficiencies in workflow or the volume of vaccinations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Projected impact, cost-effectiveness, and budget implications of
   rotavirus vaccination in Mongolia

ID DISEASE; VACCINES; BURDEN; MODEL
AB Introduction: Rotavirus disease in Mongolia is estimated to cause more than 50 deaths yearly and many more cases and hospitalizations. Mongolia must self-finance new vaccines and does not automatically access Gavi prices for vaccines. Given the country's limited resources for health, it is critical to assess potential new vaccine programs. This evaluation estimates the impact, cost-effectiveness, and budget implications associated with a nationwide rotavirus vaccine introduction targeting infants as part of the national immunization program in Mongolia, in order to inform decision-making around introduction.
   Methods: The analysis examines the use of the two-dose vaccine ROTARIX (R), and three-dose vaccines ROTAVAC (R) and RotaTeq (R) compared to no vaccination from the government and the societal perspective. We use a modelling approach informed by local data and published literature to analyze the impact and cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination over a ten-year time period starting in 2019, using a 3% discount rate. Our main outcome measure is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as US dollar per DALY averted. We assessed uncertainty around a series of parameters through univariate sensitivity analysis.
   Results: Rotavirus vaccination in Mongolia could avert more than 95,000 rotavirus cases and 271 deaths, over 10 years. Averted visits and hospitalizations represent US$2.4 million in health care costs saved by the government. The vaccination program cost ranges from $6 to $11 million depending on vaccine choice. From the governmental perspective, ICER ranged from $412 to $1050 and from $77 to $715 when considering the societal perspective. Sensitivity analysis highlights vaccine price as the main driver of uncertainty.
   Conclusion: Introduction of rotavirus vaccination is likely to be highly cost-effective in Mongolia, with ICERs estimated at only a fraction of Mongolia's per capita GDP. From an economic standpoint, ROTAVAC (R) is the least costly and most cost-effective product choice. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Respiratory infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. This is partially due to a lack of effective vaccines and a clear understanding of how vaccination route and formulation influence protective immunity in mucosal tissues such as the lung. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen capable of causing acute pulmonary infections and is a leading cause of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia. With multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa infections on the rise, the need for a vaccine against this pathogen is critical. Growing evidence suggests that a successful P. aeruginosa vaccine may require mucosal antibody and Th1- and Th17-type CD4(+) T cells to prevent pulmonary infection. Intradermal immunization with adjuvants, such as the bacterial ADP-Ribosylating Enterotoxin Adjuvant (BARE) double mutant of E. coli heat-labile toxin (dmLT), can direct protective immune responses to mucosal tissues, including the lungs. We reasoned that intradermal immunization with P. aeruginosa outer membrane proteins (OMPs) adjuvanted with dmLT could drive neutralizing antibodies and migration of CD4(+) T cells to the lungs and protect against P. aeruginosa pneumonia in a murine model. Here we show that mice immunized with OMPs and dmLT had significantly more antigen-specific IgG and TH1- and Th17-type CD4(+) memory T cells in the pulmonary environment compared to control groups of mice. Furthermore, OMPs and dmLT immunized mice were significantly protected against an otherwise lethal lung infection. Protection was associated with early IFN-gamma and IL-17 production in the lungs of immunized mice. These results indicate that intradermal immunization with dmLT can drive protective immunity to the lung mucosa and may be a viable vaccination strategy for a multitude of respiratory pathogens.

AB Conventional influenza vaccines are hampered by slow and limited production capabilities, whereas DNA vaccines can be rapidly produced for global coverage in the event of an emerging pandemic. However, a drawback of DNA vaccines is their generally low immunogenicity in non-human primates and humans. We have previously demonstrated that targeting of influenza hemagglutinin to human HLA class II molecules can increase antibody responses in larger animals such as ferrets and pigs. Here, we extend these observations by immunizing non-human primates (rhesus macaques) with a DNA vaccine encoding a bivalent fusion protein that targets influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) to Mamu class II molecules. Such immunization induced neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific T cells. The DNA was delivered by pain- and needle-free jet injections intradermally. No adverse effects were observed. Most importantly, the immunized rhesus macaques were protected against a challenge with influenza virus. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cholera remains a major public health problem in many developing countries including Bangladesh. The oral cholera vaccine (OCV) is now considered a key component of the public health response to cholera. Although maintaining cold chain and organizing human resource are the major challenges of vaccine delivery to the community. Here we applied an innovative approach to second dose OCV delivery to minimize financial and logistic burdens. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and compliance of second dose self-administration when the second dose was provided in a plastic bag to first dose vaccine recipients as OCV is stable for up to 42 days at ambient temperatures. We aimed to deploy vaccines (N = 112,000) left over from other studies to 56,000 people aged >= one year living in Mirpur, Dhaka to see the feasibility of self-administration strategy. During vaccination, the first OCV dose (OCV1) was given from fixed sites and the second dose (OCV2) was provided in a plastic zip-lock bag for the participant to take the vaccine two weeks later at home. Participants were instructed to keep the vaccine away from light and in a dry cool place. Empty vials were collected following the end date of the scheduled second vaccination. Of the targeted population, 41,694 (74%) received the first OCV dose whereas an estimated 38,852 (93% of those receiving the first dose) received the second dose which represents a 7% drop out rate from OCV1 to OCV2. However the average two dose coverage was 69%. A survey of a subsample 2990 (from 8551) randomly selected households revealed that almost all respondents (98.75%) appreciated this new self-administration strategy and considered the strategy to be more practical and convenient than the usual method. This simplified, self-administered delivery strategy provides an ideal alternative for second-dose OCV delivery in hard-to-reach populations and resource-poor settings.

AB Background: In November 2017, the World Health Organization received initial reports of suspected diphtheria cases in camps established for displaced Rohingyas in Cox's Bazar district, Bangladesh. By January 11, 2018, over 4,000 suspected cases of diphtheria and 30 deaths were reported. The Bangladesh government and partners implemented a diphtheria vaccination campaign in December 2017. Outbreak response staff reported anecdotal evidence of vaccine hesitancy. Our assessment aimed to understand vaccination barriers and opportunities to enhance vaccine demand among displaced Rohingyas in Bangladesh.
   Methods: In January 2018, we conducted a qualitative assessment consisting of nine focus group discussions and 15 key informant interviews with displaced Rohingyas in three camps. Participants included mothers and fathers with under five-year-old children, community volunteers, majhis (camp leaders), Islamic religious leaders, traditional and spiritual healers, and teachers. We recruited participants using purposive sampling, and analyzed the data thematically.
   Results: Across focus groups and in-depth interviews, trusted information sources cited by participants included religious leaders, elders, village doctors, pharmacists, majhis, and mothers trained by non-governmental organizations to educate caregivers. Treatment of diphtheria and measles was usually sought from multiple sources including traditional and spiritual healers, village doctors, pharmacies, and health clinics. Major barriers to vaccination included: various beliefs about vaccination causing people to become Christian; concerns about multiple vaccines being received on the same day; worries about vaccination side effects; and, lack of sensitivity to cultural gender norms at the vaccination sites.
   Conclusion: Although vaccination was understood as an important intervention to prevent childhood diseases, participants reported numerous barriers to vaccination. Strengthening vaccine demand and acceptance among displaced Rohingyas can be enhanced by improving vaccination delivery practices and engaging trusted leaders to address religious and cultural barriers using community-based channels.

AB In some serotypes of adenovirus (Ad), the penton base and attached trimeric fiber assemble into dodecameric virus-like particles called penton-dodecahedron (Pt-Dd), which can be internalized and used to deliver the vaccine antigens and drugs. Fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) is an important pathogen, causing seriously economic loss to poultry industry in China and other counties. Pt-Dd particles from FAdV-4 infected cells, as well as in those infected with recombinant human Ad expressing fiber-1, fiber-2, and penton base of FAdV-4, were visualized by transmission electron microscopy. For the first time, we proved that FAdV-4 produced Pt-Dd in infected cells. Pt-Dd can also be assembled by the over expressed recombinant proteins fiber-1, fiber-2, and penton base. Pt-Dd, as well as the recombinant proteins fiber-1, fiber-2, and penton base, were then used to immunize chickens. The humoral immune response, expression of selected immune molecules and challenge results were used to evaluate the immune efficacy of the vaccine candidates. Pt-Dd induced the highest level of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay antibodies and significant high levels (p < 0.05) of interferon gamma, interleukin-4, and major histocompatibility complex II expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells at 48 h post-infection. The challenge results showed that Pt-Dd, inactivated FAdV-4 vaccine, and fiber-1 induced the best protection (100%), followed by fiber-2 (80%) and penton base (67%). The present study showed that FAdV-4-Pt-Dd and recombinant fiber-1 are promising FAdV-4 vaccine candidates and could be used to replace the tissue-sourced inactivated FAdV-4 vaccine.

AB Background: Parents' attitudes and beliefs in vaccination are important to understand for shaping vaccine acceptance and demand interventions. Little research has focused on developing a validated scale to measure parents' attitudes towards vaccinations in low and middle-income countries; Ghana provided an opportunity develop a caregiver vaccination attitudes scale (CVAS) validated against childhood vaccine compliance.
   Methods: We conducted a cluster survey of 373 households with children aged 12-35 months of age from Northern Region, Ghana. Caregivers responded to 22 vaccination behavior and belief survey items and provided the child's vaccination status. In exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to assess CVAS content validity, we used parallel analysis to guide the number of factors to extract and principal axis factor analysis for factor extraction. Reliability of the scale was assessed using McDonald's Omega coefficient. Criterion validity of scale and subscales was assessed against receipt of vaccinations by 12 months of age and vaccination delay, using number of days undervaccinated.
   Results: EFA of CVAS responses resulted in removing 11 of 22 survey items due to loadings <0.30 and development of a 5-factor structure with subscales for Vaccine-Preventable Disease (VPD) Awareness, Vaccine Benefits, Past Behavior, Vaccine Efficacy and Safety, and Trust. The 5 factors accounted for 69% of the common variance and omega coefficients were >0.73 for all subscales. Validity analysis indicated that for every unit increase in the parent's scale score, the odds of the child being vaccinated decreased by 0.58 (95% confidence interval [Cl]: 0.37, 0.68) and the number of days under-vaccinated increased by 86 (95%Cl: 28,143). The final 3-factor scale included Vaccine Benefits, Past Behavior, and Vaccine Efficacy and Safety.
   Discussion: The final CVAS included three factors associated with vaccine compliance in Ghana, although several survey items suggested for use in vaccine acceptance scales were dropped. Replicating this study in several country settings will provide additional evidence to assist in refining a tool for use in routine vaccine acceptance and demand surveillance efforts.

AB Objective: A pilot study of pediatric residents to describe perceived benefits and effects of vaccines and educational influences on vaccine practice among pediatric residents.
   Study design: Eighty-seven residents, from two institutions in a region with relatively high vaccine hesitancy, responded to a survey conducted in 2014-2015.
   Results: Residents identified professional experiences with vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs) and observing pediatricians as most impactful to their vaccine beliefs. Residents who had observed pediatric faculty agreeing to alternative or delayed vaccinations were more likely to believe this to be acceptable vaccine practice (70.1% vs. 21.1%, chi(2) = 17.778, p < 0.001). Most residents (68 [79.1%]) reported feeling confident in their ability to discuss vaccines.
   Conclusions: Pediatricians must be equipped with accurate vaccine health beliefs to impact parental vaccine hesitancy. This study identifies important gaps in medical education, with pediatric residents reporting limitations in their professional experience with VPDs and high rates of observing alternative vaccination practice.

TI Demonstrating vaccine effectiveness during a waning epidemic: A WHO/NIH

AB Since its peak in early 2016, the incidence of Zika virus (ZIKV) cases has declined to such low levels that Phase 3 field efficacy trials may be infeasible. While great progress was made to rapidly advance several vaccine candidates into Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, in the absence of sustained viral transmission it may be difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of ZIKV vaccine candidates by conducting traditional clinical disease endpoint efficacy studies. However, ZIKV is still circulating at low levels in some areas and is likely to re-emerge in naive populations or in sites of prior epidemics once population immunity wanes. Therefore, the public health need for a ZIKV vaccine remains. To facilitate continued ZIKV vaccine development efforts, the World Health Organization's Initiative for Vaccine Research and the National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases co-hosted a meeting of experts in March 2018 to identify strategies to demonstrate vaccine effectiveness in view of waning ZIKV disease incidence. This paper outlines points for consideration for developers, regulators, and other stakeholders working towards a licensed ZIKV vaccine. These deliberations may also be applicable to development of vaccines for other emerging infections where the size, unpredictability, and ephemeral nature of outbreaks makes clinical disease endpoint efficacy trials to demonstrate vaccine effectiveness infeasible.

AB Background: Parental reports are commonly used for adolescent HPV vaccination status but may be subjected to bias. Guided by the Socioecological Framework, our study explores potential multilevel factors influencing the inaccuracy of parental reports of adolescent HPV vaccination status.
   Methods: Data from parents of 19,683 adolescents with provider-verified data were analyzed using multilevel modeling. Correlates included adolescent characteristics, parent/household factors, number of providers seen, state-level median income, and state-level HPV vaccine policy. Outcomes included inaccuracy in reporting: vaccine initiation (>= 1 dose), completion (3 doses), and number of doses.
   Results: 24% and 25% of parents reported initiation and completion inaccurately; 28% under-reported and 11% over-reported number of doses. All adolescent characteristics, parent/household factors, and number of healthcare providers seen were associated with the outcomes. Of note, compared to parents of White adolescents, parents of racial/ethnic minority adolescents were more likely to inaccurately report all outcomes (aOR ranges from 1.43 to 1.76 for initiation, 1.45-1.75 for completion, 1.98-2.05 for under-reporting, and 1.17-1.41 for over-reporting). Households with higher maternal education (aOR = 0.70, 0.92, 0.79, and 0.80) and income (aOR = 0.54, 0.62, 0.50, and 0.70) were less likely to inaccurately report initiation, report completion, under-report, and over-report, respectively. Those having seen more providers were less likely to inaccurately report initiation and completion but more likely to over-report number of vaccine doses.
   Discussion: Being parents of females, older adolescents, and racial/ethnic minority adolescents, having lower material education, and poverty status were associated with higher odds of inaccurately reporting HPV vaccination status. These results have implications for estimates drawn from self-reports. Future research can examine sources of inaccuracies (e.g., social desirability or health literacy); they could also explore solutions (e.g., access to vaccine records) that can help parents accurately report vaccination status. State policy does not appear to have an impact on report accuracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   immunization rate; Vaccine hesitancy; Vaccine acceptance

AB Background and Objectives: Measles vaccination is important to prevent outbreak, and social capital can be an important preventive factor. However, there have been very few studies that investigated the association between social capital and measles vaccination, especially the second dose, which is more likely to be suboptimal. This study aimed to investigate the association between social capital and second dose of measles vaccine.
   Methods: Data were derived from a population-based study of first-grade elementary school children (6-7 years old) in Adachi City, Tokyo. Caregivers were asked to complete a questionnaire, and 4291 of them provided a valid response (response rate: 80.1%). Among these 4291 valid responses, 69 responses were excluded since variables for social capital measures were missing, which resulted in analytic sample size of 4222. We analyzed the association between measles vaccination and social capital including social ties, social trust and mutual aid by multilevel logistic regression analysis with a random intercept model.
   Results: About 8.9% of the children did not receive a second dose of measles-containing vaccines. After covariates adjustments, increase of one-standard-deviation of poor individual-level social ties showed 11% lower odds of receiving measles-containing vaccines (OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.80-0.99). By contrast, no significant association between community-level social ties and measles vaccination was found. Regarding social trust, no significant association between individual-level social trust and measles vaccination was found. However, increase of one-standard-deviation of poor community-level social trust showed 11% lower odds of receiving measles-containing vaccines (OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.79-0.998). There was no association between mutual aid and measles vaccination.
   Conclusion: Social ties and social trust were associated with second dose of measles vaccination. Fostering social capital may be effective in raising the low rate of second dose of measles vaccine. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   CHILDREN; EXPENDITURES
AB Background: In 2007, based on decisions by the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the CDC recommended a booster dose at 4-6 years in the varicella vaccine schedule. In 2008, a herpes zoster vaccine was recommended for use in persons age >= 60 years. The purpose of this study was to examine trends in herpes zoster hospitalization rates and assess the impact of both policy recommendations using U.S. hospital discharge data.
   Methods: Nationwide Inpatient Sample discharge data from 2001 to 2015 were used to identify primary or secondary herpes zoster diagnoses. Trends in annual total and age-specific herpes zoster hospitalization rates and average length of stay were examined. Average annual rates for the pre (2001-2005) and post (2012-2015)-zoster vaccine policy eras were compared. Absolute change in herpes zoster hospitalizations were calculated.
   Results: The rate difference of U.S. herpes zoster hospitalizations in the post vs. pre-zoster vaccine policy era was -1.9 per 100,000 population (6,200 fewer hospitalizations in 2015 than expected). Key age group rate differences: 0-3 years (-0.4 per 100,000; 50 fewer), 4-6 years (-0.6 per 100,000; 50 fewer), 7-14 years (-1.3 per 100,000; 400 fewer), 50-59 years (0.7 per 100,000; 300 more), 60-69 years (-2.5 per 100,000; 900 fewer), 70-79 years (-10.2 per 100,000; 2,000 fewer), 80+ years (-29.9 per 100,000; 3,600 fewer).
   Conclusions: Reduction of wild-type varicella due to the 2-dose varicella vaccination recommendation may have impacted declining herpes zoster hospitalization rates among children <= 14 years. The 2008 herpes zoster vaccine may have impacted declining herpes zoster hospitalization rates for adults age >60 years despite vaccination coverage <31% by 2015. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: A quadrivalent human papillomavirus (qHPV) vaccine (HPV6/11/16/18) has demonstrated efficacy and acceptable safety in international studies. However, these studies did not include participants from mainland China, which has a substantial burden of HPV-related disease. This is the first safety report with a follow-up period of up to 90 months from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of qHPV vaccine in Chinese women 20-45 years of age.
   Methods: Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive three doses of qHPV vaccine or placebo (Day 1, Month 2, and Month 6). Efficacy outcomes are reported elsewhere. Injection-site and systemic adverse events (AEs) were collected using vaccination report cards (VRCs) for 15 days following each vaccination. Serious AEs (SAES), pregnancy outcomes, new medical conditions, and fetal/infant SAES were collected during the entire study.
   Results: Of 3006 participants randomized, AEs were reported by 926 (61.8%) qHPV vaccine recipients and 856 (57.1%) placebo recipients over the entire study. Four participants (two in each group) discontinued the study vaccination due to AEs that were considered vaccination-related. Within 15 days following any vaccination, injection-site AEs prompted for on the VRC were more frequent among qHPV vaccine recipients (37.6% vs 27.8%), and systemic AEs prompted for on the VRC were similar in frequency between qHPV vaccine and placebo groups (46.8% vs 45.1%). Thirty-eight and 43 participants reported SAES in qHPV vaccine and placebo groups, respectively. No SAE was considered qHPV vaccine-related. Pregnancy outcomes, fetal/infant SAES, and new medical conditions were generally similar in frequency between the qHPV vaccine and placebo groups, and within normal ranges.
   Conclusion: The qHPV vaccine was well tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety profile in Chinese women 20-45 years of age, consistent with findings from global trials and safety surveillance studies. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: To determine if inclusion/exclusion (I/E) criteria of clinical trial protocols can be represented as structured queries and executed using a secure federated research platform (InSite) on hospital electronic health records (EHR) systems, to estimate the number of potentially eligible patients.
   Methods: Twenty-three clinical trial protocols completed during 2011-2017 across diverse disease areas were analyzed to construct queries that were executed with InSite using EHR records from 24 European hospitals containing records of > 14 million patients. The number of patients matching I/E criteria of each protocol was estimated.
   Results: All protocols could be formalized to some extent into a medical coding system (e.g. ICD-10CM, ATC, LOINC, SNOMED) and mapped to local hospital coding systems. The median number of I/E criteria of protocols tested was 29 (range: 14-47). A median of 55% (range 38-89%) of I/E criteria in each protocol could be transformed into a computable format. The median number of eligible patients identified was 26 per hospital site (range: 1-134).
   Conclusion: Clinical trial I/E eligibility criteria can be structured computationally and executed as queries on EHR systems to estimate the patient recruitment pool at each site.
   The results further suggest that an increase in structured coded information in EHRs would increase the number of I/E criteria that could be evaluated. Additional work is needed on broader deployment of federated platforms such as InSite.

AB The early diagnosis of cancer, as one of the major causes of death, is vital for cancerous patients. Diagnosing diseases in general and cancer in particular is a considerable application of data analysis for medical science. However, imbalanced data distribution and imbalanced quality of the majority and minority classes, which lead to misclassification, is a great challenge in this field. Though the samples of the majority class and their proper classification are more important to classifier, cancer is diagnosed by relying on the minority class samples (cancer data class). While the consequence of wrong diagnosis for non-cancerous patients is several additional clinical tests, the cancerous patients pay the price of wrong diagnosis with their lives. As such, studying the class imbalance problem is vital from the medical's perspective. To serve this purpose, a comprehensive study on the consequences of imbalanced data problem is performed in this paper on the data of cancer patients for the first time. In this context, oversampling and under sampling as two main balancing techniques including 18 algorithms are employed. The techniques used in oversampling are ADASYN, ADOMS, AHC, Borderline-SMOTE, ROS, Safe-Level-SMOTE, SMOTE, SMOTE-ENN, SMOTE-TL, SPIDER and SPIDER2, while under sampling techniques are CNN, CNNTL, NCL, OSS, RUS, SBC and TL. To examine the impact of balancers on the performance of classifiers, four classifiers named RIPPER, MLP, KNN, and C4.5 are employed as learners. In addition, 15 cancer data sets from SEER program used for the study are kidney, soft tissue, bladder, rectum, colon, bone, larynx, breast, cervix, prostate, oropharynx, melanoma, thyroid, testis, and lip. The findings of the study are centered on examining the impact of class imbalance on the function of classifiers, a general comparing of the function of pre-processing techniques and classifying all data sets and finally determining the best balancer and classifier for each kind of cancer data set. According to the results, significant improvement is obtained through using balancers. Assessing by AUC, the performance of different classifiers of cancer imbalanced data sets has improved in 90% of the cases after using balancing techniques. To be more precise, Friedman statistical tests are applied and interestingly, each kind of cancer data set responded differently to different balancing techniques and classifiers. Moreover, considering the mean rank of each technique and classifier that were used for data sets, oversampling balancing techniques result in better outcomes than under sampling ones.

AB Introduction: The trend of an ageing and growing world population, particularly in developed countries, is expected to continue for decades to come causing an increase in demand for healthcare resources and services. Consequently, demand is growing faster than rises in funding. The UK government, in partnership with the European Commission's Vision for 2020, propose a paradigm shift towards the delivery of more patient-centred self-care interventions, facilitated by novel ubiquitous computer mediated reality technology applications, as a key strategy to overcome the scarcity of health resources gap. If this vision is to become a reality, it is crucial that state of the art research focuses efforts on the development of applications that support the delivery of patient centred self-care interventions.
   Objectives: This study presents a conceptual framework, a system impact assessment taxonomy and systematic literature review of the state of the art in Computer Mediated Reality Technologies (CMRT) research. The intended function of the CMRT applications are considered systematically, with a view to establish the extent to which existing research focuses on delivering digitised, patient-centred healthcare applications, the care contexts in which these are delivered, and the specific CMRTs that are used to deliver such applications.
   Methods: A conceptual framework of the state of the art is derived via a systematic concept-centric incremental thematic analysis protocol. The survey considers systems that have been presented within the literature between 2010 and 2017. Primarily, the literature is considered in the context of the type of patient-practitioner relationship that the respective applications support, i.e. Traditional, Collaborative, or Patient-centred care, and the phase of healthcare intervention that is supported i.e. Primary-care, Secondary-Care and Tertiary-care. Inclusion criteria focuses on systematic CMRT implementations and analysis considers a range of clinical contexts (type), settings (location) and system specification concepts consisting of Augmented, Virtual and Mixed Reality technology in conjunction with 3D-Modelling. As a measure of the value added by respective CMRT systems, an impact assessment is carried out according to the National Service Framework Research Quality metric, and via a bespoke overall System Value score metric.
   Results & conclusion Several research challenges emerge as a result of surveying the research literature, which include: a large quantity of research effort being focused on invasive surgical procedures through CMRT from a paternalistic Traditional patient-practitioner perspective; lack of research effort in the CMRT healthcare domain that develop ubiquitous systems which specifically target the older population within the home setting; little to no consideration of ecological validity and design architecture for user or interface interaction of systems; current CMRT systems are lacking deployment on ubiquitous mobile platforms; protecting and informing patients when using sensory/camera based CMRT from the privacy of their home through self-assessment means. In terms of impact, Traditional CMRT systems achieve the highest score for Research Quality, and Patient-Centred Systems achieve the highest scores for System Value. In response to these challenges, recommendations and future research directions are proposed to overcome each respective challenge.

AB Over the last decades there has been an increasing interest in personalization: can we make sure that treatments are effective for individual patients? The quest for personalization affects biomedical informatics in two ways: first, we design systems-for example eHealth applications-that directly interact with patients and these systems might themselves one day be personalized. Hence, we seek effective methods to do so. Second, we design systems that collect the data which will one day be used to personalize treatments: hence, we need to critically consider design requirements that improve the utility of (e.g.,) personal health records for future treatment personalization. By clearly defining personalization and analyzing the effectiveness of different personalization methods this discussion highlights how we should embrace sequential experimentation-as opposed to the traditional randomized trial-if we want to personalize our informatics systems efficiently. Furthermore, we need to make sure that we capture the treatment assignment process in our health records: doing so will greatly increase the utility of the collected data for future personalization attempts.

AB Neural embeddings are a popular set of methods for representing words, phrases or text as a low dimensional vector (typically 50-500 dimensions). However, it is difficult to interpret these dimensions in a meaningful manner, and creating neural embeddings requires extensive training and tuning of multiple parameters and hyperparameters. We present here a simple unsupervised method for representing words, phrases or text as a low dimensional vector, in which the meaning and relative importance of dimensions is transparent to inspection. We have created a near-comprehensive vector representation of words, and selected bigrams, trigrams and abbreviations, using the set of titles and abstracts in PubMed as a corpus. This vector is used to create several novel implicit word-word and text-text similarity metrics. The implicit word-word similarity metrics correlate well with human judgement of word pair similarity and relatedness, and outperform or equal all other reported methods on a variety of biomedical benchmarks, including several implementations of neural embeddings trained on PubMed corpora. Our implicit word-word metrics capture different aspects of word-word relatedness than word2vec-based metrics and are only partially correlated (rho = 0.5-0.8 depending on task and corpus).
   The vector representations of words, bigrams, trigrams, abbreviations, and PubMed title + abstracts are all publicly available from http://arrowsmith.psych.uic.edu/arrowsmith_uic/word_similarity_metrics.html for release under CC-BY-NC license. Several public web query interfaces are also available at the same site, including one which allows the user to specify a given word and view its most closely related terms according to direct co-occurrence as well as different implicit similarity metrics.

TI Mining fall-related information in clinical notes: Comparison of
   rule-based and novel word embedding-based machine learning approaches

AB Background: Natural language processing (NLP) of health-related data is still an expertise demanding, and resource expensive process. We created a novel, open source rapid clinical text mining system called NimbleMiner. NimbleMiner combines several machine learning techniques (word embedding models and positive only labels learning) to facilitate the process in which a human rapidly performs text mining of clinical narratives, while being aided by the machine learning components.
   Objective: This manuscript describes the general system architecture and user Interface and presents results of a case study aimed at classifying fall-related information (including fall history, fall prevention interventions, and fall risk) in homecare visit notes.
   Methods: We extracted a corpus of homecare visit notes (n = 1,149,586) for 89,459 patients from a large US based homecare agency. We used a gold standard testing dataset of 750 notes annotated by two human reviewers to compare the NimbleMiner's ability to classify documents regarding whether they contain fall-related information with a previously developed rule-based NLP system.
   Results: NimbleMiner outperformed the rule-based system in almost all domains. The overall F- score was 85.8% compared to 81% by the rule based-system with the best performance for identifying general fall history (F = 89% vs. F = 85.1% rule-based), followed by fall risk (F = 87% vs. F = 78.7% rule-based), fall prevention interventions (F = 88.1% vs. F = 78.2% rule-based) and fall within 2 days of the note date (F = 83.1% vs. F = 80.6% rule-based). The rule-based system achieved slightly better performance for fall within 2 weeks of the note date (F = 81.9% vs. F = 84% rule-based).
   Discussion & conclusions: NimbleMiner outperformed other systems aimed at fall information classification, including our previously developed rule-based approach. These promising results indicate that clinical text mining can be implemented without the need for large labeled datasets necessary for other types of machine learning. This is critical for domains with little NLP developments, like nursing or allied health professions.

ID EXTRACTION
AB "Psychiatric Treatment Adverse Reactions" (PsyTAR) corpus is an annotated corpus that has been developed using patients narrative data for psychiatric medications, particularly SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) and SNRIs (Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor) medications. This corpus consists of three main components: sentence classification, entity identification, and entity normalization. We split the review posts into sentences and labeled them for presence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (2168 sentences), withdrawal symptoms (WDs) (438 sentences), sign/symptoms/illness (SSIs) (789 sentences), drug indications (517), drug effectiveness (EF) (1087 sentences), and drug infectiveness (INF) (337 sentences). In the entity identification phase, we identified and extracted ADRs (4813 mentions), WDs (590 mentions), SSIs (1219 mentions), and DIs (792). In the entity normalization phase, we mapped the identified entities to the corresponding concepts in both UMLS (918 unique concepts) and SNOMED CT (755 unique concepts). Four annotators double coded the sentences and the span of identified entities by strictly following guidelines rules developed for this study. We used the PsyTAR sentence classification component to automatically train a range of supervised machine learning classifiers to identifying text segments with the mentions of ADRs, WDs, DIs, SSIs, EF, and INF. SVMs classifiers had the highest performance with F-Score 0.90. We also measured performance of the cTAKES (clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System) in identifying patients' expressions of ADRs and WDs with and without adding PsyTAR dictionary to the core dictionary of cTAKES. Augmenting cTAKES dictionary with PsyTAR improved the F-score cTAKES by 25%. The findings imply that PsyTAR has significant implications for text mining algorithms aimed to identify information about adverse drug events and drug effectiveness from patients' narratives data, by linking the patients' expressions of adverse drug events to medical standard vocabularies. The corpus is publicly available at Zolnoori et al. [30].

AB A high conversion efficiency is a key factor for phosphor applications. Because the number of studies on the 5d-4f emissions of Pr3+ in oxide glasses has been limited, it is worth examining the relationship between the luminescence properties of Pr3+ and the chemical composition of the glass. Herein, we demonstrate the luminescence properties of Pr3+-doped aluminosilicate glasses. Although the internal quantum efficiency is not as high as that of conventional Ce3+-doped glasses, a faster decay (on the order of nanoseconds) is attractive for many different applications. An emissions band can be observed under X-ray irradiation, which differs significantly from photoluminescence. Although the Pr3+-P-codoped samples exhibit higher quantum efficiency than P-free glass owing to a blue shift of the optical absorption edge, the effect of P doping was not observed during X-ray induced scintillation or in the pulse height spectra under Cf-252 irradiation.

AB In the present work, we report the optical properties of Sm3+ ions doped glasses having chemical compositions (70-x) NH4H2PO4 + 15Na(2)O + 15M(2)O + xSm(2)O(3) (where x = 0.5 mol% and M = Li, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba). Structural details are obtained from XRD, SEM, FTIR, Raman and solid-state P-31 NMR spectra. Absorption (UV-NIR), emission and lifetime measurements have been performed and discussed using Judd-Ofelt theory. Various radiative parameters are calculated and discussed. Visible emissions from (4)G(5/2) excited state have been characterized and the experimental lifetimes of these levels have been compared with those obtained theoretically by using J-O approach. Quantum efficiencies are reported. The CIE chromaticity co-ordinates of the present glass matrices confirmed reddish-orange light emission. Hence the prepared samples can be treated as candidates for reddish orange light applications.

AB Intense well-polarized second harmonic light was generated by para-Nitroaniline self-assembled thin films in different polymeric host matrices. The large area films of the organic chromophore with micron thickness were produced using a modified version of capillary growth. Analysis of the generated second harmonic light indicates that the para-Nitroaniline molecules, which nominally crystalize in a centrosymmetric space group, were organized into structures with an appreciable second order susceptibility dominated by a single tensor element. Under the best conditions, the film's effective second order optical susceptibility is slightly greater than that of beta barium borate for incident light at 800 nm. Generalizing this approach to a broad range of organic molecules with strong individual molecular second order nonlinear responses, but which ordinarily form centrosymmetric organic crystals, could open a new pathway for the fabrication of efficient thin film second harmonic light generators.

AB This work reports an optical and photoelectrochemical study on the use of not edible parts of eggplant in a photovoltaic device. In this paper we employ, for the first time, the leaves and the bark of eggplant twigs, as pigment sources for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). We compared and discussed both the absorption spectra of two natural extracts and photovoltaic performances in DSSCs. We also compared, for a similar natural sensitizer, our electrolyte respect to several electrolytes reported in literature. Solar power conversion (eta = 1%) and the short circuit current density (Jsc = 8 mA/cm(2)) achieved by studied devices are higher of 27% and 110% respectively, than literature data, so far reported. Furthermore, we demonstrated, by a thermodynamic study, thermal stability up to 125 degrees C of the eggplant extract, when anchored to TiO2 layer, and finally we presented some stability tests, under solar irradiation, of the DSSCs based on this natural extract.

AB We have studied tungsten diselenide (WSe2) and tungsten disulfide (WS2) monolayer materials in second harmonic generation spectroscopy and microscopy experiments. Ultra-broadband continuum pulses served as the fundamental beam while its second harmonic spectrum in the visible and ultraviolet (UV) range was detected and analyzed with a better than 0.3 nm spectral resolution (< 2 meV). We provide dispersion data and absolute values for chi((2)) for the materials within a photon energy range of 2.3-3.2 eV. Fine spectral features that were detected within the dispersion data for the optical nonlinearities indicate the impact of near bandgap exciton transitions. The fundamental bandgap of 2.35 eV and exciton binding energy of 0.38 eV were determined from the measurements for WS2 monolayers while the corresponding values in WSe2 monolayers were 2.22 eV and 0.71 eV. Ranges for the absolute values of the sheet nonlinearity for WS2 and WSe2 are shown to be 0.58-1.65 x 10(-18) m(2)/V and 0.21-0.92 x 10(-18) m(2)/V, correspondingly.

AB Natural dye sensitizers are extracted from the leaves of indigo containing plant, Indigofera tinctoria by diverse extraction methods and assessed for the first time in a Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). Simple cold extraction and soxhlet extraction techniques were employed for extracting the dyes from the dried leaves. A considerable yield of indigo was obtained by fermentation of fresh leaves followed by alkaline treatment and air oxidation. Acidification has been carried out for enhancing the stability of the dyes. The sensitizers were characterized by FT-IR, UV-visible spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry while the fabricated DSSCs were evaluated in terms of their photovoltaic performances and electrochemical interphase charge transfer. Theoretical molecular modeling of the indigo molecule has been performed, and its UV/Vis, and IR spectra are simulated using Gaussian 09 suite of software. The maximum power conversion efficiency of 0.114% was obtained for DSSC sensitized with cold methanolic extract of dried leaves while the efficiency of 0.022% was recorded for the acidified crude indigo based DSSC.

The results reveal that the M(3-x)Ln(x)MgSi(2)O(8) (M = Ca, Sr; Ln = Ce, Eu) phosphors exhibit typical broad excitation and emission bands, which are ascribed to the 4f-5d transitions of the Ce3+ and Eu2+ ions.

AB Dynamic tuning of the resonance wavelength of subwavelength gratings in the mid-infrared (MIR) region via the permittivity change of phase-change material (PCM) has been demonstrated. A large shift in the peak of reflectance can be obtained by intermediate phase states of the Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) layer. Fano resonance (FR) can be excited and is verified by the rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) method. Non-volatile tuning of lattice resonances over a range Delta lambda of about 1.9 mu m (10.9 mu m-12.8 mu m) is achieved. Significant spectral tuning of FR can also be achieved by changing geometrical parameters as well as the angle of incidence. The wide range of the tunable FR in the technologically important MIR region offers a high resolution filter, which is useful for numerous sensing, imaging, and detection applications.

AB We synthesized Al2O3 transparent ceramics doped with different concentrations of Eu (0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0%) by the spark plasma sintering (SPS) method, and then we investigated their photoluminescence (PL), scintillation and thermally-stimulated luminescence (TSL) properties. In the PL, the samples showed a broad emission peak at 400 nm due to the 5d-4f transitions of Eu2+ and several sharp emission peaks across 550-750 nm due to the 4f-4f transitions of Eu3+ and the 3d-3d transitions of Cr3+ impurity ion. In addition to these peaks over 550-750 nm, in scintillation, the samples exhibited two broad peaks over 300-400 nm possibly due to not the 5d-4f transitions of Eu2+ but F and F+ centers. In TSL, the glow curve consisted of peaks at approximately 100, 160, 210 and 320 degrees C. The TSL intensity of the 0.001% Eu-doped sample was the highest, and the TSL response was confirmed to be linear to irradiated X-ray dose in the range from 0.1 to 1000 mGy.

AB Lanthanide-doped borate glasses represent an attractive alternative as frequency-converter for white-light generation. The CIE colour coordinates of Tm3+, Tb3+, and Eu3+ double- and triple-doped glasses can be tuned over a broad spectral range by varying the lanthanide doping concentrations and ratios accordingly. In addition, double- and triple-doping allow for a change in colour coordinates by using different excitation wavelengths. To overcome the problem of poor optical absorption of the doped lanthanide ions and to increase the optical path length for the excitation light, the as-made glass is successfully processed to a glass ceramic. The amount of crystallites grown in the glass is controlled by appropriate choice of annealing time and temperature. The glass ceramics do not only offer enhanced optical properties, but also improved thermal properties. The thermal diffusivity of the glass ceramic is one order of magnitude higher than that of the glass.

AB A novel bidirectional (up and down)-conversion luminescence agent (GdBO3:Yb3+/Tb3+), that can convert ultraviolet lights and near-infrared lights into visible lights, is employed to enhance the light capture capability of CdSe0.4S0.6 quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). In this study, the GdBO3:Yb3+/Tb3+@TiO2 photoanode is fabricated by sol-gel drop-coating method. And then, the CdSe0.4S0.6 quantum dots (QDs) are deposited on the prepared photoanode surface by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique at room temperature. The photoelectric measurements show that the light capture capability of the CdSe0.4S0.6 QDSSCs device can be obviously enhanced after adding GdBO3:Yb3+/Tb3+ nanoparticles and the CdSe0.4S0.6/GdBO3:Yb3+/Tb3+@TiO2 photoanode with 1.0% adding amount of GdBO3:Yb3+/Tb3+ displays the highest photovoltaic performance. The presence of GdBO3:Yb3+/Tb3+ nanoparticles makes CdSe0.4S0.6 QDs indirectly utilize ultraviolet lights and near-infrared lights in solar lights. In addition, the scattering effect of GdBO3:Yb3+/Tb3+ nanoparticles in TiO2 films can cause the reflection of the incident lights. The reflected lights can also be absorbed by the CdSe0.4S0.6 QDs, increasing light capture capability. The research results demonstrate a potential applied value of bidirectional (up and down)-conversion luminescence agent in QDSSCs.

AB Lu2O3:Eu3+ nanowire arrays with different nanowire diameters were successfully fabricated by sol-gel process using submicron porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates. The nanowires in each array are homogeneous and highly ordered, and have uniform diameter defined by the template. They exhibit polycrystalline with Lu2O3 cubic structure. The crystallite sizes of the Lu2O3:Eu3+ nanowires increase with the increase of the pore diameters of AAO templates and are less than that of nanopowder prepared in the same conditions due to the confinement of AAO template on the coalescence of Lu2O3:Eu3+ nanocrystallites. The Lu2O3:Eu3+ nanowire arrays within AAO templates exhibit good performances of photoluminescence and X-ray excited optical luminescence. The emission peaks can be ascribed to D-5(0)-> F-7(J) transitions of Eu3+ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3). The luminescent intensities of the Lu2O3:Eu3+ nanowire arrays also enhance with the increase of the pore diameters of AAO templates. This phenomenon is not only due to the increase of the filling ratio of Lu2O3:Eu3+, but also relates to the improvement of crystallinity. The latter mechanism is further confirmed by the fluorescent decay times of Eu3+ emission in the nanowires with different diameters. It is believed that the Lu2O3:Eu3+ nanowire array can become a promising high-spatial-resolution scintillation screen used in X-ray imaging.

AB Transparent Ce:GdYAG ceramic phosphors with different Gd3+ contents were successfully prepared by the solid-state reaction method. The absorption and emission properties were investigated at different temperatures. The highest luminous efficiency of 123.7 lm/W was obtained by Ce:YAG ceramic phosphor with the thickness of 1 mm. The addition of Gd3+ results in red-shift and broadening of the emission band of Ce3+ so that the color rendering index (CRI) increases and the correlated color temperature (CCT) decreases obviously after packaged with blue light-emitting diode (LED). The color coordinates of the Ce:GdYAG ceramic phosphor with 50% Gd3+ content based white light device are located at the theoretical white light point in the CIE-1931 chromaticity diagram. And the various CRI and adjustable CCT of warm white light emitted by this device and the high luminous efficiency make Ce:GdYAG ceramics the most promising candidate for high-brightness white LEDs and laser diodes(LDs) device.

AB The spectra of the magnetic linear birefringence (MLB) in the terbium-gallium garnet TbGG (Tb3Ga5O12) have been studied within the visible spectral range for temperature T = 90 K. Analysis of the temperature and spectral dependences of MLB has made it possible to determine the "effective" frequencies of the allowed f -> d electric dipolar transitions in rare-earth (RE) ions of Tb3+ ions responsible for the formation of quadratic magneto-optical effect in this garnet. The results of the performed magneto-optical experiments in TbGG have confirmed the Akulov's relations (for the quadratic magnetic effects) arising from the phenomenological consideration of MLB for the values of Delta n measured at the orientation of the external field in the plane (110) along the main crystallographic directions of the garnet crystal. From analysis of the experimental data on MLB was obtained that for the TbGG MLB changes quadratically with the field within the temperature range 90-300 K. At the same time with a decrease in temperature, its value grows inversely proportional to the square of temperature. A certain difference was also found in the "effective frequencies of the allowed transitions in Tb3+ ions of the garnet, which is determined from the optical absorption spectra of TbGG on the one hand, and from the analysis of the spectral dependence of MLD on the other one. It has been assumed that this difference can be due to significant distortions of the TbGG crystal lattice caused by this significant magnetostriction at low temperatures, leading to the "mixing" of the D-9 term states with the "optically resolved" states of the D-7 term.

AB The effects of Sn doping, deposition temperature, and post-annealing treatment on the excitonic behavior of ZnO:Sn (SZO) thin films deposited by dc-unbalanced magnetron sputtering have been studied. Sn doping induces the decrease of grain size and promotes the formation of oxygen vacancy-related trap states as indicated by A(1) LO mode in Raman spectra and green emission in photoluminescence spectra. Using a critical point analysis of the dielectric functions from spectroscopic ellipsometry data analysis, Sn doping blueshifts the excitonic absorption and decreases the exciton lifetime via screening the electron-hole Coulomb interaction. By varying the deposition temperature from room temperature up to 300 degrees C (SZO-3), there is no change in excitonic absorption. Then, annealing of SZO-3 at 600 degrees C under oxygen environment (SZO-6) strongly improves the excitonic absorption as well as its lifetime. Critical point analysis on SZO-6 sample clearly reveals the excitonic transition at 3.38 eV and exciton-phonon complexes at 3.66 eV. Thus, the result is important to improve the functionality of doped ZnO with strong excitonic absorption for optoelectronic applications.

AB Pure anatase, pure brookite, and anatase/brookite heterojunction (ABH) TiO2 with tunable anatase/brookite ratios were prepared via a facile hydrothermal process using Titanium (III) sulfate, as precursor and different glycine/NaOH ratios, as pH adjusting reagents. The obtained samples were characterized by XRD, Raman, FT-IR, FE-SEM, TEM, EDX, BET surface area, UV-vis-DRS, XPS, and PL. The photocatalytic performance of as-synthesized catalysts was evaluated by photodegradation of ibuprofen under simulated solar light. The photodegradation rate of A/B heterojunction TiO2 photocatalysts was greater 12.5, 8.5 and 1.6 times than that the pure brookite, pure anatase, and the commercial P-25, respectively. The complete ibuprofen mineralization (100%) was performed under simulated solar light within 5 h using the photocatalyst obtained at pH 10 (i.e. 1:3 glycine/NaOH volume ratio), however, the commercial P-25 is 75%. The optimum sample containing 61.8%A/38.2%B exhibits the best photocatalytic activity due to it has a mesoporous structure, high surface area, and the low PL intensity.

AB This study used the copolymer emulsion method to synthesize colloidal monodisperse core/shell microspheres composed of the poly(styrene-co-methyl methacrylate-co-acrylic acid) [Poly(St-MMA-AA)]. Colloidal photonic crystal (CPhC) films have prepared by using polymer composite microspheres and successfully fabricated via natural sedimentation. The synthesized results of polymer composite microsphere exhibited uniform and good morphology. The resultant of CPhC color films demonstrated vividly structural colors due to 3D CPhC nanostructures. The structural colors over full visible spectra could be tuned by controlling the filling factor of crystals and diameter of microspheres according to the Bragg law. Additionally, the structural color of Poly(St-MMA-AA) CPhC films has measured under the standard colorimetric system. This study demonstrated a approach to fabricate tunable structural color for numerous applications.

AB Dual mode Nanosensors gained tremendous interest in recent years because of their facile synthesis and dual applications. Herein we have synthesized highly fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) from Mahogany fruit shell by chemical oxidation method. The as prepared CDs exhibited selective and sensitive quenching of fluorescence by Fe3+ and also accompanied by a dramatic increase in absorption intensity. Hence these two processes led to fabricate CDs-Fe3+ system as a dual probe. D-Penicillamine (D-PA) has much affinity toward Fe3+ which resulted in recovery of almost 75% fluorescence intensity and decrease in absorption of the CDs-Fe3+ system. Thus, this tendency has been exploited for the selective detection of D-PA by both Spectrofluorimetrically and UV-Visible spectroscopically and showed a wide linear range of detection 0.48 mu g mL(-1) and 0-40 mu g mL(-1) respectively. This developed probe offered low cost, high selectivity, repeatability, facile operation and excellent recovery ratio in detection of D-PA in pharmaceutical samples. Moreover, biological applications CDs were investigated using Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain with confocal microscopy. We found that CDs were a biocompatible and ideal candidate for differential staining of yeast cells.

The measurement errors of the Faraday rotation angle and the Verdet constant of the garnet-type and garnet-groove film OCSs are measured by Thorlabs polarimeters as a function of temperature. The results show that the measurement errors of the Faraday rotation angle of the garnet-type and garnet-groove film OCSs are 1.5% and 0.3%, respectively, when the current is 700 A at room temperature. The measurement error of the garnet-groove magnetic film OCS is lower than 0.3%, when the current changes from 0 to 1000 A and the temperature changes from 25 degrees C to 80 degrees C. The Verdet constant variations of the garnet-type and garnet-groove film OCSs cause different measurement errors when the temperature is changed.

The dye-doped silica nanoparticles were synthesized by the reverse microemulsion method with the conjugate of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and rhodamine B isothiocynate. A PEG with flexible long chain as the bridge was introduced onto the surface of the nanoparticle via cyanogens bromide method. The second antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG, was conjugated on the surface of the PEG-terminal modified silica fluorescent nanoparticles by covalent binding to the PEG linkers via the EDC/sulfo-NHS method. The concentrations of goat anti-rabbit IgG covering the nanoparticles were quantified via the Bradford method. The silica fluorescent nanoparticles functionalized with rabbit anti-MUC1 antibody were employed as bioprobes for the recognition of MUC1 protein in human breast carcinoma molecules MCF-7 cells. Compared with fluorescent dye labeled IgG, the fluorescent nanoprobes display dramatically increased photostability.

AB In this work, the relative efficiency of a solar cell covered with tellurite glasses (TeO2-ZnO and TeO2-ZnO-Na2O) doped with and without europium ions and silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) placed on the top of the Si solar cell is explored. Electrical characterization was performed using a solar simulator in order to obtain the current-voltage curve at standard conditions. Efficiency results showed 12.7% enhancement with respect to a bare solar cell when europium doped: TeO2-ZnO glass with Ag NPs was used to cover the Si solar cell. Plasmonic enhancement from Ag NPs was identified as the responsible mechanism. For the case of europium doped: TeO2-ZnO-Na2O glass, it was observed an enhancement of about 11%, but in the absence of Ag NPs. The correlation between these results and the transmittance and luminescence properties of europium doped tellurite glasses, under 473 nm excitation is presented too. The present procedure represents an alternative to optimize the performance of solar cells covered by different glassy hosts. Then the efficiency enhancement of Si solar cell due to tellurite glasses doped with europium ions and Ag NPs used as cover layer opens the possibility for applications with new photovoltaic devices.

AB The optical plasmonic biosensors are an important research item in the field of bio-photonics. The graphene-molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) based hybrid structures are very useful in designing and fabrication of the high sensitive biosensors. In this paper, we designed hetero-structured Air/MoS2/Nanocomposite/MoS2/Graphene as an optical biosensor with high sensitivity. The proposed configuration for this Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) biosensor is Otto configuration. Herein, the enhancement sensitivity of this proposed SPR biosensor is investigated in different arrangement of layers. The influence of the refractive index of the coupling prism, the thickness of the nanocomposite layer, the constituent components of the nanocomposite layer and the number of the MoS2 layer is investigated and the optimal values is calculated for the biosensor with maximum sensitivity. The maximum sensitivity similar to 200 degrees/RIU is achieved with six layers of MoS2 layer and a nanocomposite layer containing the gold nanopartides and TiO2 as host dielectric.

AB The purpose of this study is to experimentally and theoretically evaluate the optical properties of a one-dimensional photonic crystal (PC) with a defect layer before and after an annealing procedure. A sputtering technique with high index (TeOx) and low index (SiO2) materials was used to fabricate the 1D PC with a defect layer. The chemical and structural analysis of a single layer TeOx thin film was evaluated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The optical constant of the single layer was also determined based on the envelope method from transmittance spectra measured by ultraviolet visible near-infrared spectrophotometry (UV-VIS-NIR). The measured reflectance spectra of the 1D PC were compared with the results simulated using the transfer matrix method (TMM) before and after the annealing procedure. A photonic bandgap (PBG) appears within the desired, near-infrared (NIR), region. The defect mode in the 1D PC was observed at lambda = 1455 nm within the PBG of lambda = 1235-1723 nm (Delta lambda = 488 nm). The reflectance spectra overall shifted toward longer wavelength due to thermal darkening effect resulting from the thermally induced optical property changes.

AB The influence of pre-annealing of lithium niobate in the range of 400-800 degrees C was studied at each step of formation of proton-exchange waveguides. Pre-annealing affects the structure and optical properties of lithium niobate. There is a relationship between the initial structure of lithium niobate and the optical characteristics of proton-exchange waveguides. The linear dependence between the deformations of the annealing proton exchange waveguides and the refractive index is established. Pre-annealing leads to an improvement in the structure of the subsurface layer of lithium niobate, as well as a slight decrease in the refractive index due to an increase in the homogeneity and a lower concentration of protons inside the crystal. The crystal structure becomes most uniform at a temperature of 500 degrees C. The results can be useful for different optical crystals used for applications.

AB The results of linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) studies on thin films of DNA based biopolymers, doped with natural chromophores extracts of sweet paprika, turmeric as well as curry leaves are reported and discussed. The thin films were obtained by spin coating on glass substrates. The spectroscopy measurements show that the extracts absorb in visible, at different wavelengths, revealing an important pi electron conjugation. The nonlinear optical measurements, done by the optical third harmonic generation technique at 1064.2 nm fundamental wavelength, show that the fast, electronic origin third order NLO susceptibility of natural extracts chi((3)) (-3 omega; omega, omega, omega), is large and comparable or higher than that measured for synthetic counterparts. The largest one in this study was found for the curry leaves extract: (396.9 +/- 40) x 10(-14) esu.

AB In the present work, we have theoretically investigated the optical and magneto-optical spectra of quasi-periodic magnetic-dielectric multilayers composed by Ce:YIG and Si organized in accordance to the Octonacci sequence. Specifically, we have analyzed the influence of the incident angle in order to show the difference between TE- and TM-polarized lightwaves. By the way, the possibility of obtaining both large Faraday rotation and high transmission has been provided for both TE and TM polarizations. The width of transmission region inside the photonic band gap (PBG) is wider for TM-mode. Also, for the most incident angles, the amounts of transmittance and Faraday rotation of the TM-mode have respectively been more than 90 % and around 40 degrees. But, TE-mode has shown larger Faraday rotations even near 90 degrees in some of the points. Finally, in order to show the impact of the results, we have made a comparison between this new investigating quasi-periodic sequence and more commonly used Fibonacci sequence. The results show that optical and MO performances of Octonacci MPCs are higher than Fibonacci ones even with upper generations.

AB Novel multifunctional NiFe2O4/Bi24O31Br10 nanocomposites were synthesized by a thermal decomposition process and hydrothermal route. The structures, morphologies, as well as the magnetic, optical and visible-light photocatalytic properties of the as-prepared nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The experimental results reveal that the NiFe2O4/Bi24O31Br10 composites exhibit an enhanced photocatalytic activity for photo-degradation of crystal violet (CV) under visible light irradiation. Among the prepared samples, the 20% NiFe2O4/Bi24O31Br10 nanocomposite displays the best photocatalytic activity, which is mainly ascribed to the efficient separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. Hydroxyl (center dot OH) radicals and holes are confirmed to be the dominant active species in the NiFe2O4/Bi24O31Br10 photocatalytic system. Furthermore, due to their excellent ferromagnetism and stability, NiFe2O4/Bi24O31Br10 nanocomposites can be easily separated from contaminant solution by using a magnet, implying that they have promising application in treatment of various dyestuff wastewaters on a large scale.

AB In this paper we report, suppression of surface defect state emission introduced in purified CdSe quantum dots (QDs) synthesized via kinetic growth method, for enhanced photoluminescence (PL) emission. The conventional method of synthesis is modified to prepare a large amount of QDs. Through this method, four different samples of CdSe QDs of different particle sizes ranging from 3 nm to 6 nm are prepared from CdO and elemental Se and studied their optical characteristics. Particle sizes are measured from TEM images as well as DLS measurements and the functional groups attached to the QD surfaces are analyzed from FTIR spectra. The influence of surface defect on PL lifetime of the QDs is studied. The synthesized QD are purified through a process of centrifugation and decantation. The method of purification adopted is to curtail the surface defect state emissions from the QD which in turn enhances the excitonic emission. The elimination of defect emission in PL spectra is further verified in laser induced PL measurements. The quantum yields of different samples are measured and an improvement up to 9% is achieved.

AB In this paper, we demonstrate a new method to obtain a low gap between the access waveguide and the racetrack cavity of a micro-resonator based on porous silica material and using standard photolithographic process. The photolithographic process is first carried out on porous silicon layers to obtain porous silicon ridge waveguides that constitutes the racetrack micro-resonator. Then the full oxidation of the micro-resonator is performed. Because of the volume expansion of silicon that occurs during its full oxidation, the gap is reduced. Lower gaps and then lower coupling distances can be obtained using a low cost photolithographic process compared to e-beam technology. This original method proposed in this paper allows to improve the miniaturization of such porous silica micro-resonators which is of great interest for integrated optical biosensor application.

AB Novel nonlinear optical chromophores JC-TCF and JC-FTCF using tetramethyljulolidine-based coumarin as the electron-donor and tricyanofuran derivatives as the electron acceptors were designed, synthesized and investigated. The obtained chromophores own good solubility in common solvents, and good compatibility with host polymers. The chromophores also have good thermal stability, and the decomposition temperature exceed 200 degrees C. The UV-vis spectra indicated that JC-TCF and JC-FTCF possess good intramolecular charge transfer ability. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to study the energy gap and first-order hyperpolarizability(beta). After contact poling, the guest-host polymer films of polymethyl methacrylate containing 20% wt JC-TCF and 20% wt JC-FTCF exhibited the highest electro-optic coefficient (r(33)) up to 40 p.m./V and 76 p.m./V respectively, and the results indicated the chromophores' microscopic beta value could be effectively translated to macroscopic EO activity, and the tetramethyljulolidine-based coumarin could be an useful candidate in the development of NLO materials.

AB This work explores the optical properties of amorphous silica (ASO) and gold incorporated silica (Au-SiO2) prepared from Rice husk (RH) which is a biomass and also an environment waste. X-ray diffraction study shows the amorphous nature of prepared SiO2 and diffraction peaks related to gold for Au:SiO2 samples. Optical absorption study reveals the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band centred at 525 nm. Photoluminescence (PL) study expose the light emitting nature of prepared SiO2 and Au:SiO2 at different excitation wavelengths. Variations in PL of SiO2 while incorporating Au is attributed to the structural modifications and metal enhanced fluorescence. Time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) conducted at different excitation and emission wavelengths show the three exponential emission decay of SiO2 and Au:SiO2 samples.

AB A three-component plasmonic Z-scheme g-C3N4/Ag/LaFeO3 photocatalyst was prepared via facile photo-reduction deposition and hydrothermal process. The photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4/Ag/IaFeO(3) composite was examined by conducting degradation experiments of RhB and phenol under visible light. The three-component heterojunction exhibited a high photocatalytic activity, far exceeding those of the single- and two-component systems, and the content of g-C3N4 impacted the catalytic activity of LaFeO3. Moreover, the mechanism for the enhancement of photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4/Ag/LaFeO3 was also investigated by the investigations of photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, photoelectrochemical measurements and radical trapping experiments. The photocatalytic activity enhancement was attributed to the synergistic effect of g-C3N4, Ag and LaFeO3, especially the effective charge separation cause by established local electric field from surface plasmon resonance effect of Ag metal. In addition, a plasmonic Z-scheme charge transfer photocatalytic mechanism of g-C3N4/Ag/LaFeO3 heterojunction is proposed.

AB Terbium gallium garnet (TGG) precursor was synthesized by the co-precipitation method from the mixed solution of terbium and gallium nitrates using ammonium hydrogen carbonate (AHC) as the precipitant. Fine and low-agglomerated TGG powders with the average particle size of 158 nm were obtained by calcining the precursor at 1100 degrees C for 4 h. Then, TGG transparent ceramics were successfully fabricated by a new two-step sintering method. The TGG ceramics pre-sintered at 1500 degrees C for 3 h in air and then HIP post-treated at 1550 degrees C for 3 h under 150 MPa argon gas showed the best optical quality and the in-line transmittance was 80.3% at 1064 nm. The Verdet constant of the TGG ceramic at 633 nm was about 136.8 rad T-1 m(-1), which was rather close to that of the commercial TGG single crystal. High transparency and high Verdet constant make it an attractive alternative for the high-power Faraday isolators.

AB An intrinsic optical fiber pH sensor coated with polyaniline (PANI)-polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) composite layer is developed and experimentally investigated in this paper. The sensor was fabricated by replacing the polymer cladding of a multimode fiber with pH sensitive PANI-PVA layer whose absorption properties as well as refractive index are pH dependent. PANI was synthesized as stable aqueous dispersion in presence of PVA and the coated film exhibits porous morphology. The experimental results demonstrate high sensitivity of 2.79 mu W/pH for 2-9 pH range. The impact of environmental temperature and ionic strength on the sensor performance are studied for the fabricated sensor along with time response and reversibility. Additionally, real sample analysis was done to test for the reliability and chemical stability of the sensor and compared with conventional method. Apart from high sensitivity, wide dynamic range and fast time response, the experimental investigations indicate that the proposed sensor possesses excellent long term stability and durability over multiple measurements.

AB This work proposes an M-shaped design of quantum wells (QWs) based on a combination of InAs and GaInSb materials forming a broken gap type II system, which can be used as an active region of interband cascade lasers emitting in the mid infrared. Results of band structure modelling revealed that compared to more common W-shaped QWs, the M-design can offer some advantages. For instance, there can be obtained a significant electrical tunability of optical transitions oscillator strength and hence also characteristic lifetimes, which would make such structures beneficial in construction of passively mode-locked laser devices.

AB We have designed and synthesized a series of a new class of pyrene substituted 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives (abbreviated as 3(a-e)) through palladium catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross coupling reaction. The chemical structures of the probes were characterized by using analytical techniques namely H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, FT-IR and GC-MS. The novel bipolar molecules consist of pyrene as an electron donor unit (D) and electron-deficient 1,3,4-oxadiazole as an acceptor unit (A) linked via extending pi conjugation through a phenyl spacer with para linkages (D-pi-A). Intramolecular charge transfer is improved by structure-property relationship. The detailed photophysical/solvatochromic properties of newly synthesized derivatives have been studied employing steady state spectroscopic techniques. The photophysical studies revealed that compounds emit strong indigo-blue fluorescence and efficient blue emission extending into blue-green in solid phase with high quantum yields. Thermal and morphological stabilities of the derivatives were studied employing DSC and TGA measurements. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) computations have been carried out to demonstrate various intramolecular interactions that cause the stabilization of the compound leading to its optoelectronic applications. The highest occupied molecular orbital energy (HOMOs), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy (LUMOs), the energy bandgap, chemical hardness (eta), softness (delta), electronegativity (chi) and chemical potential (mu) were computed with the help of frontier molecular orbitals. The results were compared and discussed with the experimental results. The results demonstrate that the novel pyrene containing oxadiazole derivatives could be used as small organic molecules for multifunctional organic light-emitting devices (OLED)/optoelectronic devices.

AB Localized surface plasmons are highly confined modes at the subwavelength surfaces. The modes provide enhanced electric field intensity sites in close proximity to the surface which display potential applications in the form of optical-sensing devices. Intriguingly, at nanoscale, the modes can also increase the optical transmission through the aperture. In this work, we analyze the light transmission through a pyramid-shaped slit based on numerical simulations. We demonstrate the phenomenon by studying the behavior of Poynting vectors in the near surroundings of the slit. Furthermore, near and far transmitted optical intensities are calculated which show the supremacy of pyramid-shaped slit over the rectangular-shaped slit. The near and far field intensity through the pyramid slit is similar to 2.25-times stronger than that of the rectangular slit. To see the influence of the shape of the slit on optical transmission, a reverse case, wherein pyramid-shaped slit is rotated by 180 degrees, is also investigated. Based on our analysis, it is shown that enhancement of the output field emanates due to the excitation of the LSP modes while directionality of the field by a single slit depends on the shape of the slit. The study could be useful for the enhancement of fluorescent and Raman emissions from the molecules that are located eminently close to the slit.

AB The growing interest on the use of colloidal Quantum Dots (QDs) in scintillation and dosimetry applications in comparison with organic fluorophores relies in their narrower and tunable photoluminescence (PL) emission, easier chemical processability and higher cross-section for ionizing radiation. In this context, a deep understanding of the role of the embedding medium on the QD optical properties in unirradiated and irradiated samples represents an important issue. In this paper, we present the optical characterization of colloidal core-shell CdSe/ZnS QDs embedded in polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) and irradiated with 2 MeV protons at different fluences. The characterization of the samples, performed by both steady-state and time-resolved PL measurements, indicates a damage of the QDs at the lowest fluence (10(13) H+ cm(-2)), demonstrated by a quenching of the QD PL intensity and by a shortening of the QD lifetime. At the middle fluence (5 x 10(13) H+ cm(-2)) a partial recovering of the QD optical properties are observed, due to energy transfer phenomena between radiation-induced PL defects in the PVOH, acting as donors, and the QDs, acting as acceptors. The higher concentration of PVOH PL defects in the most irradiated sample (10(14) H+ cm(-2)) led to an enhancement of the QD PL intensity in comparison with the unirradiated sample, highlighting the crucial role of the embedding medium in the post irradiation QD optical response.

AB GaN buffer layers were obtained by nitridation of GaAs substrates and GaN upper layers were growth by MOCVD to make the GaN/GaNbuffer/GaAs structure. It was observed GaAs crystals diffusion in GaN upper layer from buffer layer, when the growth temperature reach 900 degrees C. Photoluminescence spectrum showed the decrease in the maximum energy from 3.2 eV (381 nm) to 2.9 eV (414 nm) with contributions in 2.6 eV (462 nm) and 2.5 eV (487 nm) related to GaAs crystals diffused in GaN upper layer and hydrogen impurities respectively, which induce extended defects in the lattice. It is considered that the temperature and the growth method of GaN buffer layer, influences the photoluminescence emission of the GaN upper layer, shifting its maximum energy to low energies. X-ray diffraction patterns and transmission electron microscopy micrographs support the presence of GaAs in the GaN upper layer of the GaN/GaNbuffer/GaAs structure obtained at 900 degrees C. The decrease of GaAs crystal diffusion in the GaN upper layer is observed, when its growth temperature increases from 900 to 1000 degrees C, with a maximum energy of 3.2 eV (381 nm).

AB We report a study of the effect of nitrogen ion bombardment on the optical properties of anatase TiO2 ultrathin films, particularly the band gap energy. The TiO2 films were prepared by a sol-gel method and dip-coating process. The as-prepared TiO2 films were then exposed to a N-2(+) low-energy ion beam from a microwave electron cyclotron resonance (ESR) ion source. Raman and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) analysis were performed on TiO2 films prepared at different N-2(+) exposure times. The Raman measurements reveal the conservation of the anatase TiO2 crystalline structure after the ion beam exposure. From a detailed ellipsometric study, the thickness of layers, the dielectric function, the band gap and the Urbach energies were determined. The obtained results show an increase of the TiO2 band gap with the decrease of thickness of films during NI exposure time. The band gap energy was blue shifted from 20 meV to 140 meV as the exposure time was increased from 5 min to 20 min when the thickness was decreased from 30 nm to 21 nm. This increasing of band gap energy could be explained by the thickness effect. From the band tail, the Urbach energy was also affected by N-2(+) ion beam. These results are in good agreement with the observed broadending of the Raman band the O-Ti-O bending vibration mode, as the exposure time increases.

AB Glass ceramics of the composition PbO-Al2O3-TeO2-GeO2-SiO2 doped with CoO (ranging between 0 and 1.0 mol %) were prepared by melt quenching technique followed by heat treatment. The techniques such as XRD, SEM, EDS and DTA were employed for the characterization of the prepared samples. Conventional spectroscopic studies viz., optical absorption, photoluminescence, FTIR and Raman were also performed on these samples. The optical absorption spectra of the titled glass ceramics exhibited two principal absorption bands, one at about 594 nm and the second one consisting of multiplets with the meta centre at about 1455 nm ascribed to the (4)A(2) (F-4) -> T-4(1) (P-4) and (4)A(2) (F-4) -> T-4(5) (F-4) transitions of tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+- ions, respectively. Besides these, the spectra also exhibited two feeble bands at about 532 and 643 nm which are the characteristics of octahedrally coordinated Co2+ and Co3+ ions, respectively. Using Tanabe Sugano diagram the crystal field splitting parameter Dq, Racah parameters B, C and nephelauxetic ratio, beta were evaluated for Co2+ ions. The photoluminescence spectra of the titled glass ceramics have exhibited two broad emission bands at 628 and 870 nm ascribed to T-4(1) (P-4) -> (4)A(2) (F-4) and T-4(1) (P-4) -> T-4(2) (F-4) tetrahedral transitions of Co2+ ions, respectively. FTIR and Raman spectra of the titled samples exhibited various asymmetrical and symmetrical vibrational bands due to viz., silicate, germanate, PbO4, PbO6, AlO6, TeO4, TeO3 and Co-III-O vibrations in the glass ceramic matrix. The spectroscopic investigations on the titled glass ceramics have revealed that if CoO is present in small quantities the cobalt ions predominantly occupy the octahedral sites in the glass network, whereas the tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ ions are found to increase if the concentration of nucleating agent CoO is gradually increased up to 1.0 mol%. As a result the degree of depolymerization of the glass network decreases which in turn enhances its rigidity with increasing the concentration of nucleating agent CoO. From these investigations we report that the glass ceramics doped with 1.0 mol% of CoO are suitable for insulating devices as well as for photonic devices.

Compared with hybrid remote phosphors without rGO, the rGO embedded hybrid remote phosphors exhibited higher I-L and T-L properties. We suggest that these phosphors will play an important role as promising candidates for next generation remote phosphors used to generate warm white light.

ID HETEROJUNCTION; PERFORMANCE
AB In this work, highly efficient Tandem Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) based on planar organic charge generation layer (CGL) of C70/Pentacene is proposed. It is found that the proposed CGL generate charges as well as exhibits organic photovoltaic type behavior. In addition a very thin layer of Al/LiF and PEDOT:PSS is used as electron and hole injection layer respectively to further increase the transport of electrons and holes from CGL to emissive unit. The current efficiency and luminance of red tandem device is found to be 29 cd/A and 29010 cd/m(2) at 20 mA/cm(2) and 100 mA/cm(2) respectively which is 1.855 times 1.856 times greater than that of single emitter device having current efficiency and luminance of 15.63 cd/A and 15630 cd/cm(2) at the same current densities Generally, the turn on voltage of Tandem devices is almost double as compared to single unit device. But with the proposed CGL the turn on voltage of red tandem device is found to be 5.9 V which is less than double the turn on voltage of single unit device (3 V). Therefore, the effective charge generation and transport property of proposed CGL as well as remarkable high injection property of thin AI layer and PEDOT:PSS leads to the enhancement in the efficiency of tandem OLED.

AB The Na3LuSi2O7:Ce3+ and Na3LuSi2O7:Ce3+, Tb3+ phosphors were synthesized under a weak reducing atmosphere by the traditional high temperature solid state reaction method. The synthesized phosphors were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Photoluminescence (PL) emission and excitation spectra. The effects of Ce3+ singly doped and Ce3+/Tb3+ codoped concentrations on the structure, luminescence properties and energy transfer of Na3LuSi2O7 phosphors were studied in detail. The results indicated that the energy transfers between Ce3+ and Tb3+ in the host occurred mainly via a dipole-quadrupole mechanism, and the critical distances of the ion pairs (R-c) were calculated by the quenching concentration method and spectral overlap method. Based on the good PL properties adjusting the doping concentration of the activators (Ce3+,Tb3+) might be promising as a host material for solid-state lighting and display fields.

AB Ion beam irradiation technique plays an important role for modifications in optical, structural, and surface morphological properties of materials. The tin oxide and titanium dioxide nanocomposite thin films were synthesized using RF magnetron deposition technique followed by irradiation with 120 MeV Ti9+ swift heavy ions (SHI). The optical band gap for pristine and irradiated samples was calculated by UV-visible technique and the value of direct band gap decreased from 3.90 eV to 3.75 eV. The refractive index, optical conductivity, Urbach energy, skin depth and optical density have been calculated from the UV-Visible technique. Photoluminescence (PL) technique confirmed the presence of SnO2-TiO2 in the material by showing three standard peaks at 421 nm, 484 sun and 529 nm. Surface morphology of thin film was studied by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) technique and it showed grain size dependence on the ions irradiation fluence. The crystallite size was modified by SHI and studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The crystallite size increased from 23.97 nm to 26.07 nm as calculated using Debye-Scherrer's formula and it also increased from 54.78 nm to 67.60 nm as obtained by Williamson-Hall equation. Based on the uniform deformation model (UDM), the strain and stress in thin films and dislocation density were calculated. The calculated roughness exponent and RMS roughness varied with irradiation fluence. Depth profiling and elemental analysis were observed by Rutherford Backscattering (RBS) technique.

AB To develop long-afterglow luminescent materials for white LEDs application, a series of Sr1.97MgSi2O7-1.5xNx:0.01Eu(2+),0.02Dy(3+) (0 <= x <= 0.49) phosphors were designed. The single-phase samples were confirmed and the introduction of N was verified by the XRD patterns and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum. The average particle size of the phosphors was determined to be about 4.9 mu m. When the N is doped, it has been found the Eu2+ emission intensity decreases gradually, which could be owing to the increasing crystal defects by the nonequivalent substitution between N and O. The excitation spectra reveal that the broad and strong excitation bands from 240 to 450 nm can well match the LED chip. It is interesting that the incorporation of N can improve the afterglow time, which has been interpreted by the thermoluminescence curves. The investigation of the temperature-dependent luminescence indicates a beneficial effect on the thermal stability by doping N in the phosphors.

AB 10 at.% Yb:Y3Sc1.5Al3.5O12 (Yb:YSAG) transparent ceramics were fabricated by the solid state reactive of high-purity Y2O3, alpha-Al2O3, Yb2O3 and Sc2O3 powders, utilizing MgO and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as the sintering aids. The Yb:YSAG ceramic sample sintered at 1820 degrees C for 10 h has a dense and homogenous microstructure with average grain size of 26.9 mu m, whose in-line transmittance reaches 83.2% at 1100 nm (2 mm thick). The absorption and emission cross sections are calculated to be 5.09 x 10(-21) cm(2) at 941 nm and 12.33 x 10(-21) cm(2) at 1031 nm, respectively. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the main emission peak centered at 1031 nm is 12.4 nm, which is about 1.3 times larger than that of the 10 at.% Yb:YAG ceramics. By using the three-mirror resonator, the Yb:YSAG ceramic laser output power of 1.67 W at 1031 nm and slope efficiency of 13.1% were obtained with an output coupler (OC) of T = 5%.

ID BEAMS; END
AB Polymer waveguide bridges with high reproducibility up to 750 mu m in length were optically written between two single-mode optical fibers. Fiber ends were treated by adhesion promoter to covalently bond to both the silica fiber and the photopolymer waveguide, the mechanical properties of both long and short bridges were improved. The optical insertion loss was 0.5 dB for the longest waveguide. The mechanical properties and optical transmission of polymer waveguides were investigated under shear and tensile stress. Bi-directionally cured 500 mu m polymer bridges showed average lateral misalignment of 175 mu m before breakage. Fibers treatment also improved adhesion bonding at both polymer/fiber interfaces such that 300 mu m polymer waveguide could endure average longitudinal strain of 23% for photobleached and 32% for unbleached polymer bridges.

AB Most carbon dots (CDs) derived from natural biowastes show emission limitedly in the blue range. This work applied urea and sulfuric acid as dopants to assist the carbonization of cellulose-based biowaste willow catkin. Then a facile chemical cutting method was developed for scalable production of CDs. Under excitation at a single-wavelength of 360 nm, the aqueous solutions of CDs obtained at different cutting temperatures (100, 120, and 140 degrees C) exhibited strong blue (486 nm), green (522 nm) and yellow (545 nm) emission, respectively. The as prepared CDs also exhibited excitation-independent emission behaviors and high photostability in different pH and ionic strength. Furthermore, these long-wavelength and photoluminescence-tunable CDs were successfully applied to multicolor bioimaging in Hela cells, indicating their potential toward multimodal sensing applications in biological environment.

AB The substrate is an optically functional component of a thin film organic optoelectronic device. In the well-known context of photovoltaics, the functionality of substrate is relatively simple that of a broadband transmittance which allows almost all the incoming light into the absorber. A less explored idea is that of incorporating other optical functionalities in the substrate bulk. Such unconventional design can help surpass the performance limitations of commonly available optoelectronic materials to achieve novel functionality. Bulk functionalization of substrates is particularly easy when the substrates are made using moldable transparent materials which allow mixing of optically functional materials into a composite substrate bulk. In this paper, the example of photonic-upconversion is considered as a representative optical function, to make organic photo detectors which detect up-converted infrared light. By incorporating this functionality in a composite substrate two advantages are demonstrated in which the composite substrate architecture surpasses the performance of the conventional thin film device design. First, the composite substrate preserves the electronic performance of the device by spatially isolating the optical and the charge transport functions. Second, the composite architecture enables sub-bandgap photo-detection which is invariant with respect to the angle of incidence of the infrared input light, by placing the optical function before the light can encounter optically reflecting interfaces. In summary, the unconventional design employing a composite optically functional substrate can be extended to multiple optical functionalities and represents a key design finding that can enable considerably more efficient optoelectronic device designs.

AB Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-based luminescent materials are of prime interest for many new optoelectronic devices. This work presents the spectroscopic properties of PMMA-based composites containing KGd (WO4)(2): Yb3+/Er3+/Tm3+, KGd(WO4)(2):Yb3+/Tm3+ and KGd(WO4)(2):Yb3+/Er3+ powders. These systems exhibit effective multicolor up-conversion luminescence in VIS and NIR spectral range under 980 nm excitation. The vibrational properties of the composites were investigated for the first time using the mu-Raman spectroscopy. The obtained results suggest that the KGd(WO4)(2):Yb3+/Er3+/Tm3+&PMMA integrated system can be successfully used as a new phosphor for the up-conversion based optoelectronic devices.

AB We report a novel approach of sputter-stimulated plasmonic generation in Na-doped MgZnO (NMZO) thin films. Sputtering of material during film growth by utilizing secondary direct-coupled ion-source present in dual-ion beam sputtering system leads to the generation of nanoclusters of its constituent elements due to different sputtering-out rates of various elements present in the films. The authentication of plasmonic generation in NMZO is conducted as follows a) identification of plasmonic signature in electron energy loss spectra obtained by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurement, b) valence bulk, valence surface, and particle plasmon resonance energy calculations are performed, and each plasmon peak is indexed with corresponding plasmon energy peak of different nanoclusters, and c) spectroscopic ellipsometric measurement is deployed to verify plasmonic behavior by investigating different optical properties. Additionally, incorporation of the plasmonic feature along with alkali metals plays a crucial role in the improvement of the performance of solar cells. Therefore, plasmon enhanced NMZO as a backscattering layer in between CIGSe/back contact is probed to ascertain the additional benefits of 1) Na incorporation into the absorber layer as a result of the Na diffusion from the NMZO layer, and 2) improvement in the morphology of the CIGSe thin film with the incorporation of NMZO layer in between the back-contact and CIGSe. The diffusion of Na into the absorber layer is probed by deploying secondary ion mass spectroscopy measurements, and improvement in the morphology of CIGSe with the incorporation of NMZO layer between the back-contact/absorber is investigated using field-emission scanning electron microscope analysis.

We used highly effective thermostable phosphors: 4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,9-tridecafluoro-1- (1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl) nonane-1,3-dione - (1,10-phenanthroline) europium (III), 8-hydroxyquinoline complexes with metals and the individual organic ligand - 4,4,4-trifluoro-1- (2-naphthyl) butane-1,3-dione. Powdered HM's were prepared by co-precipitation from aqueous solutions. The effect of organic molecules or molecular fragments on dimension and morphology of precipitated PbF2 particles, the luminescence properties of HM's were investigated for the samples obtained directly after the precipitation-drying procedure, and after the powders' calcination procedure. The change in the photoluminescence spectra after the heat treatment of the powders is caused by the proceeding of the exchange reaction between the metal complex and the matrix with the formation of Pb-complexes of different coordination is shown. HM (glasses PbF2-B2O3, PbF2-B2O3-SiO2 or PbF2-B2O3-SiO2-ZnO phosphor) were obtained by the melt process in which the phosphor powder was submerged into the melt of the pre-synthesized glasses.

AB Growth of pure and oxalic acid (OA) added zinc thiourea chloride (ZTC) crystals was achieved by slow evaporation method. The structural parameters of these have been confirmed by single crystal XRD. Incorporation/presence of OA in ZTC crystal was established by EDS. Optical transparency of grown crystals has been evaluated in 200-900 nm region and linear optical constants are examined in visible region using the UV-visible transmittance data. SHG efficiency of OA:ZTC crystal is observed to be 4.51 times that of ZTC crystal tested by Kurtz Perry method. Z-scan measurement was done at 632.8 nm to confirm the nature of third order nonlinearity of OA:ZTC crystal and third order nonlinear susceptibility (chi((3))), refraction (n(2)) and absorption coefficient (beta) were evaluated. Mechanical behavior of OA:ZTC crystal is investigated using Vicker's microhardness studies. Dielectric properties of crystals were comparatively investigated at different temperature. The thermal stability and melting point of OA doped ZTC crystal material has been determined employing thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetric analysis.

AB Judd-Ofelt analysis of HfO2:Eu3+ with various europium doping concentrations, formed by plasma electrolytic oxidation, had been investigated. Omega(2) parameter is increasing, while Omega(4) parameter shows no concentration dependence. For the highest europium doping concentration of 0.62 at% Omega(2) = 4.03.10(-20) cm(2) and Omega(4) = 2.26.10(-20) cm(2). Radiative transition probabilities of each allowed emitting level were calculated. The radiative lifetime of D-5(0) emitting level and a relatively high cross section of emission D-5(0) -> F-7(2) were estimated: 1.58 ms and 13.49.10(-22) cm(2), respectively. CIELUV coordinates of photoluminescence of HfO2 doped with various europium concentrations and by excitation with UV 270 nm and 395 nm beam had been calculated and plotted to the CIE 1976 diagram. For low concentrations HfO2:Eu3+ and UV excitation the material gives almost pure white luminescence, which is an indication for its potential use as a white LED phosphor.

AB In indirect medical imaging systems, the optical transfer properties of powder phosphor materials are affected by the intrinsic mechanisms of light extinction. Light extinction (absorption and scattering) can be described either through theoretical models or with Monte Carlo simulation techniques. The purpose of the present paper is to compare both methodologies and assess the association of their optical parameters by examining either the structural (e.g., particle size) or the optical (e.g., light wavelength) intrinsic properties of the phosphor.
   Comparisons were carried out for the widely used host Gd2O2S for granular phosphors. The parameters considered in Monte Carlo simulation were: (i) a phosphor layer composed of grains with diameter 4-12 mu m, (ii) the light wavelength (420 nm, 545 nm and 610 nm), (iii) the refractive index of the phosphor (real part: 2.3, imaginary part: 10(-6) and 10(-5)), (iv) the packing density 50%. The results were compared with the Swank analytical model, based in Boltzman diffusion equation, by considering three cases for optical coefficients determination with the help of which the Luminescence Efficiency (LE) and the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) of the phosphor could be predicted.
   It was found that Swank's model seems more appropriate for estimating the MTF values, presenting a deviation less than 5% in all the frequency range. for: wavelength 420 nm, considering (i) grain size 4 mu m and thicknesses above 250 mu m, (ii) grain size 12 mu m and thicknesses above 300 mu m, (b) wavelength 545 nm, grain size 8 pm and thicknesses above 160 mu m, and (c) wavelength 610 nm, considering (i) grain size 4 mu m and thicknesses above 200 mu m, (ii) grain size 8 mu m and thicknesses above 120 mu m and (iii) grain size 12 mu m and thicknesses above 80 mu m.

AB In this paper, we present a new design of carbon-disulfide-filled photonic crystal fibers (CS2-PCFs) by combining two unrelated optical properties, ultra high nonlinearity and tunable nearly-zero flattened disperion profile. Considering the fabrication challenges and using realistic hole dimensions, we design a CS2-PCF with nonlinear coefficient of 7940 W(-1)km(-1), confinement loss of 1 x 10(-3) dB/km, total loss lower than 0.3 dB/m, nearly-zero dispersion of 0.00007 ps/(nm km) and a dispersion slope of 0.0000018 near 1550 nm. We demonstrate that the small changes due to fabrication imperfections does not have a significant effect on the dispersion characteristics or nonlinearity of the proposed PCF. In addition, we show that one can easily tune the dispersion profile of the proposed PCF by simply changing the core diameter. Therefore, the core diameter can be served as a controlling parameter to change the spectral range of flattened-dispersion profile of the CS2-PCF. The proposed PCF is a promising candidate for numerous nonlinear applications which require high nonlinearity and/or specific dispersion characteristics including applications based on four-wave mixing.

AB Herein, we report an ethanothermal synthesis of multicolor fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) by using a series of phenols and oxidants as the precursors. The emission colors of CDs are well-controlled at blue, green, yellow or red wavelengths by adjusting the combination of a phenol and an oxidant. And the naphthalenediol with highly reactivity and the oxidant with heavy halogen atom result in CDs exhibiting long wavelength emission. The resulting nanodots are characterized as amorphous aggregates with abundant oxygen species. The phenol-derived CDs can be used as highly processible fillers to fabricate epoxy composites, and a white light-emitting diode (LED) employing the multicolor CDs/epoxy composite as the light converter is also demonstrated.

AB Herein, we report the one pot synthesis of pure and Cd2+ (= 0.97 angstrom) doped PbI2 (Pb2+ = 0.133 angstrom) nanostructures by simple chemical route at room temperature. The structural phase confirmation was done by X-ray diffraction and FT-Raman analyses. Using X-ray data various parameters such as lattice constants, crystallinity, crystallite size, lattice strain, dislocation density etc. were determined. The calculated crystallite size using Scherer's rule was found to be in the range of 50-56 nm. The morphology of synthesized product was studied by SEM that confirms the formation of single crystalline nanosheets (NSs) and nanoplates (NPs). PL spectra shows an noticeable enhancement in emission intensity with Cd doping and a blue and green emission band is observed at 470 and 525 nm with more or less shifting, which makes it applicable for blue and green LEDs devices. The enhancement in dielectric constant was observed due to doping. The total ac electrical conductivity of PbI2 was found to be enriched due to doping. The radiation activity in terms of linear absorption coefficient was tested using Americium (Am-214) radioactive sources and found to be enhanced by Cd2+ doping. The prepared nanostructures are found to be highly sensitive to Am-214 59.5 KeV gamma-ray. The simple synthesis route with enhanced properties of Cd2+ doped PbI2 will be key for future electro-optical and radiation detection applications.

A solid state reaction method was used for the synthesis of ZnS:Ag, with particular emphasis on investigating the effects of the reaction temperature on the ZnS host, and of the Ag concentration on the radioluminescence (RL) output. The reaction temperature was found to control the crystallite size between 3 and 10 nm for temperatures between 75 and 500 degrees C, while the RL output was maximized for an Ag concentration of 0.2 mol%. Modified membranes were coated with ZnS:Ag powders via ultrafiltration and their response to ionizing radiation was characterized by means of RL measurements.

The physical and luminescence properties of prepared glass samples were investigated systematically. The density and refractive index increase with increasing concentration of Eu2O3. The characteristic intense red emission at 612 nm corresponding to the transition (D-5(0) -> F-7(2)) of Eu3+ ions has been observed for both oxide and oxy-fluoride glass samples. The Judd-Ofelt (J-O) theory is used to evaluate the properties such as oscillator strengths, J-O intensity parameters, radiative transition probabilities, stimulated emission cross section and branching ratios for present glasses. The J-O intensity parameters follow Omega(4) > Omega(2) > Omega(6) trend. The oxyfluoride glasses show longer decay time as compared to oxide glasses. Hence from the properties it is concluded that, the present glass samples can be a good candidate for red light emitting source in solid state lighting applications.

Single- and two-sided antireflection coatings of Ge enabled to increase its optical transmission up to 65% and 96% in the maximum transmission, respectively. The obtained films have good mechanical properties (H > 12 GPa, E = 100 GPa). Presence of Si-C bonds in the a-SixC1-x:H films restricts their range of application to the spectral interval 2.5-10 mu m. The prepared films are uniform in composition and have high adhesion to the substrate. Variation of deposition conditions makes it possible to obtain a-SixC1-x:H films having high hardness and Young's modulus. High deposition rate, optimal optical properties of the a-SixC1-x:H films and good combination of mechanical properties for the Ge/a-SixC1-x:H film structures make them to be promising for practical application as antireflection and protective coatings for germanium.

AB Nanomaterials continue to draw attention owing to their distinctive electronic, mechanical, and optical properties. Here, we synthesized one-dimensional nanowires (1DNWs), two-dimensional square nanoplates (2DSNPs), and three-dimensional nanoflower clusters (3DNFCs) tungsten trioxide (WO3) through a typical hydrothermal method. We confirm the morphologies of the nanostructures and propose a universal formation mechanism. The three WO3 nanostructures exhibit good crystallinities and thermal stabilities. We investigated the nonlinear optical (NLO) performance of the materials by the open-aperture Z-scan technique at a laser wavelength of 532 nm and a pulse width of 7 ns? Our WO3 nanostructures showed an irradiance intensity dependence transformation from saturable absorption to reverse-saturable absorption. Furthermore, the morphologies of the WO3 nanostructures were related to their NLO response. Among the three WO3 nanostructures we examined, the 1DNWs had the strongest NLO effect and the 3DNFCs had the weakest NLO activity. These results indicate that the NLO performances of WO3 nanostructures can be effectively optimized by morphological control. The observed NLO behaviors of the WO3 nanostructures are mainly attributable to nonlinear scattering and free carrier absorption. This study explores the potential for WO3 nanostructures to be applied as both saturable absorbers and optical limiters.

AB CaTiO3:Eu3+ luminescent nanoparticles (NPs) and Ppy/CaTiO3:Eu3+ nanocomposites (NCs) are synthesized via combustion and solution casting techniques respectively and their structural and optical properties are investigated. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-formed products show single orthorhombic phase. The crystallite size measurement is assessed utilizing Scherrer's technique and observed to be in the range of 40-45 nm. The impact of Eu3+ ions on luminescence properties of the produced nanophosphors is examined the outcomes are given in detail. The phosphors displayed splendid red emission at 398 nm excitation. The emission peaks observed at 540, 593, 615, 653, 696 and 706 nm (D-5(0)-> F-7(j) = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are assigned to Eu3+ ions transitions. The electronic transition equivalent to D-5(0)-> F-7(2) (615 nm) is robust than the magnetic dipole transition D-5(0)-> F-7(1) of Eu3+ ions (596 nm). The CIE chromaticity co-ordinates are ascertained from emanation spectra, the obtained values are very close to NTSC standard value of red emission. Hence, the present phosphors are exceedingly valuable for display applications. The obtained results demonstrate that Ppy-assisted solution casting is an effective methodology for the synthesis of rare-earth doped CaTiO3:Eu3+ nanocomposites (NCs).

AB BaWO4 nanostructures doped with different concentrations of Yttrium have been synthesized by a chemical method. The as-prepared samples were characterized by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectra. From the UV-vis spectra, it is seen that absorption band edge shifted towards the visible region upon Y doping. The X-ray diffraction and Raman analyses reveal that the BaWO4 powders present a tetragonal structure. The third-order nonlinear optical responses of BaWO4 nanostructures on the effect of Y concentrations was investigated by Z-scan technique using a continuous wave Nd:YAG laser at 532 nm. Experimental results have shown that the observed nonlinear absorption and nonlinear refraction behavior is attributed to saturable absorption and thermal nonlinear effects.

AB A study has been carried out on improving electrochromic performances of tungsten trioxide (WO3) thin films based electrochromic devices (ECDs) with inclusion of gold/poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/platinum (Au/PEDOT/Pt) microtubes. The deposited film characteristics were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). SEM results indicated that homogeneous spreading of Au/PEDOT/Pt microtubes are successfully obtained onto the WO3 layer. The electrochromic performances such as electrochromic contrast, response times and charge transfer resistance were investigated and compared with Au/PEDOT/Pt microtubes-free system in detail. Higher optical contrast (26%) and faster response times (bleaching time (t(b)): 13.83 s, coloration time (t(c)): 19.25 s) were obtained for electrochromic device made from Au/PEDOT/Pt microtubes against an applied potential of +/- 2 V. Especially, Au/PEDOT/Pt microtubes-based ECD exhibited stronger electrochromic color change from transparent to blue.

AB Simple solution combustion route is used for the fabrication of CaZrO3: Sm3+ (1-11 mol %) nanophosphors using Aloe Vera gel as a fuel. The powder X-ray diffraction profiles confirm the pure orthorhombic phase. The granular type particles with non-uniformity in the size is observed. Photoluminescence emission spectra exhibit intense peaks at similar to 571, 603, 651 and 708 nm, which are attributed to (4)G(5/2)-> H-6(5/2), (4)G(5/2)-> H-6(7/2), (4)G(5/2)-> H-6(9/2) and (4)G(5/2)-> H-6(11/2) transitions of Sm3+ ions, respectively. The photometric properties evident that the prepared samples emit bright orange - red light with 79% color purity. The average correlated color temperature value is found to be similar to 3100 K. Thermoluminescence glow curves exhibit a broad, intense peak at similar to 148 degrees C. The highest thermoluminescence intensity is recorded for 5 mol % of Sm3+ doped sample. The thermoluminescence intensity at similar to 148 degrees C is found to increase with increase of gamma-dose. The optimized CaZrO3:Sm3+ (5 mol %) nanophosphors used as a luminescent labeling agent for visualization latent fingerprints on various porous and non-porous surfaces under ultraviolet 254 nm and normal light. The obtained results exhibits well defined ridge details with high sensitivity, selectivity, and low background hindrance which showed greater advantages. Extensive fingerprint details, namely level II and III features are clearly revealed. Hence, aforementioned results evident that the optimized sample endorse wide spread of applications, namely solid state lighting, high temperature dosimetry and advanced forensic science fields.

AB The Cr-SiO2 photonic crystals, featured with two-dimensional structure and optical variation, was prepared by magnetron sputtering and electron beam lithography method. The finite difference time domain method (FDTD) is used to study the light-modulated characteristics of photonic crystals. Hue difference ((sic)H) was used to evaluate the optical variations of photonic crystals, and bigger (sic)H indicates stronger angle dependency of color variation. Various parameters are analyzed for their impact upon (sic)H, including hole geometry (radium, r), hole gap (distance between the centers of two circles, d) and hole depth (h). The results matched the ones from simulation. Carbon quantum dots and up-conversion nanocrystals NaYF4 were inserted into the photonic crystals, and testing results of these doped crystals showed optical variation of fluorescence in the UV and IR region.

AB Spectroscopic properties of Gd3Ga3Al2O12 (GGAG) single crystals co-doped with various configurations of (Eu + Tb); (Eu + Ce); + Ce) and (Eu + Tb + Ce) ions have been investigated. The effect of distinct Ln(3+) co-doping variations on luminescence of garnet crystals was studied using the different excitation wavelengths. The Ln(3+)-Ln(3+) and host-Ln(3+) interplays have been considered in doubly and triply doped GGAG:Ln(3+). The crystals containing cerium ions are characterized by mainly broadband emission in the 450-750 nm spectral region that is adequately modified in green and red spectral range in the samples co-doped with terbium and europium, respectively. The Eu3+ luminescence in materials under study is selectively excited employing solely f-f europium transitions. Contrary to that, emission of terbium and cerium occur as result of interaction with Gd3+ and adjacent co-dopants.

AB Solid-state packing and polymer orientation are critical for achieving high charge carrier mobility in organic thin-film transistors. Four side chain substituents, 2-octyldodecyl (-20), 4-octyltetradecyl (-22), 2-decyltetradecyl (-24), and 4-decylhexadecyl (-26), were synthesized to study the effect of side chains on the molecular crystallinity and charge transport properties of diketopyrrolopyrrole-thieno[3,2-bjthiophene copolymers (DPPTTs). Achieving high-performance DPP-based polymers not only depends on crystallinity, but also on the appropriate proportions of polymer chain orientations. DPPTT22 and DPPTT26 have more coplanarity of the backbone structure and a shorter pi-pi stacking distance, but the charge mobilities are limited. The objective of this study is to determine the influence of different side chains on the layer distance and pi-pi stacking regarding 3D carrier channel formation. However, a favorable morphology is also important to improve the charge mobility. DPPTT24 shows improved mobility due to its suitable edge-on-oriented crystallinity and well-interconnected domains with small grain boundaries.

AB Nanosphere lithography is an effective technique for high throughput fabrication of well-ordered patterns on large areas. This study reports on nanostructuring of silicon samples by means of Ag ions implantation through self-organized polystyrene (PS) masks. The PS nanospheres with a diameter of similar to 150 nm were self-assembled in a hexagonal array on top of Si(100) wafers, and then used as a mask for subsequent 60 keV silver ion implantation. Different fluences were applied up to 2 x 10(16) ions/cm(2) in order to create a distribution of different sizes and densities of buried metal nanoparticles. The surface morphology and the subsurface structures were studied by scanning electron microscopy and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy, as a function of the mask deformation upon irradiation and the implantation parameters itself. We demonstrate that Ag is implanted into Si only through the mask openings, thus forming a regular array of amorphized regions over the wide area of silicon substrate. These fragments are of similar dimensions of the spheres with widths of about 190 nm and distributed over 60 nm in depth due to the given ion range. At the subsurface region of the implanted fragments, the synthesis of small sized and optically active Ag nanoparticles is clearly observed. The samples show a strong absorption peak in the long-wavelength region from 689 to 745 nm characteristic for surface plasmon resonance excitations, which could be fitted well using the Maxwell-Garnett's theory.

AB Nanocomposites based on urethane-acrylate monomers stabilized at high concentration of silica nanoparticles were fabricated and investigated with the aim to produce efficient volume Bragg grating elements. Their sensitivity in the green spectral region and high modulation depth of the refractive index in the optically recorded elements are determined by the redistribution of combined monomers and silica nanoparticles, by the property of initiators of polymerization as well as by the parameters of recording process. The developed materials and methods can be used for creation of versatile photonic elements, for manipulation of optical wavefronts or beam propagation, for optical sensing.

AB The search for new materials for application in energy production and conversion has identified inorganic oxides doped with rare earth ions as promising candidates for the construction of photovoltaic devices for energy conversion. This work presents the synthesis of TiO2 powders doped with Eu3+, using propylene glycol in the reaction medium, changing the europium percentage at 0.2, 3 and 7 mol%, and heat-treated at 700, 750, 800 and 900 degrees C for 8 h. The results of X-ray diffraction showed the formation of TiO2 polymorphs (anatase and rutile), both belonging to the tetragonal system and also the formation of europium titanate. The Rietveld refinement showed the deformation of the network parameters and volume of the unit cell, as well as the percent composition of the phases. Raman spectroscopy corroborated the results of XRD. Photoluminescence results showed that the synthesized materials have intense emission in the red region with the most intense band positioned at 614 nm assigned to the D-5(0) -> F-7(2) transition of Eu3+ mainly in the sample with 3 mol% of Eu3+ heat-treated at 700 degrees C. The life time results showed that the photoluminescence of the materials are dependent on the crystalline structure, the host matrix in which the Eu3+ is localized, and the amount of the dopant in the sample. According to the results obtained in this work, the materials have the interesting downconversion effect, being a great absorber of UV-vis energy and converting that energy to the visible region. Materials with these photoluminescence properties associated with the structural properties are very interesting for use in the improvement of solar cells.

AB A single-phase white light emitting NaBi(WO4)(2):Dy3+, Tm3+ phosphor has been successfully prepared by conventional high-temperature solid-state method. First-principles calculations were used to investigate the electronic structures of NaBi(WO4)(2). The calculation results show that NaBi(WO4)(2) has an indirect band gap with 3.02 eV. The crystal structure and PL properties of the obtained phosphor are characterized by SEM, powder X-ray and photoluminescence spectra, respectively. The results demonstrate that all as-prepared crystalline in a tetragonal crystal system with a space group of Id. PL results confirmed that the obtained phosphors can be efficiently excited by 365 nm and generated white light emission. Then the energy transfer between Dy3+ and Tm3+ in the host NaBi(WO4)(2) was investigated. Finally, the chromaticity coordinates of preferred NaBi0.91-x(WO4)(2):0.09Dy(3+), 0.11 Tm3+ (0.3319, 0.3395) were close to the standard white light point (0.333, 0.333). All these results reveal that NaBi(WO4)(2):Dy3+/Tm3+ was a potential single phase white light-emitting phosphor candidate for NUV-based w-LEDs.

AB Stimulated luminescence of novel La2O3 nanophosphors doped with Dy3+ and Eu3+ and co-activated with Li+, prepared by microwave-assisted solution combustion synthesis, was investigated for the very first time. X-ray diffraction results indicated hexagonal La2O3 crystalline phase. Lanthanide and Li+ doping did not affect the La2O3 crystal structure. Scanning electron microscopy images showed nanoparticle morphologies such as plates, rods and irregular shapes. Photoluminescence spectra of La2O3:Dy3+, Li+ exhibited blue and green emission bands due to Dy3+ transitions. For La2O3:Eu3+, Li+, sharp emission lines, corresponding to the optical transitions of Eu3+ were observed. Thermoluminescence glow curve of La2O3:Dy3+, Li+ previously exposed to beta radiation exhibited a prominent glow peak located at similar to 46 degrees C, possibly useful for after-glow or persistent luminescence applications, whereas La2O3:Eu3+, Li+ curve, displayed three intense peaks at similar to 50, similar to 110 and similar to 150 degrees C. Thermoluminescent signal repeatability and decay curve asymptotic behaviour could place La2O3:Eu3+, Li+ as suitable for medium and high-dose radiation dosimetry applications.

AB Novel binuclear platinum complex (FPT)(2)Pt-2(diPic) and mononuclear platinum complex (FPT)Pt(Pic) were designed and synthesized, where FPT is N-(4-(6-(9,9-diethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)pyridin-3-yl)phenyl)-N-phenylbenzenamine, diPic is 3-(6-(2-carboxypyridin-3-yloxy)hexyloxy)picolinic acid, and Pic is picolinic acid. The photophysical, electrochemical and thermal properties, as well as electroluminescent (EL) properties for both platinum(II) complexes were studied. Compared to (FPT)Pt(Pic), (FPT)(2)Pt-2(diPic) exhibited stronger phosphorescent emission in PL spectra and higher Phi(PL), owing to the enhanced spin-orbit interaction of platinum centers. Moreover, the monochromatic devices based on (FPT)(2)Pt-2(diPic) showed better EL properties than (FPT) Pt(Pic). Based on that, the single-emissive-layer WPLEDs using (FPT)(2)Pt-2(diPic) as orange emitter and FIrpic as blue emitter were also obtained. The WPLEDs show best performances with a maximal LE of 1.3 cd/A, and a CIE coordinates of (0.35, 0.37) which is very close to the pure white emission. Work is still underway to improve the device efficiency and color purity of these iridium and platinum complexes co-doped WPLEDs.

AB In this paper, structural and optical analysis of boro-tellurite based glasses co-doped with Dy3+ and Pr3+ ions has been carried out. The glasses were fabricated by traditional melt quenching technique. XRD results confirm the amorphous-like nature of the glasses. FTIR spectroscopy was applied to explore the functional groups and interactions for the samples. The transition temperatures of glasses were identified by TGA/DSC analysis. Optical absorption and emission spectra of all the glasses have been recorded in the UV-Vis-NIR spectral range. Tauc's method was applied to determine the direct and indirect optical band gaps. Luminescence spectra show intense emission bands at similar to 482 nm and similar to 574 nm wavelengths under lambda(exc) = 388 nm corresponding to Dy3+ : F-4(9/2) -> H-6(15/2) and F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2) transitions. Decay time data revealed the occurrence of a non-radiative energy transfer from Dy3+ to Pr3+ ions. Intense emission bands are identified at similar to 602 nm (orange), similar to 487 nm (blue) and similar to 574 nm (yellow) observed upon lambda(exc) = 437 nm, corresponding to Pr3+ : D-1(2) -> H-3(4), Pr3+ : P-3(0,1,2) -> H-3(4)/Dy3+ : F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2) and Dy3+: F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2) transitions, respectively, where the Dy3+ emissions are due to energy transfer from Pr3+ to Dy3+ ions. The CIE chromaticity results confirm that different colors can be generated by tuning the exciting wavelength, where all the glasses are capable to emit white light under lambda(exc) = 388 nm, while at lambda(exc) = 437 nm the samples (S2-S4) emit reddish orange light. Accordingly, it is plausible to suggest these glasses for white LED and SSL applications.

AB We experimentally demonstrate that the band gap of mixed crystals of calcium fluoride and strontium fluoride (CaF2 - SrF2, CaxSr1-xF2) can be engineered by modulating the composition ratio of CaF2 and SrF2. By increasing the CaF2 content, the band gap increases and the absorption edge is blue-shifted. A range of band gap energies can be obtained between 9.73 eV for pure SrF2 and 10.24 eV for pure CaF2. The first order Raman frequency shift increases linearly from 285.2 cm(-1) for pure SrF2 to 327.8 cm(-1) for pure CaF2. The ability to manipulate the band gap is maintained even at very low temperatures. Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoconductive detectors are fabricated to explore the effect of varying composition ratios on spectral sensitivity. The spectral response of the photodetectors shifts to shorter wavelengths as the band gap increases. This allows the spectral response to be controlled by appropriately choosing the CaF2 - SrF2 ratio. Using CaxSr1-xF2 sensors also eliminates the need for extra filters to cut off unwanted longer wavelengths as the onset of their absorption occur in the VUV region. The controllable spectral response and filterless feature of CaxSr1-xF2 photodetectors provide an advantage over currently available oxide-, nitride-, and diamond-based photodetectors.

AB In the last few years, the peculiar photoluminescence properties of radiation-induced color centers in lithium fluoride (LiF) films have been successfully used for advanced diagnostics of low-energy proton beams produced by the TOP-IMPLART linear accelerator for protontheraphy under development at ENEA C.R. Frascati. The two-dimensional spatial dose map of the transversal section of proton beams was fully reconstructed in a wide interval of doses.
   In this work the optical emission properties of LiF thin films, grown by thermal evaporation on glass and Si (100) substrates and subsequently irradiated by proton beams of nominal energy 3 MeV at doses higher than 10(5) Gy, were carefully investigated. Their structural and morphological analyses were performed by X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy. A careful comparison of the photoluminescence and photoluminescence-excitation spectra of F-2 and F3+ electronic defects was performed.
   Substrate-enhanced photoluminescence intensity increase up to 100% was observed in colored LiF films grown on Si substrates with respect to glass ones. This behavior can be substantially ascribed to the reflective properties of the Si substrate at the emission wavelengths of F-2 and F3+ CCs, although other complex effects due to the polycrystalline nature of the films cannot be excluded.

AB Thin motif-layered triclinic Cu3Nb2O8 was prepared through solid-state reaction at 700 degrees C, 12 h and their nonlinear optical (NLO) properties with ultrafast [800 nm, 150 fs (fs) pulses, 80 MHz repetition rate] pulse laser excitation were studied. A peculiar shift from reverse saturable absorption (RSA) to saturable absorption (SA) at a peak intensity of 40 MW/cm(2) was observed. The involvement of excited state absorption (ESA) is confirmed from the decrease in the nonlinear absorption coefficient with increase in peak intensity and the observed nonlinearity is ascribed to a sequential 2 PA process (1 PA+ESA). Formation of layered structure in Cu3Nb2O8 acted as a transport layers which yielded high nonlinear absorption coefficient (7.8 x 10(-10) m/W), nonlinear refractive index (5.17 x 10(-16) m(2)/W) and nonlinear optical susceptibility (25.6 x 10(-11) esu) when compared to other known copper niobates. The observation of low onset-limiting threshold (78.79-26.26 mu J/cm(2)) renders Cu3Nb2O8 a prospective material for ultrashort pulse laser protecting device and biomedical microsurgery tools. A transition of mixed phase CuNb2O6-Cu3Nb2O8 into pure triclinic Cu3Nb2O8 along with change in morphology from pore to layered structure with increase in sintering time was confirmed from powder XRD, Raman, FESEM measurements and UV-Visible absorption studies.

AB Tin sulfide (SnS) thin films were deposited on the soda lime glass (SLG) and Mo-coated SLG by radio frequency sputtering method at room temperature (RT). The structural, optical, and the photovoltaic properties were investigated by varying the argon pressure (P-Ar) from 6 to 50 mTorr. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), micro-Raman spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) confirmed that the as-grown samples at 30 mTorr pressure showed the single phase of orthorhombic SnS with the stoichiometric ratio. The variation in the grain size, shape, and a shift in the crystal plane from (111) to (101) were ascertained with an increase of P-Ar. The ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy revealed that all the SnS films exhibited a constant high optical absorption coefficient of 5.8 x 10(4) cm(-1), whereas, the energy band gap reduced from 1.50 to 1.35 eV with the increase of P-Ar. The solar cell of RT-SnS at 30 mTorr showed the best power conversion efficiency of 0.38%.

AB For the first time, an effective photostimulated creation of defects is observed under selective irradiation of the undoped Gd3Ga3Al2O12 single crystal and the Ce - doped Gd-3(Ga,Al)(5)O-12 single crystal and epitaxial film in the Gd3+ - related S-8(7/2) -> I-6(J) and S-8(7/2) -> P-6(J) absorption bands. Defects creation processes are investigated by the thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) method in the 4.2-500 K temperature range. The dependences of the TSL glow curve peak intensity on the irradiation photon energy, irradiation temperature, and irradiation duration are measured and analyzed. The activation energy of the TSL glow curve peaks creation is found to be about 0.02 eV. Possible mechanisms of defects creation under irradiation in the absorption bands of Gd3+ in Gd3Ga3Al2O12 and Gd-3(Ga,Al)(5)O-12:Ce are discussed.

AB Two ESIPT benzothiazol derivatives and corresponding europium complexes were synthesized and characterized by the (HNMR)-H-1 spectrum, Mass spectrum, Elemental analysis, UV-Vis analysis, Molar conductivity, Thermogravimetric analysis and FTIR analysis. The fluorescence intensity of the ligands and complexes are compared, and the fluorescence quantum yields are also calculated by the reference method. The results show that two ligands emit orange fluorescence due to the ESIPT process, but both complexes emit red fluorescence after coordinating with Eu3+. Compared with the ligands, the fluorescence intensity and fluorescence quantum yield of the complexes are enhanced, and the monochromaticity is also improved. Because of the stable tetra-dentate coordination, the fluorescence intensity of EuL7(NO3)(3)center dot 2H(2)O is the strongest, and EuL7(NO3)(3)center dot 2H(2)O > EuL6(NO3)(3)center dot 2H(2)O > Ligand 6 > Ligand 7, so does the fluorescence quantum yields. The electrochemical properties of the complexes show that the HOMO energy level of EuL7(NO3)(3)center dot 2H(2)O is higher than that of EuL6(NO3)(3)center dot 2H(2)O, but LUMO energy level is lower than that of EuL6(NO3)(3)center dot 2H(2)O. These ligands and complexes have potential applications in the field of life sciences and optical materials.

AB In the field of up-conversion materials, Yb3+ is usually used as sensitizer. In this work, KYb2F7 is synthesized by hydrothermal method using Yb3+ as a part of the matrix material, and at the same time, the luminescent center Er3+ and the non-luminescent center Sc3+ are co-doped therein. It was found that Yb3+ can be introduced into the matrix material with improved luminescence properties. In addition, with the doping of Sc3+, the luminescence intensity of the material can be increased by up to five times. This testified that the doping of an appropriate amount of non-luminescent center Sc3+ can significantly improve the up-conversion luminescence intensity of up-conversion material.

AB PZT (Pb0.52Zr0.48 TiO3) ultrathin film (12 nm) was deposited on LNO (LaNiO3) film/silicon substrate by magnetron sputtering. XRD and AFM results show the highly oriented ultrathin PZT film with smooth surface suitable for optical modulation. The figure of merit K was observed increased to highest 0.25 with the 532 nm continuous-wave (CW) pump power increasing to 500mw at 0.5 THz. The variation of the tunability of dielectric permittivity and the loss were attributed to the built-in electric field caused by the optical pump. It was also found that the conduction loss was predominated in the entire loss when the external field increased.

AB Effect of Er3+-doping resulting in pronounced mid-IR fluorescence functionality was examined first in chalcohalide 65GeS(2)-25Ga(2)S(3)-10CsCl glass using positron annihilation lifetime (PAL) spectroscopy. The detected PAL spectra were reconstructed from unconstrained x2-term analysis employing two-state simple trapping model for one kind of positron trapping free-volume defects, the parameterization being performed at the example of 65GeS(2)-25Ga(2)S(3)-10CsCl glass doped with 0.6 at. % of Er3+. The observed decrease in positron trapping rate was proved to be primary void-evolution process in this Er-activated glass, like in many other chalcogenide glasses affected by rare earth doping. The nature of this effect was explained in terms of positron trapping reduction model as competitive contribution of changed occupancy sites in Ga-modified glassy matrix available for rare earth ions and annihilating positrons.

AB The feasibility of using rhenium diselenide (ReSe2) as the saturable absorber for the broadband passively Q-switched (PQS) thulium solid-state lasers was demonstrated in this paper. In the short wavelength of 2 mu m region, the combination of Tm:YLF and ReSe2 was used to achieve the PQS operation with multi-wavelength around 1900 nm. A maximum average output power of 862 mw, a shortest pulse width of 527.9 ns and a repetition rate of 54 kHz were obtained. In the long wavelength of 2 mu m region, a ReSe2-based PQS multi-wavelength Tm:Y2O3 laser around 2050 nm was realized, generating a maximum average output power of 1.04 W, a shortest pulse width of 727 ns and a repetition rate of 106 kHz. The output performance of the ReSe2-based pulsed laser is competitive among these PQS thulium solid-state lasers using the emerging two-dimensional materials as SAs, indicating that ReSe2 is a promising broadband SA for the 2 mu m solid-state lasers.

AB Single-doped color tunable phosphors Na3Sc2-xAlx(PO4)(3-y)(BO3)(y):Eu2+ are synthesized by conventional high temperature solid-state reaction method. Both the excitation and emission spectra of Eu2+ in Na3Sc2(PO4)(3) can be effectively tailored by equivalent substitution. The equivalent cation substitution of Sc3+ by Al3+ and unit substitution of (PO4)(3-) by (BO3)(3-) results in the significant distortion of the local environment neighboring the Na-O polyhedral, which enables the modulation of Eu2+ occupation on three kinds of Na sites. Besides the original occupation of Na1 site by Eu2+, equivalent cation and unit substitutions open a way for Na2 and Na3 sites to be occupied by Eu2+ ions, which leads to the significant widening of the Eu2+ emission spectrum to full-color. The mechanism of widening the Eu2+ emission spectrum is elucidated. Furthermore, the different thermal stability behaviors that Eu1 emission is better than that of Eu2 and Eu3 ions are also discussed.

AB The first Ba-containing hydrated vanadate as nonlinear optical (NLO) material, BaV2O6 center dot H2O, was synthesized by facile hydrothermal method. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction result shows that this compound crystallizes in the acentric orthorhombic space group of P2(1)2(1)2(1) with cell parameters a = 7.3993(6) angstrom, b = 8.9934(7) angstrom, and c = 9.7206(8) angstrom. UV-vis-IR diffuse reflectance spectrum shows that the compound has a large bandgap of 4.60 eV and moderate transparency range. The title compound shows second-harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency about 0.5 times of KH2PO4 (KDP). The structure-property relationship of BaV2O6 center dot H2O was clarified by the first-principles studies.

AB Two series of Na2SrSi2O6:Ce3+ and Na2SrSi2O6:Ce3+, Tb3+ phosphors were synthesized via high-temperature solid-state reaction. The obtained Na2SrSi2O6:Ce3+ phosphors exhibit an intense excitation peak at 284 and 360 nm, which was suited to the dominant emission band of a NUV light-emitting-diode (LED) chip. In the Ce3+ single doped system, the critical quench concentration of the phosphor was approximately 4 mol% and a dipole dipole interaction was verified for the concentration quench mechanism. In addition, Tb3+ ions were introduced as a sensitizer, and the effects of introducing the Tb3+ ions are investigated by measuring the photoluminescence emission and excitation spectra, the PL decay curves, and the quantum efficiencies. Results confirm the occurrence of non-radiative energy transfer from Ce3+ to Tb3+ with an efficiency of over 60%, indicating that the developed phosphor can be used as a potential white-light-emitting phosphor for near-UV LED.

AB Generation of laser light harmonics is one of the nonlinear optical phenomena offering unique opportunities for the development of applications in fields like photonics, materials science, chemistry, or medicine. Traditional nonlinear crystals are millimetre-scale, thus current trends of device miniaturization require alternative strategies for generating harmonics from micro- and nano-scaled objects. Recently, several research groups showed that plasmonic metal nanostructures can be useful for generating harmonics from nanoscale volumes. As a more efficient alternative to full metallic nanostructures, an increasing amount of effort is currently put into the study of hybrid nano-architectures, obtained by combining a nonlinear-active material - as the source of harmonics, and a plasmonic nanostructure - as the amplifier of the generated harmonics. Here, we review the current state of the art concerning laser harmonics generation with hybrid nonlinear/noble metal nanostructures. After giving brief introductions into the fields of harmonics generation and plasmonics, we highlight the different kinds of hybrid nanostructures that were successfully employed to generate enhanced second-, third- or higher harmonics. We describe nanofabrication approaches, but also findings related to the physical mechanisms involved in the enhancement process, such as correlations between surface plasmon resonances and harmonic generation efficiency or the origin of the enhanced signal.

AB We present a method derived from Mott and Davies or Cody equation for calculating energy gap based on spectrophotometric measurements. The method has been tested on thin film TiO2 and MoS2/TiO2 bilayer produced by RF magnetron sputtering. The presented examples indicate that the Tauc and McLean methods, which are usually used to analyse data, are not justified in many cases, especially for multilayers. In the Tauc method, the problem is to determine the energy gap without knowing the nature of the optical transition. The McLean method involves fitting the power function which may cause difficulties in the proper selection of the fitting range. The presented method is based on the transformation of measurement data using inverse logarithmic derivative and performing of linear fittings. Our method does not assume value of the parameter m describing the nature of the optical transition and does not require knowledge of the thickness of the layers. The value of energy gap and parameter m can be obtained simultaneously thanks to one linear fit. In addition, this method has a practical advantages over methods of McLean and Tauc, which are described in the article.

AB We present a simple design of a six-band terahertz metamaterial absorber (MMA). The unit-cell of the MMA consists of a metallic cross-cave-patch (CCP) structure and an InSb dielectric spacing layer stands on a ground plane. The permittivity of the InSb dielectric layer can be adjusted efficiently by the variation of external temperature. The numerical simulation results show that the MMA has six distinct absorption peaks from 0.4 THz to 2.2 THz, and the absorption peak frequencies can be tuned easily by changing the external temperature. The surface current distributions of the top layer and back layer of the unit-cell structure are studied to better understand the physical mechanism of the proposed MMA. The six-band strong absorption of the MMA is originated from the excitations of high-order magnetic resonance. In addition, the sensitivity S is investigated to explore temperature sensing performance of the device, and the value of S is 10.3 GHz/K, 8.1 GHz/K, 6.7 GHz/K, 6.4 GHz/K, 5.5 GHz/K and 5.4 GHz/K, respectively. The design of the MMA could find potential applications in temperature sensing or other optoelectronic related areas in terahertz region.

AB This work reports the first double-track type II waveguides fabricated by Ultrafast Laser Inscription (ULI) in a z-cut crystal of Er-0.5% Yb0.5%LiNbO3. The light-guiding properties were explored and it was found that both polarization modes, TE and TM, are supported at a wavelength of 1550 nm. Also, a thorough spectroscopic characterization of these structures was performed. All luminescence bands of active ions and their corresponding lifetimes were measured and scanning confocal mu-photoluminescence maps were developed. Slight shifts and broadening were found, relative to the bulk, for some specific emission peaks in waveguides. Particularly, Yb3+ ions luminescence within a region up to 2 mu m from to where the laser struck during ULI processing, exhibited changes of their positions, heights and widths. The contribution of ULI to the ion environment distortions could be detected by confocal microscopy and could be decoupled from multi-site effects. This procedure can be taken as a quality control tracking of waveguides fabricated by ULI, if one considers variations in micromachining parameters (energy per pulse, speed of writing, repetition rate or pulse duration) as well as in concentration ratios of Er/Yb, or even annealing treatments. Although spectral modifications were resolved, the bulk spectra of these ions are essentially preserved in the waveguide core and surroundings. Therefore, this gives rise to explore these Er/Yb co-doped waveguides as active photonics devices, considering the rich spectra of Er3+ ions: green, red and NIR (1550 nm) emissions and the doping with Yb3+ ions to improve its efficiency.

AB Hybrid structure optoelectronic devices can bring hope to the design of new-generation functional nanodevices because they can combine hybrid structure nanomaterials with flexible and transparent substrates to maximize device miniaturization and usability. Here, we prepared a highly efficient flexible photodetector based on a SnO2/CH3NH3PbI3 hybrid structure. The photodetector exhibits a very wide spectral response range and fast response speeds. The response speeds is shorter than 0.4 s under 388 run laser irradiations at 3 V. Moreover, the device demonstrates surprising flexibility under different bending degrees and excellent mechanical stability after many extreme bending cycles. Hence, the great potential properties of inorganic/perovskite hybrid materials will make it into a promising building block in flexible optoelectronics.

AB Mesoporous titanium oxide (mp-TiO2) thin films are effective electron transport layers in hybrid perovskite solar cells. In this work the mp-TiO2 are obtained via spin coating by mixing titanium isopropoxide and poly (vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP). Optically uniform anatase TiO2 thin films are formed after annealing at temperatures >= 500 degrees C. The surface morphology shows porous structure with pore sizes of congruent to 15-30 nm. The volume porosity of a mp-TiO2 thin film is estimated for the first time by using the Volume Average Theory with the experimentally measured effective refractive index of the film, and confirmed by a statistical and 3D interactive method for void volume determination in the cross sectional image of the same film. It is found that this volume porosity varies slightly, from 40.3% to 43.6%, when the spin speed is between 1000 and 2500 rpm. However, the volume porosity is significantly reduced to 33% for a very slow spin speed like 500 rpm. Using these mp-TiO2 thin films as electron transport layers in perovskite solar cells, it is confirmed that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the cells is a function of both the mp-TiO2 layer thickness and volume porosity, giving the maximum PCE in a cell sample that combines a larger thickness and higher volume porosity.

AB Eu2+ activated aluminate Sr4Al14O25 with dual-emitting centers were prepared via a solid-state method in a reductive atmosphere. Photoluminescence emission (PL) and excitation (PLE) spectra of phosphor along with the lifetimes were characterized, which confirm the 5d -> 4f energy transition behavior of Eu2+ between 400 nm and 490 nm emission. The fluorescence intensity ratio of I-490 and I-400 in the phosphors exhibits remarkable temperature dependence, owing to the diverse thermal quenching behaviors of Eu2+ emission centers. Using the phosphors to perform thermometry, excellent temperature sensitivity is achieved in the temperature range of 293-423 K. The maximum absolute and relative sensitivity are 0.004 K-1 and 0.624% at 373 K, respectively. In particular, the dual-site luminescence of Eu2+ ions can be used as the reference signal and the temperature signal of the fluorescence temperature sensor respectively. It will be helpful to develop a new self-reference optical temperature measurement technology with excellent performance.

AB A novel polysilicon light emitting device (LED) was realized in a standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process that is based on a p-n junction reverse bias configuration. This LED can emit visible light based on the reverse bias p-n junctions in the dark. The central emitting doped structure element of this LED is n(+)-p-n(+)-p-n(+) stacked layout, which is similar to two reverse bias p-n junctions and two forward bias p-n junctions connected in series. The device mechanism for the visible light emitting process is defined by means of an avalanche breakdown process that occurs between the highly doped n(+) region and the lightly doped p region in the reverse bias p-n junctions. By using hot carriers generated in avalanche process, the emission spectrum from the device exhibits a wide spectrum whose wavelength range is from 400 nm to 900 nm at an operating voltage of 16 V. We compare the designed light intensities at the different wavelengths in other to obtain the dependency of the light emission at various wavelengths under different currents conditions. From the experimental observations, and based on the calculation of the quantum efficiency and power conversion efficiencies as related to the light emission, we confirmed that this particular LED has a better efficiency than three-terminal gated diode. The silicon light source could find some applications in on-chip optical interconnect and in electro-optical conversions in future all-silicon integrated photonic circuitry.

All components of the p(in) matrix of elasto-optic coefficients are calculated on the basis of the pi(im) matrix and elastic stiffness coefficients C-mn. Ammonium sulfate crystal should be attributed to the best photoelastic crystalline materials considering the highest values of pi(im) and p(in) coefficients. The highest values of the acousto-optic figure of merit M-2 are also established. The value of M-2 of this crystal is 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than the value of M-2 of known materials suitable for acousto-optic modulation of light in the ultraviolet spectrum region.

   Implications for shale gas exploration and production

AB Marine shales of the Lower Cambrian Qiongzhusi and Lower Silurian Longmaxi formations are extensively distributed in the Yangtze Platform. Detailed depositional and tectonic analyses and regional mapping indicated that the organic-rich Qiongzhusi-equivalent shale was deposited in an intra-shelf low-slope environment in a passive margin setting. The Longmaxi-equivalent shale was mainly deposited in a widely-distributed intra-shelf low setting in the Upper and Middle Yangtze, and in a distal foredeep area away from elastic dilution in the Lower Yangtze Platform. The transgressive and early highstand system tracts in both Qiongzhusi and Longmaxi shales produced the best-quality shale reservoirs, with high total organic matter (TOC) content (> 2%) and high quartz content (> 45%). Tectonics has substantial effects on coeval deposition of organic-rich shale and its hydrocarbon accumulation and production. Later tectonism deformed the shales and disrupted early shale gas accumulation. Recent shale gas resource exploration and geologic analysis suggested that the high rate of shale gas production is due to overpressured marine shale reservoirs with high TOC and high gas content in the tectonically-stable area. Shale gas production occurred at reduced rates in slightly underpressured shale reservoirs with lower gas content in the syncline of the tectonically-transitional area deformed by three tectonic movements. There was no gas production from shales in the tectonically-active area disrupted by at least four tectonic movements and complex faults. The results of this analysis indicate that local tectonically-stable areas in the Middle and Lower Yangtze platforms may have shale gas accumulation and production potential.

AB Palaeonvironmental interpretations and biostratigraphic zonations in northwest Borneo are still a matter of debate but are important for petroleum related applications. The outcrop of Ambug Hill, a late Miocene marine siliciclastic sequence in Brunei Darussalam, has been investigated for its foraminifera assemblage. From a 9.5 m clay-rich interval 50 taxa have been recognized and classified, whenever possible to species level. The studied fauna is characterized by mostly hyaline foraminifera, dominated by two rotaliid species: Cavarotalia annectens and Heterolepa dutemplei. Additionally, a number of miliolids, lageniids, bolivinids and also planktonic foraminifera are present but in much lower abundance. The dominance of the rotaliids points to a sea floor rich in organic carbon characterized by muddy substrates with very low light penetration and the possible growth of patchy sea grass or macroalgae in the system, as indicated by epiphytic foraminifera in the samples. The results obtained give additional insights on how the environmental conditions might have been during the deposition of the deltaic sequences very widespread in the region, and how the fauna coped with such settings. Throughout the investigated samples, the dominance of the assemblages clearly shows alternating stress conditions, typical of pro- deltaic environments.
   The large abundance of rotaliid foraminifera, points toward possible biostratigraphic applications as several taxa within this group have short biozones in the region even though have strong facies dependency. If their role as biostratigraphic indicators could be finally proven, they might be used to date the large depositional sequences occurring in the region, since planktonic index fossils are scarce due to the very proximal settings of the sediments.

AB In this study, we describe radiolarian fossils, analyze sandstone petrography and geochemistry, and perform detrital zircon U-Pb dating on the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene Shimanto accretionary complexes. These data are used to constrain temporal variations in provenance, which are related to volcanic arc activity. We also determine the behavior of the Aid Tectonic Line, which represents an out-of-sequence thrust. Based on lithology and radiolarian assemblages, we subdivide the Late Cretaceous to early Paleocene Mugi Unit into the Mg1, Mg2, and Mg 3 subunits, and the Eocene Naharigawa Unit into the Nh1 and Nh2 subunits. Detrital zircon U-Pb ages indicate that sandstones of the Mugi Unit were sourced mainly from Late Cretaceous to Paleocene igneous rocks. Nh1 sandstone records a single peak age in the Late Cretaceous, whereas Nh2 sandstone preserves multiple peaks from the pre-Jurassic to early Paleocene. The Naharigawa Unit lacks syn-depositional detrital zircons; however, felsic tuff within Nh1 records an age of 48.7 Ma, which is consistent with radiolarian ages. The Nh1 and Nh2 sandstones contain slightly higher Ba and Rb concentrations than those of the Mugi Unit, suggesting that basement had been uplifted and eroded in the source region, prior to deposition. We conclude that temporal variations in sandstone composition within the Late Cretaceous to early Paleocene Shimanto accretionary complex resulted from tectonic events that occurred in response to syn-depositional igneous activity. We infer that the evolution of the Eocene Shimanto accretionary complex was influenced by uplift and erosion of pre-Jurassic basement Late Cretaceous radiolarians were identified in subunit Mg3 that forms the footwall of the Aki Tectonic Line, which was previously interpreted as a boundary fault between the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene Shimanto accretionary complexes. The Aki Tectonic Line is re-interpreted as an out-of-sequence thrust (OST) that was active under low-grade metamorphic conditions. We classify several OSTs close to the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene Shimanto accretionary complexes, based on contrasts in metamorphic grades across the faults. Within the study area, the Aki Tectonic Line is classified as a Type-2 OST, indicating that it developed within the Cretaceous Shimanto accretionary complex at temperatures of 250-270 degrees C.

TI Origin and evolution of modern loess science-1824 to 1964
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE Loess science; Origin; Development; Spread; Rhine valley; China
AB Loess is the most important aeolian deposit of the Quaternary and plays an important role in explorations of the evolution of paleoclimate and paleoenvironment. In recent years, historians of science have been working on how loess research originated, developed, and was promoted in Europe in the early 19th century. The Chinese community has a clear history of the loess research from the late 20th century. However, it remains unclear when and how modern loess studies were communicated between western and eastern academic societies and who contributed to the development and dissemination of modem loess knowledge, especially from the western to the eastern societies. Based on books, essays, memoirs, travel notes, published letters, and other types of records from geologists, such as K. Leonhard (1779-1862), C. Lyell (1797-1875), and R. Pumpelly (1837-1923), the present study clarifies the way and process by which loess research originated from the Rhine valley and spread to Britain onto the United States and, in particular, China. It was discovered that loess was formally defined in 1824 in the Rhine valley. In the 1830s, L. Homer (1785-1864) and Lyell introduced loess research from the Rhine valley to Britain. At the same time, Lyell put forward the theory of the fluvial origin of loess and verified his theory by expanding study areas to the United States. In 1866, Pumpelly, the first foreign geologist investigating Chinese loess, put forward lacustrine formation of loess. Pumpelly's hypothesis was soon argued against in 1870 by F. von Richthofen (1833-1905), who thought loess was formed via an aeolian mode based on a wide investigation in the Loess Plateau of China. Although the above main hypotheses originated based on investigations of Chinese loess, they were not disseminated to China and received by Chinese scholars in a timely manner, and the local loess research in China launched almost 130 years later by the stimulation from work by scholars of the Soviet Union.

AB We herein use the joint inversion of P-receiver functions and fundamental mode group velocity dispersion data (9-70 s) of Rayleigh and Love waves to estimate crustal and lithospheric thicknesses at twenty three-component mobile broadband stations in Kachchh, Gujarat. Modeled Moho depths range from 35 to 43 km, while litho spheric thicknesses vary from 64 to 106 km. The main result of our modelling is the delineation of a marked crustal (similar to 2-4 km) as well as lithospheric (similar to 10-20 km) thinning and a 2-6% drop in Vs across the lithosphere-asthenosphere-boundary (LAB), within the Samkhiali graben (associated with gravity high) underlying the central Kachchh rift zone (KRZ), where 95% of the continued aftershock activity took place since 2001. Such a large drop in Vs could be attributed to the presence of carbonatite melts in the upper mantle. Our modeling reveals a 4 km crustal thinning below the central KRZ and a 4 km crustal thickening below the surrounding riftless regions. This kind of crustal structure is inferred to induce large flexural deviatoric stresses (similar to 50-100 MPa) in the upper crust, thereby, these stresses in the presence of regional plate tectonic stresses can bring the Samkhiali graben below the central KRZ near to the critical stress level. While stress-transfer, meteoric water (in the upper crust), and metamorphic fluid as well volatile CO2 flows (in the lower crust) provide the required triggering effect to the critically stressed graben structure (down to 35 km depth) for generating continued aftershock activity in the Kachchh rift zone, since 2001. We also propose that the deeper circulation of volatile CO2 through the inferred conduit (related to the 65 Ma Deccan Plume activity) extending from lower crust down to asthenosphere plays a key role in the generation of uninterrupted occurrence of earthquakes in the Kachchh rift zone, Gujarat, India.

TI Electrical Constraints on the channel flow underneath the northeastern

   sounding profile

AB The Minjiang Fault belt on the eastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau is the boundary between the Motianling block and the Songpan-Ganzi fold belt. It has recently been a focus of many geological and geophysical studies. In this paper, a NW-SE trending magnetotelluric (MT) sounding profile which crossed the Minjiang Fault and adjacent regions was used to study the deep structure of this region. The dimensionality analysis results indicate that the structure of the research area is 3-D. This is because most of the Swift and Bahr skew values are larger than 0.2 in the long period data. In contrast, impedance tensor decomposition results show a poorly-defined strike angle of N20 degrees E with the 90 degrees ambiguity removed with regional geological information. A similar strike angle was given by phase tensor analysis as well. Thus, both 2-D and 3-D approaches were applied to produce resistivity models. The resistivity model can be divided into three parts which are the Ruoergai basin, the Maerkang block and the Minshan block from west to east These three parts are separated by the Longriba Fault in the west and the Minjiang Fault in the east. The Ruoergai block and Maerkang block are characterized by highly resistive upper crust and less resistive middle to lower crust. The low resistivity layer is located beneath the Minjiang Fault and connects with the shallow low resistivity body in the upper crust of the Minshan block. The shallow conductor beneath the Minshan block may be caused by fluid and partial melt. In contrast, the widespread low resistivity middle to lower crust beneath the Minshan block, is interpreted as partial melt and can be related to the northeastward channel flow of the weakened Tibetan crust. The channel flow is interpreted to travel through the Longriba Fault in the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau and was blocked by the rigid Motianling block east of the Minshan block. This blockage caused the upwelling of partial melt in the middle and lower crust, leading to crustal deformation in the weak Minshan uplift zone. As a result, the Minshan uplift was formed as a result of an eastward-thrusting nappe, whereas the left-lateral, strike-slip movement of the Minjiang Faults and Huya fracture accelerates the uplift of the Minshan block. The other portion of the channel flow is blocked by the Motianling block and turns to the southeast, resulting in the Maerkang block moving to the south; this phenomenon corresponds to the dextral strike-slip movement of the Longriba Fault and the sinistral strike-slip movement of the Minjiang Fault.

AB Thermochronometry of modern river sands exploits the natural sampling of detritus in a river catchment to infer plausible regional exhumation patterns, when combined with available bedrock thermochronometric information. Apatite fission track age distributions for six detrital samples are reported in this study to resolve the exhumation history of the upper reaches of the Heihe River, draining North Qilian Shan and Tuole Shan, the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The apatite fission track (AFT) ages include four major populations: late Paleozoic (300 +/- 55-293 +/- 43 Ma), early Mesozoic (223 +/- 15-205 +/- 17 Ma), late Jurassic-Cretaceous (112 +/- 6.2-84.8 +/- 5.6 Ma), and Cenozoic (63.8 +/- 5.9-19.3 +/- 1.7 Ma). The ages of these populations correspond well with the deformation and cooling history of the study area. The late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic AFT age populations record cooling events resulting from continental collision between the Qiantang and Kunlun blocks. The late Jurassic-Cretaceous AFT age populations are interpreted to record cooling events associated with exhumation of North Qilian Shan and Tuole Shan due to the collision of the Lhasa block with Asian continent. The Cenozoic AFT age populations record several cooling events. A cooling event is recorded corresponding to exhumation of North Qilian Shan and Tuole Shan due to late stress from the Lhasa-Asia collision, causing deformation nearly synchronous with the India-Asia collision. Another cooling event is recorded corresponding to uplift and exhumation in Oligocene time due to ongoing India-Asia convergence. North Qilian Shan and Tuole Shan were constructed as a distal effect of India-Asia convergence in the early Miocene while approaching their present mountain-river-basin distributions. Thermochronometry applied to Heihe River sediments provide convinced evidence of multi-stage exhumation of most northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau in the late Paleozoic-Cenozoic.

AB Marine isotope stage 2 (MIS-2), the coldest and the longest glacial during the last glacial period, was an important interval for the development and evolution of microlithic cultures. The Zhaocun site, located in the northeastern part of the North China Plain, is not only the first Late Paleolithic site discovered in the southern piedmont of the Yan Mountains, but also an important representative of Late Pleistocene strata and fossil fauna in North China. However, there have been few studies of the upper cultural layer at the site which have focused on the development of Paleolithic culture, especially the microlithic technology, in the context of environmental changes; moreover, no absolute age determinations are available. Here we present a study of the paleoenvironmental record of the Zhibuchang profile at the Zhaocun site during the interval of 27.6-23.6 cal. kyr BP. We conducted a stratigraphic study based on pollen and grain-size analyses of 78 samples from the profile, and obtained 7 AMS C-14 dates. During 27.6-26.6 cal. kyr BP, the regional vegetation was relatively diverse meadow steppe dominated by Artemisia and Asteraceae. The climate, although colder and drier than today, was the warmest record within the studied profile, and was relatively favorable for human beings. From 26.6 cal. kyr BP, with the onset of the Last Glacial Maximum, the climate became colder and more variable, with two extreme climatic events occurred at 26.2-25.5 cal. kyr BP and 24.3-23.6 cal. kyr BP, respectively. A cold wet event from 26.2 to 25.5 cal. kyr BP led to a drastic decline in local biodiversity, which would have resulted in food shortages for human beings. In addition, previous areas available for human activities were gradually flooded due to the rising river level, forcing the relocation of human beings and resulting in the termination of the cultural layer. A cold dry event from 24.3 to 23.6 cal. kyr BP, which may correspond to North Atlantic Heinrich event 2, caused a further deterioration of the environment for human beings, and may be a major cause of the absence of microlithic cultural remains on the northeastern part of the North China Plain during late MIS-2.

AB Pyrite framboids are spherical or ellipsoidal compact aggregates of submicron pyrite microcrystals. The various lithologies in the Chang 7 Member of the Upper Triassic Yanchang Formation contain abundant pyrite framboids, which provide an opportunity to understand the fluctuation in paleoredox conditions and relative sedimentation rates during deposition. The measured diameters of the pyrite framboids in the Chang 7 Member are characterized by large mean diameters (9.7-16.6 um) with a wide distribution range that plots in the area indicative of dysoxic to oxic paleoredox conditions during deposition of the Chang 7 sediments. Based on correlation analysis, the strong correlation between paleoredox-sensitive trace elements ratios (V/Cr, U/Th, and Cu/Zn) and the mean size of framboids indicate that the latter can serve as a reliable indicator of paleoredox conditions. The results of the framboid size distribution can also be interpreted through Crystal Size Distribution Theory (CSDT). According to CSDT, the relative sedimentation rate of the Chang 7 Member fluctuated during deposition in parallel with fluctuation in lacustrine levels. Furthermore, the strongly positive correlation between total organic carbon (TOC) and paleoredox conditions indicates that although relatively high sedimentation rate may have contributed to the dysoxic-oxic conditions that were harmful to the preservation of organic matter, but it may also have brought nutrients to increase productivity. Similarly, the correlation between TOC and relative sedimentation rates suggests that the relative sedimentation rates can affect organic matter enrichment in several ways. A high sedimentation rate is favourable for the preservation of organic matter, which can be prevented from oxidation, but large amounts of sediments can dilute the organic matter, which reduces the organic matter abundance in a potential source rock.

AB We studied a magnetotelluric transect from Tongliao, Inner Mongolia, to Baishan, Jilin, that crosses the northern segment of the Tan-Lu fault zone. Based on the profiling data, we calculated and analyzed the two-dimensional (2D) deviation degree and the tectonic strike, inverted the data using the 2D nonlinear conjugate gradient inversion method, and obtained an electrical structure model of the crust and upper mantle along the transect. Our analysis reveals that the western portion of the transect is within and at the margin of a typical sedimentary basin, and a high-conductivity layer is present in the lower crust. In comparison, the eastern portion of the transect is in the Jihei fold zone and has a relatively stable electrical structure, but its resistivity is one to two orders of magnitude higher than that of the western portion. A distinct electrical anomaly exists between the western and eastern sides. The Yilan-Yitong Fault of the northern segment of the Tan-Lu fault zone dips to the northwest, has strike-slip characteristics, extends to a depth of 40-50 km, and induces upwelling of upper mantle materials. The Dunhua-Mishan Fault of the northern segment of the Tan-Lu fault zone has a clear electrical gradient, and similar to the Yilan-Yitong Fault, it also dips to the northwest. However, the Dunhua-Mishan Fault is mostly fractured, extends to a depth of approximately 20 km and is slightly smaller than the Yilan-Yitong Fault. The inferred distribution of deep resistivity values indicates that the lithosphere is generally thinner at the center of the transect and thicker at the edges: the lithosphere is approximately 150 km thick on the western end, thins eastward to approximately 60 km thick near the Tan-Lu fault zone and then gradually thickens eastward to 100 km thick.

AB Chinese loess deposits preserve abundant information on the aridification of the Asian interior and Asian monsoon evolution during the Quaternary. Although substantial progress has been made in deciphering the paleoclimatic record of the thick loess deposits in the western Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), the environmental significance of variations in the magnetic susceptibility (chi) and the ultrafine (< 2 mu m) grain-size is still unclear when compared with the central CLP. Here, we present high-resolution records of chi, frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility (chi(fd)) and grain-size (< 2 mu m and > 40 mu m fractions) of the 416-m-long Xijin loess core from the Lanzhou Basin, northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Our results indicate that the < 2 mu m fraction of the core consists of both detrital dust and material produced during pedogenesis. An integrated analysis of records of chi, chi(fd), grain-size (< 2 mu m) and clay minerals reveals that the pedogenic component of the < 2 mu m fraction is significantly anti-correlated with the > 40 mu m fraction and marine oxygen isotope record. Consequently, we conclude that the pedogenic component is a more accurate and sensitive indicator of weathering and soil formation than the chi record, and it is well suited to reconstructing high-resolution Quaternary climatic change in the western CLP. Furthermore, the proportion of the pedogenic component increased systematically over the past 2.2 million years, which may have been primarily caused by long-term global cooling since the Early Pleistocene together with the episodic uplift of the Tibetan Plateau.

AB A stretch of the schuppen belt, trending NE-SW in the western sector of the Indo-Myanmar Ranges, represents a tectonically active zone. Deformed Quaternary deposits and various geomorphic features lend evidence for the same. In a portion of the footwall block of the Sanis-Chongliyimsen Thrust, the Nazira Sandstone of the Tipam Group of Mio-Pliocene age is thrust over tilted Quaternary fluvial deposits near Tzudikong, with a displacement of more than 2 m along the plane of the thrust fault. Deformed Quaternary deposits such as tilted terraces and faulted Quaternary sediments are indicative of ongoing tectonic activity in the area. The sediments are tilted towards the southeast by varying degrees (21 degrees-39 degrees) similar to the trend of stream migrations observed at four locations in and around Tuli. In some sections, faulting has not only affected the underlying bedrock but also deformed the overlying fluvial sediments. An important morphotectonic feature representing tectonic movement along the Kongan Thrust is evident from drainage migration in the hanging wall block of the thrust. The stream has migrated towards the southeast as a result of NW verging along the Kongan Thrust, which has left behind a trail of palaeochannels. Numerous palaeochannels, mostly linear in nature, associated with the scarp of the terrace, are indicative of migration of the river. Stream migrations suggest that the two anticlines noted in the study area are possibly growing in the present tectonic regime. Multiple levels of strath terraces lend evidence to tectonic pulses in the study area, each strath representing a tectonic phase. Lineaments have been extensively mapped in the area, out of which, around 70% are parallel to the regional NE-SW trend and the other 30% are approximately perpendicular to this trend. Any movement along the NW-SE plane may be normal faults. The mountain front sinuosity index of the emerging mountain front is close to 1, which is indicative of a relatively active mountain front. Steam length gradient index and steepness index correspond with each other, with high values in the thrust zones, which is indicative of a neotectonically active region.

AB Cenozoic basin sediments around the Tibetan Plateau are valuable archives that can be used to reveal long-term interactions among tectonics, climate and weathering. However, the reconstruction of silicate weathering histories in this tectonically active region is consistently hindered by the presence of frequently embedded conglomerate and sandstone in the long sedimentary sequences. Here, we present detailed geochemical compositions of the clay components of the sediments in the Huaitoutala section (ca. 15.3-1.8 Ma) of the northeastern Qaidam Basin to reconstruct the chemical weathering history of the catchment since the Middle Miocene. Major element ratio proxies reveal evidence of four stages of change: from ca. 15.3 to 12.6 Ma, in which the clay components are characterized by relatively high Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) values (75-88, average = 81) but low mobile/immobile oxide ratios (e.g., K2O/Al2O3, Na2O/Al2O3 and CaO/Al2O3), thus indicating the occurrence of intense chemical weathering conditions; from ca. 12.6 to 6.6 Ma, in which decreasing CIA values, together with increasing mobile/immobile oxide ratios, suggesting that a long-term decrease in silicate weathering intensity occurred in the source area; from 6.6 to 2.6 Ma, in which the clay components in the sediments exhibit persistently low CIA values (66-81, average = 76.8) and high oxide ratios, which are indicative of mild to moderate chemical weathering; and since 2.6 Ma, in which the CIA values (64-80, average = 75.5) have continued to decrease with increasing oxide ratios, thus reflecting mild chemical weathering conditions. The geochemical proxy records demonstrate that the intensity of chemical weathering has continually decreased and that the Qaidam Basin has experienced continuous aridification since ca. 12.6 Ma. We suggest that Middle-Miocene global cooling-related drying has exerted a significant influence on the trend of decreasing chemical weathering intensity since ca. 12.6 Ma. In addition, the Late Cenozoic rapid uplift and exhumation of the NE Tibetan Plateau could have limited the time that the silicate rocks were exposed in the weathering profile prior to the deposition, which may have led to their weakened intensity of chemical weathering.

AB In this paper, the flexural isostatic deformation of the crustal structure and an average effective elastic thickness (EET) of the lithosphere in the central Anatolian plateau has been estimated. We have used the Vening-Meinesz model to calculate the isostatic Moho depths or crustal thicknesses due to topographic loads. The maximum Moho deepening is under the Alpine Orogenic belt throughout the southern part of Anatolian plate, whereas the Moho depths are relatively shallow in the northwestern and central parts of the region. An average EET of central Anatolia's lithosphere is calculated by multispectral coherence between EGM08 Bouguer anomalies and ETOPO1 topographic data sets. Application of spectral coherence estimation provides an average EET value of 21.3 km and hence points out that the lithosphere is deflected. In addition, density contrasts of the horizontally and vertically extended in the uppermost crust were estimated using compact gravity inversion. We interpret the uppermost crustal blocks in terms of density contrasts may contribute to the total crustal load in addition to topographic loading.

AB Gravity modeling and stress reconstructions over the Sumatra subduction margin between Indian-Australian and Asian plates provide insights into the geodynamic setting and kinematics of the area. Based on ridge-trench interaction, plate obliquity, plate age and seismicity, the area was divided into two sectors (northern and southern) for gravity modeling along two profiles. The stress data with magnitude M-w >= 5.0 and focal depth <= 100 km for the subducting plate were compiled for six zones (I-VI), and were isolated under different time-domains for high-resolution study. The reconstructed gravity models were used to isolate the events for subducting (oceanic/Indian-Australian) and overriding (continental/Asian) plates. The data sets for the subducting lithosphere were used for stress inversion to determine the predominant stress regimes for pre-earthquake and post-earthquake phases of the Sumatra earthquake of December 2004. The results were interpreted in terms of operative intra-plate stress fields, and for reconstruction of kinematics and dynamics along the Sumatra subduction margin. Analysis shows both sparse and intense seismic activities identified over different time segments in the six zones under pre- and post-December 2004 phases with respect to the incidence of Mw 9.2 off Sumatra mega-earthquake of 2004. The stress regime of the 2004 mega-event and subsequent release of strain energy through cyclic changes of the stress obliquities in the northern part of the study area account for heterogeneous coupling caused by rough topography of the subducting Indian-Australian plate. Reduction of compressive stress regime in the deeper segment of the subducting plate in the northern sector triggered twin great strike-slip dominated earthquakes in 2012 in the floor of the northeastern Indian Ocean. The weak zones of a spreading ridge subducting below the Asian plate possibly suffered strain localization and weakening. The less transmission of co- and post-seismic strain energy from northern to southern part of the margin was possibly prohibited near the zone of ridge trench interaction. The trench-orthogonal tearing (slab window) at the edge of the subducting plate in this area cannot be ruled out. The slab window, caused by the subduction of the young buoyant ridge and the trench-ward movement of the upper plate, has transformed the central segment into compressional regime.

AB We describe the structural characteristics and tectonic evolution of the NNE-SSW-striking Yangsan Fault, Korea. The surface trace of the fault extends for over 170 km on land, displaying similar to 20-30 km of dextral offset. It transects mainly Mesozoic-Cenozoic sedimentary and igneous rocks. Our field observations suggest that the style of deformation within the fault core is controlled by the ductility of the protoliths. Where sedimentary rocks have been faulted, fault cores tend to be relatively wide, having hosted multiple events. Internal fault core structures are characterized by networks of multiple anastomosing strands of fault gouge and breccia, which enclose lenses of fractured protolith. However, where igneous (crystalline) rocks have been faulted, slip tends to be much more localized within narrow fault cores comprising cataclastic rocks. Combining our new data with previous research results, we infer that four main movement phases have occurred on the fault: (1) Late Cretaceous sinistral slip faulting with a component of extensional deformation, under a regime of NW-SE compression; (2) late Paleogene intense dextral slip faulting, which occurred under a regional NE-SW compressional regime; (3) middle Miocene weak sinistral slip faulting, during NNW-SSE compression; and (4) local Quaternary dextral slip faulting with a reverse component, under ENE-WSW to E-W compression. The most intense phase of deformation appears to have occurred during the late Paleogene due to a major reorganization of plate motion in and around the NW Pacific area. Our findings highlight that the fault has been a preferred zone of weakness for episodic reactivations having significant implications for the changing tectonic environments of East Asia from Late Cretaceous to Quaternary, and that its segments underwent distinguishable deformations at each phase probably due to their geometrical features and fault rock properties.

AB The late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic Indosinian Orogeny in Southeast Asia was characterized by subduction in the Paleo-Tethys and collisions among continental blocks and fragments. The Khorat Plateau Basin in northeastern Thailand covers much of the Indochina Block and was subjected to complex tectonic activity during the late Paleozoic and Mesozoic. The Mesozoic sequence of the basin comprises thick, gently folded non-marine sediments that include red beds and is separated from the underlying upper Paleozoic sequence by the major angular unconformity of the Permo-Triassic boundary, which we refer to as the "Indosinian I event" in the Khorat Plateau Basin. Seismic and well data acquired for oil and gas exploration indicate that the upper Paleozoic sequence is heavily faulted and structurally complex. Our study showed that in some areas about 2000 m of the upper Paleozoic sequence has been eroded at the Indosinian I unconformity, although thicknesses of up to similar to 6000 m of upper Paleozoic rocks remain in some areas. Previous interpretations of oil and gas exploration data attribute the erosional event to back-arc closure due to collision of the Indochina and Sibumasu blocks during subduction in the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. However, our detailed structural mapping indicated that the Indosinian I unconformity was a consequence of the collision of the Indochina and South China blocks during the late Permian to Middle Triassic. We propose that this collision initiated the Indosinian Orogeny in mainland Southeast Asia.

AB Ionospheric disturbances induced by various natural (e.g., earthquakes, volcanic eruption, thunderstorms, meteorite showers, solar eclipses) or anthropogenic (e.g., nuclear explosions, launching of space shuttles) processes can be detected through change in Total Electron Content (TEC) in the F-layer. These ionospheric perturbations can be captured by worldwide expanding geodetic (GNSS) networks, mainly during the day time, when the solar radiation ionizes the air molecules. However, during post-sunset period, strong ionospheric irregularities (known as Equatorial Plasma Bubbles, EPBs) develop due to the classical configuration for the Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) instability that diffracts navigation and communication signals. Here we use various instances of ionospheric disturbances triggered by natural processes (e.g., earthquakes and volcanic eruption), in the recent decade to investigate the spatiotemporal and seasonal effects of ionospheric irregularities on the GNSS signals. Our study suggests that in the low-latitudinal region (e.g., Sumatra, Mexico), such ionospheric irregularities can mask the ionospheric perturbations due to the higher production rate of EPBs. Hence detection of such co-seismic TEC anomaly becomes difficult. However, in the high-latitudinal region (e.g., Iceland, Alaska), due to the lower production rate of EPBs, ambient ionospheric irregularities are insignificant and hence coseismic TEC anomalies can be captured even during night time. We argue that the production rate of EPBs further depends upon seasonal and longitudinal parameters on the globe.
