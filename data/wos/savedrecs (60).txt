AB The iron-free and iron-bearing (Np, Pu)-containing sodium-aluminum-phosphate glass samples were studied by X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Oxidation states of neptunium, plutonium and iron, and elemental composition of the surfaces of the samples studied were determined. In both iron-free and iron-bearing glasses Np is present predominantly as Np(V) on the surface and Np(IV) in the bulk. Pu(III) dominates over Pu(IV)/(V) in the iron-free glass while oxidized forms of Pu prevail in the iron-bearing glass.

AB Binary SiO2-MgO oxide systems were synthesized by the sol-gel method and self-combustion method with no addition of water to the starting reaction system, using three types of precursors. The series of SiO2-MgO samples of Si to Mg molar ratios of: 1:0.0, 1:0.1, 1:0.5, 1:1.0, 1:2.0 were characterized by TGA, XRPD, low-temperature nitrogen adsorption and TPD methods. Changes in structural parameters and surface properties caused by modification of silica with amorphous magnesium oxide were identified. High thermal stability of the amorphous oxide systems was evidenced by XRPD measurements, while the results obtained by TPD revealed that modification of weakly acidic SiO2 gel surface with MgO changed its surface character into basic. According to the results of textural analysis, the mesoporous binary oxides obtained showed large surface area and mono modal pore distribution (in the majority of samples) irrespective of the method of synthesis. Furthermore, the CO2 sorption properties of the sorbents were investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) at room temperature.

AB In understanding the influence of rare earth ions on crystallization, metal ions distribution, crack propagation and corrosion resistance of tailing-derived glass-ceramics, CeO2 containing glass-ceramics were prepared by melting method. Decrease of degree of crystallization of glass-ceramics with the increase of CeO2 content was maintained by the intensified stabilization of glass structure owing to the high electric field characteristics of Ce4+. A significant change in metal ions distribution can be observed in glass-ceramics with the increase of CeO2 content, which can result in the formation of aggregates. The aggregation induced by rare earth doping had a certain inhibiting effect on the propagation of cracks. In addition, the acid-resistance of glass-ceramics had been improved. The densification of the glass phase induced by the high field of Ce4+ was beneficial to the performance improvement.

AB Strontium aluminoborate glasses with different concentrations of Ce (0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.5 mol%) were synthesized by the conventional melt-quenching technique. After the synthesis, photoluminescence (PL), scintillation and dosimetric properties of the samples were evaluated systematically. In the photoluminescence and scintillation spectra, a sharp peak around 370 nm due to the 5d-4f transitions of Ce was observed. The 0.05% Ce-doped sample showed the highest intensity in PL and scintillation among the samples investigated. The 0.01-0.1% Ce-doped samples also showed thermally-stimulated luminescence (TSL) with a glow peak of around 90 degrees C after X-ray irradiation. The TSL response of 0.01-0.05% Ce-doped samples increased monotonically with X-ray dose over a dose range of 10(-1)-10(4) mGy.

AB Gold nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in sodium antimony borate glass system were fabricated and their optical, physical, structural, ultrafast nonlinear optical properties were studied and analyzed. Metallic gold NPs were synthesized using thermal reducing agent Sb2O3 and demonstrated the reduction mechanism of Au3+/Au+ -> Au-o by using reduction potentials of corresponding redox system. UV-Visible spectroscopy measurements have revealed the characteristic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of Au NPs at similar to 565 rim, attributed due to interband transition. The micrographs of High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) confirmed the existence of uniformly distributed spherical shaped Au NPs with particle sizes in the 8-45 nm range with an average particle size of 25 rim. The ultrafast nonlinear optical properties of gold doped glasses were investigated using the Z-scan technique at a non-resonant wavelength (lambda = 800 nm, 80 MHz repetition rate) with femtosecond (fs) Ti:sapphire laser pulses. Z-scan measurements of undoped glass depicted are verse saturable absorption (RSA) type of nonlinearity whereas the gold-doped glass demonstrated saturable absorption (SA) kind of nonlinearity due to intraband (sp -> sp) transitions. The Z-scan data demonstrated that the investigated glasses are potential materials for the applications in nonlinear optics devices, particularly in optical switching devices.

AB Green Solid Polymer Electrolytes (SPEs) containing Er3+ ions have been prepared by solvent casting process. Chitosan was used as host polymer and the trivalent cations, as erbium triflate (Er(CF3SO3)(3)), have been incorporated into the matrix. The thermogravimetric analysis was used to evaluate the thermal stability of the electrolytes and the minimum onset decomposition temperature was 139 degrees C. Morphology analysis have revealed the predominant amorphous character of the analysed samples. Complex Impedance Spectroscopy was used to evaluate the conductivity of the samples as a function of temperature. The most conducting electrolyte had higher amount of glycerol (CS(ErTrif)(0.05)GlY(0.70)) and displayed 2.06 x 10(-5) and 5.91 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 30 degrees C and 90 degrees C, respectively. This SPE was chosen to assemble a small electrochromic device with glass/ITO/PB/CS (ErTrif)(0.05)GlY(0.70)/CeO2-TiO2/ITO/glass configuration, which behaviour was studied by cyclic voltammetry and transmittance.

AB Nanolaminates consisting of individual amorphous Cu-Zr-Al layers and nanocrystalline Cu layers on Si substrates were prepared by alternatively magnetron sputtering and hardness measurements were conducted upon nanoindentation with a standard Berkovich indenter. Indentation hardness showed a strong size effect in single Cu-Zr-Al film, its decline trend was slower in the nanolaminates with thinner amorphous layers. While experimental hardness was obviously below the expected rule-of-mixture value for all the nanolaminates. Finite element modelling (FEM) analysis was performed in each sample to explore stress distribution beneath indenter. A higher proportion of Cu layers has been involved into plastic region than the nominal value. Besides, interfacial barrier strength was estimated for each sample. The experimental results could be well described by the modified rule of mixture integrated with true ratio of Cu to Cu-Zr-Al in plastic region and the interface strengthen effect.

The results show that Cr substitution for Mo to the alloy system can remarkably increase the glass forming ability (GFA) and magnetic properties, but decrease the thermal stability and hardness. The glassy sample exhibit certain magnetic properties, the saturation magnetization (M-s) of as-annealed sample can reach up to 123.6 A.m(2).kg(-1) by selecting proper annealing process. In addition, this alloy shows high hardness and high bending ductility.

ID FABRICATION
AB Porous silver spheres were successfully prepared by reducing silver-ammonia solution and using rape pollen as novel bio-templates. The synthesized porous silver spheres with diameter of 50 mu m have nanoparticles of ca. 25 nm. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and transmission electron microscope (TEM) techniques. The thermal and electrical properties were also studied. We find that the reaction temperature and AgNO3 concentration have important influence on the morphology and electrical properties of the final products. TEM observations showed that the as-synthesized products are composed of nanoparticles with size around 25 nm. Volume resistivity results revealed that the volume resistivity was decreased with increasing the amount of AgNO3 concentration. The volume resistivity of porous silver was decreased two orders of magnitude while the AgNO3 increased twice. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we prepared highly porous polyamide (PA) monolith in a continuous and scalable solution foaming process. The created materials, displaying a structure with both open and closed pores, had oils or organic solvents uptake capacities ranging from about 4.8 to 10.7 g/g. Moreover, they had sorption retention higher than 96% after 10 cycling tests because the structures of pores were not broken during the adsorption process. On the other hand, they absorbed oils and organic solvents rapidly and reached saturation in 30 s. A great promising way was provided to fabricate highly porous PA for the cleanup of large-scale oil or organic solvent spills. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Well-dispersed TiO2/ZrO2 nanofibers-doped activated carbon (AC/TiZr) were successfully synthesized as an electrode for the capacitive deionization (CDI) technique via electrospinning that was followed by a hydrothermal treatment. SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS and EDX measurements were employed to characterize the morphology, crystal structure and chemistry composition of the as-synthesized material. The electro-chemical performance of the AC/TiZr nanocomposite modified electrode was measured using systematic cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments. The highest specific capacitance for the AC/TiZr-based electrode is 251.3 Fg/g, which is higher than those of the AC (207.4 Fg/g) and TiO2/ZrO2 NFs (0.4 Fg/g)-based electrodes, and the interior resistance was also reduced. A desalination performance enhancement was obtained in the case of the AC/TiZr and the electrosorptive is 2.96 mg g(-1). The implementation of the AC/TiZr nanocomposite provided a high potential for improving the efficiency of CDI. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; BEHAVIOR; COATINGS
AB Bioactive glasses, and in particular the "gold standard" 45S5 Bioglass (R) (45S5), are employed in medical practice by virtue of their ability to bond to bone. However, the tendency to crystallize of such systems during thermal treatments, which are necessary in several processing routes, is among the reasons that prevent a broader use of these materials. Here a novel bioglass composition (BGMS10), containing strontium and magnesium and a low content of alkali oxides, is presented. Compared to 45S5, the BGMS10 is characterized by a remarkably higher crystallization temperature (932 degrees C), larger processing window and it can be sintered at lower temperature (737 degrees C), thus maintaining its amorphous nature and pronounced bioactivity, as confirmed by in vitro tests. For these reasons, BGMS10 is a great candidate for the realization of specific products which require a thermal treatment, such as scaffolds for bone repair, composites and bioactive coatings.

AB Cu-ZrO2 nanocomposites were prepared by an in situ reactive synthesis of copper nitrate Cu(NO3)(2) and zirconium oxychloride (ZrOCl2). The produced composites were evaluated in terms of their morphology, structural analysis, thermal conductivity and microhardness. The results showed that ZrO2 nanoparticles with about 45 nm were homogeneously distributed in the copper matrix. The measured thermal conductivity for the Cu-ZrO2 nanocomposites decreased from 370.8 to 101.3 W/mK with increasing ZrO2 content from 0 to 9 wt%. The microhardness of the Cu-ZrO2 nanocomposites increase as the ZrO2 content increases. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Vertically aligned crystalline SnS layers were applied for the high-performing near-infrared (NIR) photodetector. Sputtering method was used to align the vertical SnS layers with an interlayer space of 0.56 nm on a large-scale Si substrate. Raman and XPS analyses confirmed the quality of SnS layers. Under NIR illumination, the SnS/Si photodetector showed the ultra-fast photoresponses (rise time of similar to 12 mu s and fall time of similar to 42 mu s) without an external bias. Due to the effect of the pyro-phototronic potential, high-performing photodetectivity was achieved to be 4.2 x 10(14) Jones. This excellent performance was attributed to the photon-induced pyroelectric effect in the vertically grown SnS layers. This novel approach of 2-dimensitonal material will open a new possibility to design ultra-performing photoelectric devices, including photodetectors and solar energy devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V.

AB A high performance electrode material for supercapacitors is achieved by incorporating 20-30 nm Ni (OH)(2) nanoflakes into a highly porous CNT/rGO hybrid framework. The Ni(OH)(2)/CNT/rGO nanocomposite delivers a high specific capacitance of 633 F g (-1) at 1 A g(-1) based on the total mass of the composite, implying favorable charge transfer reactions. Even at 10 A g(-1), 65% of the capacitance can be retained, demonstrating impressive high-rate performance. Remarkable cyclic performance was also delivered, with capacitance retention of 80% after 3000 cycles at 2 A g(-1). The remarkable power capability and cycle stability was attributed to the rational design, homogenous microstructure and consequent synergistic effect generated in the composite. The simple and scalable one-pot synthesis procedure can be extended to fabrication of other high performance energy storage materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; ALLOY; MICROSTRUCTURE
AB In this study, a new rolling method, wave-shaped interface rolling (WIR), was proposed to tailor the strong basal texture of a hot-rolled Mg AZ31 plate. Microstructure and texture of the WIRed and annealed plate were investigated and the mechanism for texture variation was discussed. The results show that the waved interface can effectively rotate the basal poles away from the normal direction toward the rolling direction at both the regions near and far from the waved interface. Different inclination angles of h0002i away from the normal direction occur at different regions in the rolled plates and a maximum inclination around 30 degrees can be obtained.

AB This communication reports a pioneering study on the synthesis and properties of CeO2/SnS2 composite. CeO2/SnS2 heterojunction was synthesized via the hydrothermal reactions of SnCl4 center dot 5H(2)O and thioacetamide in the presence of CeO2 nanoparticles at 170 degrees C for 12 h. The composition, structure, and optical properties of the as-synthesized CeO2/SnS2 heterojunction were characterized by X-ray diffraction, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra and photoluminescence spectra. The photocatalytic properties of the as-synthesized CeO2/SnS2 heterojunction were evaluated in the reduction of aqueous Cr(VI) under visible-light (k > 42 0 nm) irradiation, and compared with those of SnS2, CeO2, and CeO2/SnS2 nanocomposite prepared by physical mixing method (CeO2/SnS2-PM). The results demonstrated that the as-synthesized CeO2/SnS2 heterojunction had exceptionally higher visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity than SnS2, CeO2, and CeO2/SnS2-PM. The possible reasons underlying the photocatalytic results were proposed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Polyvinyl alcohol/silica (PVA/SiO2) hybrid fibers were prepared via a sol-gel combined electrospinning technique, and their potential application in bone tissue engineering was evaluated in terms of in vitro bioactivity. When the PVA concentration was 8%, the obtained PVA/SiO2 hybrid fibers exhibited a uniform and continuous morphology, with an average fiber diameter of about 542.9 nm. The SiO2 xerogel phase was uniformly distributed within the PVA matrix, and its actual content was very close to the theoretical value. After 3 days of immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF), the PVA/SiO2 hybrid fibers displayed a vigorous precipitation of lamellar apatite crystals, reflecting their excellent in vitro bioactivity.

AB The selection of Low-e coated glass in the mid-latitude region has been a difficult subject. In this paper, a simple sol-gel method can be used to control the grain size of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) nanocrystalline films by introducing complex chelating agents into the sols and controlling their contents. The film is a polycrystalline film with rutile structure. Through the electrochemical doping technology, the localized surface plasmonic electrochromism of FTO nanocrystals in the near infrared region (NIR) can be achieved, and the optical contrast at 1750 nm can reach 60%. The Low-e glass coated with this film can adjust dynamically the transmittance of NIR light according to people's feelings, realize the effective control of the solar radiation heat through windows without affecting the daylight use at work time, and is suitable for using in mid-latitude zone.

AB Ag nanocrystals (AgNCs) decorated g-C3N4/Nafion hybrid membranes were synthesized by one-step method. And the nanostructures of as-prepared samples were characterized and analyzed by diverse techniques. The results indicated that AgNCs sized 4-5 nm were highly dispersed on the surface of g-C3N4/Nafion hybrid membranes, which can achieve stronger visible light absorption and higher charge separation efficiency. Due to the synergy effect, AgNCs decorated g-C3N4/Nafion hybrid membranes had excellent photocatalytic activity and good recycling stability in the degradation of Rhodamine B under visible-light irradiation. The possible photocatalytic mechanism of AgNCs decorated g-C3N4/Nafion hybrid membranes was tentatively proposed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The red-emitting Na2Ca2Si3O9: Eu3+ phosphors were synthesized by a sol-gel method. The phase, morphology, photoluminescence properties of the phosphors were well characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and photoluminescence (PL) spectra, respectively. XRD confirmed the material phase as Eu3+-doped Na2Ca2Si3O9. The phosphors can be efficiently excited by near UV light to realize an intense red luminescence (613 nm) corresponding to the electric dipole transition D-5(0) -> F-7(2) of Eu3+ ions. The lifetimes of the phosphors were calculated for various concentrations of Eu3+ ions in Na2Ca2Si3O9. The CIE chromaticity coordinates of the phosphors were calculated and located in the red region.

AB The high humidity response of the sol-gel-synthesized ZnFe2O4 films was discovered, which was characterized through the relative humidity (RH) influence on the electric parameters of capacitance, impedance and resistance. As the RH increased from 30% to 90%, both the impedance and resistance of the ZnFe2O4 films, decreased by similar to 2-3 orders of magnitude. This might be due to the physical adsorption and polarization of water molecules on the ZnFe2O4 surface. The high humidity response of ZnFe2O4 films has potential application in humidity sensitive devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO MATERIALS LETTERS

ID NEAR-FIELD; METAMATERIALS
AB The composites with negative permittivity have drawn intensive attentions due to their promising candidates for double negative materials (DNMs). In this work, dielectric properties of the carbon nanotubes/yttrium iron garnet (CNTs/YIG) composites with different CNTs content have been researched in radio frequency. When CNTs content exceeds percolation threshold, the CNTs interconnect with each other and form conductive networks. Then the negative permittivity is obtained and can be attributed to the motion of charge carriers along the CNTs networks in the CNTs/YIG composites. In addition, with CNTs content raising, the gradually electron densities result in effective adjustment of negative permittivity in different frequency ranges. Therefore, the CNTs/YIG composites with tunable negative permittivity have great potential to be DNMs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The internal microstructure of the composites was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy and microhardness variations were determined, showing that both matrices and fibers have hardness values that are independent of geometrical features. This verification is of special interest for the production of SiC/SiC composite structures with more complicated geometries for prospective nuclear applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Practical application of nano/micro-composite is frequently hampered by the sophisticated fabrication process, expensive cost and easy loss of capacities due to hydrophilicity etc. This paper presents a facile method to fabricate a novel superhydrophobic nano-aluminum/copper (II) oxide composite via electrophoretic deposition (EPD) and followed by surface chemical modification using a low surface energy material-1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane. The stable EPD suspension consists of ethanol and acetyl-acetone. Surface morphology, wettability, and chemical composition were characterized using SEM, EDS, XRD, water contact and sliding angle measurements. The resulting surface, with water contact angle of similar to 168 degrees, is stable up to 12 months in ambient atmosphere and shows great exothermic performance. These results provide a new perspective for advancement of superhydrophobic surfaces in real industrial application. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Self-supported 3D Mo doped WP2 nanowire arrays on carbon fiber paper (Mo-WP2 NWs/CFP) is prepared as an efficient monolithic electrode for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The results indicate that the electrocatalytic performance can be significantly improved via doping. The sample with the Mo: W mole ratio of 5% only needs overpotential of 96 mV to afford the current density of 10 mA cm (2) with a small Tafel slop of 48 mV dec (1), which displays the best HER catalytic activity ever reported among the tungsten phosphides. The Mo doping enhances the electronic conductivity, increases the electrochemical active surface area and modifies the binding energies of P in the WP2, which notably improves its HER activities and develops it as a promising catalyst for energy storage and conversion.

AB Novel Cu1.96S/g-C3N4 0D/2D p-n heterojunctions were successfully synthesized via a facile one-step calcination approach using thiocarbamide as both precursor and sulfur source. The Cu1.96S nanoparticles with sizes of 3-10 nm were closely anchored on the surface of g-C3N4 with good dispersion and the Cu1.96S/g-C3N4 nanocomposites were used as a photocatalyst for photodegradation of ciprofloxacin (CIP) under visible light. The experimental results demonstrated that the visible light photocatalytic activity of the Cu1.96S/g-C3N4 0D/2D p-n heterojunction was significantly enhanced in comparison with pure g-C3N4 and the degradation rate was up to about 3.2 times that of pure g-C3N4. The increased photocatalytic activity of the Cu1.96S/g-C3N4 nanocomposites could be attributed to the formation of the heterojunctions between g-C3N4 and Cu1.96S, which were conducive to avert the aggregation of small Cu1.96S nanoparticles and suppresses the recombination of photoinduced charge. Moreover, the Cu1.96S/g-C3N4 photocatalyst exhibited high stability for CIP degradation even after seven successive cycles. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Additive manufacturing of copper and steel gradient materials by electron beam freeform fabrication is a novel exploration. T2 copper was deposited on AISI-304 stainless steel in the experiment and the gradient depositions were obtained successfully. The results showed that the distribution of iron element was more uniform with the increase of copper layers. No iron-rich a phase could be found when the number of copper layer was greater than three. The supersaturated epsilon phases precipitated in globular a phases while there was no e phase found in dendritic one. FeCu4 metastable phases were found in the depositions duo to low cooling rate and ordering transformation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Microstructure, mechanical properties and corrosion behavior of a novel Al-8Si-Fe alloy fabricated by Rheo-HPDC were investigated. Compared with the HPDC alloy, the microstructure (alpha(1)/alpha(2)-Al, Si and beta-Al5FeSi phases) of the alloy was greatly refined by Rheo-HPDC. The Rheo-HPDC alloy showed improved mechanical properties and thermal conductivity to those prepared by HPDC, and the increasing rates of UTS, YS, elongation, hardness and thermal conductivity were 31%, 19%, 59%, 12% and 10%, respectively. Rheo-HPDC Al-8Si-Fe alloy also indicated a significant improvement in corrosion resistance as demonstrated by the results of immersion, electrochemical and scanning kelvin probe (SCP) tests.

AB The clinic application of magnesium is mainly impeded by its poor corrosion resistance and implants with localized drug delivery attract tremendous interest. Here, Mg/Al layered double hydroxide (Mg-Al LDH) film was in situ prepared on AZ31 alloy by a hydrothermal process, and further calcined to form metastable mixed oxides, also named Mg/Al layered double oxide (LDO). Finally, immersing in 5Fluorouracil (5-FU) solution, Mg/Al LDO would revert to Mg/Al LDH via a memory effect, and be loaded with 5-FU (#LDO-5FU). Comparing to AZ31 alloy, the corrosion resistance of the as-prepared #LDO-5FU sample was enhanced. The amount of released 5-FU from # LDO-5FU sample was similar to 993 ng/cm(2). The proliferation of human cholangiocarcinoma cell (RBE) was effectively inhibited on the surface of # LDO-5FU sample owing to the release of 5-FU. This work broadens the application of calcined LDH and provides a new strategy in the field of surface modification of magnesium alloy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Graphene/zinc oxide nanowires/graphene (G/ZnO NWs/G) sandwich composites were firstly synthesized on nickel foam by electrostatic spray deposition technique and hydrothermal reaction in sequence. Microstructure and chemical analysis showed the dense and uniform ZnO NWs encapsulated by bottom and upper graphene layers. The G/ZnO NWs/G composites as cold cathodes for field emission (FE) exhibited improved performances with a lower turn-on electric field of 7.45 V/mu m, a higher field enhancement factor of 5328 and higher emission current stability over 10 h than G/ZnO NWs. The enhanced FE properties of G/ZnO NWs/G were mainly attributed to its sandwich structure, which introduced more surface defects and numerous emission sites, simultaneously decreased the work function and resistivity of emitters. This investigation paves a new way for developing high-performance cold cathode FE materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Taenia multiceps is a tapeworm that leads to the death of livestock, resulting in major economic losses worldwide. The adult stage of this parasite invades the small intestine of dogs and other canids. In the present study, we developed a direct PCR assay to detect T. multiceps eggs isolated from dog feces to help curb further outbreaks. The genomic DNA was rapidly released using a lysis buffer and the PCR reaction was developed to amplify a 433-bp fragment of the T. multiceps mitochondrial gene encoding NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (nad5) from eggs isolated from dog feces. The procedure could be completed within 3 h, including flotation. The sensitivity of the assay was determined by detecting DNA from defined numbers of eggs, and the specificity was determined by detecting DNA from other intestinal tapeworm and roundworm species that commonly infect dogs. In addition, 14 taeniid-positive fecal samples determined by the flotation technique were collected and further evaluated by the regular PCR and our direct PCR. The results showed that the direct PCR developed herein was sensitive enough to detect the DNA from as few as 10 T. multiceps eggs and that no cross-reactions with other tapeworm and roundworm were observed, suggesting its high sensitivity and specificity for T. multiceps detection. Moreover, 14 taeniid-positive samples were screened by the regular PCR and direct PCR, with detection rates of 78.6% and 85.7%, respectively. In conclusion, the direct PCR assay developed in the present study has high sensitivity and specificity to identify T. multiceps eggs isolated from dog feces and therefore could represent an invaluable tool to identify T. multiceps outbreaks and would contribute to future clinical applications.

AB Wild vertebrates are involved in the transmission cycles of numerous pathogens. Additionally, they can affect the abundance of arthropod vectors. Urbanization, landscape and climate changes, and the adaptation of vectors and wildlife to human habitats represent complex and evolving scenarios, which affect the interface of vector, wildlife and human populations, frequently with a consequent increase in zoonotic risk. While considerable attention has focused on these interrelations with regard to certain major vector-borne pathogens such as Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. and tick-borne encephalitis virus, information regarding many other zoonotic pathogens is more dispersed. In this review, we discuss the possible role of wildlife in the maintenance and spread of some of these neglected zoonoses in Europe. We present case studies on the role of rodents in the cycles of Bartonella spp., of wild ungulates in the cycle of Babesia spp., and of various wildlife species in the life cycle of Leishmania infantum, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Rickettsia spp.
   These examples highlight the usefulness of surveillance strategies focused on neglected zoonotic agents in wildlife as a source of valuable information for health professionals, nature managers and (local) decision makers. These benefits could be further enhanced by increased collaboration between researchers and stakeholders across Europe and a more harmonised and coordinated approach for data collection.

AB Vector-borne pathogens have developed a close relationship with blood feeding arthropod ectoparasites (e.g., mosquitoes, ticks, phlebotomine sand flies, black flies, fleas, kissing bugs, lice) and exploited a huge variety of vector transmission routes. Therefore, the life cycles of these pathogens result in a long evolved balance with the respective arthropod biology, ecology and blood feeding habits, instrumentally to the infection of several animal species, including humans. Amongst the many parasite transmission modes, such as ingestion of the arthropod, with its faeces or secretions, blood feeding represents the main focus for this article, as it is a central event to the life of almost all arthropod vectors. The time frame in which pathogens are transmitted to any animal host is governed by a large number of biological variables related to the vector, the pathogen, the host and environmental factors. Scientific data available on transmission times for each pathogen are discussed relative to their impact for the success of vector-borne disease control strategies. Blocking pathogen transmission, and thus preventing the infection of dogs and cats, may be achievable by the use of chemical compounds if they are characterised by a fast onset of killing activity or repellence against arthropods. The fast speed of kill exerted by systemic isoxazoline, as well as the repellent effect of pyrethroids have renewed the interest of the scientific community and pharmaceutical companies towards reducing the burden of vector-borne diseases under field conditions. However, endosymbionts and vaccines targeting arthropods or pathogen antigens should be further investigated as alternative strategies towards the goal of achieving an effective integrated control of vector borne diseases.

AB Human alveolar echinococcosis is caused by the fox tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis and is usually fatal if left untreated. Medical treatment with albendazole (ABZ) remains an effective option. However, due to its low aqueous solubility, ABZ is poorly and erratically absorbed following oral administration resulting in low drug levels in plasma and liver distribution. Thus, there arises the need to find a simple, efficient and scalable method to produce new ABZ formulations with increased bioavailability. Bearing this in mind, ABZ nanocrystals (ABZ-NCs) appears to be a useful tool to achieve this goal. The aim of the current study was to investigate the chemoprophylactic and clinical efficacy of an ABZ-NC formulation on mice infected with E. multilocularis. In the chemoprophylactic efficacy study, mean weight of the cysts recovered from the ABZ-NC group was 50% lower than that recorded from untreated mice, whereas the treatment with ABZ suspension did not show preventive effect. The viability of protoscoleces isolated from ABZ-NC treated mice was significantly lower than control groups. In the clinical efficacy studies, both ABZ formulations resulted in a reduction in the mean weight of the cysts obtained from mice, however only the treatment with the nanosuspension revealed significant differences (P < 0.05) compared to the control groups. Treatment with ABZ-NCs reduced the weight of the cysts by 77% and the viability of their protoscoleces to 34%. All these results coincided with the tissue damage determined at the ultrastructural level. The enhanced chemoprophylactic and clinical efficacy of ABZ-NCs observed in this study could be attributed to an increase in the oral bioavailability of the drug. In a next step, we will characterize the cyst concentration profile after the administration of ABZ-NCs in mice infected with E. multilocularis.

AB Fasciolosis due to infection with Fasciola hepatica: Fasciola gigantica or their hybrids is a significant global cause of livestock production loss. Infection is commonly diagnosed by a labour-intensive sedimentation and faecal egg count (FEC), which has limited throughput and is only applicable after completion of the 8-12 week pre-patent period (PPP). A commercially-available ELISA for the detection of coprological antigen (coproELISA) enables detection prior to the completion of the PPP and is suitable for diagnosis of larger sample sizes, although the sensitivity reported under experimental infection settings can be difficult to replicate in the field, particularly in cattle. A recently-published real-time PCR workflow for the sensitive detection of Fasciola spp. DNA in faecal samples provides increased sample throughput, although the point at which this technique is first able to diagnose infection remains unknown. Other tools for the molecular diagnosis of fasciolosis, such as conventional PCR and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), have been shown to detect F. hepatica DNA as early as 1 week post infection (WPI). In this study, faecal samples were collected weekly from 10 experimentally-infected Merino lambs and subjected to diagnosis via traditional sedimentation, coproELISA and real-time PCR. Samples were first considered positive at 6-8 WPI by coproELISA, real-time PCR and sedimentation, respectively. At 9 WPI 100% of samples were positive by all three methods. To evaluate the capacity of the real-time PCR approach to detect infection prior to completion of the PPP, two methods of sample preparation were compared at 2 WPI: (i) 150 mg raw faecal samples and (ii) 3 g faecal starting volume prior to sedimentation and pelleting. Neither method of sample preparation yielded positive results at 2 WPI suggesting that DNA amplification by real-time PCR is associated with faecal egg load.

AB A molecular tool described here allows in one step for specific discrimination among three cryptic freshwater snail species (genus Galba) involved in fasciolosis transmission, a worldwide infectious disease of humans and livestock. The multiplex PCR approach taken targets for each species a distinctive, known microsatellite locus which is amplified using specific primers designed to generate an amplicon of a distinctive size that can be readily separated from the amplicons of the other two species on an agarose gel. In this way, the three Galba species (G. cubensis, G. schirazensis, and G. truncatula) can be differentiated from one another, including even if DNA from all three were present in the same reaction. The accuracy of this new molecular tool was tested and validated by comparing multiplex PCR results with species identification based on sequences at mitochondrial and nuclear markers. This new method is accurate, inexpensive, simple, rapid, and can be adapted to handle large sample sizes. It will be helpful for monitoring invasion of Galba species and for developing strategies to limit the snail species involved in the emergence or re-emergence of fasciolosis.

AB Sarcoptic mange is a globally significant parasitic disease of humans and other animals, both domestic and wild. But clinical diagnosis of S. scabiei infestation, using the standard skin scraping followed by microscopy technique, remains highly variable (predominantly due to false-negatives), and a major challenge for human and animal welfare. Here, we utilised a unique sample set from bare-nosed wombats (Vombatus ursinus) to evaluate a variety of putatively useful diagnostic approaches for S. scabiei. Against the standard of skin scrapings followed by microscopy, we compared observational scoring of mange severity (often employed in field studies of wildlife), PCR on skin scrapings (recently proposed as an improvement for humans and other animals), and PCR on skin swabs (proposed a non-invasive method for humans and other animals). We find that observational scoring positively correlated with counts of S. scabiei from skin scrapings, particularly as mange severity increases, but underdiagnoses early mange. Species-specific PCR for S. scabiei on skin scrapings had enhanced capacity for mite detection relative to microscopy. Finally, the non-invasive sampling method of PCR on skin swab samples had a high congruence to skin scraping microscopy, however prospective false negatives as a consequence to sampling is concerning. To our knowledge, this is the first study to simultaneously assess this combination of methods for S. scabiei diagnosis. We conclude that PCR on skin scrapings as an advancement on traditional microscopy, and the other techniques (observational, skin swabs and microscopy) remain useful, but harbour greater false-negatives. Outcomes are transferrable to diagnosis of S. scabiei for other host species, including humans, particularly for crusted mange and potentially ordinary mange also.

AB Cats are definitive hosts and reservoirs for several parasites, some of which are responsible for serious zoonotic diseases. We conducted a case-control study of data from a trap-neuter-return (TNR) programme (years 2014-2017) designed to examine the prevalence of zoonotic parasites in free-roaming cats living in urban areas of central Spain. In the animal population tested (n = 263), we detected a 29.2% prevalence of endoparasites, including high rates of cestodes (12.9%) and Toxocara cad (11.7%). While faecal samples showed no Toxoplasma gondii oocysts, the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection was 24.2%. Antibodies to Leishmania infantum were detected in 4.8% of the animals, though all skin and blood samples analyzed were PCR negative for this parasite. Ectoparasites (ticks and fleas) were found in 4.6% of the cat population, and 10.6% of the cats were detected with Otodectes cynotis. Finally, 6.3% and 7.9% cats tested positive for feline leukaemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus, respectively. Our study provides useful information for animal-welfare and public-health, as the parasites detected can affect native wild animals through predation, competition and disease transmission. Our detection of zoonotic parasites such as L. infantum, T. gondii, T. cad, Giardia duodenalis and several ectoparasites prompts an urgent need for health control measures in stray cats.

AB We report Taenia ovis infection in Danish sheep for the first time. In spring 2016, the metacestode stage of T. ovis was at slaughter observed in heart muscles, diaphragm and skeletal muscles from approx. a third of all sheep from one specific farm localised in South Jutland. The diagnosis was confirmed by molecular typing of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (cox1) gene. Three newly imported dogs were suspected but the definitive host was unidentifiable. The finding is not regulated in the meat control procedures. However, infected meat is usually condemned due to aesthetic reasons causing economic losses. Thus, finding of T. ovis is of concern to sheep meat producers in the area, as the infection could have spread further on to other farms.

AB This study was designed to investigate the ability of two herbal extracts and different chemical substances to inhibit or disrupt sporulation of Eimeria species oocysts of the chickens. The two herbal extracts were Allium sativum (garlic) and Moringa olifiera while the chemical substances included commercial disinfectants and diclazuril. Field isolates of Eimeria oocysts were propagated in chickens to obtain a continuous source of oocysts. The collected unsporulated oocysts (10(5)oocysts/5 ml) were dispensed into 5 cm Petri dish. Three replicates were used for each treatment. The treated oocysts were incubated for 48 h at 25-29 degrees C and 80% relative humidity. The results showed that herbal extracts, the commercial recommended dose of Dettol, TH4, Phenol, Virkon (R) S, and Diclazuril 20% have no effect on the sporulation. While Sodium hypochlorite showed a significant degree of sporulation inhibition reached to 49.67%. Moreover, 70% ethanol, and 10% formalin showed 100% sporulation inhibition. It was concluded that 70% ethanol and 10% formalin are the most effective methods to inhibit Eimeria species sporulation.

AB Intestinal infection by the zoonotic protozoan, Cryptosporidium parvum, causes significant alterations in the gene expression profile in host epithelial cells. The molecular mechanisms of how C. parvum may modulate host cell gene transcription and the pathological significance of such alterations are largely unclear. Previous studies demonstrate that a panel of parasite RNA transcripts are delivered into infected host cells and may modulate host gene transcription. Using in vitro models of intestinal cryptosporidiosis, in this study, we analyzed the impact of host delivery of C. parvum Cdg2_FLc_0220 RNA transcript on host gene expression profile. We found that alterations in host gene expression profile following C. parvum infection were partially associated with the nuclear delivery of Cdg2_FLc_0220. Specifically, we identified a total of 46 overlapping upregulated genes and 8 overlapping downregulated genes in infected cells and cells transfected with Full-Cdg2_FLc_0220. Trans-suppression of the DAZ interacting zinc finger protein 1 like (DZIP1L) gene, the top overlapping downregulated gene in host cells following C. parvum infection and cells transfected with Full-Cdg2_FLc_0220, was mediated by G9a, independent of PRDM1. Cdg2_FLc_0220-mediated trans-suppression of the DZIPIL gene was independent of H3K9 and H3K27 methylation. Data from this study provide additional evidence that delivery of C. parvum Cdg2_FLc_0220 RNA transcript in infected epithelial cells modulates the transcription of host genes, contributing to the alterations in the gene expression profile in host epithelial cells during C. parvum infection.

AB The aim of this study was to characterize the extracts and fractions of Persea americana Mill. (Avocado) seeds and to determine the composition and the in vitro anthelmintic activity against third-stage larvae (L3) of Haemonchus conforms. The fresh (F) and dried (H) avocado seeds (PA) were subjected to extraction with hot water (W-PAF, W-PAH), ethanol (E-PAF, E-PAH) or methanol 70% (v/v), and partition with solvents of increasing polarity [n-hexane (H-PAF, H-PAH), chloroform (C-PAF, C-PAH), ethyl acetate (Ea-PAF, Ea-PAH), and n-butanol (B-PAF, B-PAH)], yielding a total of 14 extracts/fractions. After considering the yield, water solubility, and the preliminary results of the larval migration test (LMT), the E-PAF, E-PAH, H-PAF, and H-PAH were selected for further experiments. E-PAH presented an efficiency concentration of 50% (EC50) of 36 mu g/mL on the LMT. E-PAH showed the greatest efficiency when its EC50 was compared to the other fractions (E-PAF = 147 mu g/mL; H-PAF = 801 mu g/mL; H-PAH = 77 mu g/mL). After that, the E-PAH was chemically characterized, considering its quantitative polyphenolic and flavonoid contents by colorimetric and chromatographic techniques. E-PAH presented 50, 38, and 24 mg/g of dry matter of total phenol, condensed tannins (CT), and flavonoid contents, respectively. Using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, E-PAH had shown to have epicatechin (4.7 mu g/mL), rutin (2.8 mu g/mL), and chlorogenic acid (1.4 mu g/mL) as its main constituents besides quercetin. These isolated compounds were evaluated using the LMT in order to relate the composition to the anthelmintic activity observed for E-PAH. Quercetin (EC50 = 7.8 mu g/mL) and epicatechin (EC50 = 10 mu g/mL) presented a higher efficiency than rutin (EC50 = 30 mu g/mL). Chlorogenic acid was also tested with the LMT but did not present a significant efficiency. According to the results, the phenolic composition of E-PAH and the EC50 values obtained for the isolated phenols, it can be suggested that, besides the CT content, the presence of epicatechin and rutin contributed to the larvicidal activity of E-PAH. In conclusion, avocado seeds may be used as a source of polyphenols with promising anthelmintic applications.

AB Filarial nematodes of the Eulimdana genus inhabit subcutaneous tissue of various avian species, mostly Charadriiforme birds. In domestic pigeons, E. clava is the only species recorded in the subcutaneous tissue in a number of isolated cases. In the present study, we discuss the morphology and histopathology of filarial nematodes recovered from subcutaneous tissue of domestic pigeons in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In total 110 pigeons were submitted to necropsy at the Department of Pathology of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in Sarajevo. At necropsy, in four pigeons (3.6%) numerous thread-like 0.9-2.1 cm long nematode parasites were observed in the subcutaneous tissue, peritracheal and periesophageal connective tissue. In one pigeon, the parasites were also found free in the body cavity around the heart and lungs. In addition, several 80-90 mu m long microfilariae were noted in the tissue cross-sections. No significant lesions were observed associated with adult parasites or microfilariae. Based on morphology, host species and localization detected parasites were identified as E. clava. Molecular analyses of the cox1 and 12S rRNA nucleotide sequences herein generated revealed the close genetic relationship to other filarioid nematodes. The importance of the nematodes in pigeons and the lack of sequences in genetic databases for comparison of avian filarial parasites are emphasized.

AB Aelurostrongylus abstrusus is a lungworm distributed worldwide that affects wild and domestic cats, causing bronchopneumonia of varying intensity. Snails serve as intermediate hosts. The aim of the present study was to assess the larval development of A. abstrusus in R. decollata snails and to investigate its potential as an intermediate host. For this purpose, first-stage larvae (L1) of A. abstrusus were obtained from the faeces of naturally infected cats. Doses of 500 L1/snail were given to 24 R. decollata snails, placed on the soil of the breeder chamber, and maintained under laboratory conditions. Three snails were killed at 8, 10, 12, 16, 22, 26, 45 and 55 days post-infection (dpi), and the muscular foot and visceral body were separately digested by an artificial digestion technique. The morphometric parameters of different larval stages were recorded. The mean number of larvae reaching the infective stage at the end of the study (L3) was 262 larvae/snail. The greatest development to L3 was recorded from days 16 to 55 pi, during which the isolation was maximum. A.

TI The effect on liveweight gain of using anthelmintics with incomplete

AB A replicated field trial was conducted to measure the effect on liveweight gain of failing to adequately control anthelmintic resistant populations of Cooperia oncophora and to determine whether populations, and hence production losses, increased with time. Eight mobs of 10 Friesian-Hereford calves were run on independent farmlets from January to December, over each of two years. All mobs were routinely treated with a pour-on formulation of eprinomectin every six weeks, which controlled parasites other than Cooperia. Four mobs also received six weekly treatments with an oral levamisole plus albendazole combination anthelmintic to control Cooperia. Liveweights, condition scores, faecal egg counts and larval numbers on pasture were measured throughout.
   In the first year animals treated with eprinomectin alone were 12.9 kg lighter in November than those treated with eprinomectin plus albendazole and levamisole, however, in the second year there was no difference between the treatment groups. The data, therefore, support the view that while C. oncophora is less pathogenic than other cattle parasite species it can still cause production losses when present in sufficient numbers.
   In the first year of the study, parasite load, as measured by faecal nematode egg count and larval numbers on herbage, tended to be higher and calf growth rates lower than in the second year. In both years, counts of infective larvae on herbage declined over winter spring to be at low levels before mid-summer. This suggests that the carry-over of infection from one crop of calves to the next was relatively small and hence that the level of challenge to the young calves at the start of each year was largely due to the effectiveness of the quarantine treatments administered when the animals arrived on the trial site. Low survival of larvae on pasture between grazing seasons, resulting in small larval populations on pasture when drenching programmes start each summer, might help to explain the widespread development of anthelmintic resistance in this parasite under New Zealand grazing systems.

AB The tapeworm Taenia solium is endemic in Zambia, however its socioeconomic cost is unknown. During a large-scale interventional study conducted in Zambia, baseline economic costs of human and porcine T. solium infections were measured.
   Questionnaire surveys were conducted within three neighbourhoods in Zambia's Eastern province in 2015 and 2016. A human health questionnaire, capturing costs of clinical symptoms commonly attributable to human cysticercosis and taeniasis, was conducted in randomly selected households (n = 267). All pig-keeping households were administered a pig socioeconomic questionnaire (n = 271) that captured pig demographic data, costs of pig-keeping, and economic losses from porcine cysticercosis.
   Of all respondents 62% had reportedly experienced at least one of the surveyed symptoms. Seizure-like episodes were reported by 12%, severe chronic headaches by 36%, and vision problems by 23% of respondents. These complaints resulted in 147 health care consultations and 17 hospitalizations in the five years preceding the study, and an estimated productivity loss of 608 working days per year.
   Of all pigs 69% were bought within villages. Nearly all adult pigs were sold to local traders, and tongue palpation for detection of cysticerci was commonly performed. Reportedly, 95% of pig owners could not sell tongue-positive pigs, while infected pigs fetched only 45% of the normal sale value.
   These preliminary costing data indicate that human and porcine T. solium infections substantially impact endemic areas of Eastern Zambia. A full socioeconomic burden assessment may enable improved T. solium management in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB Introduction: Theileria equi, an etiologic agent of equine piroplasmosis, is a tick-transmitted hemoprotozoan of the phylum Apicomplexa. Recent outbreaks of piroplasmosis in the United States have renewed interest in safe and effective treatment options. Although imidocarb dipropionate (IMD) is the drug of choice for clearance of T. equi, adverse reactions and recently documented resistance support the need for alternative therapeutic strategies. The recently described bumped kinase inhibitors (BKIs) are a new class of compounds that could potentially be used as safe and effective alternatives to IMD. In an initial effort to evaluate this potential, herein we determined the T. equi growth inhibitory activity of 11 BKIs relative to that of IMD and the previously tested BKI 1294. Because some BKIs have known human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) channel activity, we also assessed the hERG activity of each compound with the goal to identify those with the highest potency against T. equi coupled with the lowest potential for cardiotoxicity.
   Results: Six BKIs inhibited T. equi growth in vitro, including the previously evaluated BKI 1294 which was used as a positive control. All six compounds were significantly less potent (higher 50% effective concentration (EC50)) than IMD. Two of those compounds were more potent than BKI 1294 control but had similar hERG activity. Although the remaining three compounds had similar to lower potency than BKI 1294, hERG EC50 was higher for three of them (BKI 1735, BKI 1369 and BKI 1318).
   Conclusions: The SKI compounds evaluated in this study inhibited T. equi in vitro and had diverse hERG activity. Based on these considerations, three compounds would be suitable for further evaluation. While these results provide a foundation for future work, in vivo pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics, and safety studies are needed before BKI compounds can be recommended for clinical use in T. equi infected horses.

AB Progressing economic development in Southeast Asia has increased regional demand for goat meat, leading to expanding production by smallholders and recently, development of commercial farms. In Laos, an emerging export market for goats into Vietnam has led to increased goat numbers, with potential increases in risk of disease, particularly endoparasitism. A cross-sectional survey investigated the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in indigenous Kambing-Katjang goats on smallholder farms (n = 389) in 8 villages where no anthelmintic treatments were in use, providing comparisons with a case study of imported Boer crossbred goats (n = 45) on a commercial farm where intensive anthelmintic treatments were required to manage mortalities attributable to Haemonchosis. Clinical examinations, collection of faecal samples, and pathological examination on the commercial farm, accompanied collection of information on animal gender, age and body weight, with data analyses performed in Genstat. Faecal samples contained eggs of multiple endoparasitic species, with Strongyles spp. and coccidian oocysts of Eimeria spp. most prevalent. Significant associations between the presence of endoparasites and the farm type (smallholder versus commercial; p < 0.008 and 0.001) were observed, with the odds ratios of the commercial farm having Stronglyes spp. and Eirneria spp. of 1.3 (CI = 0.6-2.9) and 4.8 (CI = 2.5-9.1). Mortalities from endoparasitism were only recorded at the commercial farm, with the loss of 24 goats in the final 3 months of the dry season (Feb-April). This study identified a moderate prevalence of multiple endoparasitic species in smallholder goat farms that appeared well-tolerated, whereas in the developing commercial system, endoparasites posed significant risks to enterprise viability, even with use of anthelmintics. Further studies on endoparasite control are required if commercial tropical goat meat production is to prove sustainable and assist in addressing regional food security, plus provide a pathway to improve the livelihoods of Lao goat smallholders seeking to expand and intensify their enterprises.

AB The FAMACHA (c) system is used for targeted selective treatment (TST) of small ruminants for the control of haemonchosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of this system in growing lambs. Between 2015 and 2016, lambs aged 60-210 days on two sheep farms were evaluated at 15-day intervals using the FAMACHA (c) system (F1-F5), with analysis of hematocrit (Ht), counting of eggs per gram of feces, and larval culture. The sensitivity and specificity of the system were calculated according to two criteria: criterion 1, lambs classified as F4 or F5 were considered anemic (positive test) and those classified as F1, F2, or F3 were considered not anemic (negative test); and criterion 2, lambs classified as F3, F4, or F5 were considered anemic (positive test) and those classified as Fl and F2 were considered not anemic (negative test). Three gold standard Ht cutoff values were used to diagnose anemia, i.e., <= 22%, <= 18%, and <= 15%. In total, 1591 assessments were analyzed. The highest percentage of larvae in the fecal cultures was for Haemonchus spp., with an average of 78.5%. The sensitivity values found when F3 lambs were considered anemic were 13.9%, 30.8%, and 66.7%, respectively, for Ht cutoff values of <= 22%, <= 18%, and (c) 15%. When F3 lambs were excluded, the maximum sensitivity was 14.9% and the specificity was 100% for all degrees of anemia using criterion 1. The FAMACHA (c) system had low sensitivity in growing lambs and should not be used alone for control of haemonchosis in young animals.

AB Equine cyathostomin are pervasive gastrointestinal parasites with wide-spread resistance to the benzimidazole and tetrahydropyrimidine drug classes worldwide. Combination deworming has been proposed as a more sustainable parasite control strategy. Simulation studies have found combination deworming to be effective in controlling drug resistant ovine trichostrongylid parasites. One equine study demonstrated an additive effect of a combination of oxibendazole and pyrantel pamoate against cyathostomins. However, this is the only equine study evaluating combination therapy, and the effects of repeated combination treatments administered over time remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to observe the efficacy of repeated oxibendazole/pyrantel pamoate combination therapy administered over one year against a cyathostomin population with resistance to benzimidazole and pyrantel products. Fecal egg counts were determined for the entire herd (N = 21) at the day of anthelmintic treatment and at two-week intervals for eight weeks post treatment. Starting efficacies of oxibendazole (OBZ, 10 mg/kg) and pyrantel pamoate (PYR, 6.6 mg base/kg) were 66.7% and 63.3%, respectively. Hereafter, the herd was treated four times with an oxibendazole/pyrantel pamoate combination, eight weeks apart, followed by repeating the single active treatments before concluding the study. While the first combination treatment exhibited an additive effect of the two active ingredients, this efficacy was not sustained over the course of the study. Mean fecal egg count reduction (FECR) was significantly greater for the first combination treatment (76.6%) than the second (42.6%, p = 0.0454), third (41.6%, p = 0.0318), and fourth (40.7%, p = 0.0372) combination treatments. The final single active mean FECRs were 42.3% for oxibendazole, and 42.7% for pyrantel pamoate. These efficacies were not significantly different from the initial single active efficacies (OBZ, p = 0.4421; PYR, p = 0.8361). These results suggest that combination therapy against double resistant equine cyathostomin populations is not sustainable, when using actives with markedly decreased starting efficacies.

AB Leishmania infantum is a vector-borne zoonotic disease transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies and dogs are considered the main reservoir of the parasite. Feline leishmaniosis (FeL) caused by L. infannun is an emergent feline disease more and more frequently reported in endemic areas. This review summarizes current knowledge focusing similarities and differences with canine leishmaniosis (CanL). Cats are infected by the same Leishmania species than dogs but prevalence of the infection is lower and cases of disease are less frequently reported. Scarce information is available on adaptive immune response of cats naturally exposed to L. infantum infection and mechanisms responsible for susceptibility or resistance of feline hosts. However, about half of clinical cases of FeL are reported in cats with possible impaired immunocompetence. Coinfections or comorbidities are frequently detected in sick cats and they can contribute to a misrepresentation of clinical FeL albeit lesions associated with the presence of the parasite have been detected in skin, lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, liver, oral mucosa, stomach, large bowel, kidney, nasal exudate, lung, eye. As for dogs, skin or mucocutaneous lesions are the most common reason for veterinary consultation and finding on physical examination in cats with leishmaniosis.
   Molecular investigations of Leishmania DNA and anti-Leishmania antibody detection are largely used with the same methodologies for both CanL and FeL, however few information is available about their diagnostic performance in feline hosts. Treatment of cats with clinical FeL is still empirically based and off label by using the most common drugs prescribed to dogs. Life expectancy of cats with clinical FeL is usually good unless concurrent conditions or complications occur and prognosis does not seem significantly influenced by therapy or retroviral coinfection.
   According to current knowledge, cats can play a role as additional reservoir host of L. infantum and, in a "One Health" perspective, preventative measures should be taken.
   In conclusion, albeit feline infection and the associated cat disease caused by L. infantum is increasingly reported in endemic areas and have many similarities with CanL, consolidated evidence-based knowledge is not available and we cannot exclude that important differences between dogs and cats exist about transmission, immunopathogenesis and best practice for management and prevention.

AB Excitation-power dependency of upconversion (UC) photons have been quantified in Tm3+/Yb3+ doped fluorotellurite (BALMT) glasses under the excitation of 975 nm laser. The net powers of three-photon-excited blue and red and two-photon-excited NIR emissions are determined to be 242, 101 and 7994 mu W in 0.5 wt% Tm2O3 and 2 wt% Yb2O3 co-doping case under the excitation power of 870 mW, respectively, and the net emission photon numbers are identified to be 58.2 x 10(13), 33.0 x 10(13) and 3253.2 x 10(13)cps. The quantum yields (QYs) for multi-photon-excited UC emissions of Tm3+ are identified as a positive dependency with pumping powers, and the relativity for three-photon fluorescence is extremely severe. When the excitation power density is set to 110.8 W/mm(2), the QY values for 476 nm blue and 650 nm red UC emissions are up to 1.49 x 10(-4) and 0.84 x 10(-4), and furthermore, the value for 809 nm NIR UC emission is as high as 83.22 x 10(-4). The 809 nm luminescence is one of the good matching wavelengths for iris recognition in NIR ranges, the intensive NIR luminescence and the efficient blue fluorescence are promising in scanning and positioning for iris scanning. The macroscopic quantization for UC photon generation from Tm3+ in low-phonon fluorotellurite glasses provides a reliable reference for developing compact high-power-density light sources in iris recognition.

AB The thermal conductivity of silicate melts was evaluated using a thermal resistor network model, which consisted of a diamond lattice. Based on the assumption that the mean free path of phonons is shorter than the interatomic distance, the thermal conductivity of the silicate melts was calculated through a Monte-Carlo simulation based on the non-bridging oxygens to tetrahedral cations (NBO/T) ratio and the ratio of the conductance, of silicon with NBOs (CSi-NBO) to that of silicon with bonding oxygens (CSi-BO). For NBO/T < 1, the simulated thermal conductivity of the silicate melts was in good agreement with that reported in the literature. Thus, the proposed method and the three-dimensional thermal resistor network model used are suitable for estimating the thermal conductivity of silicate melts.

AB The synergy between glass melting and glass flow character was investigated by mathematical modelling of a Joule heated glass melting channel with a central longitudinal row of vertical heating electrodes. The glass melt containing sand particles and bubbles entered the channel where different types of the melt flow were set up. The sand particle dissolution and the bubble removal were monitored up to the achievement of phenomena completion. The increasing fraction of energy supplied to the input region of the channel proved to be crucial for setting up the beneficial character of the melt flow and consequent increase of the melting performance. When the temperature of the inputting melt decreased, the melting performance also decreased. The relations of the "energetic model" were derived and applied to predict the beneficial type and conditions of the melt flow. The best results have been obtained for the flow character near the uniform flow. The beneficial state was achieved when each region of the channel was supplied by the energy needed there for glass heating and heat losses. The impact of the temperature of the inputting melt on the detailed character of the melt flow was discussed with the help of the energetic model.

Uniaxial tensile test and environmental stability of such hybrid fibers are examined. Homogeneous distribution of Rhodamine 6G in silica fibers is confirmed by fluorescence image. Only J-type dimers are confirmed in our electrospun Rh6G/SiO2 hybrid fibers, and the increase of the Rh6G concentration gives rise to a progressive red shift and a broadening in the maximum emission spectra. The emission intensity of electrospun hybrid fibers can be sensitive to the temperature and the relative maximum emission intensity may decrease gradually in the whole measured temperature range.

AB Yb3+ doped silica sol-gel glass powders were prepared with different concentrations of SiO2, Al2O3 and P2O5 in order to understand the impact of the glass composition on the Yb3+ emission properties. In this paper, we clearly show that not only the Al/P ratio but also the SiO2 content have an impact on the Yb3+ spectroscopic properties. Our results provide new insight on the real impact of the composition on the spectroscopic properties of Yb3+ doped sol-gels: we demonstrate that an increase in the Al2O3 content at the expense of P2O5 leads to an increase in the intensity of the emission at 1000 nm of the Yb3+ ions whereas an increase in the SiO2 content decreases it. We clearly showed that the inexpensive sol-gel approach can be easily used when investigating new Yb3+ doped silica glasses.

AB A series of transition metal oxide-doped glass nanocomposites of the common nomenclature xV(2)O(5)-(1-x) (0.05MoO(3)-0.95ZnO) for x = 0 to 0.9 have been synthesized through the melt quenching process and characterized by X-ray diffraction, Transmission electron microscopy and optical absorption spectroscopic studies. Positron annihilation lifetime and coincidence Doppler broadening measurements are also performed to identify the vacancy type defects present in the samples of the differing V2O5 concentration. The X-ray diffraction patterns showed clear diffraction peaks indicating the presence of nanocrystallites in samples of x = 0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 whereas significantly broadened patterns were additionally observed in the case of samples of x = 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 reflecting a dominant amorphous nature. Transmission electron microscopy images indicated the formation of nanocrystallites of varying sizes and morphologies and the high resolution transmission electron microscopy patterns showed well defined fringes, some of them showing discontinuities in samples of larger x. Further, selected area electron diffraction patterns displayed diffuse rings superposed with bright spots, indicating the formation of nanocrystallites dispersed in an amorphous matrix. The optical band gap energy estimated from the UV-Vis absorption measurements decreased with increasing content of V2O5. Positron lifetime measurements indicated the trapping of positrons in the interfacial gaps around the nanocrystallites for lower values of x (i.e., 0 to 0.3) and then in the porous defects within the amorphous matrix of the samples of higher values of x (= 0.5 to 0.9). The coincidence Doppler broadening spectroscopic measurements further confirmed the presence of vacancy type defects arising from cation non-stoichiometry and the amorphous character of the largely doped nanocomposites. The studies demonstrated defect characterization as an alternative approach in the investigation of metal oxide nanocomposite formation and evolution during compositional variations and thermal treatments.

AB Bacterial attachment and biofilm formation on implant surface has been a major concern in hospital and industrial environment. Prevention of bacterial infections of implant surface through surface treatment could be a potential solution and hence this has become a key area of research. In the present study, the antibacterial and biocompatible properties of femtosecond laser surface treated 45S5 bioactive glass (BG) have been investigated. Adhesion and sustainability of both gram positive S. aureus and gram negative P. aeruginosa and E. coil nosocomial bacteria on untreated and laser treated BG samples has been explored. An imprint method has been used to visualize the growth of bacteria on the sample surface. We observed complete bacterial rejection potentially reducing risk of biofilm formation on laser treated surface. This was correlated with surface roughness, wettability and change in surface chemical composition of the samples before and after laser treatment. Biocompatibility of the laser treated BG was demonstrated by studying the anchoring and growth of human cervix cell line INT407. Our results demonstrate that, laser surface modification of BG enables enhanced bacterial rejection without affecting its biocompatibility towards growth of human cells on it. These results open a significantly potential approach towards use of laser in successfully imparting desirable characteristics to BG based bio-implants and devices.

AB Phosphate glasses with various Er2O3 content have been prepared by the melt-quenching method. Differential thermal analysis was also carried out to obtain the glass transition and the crystallization temperatures, related to the thermal stability of the sample. Optical parameters such as refractive index n, complex dielectric constant (epsilon* = epsilon(1) + i epsilon(2)), and complex optical conductivity (sigma* = sigma(1) + i sigma(2)) of these glasses were determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry in the spectral range 1.5-4.5 eV at incident angle 78 degrees. The glass samples present a low refractive index (n(lambda) does not exceed 1.46) compared to other glasses. The real epsilon(1) and imaginary parts epsilon(2) of the dielectric constant epsilon, show that in 3.7-4.4 eV energy range, there is no dispersion and the absorption is minimal therefore, in this small domain our samples are good candidates to be exploited in the propagation of the electromagnetic waves.

AB Sm3+ doped ZnO-Al2O3-BaO-B2O3 glasses have been prepared and characterized. These glasses have been developed by melt and quenching technique. The characterization includes the physical, optical, luminescence, and radiative properties. The lasing potential of glass samples such as oscillator strengths, JO parameter, stimulated emission cross-sections, radiative transition probability, and branching ratios have been calculated by using Judd-Ofelt theory. The results show that the maximum intensity of emission spectra of the prepared glass sample is at the wavelength of 598 nm due to the (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(7/2) transition, excited by lambda(ex) = 403 nm. From CIE 1931 chromaticity, the title glasses were found to be a potential material for laser application in the orange region.

AB Optical properties of Ge20S80-xGax thin films, using well established Swanepoel's method, have been reported. Thin films of Ge20S80-xGax glassy alloy were deposited on glass substrates by thermal evaporation technique under high vacuum conditions (similar to 10(-5) Torr). FE-SEM images show that the films are amorphous and surface smoothness improves with an increase in Ga concentration. Presence of excess number of lone pair's electrons (L) and increase in average coordination number < Z >, show that the material under study is a good glass former. Refractive index (n(1)) is found to increase whereas the extinction coefficient (K) decreases with an increase in Ga content. Increase in refractive index is a consequence of increased polarization and density of the glassy alloy. Addition of Ga augments the non-linear response of Ge-S binary alloy. Obtained values of non-linear refractive index (n(nl)) are higher than the values reported in the literature for other chalcogenide glasses. Optical band gap decreases with an increase in Ga concentration. Decrease in cohesive energy and formation of enough localized states in the band gap is liable for the decrease in optical band gap. Correlation between the refractive index dispersion and the microstructure of films has been elucidated by the single effective oscillator model. Obtained optical properties are consistent with predicted physical properties of Ge20S80-xGax glassy alloy.

AB We report an experimental investigation focused on the green emission detected in gamma-ray irradiated Bismuth doped photonic crystal fibers. Our photoluminescence spectra, recorded at room temperature, provide evidence for the presence of two emission bands both located at similar to 530 nm (2.34 eV). One emission is detected only in the Bi-doped core while the other, is detected in the cladding. These two emissions feature different excitation spectra and a fast and a slow decay lifetime. The origin of the fast emission decay, about ten nanoseconds, is tentatively attributed to a silica intrinsic defect, whereas the slow component, having lifetime of about 2 mu s and featuring anti-stokes emission, is certainly caused by Bi related defects.

AB Eu3+-doped ternary SiO2-TiO2-ZrO2 glasses were prepared through a non-hydrolytic sol-gel process. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was employed to identify the vibrational modes present in the ternary glass. The phonon energies were calculated using excitation spectrum and complemented well with the vibrational modes in the Raman spectrum. Photoluminescence spectrum was used to assess the luminescent augmentation. The uniform distribution of dopant ions in the as prepared ternary glass aided in achieving a comparatively unmatched doping concentration of Eu3+ ion (17.5 wt%) without luminescence quenching and it can be attributed to reduced cluster formation. High concentration of rare earth ion incorporation leads to intense and tunable emission with higher brightness. Excellent color purity of the emission by means of CIE color gamut for the red color was observed, which is close to the National Television Standard Committee (NTSC) value. Theoretical investigations of the photophysical parameters and radiative decay time were carried out with Judd-Ofelt analysis. The double exponentially fitted decay curve gave a satisfactory experimental lifetime. These results indicate that tailor made europium doped ternary SiO2-TiO2-ZrO2 glasses have potential applications in the areas of photonic devices as well as biological sensors because of its intense tunable and efficient emission, high purity, and low toxicity.

AB The serrated flow dynamics and shear band motions can be controlled by changing aspect ratio (AR) and deformation degree. With decreasing ARs, the serration pattern transforms from a sharp-peak type with uniform size into a complex type with various sizes, the ratio of stress drop time t(D) to rising time t(R) for serrated flow increases, the time intervals t(n) between adjacent serrations decreases. The serrated flow exhibits a crossover from Gaussian-type distribution to power-law-type distribution with decreasing ARs. This crossover is mainly governed by a transition from single-shear-band dominated deformation to cooperative motions of multiple shear bands dominated deformation. Additionally, such crossover can also be governed by deformation degree.

AB Under its crystalline form, the ZnGeN2 alloy is promising for optoelectronic devices such as LEDs because of its large, direct and adjustable band gap. Nevertheless, data are scarce, more especially for the amorphous form. We report here on the study of zinc germanium nitride amorphous thin films obtained by reactive co-sputtering. The samples are elaborated by PVD and analyzed by physical and chemical methods to determine their composition, structure and optical properties. We observe a clear evolution of these properties with composition. The shape of the complex refractive index reveals changes in the electronic structure. Furthermore, the optical gap and Urbach energy decrease with increasing zinc content.

AB The thermal stability in air and nitrogen of an oxynitride NaPON glass with high nitrogen content (N/P = 0.5) has been investigated with regards to its structural evolution with temperature. The glass transition temperature (T-g) of the powdered glass is found to decrease upon oxidation, especially when the treatment temperature (T-a) is larger than the T-g of the original oxynitride glass. Upon isothermal oxidation, crystalline metaphosphate forms at the interface of the oxide layer as the dominant phase in both the powder and bulk samples, as detected by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. A new deconvolution scheme of Raman spectra is proposed, involving a structural model proposed to account for the in situ high temperature changes of the local structural groups. A distinction is made between different oxynitride Q(n)(P,N) tetrahedral sites, and two separate bands related to tricoordinated nitrogen speciation (N-t) are distinguished in the oxidized NaPON glass. N-t groups are connected to either one oxygen or one nitrogen, resulting in two separate Raman bands. The position and area of these N-t-related peaks exhibit an opposite trend with temperature in air and N-2. Furthermore, the Raman results imply a thermally driven depolymerization of the oxynitride sub-structure, which could involve a nano-scale phase separation of the nitrogen-involved structure network. In terms of technological applications, this work suggests that the oxynitride glasses should be used in the temperature range up to the glass transition temperature, above which the structural stability is lost.

AB The influence of BaF2 on the physical and spectroscopic properties of Cr3+/Ho3+ co-doped germanate glass is investigated systematically by differential scanning calorimeter, excitation and emission spectra, as well as dynamic decay lifetime. The intense and broad absorption band of Cr3+ provides a selective pump scheme for obtaining an efficient 2.0 mu m emission of Ho3+, the OH- absorption coefficient, on the other hand, is decreased as low as 1.08 cm(-1), which both highly conducive to obtain an intense 2.0 mu m emission of Ho3+. In addition, the crystal-field parameter D-q/B of Cr3+-doped glasses is also calculated to study the influence of BaF2 on the local environment of activators and sensitizers. Further theoretic calculation shows that the largest absorption and emission cross-sections of Ho3+ near 2.0 mu m are as high as 4.6 and 5.2 (x 10(-21) cm(2)) in the 10 mol% BaF2 modified Cr3+/Ho3+ co-doped glass and the maximum energy transfer efficiency from Cr3+ to Ho3+ is about 42.5%. All results suggest that this BaF2 modified Cr3+/Ho3+ co-doped glass is very suitable for a high-efficient 2.0 mu m fiber lasers with flexible pump sources.

AB The amorphous thin film metallic glasses (TFMGs) have been studied widely due to their unique properties and ease of fabrication as compared with the bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). Among the many TFMG systems, the W-based TFMG remains unstudied. In this work, a series of ternary W-Zr-Si TFMGs containing various W content ranging from 49.3 to 66.5 at.% were fabricated using a magnetron co-sputtering system. Increasing the W content of W-Zr-Si TFMG rendered an increase of Young's modulus up to 182 +/- 4 GPa with the highest W content of 66.5 at.%. The film hardness was 13 GPa, independent of the W concentration in the as-deposited W-Zr-Si TFMGs. The influence of post-annealing on the microstructure and mechanical properties of TFMGs was studied by a vacuum thermal treatment ranging from 450 to 750 degrees C under various holding times. The surface roughness increased with increasing annealing temperature, with the sample annealed at the supercooled liquid region exhibited the lowest surface roughness of 1.14 nm. The hardness of TFMGs increased with increasing annealing temperature and longer holding time due to annealing-induced crystallization with a highest hardness of 16.8 +/- 0.5 GPa. However, the indentation toughness decreased upon annealing and the lowest value was achieved for the hardest film due to the increasing amount of short range ordered (SRO) clusters.

AB Effects of SnO addition on the optical properties of Pb-1 - xSnxSe quantum dots (QDs) were investigated as a function of GeO2 content [GeO2] in germanosilicate glasses. Addition of SnO resulted in a red-shift of the absorption bands from QDs at [GeO2] < 20 mol%, but in a blue-shift at [GeO2] >= 20 mol%. Addition of GeO2 to the glass caused a large decrease in its viscosity, so it increased diffusion coefficient (D); as a result the amount of Sn in Pb-1 - xSnxSe QDs increased. D of Sn2+ was similar to 560 times higher in the glasses with [GeO2] = 40 mol% than in the glass with no GeO2. The differences in Sn content in QDs affected their bandgap.

AB Aerogel was a potential substitute for the traditional thermal insulation materials. But aerogets fragility and high prices have negative effects on the mechanical property and cost of aerogel-based building thermal insulation materials. To solve this problem, a novel thermal insulation composite aerogel/expanded perlite (AEP) was prepared by filling the aerogel into porous structure of expanded perlite (EP). The aerogel in the pores of AEP would be protected by solid skeleton of AEP, and also reduce the thermal conductivity of AEP. The AEP was characterized by X-Ray diffraction, Fourier transformation infrared, digital microscope, scanning electron microscope, N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and transient hot-wire method. The results reveal that aerogel could be effectively distributed in porous structure of EP and has a positive effect on the pore structure and thermal insulation performance of EP. AEP has typical mesoporous structure and shows chemical stability and hydrophobicity. The mesoporous volumes and BET specific surface areas of AEP were about 100-280 times and 50-150 times as large as those of EP, respectively. And thermal conductivities of AEP were decreased by 14.7-31.8% than EP. All results suggested that AEP can be considered as potential building thermal insulation materials due to good thermal insulation performance and lower cost.

The samples were prepared on substrates of silicon and silica with different oxygen flow rates ranged from 0 sccm to 40 sccm with a step of 10 sccm. Refractive index of the samples were obtained by spectra inversion technique. It's suggested that the value of refractive index presents first decrease and then increase as the oxygen flow rate larger, and the turning point is about 30 sccm both at 0.633 mu m and 10.6 mu m. And the SiO2 thin films were confirmed all amorphous structure by the XRD measurement. The proportion of hydroxyl in SiO2 thin film were determined by XPS, which is beneficial to analyze the film defects. Also the Si-O-Si angle and vibration frequency in TO mode and LO mode were researched by FTIR spectra.

AB Phosphates play a role in different foaming processes. In slag foaming, the phosphate can lower the surface tension and increase the foam life time. In the sintering-foaming process, sodium phosphates are added as "foam stabilizers". Though, phosphates show documented effect in slag foaming, the effect of phosphate in the sintering-foaming process still needs to be clarified. In this work, we investigate the influence of alkali phosphates (Li3PO4, Na3PO4, and K3PO4) on the glass foaming process, foam density, and glass transition temperature (T-g) of waste silicate glasses. The results show that the Tg of foam glasses decreases with increasing the alkali phosphate content, and with decreasing the alkali ion radius. The results, therefore, indicate that alkali phosphates can be used to decrease the heat-treatment temperature, however, only K3PO4 and Na3PO4 prove to be promising candidates to obtain low density foam glasses.

AB New glass nanocomposites (GNCs) of the nominal compositions [(100-x) TeO2-xSrTiO(3)] with x = 5, 10 and 15 (in mol%) were prepared. The glassy phase in the GNCs samples was established by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Differential thermal analysis (DTA) studies. The SrTiO3 nanoparticles/clusters embedded in tellurite glass matrix for GNCs were identified by transmission electron microscopic (TEM) and confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) study. The optical transmission (at x = 5) and the electron spin resonance (ESR) studies for the GNCs samples indicated that the presence of Ti3+ ions in tetragonal distorted octahedral sites. The variation of the thermal, density (rho) and the molar volume (V-m) of the GNCs samples with increasing SrTiO3 were discussed in terms of the structural modifications that take place in the glass matrix. The dielectric properties and ac conductivity of the GNCs samples cannot be explained on the basis of the proportion of Ti3+ ions only.

AB Structure and dielectric properties of different compositions of Ag2O-SeO2-TeO2 mixed former glasses have been reported in this paper. Amorphous nature of the compositions has been confirmed from X-ray diffraction patterns. Thermal stability of these glasses has been investigated using differential scanning calorimetry and a connection between glass transition temperature and cross-linking density has been established. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been used to investigate the effect of SeO2 on the glass network structure, and the existence of different structural units, such as TeO4, TeO3 and SeO32- has been ascertained. The composition dependence of the relative proportion of these structural units has been studied. Dielectric spectra have been analyzed using Cole-Cole model. The relaxation time obtained from the analysis exhibits Arrhenius behavior. The activation energy for the relaxation time shows mixed glass former effect. Further, dielectric properties of these glasses have been correlated with the polarizability along with the optical basicity of these glasses.

AB Transparent thermoluminescent alumino-phosphate-sodium glass system of 15Al(2)O(3)-35P(2)O(5)-25CaO-25Na(2)CO(3) (all in mol%) doped with different concentrations of SiO2 were prepared by conventional melt quenching technique. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies checked the amorphous nature of the prepared glass. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) of the glass system was investigated to find the effect of SiO2-dopant concentrations on the absorption spectra in comparison with that of bulk sample (without dopants). Direct and indirect energy band gaps (E-opt) were determined and found to be in the range of 2.47-3.65 eV for m = 1/2 and 2.24-3.3 eV for m = 2. Refractive index (n) for each E-opt value vary from 2.42 to 2.55 and from 2.32 to 2.63 for the direct and indirect transition, respectively. Urbach energy values of the newly prepared glasses are found to be from 0.57 to 0.98 eV. In addition, effect of UV exposure on thermoluminescence (TL) sensitivity was also examined for APCNSi(5) (contains 500 ppm SiO2 concentration) and a linear response to dose was obtained, indicating that this type of glass is promising as a TL dosimeter within the UV range.

AB Previous studies show that there are some similarities between glass transition and melt process for metals. We assume that the glass transition occurs when the amplitude of atomic vibrational motions exceeds a critical fraction of the atomic spacing, and find that the glass transition temperature of metallic glass is proportional to the product of its Young's modulus and molar volume. The finding indicates that the glass transition is associated with the vibrational motions of atoms, and a Lindemann-type criterion holds for the glass transition temperature of metallic glasses.

AB Biochar, as an important renewable and carbon-natural energy, shows plentiful prospects to be used in the ironmaking industry. In this study, the effect of iron ore content and temperature on the reduction of iron ore-biochar pellets in nitrogen atmosphere were investigated. Results indicated that with the decrease of carbon to iron ratio, the iron ore indirect reduction was promoted more than char conversion which resulted in an decrease value of CO:CO2. Pellets reduction at 900 degrees C found that 60% iron ore in pellet exhibited considerable carbon conversion and the highest iron ore reduction amount. With the increase of reaction temperature, the char gasification reaction was promoted prior to the iron ore reduction, resulting in an increase of CO:CO2 ratio. The wustite and metallic Fe gradually increased, while hematite and magnetite gradually decreased, with the increase of temperature. Kinetics study found that carbon conversion was controlled by one-dimensional diffusion, while the iron phase reduction reaction was controlled by three-dimensional diffusion, and the increasing activation energy as the reaction proceeded restricted the iron reduction process. The intrinsic reaction behavior, thermal kinetics, and technical analysis may guide the application of bioenergy in the ironmaking industry.

AB An experimental study was conducted on a solar hybrid system to transform the waste heat of photovoltaic module (PV module) into a useful heat which could be used in a solar desalination (SD) system in order to produce freshwater (scenario 1). Then, different parameters such as the amount of the produced freshwater by condensed vapor on the glass cover and basin side walls were taken into consideration after the fabrication of the SD system. Furthermore, the effect of water depth in the tray and the effect of the presence of a fan inside the basin (scenario 3) on water yield (kg/m(2) hr) were evaluated. In addition, the effects of using a mirror to lead the reflected light on the PV module and its power output as well as different parameters of PV module were measured (scenario 4). The daily overall system efficiency (Thermal + Electrical) of the active (scenarios 1, 3 and 4) and passive (scenario 2) configurations were calculated. Furthermore, the mirror installation caused an increase in freshwater production and electric power. Finally, economic analysis was performed on the proposed system by which the production cost for a liter of freshwater was calculated.

AB In this study, first a new method has been presented for equalization of ambient conditions in different experiments on cooling towers. Next, using this method, the effect of four nanofluids including Zinc Oxide/Water, Silica/Water, Alumina/Water, and Graphene/Water has been investigated experimentally on the thermal performance of a wet cooling tower with a cross flow. The nanofluids have been studied at concentrations of 0.02, 0.05, and 0.08 wt% and the parameters of cooling range, effectiveness of the cooling tower, evaporation rate, the cooling tower characteristic, and volumetric heat transfer coefficient have been calculated and compared with each other. The different behavior of these nanofluids on the thermal performance of the cooling tower has also been indicated. For example, with the use of Graphene/Water at 0.02 wt%, the effectiveness and cooling tower characteristic have increased by 8.3% and 36%, respectively in comparison with pure water. On the other hand, with the use of Alumina/Water nanofluid across all the concentrations, the thermal performance of the cooling tower has weakened in comparison with pure water, and for example at 0.08 wt% of this nanofluid, the cooling tower characteristic has diminished by 14.7% in relation with pure water. Furthermore, by comparing the investigated nanofluids, it was found that Graphene/Water has resulted the best thermal performance in the cooling tower across all the concentrations, when compared with other investigated nanofluids. Moreover, the best thermal performance of the cooling tower by Graphene/Water has been obtained at 0.02 wt%, at which the volumetric heat transfer coefficient has increased by 36.2%, in comparison with pure water.

AB The drag-based Savonius hydrokinetic turbine (SHT) has an enormous potential for small-scale power generation from free-flowing water and it can be deployed especially at sites remote from existing electricity grids. These turbines can be installed in waves, tides, ocean currents, natural flow of water in rivers, manmade channels and irrigation canals to produce power. The performance of a SHT are highly influenced by its design parameters such as blade profile, number of blades, overlap ratio and aspect ratio. Although, over a period of nine dacade since its invention, serveral studies have been carried out, however, no particular concencus on the optimum design of SHT is arrived. In view of this, in the present investigation, as attempt has been made to parametrically evaluate the performance of the SET through experimental and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. The SET under investigation has been developed in-house. Initially, a comparison of performance between two-and three-bladed SHT with conventional semicircular blades has been carried out experimentally where their maximum power coefficients are found to be 0.28 and 0.17, respectively at their corresponding tip-speed ratios of 0.84 and 0.67. Further experiments with a two-bladed SHT turbine with elliptical blades have shown its inferior performance as compared to the two-bladed semicircular SHT. The reason behind the enhanced performance of the two-bladed semicircular SHT is then analyzed through two-dimensional CFD simulations. Finally, the experiments are conducted at various immersion levels, where the performances of the SHTs are found to degrade with a decrease in immersion. However, the two-bladed semicircular SHT maintains to have a better performance than the others.

AB Adiabatic compressed air energy storage presents a valuable and environmentally friendly option for massive energy storage. Currently, efficiencies are approximately 70%, in part due to the issue of exergy losses during the air throttling. To enhance the performance of the system, a novel adiabatic compressed air energy storage is proposed using a new throttling strategy with an additional ejector. The compressed air in the storage vessels has been divided into three parts with different pressures. The part of compressed air with highest pressure is regarded as primary fluid of ejector to compress the part of air with lowest pressure in the other storage vessel to an intermediate pressure. Hence the inlet pressure of high pressure turbine enhanced, results in the system efficiency improves. The thermodynamic analysis including energy analysis, exergy analysis and the parametric analysis are evaluated by using steady-state mathematical model and thermodynamic laws. The calculations show that the round trip efficiency improves nearly 2% and the profit increases by more than 21% compared to the conventional adiabatic compressed air energy storage system. Meanwhile, a parametric analysis is also carried out to evaluate the effects of several key parameters on the system performance of the proposed adiabatic compressed air energy storage system.

AB The Stirling engine has drawn much attention as it can utilize sustainable energy such as solar, waste heat, and biomass. Although the Stirling cycle has the same theoretical efficiency as the Carnot cycle, the thermal efficiency of an actual Stirling engine is lower than that of the ideal Carnot cycle owing to their reversibility. Previous finite-time thermodynamic models of Stirling engines are mainly focused on the temperature difference between the working substance and heat reservoirs. However, there is also a temperature difference between the working substance and the regenerator, which has merely been reported in previous literatures. In this study, we analyzed the regenerative processes of the Stirling engine using finite-time thermodynamics. Using an even distribution temperature assumption, the regenerative effectiveness and its limitations were obtained. For an uneven distribution temperature assumption, the regenerator was modeled by dividing it into n sub-regenerators. Two cases, for either constant or varying temperatures of the sub-regenerators, are discussed in detail, and the same regenerative effectiveness was obtained for the limit n -> infinity Furthermore, the thermal efficiency and output power were obtained, and the effects of the parameters on the performance of the Stirling engine were investigated.

ID DESIGN; FRAMEWORK
AB In the present study a comprehensive thermodynamic model and degradation based optimization framework for energy management of anode supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks are carried out. The optimization framework determines optimum operating conditions to maximize system productivity (energy generation over system lifetime) considering degradation mechanisms. The main degradation mechanisms in anode supported SOFCs are nickel coarsening and oxidation. In this study, the optimum operating conditions regarding these degradation mechanisms to achieve maximum productivity at different target lifetimes are derived. The results show that target lifetime has a significant impact on system productivity and optimum operating temperature and current density. Furthermore, SOFC optimum operating conditions as a function of target lifetime are derived. To show the effectiveness of the developed framework, model outputs are compared with two other operating strategies; a base case strategy that optimizes system operating conditions without considering degradation mechanisms and a strategy based on Department of Energy's (DOE) 2016 fuel cell report. Results illustrated that degradation based optimization is more beneficial for improving the entire performance in long-term operation:For instance, system productivity is 7.4% higher in comparison with DOE strategy during 40,000 h operating lifetime. It is expected that the proposed methodology will lead to more rapid commercialization of SOFC technology.

AB In this study, spherical mixed oxides of Al2O3 and TiO2 supported molybdenum (Mo) catalysts, Mo/Al2O3-TiO2, were successfully prepared using a novel approach combining sol-gel and spray pyrolysis (SP) methods. First, both boehmite sol and titania sol were prepared by a sol-gel process, and then molybdate salt was dispersed in the sol mixture with the assistance of citric acid, followed by spray pyrolysis of the mixed precursor solution. Structural analyses of prepared catalysts showed that the dispersion of active sites was affected by the TiO2 concentration in the Al2O3-TiO2 mixed oxide support. The catalytic activities of reduced catalysts were investigated for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of palmitic acid, which is the main component of microalgae-derived biocrude. The results show that the Mo/Al2O3-TiO2 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic performance for the HDO of palmitic acid.

AB An innovative design for Solar Preheating Hybrid Gas Turbine (SPHGT) is originally introduced in this article. In the proposed concept, solar energy collected by a HTF solar field is used for preheating the compressed air. A thermodynamic and heat transfer models for each component have been developed and validated by comparing their predictions with experiments and pertinent laboratories codes. Two configurations have been considered for comparison to the reference cycle, i.e., one with solar-salt (SS-SP-GT) and another with Therminol VP-1 (VP1-SP-GT). We have carried out an analysis based on six performance indicators. The analysis has revealed that SPHGT is mainly affected by the compression ratio and the field operation temperatures. More in-depth, the compression ratio has stronger effect on the performance than solar field. At lower compression ratio (sigma c = 7), solar-to-electric efficiency of 17% has been obtained for VP1-SP-BC compared with 15% for SS-SP-BC. However, at higher compression ratio (sigma c = 23), the value of 22% is reachable by the latter configuration while the former (VP1-SP-BC) is becoming unfeasible due to the technical limits.

AB Gallium is known to have favorable thermo-physical features and may be used advantageously as a phase change material in heat sinks for thermal management systems (TMS). Yet, it suffers from a major inherent drawback namely its limited specific heat that can offset its other favorable features. The aim of this work is to propose a new simple approach to circumvent such drawbacks and to enhance the applicability of solid gallium as phase change material for TMS by integrating within it discretely distributed cavities filled with chunks of un-en-capsulated PCM material. Two PCM cavities arrangements were considered; structured well-defined cylindrical cavities, and randomly distributed randomly shaped cavities. Implementing PCM as proposed hereby aims at capturing some of the heat dumped from a hot source into the gallium and thereby serving two purposes: (1) reduce the gallium's temperature and (2) reduce melting rate of gallium during phase change upon receiving heat from the source. The hot to-be-cooled source is resembled here by batches of hot water (40 and 60 ml) brought into direct contact with the solid gallium/PCM sink matrix. Two percentages of PCM loading in gallium were considered; 5% and 10% volume fraction. Results have shown that using PCM as proposed is effective in maintaining low gallium sink temperature upon receiving heat from the source. The structured configuration leads only to slight superiority of sink performance. Increasing volumetric PCM loading in gallium up to about 10% clearly improves gallium's performance as heat sink and results in faster cooling rates as compared to the reference baseline case with only gallium without PCM. For 60 ml of hot water, the temperature drop from similar to 70 degrees C to similar to 40 was done in similar to 100 s which results in 140 s time saving as compared to the reference case.

The PVTE mode was tested generally with 22 thermoelectric modules, 11 of which were arranged in series and 11 in parallel. The results showed the coefficient of performance (COP) and consumption power of compressor in one-evaporator compression cooling system and hybrid dual-evaporator compression cooling system with PVTE collector were 3.69, 3.754 and 1.353 kW, 1.332 kW, respectively, indicating the positive effect of PVTE evaporator on the coefficient of performance and consumption power of compressor. Moreover, the findings indicated that for PVTE air and evaporator, the maximal electrical efficiency and power generation for a thermoelectric module were 0.038, 0.063W and 0.063, 1.12 W, respectively at mean solar radiation intensity of 1004 W/m(2), and electrical power generation rates of PV collector at this point for the two modes were obtained to be 0.11 W and 0.119W, respectively. These values indicate the positive effect of thermoelectric modules on the refrigeration and increased electrical efficiency of the collector.

AB Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) are oleaginous insects that can assimilate organic waste for fat accumulation, and thus serve as an alternative feedstock for biodiesel production. In lipase-catalyzed transesterification, enzymes are deactivated by excess methanol. To address this obstacle, methyl acetate is suggested as an alternative acyl acceptor to methanol. In this study, methyl acetate was first used in the enzymatic production of biodiesel with BSFL as a triglyceride source. The interesterification of BSFL fat with methyl acetate was catalyzed using Novozym 435 as an efficient immobilized lipase. Response surface methodology was used to optimize the reaction and establish a reliable mathematical model for prediction. A maximum biodiesel yield of 96.97% was reached at a reaction time of 12 h, molar ratio of methyl acetate to fat of 14.64: 1, enzyme loading of 17.58%, and temperature of 39.5 degrees C. Under these optimal reaction conditions, Novozym 435 could be reused for up to 20 cycles "without loss in enzyme activity. The properties of BSFL biodiesel were also investigated and all met the European standard EN 14214. This study indicates that the enzymatic interesterification of BSFL fat with methyl acetate is a promising and ecofriendly method for green fuel production.

AB Combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) systems, which have the advantages of energy saving and environmental protection, have attracted more and more attentions. Great deals of works have been done, but most of them are theoretical research. It is still lack of experimental research for large scale CCHP system in practical application, and an overall off-design thermodynamic model is also desired to simulate or exam the system performance. In this work, a novel CCHP system integrated with dehumidification system is proposed for further utilizing waste heat, in which an internal combustion engine (ICE) is used as prime mover, its heat of flue gas and the heat of jacket water above 81 degrees C are used to drive absorption chiller, and the heat of jacket water below 81 degrees C is used to drive absorption dehumidifier. A comprehensive off-design thermodynamic model and evaluation of the system is established. The tested results of a MW CCHP system integrated with dehumidification system are used to validate the model, and the thermodynamic performance analysis is also carried out. The thermodynamic performance comparison between the CCHP system integrated with dehumidification system and conventional CCHP system has been done. The results show that: the simulated values are basically in keeping with those experimental results; when the output power of ICE is 1200 kW, the primary energy rate of the MW CCHP system can go up to 84.0%, the primary energy saving ratio achieves 32.77%, and exergy efficiency is 42.45%; the thermodynamic performance of the proposed CCHP system is better than conventional CCHP system.

AB The impinging receiver is a new member of the cavity solar receiver family. In this paper, the transient performance of a prototype impinging receiver has been studied with the help of a Fresnel lens based solar simulator and an externally fired micro gas turbine. The impinging receiver can offer an air outlet temperature of 810 degrees C at an absorber temperature of 960 degrees C. The radiative-to-thermal efficiency is measured to be 74.1%. The absorber temperature uniformity is good but high temperature differences have been detected during the 'cold startup' process. The temperature changing rate of the receiver is within 3 degrees C/s for the startup process and 4 degrees C/s for the shut-down process. In order to avoid quenching effects caused by the impinging jets, the micro gas turbine should be turned off to stop the airflow when the radiative power is off.

AB This study presents the optimization of algal biomass catalytic gasification for hydrogen-rich gas production. Three operating parameters under varying conditions of temperature (700-900 degrees C), catalyst loading (5-20 wt%) and reaction time (15-40 min) were optimized. The central composite design (CCD) was used to perform optimization and to investigate the influence of operating parameters on response variables (fractions of H-2, CO, CO2 and CH4). The results indicated the temperature and catalyst loading as the most significant reaction parameters influencing H-2 production and reducing the tar produced during the gasification process. The highest H2 fraction of 48.95 mol% (18.77 mol kg-biomass(-1)) was obtained at an optimum condition at 851 degrees C with catalyst loading of 16.4 wt% and reaction time of 28.8 min. The high R-2 values of 0.98, 0.97, 0.95, and 0.90 corresponding to the response variables (H-2, CO, CO2 and CH4) showed paramount estimation of model.

AB In this paper, a novel integrated energy system driven by solar power is proposed. A concentrated solar trough system is utilized in integration with organic Rankine cycle, absorption cooling system, desalination unit and electrolyzer, for the purpose of polygeneration. The proposed system produces hydrogen, cooling, fresh water, and domestic hot water along with electric power production. The system is analyzed thermodynamically, and its overall performance is assessed through energy and exergy efficiencies. The effects of varying several operating parameters and conditions on the performance are investigated through parametric studies. The cost rate is estimated at different operating points. The overall thermoeconomic multi-objective optimization study shows two extremes of 39% and 21.7% as maximum and minimum overall exergy efficiencies, respectively, as achieved at cost rate of 309.56 $/h and 241.7 $/h, for each corresponding case, respectively.

AB Most installed phase change materials in real applications are typically spherical microencapsulated paraffin. However, salt hydrates can be a cheap alternative when combined with a suitable macroencapsulation. Such macroencapsulation enables the installation of different shapes and positions within the building material. Therefore, an experiment setup consisting of a wooden box equipped with infrared radiators and a cooler was used to investigate cuboid, cylindrical, plate-shaped, and spherical phase-change packages. All water vapor impermeable packages filled with salt hydrate were positioned within a standard concrete block. As a result, it can be seen that changing the design of a PCM package enables the opportunity to adjust the thermal behavior without changing the mass of the PCM. For a high heat transfer, a set up position of a large number of thin packages with a large heat transfer surface was found to be the best design. Using a thermal shading effect and an even distribution of the PCM within concrete block ensures a slow increase in the temperature of the block and thus a lower heat flow into the inner rooms.

AB A 100% renewable economy would give a lasting solution to the challenges raised by climate change, energy security, sustainability, and pollution. The conversion of the present transport system appears to be one of the most difficult aspects of such renewable transition. This study reviews the technologies and systems that are being proposed or proven as alternative to fossil-fuel based transportation, and their prospects for their entry into the post-carbon era, from both technological and energetic viewpoints. The energetic cost of the transition from the current transportation system into global 100% renewable transportation is estimated, as well as the electrical energy required for the operation of the new renewable transportation sector. A 100% renewable transport providing the same service as global transport in 2014 would demand about 18% less energy. The main reduction is expected in road transport (69%), but the shipping and air sectors would notably increase their consumptions: 163% and 149%, respectively. The analysis concludes that a 100% renewable transportation is feasible, but not necessarily compatible with indefinite increase of resources consumption. The major material and energy limitations and obstacles of each transport sector for this transition are shown.

AB The paper presents an exergo-economic analysis of humidification-dehumidification (HDH) desalination system operating under a conventional open-water open-air (OWOA) and a modified closed-water open-air (CWOA) configuration. Besides, the possibility of coupling a reverse osmosis (RO) system with HDH unit is also analyzed. The hybrid HDH-RO system is studied under three different retrofits including a simple HDH-RO, HDH-RO with a Pelton turbine and HDH-RO with a pressure exchanger. The analysis reveals that the modified cycle has a higher exergetic efficiency and lower product cost than the basic cycle. The product cost for the basic cycle with an electrical heater is calculated to be $6.56/m(3) and with the solar heater $5.98/m(3). Moreover, it is observed that the hybrid HDH-RO system with a pressure exchanger has the highest gained output ratio and second-law efficiency followed by HDH-RO with a Pelton turbine and simple HDH-RO, respectively. The product cost for hybrid HDH-RO with a pressure exchanger is calculated to be $0.13/m(3) and $0.12/m(3) with an electrical and solar heater, respectively.

AB In this study, microwave-assisted alkali pretreatment for brewers' spent grain (BSG) waste was comprehensively investigated using Box-Behnken design under varying operating parameters, i.e. microwave power, pretreatment time and alkali/biomass (A/B) ratio. Both quantitative and qualitative characterization analysis such as crystallinity index (CrI), specific surface area (SSA), morphology and compositional analyses were conducted on pretreated samples. Standard biomethane potential (BMP) tests were performed for each pretreated sample to observe the biomethane enhancement after pretreatment. Under optimized conditions, it was observed that the pretreatment technique has facilitated removal of 46% of lignin and 38% of hemicellulose and improved the SSA of samples from 9.55 to 161.98 m(2)/g, contributing to 52% increase in BMP value. Meanwhile, mathematical models with correlation coefficients of 97.9% and 98.2% respectively were built to predict both the soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) yield and BMP after pretreatment. Furthermore, a simplified concept of overall evaluation mechanism for pretreatment has been introduced, taking into account waste-removal, energetic and economic indices. Under the proposed evaluation mechanism, the caustic soda price was found to play a more important role than the prices of industry electricity and wholesale natural gas.

AB Energy demand in the transportation sector across Southeast Asian (SEA) region is rapidly increasing. This poses a challenge to the sector in mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because of its heavy reliance on fossil fuels. Decarbonisation efforts tend to focus on the use of low carbon energy, often neglecting frictional losses in vehicles. Therefore, the study aims to determine the fuel cost savings and the environmental impact from reduction of frictional energy losses in passenger cars and motorcycles for selected SEA countries. An energy analysis framework is proposed; estimating a total of USD 42.6 billion/year is wasted through fuel energy loss in moving these vehicles in the selected SEA countries, emitting 109 Mtonne/year of CO2. By implementing relevant tribological improvement strategies, fuel energy savings of USD 18.3 billion/year could be achieved, leading to 46.6 Mtonne/year of CO2 emissions reduction. This level of CO2 emissions reduction, obtained via friction reduction, can contribute between 0.8% and 1.9% towards the committed GHG reduction targets for the selected SEA countries by 2030. It is emphasised that combined effort, from vehicle manufacturers and end users, is required in implementing relevant friction reduction strategies to avoid backlash from inappropriate use of these strategies.

AB The thermal performance of stratospheric airship is closely related to the superheat/overpressure of airship, the thermal stress of the hull, the mechanics property of the envelope, as well as the airship reliability and lifetime. A comprehensive understanding of the thermal performance of the airship is important for the increase of airship applications. For the improved airship with rotatable photovoltaic array, the location of the photovoltaic array changes with time to utilize the solar radiation maximally, which decrease the mass of photovoltaic array greatly. The thermal performance may be different with the traditional airship with fixed photovoltaic array. In this paper, a thermal model of stratospheric airship with rotatable photovoltaic array was proposed to investigate the thermal performance and compare with traditional stratospheric airship with fixed photovoltaic array. A user define function program in computational fluid dynamic software was developed based on the model. The temperature distribution of surface and flow field of inner lifting gas of the airship with rotatable/fixed photovoltaic array were simulated and compared. The result shows that the temperatures of photovoltaic array and envelope of the improved airship are slight higher than that of traditional airship. The temperature fields of the Helium are also various and the uneven temperature distribution leads to the formation of eddies and chaotic state of the flow field. It is helpful in guiding the design of novel stratospheric airship with low weight power system, especially the design of thermal control system and inner pressure regulation system of the airship.

AB A two-dimensional numerical model is developed to simulate the behavior of a salt gradient solar pond (SGSP) of 1 x 1 x 1 m(3). The numerical code takes into consideration double-diffusive convection in the pond, solar radiation absorption through the horizontal fluid layers, and allows an appropriate treatment of the boundary conditions at the water free surface. The transient evolution of the SGSP covers the first 5 days of July 2011 under weather conditions of Marrakesh Morocco. The study aims to investigate qualitative and quantitative thermal performances of the considered pond. In addition, a stability analysis of the intermediate non-convective zone (NCZ) of the pond is performed. Flow velocities are solved using the Lattice-Boltzmann method with the Cascaded Multi-Relaxation-Time scheme (CMRT-LBM) while both temperature and salt concentration fields are computed by the Finite Volume (FV) approach. The obtained results show that the mean temperature in the heat storage zone (HSZ) increases each day with a rate around 5 degrees C. In the absence of heat extraction, the daily amount of energy accumulated in both heat storage zone and non-convective zone increases linearly during the simulation period to reach respectively 11.3 kWh and 5.9 kWh at the end of the simulation. The present study confirms the substantial capacity of storage in the SGSP and the ability of the elaborated model to describe the erosion of the non-convective zone by predicting the motion of its limiting interfaces.

AB Sewage sludge from wastewater treatment facilities needs to be treated before it can be disposed of. While it is typically processed through an anaerobic digestion process, sludge can also be a good feedstock for alternative fuel production. High-temperature steam gasification is a process that decomposes organic materials into synthesis gas (syngas) with a high hydrogen concentration. In this study, a lab-scale steam gasification system which converts sewage sludge into valuable syngas was developed and experimentally evaluated. This study specifically focuses on investigating the chemical kinetics of syngas generation and feedstock decomposition in a batch process. The syngas generation rates and concentrations of syngas constituents were measured, and changes in carbon balance during gasification were tracked with respect to time, which shows how reaction rates vary over time. It was found that variations in steam flow rates modified the gasification reactions both thermodynamically and hydrodynamically. The gasification processes were fitted into logistics curves to understand the effects of different steam flow rates. The results indicate that the chemical reaction velocity can be controlled to achieve optimum operating conditions, which potentially can reduce both processing time and steam consumption while maximizing the syngas yield. This study would contribute more to the complete understanding of the sewage sludge gasification processes and the kinetics of the gasification chemical reactions.

AB In this study, different feasible integrated configurations were proposed and thermodynamically evaluated for cogeneration of power and fresh water/cooling, and trigeneration of power, cooling and fresh water. A steam regenerative Rankine cycle with condensation and steam extractions, driven by a concentrated solar tower, was designed to supply the thermal heat requirements of absorption cooling and multi effect distillation, or thermal vapor compression-multi effect distillation. The results showed the configurations that utilize steam extraction with a lower temperature and pressure were more efficient. For power and fresh water cogeneration, utilizing the condensation steam to integrate multi effect distillation with a power cycle was thermodynamically more efficient than the integration of thermal vapor compression-multi effect distillation using extraction steams. Integrated Rankine cycle-multi effect distillation configuration was found to be very competitive with the direct supply of electricity to reverse osmosis systems, particularly at higher fresh water productions. However, further examinations are required considering geographical, environmental and economic factors. For power and cooling cogeneration, all proposed absorption cooling configurations were more efficient than supplying electricity directly to vapor compression cooling. Moreover, despite significantly lower steam requirements of double and triple effects absorption cooling, integration of a single effect absorption cooling to the power cycle was more efficient. The most efficient trigeneration configuration was identified when multi effect distillation and single effect absorption cooling were integrated to a Rankine cycle. The results and conclusions of this study can be generalized to other coal and natural gas power plants that employ similar Rankine cycle configurations.

AB The high-temperature heat transfer and thermochemical storage performances of dry reforming of methane in a foam reactor subjected to highly concentrated solar radiation is numerically investigated. Two new correlations for the volumetric heat transfer coefficient and the pressure-drop within foam structure are proposed through several experimental tests. Temperature and species distributions inside the reactor as well as the overall methane conversion and thermochemical energy storage efficiency under various operating conditions are predicted. The results indicate that the increase in inlet velocity and CH4/CO2 ratio produces a reduction in methane conversion, while increasing the solid-phase thermal conductivity promotes the conversion. The energy storage efficiency exhibits non-monotonous change with inlet velocity, feed ratio, and foam structural parameters. Compared to other foam structural parameter combinations, maximum conversion and efficiency are observed at porosity of 0.9 and pore diameter of 1.5 mm. Besides, the solid-phase thermal conductivity and foam structural parameters exert negligible effect on the H-2/CO ratio in the reforming process.

AB With the progression towards personalised and age-appropriate medicines, the production of drug loaded liposomes at the point of care would be highly desirable. In particular, liposomal solubilisation agents that can be produced rapidly and easily would provide a new option in personalised medicines. Such a process could also be used as a rapid tool for the formulation and pre-clinical screening of low soluble drugs. Within this paper, we outline a novel easy-to-use production method for point of use production of liposome solubilised drugs. Our results demonstrate that pre-formed multilamellar liposomes, stored in a fresh or frozen format, can be bilayer loaded with low solubility drugs using a simple bath sonication process. Sonication is undertaken in a sealed vial allowing the contents to remain sterile. Liposomes around 100 nm were prepared and these liposomes were able to increase the amount of drug dissolved by up to 10 fold. These liposomal solubilisation agents were stable in terms of size and drug solubilisation for up to 8 days when stored in the fridge making them an easy to use and robust small-scale tool for drug solubilisation.

AB In view of the increasing interest of pharmaceutical companies for cell-and tissue-free models to implement permeation into formulation testing, this study explored the capability of an artificial membrane insert system (AMI-system) as predictive tool to evaluate the performance of absorption-enabling formulations. Firstly, to explore the usefulness of the AMI-system in supersaturation assessment, permeation was monitored after induction of different degrees of loviride supersaturation. Secondly, to explore the usefulness of the AMI-system in formulation evaluation, a two-stage dissolution test was performed prior to permeation assessment. Different case examples were selected based on the availability of in vivo (intraluminal and systemic) data: (i) a suspension of posaconazole (Noxafil (R)), (ii) a cyclodextrin-based formulation of itraconazole (Sporanox (R)), and (iii) a micronized (Lipanthyl (R)) and nanosized (Lipanthylnano (R)) formulation of fenofibrate. The obtained results demonstrate that the AMI-system is able to capture the impact of loviride supersaturation on permeation. Furthermore, the AMI-system correctly predicted the effects of (i) formulation pH on posaconazole absorption, (ii) dilution on cyclodextrin-based itraconazole absorption, and (iii) food intake on fenofibrate absorption. Based on the applied in vivo/in vitro approach, the AMI-system combined with simple dissolution testing appears to be a time-and cost-effective tool for the early-stage evaluation of absorption-enabling formulations.

AB We investigated the formation and stabilization mechanisms of indomethacin (IMC)/poloxamer 407 nanosuspensions. Stable nanosuspensions were prepared via 24 h wet-milling of three IMC forms (gamma form, alpha form, and amorphous) with poloxamer 407. Cryogenic-transmission electron microscopy images of nanoparticles obtained using gamma-form IMC indicated a rhombic-plate shape. In contrast, needle-like nanoparticles were observed in the nanosuspensions of alpha-form and amorphous IMC. Suspended-state cross polarization C-13 NMR and Raman measurements directly detected the molecular states of IMC in nanosuspensions. IMC existed in its initial crystal form when gamma-form and alpha-form IMC were used; amorphous IMC transformed into crystalline alpha-form IMC. Suspended-state C-13 pulse saturation transfer NMR measurements revealed the molecular state of poloxamer 407 on the surface of IMC crystals. The polypropylene oxide group adsorbed to the IMC crystal surface via hydrophobic interactions, while the polyethylene oxide group on the surface was as flexible as that in polymeric micelles. The equilibrium of poloxamer 407 between micelle and nanocrystal surfaces was slower than the NMR time scale, which could stabilize the dispersion of the nanoparticles in water. The time interval evaluation during the wet-milling process revealed that alpha-form IMC nanocrystals could be efficiently prepared via wet-milling using amorphous IMC as the starting material.

Formulation parameters such as PLGA molecular weight, concentration of ATV and PLGA in the coating solution and number of coatings were investigated to optimise the mesh in terms of drug loading efficacy, drug release kinetics and mechanical properties. Using the dip-coating technique, 1.6 mg of ATV was loaded on a tubular 5 cm long mesh. The most important parameter influencing ATV loading was the concentration of the drug in the coating solution. In vitro an ATV release profile combining an initial fast release over 3 days and a sustained release over 40 days was obtained; consistent with the timeframe of hyperplasia development. The amount of PLGA polymer coating as well as the molecular weight of the polymer were optimized to achieve these kinetics. A poly(D, L-lactide-co-caprolactone) (PLCL) layer was sprayed on the external side of the PLGA coated tubular mesh to restrict the ATV release to the vascular tissue. Scanning electron microscopy observation showed that the macroporosity of the mesh was preserved after coating, while texture analysis demonstrated that its elasticity decreased slightly.

AB The aim of this work was to characterize in vitro and ex vivo the performances of Durogesic and of two bioequivalent generic products, by evaluating: (a) fentanyl release; (b) fentanyl permeation across porcine skin and (c) fentanyl ease of extraction. Additional characteristics studied are the effect of temperature and skin integrity, applied individually or combined, to check a possible synergism. The two generic patches resulted equivalent to the originator according to the new Guideline. Nevertheless, the same data reported in a different way, i.e. considering the total amount of drug permeated from the whole patch over the application time, highlight differences among the patches. The additional tests performed showed that skin integrity does not represent a barrier for fentanyl permeation across the skin, regardless of the type and complexity of the patch. The effect of temperature resulted critical for two out of three patches, probably due to the different composition and to the different structure. The combination of skin damage and elevated temperature did not produce a synergistic effect. Fentanyl extraction was different for the different products and variable according to the conditions used.
   The results reported in the present work underline the influence of patch composition and complexity on fentanyl extraction, release and skin permeation, in particular in conditions that can be critical, such as elevated temperature. In particular, the effect of critical variables, such as skin integrity and temperature, should be addressed to in the development of a new or new generic patch and new discriminant tests should be developed.

AB Mechanofusion is a dry coating method that can be used to improve the flowability of cohesive powder by coating host particles with a lubricant, for example magnesium stearate (MgSt). It has been shown previously that fragmenting material can under some circumstances be mechanofused with MgSt without impairing compactibility of the powder and without reducing the dissolution rate of the resulting tablets. However, the effects on material with viscoelastic behaviour, known to be sensitive for the negative effects of MgSt, is not known. Therefore, mechanofusion of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) with MgSt was investigated in this study. Four MCC grades were mechanofused with different MgSt concentrations and process parameters, and the resulting flowability and compactibility were studied. Starting materials and low-shear blended binary mixtures were studied as a reference. Mechanofusion improved the flow properties of small particle size MCC powders (d50 < 78 mu m) substantially, but increasing the MgSt content consequently resulted in weaker tablets. Larger particle size MCC grades, however, fractured under the shear forces during the mechanofusion process and hence their flow properties were decreased. Improvement of the flow properties but also the negative effects on compactibility of small particle size grades were observed even at relatively mild mechanofusion parameters and low lubricant concentrations.

AB Poor solubility of drug compounds is a great issue in drug industry today and decreasing particle size is one efficient and simple way to overcome this challenge. Drug nanocrystals are solid nanosized drug particles, which are covered by a stabilizer layer. In nanoscale many physical properties, like compound solubility, are different from the solubility of bulk material, and due to this drug nanocrystals can reach supersaturation as compared to thermodynamic solubility. The most important effect of the smaller particle size is that dissolution rate is highly enhanced mainly due to the increased surface area. In this review the most important properties of nanocrystalline drug compounds are presented, with multiple examples of the development and characterization of nanocrystalline drug formulations.

AB Pharmaceutical tablets are typically manufactured by the uni-axial compaction of powder that is confined radially by a rigid die. The directional nature of the compaction process yields not only anisotropic mechanical properties (e.g. tensile strength) but also directional properties of the pore structure in the porous compact. This study derives a new quantitative parameter, S-a, to describe the anisotropy in pore structure of pharmaceutical tablets based on terahertz time-domain spectroscopy measurements. The S-a parameter analysis was applied to three different data sets including tablets with only one excipient (functionalised calcium carbonate), samples with one excipient (microcrystalline cellulose) and one drug (indomethacin), and a complex formulation (granulated product comprising several excipients and one drug). The overall porosity, tablet thickness, initial particle size distribution as well as the granule density were all found to affect the significant structural anisotropies that were observed in all investigated tablets. The S-a parameter provides new insights into the microstructure of a tablet and its potential was particularly demonstrated for the analysis of formulations comprising several components. The results clearly indicate that material attributes, such as particle size and granule density, cause a change of the pore structure, which, therefore, directly impacts the liquid imbibition that is part of the disintegration process. We show, for the first time, how the granule density impacts the pore structure, which will also affect the performance of the tablet. It is thus of great importance to gain a better understanding of the relationship of the physical properties of material attributes (e.g. intragranular porosity, particle shape), the compaction process and the microstructure of the finished product.

AB The effect of high pressure homogenization (HPH) on the structure of beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg) was studied by combining spectroscopic, chromatographic, and electrophoretic methods. The consequences of the resulting structure modifications on oil/water (O/W) interfacial properties were also assessed. Moderated HPH treatment (100 MPa/4 cycles) showed no significant modification of protein structure and interfacial properties. However, a harsher HPH treatment (300 MPa/5 cycles) induced structural transformation, mainly from beta-sheets to random coils, wide loss in lipocalin core, and protein aggregation via intermolecular disulfide bridges. HPH-modified beta-lg displayed higher surface hydrophobicity leading to a faster adsorption rate at the interface and an earlier formation of an elastic interfacial film at C beta-lg= 0.1 wt%. However, no modification of the interfacial properties was observed at C beta-lg= 1 wt%. At this protein concentration, the prior denaturation of beta-lg by HPH did not modify the droplet size of nanoemulsions prepared with these beta-lg solutions as the aqueous phases. A slightly increased creaming rate was however observed. The effects of HPH and heat denaturations appeared qualitatively similar, but with differences in their extent.

AB The aim of our work was to study and define a computationally-based adiabatic scale-up methodology for a hot-melt extrusion (HME) process to produce an amorphous solid dispersion (ASD). As a drug product becomes commercially viable, there is a need for scaling up the manufacturing process. In the case of HME used for the formation of ASDs, scale-up can be challenging due to the fundamental differences in how heat is generated in extruders of differing scale, i.e. conduction vs. viscous dissipation and the significant role heat generation plays in determining the final product attributes. Using a 30% w/w dipyridamole-in-copovidone formulation, 11 mm-, 16 mm-and 24 mm-diameter extruders with L/D 40, solid-state characterization tools, a geometric scaling equation, and Ludovic (R) twin-screw extrusion software, we compared the total imparted material energy, the conducted energy and the difference between barrel and melt temperature at die exit for various feed rates and screw speeds. Numerical simulation identified desirable adiabatic conditions at multiple extruder scales in agreement with the chosen scaling factor. With the use of computational tools, the energetics in an extrusion process can be evaluated and processing conditions can be selected to identify the most efficient scaling of a HME process.

AB Preprocessing of pharmaceutical powders is a common procedure to condition the materials for a better manufacturing performance. However, such operations may induce undesired material properties modifications when conditioning particle size through milling, for example. Modification of both surface and bulk material structure will change the material properties, thus affecting the processability of the powder. Hence it is essential to control the material transformations that occur during milling. Topographical and mechanical changes in surface properties can be a preliminary indication of further material transformations. Therefore a surface evaluation of the alpha-lactose monohydrate after short and prolonged milling times has been performed. Unprocessed alpha-lactose monohydrate and spray dried lactose were evaluated in parallel to the milled samples as reference examples of the crystalline and amorphous lactose structure. Morphological differences between un-processed a-lactose, 1 h and 20 h milled lactose and spray dried lactose were detected from SEM and AFM images. Additionally, AFM was used to simultaneously characterize particle surface amorphicity by measuring energy dissipation. Extensive surface amorphicity was detected after 1 h of milling while prolonged milling times showed only a moderate particle surface amorphisation. Bulk material characterization performed with DSC indicated a partial amorphicity for the 1 h milled lactose and a fully amorphous thermal profile for the 20 h milled lactose. The temperature profiles however, were shifted somewhat in the comparison to the amorphous reference, particularly after extended milling, suggesting a different amorphous state compared to the spraydried material. Water loss during milling was measured with TGA, showing lower water content for the lactose amorphized through milling compared to spray dried amorphous lactose. The combined results suggest a surface-bulk propagation of the amorphicity during milling in combination with a different amorphous structural conformation to that of the amorphous spray dried lactose. The hardened surface may be due to either surface crystallization of lactose or to formation of a low-water glass transition.

AB Polymyxin B is a polycationic antibiotic used as the last line treatment against antibiotic-resistant Gram negative bacteria. However, application of polymyxin B is limited because of its toxicity effects. Herein, we used bare and surface modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) with an average diameter of 72.29 +/- 8.17 nm as adsorbent for polymyxin B to improve its therapeutic properties. The polymyxin B adsorption onto MSN surfaces was explained as a function of pH, type of buffer and surface charge of nanoparticles, according to the zeta-potential of silica nanoparticles and adsorption kinetics results. The highest value of the adsorption capacity (about 401 +/- 15.38 mg polymyxin B/g silica nanoparticles) was obtained for the bare nanoparticles in Tris buffer, pH 9. Release profiles of polymyxin B showed a sustained release pattern, fitting Power law and Hill models. The antibiotic molecules-loaded nanoparticles showed enhanced antibacterial activity compared to free antibiotic against different Gram negative bacteria. Biocompatibility evaluation results revealed that loading of polymyxin B onto MSNs can decrease the cytotoxicity effects of the drug by reducing ROS generation. Our results suggest that formulation of drugs by adsorption onto MSNs may offer a way forward to overcome the adverse effects of some antibiotics such as polymyxin B without compromising their antimicrobial properties.

AB Hemorrhagic shock, caused by trauma, is a leading cause of preventable death. A combination treatment of D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and melatonin (MLT), in dimethyl sulfoxide - water, increased survival. A freeze-dried BHB-MLT formulation, with a short reconstitution time, has been developed. This intravenous formulation, prepared with an aqueous vehicle, completely eliminated dimethyl sulfoxide, thereby avoiding the potential problems associated with this solvent. The poor aqueous solubility of MLT necessitated the use of poly-vinylpyrrolidine (PVP) as a complexing agent. Thus the prelyophilization solution contained BHB (2 M), MLT (21.5 mM) and PVP (40 mM). Using a combination of low-temperature X-ray diffractometry and thermal analysis, the lyophilization process parameters were optimized. Infra-red spectra revealed hydrogen bonding interaction between PVP and MLT, while BHB crystallized as BHB. 0.25 H2O in the final lyophile. The formulation improved survival in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock. Based on the increase in rate of survival and longer survival time compared to untreated animals, we conclude that this formulation can serve as a promising first line of treatment for hemorrhagic shock.

AB This study aimed to demonstrate that organic anion transporters (OATs) mediate the drug-drug interaction (DDI) between piperacillin and tazobactam. After co-administration with piperacillin in rats, the AUC of tazobactam in plasma was significantly increased, and t(1/2 beta) was prolonged with significant reduction in plasma clearance, renal clearance and cumulative urinary excretion. In rat and human kidney slices, probenecid, p-aminohippurate and benzylpenicillin inhibited the uptake of piperacillin and tazobactam. Piperacillin significantly inhibited the uptake of tazobactam. Moreover, the uptakes of piperacillin, tazobactam and sulbactam in hOAT1/3-HEK293 cells were significantly higher compared with mock-HEK293 cells, respectively. Piperacillin significantly inhibited the uptake of tazobactam in hOAT1/3-HEK293 cells. The K-m values of tazobactam (431 +/- 67 mu M for hOAT1, 377 +/- 63 mu M for hOAT3) were significantly higher than those of piperacillin (37 +/- 5 mu M for hOAT1, 172 +/- 28 mu M for hOAT3). This suggested that piperacillin has a stronger affinity to hOAT1/3 than tazobactam. Meanwhile, the Km values of tazobactam were increased in the presence of piperacillin with unchanged V-max. This indicated that piperacillin inhibited the uptake of tazobactam in a competitive manner. In conclusion, piperacillin and tazobactam are the substrates of hOAT1/3, and OAT1/3 mediate the DDI between piperacillin and tazobactam.

AB A comprehensive commercial control strategy for tablet content and content uniformity focussed on the unit operation of compression is presented and is proposed to enable real time release for these critical quality attributes. The control strategy is based on process understanding, process control through compaction force weight control on the tablet press, periodic checks of mean and individual tablet weight combined with at-line testing of tablet content by near infrared (NIR). The application of the at-line NIR tablet content method is discussed and an acceptance criteria based on a parametric tolerance interval test (PTIT) is proposed. Sample handling limitations and spectral acquisition time for the NIR content method limit the sample size, however the chosen PTIT assures an appropriate level of batch coverage. Data are presented for ten commercial-scale batches that demonstrates the control strategy delivered the quality standard for content and content uniformity.

AB The trend towards continuous manufacturing in the pharmaceutical industry is associated with an increasing demand for advanced control strategies. It is a mandatory requirement to obtain reliable real-time information on critical quality attributes (CQA) during every process step as the decision on diversion of material needs to be performed fast and automatically. Where possible, production equipment should provide redundant systems for in-process control (IPC) measurements to ensure continuous process monitoring even if one of the systems is not available. In this paper, two methods for real-time monitoring of granule moisture in a semi-continuous fluid-bed drying unit are compared. While near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has already proven to be a suitable process analytical technology (PAT) tool for moisture measurements in fluid-bed applications, microwave resonance technology (MRT) showed difficulties to monitor moistures above 8% until recently. The results indicate, that the newly developed MRT sensor operating at four resonances is capable to compete with NIR spectroscopy. While NIR spectra were preprocessed by mean centering and first derivative before application of partial least squares (PLS) regression to build predictive models (RMSEP = 0.20%), microwave moisture values of two resonances sufficed to build a statistically close multiple linear regression (MLR) model (RMSEP = 0.07%) for moisture prediction. Thereby, it could be verified that moisture monitoring by MRT sensor systems could be a valuable alternative to NIR spectroscopy or could be used as a redundant system providing great ease of application.

AB Protein aggregation is a major challenge in the development of biopharmaceuticals. As the pathways of aggregation are manifold, good understanding of the mechanisms behind is essential. Particularly, the presence of liquid-air interfaces has been identified to trigger the formation of large protein particles. Investigations of two monoclonal antibodies (IgGs) at the liquid-air interface exhibited the formation of a highly compressible film. An inhomogeneous protein distribution across the interface with areas of increased packing density was discovered by Brewster-Angle microscopy. Repeated compression and decompression of the film resulted in a considerable hysteresis and in significantly elevated numbers of particles. Furthermore, the extent and speed of compression directly affected the mechanical properties of the film as well as the number of particles formed. Infrared reflection- absorption spectroscopy did not indicate considerable changes in secondary structure compared to FT-IR spectra in solution. Hence, the IgG remains in a native-like conformation at the interface.
   Consequently, the physical-chemical methods applied in combination with the newly-designed Mini-trough provided substantial new knowledge of the mechanisms of interface-related protein aggregation and enable testing of different formulations under controlled stress conditions. Pure compression and decompression with a Mini-Trough allows a much more controlled stressing than shaking.

AB The mucus layer covering all mucosal surfaces in our body is the first barrier encountered by drugs before their potential absorption through epithelial tissues, and could thus affect the drugs' permeability and their effectiveness. Therefore, it is of key importance to have in vitro permeability models that can mimic this specific environment. For this purpose, the novel mucus phospholipid vesicle-based permeation assay (mucus-PVPA)has been developed and used for permeability screening of drugs and formulations. The model proved to be stable under the chosen conditions and demonstrated the ability to discriminate between compounds with different chemical structures and properties. Overall, a decrease in drug permeability was found in the presence of mucus on top of the PVPA barriers, as expected. Moreover, mucoadhesive (chitosan-coated) and mucopenetrating (PEGylated) liposomes were investigated in the newly developed model. The mucus-PVPA was able to distinguish between the different liposomal formulations, confirming the penetration potential of the tested formulations and the related drug permeability. The mucus-PVPA model appears to be a promising in vitro tool able to mimic the environment of mucosal tissues, and could therefore be used for further drug permeability screening and formulation development.

The optimized formulation of PTX-loaded CSTGA-PF liposomes showed particle size of 121.4 nm and zeta potential of 50.2 mV. CS-TGA-PF liposomes were more stable than unmodified liposomes and demonstrated a sustained-release manner of PTX incubated in simulated gastric fluid and intestinal fluid. CS-TGA-PF liposomes absorbed a three-fold amount of mucin compared with that of unmodified liposomes, which would prolong the residence time of liposomes on the mucosal surface in the intestinal tract. The intestinal mucus adhesion-and penetration-enhanced efficacy of CS-TGA-PF liposomes for intestinal PTX delivery was studied by observing the intestinal absorption and distribution. Results exhibited increased liposome uptake by the GI mucosa and improved drug intestinal absorption. In conclusion, the dual functional CS-TGA-PF liposomes with mucus adhesion-and permeation-enhanced properties could be used as a promising nanodrug delivery system for PTX oral delivery.

AB Triiodothyronine (T3), a thyroid hormone synthesized and secreted by the thyroid gland, plays an essential role in morphogenesis and differentiation through interaction with its nuclear receptors (TRs). However, there are increasing evidences for its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) suppression. The aim of this work was to develop an effective hepatocellular carcinoma targeting drug delivery system to improve T3 delivery to hepatic cancer cells as well as to reduce toxic side effects. Three different liposomal systems, such as unmodified, Stealth (PEGylated) and Lactoferrin (Lf)-modified-Stealth liposomes were successfully prepared by the film hydration method, and fully characterized. Liposome cell interactions and cellular uptake were evaluated in three different HCC target cells (FaO, HepG2 and SKHep) by confocal microscopy. Finally, in vitro cytotoxicity studies were carried out by using MTT assay to evaluate toxicity of the liposome delivery system and to test the effect of T3 when incorporated into liposomes. Internalization studies, performed using Lf-modified-liposomes labeled with the lipophilic marker Rho-PE and loaded with the hydrophilic probe CF, clearly demonstrated the effective internalization of both hydrophilic and lipophilic markers. Lf-liposomes might markedly enhance the specific cell binding and cellular uptake in hepatoma cells due to the mediating of Lf that could bind with high affinity to multiple receptors on cell surface, such as ASGP-R. Results obtained from this study highlight that the Lfmodified-liposomal delivery system may ensure a specific and sustained T3 delivery, thus, allowing reduced therapeutic doses and deleterious side effects of T3.

AB Anti-inflammatory enzymes promote the dissolution and excretion of sticky phlegm, clean the wound surface and accelerate drug diffusion to the lesion. They play important roles in treating different types of inflammation and pain. Currently, various formulations of anti-inflammatory enzymes are successfully prepared to improve the enzymatic characteristics, pharmacokinetic properties and anti-inflammatory efficacies. The work was performed by systematically searching all available literature. An overall summary of current research about various anti-inflammatory enzymes and their novel formulations is presented. The original and improved enzymatic characteristics, pharmacokinetic properties, action mechanisms, clinical information, storage and shelf life, treatment efficacies of anti-inflammatory enzymes and their different formulations are summarized. The influencing factors such as enzyme type, source, excipient, pharmaceutical technique, administration route and dosage are analyzed. The combined application of enzymes and other drugs are included in this paper. Antiinflammatory enzymes were widely applied in treating different types of inflammation and diseases with accompanying edema. Their novel formulations increased enzymatic stabilities, improved pharmacokinetic properties, provided different administration routes, and enhanced anti-inflammatory efficacies of anti-inflammatory enzymes but decreased side effects and toxicity. Novel enzyme formulations improve and expand the usage of anti-inflammatory enzymes.

AB Herein, a hybrid hydrogel/microsphere system is introduced for accelerated wound healing by sustained release of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The hydrogel is composed of a mixture of PVA, gelatin and chitosan. The double-emulsion-solvent-evaporation method was utilized to obtain microspheres composed of PCL, as the organic phase, and PVA, as the aqueous phase. Subsequently, various in-vitro and in-vivo assays were performed to characterize the system. BSA was used to optimize the release mechanism, and encapsulation efficiency in microspheres, where a combination of 3% (w/v) PCL and 1% (w/v) PVA was found to be the optimum microsphere sample. Incorporation of microspheres within the hydrogel substrate also led to a zero-order release kinetics. Results from SEM images, also represented an average porosity of 54%, and average mean pore size of 35 +/- 7 mu m for the hydrogel system, and the diameter of 5 +/- 2 mu m for the microspheres. Moreover, in vivo study including wound healing process, and histological analysis regarding re-epithelization, angiogenesis, inflammation, fibroblast genesis and collagen formation were performed using Hematoxyline-Eosin (H&E) staining, Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) staining and Masson's Trichrome staining. In-vivo results represented that sustained delivery of bFGF promoted by biocompatibility of PVA/chitosan/gelatin hydrogel, significantly contribute to accelerated wound healing.

AB A Therapeutic Nipple Shield (TNS) was previously developed to respond to the global need for new infant therapeutic delivery technologies. However, the release efficiency for the same Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) from different therapeutic matrices within the TNS formulation has not yet been investigated. To address this, in-vitro release of elemental zinc into human milk from two types of Texel non-woven fibre mats of varying thickness and different gram per square meter values, placed inside the TNS was explored and compared to the release from zinc-containing rapidly disintegrating tablets. In-vitro delivery was performed by means of a breastfeeding simulation apparatus, with human milk flow rates and suction pressure adjusted to physiologically relevant values, and release was quantified using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES). It was found that a total recovery of 62-64 % elemental zinc was obtained after the human milk had passed through the fibre insert, amounting to a 20-48% increase compared to previous zinc delivery studies using rapidly disintegrating tablets within the TNS. This indicates that non-woven Texel fibre mats were identified as the superior dosage form for oral zinc delivery into human milk using a TNS.

AB Kale (Brassica oleracea var. acephala) is a rich source of numerous health-benefiting compounds, including vitamins, glucosinolates, phenolic compounds, and carotenoids. However, the genetic resources for exploiting the phyto-nutritional traits of kales are limited. To acquire precise information on secondary metabolites in kales, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome of green and red kale seedlings. Kale transcriptome datasets revealed 37,149 annotated genes and several secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes. HPLC analysis revealed 14 glucosinolates, 20 anthocyanins, 3 phenylpropanoids, and 6 carotenoids in the kale seedlings that were examined. Red kale contained more glucosinolates, anthocyanins, and phenylpropanoids than green kale, whereas the carotenoid contents were much higher in green kale than in red kale. Ultimately, our data will be a valuable resource for future research on kale bio-engineering and will provide basic information to define gene-to-metabolite networks in kale.

AB Genome flanking regions surrounding transcription start sites (TSSs) are critical for the regulation of gene expression, containing many translational regulatory elements. To investigate whether critical single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) exist around TSSs in the dairy goat genome, we performed high throughput DNA sequencing to compare two dairy goat groups with discrepant litter sizes. After genome mapping, SNP calling, and annotation, we screened the SNPs within 2 kb scales surrounding annotated TSSs in high fecundity (HF) and low fecundity (LF) groups, respectively. We attempted to identify distinct SNPs and motifs near the TSSs in both groups. The SNPs near the TSSs most were consistent; 318 new SNPs were uncovered in the HF group, of which 305 were heterozygote SNPs, 13 were homozygote SNPs, and majority of which were distributed on chromosome 2 and 29. After validation by Sanger sequencing we found that a SNP in CHI16: 27612330 C > A in the PSEN2 gene presented an A/A genotype in the HF group and an A/A or A/C genotype in the LF group. In conclusion, our study provides insightful information into the dairy goat genomic variations surrounding TSSs, which may contribute to enhanced litter size. Based on comparison studies of SNPs exist around transcription start sites between high fecundity group and low fecundity group. Our finding provides insights concerning the goat litter size phenotypic and will promote future goat breeding.

AB The apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a key component of several lipoproteins involved in lipid homeostasis. In this study, two cDNA sequences encoding ApoE (referred to as apoEa and apoEb) were characterized in the flatfish Solea senegalensis. The predicted peptides contained conserved structural blocks related with their capacity for lipid binding and lipoprotein receptor interaction. At genomic level, both genes contained five exons and four introns and they were organized into two tandem arrays with apoA-IV gene copies. The phylogenetic analysis clearly separated them into two well-supported clusters that matched with their organization in the genome of teleosts. Whole-mount in situ hybridization located the apoEa signal in the yolk syncytial layer (YSL) of lecito-throphic larval stages (0 dph) and in the anterior intestine of exotrophic larvae and benthic fish. In the case of apoEb, hybridization signals were located in the YSL, tail bud, eyes and mouth at 0 dph and in the otic vesicle, hindbrain, eyes, pharynx, mouth, heart and intestine at 1 dph. In exotrophic larvae, apoEb was ubiquitously expressed in several tissues such as taste buds, brain, mouth, nostril, gills, intestine, liver and around the neuromasts and eyes. Quantification of mRNA levels in pools of whole larvae confirmed distinct expression patterns with a significant reduction of apoEa and an increase of apoEb mRNA levels throughout larval development. Moreover, only apoEa transcripts increased in response to food supply suggesting that this paralog mostly participates in the absorption and transport of dietary lipids and the apoEb in the redistribution of endogenous lipids as well as in neural tissue regeneration.

AB Adipokines are secreted by adipose tissue and play an important role in the regulation of lipid metabolism. However, the information regarding adipokines in goats is limited. PPAR gamma is a key gene in adipocyte differentiation and activates adipokine genes. Rosiglitazone is a PPAR gamma agonist and can promote the expression of PPAR gamma to increase the expression of lipogenesis-related genes. Therefore, investigation of the relationship between rosiglitazone and adipokines will help us to better understand the function of PPAR gamma in lipid metabolism in Tibetan goats. In this study, we cloned the resistin (RETN), apelin (APLN), fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), and visfatin (NAMPT) genes from non-pregnant female Tibetan goat adipose tissue. APLN and NAMPT were predominantly expressed in the kidney, and FGF21 was expressed at the highest levels in the liver in vivo. In fat tissues, the highest expression levels of FGF21 and RETN were detected in omental fat, whereas their expression in perirenal and subcutaneous fat was extremely weak. APLN and NAMPT were abundantly expressed in omental and subcutaneous fat in vivo. In addition, the four adipokines had different expression profiles during goat adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Oil red 0 staining showed that rosiglitazone could promote adipocyte differentiation and lipid droplet formation. In addition, rosiglitazone significantly increased the expression of FGF21 and RETN < 0.05) but decreased the expression of APLN and NAMPT (p < 0.05). These results suggest that the four adipocytokine genes may have different roles during goat adipocyte differentiation. And PPAR gamma could regulate the expression of the four adipokines, but the detailed regulatory mechanism still needs to be elucidated.

AB OCT4 is known as the gatekeeper of pluripotent embryonic state as it is responsible for maintenance of pluripotency via self-renewal of embryonic stem cells and acquisition of induced pluripotency via somatic cell reprogramming. OCT4 is responsible for oncogenic transformation by disrupting pre-scheduled differentiation programs and in general, favoring evolution of cancer cells into a more aggressive cancer stein cell phenotype. In this study, we have investigated in details, the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms responsible for over-expression and subsequent aberrant function of OCT4 in breast cancer. Expression of OCT4 in breast cancer tissues and cell lines was determined by qRT-PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry followed by investigation of pro-tumorigenic properties such as cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis by gene knockdown and treatment with epigenetic modulators. Ectopic treatment of epigenetic modulators was done followed by MS-PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation. OCT4 is over-expressed in both of the breast cancer cell lines; MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 and its inhibition resulted in drastic decrease in rate of cell proliferation, metastatic ability and induced apoptosis. After treatment with epigenetic modulators, general increase in expression of OCT4 was observed at both gene and protein levels; however, changes of promoter DNA methylation was not found to be significant during OCT4 over-expression. Active histone marks especially H3K4me3 and H3K9acS10p were enriched in the promoter region with very low levels of repressive marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 indicating that active histone modifications are the deciding factor in inducing over-expression of OCT4 during breast carcinogenesis. These findings could provide the basis on which epigenetic therapy, targeting reversible epigenetic modifications and their perpetuating enzymes, can be designed for effective treatment of aggressive breast cancer.

AB Background: Chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) is the most common form of primary glomerular disease with unclear molecular mechanisms, which related to immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Our study intended to identify potential long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and genes, and to determine the potential molecular mechanisms of CGN pathogenesis.
   Methods: The microarray of GSE64265 and GSE46295 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, GSE64265 including 3 rats control kidney tissues and 5 rats model kidney tissues, GSE46295 including 3 rats control kidney tissues and 3 rats model kidney tissues, which was on the basis of GPL1355 platform. Identification of differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were performed between the 2 groups. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to analyze the biological functions and pathways for the differentially expressed mRNAs. LncRNA-mRNA weighted co-expression network was constructed using the WGCNA package to analyses for the genes in the modules. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was visualized.
   Results: A total of 40 significantly up-regulated and 24 down-regulated incRNAs, 653 up-regulated and 128 down-regulated mRNAs were identified. Additionally, Cdk1, with the highest connectivity degree in PPI network, was noteworthy enriched in cell cycle. Seven lncRNAs: NONRATT026650, LOC102547664, NONRATT77021989, NONRATT012453, LOC102551856, LOC102553536 and NONRATT7047175 were observed in the modules of lncRNA-mRNA weighted co-expression network.
   Conclusions: LncRNAs NONRATT026650, LOC102547664, NONRATT77021989, NONRATT012453, LOC102551856, LOC102553536 and NONRATT7047175 were differentially expressed and might play important roles in the development of CGN. Key genes, such as Cd44, Rftn1, Runx1, may be crucial biomarkers for CGN.

AB Macrophage foam cell formation is a key initiating event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. This work was conducted to determine the role of microRNA (miR)-212 in the transformation of foam cells from macrophages. We examined the expression of miR-212 in atherosclerotic lesions in an apoE-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mouse model. The effects of miR-212 overexpression and knockdown on lipid accumulation and cholesterol homeostasis in THP-1 macrophages after exposure to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). The mechanism underlying the activity of miR-212 was explored. It was found that miR-212 was downregulated in atherosclerotic lesions and macrophages from apoE-/- mice fed high-fat diet, compared to the equivalents from apoE-/- mice fed standard diet. Overexpression of miR-212 promoted lipid accumulation in oxLDL-treated THP-1 macrophages, whereas miR-212 depletion exerted an opposite effect. Macrophage cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I was significantly reduced by miR-212, which was accompanied by reduced ABCA1 expression. Mechanistically, miR-212 targeted sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) to repress the expression of ABCA1 in THP-1 macrophages. Rescue experiments confirmed that co-expression of SIRT1 attenuated lipid accumulation and restored cholesterol efflux in miR-212-overexpressing THP-1 macrophages. Collectively, miR-212 facilitates macrophage foam cell formation and suppresses ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux through downregulation of SIRT1. Targeting miR-212 may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for atherosclerosis.

AB Salvia miltiorrhiza (S. miltiorrhiza) and Salvia castanea Diels f. tomentosa (S. castanea) are both used for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. They have the same bioactive compound tanshinones, but whose contents are hugely different. This study illustrated diverse responses of tanshinone biosynthesis to yeast extract (YE) and Ag+ in hairy roots of the two species. YE enhanced both the growth and tanshinone biosynthesis of two hairy roots, and contributed more to tanshinone accumulation in S. castanea than that in S. miltiorrhiza. Genes encoding 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS2), geranylgeranyl diphosphatesynthase (GGPPSI), copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS1), and two cytochromes P450 (CYP76AH1 and CYP76AH3) were also more responsive to YE in S. castanea than those in S. miltiorrhiza. Accumulations of dihydrotanshinone I and tanshinone I, and most bio-synthetic genes in S. miltiorrhiza were more responsive to Ag+ than those in S. castanea. Accumulations of dihydrotanshinone I and cryptotanshinone were more responsive to YE, while tanshinone IIA accumulation was more responsive to Ag+ in S. miltiorrhiza. However, accumulations of other four tanshinones and related. genes in S. castanea were more responsive to YE than Ag. This study provides foundations for studying diverse specialized metabolism between the related species.

AB Every part of the sika deer (Cervus nippon) body is valuable traditional Chinese medicine. And sika deer is the most important semi-domestic medicinal animal that is widely bred in Jilin province northeast of China. But few studies had been conducted to characterize the microsatellite markers derived from sika deer. We firstly used IlluminaHiSeq (TM) 2500 sequencing technology obtained 125 Mbp genomic data of sika deer. Using microsatellite identification tool (MISA), 22,479 microsatellites were identified. From these data, 100 potential primers were selected for further polymorphic validation, finally, 76 primer pairs were successfully amplified and 29 primer pairs were found to be obvious polymorphic in 8 different individuals. Using those polymorphic microsatellite markers, we analyzed the genetic diversity of Jilin sika deer population. The mean number of alleles of the 29 loci is 9.31 based on genotyping blood DNA from 96 Jilin sika deer; The mean expected heterozygosity and polymorphic information content (PIC) value of the 29 loci is 0.72 and 0.68 respectively, and among which 26 loci are highly polymorphic (PIC > 0.50). According to the electrophoretic results and PIC value of these 29 loci, 10 loci with combined paternity exclusion probabilities > 99.99% were selected to use in parentage verification for 16 sika deer. All the offspring of a family could be successfully assigned to their biological father. These microsatellite markers generated in this study could greatly facilitate future studies of molecular breeding in sika deer.

AB Purpose: This study aimed to identify genes with significant alteration following treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).
   Methods: We downloaded microarray data of GSE67051 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Genes with differential expression were identified in two groups: erlotinib-treated versus DMSO-treated PC9 cells and erlotinib-treated versus DMSO-treated HCC827 cells. Functional enrichment analysis and protein protein interaction (PPI) network were performed on the overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Additionally, miRNAs that can regulate the DEGs were predicted. Small-molecule drugs, with possible synergistic or antagonistic actions with respect to erlotinib, were screened; data validation using another dataset was conducted.
   Results: In total, 1466 and 839 DEGs were identified in the aforementioned comparison groups, respectively, among which 267 overlapping up-regulated and 73 down-regulated were observed. The overlapping up- and down-regulated genes were significantly associated with different functions and pathways. ITGA2 had higher centrality scores in the PPI network. Seventy small-molecule drugs, with either possible synergistic or antagonistic roles with erlotinib, were identified. Moreover, up-regulated YPEL1, YPEL2, and YPEL5 were enriched in the miRNA-target regulatory network. Implementing data validation, we found YPEL1, YPEL5, and ITGA2 displayed similar expression profiles in the two datasets.
   Conclusion: YPEL1 and YPEL5 may be related to the action of erlotinib, and down-regulation of ITGA2 may be associated with the development of acquired resistance to erlotinib in EGFR-mutant NSCLCs. Furthermore, several small-molecule drugs that may have synergistic and antagonistic roles with erlotinib were identified.

AB Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division necessary for sexual reproduction in eukaryotes. A better understanding of the cytological procedures of meiosis has been achieved by comprehensive cytogenetic studies in plants, while the genetic mechanisms regulating meiotic progression remain incompletely understood. The increasing accumulation of complete genome sequences and large-scale gene expression datasets has provided a powerful resource for phylogenomic inference and unsupervised identification of genes involved in plant meiosis. By integrating sequence homology and expression data, 164, 131, 124 and 162 genes potentially important for meiosis were identified in the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana, Otyza sativa, Selaginella moellendorffii and Pogonatum aloides, respectively. The predicted genes were assigned to 45 meiotic GO terms, and their functions were related to different processes occurring during meiosis in various organisms. Most of the predicted meiotic genes underwent lineage-specific duplication events during plant evolution, with about 30% of the predicted genes retaining only a single copy in higher plant genomes. The results of this study provided clues to design experiments for better functional characterization of meiotic genes in plants, promoting the phylogenomic approach to the evolutionary dynamics of the plant meiotic machineries.

AB Haemophilus parasuis is an opportunistic pathogen and the causative agent of Glasser's disease in swine. This disease has high morbidity and mortality rates in swine populations, and is responsible for major economic losses worldwide. Survival of H. parasuis within the host requires mechanisms for coping with oxidative stress conditions. In many bacteria, OxyR is known to mediate protection against oxidative stress; however, little is known about the role of OxyR in H. parasuis. In the current study, an oxyR mutant strain was constructed in H. parasuis strain SC1401 and designated H. parasuis SC1401 Delta oxyR. The oxyR mutant strain had a slower growth rate and impaired biofilm formation compared to the wild type strain. Complementation restored the growth-associated phenotypes to wild type levels. Oxidative stress susceptibility testing, using a range of concentrations of H2O2, indicated that H. parasuis SC1401 Delta oxyR was more sensitive to oxidative stress than the wild type strain. RNA sequencing transcriptome analysis comparing H. parasuis SC1401 with H. parasuis SC1401 Delta oxyR identified 466 differentially expressed genes. These genes were involved in a wide range of biological processes, including: oxidative stress, transcriptional regulation, and DNA replication, recombination, and repair. These findings provide a foundation for future research to examine the role of OxyR as a global transcriptional regulator and to better define its role in oxidative stress resistance in H. parasuis.

AB The Npcl(nmf164) allele of Npc1 provides a mouse model for Niemann-Pick disease type Cl (NPC1), a genetic disease known to have a widely variable phenotype. The transfer of the Npc1(nmf164) mutation from the C57BL/6J inbred strain to the BALB/cJ inbred strain increased the mean lifespan from 117.8 days to 153.1 days, confirming that the severity of the NPC1 phenotype is strongly influenced by genetic background. The transfer of another Npc1 allele, Npc1(nth), to this background also extended survival of the homozygotes indicating that the modifying effect of BALB/cJ is not limited to a single allele of Npc1. The increased longevity due to the BALB/cJ background did not map to a previously mapped modifier on chromosome 19, indicating the presence of additional genes impacting disease severity. The previously studied Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein promoter-Npc1 cDNA transgene (GFAP-Npc1) which only expresses NPC1 in astrocytes further extended the lifespan of Npc1(nmf164) homozygotes on a BALB/cJ background (up to 600 days). Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP beta CD) treatment, not previously tested in the Npc1(nmf164) mutant, extended life in the Npc1(nmf164) homozygotes but not the transgenic, Npc1(nmff164) mice on the BALB/cJ background. In all cases, lack of weight gain and early cerebellar symptoms of loss of motor control were found. At termination, the one mouse sacrificed for histological studies showed severe, diffuse pulmonary alveolar proteinosis suggesting that pulmonary abnormalities in NPC1 mouse models are not unique to the Npe1(nth) allele.

AB Advancement in genome sequencing and in silico mining tools have provided new opportunities for comparative primate genomics of microsatellites. The SSRs (simple sequence repeats) numbers were not correlated with the genome size (Pearson, r = 0.310, p = 0.550), and were positively correlated with the total length of SSRs (Pearson, r = 0.992, p = 0.00). A total of 224,289 tetranucleotide orthologous microsatellites families and 367 single-copy orthologous SSRs loci were found in six primate species by homologous alignment. The inner mutation types of single-copy orthologous SSRs loci included the copy number variance, point mutation, and chromosomal translocation. The accumulated repeat times and average length of tetranucleotide orthologous microsatellites in Rhinopithecus roxellana, Papio anubis and Macaca mulatta were longer than Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes, which showed the tetranucleotide orthologous SSRs loci had more repeat times and longer average length on the branches with earlier divergence time, one exception may be Microcebus murinus as a primitive monkey with a smallest morphology in Malagasy. Our conclusion indicated that single-copy tetra nucleotide orthologous SSRs sequences accumulated individual mutation more slowly through time in H. sapiens and P. troglodytes than in R. roxellanae, P. anubis and M. mulatta. However, such divergence wouldn't arise uniformly in all branches of the primate tree. A comparison of genomic sequence assemblages would offer remarkable insights about comparisons and contrasts, and the evolutionary processes of the microsatellites involved in human and nonhuman primate species.

AB The PURA gene encodes Pur-alpha, a 322 amino acid protein with repeated nucleic acid binding domains that are highly conserved from bacteria through humans. PUR genes with a single copy of this domain have been detected so far in spirochetes and bacteroides. Lower eukaryotes possess one copy of the PUR gene, whereas chordates possess 1 to 4 PUR family members. Human PUR genes encode Pur-alpha (Pura), Pur-beta (Purb) and two forms of Pur-gamma (Purg). Pur-alpha is a protein that binds specific DNA and RNA sequence elements. Human PURA, located at chromosome band 5q31, is under complex control of three promoters. The entire protein coding sequence of PURA is contiguous within a single exon. Several studies have found that over expression or microinjection of Pura inhibits anchorage-independent growth of oncogenically transformed cells and blocks proliferation at either G1-S or G2-M checkpoints. Effects on the cell cycle may be mediated by interaction of Pura with cellular proteins including Cyclin/Cdk complexes and the Rb tumor suppressor protein. PURA knockout mice die shortly after birth with effects on brain and hematopoietic development. In humans environmentally induced heterozygous deletions of PURA have been implicated in forms of myelodysplastic syndrome and progression to acute myelogenous leukemia. Pura plays a role in AIDS through association with the HIV-1 protein, Tat. In the brain Tat and Pura association in glial cells activates transcription and replication of JC polyomavirus, the agent causing the demyelination disease, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Tat and Pura also act to stimulate replication of the HIV-1 RNA genome. In neurons Pura accompanies mRNA transcripts to sites of translation in dendrites. Microdeletions in the PURA locus have been implicated in several neurological disorders. De novo PURA mutations have been related to a spectrum of phenotypes indicating a potential PURA syndrome. The nucleic acid, G-rich Pura binding element is amplified as expanded poly nucleotide repeats in several brain diseases including fragile X syndrome and a familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/fronto-temporal dementia. Throughout evolution the Pura protein plays a critical role in survival, based on conservation of its nucleic acid binding properties. These Pura properties have been adapted in higher organisms to the as yet unfathomable development of the human brain.

AB Single-phase aluminum nitride (AlN) films were synthesized on Si substrates by RF sputtering at different working pressures and different annealing temperatures. Effect of two factors on crystal quality, surface roughness and molecular structure was investigated. As the working pressure rose, the crystal quality of AlN films first increased and then decreased, reaching the best quality at the pressure of 0.7 Pa in the range of 0.3-2.5 Pa. When the annealing temperature was 100 degrees C, root-mean-square surface roughness was greatly reduced from 1.510 nm to 0.554 nm. In addition annealing technology could evidently enhance Al-N covalent bond density. In short, this work provides an effective approach to fabricate high-quality AlN (1 0 0) films for future applications of AlN-based devices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

MoO3: Er3+/ Yb3+ microplates were composed of a preferred orientation orthorhombic phase with the jellyfish-like morphology of three distinct crystallization zones. A possible growth mechanism such as casted ingot was proposed and the effects of synthesis parameters on microplate morphology were discussed. In addition, the photoluminescence spectrum indicates a strong and pure green upconversion emission under infrared laser excitation. The results demonstrate that evaporation is an effective method to synthesize rare-earth doped MoO3 upconversion materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB The pseudo-Hall effect in n-type single crystal 3C-SiC(100) with low carrier concentration has been investigated. Low pressure chemical vapor deposition was used to grow the single crystal n-type 3C-SiC(100) and Hall devices were fabricated by photolithography and dry etch processes. A large pseudo-Hall effect was observed in the grown thin films which showed a strong dependence on the crys-tallographic orientation. N-type 3C-SiC(100) with low carrier concentration shows a completely different behavior of pseudo-Hall measurements as compared to the p-type 3C-SiC(100). Contrary to p-type, the effect is maximum along [100] crystallographic orientation and minimum along [110] orientation. Moreover, the observed pseudo-Hall effect is 50% larger than p-type with higher carrier concentration grown by the same process which makes n-type 3C-SiC(100) with low carrier concentration more suitable material for designing highly sensitive micro-mechanical sensors.

AB Electrocatalytic production of hydrogen through non-precious metals is of great importance. While Ni and its alloys show a good catalytic activity in alkaline solutions, their poor response and stability in acidic electrolytes is yet a challenge. Herein, we report on the electrodeposition of Ni-W nanoparticles (NPs) with the aim of electrocatalytic enhancement of nickel material in acidic media for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The catalyst showed a high current density of 10 mA. cm(-2) at -205 mV (vs. RHE) for HER and an improved stability compared to that of tungsten-free Ni NPs. The high catalytic activity of Ni-W NPs stems from incorporation of the tungsten atoms into the nickel structure. The results are promising for developing of highly efficient, earth-abundant and inexpensive Ni-based cathodes for HER. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of bismuth (Bi) doping on the properties of Cu(In, Al)Se-2 thin films by pre-depositing a thin layer of bismuth has been investigated systematically via the sputtering approach followed by a selenization treatment. It is demonstrated that the crystallinity of CIAS thin films has been affected by various content of Bi doping with no impurity phases presented by XRD patterns and Raman spectra. Moreover, the grain size in the obtained films has been significantly increased by the incorporation of Bi with less grain boundaries, which can be attributed to the low melting point of Bi, a fluxing agent during the grain growth process. In addition, all the thin films with various content of Bi doping have estimated band gaps around 0.95 eV, revealing that Bi doping has a faint effect on the optical properties in CIAS structure.

   nanowires

ID POLYOL SYNTHESIS; TRANSPARENT; NUCLEANT; GROWTH
AB The bromide-mediated polyol method has been widely used to synthesize ultrathin silver nanowires, however, the reason why the addition of bromide ions can reduce the diameter of silver nanowires is unclear. To elucidate this mechanism, we have conducted a series of experiments in which the amount of halide ions is kept constant while the ratio of Cl to Br ions is varied, to investigate how the halide ions influence the morphology of AgNWs. Based on these experiments and previous studies, we propose herein that the bromide ions fulfill three roles: (i) facilitating the formation of AgBr cubes as nucleation events, (ii) limiting the lateral growth of AgNWs and (iii) enabling the formation of more stable AgBr complexes. Our current study should be useful for enabling size-controlled synthesis of silver nanowires via the bromide-mediated polyol method. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The prepared CNTS thin films were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and impedance spectroscopy. The result obtained from the XRD measurements showed that CNTS thin films are polycrystalline in nature with cubic structure and preferred orientation along (111) plane. Electrical study of CNTS thin films is investigated by impedance spectroscopy for the first time. The activation energies E-a obtained from both angular frequency and DC conductivity are found to be 1.18 and 1.1 eV, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, zinc hydroxystannate (ZHS) was microencapsulated by aluminium phosphate (AlP) to prepare AlP/ZHS microcapsule, it was introduced into polylactic acid (PLA). The flammability of the PLA was characterized by limiting oxygen index (LOI), vertical burning (UL-94), smoke density (SDR) and cone calorimeter test. The results showed that PLA containing 15 wt% AlP/ZHS microcapsule achieved the LOI value of 32.5%, passed the UL-94 V-0 rating, and significantly decreased the peak heat release rate, which imply that the fire safety of PLA has been improved. Meanwhile, the SDR value reached 44%. Thus, AlP/ZHS microcapsule can effectively enhance flame retardancy and smoke suppression, showing potential applications as multifunctional advanced composites.

AB The development of environment-friendly, high-performance, and low-cost photoelectrocatalysts is hindered by the low separation efficiency of electron-hole pairs, corrosion from light illumination, and harsh environments. In this study, we propose a hierarchical structured nanocomposite that addresses all the aforementioned problems. Our design is inspired by the structure of a dragon fruit, in which CuInS2/CdS quantum dots (QDs) are encapsulated with TiO2 nanofilms. CuInS2/CdS QDs possess effective charge separation capability but suffer from photocorrosion, whereas TiO2 exhibits the opposite behavior. As a result of this hierarchical arrangement, the complementary system exhibits outstanding durability (lasting longer than 240 h without decay) and high-performance photoelectrocatalysis activity (potentials of approximately -0.219 V to obtain current densities of 100 mA cm(-2)) under light illumination.

AB The effect of size on the torsional deformation of [1 1 0]-oriented silicon nanowires is examined via molecular dynamics simulations. The plastic deformation mechanism of silicon nanowires depends on the nanowire diameter. Sub-5.7-nm-diameter silicon nanowires yield by means of a crystal-to-amorphous transition, which nucleates at the outer surface and propagates along the cross-section of the wires. On the other hand, perfect dislocations nucleate at the outer surface of wires whose diameter equals or exceeds 7.7 nm, initiating plastic deformation. These dislocations have a Burgers vector of 1/2 < 110 > and slip along the {1 1 1} planes. These findings may enhance our understanding of plasticity of silicon nanowires. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Wettability patterns were fabricated on a surface based on titanium dioxide (TiO2) by etching of a Ti substrate with sulfuric acid and coating with TiO2 nanoparticles. Images obtained using a field emission scanning electron microscope and three-dimensional laser microscope reveal that the etched surface was covered with TiO2 nanoparticles and the surface roughness of TiO2-coated sample was lower value (2.51 mm) that of sample coated without TiO2 (3.19 mm), indicating that the surface roughness was decreased by coating with TiO2 nanoparticles. It was also confirmed that the crystal structure of TiO2-coated sample was rutile and anatase. The TiO2-coated sample modified with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) showed a superhydrophobic property. The surface of the TiO2-coated sample gradually transformed into a superhydrophilic surface under UV irradiation because of the photocatalytic decomposition of the SAMs, and the decrease in the contact angle on the TiO2-coated sample was faster than that on the sample without TiO2 coating. In addition, the TiO2-coated sample produced renewable wettability patterns for blood, which demonstrate the great potential of this material in biomedical applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The work investigated the effect of deformation path on texture and tension properties of submicrocrystalline Al-Mg-Si alloy sample processed by differential speed rolling (DSR). DSR was performed on the present samples rotated between passage utilizing three paths, such as no rotation, rotations along the transverse and rolling axes toward deformation direction in order to understand the roles of the different characteristics of macro-shear. When both no rotation and rotation along the transverse axis were applied, high strength but low ductility would be obtained due to the presence of fine grains together with lamellar bands. A good combination of strength (similar to 312 MPa) and ductility (similar to 7.4%) was attained by means of rotation along the rolling axis, giving rise to the conjugation of macro-shear bands. This was explained in relation to the interpretation of recrystallization texture components. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB High level of mixed-conductivity and good stability of oxide La0.5Sr0.5FeO3-delta make it promising for the development of functional materials for such energy-related applications as solid oxide fuel cells and membrane reactors for partial oxidation of methane. The oxygen content in La0.49Sr0.5-xBaxFeO3-delta (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5) was measured by means of coulometric titration in the interval of partial oxygen pressure between 10(-20) and 0.5 atm at temperatures 750-950 degrees C. The obtained results were employed for defect structure analysis of oxides. An ideal solution model enabled satisfactory simulation of experimental data for barium-free oxide. A reasonable data description for barium-containing oxides was achieved in the model, assuming that some of the oxygen vacancies are unavailable for oxygen ions. Partial substitution of barium for strontium was found to decrease the oxidation reaction constant of iron ions, resulting in a raised concentration of n-type electronic charge carriers and a reduced concentration of p-type carriers.

AB Ga3+-diffused lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) strip optical waveguide was fabricated by diffusion (at 950 degrees C for 1.5 h) of 8-mu m wide, 112-nm thick Ga2O3-strips photolithographically patterned onto a Z-cut congruent LiTaO3 substrate. Crystalline phase, composition, optical properties and profile characteristics of Ga3+ ions in the waveguide were investigated. We show that the waveguide retains LiTaO3 crystalline phase and is in congruent composition environment. Optical studies show that the waveguide supports single-mode propagation (at the 1.5 mu m wavelength) of not only the extraordinary wave but also the ordinary wave, shows considerable polarization dependence in mode field distribution, and has a loss of 0.2/0.4 dB/cm for the ordinary/extraordinary wave. Secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis shows that the Ga3+ profile follows a sum of two error functions (a Gaussian function) in the width (depth) direction of the waveguide. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) possesses a set of characteristics superior for biomedical applications including bone-like stiffness and suitable biocompatibility. However, the clinical adoption of PEEK as orthopedic and dental implants is severely hampered by its bioinert surface property. The present work aimed at tailoring the PEEK surface with -COOH, -OH and -PO4H2 functional groups for the enhancement of osteogenic activity. In vitro cell adhesion and viability analyses have clearly disclosed that enhanced adhesion, spreading and proliferation of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast on these functional groups modified PEEK surfaces. In vivo evaluation of the rat femur model by means of push-out tests and histological analysis after 4 and 12 weeks confirms improved osteointegration and bone-implant bonding strength. Preliminary results imply that an implant material tailored by -COOH, -OH or -PO4H2 functional groups on its surface has certain bioactivity. And the results may provide insight into the design of biomaterials with chemical functional groups for bone regeneration. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The photocatalytic activities of the BiOI nanoplates were evaluated through the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) under xenon visible-light irradiation. Obviously, the pH of precursor solutions played an important role in the photocatalytic activities.

AB Solid wastes coal gangue and magnesium slag were added to prepare low density ceramic proppants at sintering temperatures below 1300 degrees C. The addition of solid wastes greatly decreases sintering temperature and preparation cost. The morphology and phase composition of the proppants were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results show that the main crystal phases of the proppants are granular corundum and rod-like mullite, and the proppants have better sphericity. Furthermore, the most suitable sintering temperature is 1250 degrees C, and the resulting ceramics exhibit transgranular fracture. This means that rod-like mullite crystals provide strong toughening and reinforcing effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel and flexible Mn3O4 nanosheets/reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (Mn3O4 NSs/rGO NSs) paper-like electrodes have been developed by a feasible method. The rGO works as a flexible substrate and an electron conductor. The synergetic effect of interconnected nanosheet structure can effectively depress self-agglomeration of rGO, which displays eminent conductivity. Moreover, the crumpled surface with more active sites are more convenient for the ion and electron insertion/desertion in the reversible reactions. So flexible Mn3O4 NSs/rGO NSs electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 409 F g (1) at a current density of 0.5 A g (1), superior cycling stability of 92% after 3000 charge-discharge cycles. More importantly, the composite material was first applied in 3D printing and screen printing of micro-patterns because of the desirable processability. It is anticipated that the high-performance Mn3O4 NSs/rGO NSs composites are a promising electrode material in printable energy storage and wearable electronic equipment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Free-standing carbon (FSC) films were prepared by stabilization and carbonization of graphene oxide (GO)/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) blending films. These films incorporated with reduced GO (r-GO) exhibited much better flexibility than that of the pure carbon film. The morphologies showed that the intermediate layers formed with larger and denser graphite plane structure were induced by GO template and ordered along the r-GO sheets. It was believed that the induced graphitic structure, the preferred orientation of r-GO sheets, and the defects in FSC films help to improve the flexibility of FSC films. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Direct photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting using solar energy offers a potential pathway to produce a clean, renewable, and sustainable source of hydrogen fuel. Herein, the TiO2/graphene nanocomposite for PEC water splitting was prepared by a combination of the drop-cast deposition of graphene nanosheets and the sputtering deposition of TiO2 films. The surface morphology, crystalline phase, and optical properties were investigated by Scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. The results showed that the thermal treatment process and the combination with graphene nanosheets could effectively enhance PEC water oxidation of TiO2 photocatalyst. This enhancement could attribute to efficient charge transfer from TiO2 to graphene and the porous graphene framework. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB La doped Bi5Ti3FeO15 (BTFO) multiferroic films with various doping concentration were synthesized by chemical solution deposition method. The structure, ferroelectric, magnetic properties, and magnetoelectric coupling effect were systemically investigated. Room temperature magnetoelectric effect was obtained. And the magnetoelectric coupling and magnetic exchange bias effects are regulated by the doping concentration of La. Such regulation originates from the evolution of magnetic structure derived from doping rare earth La. The coexistence of ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders can be controlled by the doping concentration of La. Thus, the superexchange interaction between FM and AFM orders was enhanced strongly, which contributes to the strong magnetoelectric coupling effect. This work provides an avenue on regulating the magnetic structure and magnetoelectric coupling effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We fabricated high-quality epitaxial Ca0.8La0.2IrO3 (CLIO) films on SrTiO3 (STO), (LaAlO3)(0.3)(Sr2AlTaO6)(0.7) (LSAT) and NdGaO3 (NGO) substrates by pulsed laser deposition, and systematically studied their transport properties. All samples showed insulating behavior, but the resistivity of CLIO/NGO film showed relatively weak temperature dependence and can be regarded as a poor metallic behavior. The carrier transport in all the samples were dominated by the Mott-type variable range hopping. The magnetoresistance of CLIO/NGO showed a value about 6%, larger than that of CLIO/STO and CLIO/LSAT, while the CLIO/STO sample showed very large magnetic moment and small coercive field. These findings indicate that mechanical strain can be a useful route to explore the unusual physics of iridates with strong spinorbit coupling. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon can play a decisive role in the preparation of the titanium dioxide modification anatase. Amorphous titanium containing diamond-like carbon films are a suitable basis for this process. Those films can be deposited by a process that combines reactive magnetron sputtering with plasma source ion implantation, using a mixture of argon and ethylene (C2H4) for the plasma. After film deposition, annealing of the samples for 1 h at a fixed temperature between 723 K and 873 K in ambient atmosphere led to oxidation and crystallization. Colorless pure anatase was observed after annealing. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The smart structure design can not only effectively enhance electrical conductivity of composite electrode, but also relax the volume change of MoS2 upon electrochemical cycling. Due to the structural and compositional advantages, the present sample exhibits excellent anode performance with large and stable lithium storage, as well as high rate capability.

AB The effect of hydrogen content on room temperature compressive properties of Ti44Al6Nb (at.%) alloy was studied. The results show that hydrogen promotes a solid solution strengthening in TiAl alloys, the microhardness increases with increasing of hydrogen content, which is increased by 40% after hydrogenation with 1.22 at.% H. As hydrogen content increases, the ultimate compressive strength and fracture strain increases firstly and then decreases. The Ti44Al6Nb alloy exhibits higher compressive strength and plasticity after addition of 0.42 at.% H, which is enhanced by 10% and 31% respectively. The distinct effect of hydrogen on the mechanical properties of TiAl alloys is attributed to the hydrogen-promoted dislocation motion and hydrogen-induced solution strengthening.

AB Due to the crystal anisotropy, highly oriented films normally exhibit unique properties and performances. In this paper, Ag films were deposited using arc ion plating (AIP) at different substrate temperatures, substrate bias voltages and Ar pressures, and the relationship between the preferred orientation and deposition parameter of the films was investigated. The results exhibited that the preferred orientation of Ag films was influenced significantly by the deposition parameter due to the competition between the surface-and strain-energy minimization, and so both Ag films that exhibited highly preferred orientations of (1 1 1) and (2 0 0), respectively, were obtained at the optimum conditions. The relatively low friction was observed from the Ag film with highly preferred orientations of (1 1 1) because the (1 1 1) plane was the slip plane of face-centred cubic crystals.

AB Ordering of surface particles by the moving grain boundary was detected in this study. This beautiful effect was revealed in the previously studied Cu[Co] system. The ordering involves lining up of particles to form chains oriented along the direction of grain boundary motion. The process takes place in the range of temperatures and compositions corresponding to the surface phase transition. The morphology of thermally etched grooves allows one to estimate the speed of grain boundary ordering the surface particles. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID TITANIUM-ALLOY
AB Control of microstructural formation in direct metal deposition (DMD) presents a significant current limitation to the technology. Researchers have attempted to overcome this by thermal management in the process and through the formulation of new alloys. A novel material preparation method "satelliting" was used in combination with DMD to improve the microstructure of the deposited alloys. Three feedstocks of Ti-15Mo, including a satellited feedstock, a blend of Ti/Mo (150 mu m) and blended Ti/Mo (3 mu m), were prepared and used for DMD of Ti-15Mo. Fine equiaxed grains and near-equiaxed grains distributed uniformly were found in the deposited sample from satellited feedstock, while the samples from blended Ti/Mo (150 mu m) and Ti/Mo (3 mu m) are dominated by larger near-equiaxed grains and epitaxial columnar grains, respectively. The effect of the nucleation was verified by combinatory analysis of unmelted Mo particles. This demonstrates a new route to the manufacture of components through DMD which produces applicable microstructures directly from the build. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present study, the surface morphology using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the optical properties by Raman Spectroscopy has been used to understand the modification in the 4H-SiC and 6H-SiC wafers due to the low energy He ion implantations. The AFM results show that the He implantation manifests swelling of the surface of the samples. It is also observed that the surface roughness of the 4H-SiC is approximately three times higher than the 6H-SiC after He implantation. The Raman spectra show enhancement in the second order optical modes which are stronger in the 4H-SiC and are complimentary to the observed surface roughness. This optical enhancement is also associated with the sp(2)/sp(3) hybridization of the carbon. The Raman spectra also indicate the presence of monoatomic lattice of Si atoms from the enhancement of the acoustic phonons. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Results showed that nanostructured surfaces exhibited significantly lower tendency to corrosion due to the protecting effect given by the well-adherent TiO2 nanotubular layer. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The one-dimensional core-shell structure as an electrode facilitated a rapid electron transport and provided a large number of active sites in the charge/discharge process. As a three-electrode system, the supercapacitor based on ZnCo2O4@Ni3S2/Ni foam exhibited a specific capacitance of 1725 F/g at a current density of 5 A/g, and maintained the cycling stability of 88.9% at a current density of 5 A/g after 1000 cycles.

AB The discovery of novel biodegradable biomaterials able to support and control cellular activity as well as development of an enhanced and efficient method for their fabrication, are of paramount importance in the field of tissue engineering. This study highlights the design of novel degradable hydrogels based on gelatin and hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylates using the innovative combined two-step sequential microwave-assisted and UV photo-polymerization technique. Chemical composition, morphology, swelling capacity and degradation rate of the synthesized hydrogels were evaluated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), swelling and weight loss measurements. As an initial step for evaluation of performance of the hydrogels in the biological environment, the in vitro biocompatibility of these hydrogels, was evaluated using L929 mouse fibroblasts. Obtained results demonstrated that the hydrogels possess a porous morphology with interconnected pores, 50% in vitro degradation after 7 months, and satisfied biocompatibility on L929 fibroblast cells. These unique performances of the hydrogels make them promising candidates for in vivo evaluation in clinical studies aiming at tissue regeneration. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Microstructure, composition, in vitro degradation and cytocompatibility of coating were examined systematically. The in vitro electrochemical tests revealed that the Hf/PLLA duplex coating has significantly suppressed the degradation of magnesium alloy with the low corrosion current density of 0.02 mu A/cm(2) and high corrosion resistance of 324.5 K Omega cm(2). Simultaneously, the cytocompatibility of magnesium alloy was further improved, as observed by the superior cell adhesion and proliferation of human osteoblast-like MG63 cells on the duplex coating.

ID OVERLAYS; CARBON; W2C; WC
AB Ni-based alloys reinforced with fused tungsten carbides (FTCs) become more and more important as hardfacing material in the mining and oil drilling industry. The reason for the high abrasive wear resistance of FTCs lies in the microstructure, characterized by an eutectoid morphology of mono-tungsten carbide (WC) and di-tungsten carbide (W2C). The benefit is a combination of high hardness and fracture toughness. However, FTCs are thermally instable and dissolute in case of high thermal loads during welding. An indicator for the dissolution of FTCs is the formation of a degradation seam along the interface to the surrounding Ni-based alloy. However, the formation mechanism of the degradation seam has not been fully understood and is diversely discussed. By means of an experimental approach, the formation of the degradation seam was reproduced experimentally and proven for the first time. The degradation is initiated by the selective dissolution of the phase W2C. Due to W and C dissolved in the melt, WC precipitates in the Ni-based alloy. Fused tungsten carbides act as nucleus and promote the precipitation of WC. The precipitation of WC leads to the formation of the typical degradation seam. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The amorphous-SnO2 (a-SnO2) thin films with different thickness were deposited on well-aligned single crystal SnO2 (c-SnO2) nanowire arrays by magnetron sputtering technology. The effects of the a-SnO2 on the morphology and field-emission (FE) properties of the c-SnO2 were investigated. The results show that the turn-on field of the nanowire increases with increasing a-SnO2 coating thickness. The c-SnO2 emitters with a-SnO2 sputtering at 10 s showed a lowest turn-on field of 0.95 V mu m(-1) at a current density of 10 mu A cm(-2) and a highest emission current density of 2.44 mA cm(-2) under the field of only 1.56 V mu m(-1). The enhanced FE property is due to the thin a-SnO2 film in situ formed nanoparticles on the nanowire back-bone, which could perform the role of tip in the surface of the nanowires and bring a significantly increased density of the electron emission sites.

AB Preparation of Cu2O microrods was designed by a rapid water-assisted template-free method under solvothermal condition at 150 degrees C/2 h using copper salt, di-methyl formamide and water. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) revealed the existence of Cu2O phase in the as-synthesized samples. Morphological features showed the microrod (18-33 mu m length) architecture of Cu2O in the presence of excess amount of water (15 mL). The role of water contents on the microstructural evolution and optical features of Cu2O microrods was demonstrated. A tentative formation mechanism for the evolution Cu2O microrods was proposed.

ID MATRIX COMPOSITES
AB Ag/graphite composites, as the most well-known sliding contact material, have short lifetime resulting from its lower hardness and strength. Ti3AlC2 has high conductivity, high hardness and layered structure similar to graphite, which makes it an ideal substitute for graphite. Here, Ag/Ti3AlC2 composites were successfully fabricated via hot pressing technique. In comparison with commercial Ag/graphite composites, the obtained Ag/5 vol% Ti3AlC2 composite exhibited superior mechanical and electrical properties, that is, high hardness of 94.5 +/- 0.3 Hv, high tensile strength of 220.0 MPa, and high conductivity of 59.5% IACS (the international annealed copper standard). The formation of Ag (Al) solid solution in interfacial zone, arising from the partial decomposition of Ti3AlC2, greatly enhanced the mechanical properties of Ag/Ti3AlC2 composites.

AB Simultaneous improvements in strength and corrosion resistance of Mg-Gd-Y-Zr alloy were realized through forging at room temperature with formation of ultrafine grained (UFG) structure. Compared with its coarse grained (CG) counterpart, the UFG sample exhibits an enhancement of 211 MPa (103%) in yield strength and a reduction of 0.644 x 10 (5) A/cm(2) (25%) in corrosion current density. Effect of microstructure on the mechanical property was quantitatively investigated, revealing a good coincidence of the experimental result with the calculated one based on Bailey-Hirsch equation. The improvement in corrosion resistance is attributed to the formation of sub-grain boundaries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using an aqueous extract of an agroindustrial residue of the tequila industry [i.e. leaves of Agave tequilana Weber var. azul (AT)], and silver nitrate or silver acetate as precursor salts is reported. The presence of AgNPs was confirmed by color change, scanning electron microscopy, ultraviolet visible spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. AgNPs were tested against clinically important bacteria. The effect of extract concentration and the reaction temperature was investigated. Results revealed that, the concentration of AgNPs increases as temperature and extract concentration increase. AgNPs were found to be mainly spherical shaped and showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Results demonstrate the possibility of using a natural extract obtained from an abundant agroindustrial residue for the sustainable synthesis of AgNPs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID DEPENDENCE; FIBERS
AB During tensile tests of carbon nanotube (CNT) macrostructures (ribbons, ropes and tows) under dynamic strain rates (1000 s(-1)), we recorded temporally sporadic, spatially localized visible light emissions ("flashes") of less than 1.5 mu s duration. The flashes occurred at the fracture sites and were, depending on the sample morphology, either distributed randomly over time (for tows) or occurred all at once over larger areas of several pixels (for ribbons). In situ thermal camera measurements, as well as ex situ analysis by electron microscopy reveal a hierarchical mechanism of overall heating over the whole sample length during straining, and localized heating around the fracture surfaces. Temperatures around the fracture tip were calculated to be of 1800 K in average. We propose that the flashes are caused by charge separation due to CNT bond fracture and gas discharge of the surrounding gases. Triboluminescence, known for larger sugar crystals, has not been observed for carbon nanotubes previously. It results from the yarn-like morphology, the ultra-high strength and thermal conductivity of our CNT fibers, which at high strain rates concentrate the strain at CNT level and lead to CNT fracture, rather than bundle sliding.

AB While using synchrotron X-ray radiography for studying ultrasonic melt processing, the growth of the primary Al2Cu intermetallic phase on fragments of aluminium oxide film during solidification of a hypereutectic Al-35% Cu alloy was observed in-situ and in real time with adequate spatial and temporal resolution. This provides the first direct evidence for the nucleation of a primary phase on oxide particles during solidification of real metallic alloys. Comparison of the primary Al2Cu intermetallics grown in the melt with and without fragments of aluminium oxide film reveals considerable refinement, which demonstrates that the enhanced nucleation of a primary phase on oxide particles promotes structure refinement.

SO MATERIALS LETTERS

DT Article
DE Nanocrystalline materials; Spectroscopy; Phase transformation;
   Electrical properties
AB High-pressure in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and electrical measurements were performed on InN hollow nanotubes to establish the correlation between structural changes and electrical transportation properties under compression. XRD spectra indicate a partially reversible wurtzite-rocksalt structural transition of InN induced by compression. Pressure-cycling resistivity and impedance spectra measurements reveal the corresponding electrical anomalies during the transition. Variable temperature resistivity indicates an unexpected metallic-like conduction of InN within 100-300 K in whole observed pressure range, which is attributed to the gradually enhanced phonon scattering at nano-grain boundaries and the almost unchanged electron concentration with temperature elevation. Pressure dependent temperature coefficient further evidences the wurtzite-rocksalt structural transition. Definite conductive phase diagram reported here will shed a new light on building InN-based application of the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Condensed microdrops self-jumping (CMSJ) surfaces with specific nanostructure have been actively explored to promote favorable droplet dynamics for enhancement of condensation heat transfer efficiency. However, the CMSJ surfaces based on the glass itself are insufficient in the past, although it is significant in daily life and industry processes. Here, we report condensed microdrops with size of 20-30 mu m could continuously self-jumping on the superhydrophobic glass slide with flake-like nanostructures and over 75% of dewdrops were maintained their diameter below 20 mu m after condensed 1000 s. This work is expected to provide unique advantages in condensation heat transfer for enlargement of application of glass in various fields. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB NO3-type Zn/Al layered double hydroxides were synthesized by co-precipitation method. The interlayers of the layered double hydroxides were highly expanded by intercalating laurate ions by ion exchange to get it easier to distinguish each layer of the layered double hydroxides by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observation. Direct observation of the stacking faults in the expanded LDH was successfully carried out by intercalating the laurate ions. The expanded LDH exhibited photoluminescence under the irradiation of 325 nm UV light. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Flake shaped particles of grain-oriented Fe80Ga20 and Fe73Ga27 alloys were prepared using a high-energy wet ball-milling process. The surface of flakes produced were predominantly parallel to the (1 0 0) crystallographic plane in flakes. These flakes possess two in-plane < 1 0 0 > easy axes of magnetization, which enhances magnetostrictive performance and sensitivity for use in composite materials. The deformation mechanism leading to formation of (1 0 0) grain-oriented flakes is associated with small angel crystal reorientations along slip lines similar to what occurs during rolling. Data are presented on the in-plane magnetic properties of these flakes, which were characterized using field-dependent magnetization measurements. The epoxy-bonded composites with the particle alignment exhibited high magnetostriction values of similar to 103 ppm. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Magnetic domain structures of CoFe2O4 nanodisks were investigated by magnetic force microscopy (MFM). A CoFe2O4 thin film was deposited on a Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si substrate using a spin coating process. Locally crystallized CoFe2O4 nanodisks were formed by local annealing with a heated atomic force microscopy tip at a fixed temperature of 700 degrees C. By controlling the local heating time, the diameters of the CoFe2O4 nanodisks with ferromagnetic domains were systematically adjusted over the range from 150 to 300 nm. MFM observations showed that the 150 nm CoFe2O4 nanodisks had magnetic domains with a vortex shape along the in-plane direction, with the magnetic spin oriented along the out-of-plane direction at the center of the nanodisk.

AB In this paper, a new kind of high infrared emissivity material, amorphous aluminum phosphate (AlPO4) was fabricated by polyesterification reaction between P2O5 and Al(NO3)(3)center dot 9H(2)O in ethyl alcohol (EtOH) solvent, followed by being calcined at certain temperatures. And the influence of calcination temperatures on crystallization behavior, solid Al-27 and P-31 chemical shift changes and infrared radiation performance were studied. DSC-TG curves demonstrate that no significant crystallization and crystal transformation occurred below 900 degrees C. XRD patterns and Al-27 and P-31 NMR spectra reveal P and Al chemical coordination transformation from octahedral to tetrahedral, these characterizations all prove that AlPO4 in amorphous state possesses higher emissivity than that of crystalline AlPO4. Amorphous AlPO4 with the highest infrared emissivity of 0.913 was prepared at 900 degrees C. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Lithium-sulfur battery has become to be one of the most promising electrochemical energy storage systems on account of the high theoretical specific capacity (1673 mAh/g) and high energy density (2600 Wh/kg). However, the relatively complicated producing process of the host materials and lithium-sulfur battery' cycling instability still hinder the commercialization of Li-S battery. Herein, a facile, inexpensive and scalable thermal treatment method was designed to synthesize the host material porous g-C3N4 composed by graphite-like two-dimensional rippled sheets and high content of pyridine N, improving the properties of Li-S batteries. Because of the high charge polarity and peculiar porous structure, the porous g-C3N4/S cathode delivered high initial discharge capacity of 1050 mAh/g. Furthermore, it possesses excellent cycling stability for 200 cycles with a low capacity fading rate of 0.2% per cycle at 0.1C and a high-rate capacity of similar to 400 mAh/g even at 1C rate. Therefore, this study presents a new enlightenment for researchers to realize the practical application of Li-S batteries and an effective reference for the design of other porous materials.

AB The phase change behavior of pure ZnTe and pseudo-binary ZnTe-ZnSb material has been investigated systemically in terms of the electrical, thermal and optical properties. The results show that ZnTe is a composition with fast continuous crystallization, wide optical band gap and large crystalline resistance but thermally unstable and poor phase-switching ability. The pseudo-binary ZnTe-ZnSb material inherits the characteristics of fast crystallization and wide optical band gap from ZnTe and good thermal stability from ZnSb, respectively, and even shows better phase change properties with higher crystallization temperature and larger crystalline resistance. From these results, we conclude that ZnTe-ZnSb can be one of the most promising materials for phase change memory application. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB MoS2 microflowers with the size of 3.9-5.8 mu m in diameter, which is constructed by nanosheets, are hydrothermally synthesized using sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihydrate as the sulfur source. Studies on the hydrothermal process reveal that the temperature plays crucial roles in determining the crystal phase of MoS2. It is found that the higher temperature favors the reduction of Mo (VI) to Mo (IV). The obtained MoS2 microflowers are highly active and selective for hydrogenation of nitrobenzene into aniline. Compared with commercial MoS2, the higher percentage of coordinative unsaturated Mo sites on MoS2 microflowers offer a relatively higher catalytic activity. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Silicon oxynitride (SiON) and SiO2 thin films attracted considerable attention for various applications such as anti-reflection coatings and surface passivation layers. In this report, we present the enhancement of sapphire optical transmittance by over-layer deposition of the amorphous SiON by RF magnetron sputtering, and investigation on changes in microstructure and transmittance upon high-temperature annealing similar to 1373 K. A thin layer of nanocrystalline SiO2 was formed at the sapphire/film interface induced by the annealing. Remarkably, the XPS spectra revealed that the silicon-nitrogen bonds disappear in the annealed films to form a non-stoichiometric silicon oxide (SiOx) phase. The films showed high visible transmittance similar to 92%, which is comparable to that of soda-lime glass due to a significant reduction in the refractive index 1.41 of the films after annealing at 1373 K.

AB Green emitting iron-oxide@NaGdF4:RE3+ (RE = 5%Ce, 5%Tb, 5%Dy) nanoparticles have been synthesized using microwave assisted solvothermal method. The Rietveld analysis of powder X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy provides an average crystallite size (similar to 20 nm) and the hexagonal crystal structure. Magnetic hysteresis loops at 300 K display superparamagnetic behavior along with paramagnetic feature for the reference NaGdF4:RE3+, further validated through magnetization versus temperature curves taken in an external magnetic field of 100 Oe. The photoluminescence investigation of the nanoparticles, suggest a down-converting energy transfer. The excitation spectra consist of a dominant broad band at around 254 nm due to Ce3+(4f-5d) along with f-f transitions due to Gd3+, Tb3+ and Dy3+ ions. The strong emission color lines due to characteristic transitions of Tb3+ (D-5(4) -> F-7(J), J = 6-3), and Dy3+ (F-4(9/2)-H-6(15/2), H-6(13/2)), were observed. The luminescence quenching in iron-oxide/NaGdF4: RE3+ through leakage path provided by iron-oxide to excite electrons has been confirmed and explained by comparing the time decay analysis.

AB Tungsten (W) as one of the potential plasma-facing materials (PFMS) in the nuclear fusion reactors would suffer severe irradiation which can result in deterioration of properties. Understanding the irradiation effects on PFMS is thus critical to improve their performances. Here, the He irradiation effects is studied by focusing on microstructures of the Wsurfaces. As the irradiation fluence increases, surface morphologies of W become rough with abundant nano-structures, namely nanotendrils. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images show these nanotendrils contain lots of He voids, which reveals good deformation behavior albeit brittle. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dual pore network polymer foams are categorized as foams having two interconnected pore networks of varying sizes. Potential applications of these foams are in the biomedical field for artificial organ development and high throughput drug testing. In this study, a cost effective and scalable processing technique for fabrication of dual pore network polymer foams via solid state foaming of additively manufactured templates is presented. Initially, a polymer template with either circular or hexagonal features is additively manufactured with the spacing between the features forming the first porous network. The second porous network is obtained by subjecting the additively manufactured template to solid state foaming. The resulting foams have porosity in excess of 80% with the pore sizes in the larger and smaller pore network on the order of 200 mm and 50 mm respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Is it possible to recover the position of a source from the steady-state fluxes of Brownian particles to small absorbing windows located on the boundary of a domain? To address this question, we develop a numerical procedure to avoid tracking Brownian trajectories in the entire infinite space. Instead, we generate particles near the absorbing windows, computed from the analytical expression of the exit probability. When the Brownian particles are generated by a steady-state gradient at a single point, we compute asymptotically the fluxes to small absorbing holes distributed on the boundary of half-space and on a disk in two dimensions, which agree with stochastic simulations. We also derive an expression for the splitting probability between small windows using the matched asymptotic method. Finally, when there are more than two small absorbing windows, we show how to reconstruct the position of the source from the diffusion fluxes. The present approach provides a computational first principle for the mechanism of sensing a gradient of diffusing particles, a ubiquitous problem in cell biology. (c) 2017 The Author(s).

AB We revisit the concept of an approximate delta function (ADF), introduced by Huynh (2011)[1], in the form of a finite-order polynomial that holds identical integral properties to the Dirac delta function when used in conjunction with a finite-order polynomial integrand over a finite domain. We show that the use of generic ADF polynomials can be effective at recovering and generalizing several high-order methods, including Taylor-based and nodal-based Discontinuous Galerkin methods, as well as the Correction Procedure via Reconstruction. Based on the ADF concept, we then proceed to formulate a Point-value enhanced Finite Volume (PFV) method, which stores and updates the cell-averaged values inside each element as well as the unknown quantities and, if needed, their derivatives on nodal points. The sharing of nodal information with surrounding elements saves the number of degrees of freedom compared to other compact methods at the same order. To ensure conservation, cell-averaged values are updated using an identical approach to that adopted in the finite volume method. Here, the updating of nodal values and their derivatives is achieved through an ADF concept that leverages all of the elements within the domain of integration that share the same nodal point. The resulting scheme is shown to be very stable at successively increasing orders. Both accuracy and stability of the PFV method are verified using a Fourier analysis and through applications to the linear wave and nonlinear Burgers' equations in one-dimensional space.

The solution and its normal derivative can undergo significant variations through these internal boundaries. We present a compact finite-difference scheme on a tree-based adaptive grid that can be efficiently solved using a natively parallel data structure.

AB The aim of this paper is to create a molecular algorithm for modeling the transport processes in gases that will be more efficient than molecular dynamics method. To this end, the dynamics of molecules are modeled stochastically. In a rarefied gas, it is sufficient to consider the evolution of molecules only in the velocity space, whereas for a dense gas it is necessary to model the dynamics of molecules also in the physical space. Adequate integral characteristics of the studied system are obtained by averaging over a sufficiently large number of independent phase trajectories. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm was demonstrated by modeling the coefficients of self-diffusion and the viscosity of several gases. It was shown that the accuracy comparable to the experimental one can be obtained on a relatively small number of molecules. The modeling accuracy increases with the growth of used number of molecules and phase trajectories. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We develop a finite-element based level set method for numerically solve shape optimization problems constrained by semilinear elliptic problems. By combining the shape sensitivity analysis and level set method, agradient descentalgorithm is proposed to solve the model problem. Different from solving the nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations with finite differences in traditional level set methods, we solve the linear convection equation and reinitialization equation using the characteristic Galerkin finite element method. The methodology can handle topology as well as shape changes in both regular and irregular design regions. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm as well as to verify symmetry preserving and breaking properties of optimal subdomains. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper discusses issues encountered by the hyperbolic method for diffusion (Nishikawa, 2007)[1] in dimensional heat conduction problems, and proposes a practical resolution. It is shown that the relaxation length must be scaled by a reference length of a domain of interest for solving dimensional equations, and the corresponding non-dimensionalized length should be given an optimal value for fast iterative convergence. To achieve both, a practical formula is proposed for computing a reference length for a given computational grid, such that (2 pi)(-1) gives an optimal value for rectangular domains and also serves as an effective approximation for general domains. Numerical results confirm that the proposed scaling is critically important for rendering hyperbolic diffusion schemes independent of the grid unit and for achieving optimal performance of a hyperbolic diffusion solver.

AB We develop a numerical method for simulating coupled interactions of complex floating structures with large-scale ocean waves and atmospheric turbulence. We employ an efficient large-scale model to develop offshore wind and wave environmental conditions, which are then incorporated into a high resolution two-phase flow solver with fluid-structure interaction (FSI). The large-scale wind-wave interaction model is based on a two-fluid dynamically-coupled approach that employs a high-order spectral method for simulating the water motion and a viscous solver with undulatory boundaries for the air motion. The two-phase flow FSI solver is based on the level set method and is capable of simulating the coupled dynamic interaction of arbitrarily complex bodies with airflow and waves. The large-scale wave field solver is coupled with the near-field FSI solver with a one-way coupling approach by feeding into the latter waves via a pressure-forcing method combined with the level set method. We validate the model for both simple wave trains and three-dimensional directional waves and compare the results with experimental and theoretical solutions. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of the new computational framework by carrying out large-eddy simulation of a floating offshore wind turbine interacting with realistic ocean wind and waves.

ID RADIAL BASIS FUNCTIONS; PDES
AB This paper describes a high order accurate method to calculate integrals over curved surfaces with boundaries. Given data locations that are arbitrarily distributed over the surface, together with some functional description of the surface and its boundary, the algorithm produces matching quadrature weights. This extends on the authors' earlier methods for integrating over the surface of a sphere and over arbitrarily shaped smooth closed surfaces by also considering domain boundaries. The core approach consists again of combining RBF-FD (radial basis function-generated finite difference) approximations for curved surface triangles, which together make up the full surface. The provided examples include both curved and flat domains. In the highly special case of equi-spaced nodes over a regular interval in 1-D, the method provides a new opportunity for improving on the classical Gregory enhancements of the trapezoidal rule.

AB We propose a nodal high-order discontinuous Galerkin method for 1D wave propagation in nonlinear media. We solve the elastodynamic equations written in the velocity-strain formulation and apply an upwind flux adapted to heterogeneous media with nonlinear constitutive behavior coupling stress and strain. Accuracy, convergence and stability of the method are studied through several numerical applications. Hysteresis loops distinguishing loading and unloading-reloading paths are also taken into account. We investigate several effects of nonlinearity in wave propagation, such as the generation of high frequencies and the frequency shift of resonant peaks to lower frequencies. Finally, we compare the results for both nonlinear models, with and without hysteresis, and highlight the effects of the former on the stabilization of the numerical scheme. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB An important but missing component in the application of the kernel independent fast multipole method (KIFMM) is the capability for flexibly and efficiently imposing singly, doubly, and triply periodic boundary conditions. In most popular packages such periodicities are imposed with the hierarchical repetition of periodic boxes, which may give an incorrect answer due to the conditional convergence of some kernel sums. Here we present an efficient method to properly impose periodic boundary conditions using a near-far splitting scheme. The near-field contribution is directly calculated with the KIFMM method, while the far-field contribution is calculated with a multipole-to-local (M2L) operator which is independent of the source and target point distribution. The M2L operator is constructed with the far-field portion of the kernel function to generate the far-field contribution with the downward equivalent source points in KIFMM. This method guarantees the sum of the near-field & far-field converge pointwise to results satisfying periodicity and compatibility conditions. The computational cost of the far-field calculation observes the same O(N) complexity as FMM and is designed to be small by reusing the data computed by KIFMM for the near-field. The far-field calculations require no additional control parameters, and observes the same theoretical error bound as KIFMM. We present accuracy and timing test results for the Laplace kernel in singly periodic domains and the Stokes velocity kernel in doubly and triply periodic domains. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper, we develop a novel finite difference method to discretize the fractional Laplacian (-Delta)(alpha/2) in hypersingular integral form. By introducing a splitting parameter, we formulate the fractional Laplacian as the weighted integral of a weak singular function, which is then approximated by the weighted trapezoidal rule. Compared to other existing methods, our method is more accurate and simpler to implement, and moreover it closely resembles the central difference scheme for the classical Laplace operator. We prove that for u is an element of C-3,C-alpha/2 (R), our method has an accuracy of O(h(2)) uniformly for any alpha is an element of(0, 2), while for u is an element of C-1,C-alpha/2 (R), the accuracy is O(h(1-alpha/2)). The convergence behavior of our method is consistent with that of the central difference approximation of the classical Laplace operator. Additionally, we apply our method to solve the fractional Poisson equation and study the convergence of its numerical solutions. The extensive numerical examples that accompany our analysis verify our results, as well as give additional insights into the convergence behavior of our method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB We analyze a free-surface problem described by time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations. Surface tension, capillary effects and wall friction are taken into account in the evolution of the system, influencing the motion of the contact line - where the free surface hits the wall - and of the dynamics of the contact angle. The differential equations governing the phenomenon are first derived from the variational principle of minimum reduced dissipation, and then discretized by means of the ALE approach. The numerical properties of the resulting scheme are investigated, drawing a parallel with the physical properties holding at the continuous level. Some instability issues are addressed in detail, in the case of an explicit treatment of the geometry, and novel additional terms are introduced in the discrete formulation in order to damp the instabilities. Numerical tests assess the suitability of the approach, the influence of the parameters, and the effectiveness of the new stabilizing terms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A stable numerical solution of the steady Stokes problem requires compatibility between the choice of velocity and pressure approximation that has traditionally proven problematic for meshless methods. In this work, we present a discretization that couples a staggered scheme for pressure approximation with a divergence-free velocity reconstruction to obtain an adaptive, high-order, finite difference-like discretization that can be efficiently solved with conventional algebraic multigrid techniques. We use analytic benchmarks to demonstrate equal-order convergence for both velocity and pressure when solving problems with curvilinear geometries. In order to study problems in dense suspensions, we couple the solution for the flow to the equations of motion for freely suspended particles in an implicit monolithic scheme. The combination of high-order accuracy with fully-implicit schemes allows the accurate resolution of stiff lubrication forces directly from the solution of the Stokes problem without the need to introduce sub-grid lubrication models.

AB We study the evaluation of layer potentials close to the domain boundary. Accurate evaluation of layer potentials near boundaries is needed in many applications, including fluid-structure interactions and near-field scattering in nano-optics. When numerically evaluating layer potentials, it is natural to use the same quadrature rule as the one used in the Nystrom method to solve the underlying boundary integral equation. However, this method is problematic for evaluation points close to boundaries. For a fixed number of quadrature points, N, this method incurs O(1) errors in a boundary layer of thickness O(1/N). Using an asymptotic expansion for the kernel of the layer potential, we remove this O(1) error. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method for interior and exterior problems for Laplace's equation in two dimensions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Mixed finite element methods provide a generalisation of staggered grid finite difference methods with a framework to extend the method to high orders. The ability to generate a high order method is appealing for applications on the kind of quasi-uniform grids that are popular for atmospheric modelling, so that the method retains an acceptable level of accuracy even around special points in the grid. The dispersion properties of such schemes are important to study as they provide insight into the numerical adjustment to imbalance that is an important component in atmospheric modelling. This paper extends the recent analysis of the P-2-P-1(DG) pair, that is a quadratic continuous and linear discontinuous finite element pair, to higher polynomial orders and also spectral element type pairs. In common with the previously studied element pair, and also with other schemes such as the spectral element and discontinuous Galerkin methods, increasing the polynomial order is found to provide a more accurate dispersion relation for the well resolved part of the spectrum but at the cost of a number of unphysical spectral gaps. The effects of these spectral gaps are investigated and shown to have a varying impact depending upon the width of the gap. Finally, the tensor product nature of the finite element spaces is exploited to extend the dispersion analysis into two-dimensions. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper develops a new fifth order accurate Hermite WENO (HWENO) reconstruction method for hyperbolic conservation schemes in the framework of the two-stage fourth order accurate temporal discretization in Li and Du (2016) [13]. Instead of computing the first moment of the solution additionally in the conventional HWENO or DG approach, we can directly take the interface values, which are already available in the numerical flux construction using the generalized Riemann problem (GRP) solver, to approximate the first moment. The resulting scheme is fourth order temporal accurate by only invoking the HWENO reconstruction twice so that it becomes more compact. Numerical experiments show that such compactness makes significant impact on the resolution of nonlinear waves. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A new algorithm for numerical evaluation of spherical Bessel transform is proposed in this paper. In this method, the spherical Bessel function is approximately represented as an exponential sum with complex parameters. This is obtained by expressing an integral representation of spherical Bessel function in complex plane, and discretizing contour integrals along steepest descent paths and a contour path parallel to real axis using numerical quadrature rule with the double-exponential transformation. The number of terms in the expression is reduced using the modified balanced truncation method. The residual part of integrand is also expanded by exponential functions using Prony-like method. The spherical Bessel transform can be evaluated analytically on arbitrary points in half-open interval. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, an adaptive finite element method is proposed for solving Kohn-Sham equation with the multilevel correction technique. In the method, the Kohn-Sham equation is solved on a fixed and appropriately coarse mesh with the finite element method in which the finite element space is kept improving by solving the derived boundary value problems on a series of adaptively and successively refined meshes. A main feature of the method is that solving large scale Kohn-Sham system is avoided effectively, and solving the derived boundary value problems can be handled efficiently by classical methods such as the multigrid method. Hence, the significant acceleration can be obtained on solving Kohn-Sham equation with the proposed multilevel correction technique. The performance of the method is examined by a variety of numerical experiments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Local multiscale methods often construct multiscale basis functions in the offline stage without taking into account input parameters, such as source terms, boundary conditions, and so on. These basis functions are then used in the online stage with a specific input parameter to solve the global problem at a reduced computational cost. Recently, online approaches have been introduced, where multiscale basis functions are adaptively constructed in some regions to reduce the error significantly. In multiscale methods, it is desired to have only 1-2 iterations to reduce the error to a desired threshold. Using Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Framework [10], it was shown that by choosing sufficient number of offline basis functions, the error reduction can be made independent of physical parameters, such as scales and contrast. In this paper, our goal is to improve this. Using our recently proposed approach [4] and special online basis construction in oversampled regions, we show that the error reduction can be made sufficiently large by appropriately selecting oversampling regions. Our numerical results show that one can achieve a three order of magnitude error reduction, which is better than our previous methods. We also develop an adaptive algorithm and enrich in selected regions with large residuals. In our adaptive method, we show that the convergence rate can be determined by a user-defined parameter and we confirm this by numerical simulations. The analysis of the method is presented.

AB We apply a hyperbolic cell-centered finite volume method to solve a steady diffusion equation on unstructured meshes. This method, originally proposed by Nishikawa using a node-centered finite volume method, reformulates the elliptic nature of viscous fluxes into a set of augmented equations that makes the entire system hyperbolic. We introduce an efficient and accurate solution strategy for the cell-centered finite volume method. To obtain high-order accuracy for both solution and gradient variables, we use a successive order solution reconstruction: constant, linear, and quadratic (k-exact) reconstruction with an efficient reconstruction stencil, a so-called wrapping stencil. By the virtue of the cell-centered scheme, the source term evaluation was greatly simplified regardless of the solution order. For uniform schemes, we obtain the same order of accuracy, i.e., first, second, and third orders, for both the solution and its gradient variables. For hybrid schemes, recycling the gradient variable information for solution variable reconstruction makes one order of additional accuracy, i.e., second, third, and fourth orders, possible for the solution variable with less computational work than needed for uniform schemes. In general, the hyperbolic method can be an effective solution technique for diffusion problems, but instability is also observed for the discontinuous diffusion coefficient cases, which brings necessity for further investigation about the monotonicity preserving hyperbolic diffusion method.

AB From the very origins of numerical hydrodynamics in the Lagrangian work of von Neumann and Richtmyer [83], the issue of total energy conservation as well as entropy production has been problematic. Because of well known problems with mesh deformation, Lagrangian schemes have evolved into Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) methods [39] that combine the best properties of Lagrangian and Eulerian methods. Energy issues have persisted for this class of methods. We believe that fundamental issues of energy conservation and entropy production in ALE require further examination.
   The context of the paper is an ALE scheme that is extended in the sense that it permits cyclic or periodic remap of data between grids of the same or differing connectivity. The principal design goals for a remap method then consist of total energy conservation, bounded internal energy, and compatibility of kinetic energy and momentum. We also have secondary objectives of limiting velocity and stress in a non-directional manner, keeping primitive variables monotone, and providing a higher than second order reconstruction of remapped variables.
   In particular, the new contributions fall into three categories associated with: energy conservation and entropy production, reconstruction and bounds preservation of scalar and tensor fields, and conservative remap of nonlinear fields. The paper presents a derivation of the methods, details of implementation, and numerical results for a number of test problems. The methods requires volume integration of polynomial functions in polytopal cells with planar facets, and the requisite expressions are derived for arbitrary order. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) is an effective Lagrangian method for modeling complex fluids in the mesoscale regime but so far it has been limited to relatively simple geometries. Here, we formulate a local detection method for DPD involving arbitrarily shaped geometric three-dimensional domains. By introducing an indicator variable of boundary volume fraction (BVF) for each fluid particle, the boundary of arbitrary-shape objects is detected on-the-fly for the moving fluid particles using only the local particle configuration. Therefore, this approach eliminates the need of an analytical description of the boundary and geometry of objects in DPD simulations and makes it possible to load the geometry of a system directly from experimental images or computer-aided designs/drawings. More specifically, the BVF of a fluid particle is defined by the weighted summation over its neighboring particles within a cutoff distance. Wall penetration is inferred from the value of the BVF and prevented by a predictor-corrector algorithm. The no-slip boundary condition is achieved by employing effective dissipative coefficients for liquid-solid interactions. Quantitative evaluations of the new method are performed for the plane Poiseuille flow, the plane Couette flow and the Wannier flow in a cylindrical domain and compared with their corresponding analytical solutions and (high-order) spectral element solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. We verify that the proposed method yields correct no-slip boundary conditions for velocity and generates negligible fluctuations of density and temperature in the vicinity of the wall surface. Moreover, we construct a very complex 3D geometry - the "Brown Pacman" microfluidic device - to explicitly demonstrate how to construct a DPD system with complex geometry directly from loading a graphical image. Subsequently, we simulate the flow of a surfactant solution through this complex microfluidic device using the new method. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by examining the rich dynamics of surfactant micelles, which are flowing around multiple small cylinders and stenotic regions in the microfluidic device without wall penetration. In addition to stationary arbitrary-shape objects, the new method is particularly useful for problems involving moving and deformable boundaries, because it only uses local information of neighboring particles and satisfies the desired boundary conditions on-the-fly.

AB The interaction of light with metallic nanostructures produces a collective excitation of electrons at the metal surface, also known as surface plasmons. These collective excitations lead to resonances that enable the confinement of light in deep-subwavelength regions, thereby leading to large near-field enhancements. The simulation of plasmon resonances presents notable challenges. From the modeling perspective, the realistic behavior of conduction-band electrons in metallic nanostructures is not captured by Maxwell's equations, thus requiring additional modeling. From the simulation perspective, the disparity in length scales stemming from the extreme field localization demands efficient and accurate numerical methods.
   In this paper, we develop the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method to solve Maxwell's equations augmented with the hydrodynamic model for the conduction-band electrons in noble metals. This method enables the efficient simulation of plasmonic nanostructures while accounting for the nonlocal interactions between electrons and the incident light. We introduce a novel postprocessing scheme to recover superconvergent solutions and demonstrate the convergence of the proposed HDG method for the simulation of a 2D gold nanowire and a 3D periodic annular nanogap structure. The results of the hydrodynamic model are compared to those of a simplified local response model, showing that differences between them can be significant at the nanoscale. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Collision detection of a large number N of particles can be challenging. Directly testing N particles for collisions among each other leads to N-2 queries. Especially in scenarios, where fast, densely packed particles interact, challenges arise for classical methods like Particle-in-Cell or Monte-Carlo. Modern collision detection methods utilising bounding volume hierarchies are suitable to overcome these challenges and allow a detailed analysis of the interaction of large number of particles. This approach is applied to the analysis of the collision of two photon beams leading to the creation of electron-positron pairs. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An accurate and predictive modelling of slug flows is required by many industries (e.g., oil and gas, nuclear engineering, chemical engineering) to prevent undesired events potentially leading to serious environmental accidents. For example, the hydrodynamic and terrain-induced slugging leads to unwanted unsteady flow conditions. This demands the development of fast and robust numerical techniques for predicting slug flows. The presented in this paper study proposes a multi-fluid model and its implementation method accounting for phase appearance and disappearance. The numerical modelling of phase appearance and disappearance presents a complex numerical challenge for all multicomponent and multi-fluid models. Numerical challenges arise from the singular systems of equations when some phases are absent and from the solution discontinuity when some phases appear or disappear. This paper provides a flexible and robust solution to these issues. A fully implicit formulation described in this work enables to efficiently solve governing fluid flow equations. The proposed numerical method provides a modelling capability of phase appearance and disappearance processes, which is based on switching procedure between various sets of governing equations. These sets of equations are constructed using information about the number of phases present in the computational domain. The proposed scheme does not require an explicit truncation of solutions leading to a conservative scheme for mass and linear momentum. A transient two-fluid model is used to verify and validate the proposed algorithm for conditions of hydrodynamic and terrain-induced slug flow regimes. The developed modelling capabilities allow to predict all the major features of the experimental data, and are in a good quantitative agreement with them. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The in vivo determination of selenomethionine (SeMet) converted from selenium-enriched yeast (SeY) rather than the determination of in vitro hydrolyzed SeMet is a better parameter for the evaluation of SeY quality. A UPLC-MS/MS method was developed for the quantification of SeMet in rat plasma and the oral bioavailability of SeMet converted from SeY in rats. After a simple extraction with perchloric acid, SeMet and the internal standard methylselenocysteine (MSC) were separated on a C18 column with isocratic elution of water: acetonitrile: formic acid (99:1:0.1, v/v/v) and detected in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. The method was accurate (92.6-104.3%) and precise (1.8-11.0%), and the recovery was 79.4-95.4%. It was successfully applied to pharmacokinetic and bioavailability studies of SeY in rats following the intravenous administration of SeMet and intragastric administration of SeY. SeMet in vivo, converted from SeY, is reported for the first time, and the results suggested that the SeY bioavailability in rats is 87%.

AB Conventional multivariate and compositional data analyses were applied tentatively to investigate the effects of processing steps and fat extraction systems on the fatty acid profiles of green Spanish-style Gordal table olives. In the first case, the profiles (expressed in percentages) were subjected directly to a conventional statistical study. Secondly, the profiles were regarded as data in the Simplex space and subjected to its specific tools or transformed into coordinates in the Euclidean space to be analysed by conventional multivariate techniques. Exploratory classical and compositional data analyses showed that the main changes were due to fermentation. Tentative cluster and PCA analyses using the compositional coordinates in the Euclidean space led to a more realistic segregation among treatments than applying percentages. Overall, the results suggested that the fatty acid profiles of table olives should be considered as compositional data and analysed accordingly.

AB Here, we developed a rapid and robust supercritical fluid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SFC-MS/MS) method for simultaneous detection of fenbuconazole and its chiral metabolites in fruit, vegetable, cereal, and soil. Baseline separation of six stereoisomers was achieved on an amylose tris-(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate)-coated chiral column in 4.0 min using a mobile phase composed of CO2/ethanol (flow rate of 1.8 mL/min). Ionisation efficiency and sensitivity was optimized with a post-column compensation solvent (0.1% formic acid/methanol). Target analytes were extracted with acetonitrile and purified using dispersive solid phase extraction sorbents. Six stereoisomers at three concentrations (5, 50, and 250 mu g/kg) achieved satisfactory recoveries (76.3-104.6%) with RSDs <= 11.5% Excellent linearities (R-2 = 0.9963) and the limits of quantification (LOQs, 0.13-3.31 mu g/kg) were established for all six stereoisomers. Results show that the proposed method is suitable for routine detection of six stereoisomers of fenbuconazole and its chiral metabolites in food and environmental samples.

AB The copper contents in vineyard soil, grape must and wine and the relationship among them in the Huaizhuo Basin Region, China, were investigated. The results showed that the copper pollution status in vineyard soils, grapes and wines in the investigated area in China is under control, with only 4 surface soil (0-20 cm) samples over maximum residue limits (MRL) and no grape or wine samples over MRL. Different vineyards, grape varieties, vine ages, and training systems all significantly influenced the copper contents in the vineyard soils, grape and wines. Additionally, the copper levels in the vineyard soils, grapes and wines all had some correlation. In wine samples, the copper contents ranged from 0.52 to 663 mu g/L, which is only approximately one percent the level found in grapes and one ten-thousandth that found in soils. Of the wine samples, red wines showed a significantly higher copper content than white wines, while in the red/white grape and soil samples, no significant differences were observed.

AB Honey is a complex biological substance, consisting mainly of sugars, phenolic compounds and enzymes. Using five quick and accessible assays for measuring honey's cytotoxicity in vitro, we found honey is cytotoxic towards prostate cancer cells PC3 and DU145. However, the level of cell death varied with assay. The MTT assay was confounded by the reduction of the MTT reagent by honey's reducing sugars and phenolic compounds, and the lactate dehydrogenase assay was invalidated by honey oxidising the enzyme cofactor NADH. The sulforhodamine B assay gave valid results, but measures only protein content, providing no information about cell death in the remaining cells. The trypan blue assay and a microscope-based propidium iodide/Hoechst staining assay assess only late stage membrane permeability. However, the propidium iodide/Hoechst assay gives morphological information about cell death mechanism. A combination of the sulforhodamine B and propidium iodide/Hoechst assays would provide the most accurate quantification of honey cytotoxicity.

AB Tocotrienol microcapsules (TM) were formed by firstly preparing Pickering emulsion containing tocotrienols, which was then gelled into microcapsules using alginate and chitosan. In this study, we examined the stability of TM during storage and when applied into a model food system, i.e. yogurt. During storage at 40 degrees C, TM displayed remarkably lower tocotrienols loss (50.8%) as compared to non-encapsulated tocotrienols in bulk oil (87.5%). When the tocotrienols were incorporated into yogurt, the TM and bulk oil forms showed a loss of 23.5% and 81.0%, respectively. Generally, the tocotrienols were stable in the TM form and showed highest stability when these TM were added into yogurt. delta-Tocotrienol was the most stable isomer in both forms during storage and when incorporated into yogurt. The addition of TM into yogurt caused minimal changes in the yogurt's color and texture but slightly altered the yogurt's viscosity.

AB The present work explored the lipid antioxidant capacity of citrus pectin addition to 5% (w/v) linseed/sunflower oil emulsions stabilized with 0.5% (w/v) Tween 80, as affected by pectin molecular characteristics. The peroxide formation in the emulsions, containing tailored pectin structures, was studied during two weeks of storage at 35 degrees C. Low demethylesterified pectin (<= 33%) exhibited a higher antioxidant capacity than high demethylesterified pectin (>= 58%), probably due to its higher chelating capacity of pro- oxidative metal ions (Fe2+), whereas the distribution pattern of methylesters along the pectin chain only slightly affected the antioxidant capacity. Nevertheless, pectin addition to the emulsions caused emulsion destabilization probably due to depletion or bridging effect, independent of the pectin structural characteristics. These results evidence the potential of structurally modified citrus pectin as a natural antioxidant in emulsions. However, optimal conditions for emulsion stability should be carefully selected.

AB Sea urchin gonad has been regarded as a healthy food. Although previous studies have suggested that sea urchin gonad might serve as a potential rich source of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA) enriched phospholipid (PL), the molecular species profile of its PL has rarely been reported. In this study, about 200 molecular species of glycerophospholipid (GP), including glycerophosphocholine, glycerophosphoethanolamine, glycerophosphoserine, glycerophosphoinositol, lysoglycerophosphocholine and lysoglycerophosphoethanolamine, in gonads from three species of sea urchin (Glyptocidaris crenularis, Strongylocentrotus intermedius and Strongylocentrotus nudus) were characterized using tandem mass spectrometry. Most of the predominant GP molecular species contained PUFA, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Meanwhile, the sea urchin lipids contained a high proportion of PL (39.45-50.30% of total lipids) and PUFA (34.47-46.56% of total FA). Among PL, phosphatidylcholine (67.88-72.58 mol%) was dominant. Considering the high level of PUFA enriched GP, sea urchin gonads provide great potential as health-promoting food for human consumption.

AB In this study, pectin was isolated from Opuntia ficus indica (OFI) cladodes after removing mucilage using the xylanase and cellulase. The process variables were optimized by the Box Behnken design with three factors at three levels. The optimal extraction condition obtained was: liquid to solid (LS), cellulase to xylanase and enzymes to matter ratios of 22 ml/g, 2:1 U/U and 4 U/g, respectively. The simulated extraction yield of 17.91% was validated by the experimental result (16.67 +/- 0.30). The enzyme-extracted pectin from OFI cladodes (EAEPC) was low methylated, with a high uronic acid content, a water and oil holding capacity of 5.42 g/g and 1.23 g/g, respectively, a good foam and emulsion stability and important DPPH radical scavenging activity. Both the OFI cladodes and enzymatic process present promising alternatives to traditional sources and extraction processes of pectin, respectively. EAEPC thus represents a promising additive in food industries.

AB The present work investigated the physicochemical and structural properties of Tulsi, Alfalfa and two varieties of Manuka honey derived from medicinal plants. Chemical analysis yielded data on the content of reducing sugars (glucose and fructose) that dominate the honey matrix, and of the minor constituents of protein, phenols and flavonoids. Standard chemical assays were used to develop a database of water content, electrical conductivity, pH, ash content, visual appearance and colour intensity. Physicochemical characteristics were related to structural behaviour of the four honey types, as recorded by small-deformation dynamic oscillation in shear, micro-and modulated differential scanning calorimetry, wide angle X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy. The preponderance of hydrogen bonds in intermolecular associations amongst monosaccharides in honey yields a semi-amorphous or semi-crystalline system. That allowed prediction of the calorimetric and mechanical glass transition temperatures that demarcate the passage from liquid-like to solid-like consistency at subzero temperatures.

AB Nine state-of-the-art reversed phase (RP) columns for ultra-high performance liquid chromatography were tested for the separation of steviol glycosides. The main criteria were resolution of the critical peak pair rebaudioside A and stevioside and the retention time of rebaudioside D. Three columns yielded a resolution of 2 or more of the critical peak pair and two of them showed sufficient retention of rebaudioside D, namely 1.62 and 1.84 min corresponding to retention factors of 0.98 and 1.24. The separation of nine steviol glycosides was possible in 11 min with UV and MS compatible, buffer-free eluents at moderate temperature. The presented method is proposed to be adopted as a new official method.

AB As edible flowers are highly perishable, irradiation technology can be applied to increase their shelf life, as also for phytosanitary purposes. Herein, flowers of Bauhinia variegata L. var. candida alba Buch.- Ham were submitted to electron beam irradiation at the doses of 0.5, 0.8 and 1 kGy, to study the effects in the nutritional and chemical profiles, and also in antioxidant, cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory activities. The petals of white flowers revealed interesting bioactive properties being kaempferol derivatives the most abundant compounds, especially kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside. The applied irradiation doses did not highly affect the nutritional profile. No changes were produced in cytotoxicity, but the anti-inflammatory activity slightly decreased. However, the antioxidant activity was increased, especially in the dose of 0.5 kGy, in agreement with the higher content in phenolic compounds found at this dose.

AB This study reports the effect of different doses of nitrogen applied to soil and/or leaves of Syrah and Chardonnay grapevines in the Languedoc-Roussillon (France) over two years. In 2011, nitrogen treatment involved both foliar urea sprayings and soil application at two different levels, with two controls -irrigated without nitrogen and no irrigation nor nitrogen. In 2012, the same grapevines received either soil or foliar nitrogen using the same controls. Results showed that foliar application increased the amino acid content to a greater extent than soil application, but that a combination of both was the most effective. For the first time, significantly elevated proline levels in response to drought were demonstrated for the grapevine. Increased contents of aromatic compounds and glycosylated precursors closely mirrored the applied nitrogen dose. Wines produced from N-fertilized Syrah grapes in 2011 showed a statistically significant effect of irrigation and fertilization on positive sensorial perception.

The isolated compounds were identified as rutin (1), (-)-catechin (2), orobol (3), daidzein (4), tricin 4'-O-[threo-beta-guaiacyl-(7 ''-O-methyl)-glyceryl] ether (5), tricin 4'-O-[ threo-beta-guaiacyl-(7.-Omethyl- 9 ''-O-acetyl)-glyceryl] ether (6), 5,7,3', 5'-tetrahydroxyflavanone (7), artselaeroside A (8), trilobatin (9), 3-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propan-1-one (10), quercetin-3-O-(3 ''-O-galloyl)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (11), apigenin (12) and quercetin (13) on the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy along with comparison with literature data. Among these compounds, quercetin and quercetin-3-O-(3 ''-O-galloyl)- a-L-rhamnopyranoside exhibited potent DPPH radical-scavenging activity with IC50 (Half Maximal Inhibitory Concentration) value of 6.06 and 9.60 mu g/mL, respectively. The results revealed that P. ussuriensis could be used in the fields of food and medicine to prevent human aging diseases.

AB An ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography/hybrid quadrupole time-of-fight mass spectrometry (UPLC/QTOF-MS) method for the simultaneous identification and quantification of 50 multi-class pesticides in minor fruits is reported. The method consists of a sample extraction step, followed by analysis of the pesticides by UPLC/QTOF-MS. Satisfactory chromatographic separation was achieved over a 20 min runtime. The pesticides were identified by the accurate mass measurements of the protonated molecules ([M+H](+)) and their main fragment ions, isotopic pattern analysis and retention time matching. The mass accuracy obtained was below 2 ppm error for all the pesticides analysed. The method was validated by spiking starfruit with the 50 analytes. Satisfactory results regarding sensitivity and linearity were obtained. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of 87 real-world starfruit and Indian jujube samples, demonstrating its applicability for the routine analysis of multiple pesticide residues in minor tropical fruits.

AB This work seeks to understand the kinetics of O-2 and SO2 consumption of air-saturated red wine as a function of its chemical composition, and to describe the chemical changes suffered during the process in relation to the kinetics. Oxygen Consumption Rates (OCRs) are faster with higher copper and epigallocatechin contents and with higher absorbance at 620 nm and slower with higher levels of gallic acid and catechin terminal units in tannins. Acetaldehyde Reactive Polyphenols (ARPs) may be key elements determining OCRs. It is confirmed that SO2 is poorly consumed in the first saturation. Phenylalanine, methionine and maybe, cysteine, seem to be consumed instead. A low SO2 consumption is favoured by low levels of SO2, by a low availability of free SO2 caused by a high anthocyanin/tannin ratio, and by a polyphenolic profile poor in epigallocatechin and rich in catechin-rich tannins. Wines consuming SO2 efficiently consume more epigallocatechin, prodelphinidins and procyanidins.

AB Durian, known for its abundant nutrition, is a delicious fruit from Southeast Asia with increasing popularity worldwide. In this study, a series of chromatographic methods and bioactivity assays were applied to identify major compounds from durian shells. Two new triterpenoids, two new phenolics, and seven new glycoside esters, as well as sixteen known compounds, were isolated and identified. Anti-inflammatory activities were assayed and evaluated for the isolated compounds. Most of the isolated compounds exhibited pronounced inhibitory activities on lipopolysaccharides-induced NO production in RAW 264.7 cells. The results indicated that durian shells could serve as anti-inflammatory agents for functional food or medicinal use. This study additionally provided motivation for the ecological protection of durian shells.

AB To help future quality checks, we characterized the physico-chemical and sensory properties of Dittaino bread, a sourdough-based durum wheat bread recently awarded with Protected Designation of Origin mark, along with the quality features of re-milled semolina used for its production. Semolina was checked for Falling Number (533-644 s), protein content (12.0-12.3 g/100 g d. m.), gluten content (9.7-10.5 g/100 g d. m.), yellow index (18.0-21.0), water absorption (59.3-62.3 g/100 g), farinograph dough stability (171-327 s), softening index (46-66 B. U.), alveograph W (193 x10(-4) -223 x10(-4) J) and P/L (2.2-2.7). Accordingly, bread crumb was yellow, moderately hard (16.4-27.1 N) and chewy (88.2-109.2 N xmm), with low specific volume (2.28-3.03 mL/g). Bread aroma profile showed ethanol and acetic acid, followed by hexanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-phenylethanol, 3-methylbutanal, hexanal, benzaldehyde, and furfural. The sensory features were dominated by a thick brown crust, with marked toasted odor, coupled to yellow and consistent crumb, with coarse grain and well-perceivable sour taste and odor.

AB Tuber crops substantially contribute to the food security in the developing countries. Often, their cultivation involves unregulated applications of pesticides, leading to MRL non-compliances. Despite their rising currency in international trade, there exist scarcely any methods for pesticide residue analysis in these matrices. Therefore, we developed a multi-residue method for simultaneous analysis of a diverse range of pesticides in tuber crops, based on pressurized liquid extraction by ethyl acetate, followed by selective identification and quantification of the residues using GC-MS selected reaction monitoring. The method was evaluated for 150 pesticides. Results showed that their limits of quantification were 0.1-10 ng/g, with recoveries of 70-120%. When compared to the conventional analytical techniques, such as QuEChERS and buffered ethyl acetate extraction, this method provided superior performance in terms of precision, and recovery of the spiked and incurred residues with similar productivity. The method holds promise for commercial and regulatory residue analysis.

AB A simple, sensitive and inexpensive LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for for the simultaneous detection and quantification of (five) neonicotinoid insecticides in sugarcane juice. The juice samples were extracted with acetonitrile and subsequent cleanup was done by dispersive solid-phase extraction (QuEChERS method). The quantification was carried out by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization source (LC-ESI-MS/MS). After the optimization of the extraction parameters, the method was validated by evaluating linearity, limits of detection and quantification, precision (repeatability) and accuracy (recovery). Validation was based on analyses at three fortification levels that showed satisfactory recoveries (62.06-129.93%) and high precision (RSDs between 2.52% and 14.57%). Detection levels for all the five analytes ranged from 0.0007 to 0.002 mu g g(-1) and quantification level ranged from 0.002 to 0.005 mu g g(-1), respectively.

AB Multi-functional phenolic emulsifiers were prepared by covalently coupling beta-Lactoglobulin (beta Lg) to caffeic acid (CA) using crosslinker chemistry at different pH conditions (pH 2.5, 6.0, and 8.5). The resulting bioconjugates were characterized by MALDI-TOF MS, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), fluorescence-quenching, infrared and circular dichroism spectroscopies. Furthermore, the emulsifying and antioxidant properties of beta Lg-CA conjugates were evaluated and compared to native beta-Lactoglobulin and the non-covalent beta-lactoglobulin/caffeic complex (beta Lg/CA). Results showed: 1) An optimal molar ratio (8: 1) of caffeic acid to beta Lg was obtained at pH 6; 2) DPPH activity of beta Lg-CA increases as the number of CA units coupled increases; 3) beta Lg-CA conjugates displayed comparable or superior water solubility than native beta Lg and beta Lg/CA. Moreover, DSC results showed that coupling of CA with beta Lg significantly increased the thermal stability of beta Lg. In summary, beta Lg-CA conjugates can act as effective antioxidant emulsifiers and stabilizers and may find application in food and cosmetic industries.

The liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis resulted in quantification of 14 of the 45 phenolic compounds examined, with ellagic acid as the most dominant. Notable antioxidant activity of all three species was confirmed through several assays. Moderate inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by extracts of all investigated Rosa species was observed. Several extracts of examined Rosa species demonstrated inhibition potency towards production of some monitored eicosanoids in cyclooxygenase-1 and 12-lipoxygenase pathways. Two R. sempervirens extracts exerted cytotoxic activity against HeLa and HT-29 cell lines, but were inactive towards MRC-5 and MCF7. The results support the potential of these rose hips as food with health-promoting properties.

AB The results from this study showed that cell wall prepared from Rhodosporidium paludigenum induced strong disease resistance against blue mold rot caused by Penicillium expansum in pear fruit. Yeast cell wall reduced germination of P. expansum in vitro and in fruit wounds after 24 h of treatment. Moreover, the cell wall treatment significantly enhanced the activities of defense-related enzymes (beta-1,3-glucanase and chitinase) and the genes expression of PR proteins (PR1-like, endoGLU9, endoCHI-like and PR4), which may be an important mechanism by which cell wall reduces the fungal disease of pear fruit caused by P. expansum. These findings suggest that the mechanism by which R. paludigenum induced fruit resistance was linked to the function of its cell wall and application of cell wall might be a useful strategy for the control of postharvest disease in pear fruit.

AB Changes in phenolic profiles and color parameters can help to differentiate between extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs) with protected designation of origin (PDO). Phenolic profile characterization and CIELAB parameters determination of 9 PDO EVOOs from Spain were developed. Both properties of EVOOs are very relevant to their commercialization and increase the product value. The Serrana de Espadon olive cultivar was characterized for the first time and showed the highest pinoresinol concentrations and clarities in these olive oils, which are important values for the product image. To detect fraudulent instrumental work and implement quality control, principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were performed. EVOO geographical origin and cultivar distributions were achieved with cumulative variances of 93.4% and 92.4%, respectively.

AB In this study, a lycopene-content-based discriminant analysis was performed using a portable near-infraredexcited Raman spectrometer. In the vegetable-juice Raman spectra, the peak intensity of the lycopene band increased with increasing lycopene concentration, but scattering decreased the repeatability of the peak intensity. Consequently, developing a lycopene-concentration regression model using peak intensity is not straightforward. Therefore, a new method known as the product of mean intensity ratio (PMIR) analysis was developed to rapidly identify lycopene-rich samples on-site. In the PMIR analysis, Raman spectra are measured with short exposure times, confirming only the peaks of carotenoids with high concentrations, and thus the lycopene concentrations of vegetable juice samples could be determined successfully. Exposure times of 20 ms and 100 ms could detect lycopene concentrations of >= 5 mg/100 g and >= 2 mg/100 g with 93.2% and 97.7% accuracy, respectively; thus, lycopene-content-based discriminant analysis using the PMIR and a portable Raman spectrometer is feasible.

AB Coconut cake, a by-product from milk and oil extractions, contains a high amount of protein. Protein extraction from coconut milk cake and coconut oil cake was investigated. The supernatant and precipitate protein powders from both coconut milk and oil cakes were compared based on their physicochemical and functional properties. Glutelin was the predominant protein fraction in both coconut cakes. Protein powders from milk cake presented higher water and oil absorption capacities than those from oil cake. Both protein powders from oil cake exhibited better foaming capacity and a better emulsifying activity index than those from milk cake. Coconut proteins were mostly solubilized in strong acidic and alkaline solutions. Minimum solubility was observed at pH 4, confirming the isoelectric point of coconut protein. Therefore, the coconut residues after extractions might be a potential alternative renewable plant protein source to use as a food ingredient to enhance food nutrition and quality.

AB The popularity of transglutaminase (TG) by the food industry and the variation in functionality of this enzyme from different origins, prompted us to isolate and evaluate a high-yielding TG strain. Through the statistical approaches, Plackett-Burman and response surface methodology, a low cost fermentation media was obtained to produce 6.074 +/- 0.019 U mL(-1) of TG from a novel source; Streptomyces sp. CBMAI 1617 (SB6). Its potential exploitation was compared to commonly used TG, from Streptomyces mobaraensis. Biochemical and FT-IR studies indicated differences between SB6 and commercial TG (Biobond (TM) TG-M). Additions of TG to wheat protein and flour based doughs revealed that the dough stretching depended on the wheat protein fraction, TG amount and its origin. A higher degree of cross-linking of glutenins and of inclusion of gliadin in the polymers was seen for SB6 as compared to commercial TG. Thus, our results support the potential of SB6 to tailor wheat protein properties within various food applications.

AB Parabens are common preservatives and environmental hormones. As such, possible detrimental health effects could be amplified through their widespread use in foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical products. Thus, the determination of parabens in such products is of particular importance. This study explored vortex-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction techniques based on the solidification of a floating organic drop (VADLLME-SFO) and salt-assisted cloud point extraction (SA-CPE) for paraben extraction. Microanalysis was performed using a capillary liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection system. These techniques were modified successfully to determine four parabens in 19 commercial products. The regression equations of these parabens exhibited good linearity (r(2) = 0.998, 0.1-10 mu g/mL), good precision (RSD < 5%) and accuracy (RE < 5%), reduced reagent consumption and reaction times (< 6 min), and excellent sample versatility. VA-DLLME-SFO was also particularly convenient due to the use of a solidified extract. Thus, the VA-DLLME-SFO technique was better suited to the extraction of parabens from complex matrices.

AB As preharvest sprouting of wheat impairs its use in food applications, postharvest solutions for this problem are required. Due to the high kernel to kernel variability in enzyme activity in a batch of sprouted wheat, the potential of eliminating severely sprouted kernels based on density differences in NaCl solutions was evaluated. Compared to higher density kernels, lower density kernels displayed higher alpha-amylase, endoxylanase, and peptidase activities as well as signs of (incipient) protein, beta-glucan and arabinoxylan breakdown. By discarding lower density kernels of mildly and severely sprouted wheat batches (11% and 16%, respectively), density separation increased flour FN of the batch from 280 to 345 s and from 135 to 170 s and increased RVA viscosity. This in turn improved dough handling, bread crumb texture and crust color. These data indicate that density separation is a powerful technique to increase the quality of a batch of sprouted wheat.

AB Peanut seeds are rich in oil, which exists as oil bodies (OBs). By extraction, peanut crude OBs are obtained and can be used as a food ingredient. In a previous study, it was found that the crude OBs contained an unknown protease, which hydrolyzed the oleosins. This would disrupt the integrity of OBs, and therefore, affect their physical and oxidative stability. In this study, the protein composition of crude OBs and some properties of the unknown protease were examined. The results showed that the protease was a two-chain (32 and 9 kDa) aspartic protease, which showed high affinity for OBs. The optimal pH and temperature for oleosin hydrolysis by the protease were pH 4.0 and 60 degrees C. Interestingly, the aspartic protease not only hydrolyzed OB intrinsic proteins (oleosin, caleosin, and steroleosin), but also extrinsic proteins (especially Ara h 1 allergen and 26-30 kDa arachin).

AB Leaves of a new variety of Stevia rebaudiana with a high content of rebaudioside A were pretreated with ethanol. The ethanolic extract showed high antioxidant potential and 39 compounds were identified, by UPLC/HRMS, among them one not yet mentioned in the literature for stevia leaves. From the in natura leaves and pretreated leaves, the conditions of aqueous extraction of steviol glycosides were investigated using response surface methodology. The aqueous extracts obtained were purified by ion exchange chromatography techniques and membrane separation methods. The recuperation of steviol glycosides was 4.02 g for pretreated leaves and 2.20 g for in natura leaves. The level of purity was, respectively, 87% and 84.8%. The results obtained demonstrate that pretreatment increases the yield and purity level of stevia sweeteners by the use of environmentally friendly methodologies and the final product presented acceptable sensory characteristics.

AB Antioxidant properties of five catechins and five other flavonoids were compared with several other natural and synthetic compounds and related to glutathione and ascorbate as key endogenous antioxidants in several in vitro tests and assays involving erythrocytes. Catechins showed the highest ABTS(+) -scavenging capacity, the highest stoichiometry of Fe3+ reduction in the FRAP assay and belonged to the most efficient compounds in protection against SIN-1 induced oxidation of dihydrorhodamine 123, AAPH-induced fluorescein bleaching and hypochlorite-induced fluorescein bleaching. Glutathione and ascorbate were less effective. (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were the most effective compounds in protection against AAPH-induced erythrocyte hemolysis while (-)-epicatechin gallate, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate and (-)-epigallocatechin protected at lowest concentrations against hypochlorite-induced hemolysis. Catechins [(-)-epigallocatechin gallate and (-)-epicatechin gallate)] were most efficient in the inhibition of AAPH-induced oxidation of 2'7'-dichlorodihydroflurescein contained inside erythrocytes. Excellent antioxidant properties of catechins and other flavonoids make them ideal candidates for nanoformulations to be used in antioxidant therapy.

AB Introduction: Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive evidence exploring vaccine decision-making among newcomers. We conducted a systematic review of qualitative studies aimed at identifying factors that influence newcomers' decision-making with regards to vaccination.
   Methods: We conducted a search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane Central. To be included, studies needed to employ a qualitative methodology and address newcomer attitudes, beliefs, and/or perceptions regarding vaccination. Two independent reviewers screened the articles for relevant information and applied a content analysis methodology to code the identified barriers.
   Results: Twenty-one studies were included in this review, and four types of barriers were identified: cultural factors, knowledge barriers, insufficient access to healthcare, and vaccine hesitancy. Insufficient knowledge about vaccination and the virus being prevented and concerns about safety were the most commonly reported barriers. A sub-analysis of barriers specific to HPV indicated that cultural beliefs about sexuality and incomplete knowledge about the role of HPV in the development of cervical cancer are major barriers to vaccine uptake.
   Conclusion: Strategies to improve vaccination uptake in newcomers should consider focusing on the barriers identified in this review while taking into account the unique opportunities for promoting uptake within newcomer populations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a respiratory pathogen of chickens, causing severe economic losses in poultry industry worldwide. Live attenuated viruses are widely used in both the broiler and layer industry because of their efficacy and ability to be mass applied. Recently, we established a novel reverse genetics system based on targeted RNA recombination to manipulate the genome of IBV strain H52. Here we explore the possibilities to attenuate IBV in a rational way in order to generate safe and effective vaccines against virulent IBV (van Beurden et al., 2017). To this end, we deleted the nonessential group-specific accessory genes 3 and/or 5 in the IBV genome by targeted RNA recombination and selected the recombinant viruses in embryonated eggs. The resulting recombinant (r) rIBV-Delta 3ab, rIBV-Delta 5ab, and rIBV-Delta 3ab5ab could be rescued and grew to the same virus titer as recombinant and wild type IBV strain H52. Thus, genes 3ab and 5ab are not essential for replication in ovo. When administered to one-day-old chickens, rIBV-Delta 3ab, rIBV-Delta 5ab, and rIBV-Delta 3ab5ab showed reduced ciliostasis as compared to rIBV H52 and wild type H52, indicating that the accessory genes contribute to the pathogenicity of IBV. After homologous challenge with the virulent IBV strain M41, all vaccinated chickens were protected against disease based on reduced loss of ciliary movement in the trachea compared to the non vaccinated but challenged controls. Taken together, deletion of accessory genes 3ab and/or 5ab in IBV resulted in mutant viruses with an attenuated phenotype and the ability to induce protection in chickens. Hence, targeted RNA recombination based on virulent IBV provides opportunities for the development of a next generation of rationally designed live attenuated IBV vaccines. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB We conducted a serological survey of anti-polio antibodies in polio high-risk areas of Mali, Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire to assess risk of future poliovirus outbreaks.
   Random community sampling of children 6-11 and 36-48 months-old was conducted; neutralizing antibodies against poliovirus were detected using microneutralization assay.
   We analysed 1059/1064 (99.5%) of enrolled children. Seroprevalence to poliovirus type 1 (PV1) across all age groups and locations ranged between 92 and 100%, for PV2 it was 77-100%, and 89-95% for PV3. PV2 seroprevalence in the younger age group in Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire was <80%. History of <4 polio vaccine doses and acute malnutrition were associated with seronegativity (OR = 2.1 CI95% = 1.5-3.1, OR = 1.8 CI95% = 1.1-33 respectively).
   The risk of poliovirus outbreak following importation is low because of high population immunity to PV1, however, due to large cohort of PV2 seronegative children any future detection of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 requires urgent response to arrest rapid spread.

AB Background: Previous interventions in colleges to improve human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination have not been highly successful. Although barriers have been assessed in traditional colleges, less is known about vaccination barriers in community colleges.
   Methods: We approached students aged 18-26 years old enrolled at a community college for an in person semi-structured qualitative interview on HPV vaccination and health, with questions guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior. Data collection took place between April 2015 and December 2015. Thematic analysis techniques were used to analyze the data.
   Results: During interviews with 19 students, 4 themes emerged, including: general vaccine attitudes, barriers to HPV vaccination, motivators to HPV vaccination, and social influences. Participants felt that vaccines were beneficial, but were concerned about side effects. They felt that getting the HPV vaccine would be inconvenient, and they did not know enough about it to decide. Most would not trust their friends' opinions, but would want to know about side effects that their vaccinated friends experienced.
   Conclusions: Successful interventions at community colleges should include several components to increase convenience as well as utilize interactive methods to promote HPV vaccine awareness. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC), a leading cause of avian airsacculitis and colibacillosis, is responsible for significant economic loss in the poultry industry. APEC serogroups O1, O2, and O78 are predominantly associated with disease. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen has been shown to be a potent antigen for inducing specific protective immune responses. Therefore, we sought to develop a multivalent polysaccharide vaccine to prevent most APEC infections. We previously reported the stable expression of plasmid pSS27 encoding the APEC O1 O-antigen gene cluster (10.8 kb) in attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium S740 provided excellent protection against APEC O1 challenge. In this study, the plasmid pSS28 harboring the APEC O2 O-antigen polysaccharide gene cluster (15.5 kb) was constructed. Biosynthesis of pSS28-encoded APEC O2 O-antigen in Salmonella vaccine strain S740 was validated by Western blot. The recombinant Salmonella vaccine strain S740 (pSS28) elicited homologous protection against virulent wild-type APEC O2 challenge in a chicken model. Furthermore, through equal-volume mixing the two monovalent vaccine strains 5740 (pSS27) and S740 (pSS28), a bivalent vaccine candidate against both APEC O1 and O2 was developed. Immunization of chickens with the bivalent vaccine elicited production of serum IgG and mucosal sIgA antibodies against the LPS of both APEC O1 and O2. Moreover, antibodies induced by the bivalent vaccine promoted opsonization, provoked complement-mediated bactericidal activity, and elicited protection against lethal challenge with both virulent APEC O1 and O2 strains. These results demonstrate that the bivalent vaccine comprised of 5740 (pSS27) and 5740 (pSS28) is a promising vaccine candidate against APEC O1 and O2 infection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The emergence of multidrug-resistant isolates high-lights the need to develop alternative strategies for treatment of P. aeruginosa infections. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are spherical nanometer-sized proteolipids that are secreted from numerous of pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, and a number of studies have confirmed the protective efficacy for use of OMVs as candidate vaccines. In this study, OMVs from P. aeruginosa (PA_OMVs) were isolated, formulated with aluminum phosphate adjuvant and used as a vaccine in a mouse model of acute lung infection. The results confirmed that active immunization with PA_OMVs was able to reduce bacterial colonization, cytokine secretion and tissue damage in the lung tissue, thus protecting mice from lethal challenge of P. aeruginosa. Cytokines assay validated that immunization with PA_OMVs was efficient to induce a mixed cellular immune response in mice. Further, high level of specific antibodies was detected in mice immunized with PA_OMVs, and results from opsonophagocytic killing assay and passive immunization suggested that humoral immune response may be critical for PA_OMVs mediated protection. These findings demonstrated that PA_OMVs may be served as a novel candidate vaccine for the prevention of P. aeruginosa infection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: We assessed the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in children 6 months to 15 years of age in 2015/16 season. In addition, based on the data obtained during the three seasons from 2013 to 2016, we estimated the three-season VE in preventing influenza illness and hospitalization.
   Methods: Our study was conducted according to a test-negative case-control design (TNCC) and as a case control study based on influenza rapid diagnostic test results.
   Results: During 2015/16 season, the quadrivalent IIV was first used in Japan. The adjusted VE in preventing influenza illness was 49% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 42-55%) against any type of influenza, 57% (95% CI: 50-63%) against influenza A and 34% (95% CI: 23-44%) against influenza B. The 3-season adjusted VE was 45% (95% CI: 41-49%) against influenza virus infection overall (N = 12,888), 51% (95% CI: 47-55%) against influenza A (N = 10,410), and 32% (95% CI: 24-38%) against influenza B (N = 9232). An analysis by age groups showed low or no significant VE in infants or adolescents. By contrast, VE was highest in the young group (1-5 years old) and declined with age thereafter. The 3-season adjusted VE in preventing hospitalization as determined in a case-control study was 52% (95% CI: 42-60%) for influenza A and 28% (95% CI: 4-46%) for influenza B, and by TNCC design, it was 54% (95% CI: 41-65%) for influenza A and 34% (95% CI: 6-54%) for influenza B.
   Conclusion: We demonstrated not only VE in preventing illness, but also VE in preventing hospitalization based on much larger numbers of children than previous studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID IMMUNIZATION
AB Since 2013, World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) should be evaluated by a standardized algorithm for causality assessment, however the use of WHO procedure is rarely adopted. In Italy, AEFIs (classified only by temporal criteria) are registered in the National Drug Authority (AIFA) database, but causality assessment is not mandatory. Every year AIFA publishes the AEFIs report, that doesn't contain information about causal correlation between events and vaccines. From AIFA database, we selected AEFIs following human papillomavirus vaccination (HPV) reported in Apulia (about 4,000,000 inhabitants) during 2008-2016. For serious AEFIs, we applied WHO causality assessment criteria; for cases hospitalized, we repeated the assessment getting additional information from health documentation. In 2008-2016, 100 HPV AEFIs (reporting rate: 17.8 per 100,000 doses) were registered of which 19 were serious (rate: 3.4 per 100,000 doses) and 12 led to hospitalization. After causality assessment, for 9 AEFIs the classification was "consistent causal association to immunization", for 3 indeterminate, for 5 "inconsistent causal association to immunization" and for 2 not-classifiable. Among hospitalized patients, 5 AEFIs were consistent, 5 inconsistent, 1 not-classifiable and 1 indeterminate; adding information from health documentation, the results were similar except for indeterminate and not classifiable AEFIs that turned into "not consistent". Only half of severe AEFIs could be associated with vaccination and this suggests that AIFA report provides a incomplete picture of HPV vaccine safety, with a risk for readers to confound "post hoc" and "propter hoc" approach without considering the causality assessment results. In the view of the systematic use of WHO causality assessment algorithm in the AEFI surveillance, the efforts of Public Health must be focused on the improvement of the quality of the information provided to reduce conclusions inter-observer variability; the routine follow-up of reports, also to collect additional information, must be guaranteed.

AB A foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) recombinant subunit vaccine formulated with a lipid/polymer adjuvant was evaluated in two vaccine efficacy challenge studies in steers. The vaccine active ingredient is a replication-deficient human adenovirus serotype 5 vector encoding the FMD virus (FMDV) A24/Cruzeiro/BRA/55 capsid (AdtA24). In the first study, AdtA24 formulated in ENABL (R) adjuvant was compared to a fourfold higher dose of AdtA24 without adjuvant. Steers vaccinated with AdtA24 + ENABL (R) adjuvant developed a significantly higher virus neutralizing test (VNT) antibody titer and an improved clinical response following FMDV A24/Cruzeiro/BRA/55 intradermal lingual challenge at 14 days post vaccination (dpv) than steers vaccinated with the active ingredient alone. In the second study, vaccination with AdtA24 formulated in ENABL (R) at the same dose used in the first study, followed by FMDV A24/Cruzeiro/BRA/55 challenge on 7 or 14 dpv, prevented clinical FMD in all steers and conferred 90% protection against viremia. In addition, post-challenge FMDV titers in nasal samples from vaccinated steers compared to unvaccinated steers were significantly reduced. In both studies, none of the AdtA24 vaccinated steers developed antibodies to the FMDV non-structural proteins prior to challenge with FMDV, indicative of the capacity to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). These results demonstrate that administration of AdtA24 formulated in ENABL (R) adjuvant lowered the protective dose and prevented clinical FMD following exposure of vaccinated steers to virulent FMDV at 7 or 14 dpv.

AB Background: Financial concerns are often cited by physicians as a barrier to administering routinely recommended vaccines to adults. The purpose of this study was to assess perceived payments and profit from administering recommended adult vaccines and vaccine purchasing practices among general internal medicine (GIM) and family medicine (FM) practices in the United States.
   Methods: We conducted an interviewer-administered survey from January-June 2014 of practices stratified by specialty (FM or GIM), affiliation (standalone or >= 2 practice sites), and level of financial decision making (independent or larger system level) in FM and GIM practices that responded to a previous survey on adult vaccine financing and provided contact information for follow-up. Practice personnel identified as knowledgeable about vaccine financing and billing responded to questions about payments relative to vaccine purchase price and payment for vaccine administration, perceived profit on vaccination, claim denial, and utilization of various purchasing strategies for private vaccine stocks. Survey items on payment and perceived profit were assessed for various public and private payer types. Descriptive statistics were calculated and responses compared by physician specialty, practice affiliation, and level of financial decision-making.
   Results: Of 242 practices approached, 43% (n = 104) completed the survey. Reported payment levels and perceived profit varied by payer type. Only for preferred provider organizations did a plurality of respondents report profiting on adult vaccination services. Over half of respondents reported losing money vaccinating adult Medicaid beneficiaries. One-quarter to one-third of respondents reported not knowing about Medicare Part D payment levels for vaccine purchase and vaccine administration, respectively. Few respondents reported negotiating with manufacturers or insurance plans on vaccine purchase prices or payments for vaccination.
   Conclusions: Practices vaccinating adults may benefit from education and technical assistance related to vaccine financing and billing and greater use of purchasing strategies to decrease upfront vaccine cost. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Influenza A virus (IAV) in swine constitutes a major economic burden for producers as well as a potential threat to public health. Whole inactivated virus vaccines (WIV) are the predominant countermeasure employed to control IAV in swine herds in the United States despite the superior protection, and diminished adverse effects, induced by live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV). A major hurdle for the development of LAIV exists in achieving the proper level of attenuation while maintaining immunogenicity. Using Synthetic Attenuated Virus Engineering (SAVE) to introduce codon-pair bias de-optimization (CPBD) into the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene segments of pandemic H1N1 IAV, a novel LAIV was produced and evaluated for attenuation, immunogenicity, and efficacy in pigs. The CPBD LAIV induced inappreciable pathology following intranasal administration yet induced robust serum and mucosal antibody titers. CPBD LAIV vaccinated pigs challenged with wild-type virus showed protection from disease and virus detection, highlighted by the absence of detectable virus titers in the nasal passages and lungs. These results demonstrate the efficacy of a LAIV designed by SAVE codon de optimization in pigs, providing support for the continued development of CPBD LAIV for use in swine.

AB Avian hepatitis E virus (aHEV) is a pathogen associated with hepatitis-splenomegaly syndrome in chickens. To date, no commercial vaccine is available for preventing aHEV infection. In this study, three recombinant LactococcuslactisNZ9000experimental live vaccines expressing cytoplasmic, secreted, and cell wall-anchored forms of aHEV truncated ORF2 protein spanning amino acids 249-606 (Delta ORF2) were constructed using pTX8048 vector and characterized. Each chicken was immunized three times at two-week intervals with one of the three live aHEV ORF2 vaccines (experimental group) or with live vaccine containing empty vector only (control group). Both groups were then challenged with aHEV and evaluated to compare immune responses and immunogenic effects. Serum IgG levels, secretory IgA (sigA) levels in bile and jejunal lavage fluid, and mRNA expression levels oflL-2 and IFN-gamma in liver and spleen were significantly higher in experimental chickens than in controls. Meanwhile, post-challenge serum and fecal virus loads were significantly lower in experimental chickens versus controls. Moreover, on day 7 post infection (PI), serum lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were significantly higher in controls than experimental chickens. Furthermore, at day 28 PI, obvious gross pathological lesions and histopathological changes typical for aHEV infection were observed in control livers and spleens, with only moderate pathological changes observed in the experimental group. The results of this study collectively demonstrate that an oral vaccineusing L.lactisNZ9000 as a delivery vector for aHEV immunogenic antigen could effectively control aHEV infection of chickens.

AB Background: Adoption of varicella immunization in Europe is limited due to a predicted increase in the incidence of herpes zoster (HZ) resulting from a removal of exogenous boosting by varicella vaccination. Most available assessments of immunization strategies only considered universal varicella vaccination (alone or in combination with HZ by the live vaccine). The development of a new subunit recombinant zoster vaccine may provide new perspectives of HZ control.
   Methods: We used a mathematical model for VZV in Norway based on the progressive immunity formulation of exogenous boosting. We evaluated a complete range of alternative immunization options against varicella and HZ including both universal and targeted varicella vaccination, either alone or with zoster immunization, and zoster immunization alone. We considered all values of the boosting intensity consistent with the Norwegian HZ incidence and compared the performance of the currently available live vaccine vs. a new recombinant vaccine.
   Results: Universal varicella vaccination alone resulted in a marked increase in the incidence of HZ under all scenarios considered. Even under the most favorable hypotheses on the magnitude of the boosting intensity, this increase could be mitigated only by a parallel HZ immunization with a recombinant vaccine, assuming a long duration of protection. Targeted varicella immunization of adolescents resulted in a modest increase in the HZ incidence which could be counterbalanced by both the live and, especially, the recombinant vaccine.
   Conclusions: Given current knowledge on HZ pathogenesis and exogenous boosting, targeted varicella vaccination of adolescents was the only strategy that was not predicted to impact the epidemiology of HZ, and therefore it may represent a suitable alternative to universal vaccination. These results are aimed to support vaccine policy decisions in Norway and other countries with a similar VZV epidemiology. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine if conjugating a recombinant Eimeria maxima protein, namely EmaxIMP1, into 20 nm polystyrene nanoparticles (NP) could improve the level of protective immunity against E. maxima challenge infection. Recombinant EmaxIMP1 was expressed in Escherichia coli as a poly-His fusion protein, purified by NiNTA chromatography, and conjugated to 20 nm polystyrene NP (NP-EmaxIMP1). NP-EMaxIMP1 or control non-recombinant (NP-NR) protein were delivered per os to newly-hatched broiler chicks with subsequent booster immunizations at 3 and 21 days of age. In battery cage studies (n = 4), chickens immunized with NP-EMaxIMP1 displayed complete protection as measured by weight gain (WG) against E. maxima challenge compared to chickens immunized with NP-NR. WG in the NP-EMaxIMP1-immunized groups was identical to WG in chickens that were not infected with E. maxima infected chickens. In floor pen studies (n = 2), chickens immunized with NP-EMaxIMP1 displayed partial protection as measured by WG against E. maxima challenge compared to chickens immunized with NP-NR. In order to understand the basis for immune stimulation, newly-hatched chicks were inoculated per os with NP-EMaxIMP1 or NP-NR protein, and the small intestine, bursa, and spleen, were examined for NP localization at 1 h and 6 h post-inoculation. Within 1 h, both NP-EMaxIMP1 and NP NR were observed in all 3 tissues. An increase was observed in the level of NP-EmaxIMP1 and NP-NR in all tissues at 6 h post-inoculation. These data indicate that 20 nm NP-EmaxIMP1 or NP-NR reached deeper tissues within hours of oral inoculation and elicited complete to partial immunity against E. maxima challenge infection.

AB Indirubin is an indole alkaloid that can be used to treat various diseases including granulocytic leukemia, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. Microbial production of indirubin has so far been achieved by supplementation of rather expensive substrates such as indole or tryptophan. Here, we report the development of metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strain capable of producing indirubin directly from glucose. First, the Methylophaga aminisulfidivorans flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) and E. coli tryptophanase (TnaA) were introduced into E. coli in order to complete the biosynthetic pathway from tryptophan to indirubin. Further engineering was performed through rational strategies including disruption of the regulatory repressor gene trpR and removal of feedback inhibitions on AroG and TrpE. Then, combinatorial approach was employed by systematically screening eight genes involved in the common aromatic amino acid pathway. Moreover, availability of the aromatic precursor substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose-4-phosphate, was enhanced by inactivating the pykF (pyruvate kinase I) and pykA (pyruvate kinase II) genes, and by overexpressing the tktA gene (encoding transketolase), respectively. Fed-batch fermentation of the final engineered strain led to production of 0.056 g/L of indirubin directly from glucose. The metabolic engineering and synthetic biology strategies reported here thus allows microbial fermentative production of indirubin from glucose.

AB Streptomyces peucetius ATCC 27952 is a filamentous soil bacterium with potential to produce anthracyclines such as doxorubicin (DXR) and daunorubicin (DNR), which are potent chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. Here we present the complete genome sequence of S. peucetius ATCC 27952, which consists of 8,023,114 bp with a linear chromosome, 7187 protein-coding genes, 18 rRNA operons and 66 tRNAs. Bioinformatic analysis of the genome sequence revealed similar to 68 putative gene clusters involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, including diverse classes of natural products. Diverse secondary metabolites of PKS (polyketide synthase) type II (doxorubicin and daunorubicin), NRPS (non-ribosomal peptide synthase) (T1-pks), terpene (hopene) etc. have already been reported for this strain. In addition, in silico analysis suggests the potential to produce diverse compound classes such as lantipeptides, lassopeptides, NRPS and polyketides. Furthermore, many catalytically-efficient enzymes involved in hydroxylation, methylation etc. have been characterized in this strain. The availability of genomic information provides valuable insight for devising rational strategies for the production and isolation of diverse bioactive compounds as well as for the industrial application of efficient enzymes.

AB Centrifugation continues to be one of the most commonly used unit operations for achieving efficient harvest of the product from the mammalian cell culture broth during production of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Since the mammalian cells are known to be shear sensitive, optimal performance of the centrifuge requires a balance between productivity and shear. In this study, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been successfully used as a tool to facilitate efficient optimization. Multiphase Eulerian-Eulerian model coupled with Gidaspow drag model along with Eulerian-Eulerian k-epsilon mixture turbulence model have been used to quantify the complex hydrodynamics of the centrifuge and thus evaluate the turbulent stresses generated by the centrifugal forces. An empirical model has been developed by statistical analysis of experimentally observed cell lysis data as a function of turbulent stresses. An operating window that offers the optimal balance between high productivity, high separation efficiency, and low cell damage has been identified by use of CFD modeling.

AB Lettuce (Lactuca sativa, L.) is an important annual plant of the family Asteraceae (Compositae). The commercial lettuce cultivar Tizian has been used in various scientific studies investigating the interaction of the plant with phytopathogens or biological control agents. Here, we present the de novo draft genome sequencing and gene prediction for this specific cultivar derived from transcriptome sequence data. The assembled scaffolds amount to a size of 2.22 Gb. Based on RNAseq data, 31,112 transcript isoforms were identified. Functional predictions for these transcripts were determined within the GenDBE annotation platform. Comparison with the cv. Salinas reference genome revealed a high degree of sequence similarity on genome and transcriptome levels, with an average amino acid identity of 99%. Furthermore, it was observed that two large regions are either missing or are highly divergent within the cv. Tizian genome compared to cv. Salinas. One of these regions covers the major resistance complex 1 region of cv. Salinas. The cv. Tizian draft genome sequence provides a valuable resource for future functional and transcriptome analyses focused on this lettuce cultivar.

AB Bacteriophage binding mechanisms to multi-modal anion exchange resin may include both anion exchange and hydrophobic interactions, or the mechanism can be dominated by a single moiety. However, previous studies have reported binding mechanisms defined for simple solutions containing only buffer and a surrogate viral spike (i.e. bacteriophage FX174, PR772, and PP7). We employed phage spiked in-process monoclonal antibody (mAb) pools to model binding under bioprocessing conditions. These experiments allow the individual contributions of the mAb, in-process impurities, and buffer composition on mechanistic removal of phages to be studied. PP7 and PR772 use synergetic binding by the positively charged quaternary amine and the hydrophobic aromatic phenyl group to bind multi-modal resin. Phi X174's binding mechanism remains inconclusive due to operating conditions.

AB Microbial intracellular biopolymer PHA was synthesized from toxic pollutant phenol by an acclimated consortium. Various operational conditions were experimented for their effects on biomass growth and PHA accumulation. Carbon to nitrogen ratios from 5 to 40 (w/w) showed little impact, as did the levels of Fe, Ca and Mg in a short term. Acidic pH inhibited both growth and PHA synthesis, and an optimal dissolved oxygen level of 1-4 mg L-1 was identified. Low temperature (7 degrees C) significantly slowed but did not totally repress microbial activities. A 2% NaCl shock retarded reactions and 4% NaCl caused irreversible damage. Various initial phenol (S0) and biomass concentrations (X0) were combined to study the effect of food to microbe (F/M) ratio. High S0 and F/M exerted toxicity, reducing reaction rates but generating higher ultimate PHA wt% in biomass. Increasing X0 alleviated phenol inhibition and improved productivity and carbon conversion from phenol. A pseudo-optimized F/M ratio of 0.2-0.4 and a maximum PHA% rate of 1.15% min(-1) were identified under medium S0/high X0. This study is the first to systematically investigate the feasibility of toxic industrial waste as the carbon source for PHA production, and likely the only one indicating potential for scaling-up and industrialization.

TI Smelling Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections using a whole-cell biosensor

AB Improved easy-to-use diagnostic tools for infections are in strong demand worldwide. Yet, despite dramatic advances in diagnostic technologies, the gold-standard remains culturing. Here we offer an alternative tool demonstrating that a bacterial biosensor can efficiently detect Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in patients suffering from otitis externa. Detection was based on specific binding between the biosensor and 2-aminoacetophenone (2-AA), a volatile produced by P. aeruginosa in high amounts. We collected pus samples from ears of 26 subjects exhibiting symptoms of otitis externa. Detection of P. aeruginosa using the biosensor was compared to detection using gold-standard culturing assay and to gas-chromatograph-mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses of 2-AA. The biosensor strain test matched the culture assay in 24 samples (92%) and the GC-MS analyses in 25 samples (96%). With this result in hand, we designed a device containing a whole-cell luminescent biosensor combined with a photo-multiplier tube. This device allowed detection of 2-AA at levels as low as 2 nmol, on par with detection level of GC-MS. The results of the described study demonstrate that the volatile 2-AA serves as an effective biomarker for P. aeruginosa in ear infections, and that activation of the biosensor strain by 2-AA provides a unique opportunity to design an easy-to-use device that can specifically detect P. aeruginosa infections.

AB A growing body of evidence has reinforced the central role of microbiomes in the life of sound multicellular eukaryotes, thus more properly described as true holobionts. Though soil was considered a main source of plant microbiomes, seeds have been shown to be endophytically colonized by microorganisms thus representing natural carriers of a selected microbial inoculum to the young seedlings. In this work we have investigated the type of culturable endophytic bacteria that are carried within surface-sterilized alfalfa seeds. MALDI-TOF analysis revealed the presence of bacteria that belonged to 40 separate genera, distributed within four taxa (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes). Nonsymbiotic members of the Rhizobiaceae family were also found. The evaluation of nine different in-vitro biochemical activities demonstrated isolates with complex combinations of traits that, upon a Principal-Component-Analysis, could be classified into four phenotypic groups. That isolates from nearly half of the genera identified had been able to colonize alfalfa plants grown under axenic conditions was remarkable. Further analyses should be addressed to investigating the colonization mechanisms of the alfalfa seeds, the evolutionary significance of the alfalfa-seed endophytes, and also how after germination the seed microbiome competes with spermospheric and rhizospheric soil bacteria to colonize newly emerging seedlings.

AB The activation of the innate RNA interference pathway through double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) is one of the approaches to protecting shrimp from viruses. Previous studies have shown that injection of specific dsRNAs can successfully inhibit viral infection in shrimp. However, inhibition requires high levels of dsRNA and dsRNA stability in shrimp is limited. Virus-like particles (VLPs) have been applied to deliver nucleic acids into host cells because of the protection of dsRNAs from host endonucleases as well as the target specificity provided by VLPs. Therefore, this study aimed to develop Penaeus stylirostris densovirus (PstDNV) VLPs for dsRNA deliver to shrimp. The PstDNV capsid protein was expressed and can be self-assembled to form PstDNV VLPs. Co-expression of dsRNA-YHV-Pro and PstDNV capsid protein was achieved in the same bacterial cells, whose structure was displayed as the aggregation of VLPs by TEM. Tested for their inhibiting yellow head virus (YHV) from infecting shrimp, the dsRNA-YHV-Pro-PstDNV VLPs gave higher levels of YHV suppression and a greater reduction in shrimp mortality than the delivery of naked dsRNA-YHV-Pro. Therefore, PstDNV-VLPs are a promising vehicle for dsRNA delivery that maintains the anti-virus activity of dsRNA in shrimp over a longer period of time as compared to native dsRNAs.

AB Suspensions of the model microalga Chlorella sp. TISTR 8990 were pretreated by ohmic heating to facilitate release of lipids from the cells in subsequent extraction and lipase-mediated transesterification to biodiesel. After ohmic pretreatment, the moist biomass was suspended in a system of water, hexane, methanol and immobilized lipase for extraction of lipids and simultaneous conversion to biodiesel. The ohmic pretreatment was optimized using an experimental design based on Taguchi method to provide treated biomass that maximized the biodiesel yield in subsequent extraction-transesterification operation. The experimental factors were the frequency of electric current (5-105 Hz), the processing temperature (50-70 degrees C), the algal biomass concentration in the slurry (algal fresh weight to water mass ratio of 1-3) and the incubation time (1-3 min). Extraction-transesterification of the pretreated biomass was carried out at 40 degrees C for 24 h using a reaction systems of a fixed composition (i.e. biomass, hexane, methanol, water and immobilized enzyme). Compared to control (i.e. untreated biomass), the ohmic pretreatment under optimal conditions (5 Hz current frequency, 70 degrees C, 1: 2 mass ratio of biomass to water, incubation time of 2-min) increased the rate of subsequent transesterification by nearly 2-fold.

AB In August 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) convened the "Eighth meeting on development of influenza vaccines that induce broadly protective and long-lasting immune responses" to discuss the regulatory requirements and pathways for licensure of next-generation influenza vaccines, and to identify areas where WHO can promote the development of such vaccines. Participants included approximately 120 representatives of academia, the vaccine industry, research and development funders, and regulatory and public health agencies. They reviewed the draft WHO preferred product characteristics (PPCs) of vaccines that could address prioritized unmet public health needs and discussed the challenges facing the development of such vaccines, especially for low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). They defined the data desired by public-health decision makers globally and explored how to support the progression of promising candidates into late-stage clinical trials and for all countries. This report highlights the major discussions of the meeting. (C) 2017 World Health Organization. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Universal influenza vaccines are designed to protect against diverse strains of influenza virus. Preclinical testing of new vaccine candidates is usually done in naive animals, despite intended use in the human population with its varied immune history including responses to previous vaccinations. As an approach more relevant to human use, we tested a candidate universal influenza vaccine in mice with a history of conventional vaccination. Female BALB/c mice were given two intramuscular doses of inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) or diphtheria and tetanus toxoids vaccine (DT), one month apart. Another group was given two intranasal doses of live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV). One month after the second dose, mice were given the universal influenza vaccine: recombinant adenoviruses expressing influenza A nucleoprotein (A/NP) and matrix 2 (M2) (A/NP + M2-rAd). Immune responses to universal vaccine antigens A/NP and M2 were assessed by ELISA and interferon-gamma ELISPOT. Protection was tested by challenge with mouse-adapted A/FM/1/47 (H1N1) and monitoring for weight loss and survival. Universal vaccine performance was enhanced, inhibited or unaffected by particular prior vaccinations. Mice given Afluria IIV and LAIV had greater antibody and T-cell response to A/NP than mice without prior vaccination, providing examples of enhanced A/NP + M2-rAd performance. Though Fluvirin IIV partially inhibited, the universal vaccine still provided considerable protection unlike conventional vaccination. Fluzone IIV and DT had no effect on A/NP + M2-rAd performance. Thus our results demonstrate that universal vaccine candidate A/NP + M2-rAd was at least partially effective in mice with diverse prior histories. However, the degree of protection and nature of the immune responses may be affected by a history of conventional vaccination and suggests that performance in humans would be influenced by immune history.

AB Many industrialized countries have implemented routine immunization policies for older adults, but similar strategies have not been widely implemented in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In March 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) convened a meeting to identify policies and activities to promote access to vaccination of older adults, specifically in LMICs. Participants included academic and industry researchers, funders, civil society organizations, implementers of global health interventions, and stakeholders from developing countries with adult immunization needs. These experts reviewed vaccine performance in older adults, the anticipated impact of adult vaccination programs, and the challenges and opportunities of building or strengthening an adult and older adult immunization platforms. Key conclusions of the meeting were that there is a need for discussion of new opportunities for vaccination of all adults as well as for vaccination of older adults, as reflected in the recent shift by WHO to a life-course approach to immunization; that immunization in adults should be viewed in the context of a much broader model based on an individual's abilities rather than chronological age; and that immunization beyond infancy is a global priority that can be successfully integrated with other interventions to promote healthy ageing. As WHO is looking ahead to a global Decade of Healthy Ageing starting in 2020, it will seek to define a roadmap for interdisciplinary collaborations to integrate immunization with improving access to preventive and other healthcare interventions for adults worldwide.

AB Development of a new vaccine against tuberculosis is urgently needed. Recent work has demonstrated that two related LC3-associated trafficking pathways, autophagy and LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), enhance antigen presentation and might play a role in vaccine efficacy. Mycobacterium tuberculosis inhibits both LC3-trafficking pathways. Moreover, the vaccine strain, BCG, induces even less LC3-trafficking than M. tuberculosis, which may help explain its limited efficacy. To determine whether enhanced LC3-trafficking can improve efficacy of a live, attenuated M. tuberculosis vaccine, we took advantage of our recent finding that the bacterial virulence factor CpsA inhibits LAP. When we deleted cpsA in the mc(2)6206 vaccine strain, it dramatically increased LC3-trafficking. We compared the protective efficacy of the strain lacking cpsA to the parent strain and to BCG in mice challenged with M. tuberculosis. We found that the strain lacking cpsA generated modestly enhanced protection in the spleen, but overall did not outperform BCG. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Our aim was to assess the odds of hospitalization for a vaccine-preventable, infectious disease (VP-ID) in American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) children compared to other racial and ethnic groups using the 2012 Kid's Inpatient Database (KID) The KID is a nationally representative sample, which allows for evaluation of VP-ID in a non-federal, non-Indian Health Service setting. In a cross-sectional analysis, we evaluated the association of race/ethnicity and a composite outcome of hospitalization due to vaccine-preventable infection using multivariate logistic regression. AI/AN children were more likely (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.34, 2.45) to be admitted to the hospital in 2012 for a VP-ID compared to Non Hispanic white children after adjusting for age, sex, chronic disease status, metropolitan location, and median household income. This disparity highlights the necessity for a more comprehensive understanding of immunization and infectious disease exposure among American Indian children, especially those not covered or evaluated by Indian Health Service.

AB Objectives: To examine the effects of repeated influenza vaccination on medically-attended influenza (MAI) and acute respiratory illness (ARI) risk according to the antigenic matching between vaccine and circulating virus strains.
   Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized studies that compared the risk of MAI and ARI between subjects who had been vaccinated for two consecutive seasons (multiple vaccine group) and those who had been vaccinated in the current season and not in the previous season (single vaccine group).
   Results: Of 1467 articles identified, eight studies covering ten seasons were included in meta-analyses. Six studies assessed efficacy against MAI in children, yielding the risk ratios (RR) of 2.04 (95% CI 1.29-3.22) when circulating strains mismatched vaccine strains, and 0.64 (0.33-1.22) when circulating strains matched vaccine strains. When stratified by vaccine types, the reduced efficacy was significant for live attenuated influenza vaccine only. Three studies investigated efficacy against ARI in children, with the RR of 0.96 (0.81-1.15). The results on adults and the elderly were scarce.
   Conclusions: Influenza vaccine efficacy against mismatch strains was lower in repeatedly vaccinated children as compared with those vaccinated for the current season only. The scarcity of available studies may call for further randomized controlled trials on repeated influenza vaccination. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fasciola hepatica infection causes important economic losses in livestock and food industries around the world. In the Republic of Ireland F. hepatica infection has an 76% prevalence in cattle. Due to the increase of anti-helminthic resistance, a vaccine-based approach to control of Fasciolosis is urgently needed. A recombinant version of the cysteine protease cathepsin L1 (rmFhCL1) from F. hepatica has been a vaccine candidate for many years. We have found that vaccination of cattle with this immunodominant antigen has provided protection against infection in some experimental trials, but not in others. Differential epitope recognition between animals could be a source of variable levels of vaccine protection. Therefore, we have characterised for first time linear B-cell epitopes recognised within the FhCL1 protein using sera from F. hepatica-infected and/or vaccinated cattle from two independent trials. Results showed that all F. hepatica infected animals recognised the region 19-31 of FhCL1, which is situated in the N-terminal part of the pro-peptide. Vaccinated animals that showed fluke burden reduction elicited antibodies that bound to the regions 120-137, 145-155, 161-171 of FhCL1, which were not recognised by non-protected animals. This data, together with the high production of specific lgG2 in animals showing vaccine efficacy, suggest important targets for vaccine development. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Many travelers to regions with endemic infectious diseases do not follow health authorities' recommendations regarding vaccination against vaccine-preventable infectious diseases, before traveling. The determinants of individual travelers' decisions to vaccinate before traveling are largely unknown. This study aimed to provide this information using a discrete choice experiment (DCE) administered to four types of German travelers: (1) business travelers; (2) travelers visiting friends and relatives (VFR); (3) leisure travelers; and (4) backpackers.
   Methods: A DCE survey was developed, pretested and administered online. It included a series of choice questions in which respondents chose between two hypothetical vaccines, each characterized by four disease attributes with varying levels describing the of risk, health impact, curability and transmissibility of the disease they would prevent (described with four disease attributes with varying levels of risk, health impact, curability and transmissibility), and varying levels of four vaccine attributes (duration of protection, number of doses required, time required for vaccination, and vaccine cost). A random parameters logit model was used to estimate the importance weights each traveler type placed on the various attribute levels. These weights were used to calculate mean monetary equivalents (MMEs) of changes in each attribute (holding all others constant) and of hypothetical disease-vaccine combinations.
   Results: All traveler types' choices indicated that they attached the greatest importance to the risk and health impact of disease and to the vaccine cost whereas the other disease and vaccine attributes were less important for their decisions about travel vaccines. An option of not choosing any of the vaccine-pairs presented was rarely selected indicating that travelers' generally prefer to be vaccinated rather than not. The MMEs of changes in vaccine attributes indicated a very high variability between the individual travelers within each type.
   Conclusions: The travelers' responses indicated strong preferences for selecting vaccination rather than opting out of vaccination, and disease risk, health impact and vaccine cost were the most important features for vaccine choice.

AB Background: Current recommendations about dengue vaccination by the World Health Organization depend on seroprevalence levels and serological status in populations and individuals. However, seroprevalence estimation may be difficult due to a diversity of factors. Thus, estimation through models using data from epidemiological surveillance systems could be an alternative procedure to achieve this goal.
   Objective: To estimate the expected dengue seroprevalence in children of selected areas in Argentina, using a simple model based on data from passive epidemiological surveillance systems.
   Methods: A Markov model using a simulated cohort of individuals from age 0 to 9 years was developed. Parameters regarding the reported annual incidence of dengue, proportion of inapparent cases, and expansion factors for outpatient and hospitalized cases were considered as transition probabilities. The proportion of immune population at 9 years of age was taken as a proxy of the expected seroprevalence, considering this age as targeted for vaccination. The model was used to evaluate the expected seroprevalence in Misiones and Salta provinces and in Buenos Aires city, three settings showing different climatic favorability for dengue.
   Results: The estimates of the seroprevalence for the group of 9-year-old children for Misiones was 79% (95%CI:46-:100%), and for Salta 22% (95%CI:14-30%), both located in northeastern and northwestern Argentina, respectively. Buenos Aires city, from central Argentina, showed a likely seroprevalence of 7% (95%CI: 3-11%). According to the deterministic sensitivity analyses, the parameter showing the highest influence on these results was the probability of inapparent cases.
   Conclusions: This model allowed the estimation of dengue seroprevalence in settings where this information is not available. Particularly for Misiones, the expected seroprevalence was higher than 70% in a wide range of scenarios, thus in this province a vaccination strategy directed to seropositive children of >9 years should be analyzed, including further considerations as safety, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact.

AB Background: Infants with history of prematurity (<37 weeks gestation) and low birth weight (LBW, <2500 g) are at high risk of infection due to functional immaturity of normal physical and immunological defense mechanisms. Despite current recommendations that infants with history of prematurity/LBW should receive routine immunization according to the same schedule and chronological age as full-term infants, immunization is often delayed.
   Methods: Here we summarize 10 clinical studies and 15 years of post-marketing safety surveillance of GSK's hexavalent vaccine (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib), a combined diphtheria-tetanus-acellular-pertussis-hepati tis-B-inactivated-poliovirus-Haemophilus influenzae-type-b (Hib) conjugate vaccine, when administered alone, or co-administered with pneumococcal conjugate, rotavirus, and meningococcal vaccines and respiratory syncytial virus IgG to infants with history of prematurity/LBW in clinical trials.
   Results: At least 92.5% of infants with history of prematurity/LBW as young as 24 weeks gestation in clinical studies were seropositive to all vaccine antigens after 3-dose primary vaccination with GSK's hexavalent DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine, with robust immune responses to booster vaccination. Seropositivity rates and antibody concentrations to hepatitis B and Hib appeared lower in infants with history of prematurity/LBW than term infants. Between 13-30% of medically stable infants with history of prematurity developed apnea after vaccination with GSK's hexavalent DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine; usually after dose 1. The occurrence of post-immunization cardiorespiratory events appears to be influenced by the severity of any underlying neonatal condition. Most cardiorespiratory events resolve spontaneously or require minimal intervention. GSK's hexavalent DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine was well tolerated in co administration regimens.
   Conclusion: GSK's hexavalent DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine alone or co-administered with other pediatric vaccines has a clinically acceptable safety and immunogenicity profile when used in infants with history of prematurity/LBW for primary and booster vaccination. Additional studies are needed in very premature and very LBW infants. However, currently available data support using GSK's hexavalent DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine to immunize infants with history of prematurity/LBW according to chronological age. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB provide better value for money than trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs), we assessed the cost-effectiveness of TIV and QIV in low-and-middle income communities based in South Africa and Vietnam and contrasted these findings with those from a high-income community in Australia.
   Methods: Individual based dynamic simulation models were interfaced with a health economic analysis model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating 15% of the population with QIV or TIV in each community over the period 2003-2013. Vaccination was prioritized for HIV-infected individuals, before elderly aged 65+ years and young children. Country or region-specific data on influenza-strain circulation, clinical outcomes and costs were obtained from published sources. The societal perspective was used and outcomes were expressed in International$ (I$) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
   Results: When compared with TIV, we found that QIV would provide a greater reduction in influenza related morbidity in communities in South Africa and Vietnam as compared with Australia. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of QIV versus TIV was estimated at I$4183/QALY in South Africa, I $1505/QALY in Vietnam and I$80,966/QALY in Australia.
   Conclusions: The cost-effectiveness of QIV varied between communities due to differences in influenza epidemiology, comorbidities, and unit costs. Whether TIV or QIV is the most cost-effective alternative heavily depends on influenza B burden among subpopulations targeted for vaccination in addition to country-specific willingness-to-pay thresholds and budgetary impact.

AB Traditionally, vaccination strategies require an initial priming vaccination followed by an antigen boost to generate adequate immunity. Here we describe vaccination against a self-peptide for reproductive sterilization utilizing a three-stage vaccine platform consisting of gonadotropin releasing hormone multiple antigenic peptide (GnRH-MAP) as a soluble injection coupled with subcutaneous administration of polyanhydride-immobilized GnRH-MAP and a cyto-exclusive implant containing GnRH-MAP dendrimer-loaded polyanhydride. This strategy generated and maintained cell-mediated and humoral immunity for up to 41 weeks after a single vaccination in mice with enhanced antibody avidity over time. All intact implants had a grossly visible tissue interface with neovascularization and lymphocytic aggregates. Despite detectable immunity, sterility was not achieved and the immune response did not lead to azoospermia in male mice nor prevent estrus and ovulation in female mice. However, the vaccine delivery device is tunable and the immunogen, adjuvants and release rates can all be modified to enhance immunity. This technology has broad implications for the development of long-term vaccination schemes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB mib(nn2002), identified from an allele screen, shows early segmentation defect and severe cell death phenotypes, which are different from those of other described mib mutant alleles. We have previously reported its defects in somitogenesis and identified its origin of mutation, a large deletion in LG2. The report here is a continuous study, where we applied the bioinformatics analysis to profile the genetic background of mib(nn2002) mutants. By comparing the transcriptomic data of mib(nn2002) mutants with those of AB wild-type, a total of 1945 differentially expressed genes were identified, including 685 up- and 1260 down-regulated genes. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified the enriched pathways and their related biological functions. Our data further demonstrated that the defects in the somitogenesis were related to the down-regulated segmentation genes, such as foxc1a, smyhc1, myod1 and mylpfa.

AB TEOSINTE-BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PCF (TCP) proteins are important regulators of growth and developmental processes including branching, floral organ morphogenesis and leaf growth as well as stress response. This study identified 27 TCP genes of Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean), which were divided into three clusters based on phylogenetic relationship. In addition, this study showed that some of TCP genes such as Pvul-TCP-4 and Pvul-TCP-15 located on chromosomes 3 and 7, Pvul-TCP-7 and Pvul-TCP-20 located on chromosome 7 and 9, were segmentally duplicated. On the other hand, a total of 20 Pvul-TCP genes have predicted to be targeted by microRNAs (miRNA). Most of the miRNA-target genes were Pvul-TCP-1,-11,-13 and -27, which were targeted by 13, 17, 22 and 13 plant miRNAs, respectively. miR319 was one of the highly represented regulatory miRNAs to target TCP transcripts. Promoter region analysis of TCP genes resulted that the GT-1 motif, which was related to salt stress, was found in 14 different Pvul-TCP genes. Expression profiling of 10 Pvul-TCP genes based on RNA-sequencing data further confirmed with quantitative real-time RT-PCR measurements identified that Pvul-TCP genes under salt stress are expressed in a cultivar- and tissue-specific manner.

AB With the wide application of RNA-Seq technology, thousands of circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been identified in different type of tissues and cells in many organisms, but little is known on the human aortic valve expressed circRNAs. In this study, we identified all circRNAs in two calcified human aortic valves, and characterized the features of all circRNAs. A total of 5476 circRNAs were identified in human aortic valves, including 1412 (25.79%) aortic valve specific circRNAs. Next, we showed that most aortic valve specific circRNAs were derived from the exonic regions of their host genes, and majority of the host genes contained less than three circRNAs. To predict the potential function of aortic valve specific circRNAs, we performed the GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) enrichment analysis for the host genes, and identified both microRNA (miRNA) and RNA binding protein (RBP) binding sites inside aortic valve specific circRNAs. Results showed that these host genes were involved in some aortic valve related function pathways, such as ECM receptor interaction pathway, ErbB signaling pathway, and vascular smooth muscle contraction pathway. We also found that most aortic valve specific circRNAs harbored abundant miRNA response elements (MREs), and some aortic valve specific circRNAs could bind to RBP of interest. Functional analysis suggested that these aortic valve specific circRNAs could act as post-transcriptional regulators.

AB The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1(MALAT1) has been implicated in breast cancer (BC). Polymorphisms in MALAT1 may play a vital role in the progress of breast cancer by its regulation function. However, potential genetic variants in MALAT1 affecting the development of BC is rarely explored. In our current molecular epidemiology study, all three tagging SNPs (rs3200401, rs619586 and rs7927113) in lncRNA MALATI were selected for genotyping in 487 BCE patients and 489 cancer-free controls in Chinese Han population, and futher experiment of quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR was conducted to examine the relative expression of MALAT1. The results showed that individuals with genotype AG of rs619586 has a decreased risk of BC in codominant model (OR: 0.684, 95%CI: 0.478-0.979), dominant mode (OR: 0.675, 95%CI: 0.479-0.951) and over-dominant model (OR: 0.692, 95%CI: 0484-0.989). Also, qRT-PCR results revealed that the expression for MALATI with AG (0.827 +/- 0.490), GG (0.511 +/- 0.149) and AG + GG genotypes (0.743 +/- 0.447) of rs619586 was significantly lower than that with genotype AA (1.511 +/- 0.737). In addition, females with genotype CT of rs3200401 had a lower risk of BC in the codominant model (OR: 0.75, 95%CI: 0.559-1.007) and over-dominant model (OR: 0.741, 95%CI: 0.552-0.993). In summary, our results implied that the genetic variants of lncRNA MALATI were associated with the susceptibility of BC, and meaningful genetic alteration might affect the corresponding mRNA expression of lncRNA MALAT1.

AB Numerous reports showed low levels of let-7 family in cervical cancer, acting as tumor suppressors by regulating multiple target genes. Genetic variants in the promoter of miRNA have been reported to influence individuals' susceptibility to human diseases. We aimed to investigate the association of rs10877887 and rs13293512 polymorphisms in the promoters of let-7 with risk of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). A total of 331 patients with CSCC and 358 controls were included. Genotyping of rs10877887 was done using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Genotyping of rs13293512 was performed using Taqman allelic discrimination. Relative expression of let-7 family was determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The rs10877887CC genotype was significantly associated with an increased risk of CSCC compared with the rs10877887TT (adjusted OR = 2.11, 95% CI, 1.31-3.40, p-value = 0.002) or rs10877887 TT/CT genotypes (adjusted OR = 2.11, 95% CI, 1.34-3.31, p-value < 0.001). Similarly increased risk of CSCC was observed when compared rs10877887T with rs10877887C allele (adjusted OR = 1.35, 95% CI, 1.08-1.69, p-value = 0.008). Combined analysis showed that individuals carrying the genotypes of rs10877887CC + rs13293512CC had a 4.78-fold higher risk to develop CSCC compared with those carrying the genotypes of rs10877887CT/TT + rs13293512CT/TT (OR = 4.78, 95% CI, 1.78-12.84, p-value = 0.001). Additionally, patients harboring rs10877887CC genotype had a lower level of let-7i in CSCC tissues (p value = 0.02). This observation indicates that rs10877887 may be a useful biomarker for the etiology of CSCC.

AB Natural killer enhancing factor A (NKEF-A), also known as peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1), is a well-known antioxidant involved in innate immunity. Although NKEF-A/Prx1 has been studied in different fish species, the present study broadens the knowledge of NKEF-A gene in terms of molecular structure, function, and immune responses in fish species. Hippocampus abdominalis NKEF-A (HaNKEF-A) cDNA encoded a putative protein of 198 amino acids containing a thioredoxin_2 domain, VCP motifs, and three conserved cysteine residues including peroxidatic and resolving cysteines. Amino acid sequence comparison and phylogenetic breakdown showed the higher sequence identity and closer evolutionary position of HaNKEF-A to those of other fish counterparts. A recombinant protein of HaNKEF-A was shown to i) protect supercoiled DNA against mixed catalyzed oxidation, ii) reduce insulin disulfide bonds, and iii) scavenge extracellular H2O2. Results of in vitro assays demonstrated the concentration dependent antioxidant function of recombinant HaNKEF-A. In addition, qPCR assessments revealed that the HaNKEF-A transcripts were constitutively expressed in fourteen tissues with the highest expression in liver. As an innate immune response, HaNKEF-A transcripts were up-regulated in liver post injection of LPS, Edwardsiella tarda, Streptococcus iniae, and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. Thus, HaNKEF-A can safeguards big-belly seahorse from oxidative damage and pathogenic infections. This study provides insight into the functions of NKEF-A/Prx1 in fish species.

AB Deregulation of microRNA (miRNA) has been suggested as a critical event in colon cancer development and progression. Recent studies have suggested that miR-374b is a novel cancer-related miRNA involved in several cancer types. Thus far, very little is known about the role of miR-374b in colon cancer; therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate the potential role of miR-374b in colon cancer. Here, we showed that miR-374b expression was significantly downregulated in colon cancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-374b inhibited the proliferation and invasion of colon cancer cells, while miR-374b suppression promoted colon cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) was identified as a target of miR-374b in colon cancer cells. Both the mRNA and protein expression of LRH-1 were regulated by miR-374b. In addition, an inverse correlation between LRH-1 mRNA and miR-374b expression was evidenced in colon cancer specimens. Notably, overexpression of miR-374b also downregulated the Wnt signaling in colon cancer cells. Furthermore, restoration of LRH-1 expression significantly abolished the antitumor effect of miR-374b in colon cancer cells. These findings suggest that miR-374b inhibits colon cancer cell proliferation and invasion through downregulation of LRH-1 expression. Inhibiting LRH-1 by miR-374b may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of colon cancer.

AB Pristine forest ecosystems provide a unique perspective for the study of plant-associated microbiota since they host a great microbial diversity. Although the Amazon forest is one of the hotspots of biodiversity around the world, few metagenomic studies described its microbial community diversity thus far. Understanding the environmental factors that can cause shifts in microbial profiles is key to improving soil health and biogeochemical cycles. Here we report a taxonomic and functional characterization of the microbiome from the rhizosphere of Brosimum guianense (Snakewood), a native tree, and bulk soil samples from a pristine Brazilian Amazon forest reserve (Cunia), for the first time by the shotgun approach. We identified several fungi and bacteria taxon significantly enriched in forest rhizosphere compared to bulk soil samples. For archaea, the trend was the opposite, with many archaeal phylum and families being considerably more enriched in bulk soil compared to forest rhizosphere. Several fungal and bacterial decomposers like Postia placenta and Catenulispora acidiphila which help maintain healthy forest ecosystems were found enriched in our samples. Other bacterial species involved in nitrogen (Nitrobacter hamburgensis and Rhodopseudomonas palustris) and carbon cycling (Oligotropha carboxidovorans) were overrepresented in our samples indicating the importance of these metabolic pathways for the Amazon rainforest reserve soil health. Hierarchical clustering based on taxonomic similar microbial profiles grouped the forest rhizosphere samples in a distinct Glade separated from bulk soil samples. Principal coordinate analysis of our samples with publicly available metagenomes from the Amazon region showed grouping into specific rhizosphere and bulk soil clusters, further indicating distinct microbial community profiles. In this work, we reported significant shifts in microbial community structure between forest rhizosphere and bulk soil samples from an Amazon forest reserve that are probably caused by more than one environmental factors such as rhizosphere and soil depth.

AB Mucolipidosis type III gamma (MLIII gamma) is a lysosomal storage disease characterized by joint stiffness, mild coarse face and corneal clouding, which becomes recognizable usually in childhood. Biallelic mutations in the GNPTG gene, which encode the gamma subunit of the N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase enzyme, are the underlying cause of MLIII gamma. The aim of this study is to evaluate the longitudinal findings and genotype of eleven patients from eight families with MLIII gamma and to establish a genotype-phenotype correlation. The most frequently observed initial finding was stiffness of finger joints, which detected in patients between 18 month-olds and five year-olds. However, in four patients presented here, initial finding was knee pain or waddling gait, which started between six-16 years of age. All patients also had variable degrees of stiffness on large joints. The longest follow up period was 16 years while the shortest was three years and six months. We observed that the patients who had an early onset disease and severe joint stiffness had also rapidly progressive joint involvement mostly localized in hands, shoulders, and hip. However; the patients with late onset and/or mild joint stiffness experienced slowly progressive symptoms. Most patients dropped in their growth curve in time and the ones who-were severely affected reached the final height below the third centile. Seven disease causing mutations, three of them novel, were detected in GNPTG gene. According to our clinical observations c.493_494insC and c.283_284insC mutations lead to a severe phenotype and c.196C > T, c.347349del, c.652_655delTACT and c.445delG/c.367A > G mutations seemed to generate a milder phenotype.

AB Autoimmune Thyroid Diseases (AITDs), including Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and Graves' disease (GD), arise by the complex interaction of genes and environmental factors. The aim of present study was to study the susceptible associations of HLA-DRB1* alleles and CTLA4 + 49 AG polymorphism in AITD in south India. AITD patients (n=235; HT=180; GD=55) and age/sex matched healthy controls (n, 235) were enrolled to type HLA-DRB1* alleles and 'CTLA4 + 49 AG' by PCR-SSP and PCR-RFLP methods respectively. Analysis revealed CTLA4 + 49 'GG' genotype was increased significantly in patients (PL: p = 8.7 x 10(-8); HT: p = 9.3 x 10(-6); GD: p = 0.006). Decreased frequencies of 'AA' genotype was observed in patients (PL: p = 9.4 x 10(-6); HT: p = 0.008; GD: p = 9.0 x 10(-6)). Increased frequencies were observed for HLA alleles DRB1*12 (PL: p = 1.42 x 10(-10); HT: p = 5.75 x 10(-8); GD: p = 0.002) and DRB1*11 (PL: p = 0.0025; HT: p = 0.013) in patients. Decreased frequencies for alleles DRB1*10 (PL: p = 0.00002; HT: p = 0.018; GD: p = 1.63 x 10(-5)) and DRB1*03 (PL: p = 0.003; HT: p = 0.003) were observed, suggesting a protective association. Combinatorial/Synergistic analysis have revealed an increased frequencies for 'DRB1*11+AG' (PL: p = 0.022), 'DRB1*12+AG' (PL: p = 6.1 x 10(-5); HT: p = 0.0001), 'DRB1*04+GG' (PL: p = 0.003; HT: p = 0.008), 'DRB1*07+GG' (PL: p = 0.009; HT: p = 0.014) and 'DRB1*12+GG' (PL: p = 0.005; HT: p = 0.005) in patients. However, the combinations such as 'DRB1*10+AA' (PL: p = 1.8 x 10(-6); HT: p = 0.003) and 'DRB1*15+AA' (PL: p = 0.006; GD: p = 0.011) were decreased in patients showing a protective association. The 'GG/G' of CTLA4 + 49AG SNP, HLA-DRB1*11/-DRB1*12 (DR5) alleles and the combinations of DRB1*11/DRB1*12 alleles with AG/GG genotype and DRB1*04/07/12 alleles with GG genotype may act as synergistic manner to confer the strong susceptibility to AITD in south India.

AB Abnormal serum levels of adipokine have been established to be a strong predictor of developing several human diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Association studies have reported several genetic variants in genes coding adipokines with contributions to T2DM susceptibility as well as some glycemic and metabolic traits, of which the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of RETN, NAMPT, and ADIPOQ gene were well documented. However, little is known about contributions of these SNPs to above phenotypes in Chinese. In the current study, with availably quantitative glycemic and metabolic data from a total of 185 T2DM patients and 191 healthy controls, we tested associations between four SNPs of RETN, NAMPT, ADIPOQ gene and 13 glycemic and metabolic traits. The results showed that the rs1862513 and rs34861192 of RETN gene were functional and negatively correlated with the levels of serum creatinine and cholesterol, respectively. The rs16861194 of ADIPOQ gene was positively correlated with the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and AST/alanine aminotransferase level. Moreover, the rs34861192 and rs13237989 of NAMPT gene synergistically affected the levels of insulin and glycemic index. However, due to the limited sample size, only the rs16861194 exerted a significant increased risk on T2DM. These results underscore the contributions of SNPs in RETN, NAMPT, ADIPOQ gene to glycemic and metabolic traits as well as T2DM susceptibility in Chinese.

AB R-spondin 1 (Rspo1) is a potential female-determining gene in mammals that could regulate the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The deletion of Rspo1 causes sex reversal in females. To investigate sexual determination and differentiation, we cloned and analyzed the Rspo1 gene in Cynoglossus semilaevis. Phylogenetic and gene structure analyses revealed that Rspo1 gene exhibited high sequence conservation and contained an N-terminal signal peptide, two furin-like cysteine-rich domains (FU1 and FU2), a thrombospondin type 1 repeat, and a C-terminal region enriched with basic charged amino acids. qRT-PCR revealed that Rspo1 expressed sexual dimorphism in gonad, with higher expression levels in the ovary than in the testis, thus, suggesting the involvement of Rspo1 in gonad differentiation. In situ hybridization results demonstrated that Rspo1 was expressed in premature germ cells, including spermatogonia and spermatocytes in the testis and stage II and stage III oocytes in the ovary. The methylation levels in two CpG sites of Rspo1 promoter significantly differed among females, males, and pseudomales. After 30 days of exposure to high temperature, the expression of Rspo1 significantly decreased in female individuals, some of which were prone to males. However, no difference of Rspo1 gene expression was observed between the control group and high-temperature group in males. These preliminary findings suggested that Rspo1 played a crucial role in sex determination and development. This study laid the groundwork for further sex control breeding techniques in C. semilaevis.

AB Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Metastasis remains a major challenge for the clinical management and prognosis of patients with cancer. The metalloprotease MMP-9 plays a critical role in the first step of metastasis through extracellular matrix degradation. In this study, our goal was to determine the effect of epigenetic mechanisms in the promoter and intragenic region of this gene and to correlate it to the levels of expression of MMP9 in breast cancer cell lines. We have identified that MMP9 was highly expressed in the breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-436 after 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-azadC) treatment. Sequencing of the promoter region as well as the CGI intronic CpG islands showed a specific sequence in CGI2, between CpGs 12-30 that was demethylated after 5-azadC treatment. This specific region was studied in breast cancer samples that revealed similar results with demethylation in positive MMP-9 breast cancer samples. Furthermore, the histone methylation marker of open chromatin (H3K4me3) was found in the promoter and intronic regions of MMP9 after 5-azadC treatment. Taken together these results showed a mechanism of DNA methylation and gene expression regulation by epigenetic marks present in the intronic DNA region of MMP9.

AB The aim of the study was to investigate the role of adiponectin and 5 variants of its gene in the risk of premature myocardial infarction (MI).
   The studied group (MI < 50) consisted of 158 young patients (125 men) aged < 50 with MI. The control groups consisted of 155 healthy people (97 men), aged < 50 and 202 patients (130 men) aged 50 with MI (MI >= 50).
   There were statistically significant differences between MI < 50 patients and healthy control group in the prevalence of rs17300539:G > A (AA genotype: 19.3% vs. 0%, p < 0.0001) and rs72563731:C > T variants (CC genotype: 81.5% vs. 15.9%, p < 0.0001) and between MI < 50 and MI >= 50 patients in variants: rs17300539:G > A (AA genotype: 19.3% vs. 0.5%, p < 0.0001), rs72563731:C > T (CC genotype: 82.1% vs. 60.8%, p < 0.0001), rs1501299:G > T (TT genotype: 6.8% vs. 14.9%, p = 0.019) and rs822387:T > C (genotype CC: 1.5% vs. 0%, p = 0.017). Multivariate analysis showed a significantly higher risk of MI in young CC carriers of rs72563731:C > T and in young AA carriers of rs17300539:G > A. Total and HMW adiponectin plasma levels have been significantly lower in MI < 50 patients in comparison to MI >= 50 patients (p = 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively) and to healthy subjects (p = 0.009 and p = 0.01, respectively).
   Our study indicates the possible role of adiponectin and its genetic variants in MI in young age.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the association of interleukin (IL)-10 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a Chinese population. 848 SLE patients and 461 normal controls were recruited in this study. Nine SNPs in IL-10 gene (rs1518110, rs1518111, rs1554286, rs1800890, rs1800893, rs3024493, rs3024495, rs3024498 and rs6667202) were genotyped using TaqMan genotyping assays on Fluidigm 192.24 system. The frequency of IL-10 rs3024498-C allele was significantly higher in patient group compared with control subjects (OR = 5.118, 95% CI = 1.819-14.405, P = 0.002). No significant differences were detected for the distribution of allele and genotype frequencies of other eight SNPs between patients with SLE and controls after Bonferroni correction (all P > 0.0056). Interestingly, significant differences were detected both in the allele and genotype frequencies of rs3024498 between SLE patients with and without arthritis (P = 0.002, P = 0.022, respectively). There was significant difference in genotype frequency at rs3024498 between SLE patients with and without malar rash (P = 0.040). And, there was significant difference in allele frequency at rs3024498 between SLE patients with and without anti-double-stranded DNA (P = 0.032). Meanwhile, significant difference in genotype frequency at rs1518110 and rs1518111 were found in patients with and without lupus headache (P = 0.025, P = 0.038, respectively). There were significant difference in allele and genotype frequency at rs1800890 and rs6667202 between SLE patients with and without thrombocytopenia (rs1800890: P = 0.016, P = 0.026, respectively; rs6667202: P = 0.007, P = 0.007, respectively). Further, significant difference were observed both in allele frequency and in genotype distribution of rs1800893 between patients with and without tubular urine and proteinuria (tubular urine: P < 0.001, P = 0.003, respectively; proteinuria: P = 0.001, P = 0.018, respectively). In summary, IL-10 rs3024498 polymorphism might contribute to SLE susceptibility and several clinical phenotypes.

TI Food effects in paediatric medicines development for products
   Co-administered with food
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS

ID DRUG; CHILDREN; PHARMACOKINETICS; METABOLISM; MECHANISMS
AB A small amount of food is commonly used to aid administration of medicines to children to improve palatability and/or swallowability. However the impact of this co-administered food on the absorption and subsequent pharmacokinetic profile of the drug is unknown. Existing information on food effects is limited to standard protocols used to evaluate the impact of a high fat meal in an adult population using the adult medication. In the absence of a substantial body of data, there are no specific guidelines available during development of paediatric products relating to low volumes of potentially low calorie food.
   This paper brings together expertise to consider how the impact of co-administered food can be risk assessed during the development of a paediatric medicine. Two case studies were used to facilitate discussions and seek out commonalities in risk assessing paediatric products; these case studies used model drugs that differed in their solubility, a poorly soluble drug that demonstrated a positive food effect in adults and a highly soluble drug where a negative food effect was observed. For poorly soluble drugs risk assessments are centred upon understanding the impact of food on the in vivo solubility of the drug which requires knowledge of the composition of the food and the volumes present within the paediatric gastrointestinal tract. Further work is required to develop age appropriate in vitro and in silico models that are representative of paediatric populations.
   For soluble drugs it is more important to understand the mechanisms that may lead to a food effect, this may include interactions with transporters or the impact of the food composition on gastro-intestinal transit or even altered gastric motility. In silico models have the most promise for highly soluble drug products although it is essential that these models reflect the relevant mechanisms involved in potential food effects.
   The development of appropriate in vitro and in silico tools is limited by the lack of available clinical data that is critical to validate any tool. Further work is required to identify globally acceptable and available vehicles that should be the first option for co-administration with medicines to enable rapid and relevant risk assessment.

AB The selection and design of age-appropriate formulations intended for use in paediatric and geriatric patients are dependent on multiple factors affecting patient acceptability, safety and access. The development of an economic and effective product relies on a balanced consideration of the risks and benefits of these factors. This review provides a comprehensive and up-to-date analysis of oral dosage forms considering key aspects of formulation design including dosage considerations, ease of use, tolerability and safety, manufacturing complexity, stability, supply and cost. Patient acceptability has been examined utilising an evidence-based approach to evaluate regulatory guidance and literature. Safety considerations including excipients and potential risk of administration errors of the different dosage forms are also discussed, together with possible manufacturing and supply challenges. Age appropriate drug product design should consider and compare i) acceptability ii) safety and iii) access, although it is important to recognise that these factors must be balanced against each other, and in some situations a compromise may need to be reached when selecting an age-appropriate formulation.

AB The acceptability of pediatric pharmaceutical products to patients and their caregivers can have a profound impact on the resulting therapeutic outcome. However, existing methodology and approaches used for acceptability assessments for pediatric products is fragmented, making robust and consistent product evaluations difficult. A pediatric formulation development workshop took place in Washington, DC in June 2016 through the University of Maryland's Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (M-CERSI). A session at the workshop was dedicated to acceptability assessments and focused on two major elements that affect the overall acceptability of oral medicines, namely swallowability and palatability. The session started with presentations to provide an overview of literature, background and current state on swallowability and palatability assessments. Five parallel breakout discussions followed the presentations on each element, focusing on three overarching themes, risk-based approaches, methodology and product factors. This article reports the key outcomes of the workshop related to swallowability and palatability assessments.

AB Bitter taste is innately aversive and thought to protect against consuming poisons. Bitter taste receptors (Tas2Rs) are G-protein coupled receptors, expressed both orally and extra-orally and proposed as novel targets for several indications, including asthma. Many clinical drugs elicit bitter taste, suggesting the possibility of drugs re-purposing. On the other hand, the bitter taste of medicine presents a major compliance problem for pediatric drugs. Thus, efficient tools for predicting, measuring and masking bitterness of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are required by the pharmaceutical industry. Here we highlight the BitterDB database of bitter compounds and survey the main computational approaches to prediction of bitter taste based on compound's chemical structure. Current in silico bitterness prediction methods provide encouraging results, can be constantly improved using growing experimental data, and present a reliable and efficient addition to the APIs development toolbox.

AB Hot melt extrusion has gained considerable attention as a novel technique for taste masking of bitter APIs. The aim of this study was to investigate whether hot melt extrusion could be used to develop taste masked formulations of isoniazid and also to evaluate and correlate different taste assessment methods Two polymers with different physico-chemical properties, Soluplus and Eudragit E-PO were chosen as carriers for the drug. Eudragit E-PO has already been widely used for taste masking due to its selective release properties, while Soluplus has not been studied in this regard but provides a useful comparator of a polymer that should release the drug reasonably efficiently. Polymeric formulations of isoniazid were produced with drug loadings of 20% and 30% w/w. The solid state characteristics of the formulations were assessed by differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction. The taste of isoniazid was assessed using the rodent Brief Access Taste Aversion (BATA) model, while formulations were assessed using the electronic tongue and dissolution under simulated oral conditions. Investigation into the drug loading effect with these two polymers showed that all Soluplus based extrudates with drug loading up to 30% w/w were fully amorphous while Eudragit E-PO based extrudates contained crystalline drug as demonstrated by both DSC and PXRD, dependent on loading. BATA testing of isoniazid gave an IC50 value, i.e. the dose of drug which inhibits 50% of licks, of 11.1 mg/mL. Taste assessment of the formulations using both simulated oral drug release and the electronic tongue demonstrated that Eudragit E-PO based formulations had a better taste masking efficiency than Soluplus. This is due to the fact that significantly less isoniazid is released from the Eudragit E-PO based formulations under oral conditions. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID STEP SAFETY; TOXICITY; MEDICINES; DATABASE
AB A public workshop entitled "Challenges and strategies to facilitate formulation development of pediatric drug products" focused on current status and gaps as well as recommendations for risk-based strategies to support the development of pediatric age-appropriate drug products. Representatives from industry, academia, and regulatory agencies discussed the issues within plenary, panel, and case-study breakout sessions. By enabling practical and meaningful discussion between scientists representing the diversity of involved disciplines (formulators, nonclinical scientists, clinicians, and regulators) and geographies (eg, US, EU), the Excipients Safety workshop session was successful in providing specific and key recommendations for defining paths forward. Leveraging orthogonal sources of data (eg. food industry, agro science), collaborative data sharing, and increased awareness of the existing sources such as the Safety and Toxicity of Excipients for Paediatrics (STEP) database will be important to address the gap in excipients knowledge needed for risk assessment. The importance of defining risk-based approaches to safety assessments for excipients vital to pediatric formulations was emphasized, as was the need for meaningful stakeholder (eg, patient, caregiver) engagement.

ID PHARMACOKINETICS; TUBERCULOSIS; TABLETS
AB Objectives: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends flexible solid oral dosage forms such as dispersible tablet as the preferred formulation for (young) children, especially in developing/low-and middle-income countries, LMIC. The aim of this study was to assess experience, perceptions of acceptability, and formulation preferences, among 10 oral dosage forms for young children in a sample of end-users in Nigeria as an exemplar LMIC.
   Methods: Using a semi-structured and validated questionnaire, 148 caregivers were surveyed. Acceptability was assessed by level of liking using a 3-point Likert scale and ease of administration. Preference was assessed from participants' dosage form of choice. Oral dosage forms assessed were those mentioned in the British National Formulary for children, 2013.
   Results: The formulation perceived as the most acceptable was the chewable/suckable tablet. However, preference was for liquids. Specifically with the dispersible tablet, whilst 89% (n = 111) of caregivers of young children found it easy-to-administer, only 50% of children liked it.
   Conclusion: There is a gap between the proposal of dispersible tablet as the preferred dosage form for young children and caregivers' perceptions of acceptability and preference. Educational strategies to increase acceptability of dispersible tablets as the preferred formulation for young children would be required.

AB The transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a highly Ca2+-permeable non-selective cation channel in TRPV family. Accumulating evidence hints that TRPV4 play a significant role in a wide diversity of pathologic changes. Fibrosis is a kind of chronic disease which was characterized by the formation of excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components in tissues and organs. In recent years, a growing body of studies showed that TRPV4 acted as a crucial regulator in the progression of fibrosis including myocardial fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis and pancreatic fibrosis, suggesting TRPV4 may be a potential therapeutic vehicle in fibrotic diseases. However, the mechanisms by which TRPV4 regulates fibrosis are still undefined. In this review, firstly, we intend to sum up the collective knowledge of TRPV4. Then we provided the latent mechanism between TRPV4 and fibrosis. We also elaborated the distinct signaling pathways focus on TRPV4 with fibrosis. Finally, we discussed its potential as a novel therapeutic target for fibrosis.

AB Rapid cold hardening (RCH) is a central physiological adaptation in which brief chilling significantly enhances the cold tolerance ability of insects. However, the mechanism of rapid cold stress response remains unknown for rice water weevils. To elucidate the mechanism, a comparative proteomic analysis was applied with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) between RCH and control treatment samples. A total of 21 protein spots were found to be up-regulated in rice water weevil adults for the RCH condition. As an initial work, 16 of these proteins were identified using MALDI TOF/TOF MS. In addition, the expression patterns of 9 proteins (including 2 HSPs that were not identified in the 2-DE experiment) were confirmed by qPCR analysis. Using the geneMANIA app in cytoscape, we constructed a protein-protein interaction network analysis of these up-regulated proteins. Gene ontology (GO) function annotation shows that a "response to heat process," including 6 HSPs, was related to the identified proteins. These up-regulated, RCH responsive proteins could possibly serve as potential biomarkers to study the molecular mechanisms of the L. oryzophilus response to cold stress.

AB Each gene of the tubby-like family is characterized by a signature of C-terminal tubby domain. The wide spread of this family in plants and animals implies they have an important function in various organisms. Even though the tubby-like genes are suggested to be putative transcription factors (TFs), how they execute the function as TFs is not yet clear. The biological functions of most animal tubby-like genes have been well studied, especially for vertebrate TUB, TULP1 and TULP3, but not with TULP2 and TULP4. Plants possess more tubby-like genes than animals, but their functions are still elusive except the idea that they are involved in stress responses with indistinct mechanisms. Here we reviewed the current knowledge of the versatile functions and roles of the tubby like family members in plants and animals.

AB Epidemiogical evidence has shown that the incidence of atrial fibrillation in tumor patients is higher than non tumor patients and general population. The potential risk factors predisposing tumor patients to atrial fibrillation include advanced age, comorbidities, direct anatomic local occupying effect of tumors in the heart or adjacent organs, paraneoplastic manifestations of some tumors, tumor-induced dys-regulation of metabolism, radio-, bio- and chemo-therapeutics, disturbance of autonomous nerve system because of physical pain and psychological sufferings, chronic inflammation typical of most tumors, and surgical interventions among others. However, whether tumor suppressor genes commonly mutated or dys-regulated in tumor play any roles in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation remain largely unexplored. Tumor suppressor genes or genes possessing tumor suppressing function have been reported to be constitutively expressed in quiescent heart, and mutations, small nucleotide polymorphisms, or disturbed expression of tumor suppressor genes has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation. Here, we provide a state-of-the-art overview of the unrecognized roles of tumor suppressor genes in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation, focusing mainly on the two well-characterized tumor suppressor genes, zinc finger homeobox protein-3 and esophageal cancer related gene-4.

AB In ovarian follicle development, estrogen acts as a regulatory molecule to mediate proliferation and differentiation of follicular cells. ER alpha (estrogen receptor alpha) exerts regulatory function classically by binding directly to the estrogen response element, recruiting co-factors and activating or repressing transcription in response to E2. In this study, we used ChIP-seq to map ER alpha-binding sites in ovaries of Hy-line Brown commercial hens at 45 d, 90 d and 160 d. In total, 24,886, 21,680 and 23,348 binding sites were identified in the ovaries of hens at 45 d, 90 d and 160 d, which are linked to 86, 83 and 74 genes, respectively. The PPI network contains 47 protein nodes and 164 interaction edges, among which, AKT1 (V-Akt Murine Thymoma Viral Oncogene Homolog 1) and ACTN2 (Actinin Alpha 2) with the highest weight in the network, followed by CREB1 (CAMP Responsive Element Binding Protein 1), and EPHA5 (EPH Receptor A5) were identified. These genes are likely related to sexual maturity in hens. This study also provides insight into the regulation of the ER alpha target gene networks and a reference for understanding ER alpha-regulated transcription.

AB Purpose: To investigate the expression, clinical significance, biological function, and the potential mechanism of PHGDH in pancreatic cancer.
   Methods: The expression of PHGDH in human pancreatic cancer tissues and corresponding adjacent normal tissues were analyzed through immunohistochemistry staining. Simultaneously, the association between the PHGDH expression and the clinicopathological parameters and OS and DFS was evaluated. Human pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC-3 and SW1990 were selected to investigate the effect of PHGDH knockdown on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In addition, we performed western blot to assess the expression of cyclin and cyclin D1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 protein.
   Results: Our results suggested that the expression of PHGDH is increased in pancreatic cancer compared with adjacent normal tissues and the increased expression of PHGDH is associated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and TNM state of pancreatic cancer patients. Moreover, the expression of PHGDH is an independent prognostic indicator for pancreatic cancer patients. In addition, we found that knockdown of PHGDH in pancreatic cancer cells inhibits the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities by down-regulating the expression of cyclin B1, and cyclin Dl, MMP-2, and MMP-9.
   Conclusions: Our data indicated that the expression of PHGDH is increased in pancreatic cancer and is an independent molecular prognostic factor for pancreatic cancer patients. In addition, PHGDH controls cell proliferation, migration and invasion abilities. Therefore, PHGDH could serve as an important prognostic indicator and therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.

AB Preterm birth (PTB) is featured by less than 37 weeks of gestational age or fewer than 259 days since the first day from the last menstrual period. Complications of PTB are the major cause of neonatal deaths, several factors are linked to PTB increased risk including immunological and genetics. Vitamin D plays an important role in immune response modulation and its action occurs through the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which recently has been described as overexpressed in human placenta during the pregnancy. Herein we assessed two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) FokI (rs2228570 A > G) and Cdx-2 (rs11568820 T > C), within VDR, using TaqMan fluorogenic probes, and differential susceptibility to SPTB. We assessed 104 pregnant women with SPTB and 85 women with normal birth in a Northeastern Brazilian population. Statistically significant differences for both SNPs where found when comparing allele and genotype frequencies in both groups: the T allele for rs2228570 and A allele for rs11568820 were significantly more frequent in SPTB group than in normal birth group (p = 0.000013 and p = 0.00466, respectively). The rs11568820 A/A genotype was associated to clinical/demographic variables such as: premature birth (p = 0.007), neonate weight (p = 0.039), presence of infection during pregnancy (p = 0.011) and premature birth among multiparous (p = 0.015). The rs2228570 T/T genotype associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (p = 0.044) and chorioamnionitis during pregnancy (p = 0.043). In conclusion our findings indicate an association between polymorphisms Fokl and Cdx-2 within VDR gene and SPTB, suggesting their involvement in the triggering of these syndromes.

TI Protein secondary structure prediction based on the fuzzy support vector
   machine with the hyperplane optimization
SO GENE

DT Article
ID SIMILARITY; PROFILES; SVM
AB The prediction of the protein secondary structure is a crucial point in bioinformatics and related fields. In the last years, machine learning methods have become a valuable tool, achieving satisfactory results. However, the prediction accuracy needs to be further ameliorated. This paper proposes a new method based on an improved fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) for the prediction of the secondary structure of proteins. Unlike traditional methods to set the membership function, it firstly constructs an approximate optimal separating hyperplane by iterating the class centers in the feature space. Then sample points close to this hyperplane are assigned with large membership values, while outliers with small membership values according to the K-nearest neighbor. And some sample points with low membership values are removed, reducing the training time and improving the prediction accuracy. To optimize the prediction results, our method also exploits information on sequence-based structural similarity. We used three databases (e.g. RS126, CB513 and data1199) to test this method, showing the achievement of 94.2%, 93.1%, 96.7% Q3 accuracy and 91.7%, 89.7%, 94.1% SOV values for the three datasets, respectively. Overall, our method results are comparable to or often better than commonly used methods (Magnan & Baldi, 2014; Sheng et al., 2016) for secondary structure prediction.

AB Computational analysis of biomolecular interaction networks is now gaining a lot of importance to understand the functions of novel genes/proteins. Gene interaction (GI) network analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis play a major role in predicting the functionality of interacting genes or proteins and gives an insight into the functional relationships and evolutionary conservation of interactions among the genes. An interaction network is a graphical representation of gene/protein interactome, where each gene/protein is a node, and interaction between gene/protein is an edge. In this review, we discuss the popular open source databases that serve as data repositories to search and collect protein/gene interaction data, and also tools available for the generation of interaction network, visualization and network analysis. Also, various network analysis approaches like topological approach and clustering approach to study the network properties and functional enrichment server which illustrates the functions and pathway of the genes and proteins has been discussed. Hence the distinctive attribute mentioned in this review is not only to provide an overview of tools and web servers for gene and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis but also to extract useful and meaningful information from the interaction networks.

ID RNA HELICASE; MUTATIONS
AB Oncogenes EGFR and ras are frequently mutated and activated in human lung cancers. In this report, we found that both EGFR and Ras signaling can upregulate RNA helicase DDX59 in lung cancer cells. DDX59 can be induced through the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway after EGFR or Ras activation. Inhibitors for Ras/Raf/MAP pathway significantly decreased DDX59 expression at both protein and mRNA levels. Through immunohistochemistry, we found that DDX59 protein expression correlated with Ras and EGFR mutation status in human lung adenocarcinoma. Finally, through a xenograft nude mice model, we demonstrated that DDX59 is pivotal for EGFR mutated lung cancer cell growth in vivo. Our study identified a novel protein downstream of Ras and EGFR, which may serve as a potential therapeutic drug target for lung cancer patients.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important short endogenous non-coding RNAs that have critical biological roles by acting as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Chromosomal region 9q22.32 encodes the miR-23b/27b/24-1 cluster and produces miR-23b, which is a pleiotropic modulator in many developmental processes and pathological conditions. Expression of miR-23b is actively suppressed and induced in response to many different stimuli. We discuss the biological functions and transcriptional regulation of this multifaceted miRNA in different tumor types, during development, upon viral infection, as well as in various clinical disorders, immune responses, as well as cardiovascular and thyroid functions. The combined body of work suggests that miR-23b expression is modulated by a diverse array of stimuli in cells from different lineages and participates in multiple gene regulatory feedback loops. Elevation of miR-23b levels appears to instruct cells to limit their proliferative and migratory potential, while promoting the acquisition of specialized phenotypes or protection from invading viruses and parasites. In contrast, loss of miR-23b can deregulate normal tissue homeostasis by removing constraints on cell cycle progression and cell motility. Collectively, the findings on miR-23b indicate that it is a very potent post-transcriptional regulator of growth and differentiation during development, multiple cancers and other biological processes. Understanding the regulation and activity of miR-23b has significant diagnostic value in many biological disorders and may identify cellular pathways that are amenable to therapeutic intervention.

AB Background: Brachydactyly type A2 (BDA2) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by the deformation of the middle phalanx of the second fingers and toes. It has been reported to be associated with three genes regulating the osteogenesis, including BMPRIB, GDF5 and BMP2.
   Materials and methods: 10 BDA2 patients and 7 unaffected individuals in a Chinese family were identified through clinical signs and radiographs. The mutation analyses of BMPRIB, GDF5 and BMP2 gene was performed in all the available family members and 100 control subjects. The duplication analysis for the downstream of BMP2 was also performed in all the samples.
   Results: A novel 4671 bp duplication downstream the BMP2 gene was identified in all the patients undergoing molecular analysis but not in the unaffected individuals and healthy controls, with a 28 bp microhomology flanking it. There was no mutation in all the exons of BMPRIB, GDF5 and BMP2 in all the tested family members.
   Conclusion: The novel duplication has different breakpoints compared with the previous ones but highly overlapped with them. The duplication narrows the range of the potential cis-regulatory sequence, and further supports the association between BDA2 and the duplication downstream BMP2.

AB Intermuscular bones (IBs) only exist in the myosepta of lower teleosts and its molecular mechanism remains to be clarified. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have been demonstrated to be involved in various physiological processes, including bone and cartilage formation. In this study, we firstly obtained and characterized nine bmp genes for Megalobrama amblycephala, which belongs to Cyprinidae and have a certain amount of IBs. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis both documented that the mature proteins of M. amblycephala bmp genes were highly conserved with other corresponding homologs, respectively, indicating that the function of each bmp gene has been conserved throughout evolution. As a step to characterize potential involvement of bmp genes in IB formation and development, spatiotemporal expressions of nine bmp genes (bmp2a, bmp2b, bmp3, bmp4, bmp5, bmp7b, bmp8a, bmpl 4 and bmp16) were investigated during the key development stages of IBs. During the ossification process from stage I (the IBs haven't emerged) to stage IV (all of the IBs ossified in the tail with the mature morphology), the expression profiles revealed that bmpl 6 was the most abundant transcript while bmp4 had the lowest abundance. The mRNA levels of bmp3, bmp4, bmp5 and bmp8a increased significantly at stage II, suggesting their roles in stimulating IB formation. The expression of bmp7b reached the highest level at stage III (the rapid period of IB development), suggesting potential involvement of bmp7b in promoting osteoblast differentiation. With the exception of bmp7b and bmp16, most bmp genes appeared a significant increase at IB maturation phase (stage IV), which means that they may play important roles in maintenance of IB morphogenesis. Spatial tissue distribution of bmp genes showed that most bmp genes were observed at the highest level in developing IBs at one year old fish. Spatiotemporal expression patterns suggest the potential key roles of these bmp genes in IBs formation and maintenance in fish, being as possible promoters or inhibitors.

AB Background: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a novel class of noncoding RNAs that are involved in a variety of biological processes and human diseases. Recent evidence suggested that lncRNAs were associated with cardiac disorders. However, the roles of lncRNAs in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) remain elusive. The purpose of the present study was to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs in PAF and predict their potential functions.
   Methods: Between May 2014 and December 2015, a total of 67 patients, including 34 patients with PAF and 33 patients without PAF were recruited in this study. Of these participants, 3 PAF patients and 3 controls were used for the microarray analysis and a separate cohort (31 PAF patients and 30 controls) were used for further validation. LncRNA profiles in the leukocytes were detected by microarray.
   Results: A total of 2095 and 1584 differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs, respectively, were identified between the PAF patients and controls. Four lncRNAs (uc002nvy.3, ENST00000561094, uc004aef.3, ENST00000559960) were randomly selected for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in a separate cohort, validating that ENST00000559960 was upregulated and uc004aef.3 was downregulated in the PAF patients. uc002nvy.3 and ENST00000561094 showed no significant difference between PAF and the controls. Multiple logistic analyses showed that ENST00000559960 (OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.00; P = 0.01) and uc004aef.3 (OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.96; P = 0.03) were independently associated with PAF. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analyses revealed that ENST00000559960 and uc004aef.3 were modest predictors of PAF. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.67 +/- 0.07 (95% CI 0.54-0.81; P = 0.02) for uc004aef.3 and 0.70 +/- 0.07 (95% CI 0.56-0.83; P < 0.01) for ENST00000559960. Bioinformatic analyses (lncRNAs classification and subgroup, gene ontology analysis, pathway analysis and gene co-expression network construction) were performed for predicting the role of IncRNAs.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that lncRNA profiles were differentially expressed in the PAF leukocytes, and two lncRNAs (ENST00000559960 and uc004aef.3) may help in prediction of PAF. This motivates further investigation of the role of lncRNAs for PAF.

AB The lack of effective medical treatment for advanced stages of gastric cancer mainly contributes to the high mortality rate. The association of forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) with tumor progression has been reported in different human cancers. However, the function of FOXA1 in gastric cancer is largely unknown. In the present study, FOXA1 protein showed a significant reduction in gastric cancer samples comparing with matched control samples. In addition, the higher expression of FOXA1 in transcription level was observed in gastric cancer cell lines as compared with that in normal gastric cell line, while the contrary result was observed in protein level. Then we studied the effects of FOXA1 on gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo based on FOXA1-overexpression AGS cells. We found that up-regulation of FOXA1 was notably inhibited the cell proliferation and tumor formation, and induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, overexpression of FOXA1 was able to increase the E-cadherin protein level and decreased the Vimentin protein level, which implicates that FOXA1 probably plays as an inhibitor of epithelial mesenchymal transition. In conclusion, these data suggests that FOXA1 may function as a novel anti-oncogene in gastric cancer cells.

AB Background: The altered expression of circulating miRNAs has been discovered in many autoimmune diseases (ADs). With rare existing research, it is still unclear in Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). We detected plasma miRNA expression of HT patients in this three-stage designed study.
   Methods: Differently expressed miRNAs (4 HT pools vs. 1 normal control pool) were identified using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) based Exiqon panel (miRCURY-Ready-to-Use- PCR-Human-panel-I + II-V1.M) in the initial discovery stage. These miRNAs were then confirmed in the training stage and further validated in the testing stage using qRT-PCR with 64 (32 HT vs. 32 NCs) and 136 samples (68 HT vs. 68 NCs), respectively.
   Results: A total of 10 miRNAs showed differential expression through the training stage. For further validation in the testing stage, expression of 6 miRNAs (miR-205, miR-20a-3p, miR-375, miR-296, miR-451, miR-500a) were consistent with those in the training stage. Combination results showed that these 6 miRNAs were significantly up-regulated in peripheral plasma of HT patients compared with normal controls (P < 0.05). In addition, the six-miRNA signature was evaluated to be a potential diagnostic marker of HT. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the signature were 0.80, 0.75 and 0.69 for the training, testing and the combined stages, respectively. Three miRNAs were associated with TSH levels in HT patients (miR-451, P = 0.043; naR-375, P = 0.043; miR-500a, P = 0.043). Additionally, miR-20a-3p was related with TgAb level (P = 0.046).
   Conclusions: We identified a miRNA signature including six dysregulated plasma miRNAs which could act as a diagnostic marker in plasma of HT, providing more evidence and better understanding for the association between circulating miRNAs and autoimmune diseases.

AB Dilated cardiomyopathy arises from mutations in many genes. TTN, the gene encoding the sarcomere protein titin, has been insufficiently analyzed for cardiomyopathy mutations because of its enormous size. In this study, we report a Chinese family with two members affected by TIN. Blood samples were collected from all family members. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood, and all coding exons and adjacent intronic sequences of the TTN gene were examined for mutation analysis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based sequencing. The proband (III3) and his sister (III2) carry a TTN c.100126A > G (p.Thr33376A1a) missense mutation. The pro band currently exhibits decreased cardiac function accompanied by malignant arrhythmia, and his sister has no obvious clinical symptoms and no abnormal ultrasound findings. The study found that there is a missense mutation in the TIN gene, c.100126A > G (p.Thr33376A1a), in a family whose members suffer from familial dilated cardiomyopathy in Hubei province. TTN is closely related to dilated cardiomyopathy and is an important causative gene of familial dilated cardiomyopathy.

AB MADS-box proteins have been implicated in many biological processes. However, plant MADS-box proteins functioning in floral organ abscission and the underlying physiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of PsJOINTLESS isolated from 'Kuerlexiangli'. PsJOINTLESS had a complete open reading frame of 672 bp, encoding a 224 amino acid peptide, and shared high sequence identities with MADS-box from other plants. PsJOINTLESS was subcellularly targeted to the nucleus, supporting its role as a transcription factor. Expression levels of PsJOINTLESS in the calyx tube were strongly induced by calyx abscission treatment at 6 d after full bloom. Overexpression of PsJOINTLESS in tomato enhanced the rate of pedicel abscission rate. Of special note, the transgenic plants increased the abscission zone cell layer compared with wild type. Furthermore, the tomato transgenic lines showed thinner flower pedicels, more cell number and small pedicel cell size. The cellulase activity in pedicel abscission zone of transgenic plants was higher than that of wild type. In addition, steady-state mRNA levels of five cell wall hydrolase genes coding for either functional or regulatory proteins were induced to higher levels in the transgenic lines. These results clearly demonstrate that PsJOINTLESS may affect pedicel abscission zone development.

AB Erythrocyte count and volume are the commonly used hematological indices for anemia that change in various diseases. To date, however, only one study ever exists that addressed erythrocyte trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a Japanese population. Because that study was performed in patients with various disesases, we confirmed the reported associations in a general population. Participants in the current study were from the Shizuoka component of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study, which included 4971 men and women aged 35 to 69 years who were recruited between 2006 and 2007. We analyzed the association of seven selected SNPs with the following erythrocyte traits: red blood cell count, hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Ht) levels, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. The erythrocyte traits were regressed on a number of minor alleles of selected SNPs. Then we compared our findings with those from a genome-wide association study performed in a Japanese population. We replicated the association of ABO rs495828, PDGFRA-KIT rs218237, USP49-MED2O-BSYL-CCND3 rs3218097, C6orf182-CD164 rs11966072, TERT rs2736100, and TMPRSS6 rs5756504 with erythrocyte traits in our independent Japanese population.

AB Lipid metabolism forms the heart and soul of Mycobacterium tuberculosis life cycle. Starting from macrophage invasion at cholesterol rich micro-domains to a sustainable survival for infection by utilizing cholesterol, Mycobacterium displays the nexus of metabolic pathways around host derived lipids. mce4 operon acts as cholesterol import system in M. tuberculosis and here we demonstrate role of mce4A gene of this operon in cholesterol catabolism. Here M. tuberculosis H37Rv overexpressing Rv3499c (mce4A) recombinant was used as a model to decipher the metabolic flux during intake and utilization of host lipids by mycobacteria. We analysed the impact of mce4A expression on carbon shift initiated during cholesterol utilization necessary for long term survival of mycobacterium. Through transcriptional analysis, upregulation in methylcitrate cycle (MCC) and methylmalonyl pathway (MMP) genes was observed in Rv3499c overexpressing recombinants of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Up-regulation of methylmalonyl pathway associated enzyme encoding genes increased accumulation of virulence associated mycobacterial lipids phthiocerol dimycocerates (PDIM) and sulfolipid (SL1). We demonstrate that MCC and MMP associated enzyme encoding genes are upregulated upon mce4A overexpression and lead to enhanced accumulation of PDIM and SL1 which are responsible for pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis.

TI Evaluating different DNA binding domains to modulate L1 ORF2p-driven

AB DNA binding domains (DBDs) have been used with great success to impart targeting capabilities to a variety of proteins creating highly useful genomic tools. We evaluated the ability of five types of DBDs and strategies (AAV Rep proteins, Cre, TAL effectors, zinc finger proteins, and Cas9/gRNA system) to target the L1 ORF2 protein to drive retrotransposition of Mu inserts to specific sequences in the human genome. First, we find that the L1 ORF2 protein tolerates the addition of protein domains both at the amino- and carboxy-terminus. Although in some instances retrotransposition efficiencies slightly diminished, all fusion proteins containing an intact ORF2 were capable of driving retrotransposition. Second, the stability of individual ORF2 fusion proteins varies and difficult to predict. Third, DBDs that require the formation of multimers for target recognition are unlikely to modify targeting of ORF2p-driven insertions. Fourth, the more components needed to assemble into a complex to drive targeted retrotransposition, the less likely the strategy will increase targeted insertions. Fifth, abundance of target sequences present in the genome will likely dictate the effectiveness and efficiency of targeted insertions. Lastly, the cleavage capabilities of Cas9 (or a Cas9 nickase variant) are unable to substitute for the L1 ORF2 endonuclease domain functions, suggestive that the endonuclease domain has alternate functions needed for retrotransposition. From these studies, we conclude that the most critical component for the modification of the human L1 ORF2 protein to drive targeted insertions is the selection of the DBD due to the varying functional requirements and impacts on protein stability.

AB The core circadian gene CLOCK plays an important role in regulating male reproduction. However, the underlying mechanism still remains unclear. In the present study, we executed yeast two-hybrid screening using cDNA fragment of CLOCK PAS A domain as bait, and identified RANBP9 as a novel protein interacting with CLOCK. The interaction between CLOCK and RANBP9 was further validated by in vivo and in vitro assays. Previous studies have confirmed that SF3B3 was a RANBP9 interacting protein. Subsequently, our study also found that CLOCK and SF3B3 can interact with each other by co-immunoprecipitation in mouse testis. In order to dissect the underlying mechanism of CLOCK in spermatogenesis, we also performed RNA-immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (RIP-Seq) in mouse testis. The result of sequence analyses and Gene Ontology enrichment analyses (biological processes) demonstrated that CLOCK can directly bind 186 key mRNA transcripts in mouse spermatogenesis. Taken together, our results firstly showed that CLOCK can interact with RANBP9 and bind with mRNAs, demonstrating that CLOCK is involved in alternative splicing in spermatogenesis. These results reveal a novel mechanism for CLOCK in spermatogenesis.

AB Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
   Methods: Serum miRNA expression analysis for the serum samples of patients with DLBCL and those of controls was performed using the Illumina sequencing technology. Differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified on the basis of the sequencing data. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction for the target genes of DEMs were also conducted. Moreover, the selected DEMs were verified using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
   Results: Fifty-one DEMs were identified between DLBCL disease and control groups, of which two were upregulated and 49 were downregulated. In total, 3631 target genes of DEMs were obtained, and hsa-miR-34a-5p had the most target genes. Among the 51 DEMs, 19 were significantly enriched in 41 KEGG pathways. hsa-miR-34a-5p was enriched in 15 pathways such as the p53 signaling pathway. hsa-miR-323b-3p was enriched in four pathways such as pathways in cancer. The PPI network revealed that hsa-miR-34a-5p had the most target genes such as tumor protein p53 (TP53), and hsa-miR-431-5p regulated tyrosine protein kinase Fyn (FYN). Furthermore, qRT-PCR results showed that hsa-miR-34a-5p was upregulated, whereas hsa-miR-323b-3p and hsa-miR-431-5p were downregulated.
   Conclusion: hsa-miR-34a-5p may be directly regulated by TP53 and may be involved in DLBCL development via the p53 signaling pathway. Furthermore, hsa-miR-323b-3p may be related to DLBCL by participating in pathways in cancer. hsa-miR-431-5p may also play a role in DLBCL by regulating FYN.

AB Lentinula edodes C91-3 is an edible mushroom that has demonstrated a remarkable anti-tumor effect in various cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we report the ability of recombinant thioredoxin-like latcripin 11 (LP-11) of Lentinula edodes C91-3 to suppress the proliferation of various cancer cells. The LP-11 gene of Lentinula edodes C91-3 was cloned in the pET-32a( +) expression vector and expressed in a prokaryotic system. The expressed protein was refolded by gradual dialysis and purified by affinity gel filtration chromatography. The antioxidant activity of LP-11 was tested by 1,1-dipheny1-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. The antitumor activity of recombinant LP-11 was tested in eight kinds of tumor cell lines by CCK-8 assay. Recombinant LP-11 significantly suppressed the proliferation of various cancer cells, but not normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Human lymphoma U937 cells exhibited the most sensitivity to LP-11 protein. U937 cell apoptosis was assessed by Annexin V staining coupled with flow cytometry, and mitochondrial morphology was analyzed by light and electron microscopy. It was revealed that recombinant LP-11 induced apoptosis in human leukemic monocyte lymphoma U937 cells. Our findings suggest that recombinant LP-11 is a promising agent for the treatment of lymphoma.

AB Background: Genome-wide association studies have resulted in the identification of the FTO gene as an important genetic determinant of diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to confirm the role of this gene in the development of DM in the Czech-Slavonic population and to analyse whether this gene is associated with common DM complications.
   Methods: Two groups of patients (814 with T1DM and 848 with T2DM) and a group of healthy controls (2339 individuals) - both of Czech origin - were genotyped for the FTO rs17817449 SNP. ANOVA and logistic regression were used for the statistical evaluations.
   Results: The frequency of the GG genotype was significantly higher in T2DM (25.4% vs. 16.7%, P < 0.0005) but not in T1DM patients (19.3% vs. 16.7%, P = 0.20) than in controls. The increased risk of development of diabetic nephropathy was observed both for T1DM patients (GG vs. TT homozygotes, P < 0.01) and T2DM patients (G carriers vs. TT homozygotes, P < 0.05). FTO genotype predicted the development of diabetic neuropathy (GG vs. TT comparison; P < 0.01) in the T2DM patients only. No association between FTO genotype and development of retinopathy was detected. All presented values are after adjustment for age, sex, BMI and duration of diabetes.
   Conclusions: We confirm the association between the FTO rs17817449 SNP and susceptibility to T2DM in the Czech-Slavonic population. The same variant is associated with a spectrum of chronic complications in both types of diabetes.

AB Myocardial infarction (MI) is a complex multifactorial cardiovascular disease. India experiences a much greater burden of MI, also suggesting an experimental increase of this burden in the future. The absolute reasons for MI are context dependent and differ with different geographical settings. Several reports indicate that SNPs that are associated with certain diseases in other populations may not be associated with Indian population. It is, therefore, important to validate the association of SNPs. Low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 8 (LRP8) gene plays central role in human lipoprotein metabolism as it facilitates the clearance of bad cholesterol LDL, VLDL from plasma and is reported to be associated with MI in the western population. However, this gene has not been studied in the South Indian population. We aim to test the role of the LRP8 gene variants correlating with the lipid profile in MI patients in South Indian population. We sequenced regions of SNPs rs10788952, rs7546246, rs2297660 and rs5174 of LRP8 in 100 MI patients and 100 age-matched controls. Our result revealed a total of 4 variations. None of the SNPs were significantly associated with MI (p > 0.973). Interestingly, haplotype based association analysis showed TG and CG of rs10788952 and rs7546246 significantly associated with MI (p < 0.01 and p < 0.00005) and in particular, haplotype TG was positively correlated with the risk of MI, as this increased the LDL and total cholesterol level in MI patients in south Indians. Our results suggest that haplotype TG is a risk factor for MI in South Indian population.

AB Acid hydrarthrosis is another important pathological character in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and acid-sensing ion channel la (ASIC1a) plays a destructive role in acidosis-induced articular chondrocyte cytotoxicity. Recently, ASIC2a has been reported to possess neuroprotective effect on acidosis-induced injury of neuronal cells. However, whether ASIC2a has an enhanced effect on the protective effect of blocking ASIC1a and ASIC3 against acid-induced chondrocyte apoptosis is still unclear. The aim of present study was to investigate the chondroprotective effect of ASIC2a with PcTx1 (ASIC1a specific blocker) and APETx2 (ASIC3 specific blocker) on acidosis-induced chondrocyte apoptosis. Our results revealed that acid (pH 6.0) decreased the cell viability and induced apoptosis of articular chondrocytes. PcTx1 and APETx2 combination significantly attenuated acidosis induced chondrocyte cytotoxicity due to inhibit apoptosis, and this role could be enhanced by ASIC2a over expression compared with the PcTx1 and APETx2 combination alone group. Moreover, both the [Ca2+]; levels and the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 as well as p38 were further reduced in acidosis-induced chondrocytes after ASIC2a overexpression in the presence of PcTxl and APETx2. Furthermore, ASIC2a overexpression also reduced acid-induced the expression of ASIC1a. In addition, ASIC2a overexpression further promoted the PcTxl and APETx2-increased levels of type II collagen in acidosis-induced chondrocytes. Taken together, the current data suggested that ASIC2a overexpression might enhance the anti-apoptotic and protective role of PcTxl and APETx2 against acid-induced rat articular chondrocyte apoptosis by regulating ASIC1a expression and the [Ca2+]; levels and at least in part, suppressing p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathways.

AB Introduction: p53R2 is a p53-inducible protein that contributes to DNA repair by providing dNTPs in response to DNA damage. The roles of p53R2 in cancer cells and malignancies still remain controversial. Herein, we examined the effects of p53R2 silencing on HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma (HHC) cell line (wild-type p53) viability, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the presence and absence of doxorubicin.
   Methods: Cell transfection was performed using a liposomal approach. Gene silencing was determined by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis. To evaluate the cell growth rate after transfection, trypan blue dye exclusion assay was employed. The cytotoxicity of the doxorubicin and p53R2 siRNA as single agents or in combination against HepG2 cell was analyzed by MTT assay and the drug combination effects was evaluated by calculating the combination index. The effects of treatments on different stages of cell cycle were analyzed by flow cytometry using propidium iodide (PI) and induction of apoptosis was assessed using DNA-histone ELISA.
   Results: We found that silencing of p53R2 alone had a strong effect on growth inhibition and spontaneous apoptosis in HepG2 cells. p53R2 siRNA synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin. Furthermore, when used in combination with doxorubicin (0.4 mu M), a significant increase in the rate of apoptosis was observed (P < 0.05). Moreover, cell cycle at S and G2/M phases progressed at a lower rate after p53R2 combination treatment compared with dcntorubicin mono-therapy.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that siRNA-mediated silencing of p53R2 has great potential as a therapeutic tool and adjuvant in chemotherapy.

AB Embryo implantation is a complex process requiring reciprocal interactions between implantation-competent blastocysts and receptive uteri. Accumulating evidence from Digital Protein Expression Profiling indicates that DEK protein expression at implantation sites (ISs) was much higher than that at inter-implantation sites (IISs). In this study, we investigated the expression of DEK in mouse uterus by immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western blotting. We explored its function during decidualization of uterine stromal cells by inhibiting the expression of DEK. In further study of mechanism, the cell proliferation, apoptosis and DNA damage were detected after inhibiting DEK during decidualization of stromal cells. The results suggest that DEK participates in decidualization of stromal cells through mediating cell proliferation, apoptosis and DNA repair.

AB In this study, starvation-, thermal- and heavy metal-associated expression of four small Musca domestica HSPs (abbreviated as MdomHSPs and they are MdomHSP10, MdomHSP27, MdomHSP27.1 and MdomHSP27.2) were determined. The following results were found: All MdomHSPs were significantly higher expressed during the active larval and adult stages than the egg and pupal stages; All MdomHSPs were expressed at relatively equal levels in the head, thorax and abdomen of adults; The expression of MdomHSP27 was significantly down regulated in 4-day-old larvae that were starved for 6 h, while the other 3 MdomHSPs were not significantly affected; Thermal treatment altered the expression of MdomHSPs in 4-day-old larvae: MdomHSP10 was significantly down-regulated in 4-day-old larvae that were maintained at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C than in those that were maintained at 25 degrees C; Lead, cadmium and chromium exposure influenced larval expression of MdomHSPs to varying degrees. The expression dynamic profile of MdomHSPs would contribute to the understanding of their physiological role in M. domestica.

AB Mammalian POU5F1 (also known as OCT4) is an essential transcription factor that induces and controls sternness in the inner cell mass and embryonic stern (ES) cells. Its expression results from intricate regulatory networks involving its 5' upstream DNA elements and numerous transcription factors. Pou5f3, the ortholog of POU5F1, has been identified in non-mammalians including fish. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling its expression up to date. Here we report the promoter activity and regulation of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) pou5f3 (Onpou5f3) in fish early-stage embryos and ES cells. A 3.1-kb Onpou5f3 promoter region was cloned, analyzed and constructed into pT2AL-GFP vector. Multiple potential regulatory elements including potential octamer sequence for Pou domain and retinoic acid-responsive elements were found in the 5' upstream region. In vivo and in vitro transfection assays reveal that the 3.1-kb DNA sequence was sufficient to drive strong GFP expression in blastula-stage embryos and ES cells, but low or undetectable expression in either late developmental stage embryos or differentiated cells, suggesting the feasibility as a tool to monitor the pluripotency state in fish stem cells. Deletion luciferase assays reveal that the region from 726 to 219 contains positive regulatory elements, whereas both the regions from 3056 to 1306 and 1306 to 729 contain negative regulatory elements. Notably, just like mammalian POU5F1, OnPou5f3 significantly enhanced its own expression in a dose-dependent manner, whereas RA treatment dramatically reduced its expression. Taken together, our study not only provides a tool for monitoring the pluripotency state of fish stem cells in vitro, but also experimentally demonstrates the molecular mechanisms underlying the Pou5f1 homolog expression might be conserved to some content between mammals and fish.

AB The SWEET (sugars will eventually be exported transporter) family is a newly characterized group of sugar transporters. In plants, the key roles of SWEETs in phloem transport, nectar secretion, pollen nutrition, stress tolerance, and plant pathogen interactions have been identified. SWEET family genes have been characterized in many plant species, but a comprehensive analysis of SWEET members has not yet been performed in wheat. Here, 59 wheat SWEETs (hereafter TaSWEETs) were identified through homology searches. Analyses of phylogenetic relationships, numbers of transmembrane helices (TMHs), gene structures, and motifs showed that TaSWEETs carrying 3-7 TMHs could be classified into four clades with 10 different types of motifs. Examination of the expression patterns of 18 SWEET genes revealed that a few are tissue-specific while most are ubiquitously expressed. In addition, the stem rust-mediated expression patterns of SWEET genes were monitored using a stem rust-susceptible cultivar, 'Little Club' (LC). The resulting data showed that the expression of five out of the 18 SWEETs tested was induced following inoculation. In conclusion, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the wheat SWEET gene family. Information regarding the phylogenetic relationships, gene structures, and expression profiles of SWEET genes in different tissues and following stem rust disease inoculation will be useful in identifying the potential roles of SWEETs in specific developmental and pathogenic processes.

AB Background: Galectin-3 plays an important role in modulating cardiac inflammation and fibrosis. It also takes part in the pathways underlying cardiac remodeling. Therefore, LGALS3 gene, encoding galectin-3 protein, is a promising candidate for the genetic study of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). To date, there has been no research evaluating the association between LGALS3 gene polymorphisms and the susceptibility and prognosis of DCM.
   Methods and Results: Genotyping of 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the LGALS3 gene, which were reported to be functional in the literature, was performed in 279 unrelated clinically diagnosed DCM patients and 363 apparently healthy controls from Northern Han Chinese population using iPLEX SNP Genotyping analysis on a Sequenom MassARRAY System. The frequency of G allelic polymorphism of rs1009977 and the C allelic polymorphism of rs4652 were lower in DCM patients (OR = 0.77, 95% CI [0.60-0.99], P = 0.045; OR = 0.79, 95% CI [0.63-0.99], P = 0.042, respectively). The minor variants of rs1009977 and rs4652 were associated with low susceptibility of DCM under additive genetic models (P = 0.045 and P = 0.040, respectively). The AA genotype of both rs2274273 and rs4644 was associated with lower left ventricular ejection fraction (recessive model, P = 0.018 for both; additive model, P = 0.039 for both). The G variant of rs1009977 was related with lower serum galectin-3 level in DCM patients under three genetic models (additive model, P = 0.020, dominant model, P = 0.020, recessive model, P = 0.037). The A variant of both rs2274273 and rs4644 was associated with lower level of galectin-3 in DCM patients under additive model (P = 0.032 for both) and dominant model (P = 0.012 for both). None of the 4 SNPs was associated with the cardiovascular or all cause death rate of DCM. In Conclusion, LGALS3 gene polymorphisms might be associated with the susceptibility of DCM in a Northern Han Chinese population.

AB Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a very prevalent endocrine disease affecting reproductive women. Clinically, patients with this disorder are more vulnerable to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular events, as well as metabolic syndrome (MetS). To date, the molecular mechanism underlying PCOS remains largely unknown. Previously, we showed that mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation was an important cause for PCOS. In the current study, we described the clinical and biochemical features of a three-generation pedigree with maternally transmitted MetS, combined with PCOS. A total of three matrilineal relatives exhibited MetS including obesity, high triglyceride (TG) and Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, and hypertension. Whereas one patient from the third generation manifestated PCOS. Mutational analysis of the whole mitochondrial genes from the affected individuals identified a set of genetic variations belonging to East Asia haplogroup B4b1c. Among these variants, the homoplasmic C3275T mutation disrupted a highly evolutionary conserved base-pairing (28A-46C) on the variable region of tRNA(Leu(UUR)), whereas the T4363C mutation created a new base-pairing (31T-37A) in the anticodon stem of tRNA(Gln), furthermore, the A8343G mutation occurred at the very conserved position of tRNA(Lys) and may result the failure in mitochondrial tRNAs (mt-tRNAs) metabolism. Biochemical analysis revealed the deficiency in mitochondrial functions including lower levels of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), ATP production and mtDNA copy number, while a significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was observed in polymononuclear leukocytes (PMNs) from the individuals carrying these mt-tRNA mutations, suggesting that these mutations may cause mitochondrial dysfunction that was responsible for the clinical phenotypes. Taken together, our data indicated that mt-tRNA mutations were associated with MetS and PCOS in this family, which shaded additional light into the pathophysiology of PCOS that were manifestated by mitochondrial dysfunction.

AB Genetic factors are widely recognized to have a substantial effect on the susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We examined the contribution of caspase-5 (CASP5) gene polymorphisms to RA risk in a Chinese population. We conducted a case-control study involving 500 RA patients and 500 controls and performed co-expression analysis to identify genes associated with CASP5. We attempted to analyze the functions of these genes by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses. We carried out genotyping using a custom-by-design 48-Plex SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) Scan (TM) Kit. The independent effects of these genetic loci were evaluated by creating genetic risk scores (GRS). Bioinformatics analysis confirmed that CASP5 was related to the development of inflammation, which is the main feature of RA. In addition, the CASP5 rs9651713 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of RA, but there was no significant association between any other tested polymorphism (rs2276414, rs2282657, rs3181171, rs3181318, rs3181175, rs3181337, and rs552217) and RA risk. In addition, a high GRS was positively correlated with the risk of RA. In conclusion, CASP5 may contribute to the development of RA by mediating inflammation. Larger studies with more diverse ethnic populations are needed to confirm these results.

AB We previously identified the aur1 gene cluster, responsible for the production of the angucycline antibiotic auricin in Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM 3239. Pulse-field gel electrophoresis showed a single, 241 kb linear plasmid, pSA3239, in this strain, and several approaches confirmed the presence of the aurl cluster in this plasmid. We report here the nucleotide sequence of this 241,076-bp plasmid. pSA3239 contains an unprecedentedly small (13 bp) telomeric sequence CCCGCGGAGCGGG, which is identical to the conserved Palindrome I sequence involved in the priming of end-patching replication. A bioinformatics analysis revealed 234 open reading frames with high number (28) of regulatory genes from various families. In contrast to most other linear plasmids, pSA3239 contains a pair of replication initiation genes (sa76 and sa75) located at its extreme left end, adjacent to the telomere. Together with similar proteins from several other linear plasmids (pFRL2, pSLA2-M, pSV2, pSDA1, and SAP1), they constitute a new family of replication initiation proteins. This left end also contains two genes, tpgSa and tapSa, encoding the terminal protein and the telomere associated protein involved in telomere end-patching replication. pSA3239 also contains two genes homologous to the parAB partitioning system, and deletion of the parA homologue (sa43) affects structural stability of the plasmid. pSA3239 carries five potential secondary metabolite gene clusters. In addition to aurl and a non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) gene cluster for the blue pigment indigoidine, it also contains a partial type II polyketide synthase (PKS) gene cluster, a partial type I PKS gene duster, and a NRPS/PKSI gene cluster for unknown secondary metabolites. The last gene cluster contains a subcluster of seven genes (sa91-sa97), highly similar to part of the valanimycin biosynthetic cluster vim. A S. aureofaciens strain lacking pSA3239 was prepared. This deletion did not substantially affect growth and differentiation. A comparative analysis of secondary metabolites between both strains did not identify any product, except auricin and indigoidine, which is dependent upon pSA3239. Thus, the other three identified gene clusters are likely silent under these conditions.

AB Isoprenaline, an activator of beta-adrenergic receptor, has been found to induce cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro, but the exact mechanism is still unclear. ClC-3 is a member of the chloride channel family and is highly expressed in mammalian myocardium. In the present study, the role of ClC-3 in isopronaline-induced cardiac hypertrophy was investigated. We found that ClC-3 expression was reduced in isoprenaline-induced hypertrophic H9c2 cells, primary rat neonatal cardiomyocytes and myocardium of C57/BL/6 mice, and this reduction was prevented by the pretreatment of propranolol. Adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-mediated ClC-3 expression in myocardium decreased heart mass index, thinned interventricular septum and left ventricular wall and lowered the mRNA expression of natriuretic peptide type A (ANF) and beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC). Our results showed that ClC-3 played an important role in beta-adrenergic cardiac hypertrophy which could be associated with ANF and beta-MHC, and all these findings suggested that ClC-3 may be a novel therapeutic target for the prevention or treatment of myocardiac hypertrophy.

AB Pheromones are crucial for eliciting innate responses and inducing social and sexual behaviors in mammals. The vomeronasal receptor 1 genes, V1Rs, encode members of a pheromone receptor family that are mainly expressed in the vomeronasal organ (VNO). The V1R family shows extraordinary variety in gene number among vertebrates owing to successive gene gains and losses during evolution. Such diversity is believed to reflect a degree of dependence on the VNO. We investigated V1R evolution in primate lineages closely related to humans because these VNOs show a trend toward degeneration. We performed extensive phylogenetic analyses for V1Rs from a broad range of primate species. Although the decline of intact genes was evident in anthropoids (hominoids, Old World monkeys and New World monkeys), we found that a certain number of intact genes persist in New World monkeys. In one New World monkey species, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), we examined seven putatively functional V1Rs using in situ hybridization and reverse transcription-PCR. Based on their mRNA expression patterns in the VNO and other organs, two types of V1Rs emerged: the canonical class with VNO-specific expression, and a second group having more ubiquitous expression in various organs as well as VNO. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis revealed that the class with the more widespread expression had been retained longer in evolution than the VNO-specific type. We propose that the acquisition of a novel nonVNO related function(s) may have led to the survival of a small but persistent number of V1Rs in anthropoid primates.

AB Waardenburg syndrome type 1 (WS1) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder of neural crest cells (NCC) characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing loss, dystopia canthorum, and abnormal iris pigmentation. WS1 is due to loss-of-function mutations in paired box gene 3 (PAX3). Here, we identified a novel PAX3 mutation (c.808C > G, p.R270G) in a three-generation Chinese family with WS1, and then analyzed its in vitro activities. The R270G PAX3 retained nuclear distribution and normal DNA-binding ability; however, it failed to activate MITF promoter, suggesting that haploinsufficiency may be the underlying mechanism for the mild WS1 phenotype of the study family.

AB Enzymatic degradation of cellulosic waste to generate renewable biofuels has offered an attractive solution to the energy problem. Synergistic hydrolysis of cellulose residues requires the participation of three different types of cellulases - endoglucanases, exoglucanases, and beta-glucosidases (Bgl). Our group has been interested in using Bgl of Cellulomonas biazotea in studies designed to investigate cooperative action among different cellulases. We previously have cloned bgl genes encoding Cba and Cba3, which are C. biazotea Bgl isozymes representing two different Bgl families, respectively; specifically, Glycoside Hydrolase Family 3 (GH3) and Glycoside Hydrolase Family 1 (GH1). To gain an understanding of the complexity of Bgl in C. biazotea, we analyzed E. coli clones containing plasmids into which C. biazotea DNA had been inserted; these clones could hydrolyze 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-D-glucopyranoside (MUG) supplemented in solid agar media, suggesting they might contain bgl genes. Through restriction analysis and DNA sequencing, two novel bgl genes, designated cba4 and cba5 and encoding Cba4 (484 amino acids) and Cba5 (758 amino acids) were identified. Cba4 and Cba5 appear to be members of GH1 and GH3, respectively. Both Cba4 and Cba5 were concluded to be genuine cellobiases as each was found to enable their E. coli hosts to survive on media in which cellobiose was the sole carbon source. Despite lacking a typical secretory signal sequence, Cba4 and Cba5 are secretory proteins. Although they are isoenzymes, Cba, Cba3, Cba4, and Cba5 were shown to possess distinct substrate specificities. These four Bgl members may play important roles in hydrolyzing a wide variety of beta-glucosides including cellobiose and non cellulosic substrates.

AB Background" Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is caused, in approximately 80% of the patients, by autoantibodies against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The disease is often associated with pathological changes of the thymus: thymic epithelial tumours are present in about 10-20% of the patients, while up to 80% of the patients with early disease onset have thymic hyperplasia. Folate metabolism is required for the production of DNA precursors and for proper DNA methylation reactions, and impaired folate metabolism has been often associated with cellular growth and cancer.
   Methods: We investigated if major polymorphisms of folate-related genes, namely MTHFR c.677C > T, MTR c.2756A > G, MTRR c.66A > G and TYMS TSER (a 28-bp tandem repeat in the 5' promoter enhancer region of TYMS) increase the risk of pathological changes of the thymus in AChR + MG patients. A total of 526 AChR + MG patients, including 132 patients with normal (involuted) thymus, 146 patients with thymic hyperplasia, and 248 patients with a thymoma were included in the study. Allele and genotype comparisons were performed among the three study groups, after correcting for multiple testing.
   Results: The frequency of the TYMS TSER 3R allele was significantly higher in MG patients with thymic hyperplasia (P = 0.004), and the TYMS TSER 3R3R genotype was significantly associated with increased risk of thymic hyperplasia [OR 2.71 (95% CI: 1.34-5.47)].
   Conclusions: The 3R allele in the thymidylate synthase promoter enhancer region results in increased protein production, required for the synthesis of DNA precursors. The present study suggests that the TYMS TSER 3R allele increases the risk of thymic lymphoid hyperplasia in AChR + MG patients.

AB Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway plays an important role in cellular response to inflammatory cytokines, environmental stress and pathogenic infection, However, compared with mammals and insects, the potential function of p38 MAPK from Chinese shrimp (Fenneropenaeus chinensis) in response to viruses and bacterial infection is limited. In the study, the immune responses of four genes MKK3, MKK4, p38 and ATF-2 from F. chinensis were investigated in defending against white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), Vibrio anguillarum (V. anguillarum) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection. Results demonstrated that the expression levels of these four genes were apparently modulated in hemocytes and gills when shrimp were stimulated by WSSV or bacteria, particularly at 3-24 h after infection. MKK3, p38 and ATF-2 were most sensitive to V. anguillarum (Gram-negative bacteria), followed by WSSV and S. aureus (Gram-positive bacteria), while MKK4 gene was most sensitive to S. aureus, followed by WSSV and V. anguillarum. Knockdown of Fcp38 by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in a reduction in the expression of FcMKK3 and FcATF-2. The results indicate that p38MAPK signaling pathway plays a role in defending against viral and bacterial infections in F. chinensis.

AB This study aimed to sequence and identify a glycosyl hydrolase family 9 (GHF9) endo-beta-1,4-glucanase expressed in the midgut gland of the herbivorous gecarcinid land crab, Gecarcoidea natalis. Hence this would explain the gene responsible for the production of previously purified and characterised endo-beta-1,4-glucanases. Three different transcripts, two complete and one partial were sequenced from cDNA and an open reading frame of 1383 bp was produced. Translated, this would produce a putative protein of 460 amino acid residues, including a 16 amino acid residue signal peptide. The mature protein (without signal peptide) is predicted to have a molecular mass of 47.6-47.7 kDa; this closely matches the molecular mass (47.4 kDa) of one of the three endo-beta-1,4-glucanase/lichenase enzymes purified previously from G. natalis. It is therefore proposed that the gene described here encodes one of the previously characterised enzymes. The presence of multiple transcripts suggests gene duplication. To confirm that the gene is widely expressed within the Crustacea, cDNA encoding a GHF9 endo-beta-1,4-glucanase was also sequenced in diverse crustaceans, the deposit feeding soldier crab, Mictyris platycheles and the terrestrial hermit crabs, Coenobita purlatus and C. brevimanus. An open reading frame of 1356 bp was sequence from M. platycheles, while an incomplete open reading frames of 1384 and 1523 bp were respectively sequenced from Coenobita brevimanus and C. perlatus. The midgut gland of M. platycheles contained activity (0.704 +/- 0.218 mu nol reducing sugars produced. min(-1).mg(-1) tissue wet weight) of a 26.3 +/- 0.3(5) endo-beta-1,4-glucanase isozyme (determined from activity staining). These species, particularly M. platycheles does not consume and digest significant amounts of plant cellulose. This implies that the ancestral enzyme is not a cellulase, but rather it may be involved in hydrolysing cellulose like polysaccharides within other organisms such as algae.

AB Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) play significant roles in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation and reproduction in diverse organisms. Here, we report the identification of medaka igf1 and the expression pattern of igf1 RNA in adult medaka gonads. Using RT-PCR, igf1 RNA was easily detected in several somatic organs and adult gonads of both sexes. Using chromogenic in situ hybridization, igf1 RNA in the ovary was found in stage I-IV oocytes and in the somatic cells throughout oogenesis. In the testis, igf1 RNA was present in meiotic products and the somatic cells surrounding male germ cells throughout spermatogenesis. We performed fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunostaining for the Vasa protein as a germ cell marker on gonadal cryosections. We showed that igf1 RNA in the ovary was most abundant in theca cells and meiotic oocytes at stage I-IV, which was detectable in granulosa cells and infrequently occurred in the mature oocytes at stage V but was absent in oogonia. The igf1 RNA in the testis was most prominent in Leydig cells and Sertoli cells and meiotic spermatids and sperm as well as detectable in spermaotgonia and spermatocytes. We conclude that differential igf1 RNA expression identifies medaka somatic cells and meiotic germ cells of both sexes.

Inspite of that they share certain commonality in gene expression patterns and a number of cellular & molecular features. Consequently, in the present study we aimed to evaluate the role of a definite set of genes in fetal liver, primary liver cancers and metastatic liver tissue.
   Methods: The relative expression of fourteen candidate genes obtained by data mining and manual curation of published data (CXCL12, CXCR4, CK7, CDH1, CTNNB1, CLDN4, VEGFA, HIF1A, MMP9, p53, OPN, CDKN2A, TGFBR2, MUC16, beta-actin) were performed on 62 tissues (32 liver metastasis tissues and 30 primary Liver cancer tissues), Fetal liver tissues (below and above 20 weeks of gestation) and 2 sets of control samples by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR).
   Results: Results showed significant down-regulation of MMP9 and TP53 in Fetal liver above 20 weeks of gestation whereas it was up-regulated in fetal liver below 20 weeks of gestation, primary liver cancers and liver metastasis. Contradictory to that OPN and CDKN2A were significantly up-regulated in primary liver cancer, liver metastasis; down-regulated in fetal liver above 20 weeks of gestation but were not expressed during early embryo development (below 20 weeks of gestation). Moreover, MMP9 and TP53 demonstrated a strong correlation with MUC16 whereas CDKN2A and OPN showed correlation with CXCL12/CXCR4 signifying that MUC16, CXCL12/CXCR4 might be involved in the complex process of cancer metastasis.
   Conclusion: MMP9, OPN, TP53 and CDKN2A were the identified markers that were expressed in a similar pattern in early embryonic development and cancer development & invasion suggesting that these genes are activated during embryogenesis and might be re-expressed in cancer metastasis. Moreover, these genes govern a pathway that might be activated during cancer metastasis. Thus, targeting these molecules may provide better treatment for metastatic liver cancers.

AB Double sex and mab-3 related transcription factor 1 (Dmrt1), an evolutionarily conserved gene, is a sex-related gene expressed in male gonads, that is involved in the regulation of sex differentiation, testicular development and reproductive function maintenance. Until now, functional studies on the Dmrt1 gene in sheep (Ovis aries) have been lacking. In this study, testis, heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and longissimus dorsi muscle tissues were collected from Small-Tail Han sheep at 0, 2, 5, 12 and 24 months after birth (mab). Dmrt1 expression and cellular localization were detected in various testicular tissues by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), western blot and immunohistochemistry methods. The morphological structures of testicular tissues at different developmental stages were observed by hematoxylin & eosin (HE) staining. The Dmrt1 mRNA expression levels in 12 and 24 mab sheep were significantly higher than those in 0 and 2 mab sheep (P < 0.05), and Dmrt1 protein expression showed a similar trend. The qRT-PCR results in various tissues at 12 mab showed that Dmrt1 mRNA was predominantly expressed in testes. Immunohistochemical staining in testes at different developmental stages showed that Dmrt1 protein immunoreactive responses were mainly localized in Sertoli cells and gonocytes at 0, 2 and 5 mab, while they were localized in spermatocytes, sperm cells and some spermatogonia and Sertoli cells at 12 and 24 mab. We speculate that the Dmrt1 gene plays a vital role in postnatal sheep spermatogenesis, perhaps by regulating the maturation and functional maintenance of Sertoli cells, the proliferation and differentiation of gonocytes in prepubertal sheep testes, and the mitosis and meiosis of germ cells in adult sheep, but the specific mechanisms underlying these phenomena must be further studied and verified.

AB To unravel intricate mechanisms of gene regulation it is imperative to work in physiologically relevant conditions and therefore preferentially in single copy constructs, which are not always easy to manipulate. Such in vivo studies are generally based on enzymatic assays, microarrays, RNA-seq, qRT-PCR, or multicopy reporter gene systems, frequently with beta-galactosidase, luciferase or a fluorescent protein as reporter. Each method has its advantages and shortcomings and may require validation. Enzyme assays are generally reliable but may be quite complex, time consuming, and require a (expensive) substrate. Microarrays and RNA-seq provide a genome wide view of gene expression but may rapidly become expensive and time consuming especially for detailed studies with large numbers of mutants, different growth conditions and multiple time points. Multicopy reporter gene systems are handy to generate numerous constructs but may not provide accurate information due to titration effects of trans-acting regulatory elements. Therefore and in spite of the existence of various reporter systems, there is still need for an efficient and user-friendly tool for detailed studies and high throughput screenings. Here we develop and validate a novel and versatile fluorescent reporter tool to study gene regulation in single copy mode that enables real-time measurement. This tool bears two independent fluorescent reporters that allow high throughput screening and standardization, and combines modern efficient cloning methods (multicopy, in vitro manipulation) with classical genetics (in vivo homologous recombination with a stable, self-transmissible episome) to generate multi- and single copy reporter systems. We validate the system with constitutive and differentially regulated promoters and show that the tool can equally be used with heterologous transcription factors. The flexibility and versatility of this dual reporter tool in combination with an easy conversion from a multicopy plasmid to a stable, single copy reporter system makes this system unique and attractive for a variety of applications. Examples are in vivo studies of DNA-binding transcription factors (single copy) or screening of promoter and RBS libraries (multicopy) for synthetic biology purposes.

AB Background: Chronic allograft dysfunction (CAD) is characterized by allograft kidney interstitial fibrosis, the underlying mechanism of which is unclear. Our aim was to elucidate the role and mechanism of TNF-alpha-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in transplant kidney tubular interstitial fibrosis.
   Methods: Human kidney tissues from normal volunteers and CAD patients were assessed using periodic acid Schiff, Masson trichrome and immunohistochemical staining. mRNA and protein expression of E-cadherin, a smooth muscle actin (SMA) and fibronectin(FN) in renal proximal tubule epithelial (HK-2) cells after treatment with TNF-alpha under different conditions were assessed using western blot and qRT-PCR analysis. Cell motility and migration were assessed using wound healing and transwell assays. Expression of Smurf2 and TNF-alpha-signaling pathway -related proteins in HK-2 cells treated with TNF-alpha was detected by western blotting. E-cadherin and alpha-SMA expression was also assessed in Smurf2 plasmid-transfected or Smurf2 siRNA-treated HK-2 cells.
   Results: The expression of TNF-alpha, Smurf2, alpha-SMA, and fibronectin was significantly upregulated, while the expression of E-cad was downregulated in the CAD group compared with the normal group. The in vitro results showed that TNF-alpha remarkably upregulated the expression of Smurf2, a-SMA and fibronectin and down regulated the expression of E-cadherin in HK-2 cells and enhanced motility and migration in HK-2 cells. Overexpression of Smurf2 could promote the expression of alpha-SMA and inhibit the expression of E-cad, whereas knockdown of Smurf2 expression reversed TNF-alpha-induced upregulation of alpha-SMA and prohibited the reduction of E-cad expression. Furthermore, TNF-alpha-induced Smurf2 expression promoted EMT through the Akt signaling pathway.
   Conclusions: TNF-alpha induced EMT via the TNF-alpha/Akt/Smurf2 signaling pathways, and it may play a role in aggravating allograft kidney interstitial fibrosis in CAD patients.

AB The proteins of Ly-6 (lymphocyte antigen-6) family are involved in the regulation of immunoreaction, cell migration and adhesion, and neuronal excitability. However, little is known about the function of Ly-6 proteins in embryogenesis. Herein, we identified a GPI anchored Ly-6 member named ly6 expressed in pineal gland and eye (lypge). Dynamic expression pattern of lypge was revealed by whole mount in situ hybridization. It was strikingly expressed in the pineal gland and cone photoreceptor, and its expression was regulated by orthodenticle homolog 5 (otx5) which has been shown to control the expression of many pineal genes. In addition, we demonstrated that lypge was rhythmically expressed in larvae from 4 dpf on. Moreover, knockdown of lypge resulted in small head and small eye formed in zebrafish embryos. These suggest that Lypge is involved in the formation of the eye and pineal gland in early development of zebrafish.

AB Cell immortalization is the initial step for cancer development. To identify the differentially expressed genes regulated by DNA methylation over the course of human primary bronchial epithelial cell (HPBECs) immortalization, an immortalized HBE cell line (HBETT) was generated via introduction of an SV40 LT and a catalytic subunit of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) into the HPBECs. Microarrays of mRNA and DNA methylation were performed to compare the transcriptomes and DNA methylomes between these two types of cells. The results from the mRNA microarray revealed many genes whose expression changed upon cell immortalization. We identified signatures including global hypomethylation, perturbation of ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and PI3K-Akt pathways associated with cell immortalization. Moreover, we revealed 155 differentiated methylation regions (DMRs) within the CpG islands (CGIs) of 42 genes and the perturbation of several key pathways that might be involved in HBE cell immortalization. Among these genes, the hypermethylation of the plasma glutamate carboxypeptidase (PGCP) gene appeared specifically in lung cancer tissues. The inhibition of PGCP expression by promoter hypermethylation was observed in both immortal HBETT cells and benzo[a]pyrene (Bap)-transformed HBE cells. In conclusion, these findings provide new insight into the epigenetic modifications that are critical in the transition and maintenance of cell immortalization.

AB Melatonin is an endocrine neurohormone secreted by pinealocytes in the pineal gland. It exerts diverse physiological effects, such as circadian rhythm regulator and antioxidant. However, the functional importance of melatonin in spermatogenesis regulation remains unclear. The objectives of this study are to: (1) detect melatonin affection on miRNA expression profiles in GC-1 spg cells by miRNA deep sequencing (DeepSeq) and (2) define melatonin affected miRNA mRNA interactions and associated biological processes using bioinformatics analysis. GC-1 spg cells were cultured with melatonin (10(-7) M) for 24 h. DeepSeq data were validated using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis (qRT-PCR). A total of 176 miRNA expressions were found to be significantly different between two groups (fold change of > 2 or < 0.5 and FDR < 0.05). Among these expressions, 171 were up-regulated, and 5 were down-regulated. Ontology analysis of biological processes of these targets indicated a variety of biological functions. Pathway analysis indicated that the predicted targets were involved in cancers, apoptosis and signaling pathways, such as VEGF, TNF, Ras and Notch. Results implicated that melatonin could regulate the expression of miRNA to perform its physiological effects in GC-1 spg cells. These results should be useful to investigate the biological function of miRNAs regulated by melatonin in spermatogenesis and testicular germ cell tumor.

AB Efforts have been made to characterize the high-altitude adaption in Tibetan pigs and identified vast of genes or genomic regions undergone natural selection. Nonetheless, information concerning gene expression and DNA methylation changes response to low-altitude acclimation in Tibetan pigs is long overdue. To explore the exceptional mechanisms of gene expression and DNA methylation that are induced by low altitude environments in Tibetan pigs, we performed a comparative transcriptomic and DNA methylation analysis of skeletal muscle between indigenous Tibetan pigs that reside in high altitude regions (similar to 4000 m) and their counterparts that migrated to the geographically neighboring low-altitude regions (similar to 500 m) for nearly ten generations. Many genes that related to hypoxia response (EGLN3 and FLT1) and energy metabolism (TFB2M) were differentially expressed, but without significant DNA methylation changes. We also found genes embedded in differentially methylated regions were mainly involved in 'Starch and sucrose metabolism', 'glucuronosyltransferase activity' processes. Specifically, our results showed increased SIN3A mRNA expression, with hypomethylation status of its promoter, in longissimus dorsi muscle of low-altitude Tibetan pig. Another gene, CACNG6, showed decreasing expression level with an elevated methylation in its intron 3. These results indicated DNA-methylation-mediated expression alterations in low-altitude acclimation. We envision that this study will serve as a valuable resource for mammal acclimation research and agricultural food industry.

AB LW-215 is a newly synthesized flavonoid, which is the derivative of wogonin. Our group has previously confirmed that wogonin has an anti-angiogenic activity, while the anti-angiogenic effect of LW-215 is unclear. In this study, we explored whether LW-215 can inhibit angiogenesis and further probed the potential molecular mechanisms. We found that LW-215 inhibited migration and tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and immortalized endothelial EA.hy926 cells without a significant decrease in cell viability. Microvessels sprouting from rat aortic ring and chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model also revealed that LW-215 could suppress angiogenesis in vivo. Western blot and ELISA analysis indicated that LW 215 could prevent VEGFR2 activation though reducing VEGF autocrine other than VEGFR1. Thus, its downstream kinases, such as Akt, ERK and p38 signaling, were inhibited. Taken together, these results fully showed that LW-215 might be a promising anti-angiogenesis agent.

AB Sirtuins (SIRTs) is a family of NAD+ dependent histone deacetylases. SIRT6 takes play in glucose homeostasis, genomic stability and DNA repair. Although increased oxidative DNA damage and decreased DNA repair activity were determined in diabetes mellitus, the possible relation between level of oxidative DNA damage and SIRT6 expression has not been investigated so far. We determined SIRT6 expression and urinary 8-hydroxy deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels, marker of oxidative DNA damage, in cases with prediabetes (PreDM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
   SIRT6 gene expression was determined in peripheral blood leukocytes of 70 patients with type 2 diabetes, 50 cases in prediabetic stage and 40 healthy subjects. SIRT6 mRNA levels were determined by quantitive real time-polymerase chain reaction. SIRT6 protein was detected by immunocytochemical staining. Urinary 8-hydroxy deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels were measured by ELISA.
   There was no significant difference between groups for SIRT6 mRNA level. SIRT6 immunopositivity in T2DM group was lower when compared to those in preDM group (P < 0.05). SIRT6 positive cell number in T2DM and preDM groups were lower in comparison to control group (P < 0.01 for both), however, when study groups were subdivided into two groups according to their age, the difference between preDM and control groups disappeared in both mid-aged and old-aged groups. The urinary 8-OHdG level was found to be higher in the T2DM group in comparison to preDM group (P < 0.05). When age is taken into consideration, urinary 8-OHdG level in the T2DM group was found to be higher than those in both preDM and control groups in the old-aged cases but no significant difference was determined between groups in the mid-aged cases. There was no relation between SIRT6 expression and urinary 8-OHDG excretion.
   It was concluded that SIRT6 may take play in development of T2DM but this effect seems to be independent from repair of oxidative DNA damage.

AB With the sharp consumption of fossil energy and deterioration of ecological environment, wind power, as a clean and renewable energy resource, gains more and more attention from all over the world. However, due to the intermittency and stochastic nature of wind speed, an accurate wind power/speed forecasting is not only crucial for availably dispatching the wind power resource but also has a direct relationship with the State Grid operation safely and steadily. In this paper, an innovative hybrid wind speed fore-casting model, including fast ensemble empirical mode decomposition, sample entropy, phase space reconstruction and back-propagation neural network with two hidden layers, is proposed to enhance the accuracy of wind speed prediction. The data is firstly preprocessed by fast ensemble empirical mode decomposition and sample entropy. Subsequently, the prediction model called improved back-propagation neural network is built to forecast the sub-series, whose inputs and outputs are obtained in accordance to phase space reconstruction. To verify the effectiveness and advancement of the proposed model, the paper chooses the real data from two wind farms located in different site in China for experiments. Comparing with the benchmark models, the proposed model shows a better performance in short-term wind speed forecasting.

AB This paper analyses two Real-Time Optimization (RTO) strategies for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) system which is used as main energy source for Fuel Cell Hybrid Power Source (FCHPS) of the FC vehicle (FCV). In this study the optimization function was defined as mix of the FC net power and the Fuel Consumption Efficiency by using two weighting coefficients. The Global Extremum Seeking (GES) algorithm is proposed here as RTO method for multimodal optimization surfaces having many peaks on the plateau around the optimal point that is the Global Maximum Point (GMP). One of the fueling rates is Load-Following (LF) controlled in order to adapt the FC net power to load demand and assure the charge-sustaining mode for the battery. The GES algorithm will establish the optimal duty cycle for the Boost converter, so the proposed strategies will be called the Boost-GES-RTO strategies with Air-LF and Fuel-LF, respectively. The Static Feed Forward (sFF) control strategy will be used as reference for constant and variable load profile. The gaps in performance indicators were estimated for both Boost-GES-RTO strategies. For example, the gaps in FC system efficiency and fuel economy could be up to 1.61% and 1421pm, and 2.65 and 1141pm for the Boost-GES-RTO strategies with Air-LF and Fuel-LF. The performance of Boost-GES-RTO strategies was also shown by estimating the fuel economy for 6 kW FCHPS under variable load profile.

AB Butanol, as a fuel in internal combustion engines, has many advantages over ethanol as biologically derived component of gasoline. The benefits include higher energy density, less water solubility, and better engine compatibility. This study assesses four different chemical kinetic mechanisms for two butanol isomers (n-butanol and isobutanol) in a single-zone engine model and compares the results to experiments conducted on a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine. The simulations, and experiments, spanned a range of intake pressures (1.0-1.8 bar) and equivalence ratios (0.3-0.4). As was seen in the experiments, the numerical model was able to reflect delayed combustion timings as the intake temperature was decreased. Additionally, the mechanisms were able to qualitatively differentiate the fuel sensitivity of the two isomers, with n-butanol being more reactive than isobutanol across all cases. However, for each mechanism, the computational results for required intake temperature at a given combustion timing were different than that observed in experiments by 20 to 40 degrees C. Furthermore, the rate of change of intake temperature versus combustion timing varied across the mechanisms, which were all different than that of the experiments. Heat release rates, generation of intermediate species (OH, HO2, H2O2, CH2O, and CO), and temperature/pressure histories corresponded well with combustion timing, though significant differences existed between the mechanisms. The results indicated that kinetic mechanisms for butanol isomers do not reliably capture the ignition behavior of HCCI engines, which points to an acute development need as low temperature combustion strategies become an increasingly important part of the pathway towards engines with higher efficiencies and lower emissions.

AB Half of the global population already lives in urban areas, facing to the problem of air pollution mainly caused by the transportation system. The recently worsening of urban air quality has a direct impact on the human health. Replacing today's internal combustion engine vehicles with electric ones in public fleets could provide a deep impact on the air quality in the cities. In this paper, real mobility information is used as decision support for the taxi fleet manager to promote the adoption of electric taxi cabs in the city of San Francisco, USA. Firstly, mobility characteristics and energy requirements of a single taxi are analyzed. Then, the results are generalized to all vehicles from the taxi fleet. An electrificability rate of the taxi fleet is generated, providing information about the number of current trips that could be performed by electric taxis without modifying the current driver mobility patterns. The analysis results reveal that 75.2% of the current taxis could be replaced by electric vehicles, considering a current standard battery capacity (24-30 kWh). This value can increase significantly (to 100%), taking into account the evolution of the price and capacity of the batteries installed in the last models of electric vehicles that are coming to the market. The economic analysis shows that the purchasing costs of an electric taxi are bigger than conventional one. However, fuel, maintenance and repair costs are much lower. Using the expected energy consumption information evaluated in this study, the total spatio-temporal demand of electric energy required to recharge the electric fleet is also calculated, allowing identifying optimal location of charging infrastructure based on realistic routing patterns. This information could also be used by the distribution system operator to identify possible reinforcement actions in the electric grid in order to promote introducing electric vehicles.

AB The present paper introduced an experiment survey focusing on exploring the impact of hydrogen enrichment on improving the lean-burn performance of an n-butanol rotary engine. During the test, the engine speed and intake pressure were roughly set at 4000 rpm and 35 kPa, respectively. A constant spark advance of 45 CA was adopted through the test. Hydrogen volumetric fraction of the total intake was severally kept at 0% and 3%. The testing results manifested that the brake thermal efficiency and peak chamber temperature were heightened with hydrogen addition. Besides, the ignition delay and rapid combustion duration were both reduced with the hydrogen additive. Engine running stability gained an improvement by hydrogen supplement. Moreover, HC and CO emissions from the original n-butanol rotary engine were reduced after hydrogen adding. NOx emissions were increased with hydrogen enrichment while reduced with the increase of excess air ratio. This indicated that NOx emissions from both the n-butanol and hydrogen-blended n-butanol rotary engines could be reduced by lean combustion strategies.

AB Irradiance received on the earth's surface is the main factor that affects the output power of solar PV plants, and is chiefly determined by the cloud distribution seen in a ground-based sky image at the corresponding moment in time. It is the foundation for those linear extrapolation-based ultra-short-term solar PV power forecasting approaches to obtain the cloud distribution in future sky images from the accurate calculation of cloud motion displacement vectors (CMDVs) by using historical sky images. Theoretically, the CMDV can be obtained from the coordinate of the peak pulse calculated from a Fourier phase correlation theory (FPCT) method through the frequency domain information of sky images. The peak pulse is significant and unique only when the cloud deformation between two consecutive sky images is slight enough, which is likely possible for a very short time interval (such as 1 min or shorter) with common changes in the speed of cloud. Sometimes, there will be more than one pulse with similar values when the deformation of the clouds between two consecutive sky images is comparatively obvious under fast changing cloud speeds. This would probably lead to significant errors if the CMDVs were still only obtained from the single coordinate of the peak value pulse. However, the deformation estimation of clouds between two images and its influence on FPCT-based CMDV calculations are terrifically complex and difficult because the motion of clouds is complicated to describe and model. Therefore, to improve the accuracy and reliability under these circumstances in a simple manner, an image-phase-shift-invariance (IPSI) based CMDV calculation method using FPCT is proposed for minute time scale solar power forecasting. First, multiple different CMDVs are calculated from the corresponding consecutive images pairs obtained through different synchronous rotation angles compared to the original images by using the FPCT method. Second, the final CMDV is generated from all of the calculated CMDVs through a centroid iteration strategy based on its density and distance distribution. Third, the influence of different rotation angle resolution on the final CMDV is analyzed as a means of parameter estimation. Simulations under various scenarios including both thick and thin clouds conditions indicated that the proposed IPSI-based CMDV calculation method using FPCT is more accurate and reliable than the original FPCT method, optimal flow (OF) method, and particle image yelocimetry (PIV) method.

AB A novel waste heat utilization system, which consists of transpired solar collector panels and capillary tube heat exchanger, is studied; its function principle is described, and its experimental performance is presented for the first time. A test unit of capillary tubes was installed at the solar wall air heater at the factory of an automotive company in Turkey in 2012. Capillary tubes utilized waste heat energy which is obtained from heat recovery unit of an air compressor. Thermal power output, ambient temperature, temperature rise, collector cavity temperatures, and water supply temperatures were monitored over the course of two winters. The results showed that capillary tubes can provide 15 degrees C temperature rise during night-time operation. The heat exchange effectiveness in air cavity is found to be maximum 0.7. The results also show that waste heat energy utilization can reach up to 85% depending on operating conditions.

AB As a new type of high-intensity combustion technology, oxy-fuel combustion technology can effectively reduce the generation and emission of pollutants, particularly near zero emission of carbon dioxide when applied to the waste incineration process. Compared to the conventional air waste-to-energy incineration power generation, the municipal solid waste oxy-fuel combustion power generation system is more complex, resulting in a relatively large space for optimization. In this work, a waste-to-energy incineration power plant in Shenzhen, China, is taken as the original object, and used to establish the process simulation of the conventional plant using Aspen plus. The results are compared and verified with the operation data. Based on the results, models or subsystems are set up for the air separation unit, the municipal solid waste oxy-fuel combustion power system and the flue gas processing compression system, respectively. Then, the subsystems are coupled and connected to establish the whole process simulation of the waste oxy-fuel combustion power plant, and the optimization analyses of the overall plant operating parameters are presented. The results show that the best supplying oxygen concentration is 96%, the carbon dioxide recovery rate of the entire system is 96.24%, and near-zero carbon dioxide emission is basically achieved. The energy consumptions sharing by the flue gas processing compression subsystem, the air separation subsystem, and the others account for 19.82%, 54.29%, and 25.89% of the total energy consumption, respectively. After coupling optimization analysis, the net power generation efficiency of the municipal solid waste oxy-fuel combustion plant increases 2.69%, from 6.88% to 9.57%.

AB This work presents an advanced exergy and environmental analysis of a steam cycle of a municipal solid waste incineration plant, with energy recovery for electricity generation; employing MSW of the city of Santo Andre in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Initially, a plant energy analysis is accomplished to determine some thermodynamic performance indicators, as well a conventional exergetic analysis is performed, to determine the magnitude of exergy destruction in each one of plant main components. To identify the potential for improvement in the incineration steam cycle, an advanced exergetic analysis was done, with exergy destruction divided into four categories: endogenous, exogenous, avoidable and unavoidable. With all this it was calculated that total plant exergy destruction can be reduced by 8.4%, through increments in efficiency in plant components taking into account best existing technologies and operating parameters that represent an avoidable total cost of $2'830,624 per year.
   Finally, a Life Cycle Analysis using the IMPACT Method 2002 + was carried out to determine environmental impacts of plant operation considering two cases: Reference Case (Case A) and the Improved One (Case B). Case B was divided in three comparative scenarios (B1, B2 and B3) which were considered to evaluate the environmental impact of plant operation and dislocation of primary energy. The results shows that reduction of avoidable exergy destruction in a steam generating cycle leads to an emission index reduction from 531 to -224 kg CO2eq/MWh, while a primary energy displacement about 3.69 kWh per unit of electric energy available was reached, using MSW as fuel in steam cycle.

AB Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is a promising technology of converting the low-grade thermal energy to electricity. But the pump work accounts for a large percentage of the expander output power in the small-scale system, which greatly worsens the system efficiency. In this paper, a novel organic Rankine cycle with a vapor liquid ejector (EORC) is proposed to enhance the system performance. It is compared to the conventional ORC and a regenerative organic Rankine cycle (RORC), and the results show that it has higher system efficiency when the pump has a low efficiency and the evaporating temperature is high. A parametrical study on this novel system is further carried out with three working fluids, namely, R123, R1233zd(E) and R1336mzz(Z). The ejector behavior and system performance are strongly interacted, which are elaborated and discussed. There exists an optimal ejector entrainment ratio that minimizes the pump work and maximizes the system efficiency. The ejector area ratio and the subcooling at the condenser outlet have great influence on the ejector pressure lift, leading to the significant variations of temperature in the evaporator I, however, their influence on the expander output power is moderate. As for the condensing temperature, it has remarkable effect on system performance except the ejector pressure lift. The three candidates have similar features of variations for the considered variables. R1233zd(E) is recommended as the good working fluid since it has higher system efficiency than R1336mzz(Z) and is more favored by the environment than R123.

AB The biodegradable fraction of municipal solid waste (BMSW), dominantly composed of starchy and lignocellulosic materials, has high potential to be used for liquid biofuel production. Hot water or dilute acid treatment at high temperature was utilized for the solubilization or hydrolysis of the starch fraction and pretreatment of the lignocellulosic fraction. The treatment liquor, which was rich in sugars and starch, was evaluated for acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE) production by Clostridium acetobutylicum, and it was found that phenolic compounds, especially tannins, critically inhibited the butanol production. To improve ABE production, the extraction of phenolic compounds prior to hot water or dilute acid treatment was evaluated. Among the evaluated extractants, i.e., acetone, ethanol, butanol, and water, ethanol showed the highest amount of tannin extraction, resulting in an 87% reduction in tannin content. Dilute acid treatment of the ethanol extracted BMSW at 140 degrees C for 60 min resulted in a liquor containing 23 g/L glucose and 41 g/L soluble starch, which was fermented to the highest ABE concentration of 17 g/L with productivity of 0.24 g/L/h. The fermentation of liquor obtained by dilute acid treatment of butanol, acetone, and water-extracted BMSW was accompanied by 9, 6, and 4 g/L ABE production. Even by hot water treatment, the liquor obtained from ethanol extracted BMSW was fermented to the highest ABE concentration of 8 g/L. In addition to the liquor, the pretreated lignocellulosic material was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis and ABE fermentation, leading to production of 5-6 g/L ABE. This process resulted in the production of 83.9 g butanol, 36.6 g acetone, and 20.8 g ethanol from each kg of BMSW. Moreover, the co-production of ethanol by ABE fermentation reduced concerns about organic extractor loss in the extraction process, which was inescapable in the tannin extraction process.

AB This paper aims to explore the alternatives for waste heat recovery in a floating production storage and offl-oading (FPSO) platform to meet the demand for heat (from hot water) and to maximize the electric power generation through the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) with purpose to increase the overall thermal efficiency of the process and reduce CO2 emissions. Two different cycles' configurations are explored (simple and regenerative) using exhaust gases from the gas turbines as the heat sources for the ORC and the cogeneration system. The curves of the GE LM2500 and GE LM2000 turbines are modeled together with the water heating systems and the organic Rankine cycle. The model is solved using a genetic algorithm optimization method, whose objective function is set to meet the electric power demand for the FPSO platform. The purchased equipment costs of the ORC, the reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 avoided are estimated. Waste heat recovery meets the heat demand and contributes up to 21% of the electric energy demand, which increases the overall efficiency of the system, and improves the utilization factor by up to 10.8% and 19.2%, respectively. There is an average reduction of 22.5% in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions during the lifetime of the FPSO. The economic analysis based on the NPV shows that a US$12.55 million return on investment is possible, in addition to reducing the initial investment cost by US$14.2 million through the exclusion of the GE LM2500 gas turbine at project implementation.

AB The present investigation evaluates the potential of fifteen heterocystous cyanobacterial strains for biodiesel and hydrocarbon production. Fatty acid composition, biodiesel qualities along with biomass, lipid and hydrocarbon productivity were determined under autotrophic growth conditions. The biomass productivity of tested cyanobacterial strains ranged from 8.25 to 24.39 mg L-1 day(-1) dry cell weight (DCW), whereas the lipid and hydrocarbon productivity ranged from 0.747 to 3.259 mg L-1 day(-1) and 0.153 to 0.516 mg L-1 day(-1), respectively. Palmitic acid (3.79-40.84%) and stearic acid (14.64-69.84%), which are favourable for biodiesel production, were predominantly present in tested cyanobacterial strains. Biodiesel fuel properties were estimated by empirical formulas based on FAME composition and met the prescribed criteria of international biodiesel standards like ASTM D6751 in the United States, EN 14214 in Europe and IS 15607 in India. Nostoc calcicoia MBDU 602, with a lipid content of 18.921 +/- 0.096 (% dwt), lipid productivity of 3.259 +/- 0.211 mg L-1 day(-1) and desirable fatty acid composition of C16-C18 (57.78%) was selected as the most suitable species for biodiesel production through PROMETHEE-GAIA analysis. The selected strain could possibly be exploited at commercial scale after further evaluation of up- and down-stream process at pilot experiment using photo-bioreactors.

AB Ethanol is one of the most desirable fuels for spark-ignition engines. It offers high-octane quality and a latent heat of vaporization that is four times greater than gasoline on a stoichiometric basis. Anhydrous ethanol can also readily be blended into oil-based fuels, thereby enabling improved engine efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the use of ethanol is currently constrained by low yield production processes and a reliance on considerable amounts of arable land to cultivate the most widely utilized feedstocks. These challenges could be addressed if ethanol was instead derived synthetically from petroleum-based feedstocks. This paper presents a comparative well-to-wheel assessment for three different engine-fuel systems that leverage the benefits of ethanol which has been derived synthetically and from the fermentation of biomass. In the baseline case, anhydrous ethanol (99.5% by volume) derived from corn is used to produce a high-octane E30 gasoline (RON 101). The alternative case considers synthetic hydrous ethanol (similar to 90% by volume) which is derived from direct hydration of ethene in a crude oil refinery. Hydrous ethanol is immiscible in gasoline, and is therefore utilized as a high-octane fuel for the Octane-on-Demand concept. The same engine-fuel system operated on anhydrous bioethanol is also considered for comparative purposes. Single cylinder engine tests are first used to characterize the specific fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for the different engine-fuel systems. This data is then used to construct fuel consumption maps to simulate the drive cycle fuel economy of a light-duty vehicle. Finally, the well-to-wheel GHG emissions are computed, with consequent uncertainties assessed using Monte Carlo analysis. The results demonstrate that the well-to-wheel GHG emissions for the three different engine-fuel systems are generally comparable. This is despite the Octane-on-Demand cases offering improved drive cycle fuel economy with respect to the E30 gasoline. These outcomes are shown to be largely insensitive to uncertainties in the upstream fuel production GHG emissions. Overall, this suggests that the use of synthetic ethanol in advanced engine-fuel systems could supplement bioethanol derived from first and second generation feedstocks in the future transport energy mix.

AB The mechanism of synergistic effects occurred during co-pyrolysis of cellulose (CE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE), mixed at various mass ratios (3:1, 1:1, 1:3 w/w), was studied by thermogravimetric analysis coupled with mass spectrometry (TG-MS) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The TG analysis showed that the co-pyrolysis process was divided into two-stages: the first stage was the decomposition of CE (at 260 degrees C-410 degrees C), and the second stage between 410 degrees C and 527 degrees C was mainly the decomposition of HDPE. The experimental mass loss values of the mixtures were greater than the estimated values, which confirmed a synergistic effect in the co-pyrolysis of CE and HDPE. The results of MS and Py-GC/MS indicated that the effects of co-pyrolysis promoted the release of small-molecule volatile (H2O, CO/C2H4, CO2), and the promotion effect was strongest when the ratio was 1:3. Hydrogen transfer from the scission of HDPE could be provided for the decomposition of CE, and the oxygen-containing compounds from CE could promote the chain scission and cracking of HDPE. When the CE/HDPE ratio was less than 1:1, the production of carbohydrate, aldehyde, ketone, and furan groups assigned to CE pyrolysis was suppressed, and the production of alkane and alkene groups was promoted. The decomposition pathways in the co-pyrolysis process of CE and HDPE were proposed.

AB Buoyancy has been found to have a significant influence on the flow and heat transfer behaviors of turbulent sCO(2). This paper uses the computational method to investigate the flow and heat transfer characteristics of turbulent sCO(2) in a large horizontal tube with the buoyancy effects taken into account, RNG and three selected low-Reynolds number k-epsilon turbulence models have been validated against experiments published in literatures. Using the validated CFD model, the buoyancy mechanisms affecting sCO(2) flow and heat transfer within large horizontal tubes are revealed, and the effect of the heat flux have been analyzed. Comparison against experimental results suggests that AEN low-Reynolds number model exhibits the best prediction. Buoyancy influences the flow structure and turbulence levels mainly via the induced secondary circulation. Buoyancy effects are stronger at increased heat flux values. The secondary circulation becomes pronounced at higher heat flux levels and increases the temperature difference between the top and bottom tube surfaces. In large horizontal tubes, slight heat transfer enhancements in the mixed convection are observed near the pseudocritical point. However, a significant deterioration is found at higher heat load density. This is a result contrary to past reports confined to small diameter tubes.

AB There is an enormous untapped potential for hydropower generation in rivers with large head and high flow variation, currently not feasible for conventional hydropower dams. Conventional dams make use of the potential energy, but waste kinetic energy from spillage during periods of high flows. This article studies the possibility of harnessing energy from potential and kinetic energy from hydropower dams with large head and flow variation, analyses its potential, and shows possible technologies. Focus is given to a Moveable Hydro Electric Power Plant (HEPP) system in which the turbine module can be adjusted according to the flow and water level in the river. During floods the exceeding flows can pass above and below the Moveable HEPP results in a sub-pressure environment after the turbine module, thereby reducing the dam's downstream head, increasing the pressure difference between the turbine inlet and outlet and the flow through the turbine, which increases the electricity generation of the dam. Dams with head increaser arrangement have been implemented in several dams in the 1930-1950s and now are regaining attention in Middle Europe. The main intention for its implementation is harnessing hydropower generation at run-of-river plants, with low-head, with a 20%-30% cost reduction, lower flooded area at the dam site, the resulting evaporation and the impact on the aquatic fauna.
   A case study was performed with the proposal of the Aripuand Moveable HEPP in the Madeira River with a 26 ms height dam and a generation capacity of 1400 MW. The increase in generation with the head increaser effect is as high as 21%. The estimated potential for this technology in the Amazon region is 20 GW. Other potential locations are discussed in the article. Dams with head increaser effect have been successfully implemented and have the potential to become a major alternative for base load renewable energy in the future.

ID DISCOVERY
AB Spatio-temporal periodic pattern mining is to find temporal regularities for interesting places. Many real world spatio-temporal phenomena present sequential and hierarchical nature. However, traditional spatio-temporal periodic pattern mining ignores the consideration of sequence, and fails to take into account inherent hierarchy. This paper proposes a hierarchical trajectory clustering based periodic pattern mining that overcomes the two common drawbacks from traditional approaches: hierarchical reference spots and consideration of sequence. We propose a new trajectory clustering algorithm which considers semantic spatio-temporal information such as direction, speed and time based on Traclus and present comparative experimental results with three popular clustering methods: Kernel function, Grid-based, and Traclus. We further extend the proposed trajectory clustering to hierarchical clustering with the use of the single linkage approach to generate a hierarchy of reference spots. Experimental results reveal various hierarchical periodic patterns, and demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms traditional reference spot detection algorithms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The trend of globalization has recently seen the study of distributed scheduling problems. This study attempts to solve the distributed hybrid flowshop scheduling problem with multiprocessor tasks, and is the first attempt to address this problem. To solve this strongly NP-hard problem, a mixed integer linear programming formulation and self-tuning iterated greedy (SIG) algorithm that incorporates an adaptive cocktail decoding mechanism are presented to minimize the makespan. Comprehensive computational results demonstrate that the proposed SIG algorithm is extremely efficient and effective. This paper successfully expands the research area of distributed scheduling problems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A truly autonomous artificial intelligence agent should be able to drive its own learning process. That is, decide what to explore and what to learn, identifying what constitutes potential useful data as examples of concepts or what strategy to follow to solve a new task. Different efforts have been developed in machine learning towards this aim. Approaches that introduce new concepts, like predicate invention in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) techniques, normally require the selection of examples by the user. Techniques that learn behavior policies through exploration like Reinforcement Learning (RL) with intrinsic motivation, to guide the agent into interesting areas to discover new goals, assume that all the states and actions are predefined in advance. In this paper, we describe a system, called ADC, that combines techniques from ILP with predicate invention and RL with intrinsic motivation to discover new concepts, states and actions to learn behavior policies. ADC drives its own learning process, collecting its own examples for autonomously learning concepts. These new concepts can be used to describe its environment and define new states and actions used to learn behaviors to solve tasks. We show the effectiveness of our approach in simulated robotics environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved:

AB After digitally designing components of vehicles, a design team creates a virtual manufacturing environment that resembles actual manufacturing facilities. During this digital pre-assembly process, a review team examines each component, and records its problems and requirements in part verification reports. Once these reports are delivered to specific design team responsible for each part, the design team can make appropriate adjustments to their designs. This digital pre-assembly process can evaluate and prevent flaws in design prior to actual manufacturing, improving production quality and reducing manufacturing cost. As these reports are written in free text form, they, however, are not fully utilized for understanding problems arising from the design process. This paper proposes a method of applying text mining techniques on verification reports to extract insights for quality improvement. In this paper, following three text mining approaches are proposed: (1) Extracting n-grams for text preprocessing and constructing domain ontology; (2) Extracting meaningful insights from text preprocessing; (3) Creating intuitive visual tools to understand the extracted insights. The proposed method is applied on approximately 140,000 reports, and is validated through the quality of the answers obtained for the questions posed by the domain experts. The proposed method successfully extracts useful information from the text database, and provides intuitive graphical interface, thereby satisfying the need of the domain experts. This paper proposes a systematic framework of transforming huge amount of raw text data into intuitive visualization. Through this framework, meaningful knowledge can be extracted, analyzed and shared to improve the quality of the products. Main contribution of our paper is that it proposes a framework for knowledge extraction from pre-assembly process. Not only does it systematically arrange the data, but it also combines various data sources and creates a knowledge system to improve efficiency of the design process. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We present a new bi-objective arc routing problem in which routes must be constructed in order to maximize collected profit and a non linear dispersion metric. A dispersion metric calculated based on instantaneous positions, suitable to capture routing characteristics found when vehicles have to travel in hostile environments, is a novelty in the routing literature. The inherent combinatorial nature of this problem makes it difficult to solve using exact methods. We propose a Multi-objective Genetic Local Search Algorithm to solve the problem and compare the results with those obtained by a well known multi objective evolutionary algorithm. Computational experiments were performed on a new set of benchmark instances, and the results evidence that local search plays an important role in providing good approximation sets. The proposed method can be adapted to other multi-objective problems in which the exploitation provided by local search may improve the evolutionary procedures usually adopted. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Supervised classification techniques are known to exploit physical information of the analysed data, such as similarity, distribution and other low level features. Despite the relevance of such features, recent works have showed that a higher variety of patterns can be detected by combining low level and high level features. In this paper, it is proposed a supervised classification technique which applies limiting probabilities of the random walk theory over underlying networks constructed from input labeled data. The appealing feature of the proposed approach is that the adjacency matrix which carries both physical and structural information about the data. Structural information are given by features extracted from network connections. The class of a given unlabeled sample is estimated by a heuristic called ease of access, which is measured by the random walk process over the adjacency matrix. Such approach makes the technique quite general as one can put distinct data measures of interest in the connection matrix of the underlying data network to guide the random walker. Specifically, we show examples of combining low and high level features in the proposed classification scheme. Simulation results using artificial and real data sets suggest that the proposed technique is not only competitive with current and established classification techniques, but it also can reveal intrinsic structural patterns formed by the input data.

AB This article presents an innovative research methodology that enables the efficient classification of cardiac disorders (17 classes) based on ECG signal analysis and an evolutionary-neural system.
   From a social point of view, it is extremely important to prevent heart diseases, which are the most common cause of death worldwide. According to statistical data, 50 million people are at risk for cardiac diseases worldwide. The subject of ECG signal analysis is very popular. However, due to the great difficulty of the task undertaken, and high computational complexity of existing methods, there remains substantial work to perform.
   This research collected 1000 fragments of ECG signals from the MIH-BIH Arrhythmia database for one lead, MLII, from 45 patients. An original methodology that consisted of the analysis of longer (10-s) fragments of the ECG signal was used (an average of 13 times less classifications). To enhance the characteristic features of the ECG signal, the spectral power density was estimated (using Welch's method and a discrete Fourier transform). Genetic optimization of parameters and genetic selection of features were tested. Pre-processing, normalization, feature extraction and selection, cross-validation and machine learning algorithms (SVM, kNN, PNN, and RBFNN) were used.
   The best evolutionary-neural system, based on the SVM classifier, obtained a recognition sensitivity of 17 myocardium dysfunctions at a level of 90.20% (98 errors per 1000 classifications, accuracy = 98.85%, specificity = 99.39%, time for classification of one sample = 0.0023 [s]). Against the background of the current scientific literature, these results are some of the best results to date. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Buildings are an essential part of our social life. People spend a substantial fraction of their time and spend a high amount of energy in them. There is a grand variety of systems and services related to buildings, in order to better control and monitoring, The prompt taking of decisions may prevent costs and contamination. This paper proposes a method for energy consumption forecasting in public buildings, and thus, achieve energy savings, in order to improve the energy efficiency, without affecting the comfort and wellness. The prediction of the energy consumption is indispensable for the intelligent systems operations and planning. We propose an Elman neural network for forecasting such consumption and we use a genetic algorithm to optimize the weight of the models. This paper concludes that the proposed method optimizes the energy consumption forecasting and improves results attained in previous studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the sheer number of applications that uses computer networks, in which some are crucial to users and enterprises, network management is essential. Therefore, integrity and availability of computer networks become priorities, making it a fundamental resource to be managed. In this work, a scheme combining Genetic Algorithm and a Fuzzy Logic for network anomaly detection is discussed. The Genetic Algorithm is used to generate a Digital Signature of Network Segment using Flow Analysis, where information extracted from network flows data is used to predict the networks traffic behavior for a given time interval. Furthermore, a Fuzzy Logic scheme is applied to decide whether an instance represents an anomaly or not, differing from some approaches present in the literature. Indeed, it is proposed an expert system with the capability to monitor the network's traffic with IP flows while expected behaviors are generated in a regular time interval basis, issuing alarms when a possible problem is present. The proposed anomaly detection system exposes network problems autonomously. The results acquired from applying the proposed approach in a real network traffic flows achieve an accuracy of 96.53% and false positive rate of 0.56%. Moreover, our method succeeds in achieving higher performance compared to several other approaches. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays, social microblogging services have become a popular expression platform of what people think. People use these platforms to produce content on different topics from finance, politics and sports to sociological fields in real-time. With the proliferation of social microblogging sites, the massive amount of opinion texts have become available in digital forms, thus enabling research on sentiment analysis to both deepen and broaden in different sociological fields. Previous sentiment analysis research on microblogging services generally focused on text as the unique source of information, and did not consider the social microblogging service network information. Inspired by the social network analysis research and sentiment analysis studies, we find that people's trust in a community have an important place in determining the community's sentiment polarity about a topic. When studies in the literature are examined, it is seen that trusted users in a community are actually influential users. Hence, we propose a novel sentiment analysis approach that takes into account the social network information as well. We concentrate on the effect of influential users on the sentiment polarity of a topic based microblogging community. Our approach extends the classical sentiment analysis methods, which only consider text content, by adding a novel PageRank-based influential user finding algorithm. We have carried out a comprehensive empirical study of two real-world Twitter datasets to analyze the correlation between the mood of the financial social community and the behavior of the stock exchange of Turkey, namely BIST100, using Pearson correlation coefficient method. Experimental results validate our assumptions and show that the proposed sentiment analysis method is more effective in finding topic based microblogging community's sentiment polarity.

AB This paper presents a complete review of computer vision algorithms and vision-based intelligent applications, that are developed in the field of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the latest decade. During this time, the evolution of relevant technologies for UAVs; such as component miniaturization, the increase of computational capabilities, and the evolution of computer vision techniques have allowed an important advance in the development of UAVs technologies and applications. Particularly, computer vision technologies integrated in UAVs allow to develop cutting-edge technologies to cope with aerial perception difficulties; such as visual navigation algorithms, obstacle detection and avoidance and aerial decision-making. All these expert technologies have developed a wide spectrum of application for UAVs, beyond the classic military and defense purposes. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Computer Vision are common topics in expert systems, so thanks to the recent advances in perception technologies, modern intelligent applications are developed to enhance autonomous UAV positioning, or automatic algorithms to avoid aerial collisions, among others. Then, the presented survey is based on artificial perception applications that represent important advances in the latest years in the expert system field related to the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. In this paper, the most significant advances in this field are presented, able to solve fundamental technical limitations; such as visual odometry, obstacle detection, mapping and localization, et cetera. Besides, they have been analyzed based on their capabilities and potential utility. Moreover, the applications and UAVs are divided and categorized according to different criteria.

AB This paper proposes an improved K-medoids clustering algorithm which preserves the computational efficiency and simplicity of the simple and fast K-medoids algorithm while improving its clustering performance. The proposed algorithm requires determining the candidate medoids subsets and calculating the distance matrix, then using both of them to incrementally increase the number of cluster and new medoids from 2 to K, as well as selecting two initial medoids. The Rand index, Jaccard index, Adjusted Rand index and F-measure are employed to evaluate how the proposed algorithm compares with three state-of-the-art algorithms: the simple and fast K-medoids (FastK), density peak optimized K-medoids (DPK), density peak optimized K-medoids with a new measure (DPNMK) algorithms. Experimental results on both real and artificial data sets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other three algorithms. The complexity of this proposed algorithm was analyzed and found to be lower than DPK and DPNMK, and be similar to FastK. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Improving the efficiency of methods has been a big challenge in recommender systems. It has been also important to consider the trade-off between the accuracy and the computation time in recommending the items by the recommender systems as they need to produce the recommendations accurately and meanwhile in real-time. In this regard, this research develops a new hybrid recommendation method based on Collaborative Filtering (CF) approaches. Accordingly, in this research we solve two main drawbacks of recommender systems, sparsity and scalability, using dimensionality reduction and ontology techniques. Then, we use ontology to improve the accuracy of recommendations in CF part. In the CF part, we also use a dimensionality reduction technique, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), to find the most similar items and users in each cluster of items and users which can significantly improve the scalability of the recommendation method. We evaluate the method on two real-world datasets to show its effectiveness and compare the results with the results of methods in the literature. The results showed that our method is effective in improving the sparsity and scalability problems in CF. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hesitant Fuzzy Sets (HFSs) is an important tool to deal with uncertain and vague information. There have been lots of fuzzy measures for it from different views. However, these fuzzy measures are more or less inappropriate in the applications. The distance and similarity measures only consider the closeness of the HFSs, while the correlation coefficients only consider the linear fashion. They are merely one side of the HFSs intrinsic fuzzy measures. Therefore, in this paper, we apply the grey relational analysis to the HFSs for the first time and define the HFSs grey relational degree to express the closeness. Furthermore, we creatively propose the difference and slope concept of the HFSs. Based on the difference and slope we define the HFSs slope grey relational degree to represent the linear fashion. Sequentially, combining the HFSs grey relational degree and HFSs slope grey relational degree together, we construct the HFSs synthetic grey relational degree, which takes both the closeness and the linear fashion into consideration. With the help of the proposed HFSs synthetic grey relational degree we propose the hesitant fuzzy grey relational recognition methodology. Finally, we apply the HFSs synthetic grey relational degree to deal with the pattern recognition problems. Compared with some examples, the performance of the proposed HFSs synthetic grey relational degree outperforms the existing HFSs fuzzy measures in the accuracy and integrity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Filter feeders, like mussels and clams, are suitable bioindicators of environmental pollution. These shellfish, when destined for human consumption, undergo a depuration step that aims to nullify their pathogenic microorganism load and decrease chemical contamination. Nevertheless, the lack of contamination by drugs may not be guaranteed. Antimicrobials are a class of drugs of particular concern due to the increasing phenomenon of antibiotic resistance. Their use in breeding and aquaculture is a major cause of this. We developed a multiclass method for the HPLC-MS/MS analysis of 29 antimicrobials, validated according to the Commission Decision 2002/657/UE guidelines, and applied it to 50 mussel and 50 clam samples derived from various Food and Agricultural Organisation marine zones. The results obtained, indicate a negligible presence of antibiotics. Just one clam sample showed the presence of oxytetracycline at a concentration slightly higher than the European Union Maximum residue limit set for fish. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Volatile, aroma-active, and phenolic compounds of pistachio oil obtained from cv. Uzun were investigated in the current study. To obtain a representative aromatic extract, three of the most widely used extraction methods were compared using a representative test; the solvent-assisted flavour extraction (SAFE) aromatic extract from pistachio oil was found to be the most representative. A total of 50 aroma compounds were determined in pistachio oil and it was found that terpenes, aldehydes, and alcohols were the most abundant volatile compounds. Applying GC-MS-olfactometry and aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) resulted in a total of 14 aroma-active areas being detected in the extract of pistachio oil. In the phenolic fraction obtained by the LC-ESI-MS/MS method, a total of 12 phenolic compounds was found in the pistachio oil, of which seven compounds were reported for the first time. Eriodictyol-7-O-glucoside and protocatechuic acid were the most dominant phenolic compounds. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Myosin was extracted immediately after high-pressure treatment (HP, 100-300 MPa for 15 or 180 s) to pre-rigor rabbit muscles (PRRMs) for evaluating the influences of HP-treatment on gel properties, using untreated muscles as Controls. Assessment of myosin yields, water-holding capacity (WHC), water mobility and distribution demonstrated that HP modified myosin before its extraction. Myosin gels subjected to HP at 100 MPa 180 s and 200 MPa 15 s had enhanced WHC compared with Controls. Also, the highest proportion of immobile-water was observed in myosin gels treated at 200 MPa for 15 s. HP-treatment of PRRMs affected their physicochemical properties as evidenced by alterations in tertiary, secondary conformations and rheological properties during subsequent heating. These modifications appear to induce various degrees of exposure of hydrophobic and sulfhydryl groups, resulting in different gelation rates. These alterations partly explain the various gel qualities obtained and indicate the potential of HP for pre-rigor muscles.

AB Bioactive lipids of the milk fat globule membrane become concentrated in two co-products of the butter industry, buttermilk and butterserum. Their lipid composition is detailed here with special emphasis on sphingolipid composition of nutritional interest, determined using GC, HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. Butterserum was 2.5 times more concentrated in total fat than buttermilk, with 7.7 +/- 1.5 vs 19.5 +/- 2.9 wt% and even more concentrated in polar lipids, with 1.4 +/- 0.2 vs 8.5 +/- 1.1 wt%. Both ingredients constitute concentrated sources of sphingomyelin (3.4-21 mg/g dry matter) and contained low amounts of bioactive ceramides in a ratio to sphingomyelin of 1:5 mol% in buttermilk and 1:10 mol% in butterserum. Compared to other natural lecithins, these two co-products are rich in long and saturated fatty acids (C22:0-C24:0), contain cholesterol and could have interesting applications in neonatal nutrition, but also as brain-protective, hepatoprotective and cholesterol lowering ingredients.

AB The bioaccessibility of Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Zn, and crude protein was evaluated after submitting beef, pork, and chicken to five different thermal treatments. The bioaccessibility of crude protein and metals were simulated by using in vitro enzymatic digestion with a gastric fluid solution and dialysability approach. Inductively coupled plasma optical spectrometry was used to quantify the dialyzable fraction and the total mineral content after microwave-assisted digestion. Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry quantified Cu in chicken dialyzable fraction. The increase of temperature and heat exposure period decreased the protein bioaccessibility. Considering the total and dialyzable fraction, beef is an important source of Cu, Fe, Mg, and Zn to the human diet. The results of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy indicated physical changes in the treated samples related to protein denaturation, which was probably responsible for the decreased bioaccessibility of minerals and protein, mainly at higher temperatures.

AB The versatile use of carotenoids in feed, food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries has emphasized the optimization of extraction methods to obtain the highest recovery. The choice of method for carotenoid extraction from food matrices is crucial, owing to the presence of diverse carotenoids with varied levels of polarity, and the presence of various physical and chemical barriers in the food matrices. This review highlights the theoretical aspects and recent developments of various conventional and nonconventional methods used for the extraction of carotenoids, including ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), pressurized liquid extraction (PLE), and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE). Recent applications of non-toxic and environmentally safe solvents (green solvents) and ionic liquids (IL) for carotenoid extraction are also described. Additionally, future research challenges in the context of carotenoids extractions are also identified.

Analyte concentrations were determined in the samples by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The results showed that thermal processing can affect the concentrations of the elements investigated in pulse samples. The influence of the heat treatment can range between legume species and chemical elements, as well as with the type of heat treatment, dry, wet, conductive heating and using microwaves.

AB Pistachios (Pistacia vera) exhibit an interesting nutritional value, due to the high content of oleic acid and minor components with antioxidant and bioactive properties. This work aimed to characterize pistachio virgin oils and their partially defatted residual cakes, obtained from eight cultivars (Aegina, Avdat, Kastel, Kerman, Larnaka, Mateur, Napoletana, and Sirora). Interesting results on phenolics, tocopherols and antioxidant activity were observed, which were greatly affected by variety. Pistachio virgin oils are rich in healthy oleic acid (55-74%), phytosterols (3200-7600 mg/kg) and c-tocopherol (550-720 mg/kg). A high content of phenolic compounds (8600-15000 mg/kg gallic acid equivalents) and the corresponding antioxidant activities (12-46 and 155-496 mmol/kg for DPPH and ORAC) of the residual cakes demonstrate their potential applications as functional ingredients and as rich sources of bioactive compounds. Moreover, virgin pistachio oils possess peculiar and pleasant sensory characteristics, contributing greater added value to the consumers compared to refined vegetable oils. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Prenylated phenolics from the Fabaceae are promising lead compounds for new antibacterials. Pools enriched in prenylated phenolics were made from lupine, peanut and soybean seedlings. One pool was rich in chain prenylated isoflavones (cIsf), one in chain prenylated stilbenoids (cSti), one in chain prenylated (cPta) and one in ring-closed prenylated pterocarpans (rPta), as characterized by RP-UHPLC-UV-MS. Antibacterial activity of the pools and membrane permeabilization was investigated. Pools showed high antibacterial activity against Listeria monocytogenes: cIsf pool had a minimum inhibitory concentration of 10 mu g/ml prenylated compounds, followed by cPta pool (25 mu g/ml) and cSti pool (35 mu g/ml). Activity against E. coli was found only when the pools were co-administered with an efflux pump inhibitor. The pool enriched in chain prenylated isoflavones permeabilized the bacterial membrane within minutes of exposure, whereas ampicillin did not.

AB The mechanism underlying the fragmentation of waxy maize starch (WMS) granules during highpressure homogenization (HPH) was studied and the results were interpreted in terms of granular and molecular aspects. The diameter of disrupted starch granules decreased exponentially with increasing HPH pressure, but decreased linearly with increasing of HPH cycles. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a cone-like inside-out disruption pattern through the channels that resulted in separation of blocklets fragments or starch fragments. The Mw of amylopectin was reduced by similar to half following treatment at 150 MPa with two cycles, or at 100 MPa for eight cycles, and the decrease was in accordance with the disruption of starch granules. This indicated that amylopectin was "protected" by blocklets, and the disruption of WMS granules mainly occurred close to the linkage among blocklets. Increasing the HPH pressure appeared to be more effective for breaking starch granules than increasing the number of HPH cycles. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The study presents the validation results of the method carried out for analysis of free amino acids (FAAs) in rice using L-theanine as the internal standard (IS) with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) reagent using high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection. The detection and quantification limits of the method were in the range 2-16 mu mol/kg and 3-19 mu mol/kg respectively. The method had a wide working range from 25 to 600 mu mol/kg for each individual amino acid, and good linearity with regression coefficients greater than 0.999. Precision measured in terms of repeatability and reproducibility, expressed as percentage relative standard deviation (% RSD) was below 9% for all the amino acids analyzed. The recoveries obtained after fortification at three concentration levels were in the range 75-105%. In comparison to L-norvaline, findings revealed that L-theanine is suitable as an IS and the validated method can be used for FAA determination in rice. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rhodococcus sp. B7740 is a newfound bacterium which was isolated from 25 m deep seawater in the arctic. In this paper, Rhodococcus sp. B7740 was firstly discovered to produce abundant natural isoprenoids, including ubiquinone-4(UQ-4), 13 kinds of menaquinones, three rare aromatic carotenoids and more than one common carotenoid. These compounds were identified by UV-Visible, HPLC-APCI-MS/MS and HRMS spectra. Results demonstrated that Rhodococcus sp. B7740 might be a worthy source of natural isoprenoids especially for scarce aromatic carotenoids. Among them, isorenieratene with 528.3762 Da ( calculated for 528.3756 Da, error: 1.1 ppm), a carotenoid with aromatic ring, was purified by HSCCC. The stability of isorenieratene under the mimical gastric conditions was measured compared with common dietary carotenoids, beta-carotene and lutein. Unlike beta-carotene and lutein, isorenieratene exhibited rather stable in the presence of free iron or heme iron. Its high retention rate in gastrointestinal tract after ingestion indicates the benefits for health. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Total phenolic content (TPC), individual phenolic acid and antioxidant capacity of whole grain and bran fraction 18 rices with different bran color were investigated. The levels of TPC in bound fractions were significantly higher than those in the free fractions either in the whole grains or brans. The main bound phenolic acids in white rice samples were ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, and isoferulic acid, and in pigmented rice samples were ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, and vanillic acid. The protocatechuic acid and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid were not detected in white samples. The content of gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid had significantly positive correlations with TPC and antioxidant capacity. This study found much wider diversity in the phenolics and antioxidant capacity in the whole grain and brans of rice, and will provide new opportunities to further improvement of rice with enhanced levels of the phytochemicals.

AB The purpose of the present work was to find a correlation between microencapsulation technology applied to wines and the resulting quality of the wine itself in terms of volatile composition and phenolic profile. To this aim, samples of Nero d'Avola wines produced in Sicily (Italy) were investigated in order to: i) elucidate the aromatic composition by means of HS-SPME coupled with GC-MS; ii) assess the polyphenolic content by UHPLC mass spectrometry; iii) compare the results obtained from both the screenings with those relative to the same wines that had previously been subjected to spray-drying. The results showed a marked reduction The results here obtained evidenced a marked reduction of odour active compounds in microencapsulated wines, after resolubilization in water/ethanol; when considering the total amount of volatiles, a twofold reduction was observed. Conversely, the qualitative analysis of phenolic compounds and anthocyanin-derived pigments showed no influence of the spray-drying process on these functional constituents.

AB Total fungi count (TFC) is a quality indicator of cocoa beans when unmonitored leads to quality and safety problems. Fourier transform near infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIRS) combined with chemometric algorithms like partial least square (PLS); synergy interval-PLS (Si-PLS); synergy interval-genetic algorithm-PLS (Si-GAPLS); Ant colony optimization - PLS (ACO-PLS) and competitive-adaptive reweighted sampling-PLS (CARS-PLS) was employed to predict TFC in cocoa beans neat solution. Model results were evaluated using the correlation coefficients of the prediction (Rp) and calibration (Rc); root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP), and the ratio of sample standard deviation to RMSEP (RPD). The developed models performance yielded 0.951 <= Rp <= 0.975; and 3.15 <= RPD <= 4.32. The models' prediction stability improved in the order of PLS < CARS-PLS < ACO-PLS < Si-PLS < Si-GAPLS. FT-NIRS combined with Si-GAPLS may be employed for in-situ and noninvasive quantification of TFC in cocoa beans for quality and safety monitoring.

AB Ginger, the rhizome of Zingiber officinale Roscoe, is a popular spice used in the food, beverage and confectionary industries. In this study, we report an untargeted UPLC-Q/TOF-MS-based metabolomics approach for comprehensively discriminating between ginger from two geographical locations, Ghana in West Africa and China. Forty batches of fresh ginger from both countries were discriminated using principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least squares discrimination analysis. Sixteen differential metabolites were identified between the gingers from the two geographical locations, six of which were identified as the marker compounds responsible for the discrimination. Our study highlights the essence and predictive power of metabolomics in detecting minute differences in same varieties of plants/plant samples based on the levels and composition of their metabolites.

Restricted changes were recorded in respiration rate, ripening index, and instrumental colour values in case of the coated samples as compared to the control for 20 days at 10 degrees C. Samples coated with chitosan enriched with PPE (CHE) proved to be the most effective treatment in maintaining the overall fruit quality. Ascorbic acid, total phenolics, total flavonoids contents and antioxidant activity were recorded with restricted losses of 29%, 8%, 12%, 12% (DPPH) and 9% (FRAP), respectively for CHE samples at the end of storage. A higher degree of correlation (r > 0.918) was established between various phytochemicals and AOA. PPE enriched coatings was proved efficient in maintaining the quality of guavas during 20 days of low temperature storage.

AB A slurry sampling electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometric method is proposed for the determination of trace elements such as Cu, Cr, Cd and Pb in yogurt. The main factors affecting the slurry preparation were optimized: nature and concentration of acid solution and sonication time. The analytical method was validated in-house by calibration, linearity, limits of detection and quantification, precision and accuracy test obtaining satisfactory results in all cases. The proposed method was applied for the determination of Cd, Cr, Cu and Pb in some Brazilian yogurt samples. For these samples, the concentrations ranged from 2.5 +/- 0.2 to 12.4 +/- 0.2 ng g(-1); 34 +/- 3 to 899 +/- 7 ng g(-1) ;< 8.3 to 12 +/- 1 ng g(-1); and < 35.4 to 210 +/- 16 ng g(-1) for Cd, Cu, Cr and Pb, respectively. The daily intake of Cd, Cu, Cr and Pb via consumption of these samples was estimated.

AB This study investigated the behaviour of key aroma compounds in the presence of human saliva (200 mu L) from different individuals (n = 3) submitted or not to centrifugation (whole vs clarified saliva). HS-GC results showed that human saliva strongly decreased the release of carbonyl compounds (aldehydes and ketones). This effect was dependent on i) the structure of the aroma compounds and ii) the saliva composition. Whole saliva exerted a higher effect than clarified saliva on aroma compounds. Moreover, this effect was individual-dependent and related to the total protein content and the total antioxidant capacity of saliva. HS-SPME and LLE-GC/MS analyses revealed that metabolism of the compounds by salivary enzymes was involved. This observation indicates that some aroma compounds could be metabolized in the oral cavity in an individual manner, which could have implications for aroma perception (e.g., formation of new metabolites with different odor thresholds and qualities) and/or organisms' health status (e. g., compound detoxification).

AB The effect of heat treatment (70 degrees C or 90 degrees C for 30 min) on the foaming and interfacial properties of acid and sweet whey obtained from bovine and camel fresh milk was examined. The maximum foamability and foam stability were observed for acid whey when compared to sweet whey for both milks, with higher values for the camel whey. This behavior for acid whey was explained by the proximity of the pI of whey protein (4.9-5.2), where proteins were found to carry the lowest negative charge as confirmed by the zeta potential measurements. Interfacial properties of acid camel whey and acid bovine whey were preserved at air water interface even after a heat treatment at 90 degrees C. These results confirmed the pronounced foaming and interfacial properties of acid camel whey, even if acid and sweet bovine whey exhibited the highest viscoelastic modulus after heating.

AB The effects of agar, alginate, lecithin and glycerol on the rheological properties of commercial potato puree were investigated and interpreted in terms of starch microstructural changes, and the applicability of the Cox-Merz rule was evaluated. Each additive was applied separately at two concentrations (0.5 and 1%). Microscopic observations revealed more swollen starch aggregations in lecithin and glycerol compared with those of potato puree and agar, consequently affecting the rheological properties of potato puree. All samples exhibited shear thinning non-Newtonian behaviour. Rheological measurements were strongly concentration dependent. At 0.5% concentration, additives exerted decreases in all the rheological properties of potato puree in the order of glycerol > alginate > lecithin > agar, while at 1% concentration, the order changed to glycerol > lecithin > alginate, whereas 1% agar behaved differently, increasing all rheological values. This study also showed that agar and alginate in addition to potato puree could be valuable and advantageous for further technological processes, such as 3D printing.

AB In vitro alternatives to clinical trials are used for studying human food digestion. For simulating infant digestion, only a few models, lacking physiological relevance, are available. Thanks to an extensive literature review of the in vivo infant digestive conditions, a gastrointestinal static in vitro model was developed for infants born at term and aged 28 days. The model was applied to the digestion of a commercial infant formula. Kinetics of digestion, as well as the structural evolution, were compared with those obtained while submitting the same formula to the adult international consensus protocol of in vitro static digestion. The kinetics of proteolysis and lipolysis differed according to the physiological stage resulting mainly from the reduced level of enzymes and bile salts, as well as the higher gastric pH in the infant model. This in vitro static model of infant digestion is of interest for scientists, food or pharmaceutical manufacturers.

AB To investigate the influence of oxidative modifications of G-actin on its binding ability with aroma compounds, the influence of H2O2 treatments on G-actin structure and the absorption for alcohols and aldehydes was investigated. Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to evaluate structural changes of G-actin; GC-MS was used to analyze the binding with alcohols and aldehydes. Results showed that 0-5 mM H2O2 enhanced the absorption of G-actin toward alcohols involved in the formation of hydrogen bonds by increasing a-helix and carbonyl values. 0-1 mM H2O2 caused the release of aldehydes with decreased sulfhydryl sites. 1-20 mM H2O2 increased the retention of aldehydes, due to the increased hydrophobic sites by G-actin rebuilding and aggregating. The aggregated G-actin favoured the hydrophobic interactions with aroma compounds, forming the protein-aroma compound complex, thus enhancing the resultant binding ability, as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy and GC/MS analysis.

AB In this study, reactions of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) with selected amino acids (arginine, cysteine and lysine) were investigated in HMF-amino acid (high moisture) and Coffee-amino acid (low moisture) model systems at 5, 25 and 50 degrees C. The results revealed that HMF reacted efficiently and effectively with amino acids in both high and low moisture model systems. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analyses of the reaction mixtures confirmed the formations of Michael adduct and Schiff base of HMF with amino acids. Calculated pseudo-first order reaction rate constants were in the following order; k(Cysteine) > k(Arginine) > k(Lysine) for high moisture model systems. Comparing to these rate constants, the kCysteine decreased whereas, kArginine and kLysine increased under the low moisture conditions of Coffee-amino acid model systems. The temperature dependence of the rate constants was found to obey the Arrhenius law in a temperature range of 5-50 degrees C under both low and high moisture conditions.

These hydrogels were characterized according to the zeta potential, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The results demonstrated that the resultant hydrogels were negatively charged and spherical in shape. In addition, the maximum swelling ratio was 45.66 +/- 7.62 for CS-ALG hydrogels loaded with lysozyme. The relative activity of the released lysozyme was 87.72 +/- 3.96%, indicating that CS-ALG hydrogels are promising matrices for enzyme loading and adsorption. Furthermore, a 100% bacterial clearance rate of CS/ALG loaded with lysozyme was observed to correspond to the superposition effect stimulated by CS and lysozyme, which improved the antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus compared to CS/ALG, suggesting its potential use in the food industry as well as other applications.
