AB Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an infectious viral disease that affects the main meat and dairy production animals, including cattle, sheep, goats and swine. It is readily transmissible and countries where the disease is present suffer harsh international trade restrictions on livestock products and serious economic losses. Vaccines are important tools to contain outbreaks and maintain the status of free with or without vaccination, as defined by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The efficacy of vaccines is reliant on the content and integrity of inactivated virus particles. The long-established method to quantify the viral content of vaccines along the manufacturing process and in the final product is the 140S sucrose density gradient analysis. This method has been a valuable tool for many decades. However, it requires gradient preparation for each sample, a lengthy ultracentrifugation and a manual UV reading of the gradient, rendering it highly operator dependent and almost impossible to automate. We present a method to quantify FMDV particles in vaccines and intermediate process samples that is based on separation of components by size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC) and measurement of virus by absorption at 254 nm. The method has been extensively validated; it is accurate, precise and linear. It is applicable to all FMDV strains and sample materials and has a good concordance with the 140S test. The proposed method uses off the shelf HPLC equipment and columns. It is easily automated for high throughput operation, affording a useful process analytical technology and a novel tool for control of final product by manufacturers and regulatory agencies.

AB Significant improvement has been made in the development of vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis infections since the introduction of polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines. Conventional bacterial capsular polysaccharide (PS) based conjugate vaccines require unique and expensive manufacturing facilities, complex production processes and extensive quality testing. Synthetic oligosaccharide (OS) based approach is one of the novel technologies that is being developed to simplify production of conjugate vaccines. OSs can be chemically synthesized to a desired length long enough to represent the antigenic epitopes which often present as a homogenous mixture. We prepared OSs corresponding to tetramer and octamer of N. meningitidis serogroup C (MenC) PS by organic synthesis. The MenC tetramer and octamer were further conjugated with tetanus toxoid to produce respective monovalent conjugates having the desired physico-chemical characteristics. The conjugates were evaluated in a mouse model for immunogenicity and compared with a licensed PS conjugate vaccine. Synthetic conjugates could induce anti-MenC PS IgG as well as serum bactericidal titers at levels comparable to those elicited by the licensed vaccine. The increase in length of synthetic oligomers from tetramer to octamer did not appear to increase immunogenicity. The results establish the pre-clinical proof of concept for a synthetic MenC oligosaccharide conjugate vaccine candidate. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: World Health Organization changed the recommendation for pre-exposure rabies prophylaxis from 3-dose to 2-dose regimen in 2018. Given limited data of 2-dose regimens in pediatric population, this study aimed to compare the immunogenicity between 2-dose and 3-dose pre-exposure rabies immunization.
   Methods: This study was conducted among healthy children aged 2-12 years. They were randomized to 2-dose vaccination (2D) on days 0 and 28 or 3-dose vaccination (3D) on days 0, 7, and 28. Purified Vero cell rabies vaccine (PVRV-Verorab (TM)) was administered intramuscularly. Rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) titers were measured at 3 time points: 14-day after complete vaccination, 1-year pre booster vaccination, and 7-day post-booster dose to mimic scenario of rabies exposure. RVNA titers >= 0.5 IU/ml were considered adequate antibody. T cell specific response to rabies vaccine antigen was measured using the interferon-gamma enzyme linked immunospot assay.
   Results: From September to October 2017, 107 participants (51% males), 78 in 2D group and 29 in 3D group were enrolled. Median age was 5.8 years (IQR 4.4-7.3). All participants had RVNA titers >= 0.5 IU/ml after primary vaccination [GMT 2D: 18.6 (95%Cl 15.9-21.8) and 3D: 16.3 (95%Cl 13.2-20.1 IU/ml), p = 0.35]. At 1-year prior to receiving the booster, only 80% of the children in 2D group maintained RVNA titers >= 0.51 U/ml compared to 100% of the children in 3D group (p = 0.01). However, all participants in both groups had RVNA >= 0.5 IU/ml at 7-day post booster vaccination [GMT 2D: 20.9 (95%Cl 17.4-25.3) and 3D: 22.2 (95%Cl 15.8-31.4) IU/ml (P = 0.75)]. The median number of IFN-gamma secreting cells at 7-day post-booster dose was 98 and 128 SFCs per 10(6) PBMCs in the 2D and 3D groups, respectively (P = 0.30).
   Conclusions: Two-dose primary rabies immunization provided adequate antibody at post primary vaccination and post booster. The results support 2-dose regimen of pre-exposure rabies immunization in the pediatric population. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Elderly people are a priority target group for influenza vaccination and their decision to be vaccinated might partly depend on advice received from general practitioners (GP). This study aims to investigate the association between influenza vaccine uptake in the elderly residents in the Lazio region of Italy and the demographic and professional characteristics of their GPs, taking simultaneously into account the elderly's individual characteristics.
   Methods: We used data retrieved from different administrative sources to retrospectively analyse the cohort of 1,255,657 elderly residents aged >= 65 years who were alive and registered in the regional healthcare service at the beginning of the 2016-2017 influenza vaccination campaign (1 Oct. 2016-31 Jan. 2017). We assessed influenza vaccine uptake at the end of the vaccination campaign and evaluated its association with both individual and GP-related characteristics through a multilevel Poisson regression models accounting for clustering at physician level.
   Results: Overall, vaccination coverage at the end of vaccination campaign was 50.6%. Elderly residents who were male, older, vaccinated in the previous seasons, living in smaller provinces, and spending more money for specialist medical care showed a significantly increased probability to be vaccinated. Vaccine uptake was also significantly higher in the elderly residents assisted by GPs who got master's degree more recently, assisted a relatively high proportion of elderly patients, received influenza vaccination, had a computer assistant, and were associated with other physicians.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that influenza vaccination coverage in the elderly residents of the Lazio region is still unsatisfactorily low. We identified several determinants of influenza vaccine uptake, related to both individual and GP characteristics. Understanding how GP characteristics affected influenza vaccine uptake in the elderly population might provide insight on GPs' attitudes and concerns regarding influenza vaccination, allowing the implementation of targeted evidence-based interventions to sensitise GPs and increase vaccination coverage.

AB Measles and mumps outbreaks still occur in countries that have successfully implemented universal routine immunization programs. Measles outbreaks are mostly associated to absent or incomplete vaccination, whereas for mumps outbreaks the combined effects of waning of immunity and circulating new strains are incriminated. It is therefore increasingly useful to characterize the long-lasting immunity induced by measles-, mumps, and rubella (MMR)-containing vaccines.
   In this 10-year study, 1887 healthy children aged 12-22 months, randomized to receive 1 or 2 doses of MMR-containing vaccines (Priorix or Priorix-Tetra; GSK), were included in an antibody persistence analysis. A total of 364 children in the 1-dose group received a second dose out of study according to their local vaccination schedule between Years 4 and 10 post-dose 1, and were included in a separate post hoc analysis to evaluate the effect of the second dose when given later. Anti-measles,-mumps and rubella antibody titers were measured by commercial ELISA kits (Enzygnost, Siemens) after each vaccine dose and at Years 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 post-vaccination.
   Antibodies against measles and rubella declined moderately after vaccination but remained well above the seropositivity threshold after 10 years. The anti-measles antibody titers elicited by Priorix-Tetra remained about 2-fold higher throughout the study as compared with Priorix. A second dose of MMR vaccine later in life had a minor and transient effect on anti-measles and anti-rubella waning titers. In contrast, anti-mumps antibody levels remained relatively stable over the 10-year follow-up and a second dose of MMR vaccine, given anytime over the 10-year period, had a boosting effect on anti-mumps antibody titers and seropositivity rates.
   In conclusion, 1 or 2 doses of MMR-containing vaccines given to children in their second year of life induced antibody responses against measles, mumps and rubella viruses that persisted at least up to 10 years post-vaccination.

AB To overcome the extensive polymorphism found in human Plasmodium antigens and to avoid the lengthy characterization of their 3 dimensional structure and subsequent production of the native proteins we have been concentrated in large unstructured, non-or low-polymorphic fragments present in the blood stage of P. falciparum. Three fragments derived from the 2 family-specific and constant regions of merozoite surface protein (MSP2) and PFF0165c protein were previously selected for evaluation as potential single vaccine candidates. In order to increase and optimize their potential efficacy against P. falciparum infection the 3 antigens were combined in a single DNA recombinant product (FusN) and compared its antigenicity with that of single antigens in sera of volunteers living in endemic countries. Immunogenicity of the FusN was then compared with that of the mixture of 3 antigens in 3 strains of mice. Antigen specific, affinity purified human antibodies were then tested in antibody dependent cellular inhibition and merozoite opsonization assays. In addition, the antigen specific antibody response and its association with protection from malaria infection were determined. The data collected indicate that the recombinant product is an equal or better antigen /immunogen than fragments used either alone or as a mixture for vaccination in combination with adjuvant. In addition, antibody response to FusN shows a stronger association with protection than single fragments. The use of a single construct as vaccine would drastically reduce the cost of manufacturing and development of the GMP product. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A suitable animal model of CVA16 infection is crucial in order to understand its pathogenesis and to help develop antiviral vaccines or screen therapeutic drugs. The neonatal mouse model has a short sensitivity period to CA16 infection, which is a major limitation. In this study, we demonstrate that adult (60-day-old) gerbils are susceptible to CVA16 infection at high doses (10(8.0) TCID50). A clinical isolate strain of CVA16 was inoculated intraperitoneally into adult gerbils, which subsequently developed significant clinical symptoms, including hind limb weakness, paralysis of one or both hind limbs, tremors, and eventual death from neurological disorders. Real-time RT-PCR revealed that viral loads in the spinal cord and brainstem were higher than those in other organs/tissues. Histopathological changes, such as neuronal degeneration, neuronal loss, and neuronophagia, were observed in the spinal cord, brainstem, and heart muscle, along with necrotizing myositis. Gerbils receiving both prime and boost immunizations of alum adjuvant inactivated vaccine exhibited no clinical signs of disease or mortality following challenge by CVA16, whereas 80% of control animals showed obvious clinical signs, including slowness, paralysis of one or both hind limbs, and eventual death, suggesting that the CVA16 vaccine can fully protect gerbils against CVA16 challenge. These results demonstrate that an adult gerbil model provides us with a useful tool for studying the pathogenesis and evaluating antiviral reagents of CVA16 infection. The development of this animal model would also be conducive to screening promising CVA16 vaccine candidates as well as further vaccination evaluation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Acute gastroenteritis due to Group A rotaviruses remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in children in developing countries. India introduced its indigenous rotavirus vaccine Rotavac (R) in 2016 and Himachal Pradesh (HP) the first state to launch it. The present study aimed to evaluate rotavirus strain diversity associated with AGE prior to vaccine introduction in HP. A total of 331 fecal specimens collected from diarrheic children hospitalized at RPGMC Tanda, HP between July-2014 and June-2016 were screened for RVA by EIA. Rotavirus RNA was extracted by TRIZOL method and analyzed by RNA-PAGE. G/P typing was performed using semi-nested multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR. Rotavirus was detected in 45% (n = 149/331) of diarrheic children, with highest rate observed in the 6-11 months age group (47%). Vomiting was found more frequently associated with RV-infection. Among G-types, G12 was found most prevalent (33.1%) followed by G1 (28.4%), G9 (12.2%), G2 (9.5%), G3 (3.4%) and G10 (2.7%). G4 (0.7%) strains were rarely detected. Among P-types, P[6] was the most prevalent (40.5%) followed by P[8] (29.1%) and P[4] (14.2%). Of note, genotypes G3 and 1311 1 were detected for the first time in HP. Among GIP combinations, G1 2P[6] was most prevalent (30.4%) followed by G1 P[8] (20.3%), G2P[4] (4.7%), G1 P[6] (3.4%) and G3P[8] (2.7%). Interestingly, our study observed high percentage of unusual strains (14.2%) namely G9P[4], G2P[6], G2P[8], G12P[4] and G1P[11]. The regionally common strains G3P[6], G4P[6], G9P[6], G9P[8], G10P[6], G1 OP[8] and G1 2P[8] strains were very rarely detected. Of interest, RNA migration pattern of G1 P[8] was DS-1 like and genomic heterogeneity was observed within G12P[4] strains with both long and short electropherotypes. Our study highlights rich genetic diversity with emergence of rare rotavirus strains circulating in HP and provides baseline data prior to Rotavac (R) introduction that will help to gauge the impact of the Rotavac (R) vaccine in HP.

AB Brazil introduced the 10-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV10) to the routine national immunization program (NIP) in March 2010. In 2017, we investigated the effects of PCV10 on nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine-types (VT) and non-vaccine-types (NVT) of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) among children living in Sao Paulo city. We also compared the prevalence of VT and NVT with previous carriage surveys performed in 2010 (baseline) and 2013.
   Method: The carriage survey was conducted among 531 children, aged 12 months to <24 months, recruited from public Primary Health Units during the immunization campaign, using previous surveys methodology, except for qPCR, which was performed in the 2017 survey only.
   Results: No statistical difference was found in the prevalence of Spn either by culture (59.7%) or by qPCR (61.2%). Spn carriage increased from 40.3% (baseline) to 59.7% (2017 survey) (p < 0.001). Colonization by VT isolates significantly decreased by 90.9% (19.8-1.8%) and 95.5% (19.8-0.9%) in the 2013 and 2017 surveys, respectively, compared to that at baseline. NVT isolates increased significantly by 128% (19.6-44.8%) and 185% (19.6-55.9%) in the respective post-PCV10 surveys, most led to high prevalence of serotypes 6C (27%), 15B (9.8%), 19A (9.2%), 15A (6.0%), and 16F (5.7%). In 2017, reduction in serotype 6A (4.2-0.6%, p < 0.001) and increase in serotype 19A (1.8-6.0%, p = 0.001) were found; serotype 3 isolate was not detected in the present survey. We identified the emergence of 19A isolates CC320, associated with high penicillin (MIC >= 2.0 mg/L) and cefotaxime (MIC >= 1.0 mg/L) values.
   Conclusion: After 7 years of PCV10 introduction in the NIP, colonization by VT among toddlers decreased substantially to a residual level, along with substantial serotype replacement by novel serotypes not present in any current conjugated pneumococcal vaccine and serotype 19A. The present findings can assist policy decisions in Brazil. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tuberculosis (TB) remains a tremendous global health problem, with 1/4 of the world's population infected and causing > 1 million deaths annually. Intradermal Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine given during infancy protects against severe forms of acute disease but does not prevent chronic infection or development of pulmonary TB. TB vaccine mucosal targeting potentially could induce mucosal resident immune cells with increased protective capacity against pulmonary infection and disease. Sublingual (SL) administration of vaccines may be an optimal mucosal delivery platform based on the high absorptive capacity of this mucosal surface, the extensive lymphoid tissue, and published preclinical studies demonstrating efficacy of SL vaccination against other pathogens. To this end, we performed preliminary testing of sublingual TB vaccines. Vaccination of mice with SL BCG elicited potent mycobacteria-specific T cell responses which persisted 16 weeks post-immunization. The magnitudes of the T cell responses were similarly induced after sublingual, intranasal, and subcutaneous BCG vaccination. Interestingly, serum mycobacteria-specific antibody responses and systemic recovery of BCG post vaccination were lower after SL BCG compared with systemic BCG immunization. However, more importantly, SL BCG vaccinated mice were significantly protected against an aerosolized virulent M. tuberculosis challenge (P < 0.0001 compared to unvaccinated mice). Furthermore, this protection was long-lived, persisting for 16 weeks with >1 log CFU reduction compared with naive challenged mice in both lungs and spleens (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0028, respectively). These exciting results provide strong support for further studies exploring the mechanisms of protective immunity induced by sublingual BCG vaccination. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Influenza world-wide causes significant morbidity and mortality annually, and more severe pandemics when novel strains evolve to which humans are immunologically nalve. Because of the high viral mutation rate, new vaccines must be generated based on the prevalence of circulating strains every year. New approaches to induce more broadly protective immunity are urgently needed. Previous research has demonstrated that influenza-specific T cells can provide broadly heterotypic protective immunity in both mice and humans, supporting the rationale for developing a T cell-targeted universal influenza vaccine. We used state-of-the art immunoinformatic tools to identify putative pan-HLA-DR and HLA-A2 supertype-restricted T cell epitopes highly conserved among > 50 widely diverse influenza A strains (representing hemagglutinin types 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9). We found influenza peptides that are highly conserved across influenza subtypes that were also predicted to be class I epitopes restricted by HLA-A2. These peptides were found to be immunoreactive in HLA-A2 positive but not HLA-A2 negative individuals. Class II restricted T cell epitopes that were highly conserved across influenza subtypes were identified. Human CD4(+) T cells were reactive with these conserved CD4 epitopes, and epitope expanded T cells were responsive to both H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Dendritic cell vaccines pulsed with conserved epitopes and DNA vaccines encoding these epitopes were developed and tested in HLA transgenic mice. These vaccines were highly immunogenic, and more importantly, vaccine-induced immunity was protective against both H1N1 and H3N2 influenza challenges. These results demonstrate proof-of-principle that conserved T cell epitopes expressed by widely diverse influenza strains can induce broadly protective, heterotypic influenza immunity, providing strong support for further development of universally relevant multi-epitope T cell-targeting influenza vaccines.

AB This study examined the protective efficacy of and immune response to a nasal influenza vaccine combined with a novel mucosal oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) adjuvant, CpG ODN G9.1 (G9.1), in a model of infection limited to the upper respiratory tract (URT) and a model of infection in the lower respiratory tract (LRT). Mice were nasally primed with an A/California/7/2009 (Cal7) split vaccine (X179A) plus G9.1 and were then nasally given a booster with X179A alone. When mice were challenged with either a large (infection of the LRT) or small (infection limited to the URT) volume of live Cal7 influenza virus, mice nasally given G9.1 combined with X179A had a markedly higher rate of protection against infection limited to the URT. Moreover, this group of mice promptly recovered from an infection of the LRT. When mice were subcutaneously (s.c.) given X179A as a current form of vaccination, they had no protection from an infection limited to the URT but they did recover from an infection of the LRT. The patterns of protection were closely correlated with influenza virus-specific mucosa! secretory IgA (SIgA) or serum IgG antibody (Ab) responses. Thus, SIgA Abs responses play an important role in protection from an infection limited to the URT while influenza virus-specific serum IgG Ab responses help to protect from an infection of the LRT. A finding of note is that lungs from mice nasally given G9.1 had low levels of type I IFN-associated protein- and transcription factor-specific mRNA expression. These results suggest that nasal G9.1 can be used as an effective and safe mucosal adjuvant for influenza vaccines since this nasal vaccine system elicits both mucosal SIgA and serum IgG Ab responses that provide complete protection without inducing potent inflammatory responses.

ID UNITED-STATES; CHILDREN
AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to track and describe the absolute number of vaccine administration errors and corresponding error rates over time and by patient age and vaccine type.
   Methods: Total vaccines administered to patients aged 0 through 19 years 364 days from 1/1/2006 through 12/31/2017 at a large academic health system in the Midwest United States with primary, specialty and school-based clinics, and a pediatric hospital were obtained from an electronic medical record. Vaccine administration errors over the same time period for the same patient criteria were analyzed from the health system's incident reporting system and further compared to the frequency of all incidents reported. Vaccine administration error rates were calculated. Data were analyzed by patient age, vaccine type and year administered.
   Results: Of the 1,431,206 vaccine doses given, 552 vaccine administration errors were identified (0.04%). The highest error rates occurred in children aged 2, 3, and 19 years. Vaccine types with the highest error rate were Td, rabies and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines. Overall vaccine doses given and errors reported increased over the study period. However, the increase was disproportionate, resulting in an increase in the error rate initially followed by a stabilization at the end of the study period.
   Conclusions: Vaccine administration errors are uncommon. The error rate appears to be stabilizing. Errors are more likely at ages when vaccines are not commonly given, with vaccines that have age-specific dosing and with vaccines that are given less often. This suggests more safety checks are needed for vaccines that are rarely used or given off-schedule, and manufacturers should avoid vaccines with age-specific dosing. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of influenza vaccine during pregnancy and adverse fetal outcomes. Preventing fetal death, low birth weight, small for gestational age birth and preterm birth are important potential effects of antenatal maternal influenza immunization for which there are conflicting data.
   Materials and methods: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine was conducted in South Africa from March 2011 until after the 2012 influenza season when the infants born had reached the age of 24 weeks. Mothers were administered the vaccine or placebo during pregnancy at a gestation of 20 to 36 weeks. A comparison of rates of fetal death, low birth weight, small for gestational age birth, and preterm birth, between vaccinated and placebo groups was made. Fetal outcome differences between the groups were measured using Student's t-tests, vaccine efficacy with 95% confidence intervals, and Poisson regression for incidence rates. All analyses except fetal death excluded mothers who were administered vaccine or placebo after 34 weeks gestational age.
   Results: There were 2116 HIV-uninfected pregnant women age 18 to 38 years in the trial; 2005 infants were born to mothers where vaccine or placebo had been administered >= 14 days prior to delivery, and there were 6 miscarriages and 23 stillbirths. There was no significant vaccine efficacy (with [95% confidence interval]) on fetal death (-21.2% [-150.8, 41.4]), low birth weight (-11.1% [-42.3, 12.5]), small for gestational age birth (-9.9% [-35.6, 11.01), or preterm birth (-21.3% [-60.5, 8.3]). Neither was vaccine efficacy demonstrated when the analysis was restricted to infants of mothers who were exposed to an influenza season (1832 outcomes available).
   Conclusion: We did not find a beneficial effect of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine during pregnancy on adverse fetal outcomes. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Lassa fever remains the most imported viral haemorrhagic fever in Europe and is responsible for 5000 deaths per year throughout Western Africa. There is no vaccine and treatment is often ineffective. We have developed a vaccine based on modified Vaccinia Ankara expressing the nucleoprotein from Lassa virus (MVALassaNP). This study investigated the immunogenicity (in mice) and efficacy (in guinea pigs) of the MVALassaNP vaccine as a prime/boost or single vaccination regime. ELISA and ELISpot assays confirmed humoral and T-cell immunity following both a prime and prime/boost vaccination, with the prime/boost regime producing a statistically increased response compared to a prime only vaccine (P < 0.0001). The vaccine offered protection in guinea pigs against disease manifestations after challenge with virulent Lassa virus. Clinical signs, weight loss and temperature increases were observed in all animals receiving a control MVA vaccine, after challenge with Lassa virus. In contrast, no clinical signs, fever or weight loss were observed in any of the MVALassaNP vaccinated animals demonstrating that both a single immunisation, and prime/boost regime confer protection against disease progression.
   In conclusion, the MVALassaNP vaccine candidate elicits an immune response, demonstrates efficacy against Lassa virus disease and is suitable for further preclinical and clinical development. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Global Pertussis Initiative (GPI) is an expert scientific forum that publishes consensus recommendations for pertussis monitoring, prevention, and treatment across many regions of the world. Here, we report on the regional 2017 GPI meeting on the Americas, focusing on Latin America. Information on current pertussis epidemiology, surveillance, vaccine strategies, diagnostic capabilities, disease awareness, and major local obstacles was presented by researchers from Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Pertussis outbreaks have occurred during the last decade in the majority of participant countries and have been followed by improvements in surveillance. In the countries that introduced maternal immunization during pregnancy, a reduction in the infant case fatality rate has been detected. All countries need to maintain and improve pertussis surveillance to reach primary vaccination coverage >90%. Moreover, countries without maternal immunization programs should strongly consider them.

AB Background: Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) occurs in 5-30% of individuals with herpes zoster (HZ) and is characterized by long-lasting pain. Zoster vaccine live (ZVL) is licensed for people 50 years and older to prevent HZ and PHN. This study evaluated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of ZVL against PHN.
   Methods: We conducted an open cohort study within Kaiser Permanente Northern California with continuous accrual of people as they became age-eligible for ZVL. We defined PHN using a PHN diagnosis between 90 and 365 days after an incident episode of HZ. We estimated VE against PHN using Cox regression with a calendar timeline stratified by year of birth and adjusted for sex, race, influenza vaccination, outpatient visit frequency, comorbidities, and immune compromise status.
   Results: From 2007 to 2016, 1.5 million people entered the study population and 33% received ZVL During 7.6 million person-years of follow-up, there were 62,205 HZ cases, 4150 (6.7%) of which went on to develop PHN. Overall VE for PHN was 64.8% (95% CI 61.3, 68). VE was 82.8% (95% CI 77-6, 86.7) during the first year after vaccination, 58.3% (95% CI 50.1, 65.2) during the third year, and then waned more gradually to 48-7% (95% CI 30.2, 62-3) during the eighth year. VE in persons vaccinated when aged 80 years or older was similar to VE in younger vaccinees. VE in persons vaccinated when immune compromised was similar to VE in immune competent.
   Conclusions: Overall, ZVL was 65% effective against PHN. It was effective in all age groups and provided moderate protection through 8 years. (C) 2019 Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. and the Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB MIP and CPAF from Chlamydia have been shown to be effective in inducing immune responses important in clearing chlamydial infections. This study evaluates the protection conferred by MIP and CPAF as novel vaccines in pregnant C. abortus challenged ewes. Fifty C. abortus sero-negative sheep were randomly allocated into 5 groups of 10 according to the treatment they were to receive (1) 100 mu g of MBP-MIP (2) 100 mu g CPAF (3) 50 mu g MBP-M1P and 50 mu g CPAF (4) Tris-buffer (negative control) (5) Enzovax (positive control). Booster inoculations were administered 3 weeks after primary inoculations. Blood samples were taken pre-vaccination and weekly for 5 weeks. Five months after vaccination the ewes were mated. Pregnant ewes were then challenged on day 90 of gestation. Blood samples taken at four time-points post challenge were analysed for IFN gamma levels, TNF alpha and IL-10 expression and anti-chlamydial antibody levels. Vaginal swabs, placental and foetal tissue and bacterial shedding were analysed using qPCR to quantify levels of C. abortus. Enzovax was 100% effective with no abortions occurring. The MIP/CPAF combined vaccine offered the greatest protection of the novel vaccines with 67% of ewes giving birth to one or more live lambs equating to a 50% vaccine efficacy rate. MIP and CPAF administered singly did not confer protection. Enzovax and MIP/CPAF vaccinated ewes had longer gestations and lambs with higher birth weights than negative control ewes. Aborting ewes shed higher numbers of C. abortus than ewes that had live lambs, all vaccinated ewes demonstrated lower levels of bacterial shedding than negative control ewes with Enzovax ewes shedding significantly fewer bacteria. Ewes that went on to abort had significantly higher levels of IFN gamma and IL-10 at day 35 post challenge and significantly higher levels of anti-chlamydial antibodies at 24 h post lambing compared to ewes that had live lambs.

ID VACCINATION
AB In recent years various EU/EEA countries have experienced an influx of migrants from low and middle income countries. In 2018, the "Vaccine European New Integrated Collaboration Effort (VENICE)" survey group conducted a survey among 30 EU/EEA countries to investigate immunisation policies and practices targeting irregular migrants, refugees and asylum seekers (later called "migrants" in this report). Twenty-nine countries participated in the survey. Twenty-eight countries reported having national policies targeting children/adolescent and adult migrants, however vaccinations offered to adult migrants are limited to specific conditions in seven countries. All the vaccinations included in the National Immunisation Programme (NIP) are offered to children/adolescents in 27/28 countries and to adults in 13/28 countries. In the 15 countries offering only certain vaccinations to adults, priority is given to diphtheria-tetanus, measles-mumps-rubella and polio vaccinations. Information about the vaccines given to child/adolescent migrants is recorded in 22 countries and to adult migrants in 19 countries with a large variation in recording methods found across countries. Individual and aggregated data are reportedly not shared with other centres/institutions in 13 and 15 countries, respectively. Twenty countries reported not collecting data on vaccination uptake among migrants; only three countries have these data at the national level. Procedures to guarantee migrants' access to vaccinations at the community level are available in 13 countries. In conclusion, although diversified, strategies for migrant vaccination are in place in all countries except for one, and the strategies are generally in line with international recommendations. Efforts are needed to strengthen partnerships and implement initiatives across countries of origin, transit and destination to develop and better share documentation in order to guarantee a completion of vaccination series and to avoid unnecessary re-vaccination. Development of migrant-friendly strategies to facilitate migrants' access to vaccination and collection of vaccination uptake data among migrants is needed to meet existing gaps.

AB Background: A liquid Pentavalent (DTwP-Hb-Hib) combination vaccine, developed by Human Biologicals Institute, underwent a Phase III clinical study in India. In this randomized, single blind, non-inferiority study, the immunogenicity and safety of this Investigational vaccine was compared with Pentavac SD (R) vaccine in 6-8 weeks old healthy infants.
   Methods: A total of 405 healthy infants aged 6-8 weeks old were randomized in 2:1 ratio to receive three doses of either the Investigational liquid Pentavalent (DTwP-Hb-Hib) combination vaccine or Pentavac SD (R) vaccine at four to six weelcs interval. lmmunogenicity was compared by estimation of antibody titers before the first dose and 4-6 weeks after the third dose of vaccination. Safety of each vaccine was assessed and compared by collection of data on solicited and unsolicited adverse events throughout the study period.
   Results: Out of a total of 405 enrolled subjects, 387 subjects completed the study. The seroconversion rates, seroprotection rates and geometric mean titres of the Investigational liquid Pentavalent (DTwP-Hb-Hib) combination vaccine group were found to be comparable and non-inferior to the Pentavac SD (R) vaccine group at 4-6 weeks after the third dose of vaccination. Pain, erythema and swelling at the site of injection were found to be the most common local adverse events whereas fever, irritability and unusual crying were found to be the most common systemic adverse events in both the vaccine groups. No vaccine related serious adverse event was reported. In this study, both the Investigational vaccine as well as the Comparator vaccine were found to be immunogenic and well tolerated.
   Conclusion: After assessment of the results of the study it was concluded that the Investigational liquid Pentavalent (DTwP-Hb-Hib) combination vaccine developed by Human Biologicals Institute was immunogenic and safe when administered to infants aged 6-8 weeks and was non-inferior in immunogenicity and safety to Pentavac SD (R) vaccine.

AB Mathematical models have been used to estimate the impact of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines on infection burden and cervical cancer. Models assume different mechanisms of naturally acquired immunity against re-infection, but processes of latency and reactivation of latent infection have not been explored. This study uses an individual-based dynamic model to simulate randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for vaccine efficacy, using different assumptions about naturally acquired immunity and viral latency after clearance of HPV infection. Model estimates of vaccine effectiveness are compared to those from published RCTs. We then estimate the impact of the bivalent vaccine on HPV-16 and -18 infection burden in South Africa under these different assumptions. When assuming no latency, simulated vaccine effectiveness overestimates results from RCTs and the model cannot match the observed difference in vaccine effectiveness between total vaccinated cohorts and more HPV-naive cohorts. The reduction in HPV-16 and -18 burden by 2045, following roll-out of vaccination in 2014, does not depend on assumptions about natural immunity, but models that assume no latency predict similar to 25% greater reduction in HPV-16 and -18 burden than models that include reactivation of latent infection for all men and women. Mathematical models that do not allow for reactivation of latent HPV infections may therefore overestimate the long-term impact of HPV vaccines. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was recently shown to be effective against PCV13-type invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and pneumococcal community acquired pneumonia (CAP(Spn)) in healthy adults aged >= 65 years, prompting many countries to re-assess adult immunization. In Canada, the potential benefits of adult PCV13 immunization were unclear given anticipated herd immunity from PCV13 childhood immunization introduced since 2010. This study describes the serotype distribution and clinical outcomes of Canadian adults aged >= 16 years, who were hospitalized with CAP(Spn) and IPD from 2010 to 2015.
   Methods: Active surveillance for CAP and IPD was performed in adult hospitals across five Canadian provinces. IPD was identified when Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from sterile sites. Bacteremic and non-bacteremic CAP(Spn) were identified using blood culture, and sputum culture or PCV13-specific urine antigen detection (UAD(PCV13)), respectively. Serotype was assigned using Quellung reaction, PCR, or UAD(PCV13).
   Results: Of 6687 CAP cases where a test was performed, S. pneumoniae positivity decreased from 15.9% in 2011 to 8.8% in 2014, but increased to 12.9% in 2015. CAP(Spn) attributed to PCV13 serotypes followed a similar trend, dropping from 8.3% in 2010 to 4.6% in 2014, but increasing to 6.3% in 2015. The decline was primarily attributed to serotypes 7F and 19A, and the proportional increase to serotype 3. Similar trends were noted for bacteremic and non-bacteremic CAP(Spn). Serious outcomes such as 30-day mortality, intensive care unit admission, and requirement for mechanical ventilation were prominent in CAP(Spn) and IPD cases, but remained unchanged over the study years.
   Conclusion: Herd immunity afforded primarily by serotypes 7F and 19A appears to be partly masked by a concomitant proportional increase of serotype 3. Despite evidence of herd immunity, these PCV13 serotypes remain persistent in Canadian adults hospitalized with CAP(Spn), and represent between 5 and 10% of all CAP in this patient population.

AB Background: Pertussis remains an important global public health concern, despite the presence of extensive immunization programs. Incidence and severity of pertussis are typically higher in neonates and young infants. As a strategy to protect these young infants, maternal vaccination with Tdap (tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis) has been recommended in Brazil. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of Tdap vaccination during pregnancy on the anti-pertussis toxin (PT) IgG response in mothers and their infants at birth.
   Material and methods: Maternal and cord blood samples were collected from vaccinated (n = 243) and unvaccinated (n = 75) pregnant women, at the time of delivery, from July 2015 to August 2016 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Anti-PT IgG antibodies were quantified by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and geometric mean concentrations (GMC) were calculated. Relationship between timing of vaccination and antibody concentrations were evaluated.
   Results: Maternal and cord blood GMCs among the vaccinated group were 5.4 and 5.6 fold higher [66.5 International Units (IU)/mL and 89.8 IU/mL] compared to the unvaccinated group (12.4 IU/mL and 16.1 IU/mL), respectively (p < 0.001). Higher anti-PT IgG GMCs were observed when vaccination occurred >= 60 days before delivery compared to <60 days, suggesting that vaccination early in the third trimester may be more effective than later in pregnancy.
   Conclusion: Tdap maternal vaccination results in significantly higher anti-FT IgG in newborn infants and supports the current recommendation of the Brazilian Immunization Program. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: In 2014, the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MoH) recommended Tdap to pregnant women in response to a significant increase in the incidence of pertussis among infants. The present study assessed the effectiveness of maternal immunization in preventing pertussis in infants.
   Methods: An unmatched case-control study was undertaken in Sao Paulo State, Brazil from February 2015 to July 2016. Cases were infants aged <8 weeks at onset of pertussis reported to the Surveillance System and confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction or culture. Four to six healthy infants were selected as controls per case from birth certificates in the Information System on Live Births database. General characteristics and mother's vaccination status were compared between cases and controls. The vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated as 1 - odds ratio (OR). For the adjusted VE, the OR was calculated using logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Forty-two cases and 248 controls were enrolled in the study. Mothers of 8 cases (19.1%) and 143 controls (57.4%) were vaccinated during pregnancy, resulting in an unadjusted VE of 82.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 60.8-92.3%). The VE was unchanged after adjusting for maternal age and monthly household income.
   Conclusion: Maternal pertussis vaccination during pregnancy was effective in protecting infants aged <8 weeks from pertussis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Inspired by advances in immunology, in the 1970s scientists began to study the possibilities of mobilizing the human immune system against intruders other than pathogenic viruses and bacteria. In 1972 the suggestion was first made that it might be possible to provoke immunity to narcotic dependence. Because molecules of narcotics such as heroin and cocaine are too small to stimulate an immune response, researchers sought ways of coupling them to immunogenic proteins. The substances they developed soon became known as addiction vaccines. However, despite fifty years of research, and despite the growing problem of addiction, no vaccine against heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine or nicotine addiction has yet been licensed for clinical use. This paper reviews the history of addiction vaccinology, seeks to explain the unique appeal of a vaccinological approach to addiction, and argues for broad discussion of how such vaccines should ultimately be used.

AB Affinity chromatography is among the most powerful separation techniques, achieving the finest separation with high yields even in the most challenging feed streams. Incorporating affinity chromatography in vaccine purification has long been attempted by researchers to improve unit yield and purity with the secondary goal of reducing the number of downstream process operations. Despite the success in laboratory-scale proof of concept, implementation of this technique in pilot or cGMP manufacturing has rarely been realised due to technical and economic challenges in design and manufacturing of ideal ligands as well as availability of high-productivity chromatography media. This paper reviews evolving technologies in engineered ligands and chromatography media that are encouraging companies to revisit the possible use of affinity chromatography in larger scale vaccine purification. It is postulated that commercial-scale implementation of high throughput single-use affinity chromatography can significantly simplify process architecture, improve productivity and flexibility, and reduce cost of goods.

AB Investigation of sex determination system in Eriocheir sinensis is important because of sex-dimorphism in its growth traits. However, little information about the sex-related genes in embryonic development stages were exposed. To obtain more information of sex determination in Chinese mitten crab, we performed the transcriptome analysis in embryonic development stage (fertilized egg stage, cleavage stage, blastula stage, gastrula stage and heartbeat stage) of Chinese mitten crab using nextgeneration sequencing technology. Thirty-one of 32,088 annotated unigenes were identified as sex-related genes including 16 genes involved in primary sex determination in model organisms and 8 genes of SOX family and 7 genes of DMRT gene family. Heatmap based on the RPKM value in five embryonic development stages indicated that these genes were clustered into two branches. Analysis of the differentially expressed 12 genes, including 3 genes of SOX family, 3 genes of DMRT gene family and 6 genes involved in primary sex determination in model organisms, showed significantly difference between the first three periods (fertilized egg stage-cleavage stage-blastula stage) and the last two periods (gastrula stage-heartbeat stage) and all 12 genes were up-regulated after blastula stage. In conclusion, we inferred that sex determination might be initiated after blastula stage in E. sinensis. Transcriptome analysis from embryonic development stage could provide a background information for further investigation in sex determination of Eriocheir sinensis.

AB Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic metabolic disease, with a high incidence rate in infants. We analyzed the data of molecular genetic analysis of five infants whose metabolism screening suspected MSUD and described their clinical symptoms. Further, we performed next-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing to determine the genetic causes of the disease. Bioinformatics tools were used to predict the pathogenicity of novel mutations by performing structural modeling. All the five infants showed symptoms before one year of age and had elevated plasma leucine and valine levels. Among them, four infants presented an obvious increase in the urine lactic acid level. We identified the genetic cause of the disease in four infants and analyzed the pathogenicity of six novel mutations, viz., two mutations in BCKDHA (p.Gly180Asp and p.Arg265Gln), three in BCKDHB (p.Tyr169Cys, p.Ala331Thr, and p.Gly336Ser), and one in DBT (p.Leu69Arg), using in silico analysis. We also reviewed previously reported mutations in Chinese patients and summarized their genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. Our study has confirmed or corrected the clinical diagnosis and enriched the mutation spectrum of BCKDHA, BCKDHB, and DBT. We suggest blood and urine metabolism screening combined with next generation sequencing to diagnose MSUD, especially in infants, to achieve early diagnosis and early treatment.

AB Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have considerable translational potential in a wide variety of clinical disciplines and are the cellular foundation of individualized treatments of auto-immune, cardiac, neurologic and musculoskeletal diseases and disorders. While the cellular mechanisms by which MSCs exert their biological effects remain to be ascertained, it has been hypothesized that MSCs are supportive of local tissue repair through secretion of essential growth factors. Therapeutic applications of MSCs in peripheral nerve repair have recently been reported. This review focuses on how MSCs can promote nerve regeneration by conversion into Schwann-like cells, and discusses differentiation methods including delivery and dosing of naive or differentiated MSCs, as well as in vitro and in vivo outcomes. While MSC-based therapies for nerve repair are still in early stages of development, current progress in the field provides encouragement that MSCs may have utility in the treatment of patients with peripheral nerve injury.

AB Background: Pulmonary tuberculosis caused by an intracellular pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis continues to exist as a hazardous disease to human life globally. Genetic polymorphisms regulate resistance and susceptibility to tuberculosis. The C-type lectin receptor of family 4 member E (CLEC4E) confers protection against tuberculosis in laboratory animals but its function in influencing exposure or resistance to pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in humans remains obscure.
   Aim: We conducted this research to analyze the effects or concomitance of CLEC4E gene variations with susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis in a northern Chinese population.
   Method: In this study, 202 participants with pulmonary tuberculosis and 214 controls without PTB were enrolled. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for CLEC4E on chromosome 12 were selected with a minor allele frequency of > 0.05. All the SNPs were genotyped using high resolution melting analysis-PCR.
   Results: We estimated and compared two SNPs, rs10841845 and rs10841847. From our study findings, CLEC4E rs10841845 conferred protection against the development of pulmonary TB with a P value of < 0.05 and odds ratio of < 1 for all models of genetic inheritance.
   CLEC4E rs10841847 genotypes in co-dominant, Recessive, Dominant models and alleles had a significant statistical difference between patients and controls associated with resistance against the development of PTB (P < 0.05 and OR < 1).
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that variations at rs10841845 and rs10841847 of CLEC4E genes are associated with increased individual protection against PTB.

AB Pelodera strongyloides is a generally free-living gonochoristic facultative nematode. The whole genomic sequence of P. strongyloides remains unknown but 4 small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssrRNA) gene sequences are available. This project launched a de novo transcriptome assembly with 100 bp paired-end RNA-seq reads from normal, starved and wet-plate cultured animals. Trinity assembly tool generated 104,634 transcript contigs with N50 contig being 2195 bp and average contig length at 1103 bp. Transcriptome BLASTX matching results of five nematodes (C. elegans, Strongyloides stercoralis, Necator americanus, Trichuris trichiura, and Pristionchus pacificus) were consistent with their evolutionary relationships. Sixteen genes were identified to be homologous to key elements of the C. elegans RNA interference system, such as Dicer, Argonaute, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and double strand RNA transport proteins. In starved samples, we observed up-regulation of cuticle related genes and 3 dauer formation genes. Dauer morphology was captured with enlarged phasmid under light microscopy, and dauer and normal larvae counts in clumps had a Pearson's product-moment correlation of 0.805 with P-value = 0.0088. Our results demonstrate that P. strongyloides could be used for studying nematode-related human or pet parasitic diseases. The sequenced assembled transcriptome reported here may be useful to understand the evolution of parasitism in Nematoda.

AB Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to contribute to malignant progression in melanoma. However, the roles and mechanisms of several miRNAs in melanoma remain poorly understood. In our study, we showed that miR-10b was significantly up-regulated in melanoma tissues and cell lines, and was associated with overall survival of melanoma patients. Inhibition of miR-10b dramatically suppressed melanoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, we defined ITCH as a direct and functional downstream target of miR-10b, and showed that there was an inverse correlation between the expression of ITCH and miR-10b on melanoma tissues. Down-regulation of ITCH partially attenuated the inhibitory effects of miR-10b inhibition on melanoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore , we found that miR-10b exerted its effects on melanoma by regulating the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Taken together, our results demonstrated that miR-10b was an important epigenetic modifier, promoting melanoma progression through regulating ITCH/Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. These results offer a new strategy for epigenetic cancer therapy.

AB We evaluated microsatellite instability (MSI) in selected mismatch repair (MMR) and tumor suppressor (TS) genes with a view to exploring genetic changes associated with the occurrence of gastric cancer (GC). Moreover, expression of MSI positive genes was measured to get insights into molecular events operating in the tumor microenvironment. We anticipated discovering new molecular targets with potential as molecular biomarkers of gastric cancer. Of the 13 genes screened, we observed 15% to 52.5% MSI at eight microsatellite loci located in 3' UTR and coding regions of six genes (TGFBR2, PDCD4, MLH3, DLC1, MSH6, and MSH3). The union probability of different combinations of unstable microsatellite loci unveiled a set of four MSI markers from TGFBR2, PDCD4, MLH3, and MSH3 genes that allows detection of up to 85% incidences of GC. Significant downregulation of MLH3, PDCD4, TGFBR2, and DLC1 genes was observed in tumor tissues. Protein structure analyses of two unexplored targets, MSH3 (TG(4)) and MSH6 (A(7)), with MSI in the coding region, exhibited the loss of essential domains in the encoded aberrant protein hampering its function in the MMR machinery. The molecular markers thus identified could potentially be used as MSI biomarkers for the diagnosis of gastric tumorigenesis after further validation.

AB Mitochondrial DNA is typically passed to offspring through maternal inheritance. However, in mussels, two kinds of mitochondrial DNA exist: F and M type, which are referred to as doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI). Studies have shown that DUI may be related to gender determination. In this study, we obtained the first complete F-type mitochondrial genome of Lamprotula scripta and Lamprotula caveata which were 16,250 bp and 16,641 bp in length, respectively, and had 13 protein coding genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNAs, 2 ribosomal RNAs and 27 non-coding (NC) regions. The largest NC region of L. scripta was 639 bp and located between ND5 and tRNA(Gln). The largest NC of L. caveata was 1046 bp and also located between ND5 and tRNA(Gln). The overall AT content of L. scripta and L. caveata was 58.95% and 58.66%, respectively, which were lower than Lamprotula leaf, Lamprotula gottschei and Lamprotula tortuosa. We next compared F and M mitochondrial genomic data on freshwater mussels and established a phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequences of 13 PCGs and CM gene. Our results showed that F- and M-type mitochondria were significantly separated into two branches, and the basic structure of phylogenetic trees were divided into four distinct groups: Unioninae, Anodontini, Gonideinae and Ambleminae. Relatives of Gonideinae and Ambleminae were more closely related than Unioninae and Anodontini, indicating significant differences in mtDNA between the two mitogenome types. Moreover, we revealed that L. scripta and L. caveata are closely relatives, suggesting that they are both subordinates of the Gonideinae subfamily. Consequently, we speculate that the formation of DUI hinders their disappearance, which provides a basis for further studies into the mechanisms and genetic diversities of DUI formation.

AB Despite its history as a developmental and evolutionary model organism, gene expression analysis in the large milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus, has rarely been explored using quantitative real-time PCR. The strength of this method depends greatly on the endogenous controls used for normalization, which are lacking for the milkweed bug system. Here, to fill in this gap in our knowledge, we validated the stability of a set of ten candidate reference genes identified from the O. fasciatus transcriptome, and did so upon exposure to a dietary toxin, a cardiac glycoside, and across four different exposure periods. To increase robustness against gDNA contaminants, genome resources were used to design intron-bridging primers. A comprehensive stability validation by the Bestkeeper, Normfinder, geNorm and comparative Delta Ct methods identified ef1a and tubulin as the most stable genes across treatments and time points, whereas 18S rRNA was the most unstable. However, accounting for the temporal scale indicated that time point confined normalizers might enable higher quantification accuracy for treatment comparison. Overall this study demonstrates: (i) a robust RT-qPCR primer design approach is possible for non-model organisms where genome annotation is often incomplete, and (ii) the importance of detailed reference gene stability exploration in multifactorial experimental designs.

AB Small Tail Han Sheep are an excellent local sheep breed in China, and their outstanding reproductive performance is one of their very important biological characteristics. Clarifying the ovary development process of these ewes should provide a theoretical basis for improving their reproductive efficiency. In this study, we identified the differentially expressed (DE) microRNAs (miRNAs) in 2-, 6-, and 12-month-old small-tail Han sheep ovaries by constructing and analyzing the miRNA expression profiles. These findings clarify the molecular mechanisms regulating the excellent reproductive performance of small-tail Han ewes. We used RNA-Seq technology and bioinformatic to analyze these profiles. Eleven, 13, and 19 DE miRNAs were identified in the 2- vs 6-, 6- vs 12-, and 2- vs 12-month-old ovaries, respectively. In total, 54, 37, and 198 predicted target genes of these DE miRNAs were identified in these three groups, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses showed that in the 2- vs 6-month-old ovaries, the target genes of DE known sheep miRNAs were involved in 102 GO terms and seven signaling pathways; in the 6- vs 12-month-old ovaries, the target genes of DE known sheep miRNAs were involved in 52 GO terms and three signaling pathways; and in the 2- vs 12-month-old ovaries, the target genes of DE known sheep miRNAs were involved in 88 GO terms and six signaling pathways. Three miRNA-target regulatory networks were constructed based on these DE miRNA-target interactions. Nine miRNAs were selected to confirm to the accuracy of the miRNA sequencing data with qRT-PCR. The site at which oar-miR-432 binds RPS6KA1 was determined with a dual-luciferase system. This is the first integrated analysis the expression profiles of miRNAs and their targets during ovarian development in small-tail Han sheep. These data clarify the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying sheep ovarian development and identify biomarkers that influence the reproductive performance of small-tail Han ewes.

AB Background: Chronic inflammatory microenvironment has been shown to play a key role in initiating tumorigenesis and facilitating malignant progression. Primary tumors surrounded with and infiltrated by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) significantly promote the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and distant metastasis in urothelial bladder cancer.
   Methods: In this study, we aimed to explore the potential of targeting TAMs for the treatment of malignant bladder cancer.
   Results: First, we found a higher number of TAMs, CD68 (pan-macrophage marker), and clever-1 (M2 macrophage marker) was associated with a higher pT category and grade in a cohort of 108 patients. In vitro assays showed that the co-culture of TAMs promoted the metastatic potential in HTB-1 and T24 by up-regulating EMT markers including Snail, VEGF and Vimentin, as well as oncogenic markers such as beta-catenin and NF-kappa B. More importantly, M2 co-cultured HTB-1 and T24 showed an increased level of metastatic microRNA, miR-30. Silencing of miR-30 resulted in the reduced metastatic potential, migration/invasion, in association with the decreased expression of Twist1 and Vimentin. The addition of BAY11-7082 into the TAM/cancer co-culture system significantly reduced the M2 phenotype and tumorigenic properties. Coincidentally, miR-30a level was significantly lowered in the presence of BAY11-7082.
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that AMs promoted metastatic potential of bladder cancer cells via promoting EMT through the increase of miR-30a. BAY11-7082 treatment suppressed both oncogenic and metastatic potential in bladder cancer cells while preventing the M2 polarization of TAMs.

AB The present study was carried out to investigate the role of lncRNA TP73-AS1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We found that TP73-AS1 was upregulated in tumor tissues than in non-tumor tissues of NSCLC patients, and high expression levels of TP73-AS1 predicted poor survival. MiR-21 was also upregulated in tumor tissues and positively correlated with TP73-AS1. TP73-AS1 overexpression led to miR-21 upregulation, while miR-21 overexpression failed to affect TP73-AS1. TP73-AS1 and miR-21 overexpression caused the accelerated invasion and migration of NSCLC cells. However, TP73-AS1 overexpression failed to affect cell proliferation. Therefore, TP73-AS1 may upregulate miR-21 to promote NSCLC cell migration and invasion.

AB Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) symbolizes the predominant program of advanced-stage cancer, it is critical in cancer progression, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance. In this study, the metastatic properties of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells were evaluated by morphological examination, wound healing assay, migration and invasion assay. Western blotting and qRT-PCR were used to ascertain the expression of markers which were associated with EMT. The effects of miR-205-5p on invasion, migration, EMT and proliferation of NPC cells were evaluated and the molecular mechanisms of their interaction were explored. In this study, we manifested firstly that the expression of miR-205-5p in cisplatin-resistant NPC cell line HNE1/DDP was obviously up-regulated than that in its parental cell line HNE1. Then we analyzed the specific role of miR-205-5p through functional assays by transfecting specific mimics and inhibitors. The results indicated that low expression of miR-205-5p restrained EMT progression of HNE1/DDP cells. Further studies on the mechanism of miR-205-5p manifested that PTEN was a downstream candidate gene of miR-205-5p, down-regulated PTEN expression could counteract the effect of miR-205-5p inhibitors, and the regulation of EMT by miR-205-5p on HNE1/DDP cells depended on the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Overall, our results indicated that miR-205-5p was targeting PTEN to regulate EMT through the PI3K/AKT pathway. This study will supply a new treatment target for advanced NPC.

AB Mastitis impairs animal health and results in economic loss. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) may cause immune response and inflammation in the bovine mammary gland. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is the third gasotransmitter that acts as an anti-inflammation regulator in many cells. Despite the importance of H2S in regulating inflammation, the effect and mechanism of exogenous H2S on LPS-induced inflammation in bovine mammary epithelial cells are unknown. In the present study, with NaHS as a donor of H2S, the bovine mammary epithelial cell line (MACT) was applied as an in vitro model to study the role of H2S on LPS-induced MAC-T cells. The results verified that the cell viability was diminished by LPS but restored by exogenous H2S at a physiologically relevant concentration (10 mu M). Additionally, the production of H2S was mitigated in the LPS-induced MAC-T cells. Meanwhile, exogenous H2S decreased the intracellular ROS production and mRNA expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-8, and IL-6. Furthermore, exogenous H2S inhibited the mRNA expression of TLR4 and activation of NF-kappa B signaling pathway. In summary, exogenous H2S exerts anti-inflammatory effects through attenuating oxidative stress and blocking the TLR4/NF-kappa B pathway in the LPS-induced bovine mammary epithelial cells. Our findings might clarify new prophylactic approaches for mastitis.

AB Purpose: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality globally. This work aimed to investigate the specific modules and feature genes associated with CAD.
   Methods: Three microarray datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, which included CAD and healthy samples. WGCNA was applied to identify highly preserved modules across the three datasets. MetaDE method was used to select differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with significant consistency. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the overlapping genes amongst the DEGs with significant consistency and in the preserved modules. Moreover, a combined machine learning of support vector machine and recursive feature elimination was used to further investigate the feature genes and pathways.
   Results: Nine highly preserved modules were detected in the WGCNA network, and 961 DEGs with significant consistency across the three datasets were selected using the metaDE method. A PPI network was constructed with the 158 overlapping genes. Ten genes were found to be involved in these KEGG pathways directly, including genes CD22, CD79B, CD81, CR1, IKBKE, MAP3K3, MAPK14, MMP9, NCF4, and SPP1.
   Conclusions: The present work might provide novel insight into the underlying molecular mechanism of CAD.

AB As a fundamental regulator of mitochondrial function, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PPARGC1A) acts as a powerful coactivator of many transcriptional factors that relate to steroidogenesis, while the regulatory mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, testosterone secretion of goat Leydig cells (LCs) mediated by miR-1197-3p via PPARGC1A was investigated. We found PPARGC1A protein was diversely localized in testis, and the expression of PPARGC1A in testis of 9-month-old goat was significantly higher than that in 3-month-old goat. In addition, suppression of PPARGC1A significantly decreased the testosterone secretion in goat LCs, as well as reduced the expressions of key steroidogenesis related genes [steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily A member 1 (CYP11A1), and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3BHSD)], and overexpression of PPARGC1A showed the opposite effects. Moreover, we observed suppression of miR-1197-3p increased the synthesis of testosterone and promoted the expressions of PPARGC1A, StAR, CYP11A1, and 3BHSD by directly targeting PPARGC1A in the LCs. Furthermore, overexpression of PPARGC1A could alleviate miR-1197-3p induced aberrant steroidogenesis related gene expressions and testosterone synthesis. Taken together, miR-1197-3p could act as an essential regulator of LC testosterone secretion in goat testis by targeting PPARGC1A. These results provide a novel view of the regulatory mechanisms involved in male sexual maturation and help us to understand the molecular role of PPARGC1A in testosterone synthesis.

AB LncRNA GAS8-AS1 inhibits thyroid carcinoma, while its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) is unknown. In the present study we found that plasma GAS8-AS1 was upregulated in early stage CRC patients, and downregulation of GAS8-AS1 effectively distinguished CRC patients from healthy controls. LncRNA AFAP1-AS1 was upregulated in CRC patients and was inversely correlated with GAS8-AS1 only in CRC patients but not in healthy controls. GAS8-AS1 overexpression mediated the downregulation of AFAP1-AS1 in colon cancer cells, while AFAP1-AS1 overexpression did not significantly affect GAS8-AS1 expression. Expression level of GAS8-AS1 decreased, while expression level of AFAP1-AS1 increased with the increase of primary tumor diameters. GAS8-AS1 overexpression led to inhibited, while AFAP1-AS1 overexpression led to promoted proliferation of CRC cells, and AFAP1-AS1 overexpression reduced the inhibitory effects of GAS8-AS1 overexpression on cancer cell proliferation. Therefore, GAS8-AS may inhibit CRC cell proliferation by downregulating AFAP1-AS1.

AB Aim: The present study was conducted to analyze the relationship between c-reactive protein (CRP) gene +1444C/T, 3407T/C (rs2808630) polymorphisms and colorectal cancer susceptibility.
   Methods: A total of 142 colorectal cancer patients and 127 healthy controls were recruited into this case-control study. The genotypes of CRP gene + 1444C/T, rs2808630 polymorphisms were tested by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and the genotypes distributions of polymorphisms in controls was assessed whether conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The calculation of odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) is used for evaluating the association strength of gene polymorphism and disease.
   Results: Through the testing of chi(2), the genotypes distributions were consistent with HWE in the control group. We identified that only CC genotype frequency in CRP rs2808630 had a significant difference in cases and controls (P = 0.03) and people who carried CC genotype had a low risk suffering from colorectal cancer, compared with TT genotype carriers (OR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.14-0.90). However, the other genotypes in rs2808630 and even the genotypes CRP + 1444C/T polymorphism were all not associated with the generation of colorectal cancer.
   Conclusion: CRP rs2808630 polymorphism was related to the decreased risk of colorectal cancer, but not + 1444C/T polymorphism.

AB qRT-PCR requires reliable internal control genes stably expressed in different samples and experimental conditions. The stability of reference genes is rarely tested experimentally, especially in developing tissues given the singularity of these samples. Here we evaluated the suitability of a set of reference genes (Actb, Gapdh, Tbp, Pgk1 and Sdha) using samples from early mouse embryo tissues that are widely used in research (somites, prosencephalon and heart) at different developmental stages. The comparative Delta Cq method and five software packages (NormFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper, DataAssist and RefFinder) were used to rank the most stable genes while GenEx and GeNorm programs determined the optimal total number of reference genes for a reliable normalization. The ranking of most reliable reference genes was different for each tissue evaluated: (1) in somite from embryos with 16-18 somite pairs stage, the combination of Pgk1 and Actb provided the best normalization and Actb also presented high stability levels at an earlier developmental stage; (2) Gapdh is the most stable gene in prosencephalon in the two developmental stages tested; and (3) in heart samples, Sdha, Gapdh and Actb were the best combination for qPCR normalization. The analysis of these three tissues simultaneously indicated the combination of Gapdh, Actb and Tbp as the most reliable internal control. This study highlights the importance of appropriate reference genes according to the cell type and/or tissue of interest. The data here described can be applied in future research using mouse embryos as a model for mammalian development.

AB Heart fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) belongs to a family of intracellular fatty acid-binding proteins that are involved in the transport of long-chain fatty acids. Previous studies have indicated that H-FABP is significantly associated with intramuscular fat (IMF) content in pig. In this study, we compared the mRNA and protein expression of H-FABP between Tibetan pig (with high IMF) and Large White pig (with low IMF). The expression of H-FABP at both mRNA and protein levels in the tissues of backfat, longissimus dorsi muscle and liver was found to be significantly higher in TP than in LW. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a 2 kb region upstream of the start codon of the gene were screened using Sanger sequencing. We accordingly identified three SNPs (C-1375G, C-314T and T-158G) between the TP and LW populations and genotyped these based on PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCF-RFLPs) analysis. The results showed that the C-1375G site might regulate H-FABP gene expression and thus be associated with fat deposition in pigs. Our study provides important data for further investigating the regulatory mechanism of H-FABP for fat deposition in pigs.

AB The glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) gene family plays a major role in glycerol synthesis and adaptation to abiotic stresses. Few studies on GPD family genes from the halotolerant algae Dunaliella salina are available. In this study, seven DsaGPD genes were identified by mining D. salina sequencing data. Among them, DsaGPD5 contained the canonical NAD(+)-GPD protein domain, called si-GPD. In comparison, DsaGPD1-4 not only contained the canonical NAD(+)-GPD domain but also a unique domain, the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like superfamily domain, in their N-terminal region, called bi-GPD. DsaGPD6, 7 contained the FAD(+)-GPD domain. In the transient expression system, DsaGPD1, 3, 4 were found in the cytosol of Arabidopsis thaliana protoplast, DsaGPD2, 5 in the chloroplast, and DsaGPD6, 7 in the mitochondria. MEME analysis showed that six conserved motifs were present in both si-GPDs and bi-GPDs, whereas seven highly conserved motifs were only present in bi-GPDs. The quantitative real-time PCR results showed significant induction of the DsaGPD genes under abiotic stresses, indicating their tolerance-related role in D. salina. DsaGPD2 and DsaGPD5 may be the osmoregulator form and glyceride form in the chloroplast, respectively. The evolutionary forces acting on si-GPDs and bi-GPDs were different in the same organism: bi-GPDs were under purifying selection, while si-GPDs were mainly under positive selection. Furthermore, evolution of the N_HAD domain and C_GPD domain in bi-GPDs is highly correlated. In summary, this study characterizes DsaGPD gene family members and provides useful information for elucidating the salt tolerance mechanism in D. salina.

TI Circular RNA circ KMT2E is up-regulated in diabetic cataract lenses and

AB Covalently closed, single-stranded circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of newly discovered endogenous RNAs involved in the pathological process of various types of diseases through sponging microRNAs (miRNAs). However, the role of circRNAs in diabetic cataract (DC) is unclear. Our previous studies have demonstrated that miR-204-5p was expressed more lowly in DC than the normal controls, but whether it relates to the sponge function of circRNAs remains unknown. This study aimed to identify differentially expressed circRNAs in DC tissues and investigate the interaction between circRNAs and miR-204-5p in the development of cataract. RNA-sequencing based circRNA expression profiling was determined in DC lens tissues as well as transparent lens tissues, and 1063 circRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in the DC group compared to the normal control group (p <= 0.05, fold change >= 2.0). Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were applied to predict the function of these differentially expressed circRNAs, and the top ten enriched GO entries and KEGG pathways were annotated. Expression levels of the two candidate circRNAs having conserved interaction with miR-204-5p were validated by qRT-PCR, showing that the change direction of these circRNAs was consistent with the RNA-sequencing data. Moreover, circKMT2E was upregulated more than two folds in DC lens tissues compared with normal tissues, exhibiting an expression trend opposite to miR-204-5p. Bio-informatics analysis showed that there were totally four seed sequences of circKMT2E on hsa-miR-204-5p. Thus, we speculated that circKMT2E may function as a sponge molecule of miR204-5p and play a role in the pathogenesis of DC. Although the exact mechanisms need further validation, our study found that the differentially expressed circRNAs was involved in the pathogenesis of DC, which can provide a new target for non-surgical treatment of DC.

AB In order to improve the therapeutic effect of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), it is critical to combine radiation and gene therapy. Our study found that the activation of microRNA-9 (miR-9) conferred ionizing radiation (IR) sensitivity in cancer cells. Furthermore, increased microRNA-9 promoter methylation level was observed after IR. Our study combined the IR and microRNA-9 overexpression treatment which leads to a significant enhancement in the therapeutic efficiency in lung cancer both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, it is plausible that microRNA-9 can be used as a novel therapeutic strategy of NSCLC. MTT assay was performed to detect the effect of microRNA-9 on the survival and growth of NSCLC cells. Flow cytometry results showed that microRNA-9 enhanced the apoptosis of NSCLC cells. Wound healing assay found that microRNA-9 can inhibit the migration of NSCLC cells and enhance the effect of radiation on the migration of NSCLC cells. In addition, bisulfate sequencing PCR was performed to analyze the methylation status of the microRNA-9 promoter. In order to determine the effect of microRNA-9 and its promoter methylation status on proliferation and radio-sensitivity in vivo, a subcutaneous tumor formation assay in nude mice was performed. Results have shown that microRNA9 overexpression increased the radiosensitivity of A549 cells by inhibiting cell activity and migration, and by increasing apoptosis. In addition, the promoter methylation status of the microRNA-9 gene increased in response to ionizing radiation. Our study demonstrated that microRNA-9 enhanced radiosensitivity in NSCLC and this effect is highly regulated by its promoter methylation status. These results will help to clarify regulatory mechanisms of radiation resistance thus stimulate new methods for improving radiotherapy for NSCLC.

AB EMT (Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition) is one of the factors in the pathogenesis of adenomyosis. FMNL2 induced invasion of cancer cell through promoting EMT, but it is unclear the role of FMNL2 in the adenomyosis. By IHC staining, we found the expression level of FMNL2 was significantly higher in the ectopic endometrial stromal cells from women with adenomyosis when compared with normal endometrial stromal cells. Knockdown of FMNL2 inhibited the invasion and migration of ectopic endometrial stromal cells and promoted the protein levels of E-cadherin and Vimentin. Meanwhile, inhibition of FMNL2 could induce the cell membrane localization of E-cadherin. Our findings reveal that the aberrant activation of FMNL2 promotes the pathogenesis of adenomyosis through inducing the EMT process. On the contrary, inhibition of FMNL2 promotes the transition of ectopic endometrial stromal cells to epithelial cells in adenomyosis through a MET-like process.

AB Accumulative researches have demonstrated the critical functions of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the progression of malignant tumors, including bladder cancer (BC). Our previous studies showed that lnc-DILC was an important tumor suppressor gene in both liver cancer and colorectal cancer. However, the role of lnc-DILC in BC remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we for first found that lnc-DILC was downregulated in human bladder cancer tissues. Lnc-DILC overexpression suppressed the proliferation, metastasis and expansion of bladder cancer stem cells (CSCs). Mechanically, lnc-DILC suppressed BC cells progression via STAT3 pathway. Special STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 diminished the discrepancy of growth, metastasis and self-renewal ability between lnc-DILC-overexpression BC cells and their control cells, which further confirmed that STAT3 was acquired for lnc-DEC-disrupted BC cell growth, metastasis and self-renewal. Taken together, our results suggest that lnc-DILC is a novel bladder tumor suppressor and indicate that lnc-DILC inhibits BC progression via inactivating STAT3 signaling.

AB Estrogen regulates bone homeostasis and has a cardio-protective effect. Its physiological functions are mediated through receptors (ER) whose expression can be regulated by presence or absence of polymorphisms. However, the association between ER polymorphisms and BMD as well as lipids are inconsistent. The aim of the study was to investigate whether polymorphisms in ESR are associated with bone mineral density (BMD) and lipids in a cohort of Indian women. We studied Pvull, Xbal polymorphisms in ESR1 and AM, Rsnl polymorphisms in ESR2 genes and their association with bone mineral density (BMD) and lipids in premenopausal (n = 293, mean age: 33.01 +/- 5.23 years) and postmenopausal (n = 145, mean age: 56.91 +/- 7.1 years) women from Northeast India. AluI and RsaI polymorphisms in ESR2 gene were associated with BMD in postmenopausal women. Logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, BMI, tobacco and alcohol consumption revealed that xx genotype in Xbal polymorphism is associated with osteopenia at spine (OR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.067-10.204) in postmenopausal women suggesting that allele X is protective (OR = 0.419, 95% CI = 0.177-0.991). Genotype as in AluI polymorphism, seemed to be protective (OR = 0.092 for osteopenia; OR = 0.152 for osteoporosis) at spine whereas A allele was associated with osteopenia at femur (OR = 2.123, 95% CI = 1.079-4.166) in postmenopausal women. Allele r of RsaI polymorphism, was associated with osteoporosis at spine (OR = 3.222, 95% CI = 1.302-7.96). Thus, AluI polymorphism of ESR2 gene was associated with spinal and femoral BMD whereas RsaI only with spinal BMD in postmenopausal women and ESR genotypes were not associated with lipids.

AB Low temperature is a key stress factor for the growth and development of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and glycometabolism plays an important role in plant cold tolerance. Our previous study identified trehalose 6-phosphate synthase 11 gene (TaTPS11), which had a significantly different expression pattern between a high freezing-tolerant wheat cultivar and a low freezing-tolerant wheat cultivar. In this study, TaTPS11 was isolated from a winter-hardy wheat cultivar (D1) and overexpressed in Arabidopsis thaliana to study its effect on cold tolerance in plants. Transgenic plants expressing TaTPS11 had lower sucrose content, higher starch content, and higher activity of key enzyme (sucrose phosphate synthase, sucrose synthase, and invertase) involved in sucrose metabolism. In addition, the expression level of sucrose non-fermenting 1-related kinase 1 (SnRK1), which catalyzes the sucrose in plants, increased in the TaTPS11-overexpressed plants. These results indicated that heterologous expression of TaTPS11 influenced carbohydrate metabolism in Arabidopsis plants. The resultant plants had a significantly higher survival rate after - 5 degrees C treatment for 2 h and exhibited enhanced cold tolerance without unfavorable phenotypes compared to wild-type. Our findings indicated that manipulation of TaTPS11 improved cold tolerance in plants and TaTPS11 had potential values in wheat cold-tolerance breeding.

AB Alterations in the global gene expression profile are considered to contribute to the various physiological and pathological changes during the course of ageing. Genes that code for the molecular components of the innate system are alter markedly as ageing occurs; and this may define the susceptibility of very young and very old individuals to reproductive tract infections. The expression pattern of genes that code for beta-defensins (effectors of innate immune response) in male reproductive tract tissues of different stages of ageing is not yet reported. Further, the induction of beta-defensins during endotoxin challenge and whether epigenetic modulators can influence the expression of these genes in different stages of ageing are not reported. We analyzed the basal mRNA levels of beta-defensins and defensin-like proteins (Sperm Associated Antigen 11 (SPAG11) family members), their induction during endotoxin challenge and modulation by epigenetic modifiers (Trichostatin A and Azacytidine) in the caput, cauda, testis, prostate and seminal vesicle of rats that represent early stage to late stages of life (20 day to 730 day old). We observed differential basal gene expression pattern in the male reproductive tract tissues and the induction by LPS was not consistent neither among the age groups not the tissues analyzed. Trichostatin A and Azacytidine also influenced antimicrobial gene expression and the pattern was not consistent in different tissues obtained from different age groups. Results of this study demonstrate that antimicrobial gene expression varies to a great extent during ageing and is strongly influenced by endotoxins and epigenetic modulators.

TI miR-454-3p exerts tumor-suppressive functions by down-regulation of

AB Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and malignant primary brain tumor. Numerous studies have demonstrated that aberrant microRNAs (miRNAs) expression is involved in various pathogenesis events in GBM. miR-454-3p has been found to be downregulated in GBM, however, the role and underlying mechanism has not been fully investigated. The expression levels of miR-454-3p in GBM clinical tissues and cultured cell lines were measured by qRT-PCR. To evaluate the role of miR-454-3p in GBM, GBM cells were transfected with miR-454-3p inhibitor (anti-miR-454-3p)/control inhibitor (anti-miR-NC) or miR-454-3p mimic/control mimic (miR-NC). Online prediction algorithm Targetscan was used to predict the target genes of miR-454-3p. The dual luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to confirm whether nuclear factor of activated T cells c2 (NFATc2) was a direct biological target of miR-454-3p. We found that miR-454-3p expression was significantly decreased in both GBM tissues and cultured cell lines. Overexpression of miR-454-3p by transfection with miR-454-3p mimic suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis of GBM cells. Nuclear factor of activated T cells c2 (NFATc2) was predicted as a target gene of miR-454-3p. We found that NFATc2 expression was significantly increased in both GBM tissues and cultured cell lines. Besides, expression levels of miR-454-3p were negatively associated with NFATc2 expression in GBM tissues. NFATc2 knockdown in GBM cells obviously inhibited cell proliferation and elevated apoptosis. Luciferase reporter assay revealed that NFATc2 was a target gene of miR-454-3p. miR-454-3p overexpression suppressed the NFATc2 expression, while inhibition of miR-454-3p induced the NFATc2 expression. Suppression of NFATc2 blocked the effects of miR-454-3p inhibitor on cell proliferation and apoptosis in GBM cells. The results indicated that miR-454-3p executed the tumor suppressive activity via downregulating NFATc2 in GBM.

AB Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital rare disorder and a kind of developmental neuropathies, characterized by the lack of enteric neurons in variable segments of distal bowel. Our recent genome-wide association study identified a variant (rs13223150) of testis-specific A13 (TSGA13) as a potential risk locus for total colonic aganglionosis (TCA) in HSCR. The aim of this study was to identify the impact of the variant (rs13223150) and potential association of genetic variations of TSGA13 with TCA in HSCR. This study performed a fine mapping and extended analyses in Korean population. A total of 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TSGA13 were genotyped in a larger HSCR cohort (187 HSCR patients and 283 unaffected controls), and extended genetic analyses using various genetic modelling, haplotype, and combined analyses were performed. The rs13223150_A allele showed a significant association with TCA (P = 0.003), even after correcting for multiple testing (P-corr = 0.02). One haplotype (BL1_ht1, G-A-C-C) including rs13223150 also showed a significant association with TCA (P = 0.002, P-corr = 0.01). Further combined imputation analysis indicated that several single nucleotide polymorphisms of TSGA13 were significantly associated with TCA in HSCR. Although replications in other population cohorts and functional evaluations are needed, our results suggest that TSGA13 genetic variants may affect TCA in HSCR and/or the extent of aganglionosis during enteric nervous system development.

AB Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor during childhood and adolescence. Several reports have presented data on serum biomarkers for osteosarcoma, but few reports have analyzed circulating microRNAs (miRNAs). In this study, we used next generation miRNA sequencing to examine miRNAs isolated from microvesicle-depleted extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from six different human osteosarcoma or osteoblastic cell lines with different degrees of metastatic potential (i.e., SAOS2, MG63, HOS, 143B, U2OS and hFOB1.19). EVs from each cell line contain on average similar to 300 miRNAs, and similar to 70 of these miRNAs are present at very high levels (i.e., > 1000 reads per million). The most prominent miRNAs are miR-21-5p, miR-143-3p, miR-148a-3p and 181a-5p, which are enriched between 3 and 100 fold and relatively abundant in EVs derived from metastatic SAOS2 cells compared to non-metastatic MG63 cells. Gene ontology analysis of predicted targets reveals that miRNAs present in EVs may regulate the metastatic potential of osteosarcoma cell lines by potentially inhibiting a network of genes (e.g., MAPK1, NRAS, FRS2, PRCKE, BCL2 and QKI) involved in apoptosis and/or cell adhesion. Our data indicate that osteosarcoma cell lines may selectively package miRNAs as molecular cargo of EVs that could function as paracrine agents to modulate the tumor micro-environment.

AB Objective: Increasing evidence indicated that cancer-secreted exosomes played an important role in tumor metastasis. However, the function of exosomes in breast cancer pulmonary metastasis remains unknown. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of exosome-derived from breast cancer-secreted long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) on pre-metastatic niche formation in pulmonary metastasis.
   Methods: Exosomes-derived from breast cancer were separated by ultracentrifugation. The high-throughput sequencing, Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway were used to detect and evaluate the differential expression of LncRNAs in lung fibroblasts with exosomes treated. And quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to verify candidate LncRNAs expression.
   Results: We found that exosomes-derived from breast cancer induced lung fibroblasts proliferation and migration. In addition, a large number of LncRNAs expression abnormalities were involved in the breast cancer lung metastasis microenvironment.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggested that exosomal LncRNAs facilitated tumor pre-metastatic niche formation and represented a novel mechanistic insight into the molecular mechanism of cancer metastasis microenvironment.

AB Patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 (LAD1) suffer from life-threatening bacterial infections due to mutations in the common beta(2) integrin subunit (CD18/ITGB2 gene).
   We tested different fragments of the ubiquitous chromatin opening element (UCOE) from the human HNRPA2B1-CBX3 locus for their efficiency in driving the human CD18 gene expression and compared it with that of an elongation factor 1 alpha promoter (EF1 alpha L, 1169 bp; EF1 alpha S 248 bp) and a murine stem cell virus (MSCV) promoter within the context of the same lentiviral vector backbone. These vectors were tested in vitro for the human CD18 gene expression on the surface of CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) isolated from both moderate and severe LAD1 patients. Among the promoters tested in the patient's CD34(+) HSCs, only U631 bp, U652 bp, U1262 bp, 5' 2.2 kb A2UCOE and EF1 alpha S resulted in higher percentage of CD18(+)CD34(+) cells comparable to that of the MSCV promoter. The U655 bp, U723 bp, U1296 bp, U2598 bp and EF1 alpha L promoters resulted in comparatively lower numbers of CD18(+)CD34(+) cells. This study would be useful in investigating the human CD18 gene expression in an ex vivo experiment to demonstrate the phenotypic correction of LAD1 in a pre-clinical model.

AB Background: Carotid plaque is a hallmark of advanced carotid atherosclerosis and there is evidence of phosphatase and actin regulator 1 (PHACTR1) involvement in the processes that lead to atherosclerosis. PHACTR1 intronic variants have been associated with coronary artery disease and carotid dissection. Up to date the PHACTR1 haplotypes were not investigated in association with carotid plaque presence (CPP). So, the aims of this study were to investigate possible association of PHACTRI haplotypes inferred from the intronic variants rs9349379, rs2026458 and rs2876300 with CPP in patients with advanced carotid atherosclerosis and to analyze their possible effect on PHACTR1 relative mRNA expression in carotid plaque tissue specimens.
   Methods: The study group consisted of 501 patients with evidence of carotid plaque presence admitted for carotid endarterectomy and 310 healthy controls. PHACTR1 rs9349379, rs2026458, rs2876300 and relative mRNA expression were detected by TagMan (R) technology.
   Results: We have found significant and independent association of haplotype ACA with the CPP, compared to the referent haplotype GTA (adjusted OR = 1.54 95% CI = 1.07-2.21, p = 0.02). The OR was adjusted for gender, age, BMI, hypertension and total cholesterol. The relative expression of PHACTRI mRNA in carotid plaque tissue proved to be significantly higher in carriers of the ACG haplotype compared to the referent haplotype GTA (p = 0.03).
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that PHACTR1 haplotypes inferred from the variants rs9349379, rs2026458 and rs2876300 affect PHACTR1 mRNA and bear the risk for CPP in patients with advanced carotid atherosclerosis. Further replication and validation studies are inevitable.

AB Plants are frequently exposed to variable environmental stresses that adversely affect plant growth, development and agricultural production. In this study, a trypanothione synthetase gene from Trypanosoma cruzi, TcTryS, was chemically synthesized and its roles in tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses were functionally characterized by generating transgenic rice overexpressing TcTryS. Overexpression of TcTryS in rice endows transgenic plants with hypersensitivity to ABA, hyposensitivity to NaCl- and mannitol-induced osmotic stress at the seed germination stage. TcTryS overexpression results in enhanced tolerance to drought, salt, cadmium, and 2,4,6-tri-chlorophenol stresses in transgenic rice, simultaneously supported by improved physiological traits. The TcTryS-overexpression plants also accumulated greater amounts of proline, less malondialdehyde and more transcripts of stress-related genes than wild-type plants under drought and salt stress conditions. In addition, TcTryS might play a positive role in maintaining chlorophyll content under 2,4,6-trichlorophenol stress. Histochemical staining assay showed that TcTryS renders transgenic plants better ROS-scavenging capability. All of these results suggest that TcTryS could function as a key regulator in modulation of abiotic stress tolerance in plant, and may have applications in the engineering of economically important crops.

AB The WD40 transcription factor family is a superfamily found in all eukaryotes that plays important roles in regulating growth and development. To our knowledge, to date, WD40 superfamily genes have been identified and characterized in several plant species, but little information is available on the WD40 superfamily genes in peach. In this study, we identified 220 members of the WD40 superfamily in the peach genome, and these members were further classified into five subfamilies based on phylogenetic comparison with those in Arabidopsis. The members within each subfamily had conserved motifs and gene structures. The WD40 genes were unevenly distributed on chromosomes 1 to 8 of the peach genome. Additionally, 58 pairs of paralog WD40 members were found on eight chromosomes in peach, and 242 pairs of orthologous WD40 genes in peach and Arabidopsis were matched. The 54 selected putative WD40 genes in peach had diverse expression patterns in red-fleshed and white-fleshed peach fruits at five developmental stages. Prupe.6G211800.1 was located only on the cytomembrane, while Prupe.1G428200.1 and Prupe.I003200.1 were located on both the cytomembrane and in the nucleus; Prupe.1G558700.1 was densely localized around the nuclear rim but relatively faintly localized in the nucleoplasm; Prupe.5G116300.1 was located in the nucleus and cytomembrane with strong signals but showed weak signals in the cytoplasm; and Prupe.8G212400.1 and Prupe.1G053600.1 were located mainly in the nuclear envelope and cytomembrane but relatively faintly in the nucleoplasm. This study provides a foundation for the further functional verification of WD40 genes in peach.

AB FoxL2 is a member of the forkhead/HNF-3-related family of transcription factors which provides tissue specific gene regulation. It is known to regulate ovarian aromatase, which plays a crucial role in ovarian development and mature. To understand the role of FoxL2/ovarian aromatase encoded gene Cyp19a1a during ovarian development and recrudescence, we identified cDNA characteristics of FoxL2 and Cyp19a1a, analyzed its temporal expression both at transcript and protein levels in the anadromous fish, Coilia nasus. Tissue distribution pattern revealed that FoxL2 mRNA expression level was highest in ovary, while Cyp19a1a mRNA was highest in brain. During the upstream migration cycle, in ovary, the FoxL2 mRNA temporal expression peaked at the multiplication stage (stage III in May), the Cyp19a1a mRNA expression peaked at the onset stage (stage I in March). It was found that their mRNA transcripts were maintained at high level during the migration stage (from stage I in March to stage VI in July). Additionally, the strongest immunolabeling positive signals of Cyp19a1a and FoxL2 proteins were mainly found in the cytoplasm of olfactory bulb cell, stratum granulare and neurogliocyte cells and development stage oocytes. Data indicated that FoxL2 and Cyp19a1a were inducible and functional in the C. nasus ovary development and migration process. Therefore, the present results can be regarded as evidence for indispensable roles of FoxL2 and Cyp19a1a in the ovary development and migratory behavior at gene expression patterns and encoded protein distribution level.

AB Aim: To investigate the correlation between the polymorphism of estrogen receptor beta gene (ESR2) rs3020450 and cancer susceptibility, and explore the epidemiological significance and the effect of ESR2 expression levels on the prognosis of ovarian cancer.
   Methods: Based on meta-analysis the association between ESR2 rs3020450 polymorphism and cancer susceptibility was estimated and a case-control design was used to verify this result in ovarian cancer. The epidemiological effect of ESR2 rs3020450 polymorphism was assessed by attributable risk percentage (ARP) and population attributable risk percentage (PARP). Kaplan Meier plotters were used to evaluate overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in ovarian cancer patients and GEPIA for the differential expression of ESR2 levels in ovarian cancer and adjacent normal tissues.
   Results: The pooled analysis indicated no significant correlation between the ESR2 rs3020450 polymorphism and the cancer susceptibility. In the stratified analysis by cancer types, significantly decreased risk was found in ovarian cancer (AG vs GG: OR = 0.73, 95%CI: 0.53-0.97, P = 0.03). Unconditional logistic regression results of case-control study in ovarian cancer observed significant differences in all comparisons (AG vs GG: OR = 0.81, 95%CI: 0.62-0.98, P = 0.04; AA vs GG: OR = 0.63, 95%CI: 0.42-0.92, P = 0.01 and AG + AA vs GG: OR = 0.73, 95%CI: 0.53-0.96, P < 0.001). Based on meta-analysis and case-control pooled results, ARP and PARP were evaluated respectively in allele (21.95% and7.97%), heterozygote (36.99% and 12.11%) and dominant model (36.84% and 12.97%) of rs3020450 polymorphism in ovarian cancer. The expression levels of ESR2 in normal tissues was significantly higher than that in cancer tissues (OV, Median, 4.7:0.21), and significant correlations were observed between high ESR2 expression levels and long OS (HR = 0.80, 95%CI: 0.70-0.92, P = 0.002) and PFS (HR = 0.767, 95%CI: 0.67-0.88, P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Our results indicated that ESR2 rs3020450 polymorphism was associated with ovarian cancer risk from epidemiological perspective, and high ESR2 expression levels was associated with long survival in patients with ovarian cancer.

AB Background: Periodontal disease (PD), a chronic inflammatory disorder mediated by progressive destruction of the oral cavity is one of the key factors for many systemic disorders including Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). The upregulation of CDKN2BAS, a long noncoding RNA gene expression in gingival epithelial cells and gingival fibroblasts of periodontitis shows a strong correlation between the severity of atherosclerosis and PD. Considering the crucial role of CDKN2BAS gene polymorphisms (rs496892 G > A and rs7865618 A > G) and its expression the present study sought to identify the possible association with the disease predisposition in South Indian population.
   Methods: For the present case-control study a total of 200 subjects that include 100 PD-CAD patients and 100 controls were recruited with prior consent. Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted and utilized for genotyping via ARMS-PCR and PCR-RFLP, and expression using RT-PCR respectively.
   Results: The results showed a significant association of both the polymorphisms with that of the disease predisposition. The wild type genotypes (GG: OR-0.37; p-0.001; & AA: OR-0.29; p-0.005) conferred protection against the disease, whereas, the heterozygotes (GA: OR-2.45; p-0.004 & AG: OR-3.41; p-0.0001) conferred risk towards the disease, suggesting the involvement of the variant allele in disease causation. These results were further confirmed by haplotype analysis among A-G block (two variant alleles at both loci) with 2.5 fold risk (OR = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.16-5.36, p = 0.02) and G-G block (single risk allele at rs7865618 locus) with 3-fold risk (OR-3.0; p-0.01) towards the disease, suggesting the dominant involvement of rs7865618 in the disease causation. Though the expression of the CDKN2BAS gene is more in patients than controls, the variant genotypes among patients were evaluated to be down-regulated than the other genotypes.
   Conclusion: The present study concludes that the two selected polymorphisms have significant involvement individually and in interaction with each other in the disease predisposition. The expression studies also suggest that the selected polymorphisms in the 9p21.3 locus affect the CDKN2BAS gene expression. However, the results obtained in the present study should be confirmed with large samples in other ethnic cohorts.

AB Gene promoter methylation is a common epigenetic event, taking place in the early phase of tumorigenesis, which has a great potential as a diagnostic and prognostic cancer biomarker. In this umbrella review, we provide an overview on the association between gene-promoter methylation of protein-coding genes and cancer risk based on currently available meta-analyses data on gene promoter methylation. We searched MEDLINE via PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for meta-analyses that examine the association between gene-promoter methylation and cancer, published until January 2019 in English. We used AMSTAR to assess the quality of the included studies and applied a set of pre-specified criteria to evaluate the magnitude of each association. We provide a comprehensive overview of 80 unique combinations between 22 different genes and 18 cancer outcomes, all of which indicated a positive association between promoter hypermethylation and cancer. In total, the 70 meta-analyses produced significant results under a random-effects model with odds ratios that ranged from 1.94 to 26.60, with the summary effect being in favor of the unmethylated group in all cases. Three of the strong evidence associations involve RASSFI methylation on bladder cancer risk (OR = 18.46; 95% CI: 12.69-26.85; I-2 = 0%), MGMT methylation on NSCLC (OR = 4.25; 95% CI: 2.83-6.38; I-2 = 22.4%) and RARB methylation on prostate cancer (OR = 6.87; 95% CI: 4.68-10.08; I-2 = 0%). Meta-analyses showed a moderate quality, AMSTAR score ranging from 4 to 9 (Mdn = 8; IQR: 7.0 to 8.0). As primary studies and metaanalyses on the subject accumulate, more genetic loci may be found to be highly associated with specific cancer types and hence the biomarker sets will become wider.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the cancer biology such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The pivotal roles that miRNA expression plays, make them ideal candidates for detection of cancer progression as well as cancer metastasis. Especially for breast, lung and prostate cancer which are originated from soft tissues and prone to metastasis. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the expression level of miR145-3p which is a shared potential biomarker identified by meta-analysis of breast, prostate and lung cancer data sets.
   Six different data sets representative of three different cancer types were analyzed. These data sets are pooled together to have a master metamiRNA list while getting rid of the platform differentiations between them. As a result, 24 common differentially expressed miRNAs are determined in which miR-145-3p has the topmost rank. To mimic in vivo cancer microenvironment, hypoxia and serum deprivation were used to induce metastasis in breast (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453), prostate (PC3, LNCaP, DU145), lung (A549, NCIH82,) cancer cell lines and noncancerous cell lines of the coresponding tissues (MCF10A, RWPE-1, MRC-5).
   miR-145-3p expression levels were determined by qRT-PCR. It has been shown that it is down regulated by the induction of metastasis in cancer cell lines while it is up regulated in normal cell lines to suppress the tumor formation. As a conclusion, as representing the same results in three different cancer cell types, miR-145-3p will be a promising biomarker to follow up its expression to detect cancer metastasis.

AB To investigate the effect of HSP70-hom + 2437 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on hypoxia and ischemia condition, we constructed the neuronal hypoxic injury model and the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model to compare the inhibition rate of neurons and detect the infarct volume as well as the expression of related apoptotic proteins in order to explore the possible mechanisms. The neuroblastoma cells SHSY5Y were divided into the OE (transfected with the C allele) group, OEmu (transfected with the T allele) group and negative control (NC, transfected with the empty lentiviral vector CON195) group. Varying degrees of hypoxia were induced by deferoxamine (DFO). The inhibition rate of hypoxic neurons and the expression of related apoptotic proteins were detected in the three genotype groups. While in the rat MCAO model, we built five groups including the sham group, the blank control group (injected with physiological saline), the negative control group (injected with lentivirus and physiological saline), the C allele group and the T allele group (injected with lentivirus overexpressing C and T allele). The MCAO model operation was then underwent in all five groups, the infarct volume by TTC staining and the expression of related apoptotic proteins were detected after 24 h. The results in neuronal hypoxic injury model showed a significant difference in the inhibition rate between the three groups (P < 0.05), and the average inhibition rates for the OEmu, OE and NC groups were 13.2%, 19.2% and 23.3%, respectively. The inhibition rates also differed between lower and higher DFO concentrations (P < 0.05). Compared with the NC group, Bax decreased significantly in the OE and OEmu groups, whereas PI3K and HSPA1L (HSP70-hom) increased. However, the expression of Bax in the OEmu group decreased significantly more than in the OE group, whereas PI3K and HSPA1L levels showed no difference between the two groups. Corresponding with the results above, overexpressing HSP70-hom could reduce the infarct volume of ischemic injury by TTC staining in rat MCAO model and the T allele group also had less infarct volume than C allele group. Compared with the sham group, blank control group and negative control group, Bax decreased significantly in the C and T allele groups, while HSPA1L and p- AKT increased. Furthermore, the expression of Bax in the T allele group decreased significantly more than that in the C allele group, while there were no significant differences in HSPA1L and p-AKT levels between the two groups. Therefore, the overexpression of HSP70-hom + 2437 could play a protective role in hypoxic neurons and ischemic brain tissue by upregulating the expression of HSPAlL and PI3K/p-AKT and downregulating the expression of BAX. The neuroprotective effect of the T allele was stronger than that of the C allele, which may be related to the strengthened downregulation of BAX.

AB LncRNA CASC11 promotes gastric cancer and colon cancer. Our study analyzed the role of CASC11 in ovarian squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In the present study we showed that plasma CASC11 was upregulated in OSCC, and the upregulation of CASC11 distinguished OSCC patients from control group. Plasma levels of CASC11 were further increased after chemotherapy. Treatment with oxaliplatin, tetraplatin, cisplatin, and carboplatin mediated the upregulation of CASC11 in cells of OSCC cell line. In addition, overexpression of CASC11 led to increased cancer cell viability under oxaliplatin, tetraplatin, cisplatin, and carboplatin treatment, while CASC11 SiRNA silencing played an opposite role. Therefore, overexpression of CASC11 in OSCC mediated the development of cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy.

AB Homocysteine can be converted to cysteine via the transsulfuration pathway where cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is a rate-limiting enzyme. Homocysteine is thought to play a role in bone remodelling and strength. Previous results indicated that some of the difference in bone strength of end-of-lay hens may be associated with CBS expression level. To investigate if differences in the promoter region of the CBS gene might be responsible for observed differences in gene expression between CBS alleles post mortem- and in-vitro expression studies have been undertaken. Transfection of the DF-1 avian cell line with a series of deletion fragments of the 5' promoter, or constructs containing three CBS allele sequences, with a luciferase reporter revealed that a core region of -155 to + 131 bp in the CBS promoter was essential for mRNA expression. We found that a variable number of short tandem repeats (7 nucleotide motif and 6 nucleotide repeats) in the core region of the promoter affecting the transcriptional activity and a strong effect for gene expression. However, methylation of the 6 nucleotide repeats varied between allelic variants and these maybe responsible for differences in promoter activity. Our findings indicated variable short tandem repeats and the differentially methylated sites in the promoter region may be responsible for CBS expression differences in the bone of laying hens.

AB Cynanchum thesioides are upright, xerophytic shrubs that are widely distributed in arid and semi-arid areas of China, North Korea, Mongolia and Siberia. To date, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of drought resistance in C. thesioides. To better understand drought resistance, we used transcriptome analysis and Illumina sequencing technology on C. thesioides, to identify drought-responsive genes. Using de novo assembly 55,268 unigenes were identified from 207.58 Gb of clean data. Amongst these, 36,265 were annotated with gene descriptions, conserved domains, gene ontology terms and metabolic pathways. The sequencing results showed that genes that were differentially expressed (DEGs) under drought stress were enriched in pathways such as carbon metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction. Moreover, many functional genes were up-regulated under severe drought stress to enhance tolerance. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis showed that there were key hub genes related to drought stress. Hundreds of candidate genes were identified under severe drought stress, including transcriptional factors such as MYB, G2-like, ERF, C2H2, NAC, NF-X1, GRF, HD-ZIP, HB-other, HSF, C3H, GRAS, WRKY, bHLH and Trihelix. These data are a valuable resource for further investigation into the molecular mechanism for drought stress in C. thesioides and will facilitate exploration of drought resistance genes.

AB Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a major insect pest of maize in sub-Saharan Africa, has developed high levels of non-recessive resistance to Cry1Ab toxin expressed in genetically modified Bt maize. Multiple resistance mechanisms to various Cry toxins have been identified in Lepidoptera, but no study has yet been done to determine the mechanism of Cry1Ab resistance in B. fusca. Therefore, the larval transcriptome of B. fusca was sequenced, de novo assembled and characterized. Differential expression analysis was performed to compare gene expression profiles of Cry toxin challenged and unchallenged neonate larvae to assess the molecular basis of the defence mechanism employed by this insect. Several genes associated with Cry toxin resistance in other lepidopteran pests were detected in B. fusca. Results suggest that differential expression of metabolic and immune-related genes might explain Cry1Ab toxin defence in this pest (supplemental file). Transcript expression profiles of neonates demonstrated that 33.59% and 60.31% of the 131 differentially expressed genes were upregulated and downregulated in the toxin-challenged neonate larvae, respectively. Transcripts were grouped into two subclusters according to the similarity of their expression patterns. Transcripts in subcluster 1 were moderately upregulated in the toxin-challenged neonate larvae, and, conversely, downregulated in the unchallenged neonate larvae. The solute carrier organic anion transporter, which is involved in insecticide detoxification, was upregulated in the toxin-challenged neonate larvae. Conversely, most of the transcripts in subcluster 2 were moderately downregulated in the toxin-challenged neonate larvae, and upregulated for neonates feeding on non-challenged maize. Four unidentified transcripts were extremely downregulated in the toxin-challenged neonate larvae, and upregulated in the unchallenged neonate larvae. Further studies are recommended to establish if there is a direct correlation between these differentially expressed genes and the observed resistance. Elucidation of such defence mechanisms is crucial for developing insect resistance management strategies to ensure sustainable use of genetically modified maize in Africa. Nevertheless, this is the first study on gene expression profiles of B. fusca strains challenged with Cry toxin. The transcriptome characterized in this study provides a significant resource base for future studies on B. fusca and contributes to understanding some of the gene regulation and signalling networks involved in the defence of B. fusca against Cry1Ab toxin.

AB Iron-responsive elements (IREs) are similar to 35-nucleotide (nt) stem-loop RNA structures located in 5' or 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs that mediate post-transcriptional regulation by their association with IRE-binding proteins (IRPs). IREs are characterized by their apical 6-nt loop motif 5'-CAGWGH-3' (W = A or U and H = A, C or U), the so-called pseudotriloop, of which the loop nts C1 and G5 are paired, and the none-paired C between the two stem regions. In this study, the yeast three-hybrid (Y3H) system was used to investigate the relevance of the pseudotriloop structure of ferritin light chain (FTL) for the IRE-IRP interaction and the binding affinities between variant IRE(-like) structures and the two IRP isoforms, IRP1 and 2. Destabilization of the pseudotriloop structure by a G5-to-A mutation reduced binding of IRP1 and 2, while restoring the pseudotriloop conformation by the compensatory Cl-to-U mutation, restored binding to both IRPs. In particular, IRP1 showed even stronger binding to the C1U-G5A mutant than to the wildtype FTL IRE. On the other hand, deletion of the bulged-out 1.16 of the pseudotriloop did not significantly affect its binding to either IRP1 or 2, but substitution with C particularly enhanced the binding to IRP1. In comparison to FTL IRE, IRE-like structures of 5'-amino-levulinate synthase 2 (ALAS2) and SLC40A1 (also known as ferroportin-1) showed similar or, in the case of endothelial PAS domain protein 1 (EPAS1) IRE, slightly weaker binding affinity to IRPs. SLC11A2 (a.k.a. divalent metal transporter-1) IRE exhibited relatively weak binding to IRP1 and medium binding to IRP2. Notably, the IRE-like structure of alpha-synuclein showed no detectable binding to either IRP under the conditions used in this Y3H assay. Our results indicate that Y3H can be used to characterize binding between IRPs and various IRE-like structures in vivo.

AB Integrins are cell attachment receptors that function in the communication between the intracellular and extracellular compartments. Integrins and extra cellular matrix (ECM) collaborate to regulate gene expression by extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). Integrins as regulators, have critical role in ECM remodeling. Fibrosis is the hallmark of obesity and insulin resistance originated by aberrant ECM remodeling. Therefore deciphering integrins' expression profile in cells at different conditions is worthy. The aim of this study is evaluation of integrins' gene expression profile changes in mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, adipocytes, insulin resistant and hypertrophic adipocytes. For this purpose, we differentiated mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes, insulin resistant and hypertrophied adipocytes and assayed integrins' gene expression in four conditions by real time-PCR. Also the proteins expression changes of ERK and collagen VI assayed by Western blotting. Data analysis has shown that integrins' gene expression changes throughout adipocyte differentiation and pathological processes. The expressions of many integrins genes were significantly up- or down-regulated by >1.5-fold during differentiation, insulin resistant, and hypertrophic adipocytes. In addition to changes in the type of integrin, the integrins expression levels were different. Integrins, on the whole were more expressed in pathological processes relative to normal adipocytes. Also, phosphorylation of ERK 1,2 was increased >1.5-fold in differentiated, insulin resistant and hypertrophied adipocytes versus preadipocytes. Collagen VI only increased 2-fold in hypertrophied adipocytes. Examination of the total integrin gene family expression during adipocyte differentiation and pathological processes, leads to the identification of differential integrin gene expression. These results suggest that the type of integrin may not only play a role in adipocyte differentiation but also in pathological processes which may associate to increased ERK pathway activity in these conditions.

AB To elucidate the possible biosynthetic pathway of a precursor UDP-glucose of the sphingan WL gum produced by Sphingomonas sp. WG, two enzymes phosphoglucomutase (PGM) and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGPase) were bioinformatically analysed, expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and characterized. PGM was in the phosphoglucomutase/phosphomannomutase subclass and UGPase was predicted to be a UDP-glucose pyrophosphatase in a tetrameric structure. Both enzymes were expressed in soluble form, purified to near homogeneity with high activity at 1159 and 796 U/mg, exhibited folding with reasonable secondary structures, and existed as monomer and tetramer, respectively. The optimal pH and temperature of PGM were 9.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively, and this protein was stable at pH 8.0 and at temperatures ranging from 40 to 50 degrees C. The optimal pH and temperature of UGPase were 9.0 and 45 degrees C, respectively, and the protein was stable at pH 8.0 and at temperatures ranging from 30 to 55 degrees C. A small-scale one-pot biosynthesis of UDP-glucose by combining PGM and UGPase using glucose-6-phosphate and UTP as substrates was also performed, and formation of UDP-glucose was observed by HPLC detection, which confirmed the biosynthetic pathway of UDP-glucose in vitro. PGM and UGPase will be ideal targets for the metabolic engineering to improve WL gum yields in industrial production.

AB alpha-Transaminase (alpha-TA) responsible for catalyzing the reversible transfer of amino groups between amine donors and amine acceptors, is applicable to enzymatic route for asymmetric synthesis of herbicide L-phosphinothricin (L-PPT). In the search for alpha-TAs with better catalysis performance, three alpha-TAs were discovered by genome mining approach using a known sequence encoding Escherichia coli tyrosine TA (TyrB) as probe. Through detailed comparison of their expression amount, activities and characteristics, Citrobacter koseri TA (CkTA) exhibited better activity and thermostability, which retain 65.9% of initial activity after incubation at 57 degrees C for 4 h. The Km and kcat/Km values of CkTA were 36.75mM and 34.29 mM(-1) min(-1), respectively. In addition, recombinant CkTA cells were immobilized onto Celite 545 using tris(hydroxymethyl) phosphine as crosslinker. During five repetitive asymmetric synthesis of L-PPT from 20 g/L prostereogenic ketone using L-Glu as amine donor, all the yields of L-PPT reached up to 91.2% (> 99% ee). These characteristics made CkTA a valuable addition to the currently scarce a-TA library for stereospecific synthesis of L-PPT.

AB Integration of dark- and photo-fermentation is a promising strategy to enhance saline wastewater treatment efficiency and biohydrogen production. In this study, dark-and photo-fermentative bacterial consortium was respectively enriched and their communities were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Both consortia were mainly composed of hydrogen-producing strains. After the first-stage dark-fermentation, the following conditions were applied prior to the second-stage fermentation: fermentative broth pH regulation (the pH group), glucose addition (the glucose group), glucose addition and pH regulation (the glucose+ pH group), photosynthetic bacteria addition (the photo group), and photosynthetic bacteria addition and pH regulation (the photo + pH group), respectively. Dark fermentative broth with no pretreatment was used as control (the control group). Then the second stage began. The results showed that pH restriction had more influence than substrate or products restriction on dark-fermentative hydrogen production. Addition of photo-fermentative bacteria after dark-fermentation increased the hydrogen yield (134%) and substrate utilization (67%). These findings indicated syntrophic interactions between dark- and photo-fermentative bacteria during the hydrogen production process.

AB Perfusion cell culture technologies for the production of therapeuthic recombinant proteins are currently on the rise for diverse applications with the aim of process intensification (Bielser et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018; Fisher et al., 2018; Jordan et al., 2018). This study reports a unique comparison of low (LS) and high (HS) seeding fed-batch bioreactors, corresponding to traditional and intensified operation using perfusion at the N-1 stage, respectively, with perfusion (PF) bioreactors, using a bispecific conjugated fusion protein as a model. It is found that the gain in daily volumetric productivity compared to the traditional LS fed-batch, increases by a factor 3 with HS and 7 with PF. Critical quality attributes (CQAs) also benefited from the perfusion operation. In particular, levels of clipping, that is the fragmentation of the fusion protein, are significantly reduced compared to both fed-batch operations. In PF the clipping varied between 0.6 and 1.5% while in the LS and HS it reached up to 8.7 and 4.9%, respectively. Aggregate levels were also decreased using PF, while the charge variant distribution was more homogeneous and the glycosylation pattern was also significantly affected. The comparison of LS, HS and PF for the manufacturing of a bispecific conjugated fusion protein reported here highlight some productivity and quality benefits inherent to the nature of continuous processing.

AB Rhizobium leguminosarum bv trifolii strains TA1 and CC275e have been widely used as effective nitrogen fixing strains for white clover in New Zealand, but rhizobia survival on seeds is usually poor due to different stress conditions. The aim of this study was to select one of those commercial strains grown in a solid carrier (core) and study the influence of the core: polymer ratio in a microencapsulation process by spray drying using guar gum as coating material. First, strains TA1 and CC275e grown on peat and diatomaceous earth were exposed to temperature and desiccation stress. Both strains were stable at 40 degrees C and completely died after five minutes at 80 degrees C, while CC275e was more stable than TA1 at 60 degrees C. TA1 and CC275e slightly decreased viability after six hours drying with either carriers, with no differences between strains. A central composite design was used to develop the microencapsulation process. Independent variables were: inlet temperature (130 degrees C) and feed flow rate (5 mL/min). Microparticles presented rhizobia loading in 10(7) CFU/g and mean particle size between 10 and 30 mu m. Optimized process reached 50% yield and 10(7) CFU/g loading. Rhizobia viability dropped two logarithmic units during the microencapsulation/drying process, possibly due to the negative effects of dehydration and high outlet temperature (approximate to 70 degrees C), suggesting the need to continue optimizing the process by improving the thermal profile in the drying chamber.

AB Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb), encoded by the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin gene (vgb), is highly effective at binding oxygen and delivering it to both prokaryotes and eukaryotes under hypoxic conditions. In this study, we introduced the vgb gene into shiitake mushrooms, and the mycelia of the transformatants grew faster. In particular, they spread into the solid substrate located in the lower part of the test tubes and bags where the oxygen was hypoxic and produced more beta-glucan and plant biomass degrading enzymes compared to the original strain. The maximum growth rate of the transformants was 8.5%-15.9% higher than that of the original strain on sawdustbased cultures in plastic bags. The laccase and amylase activities were 17.7%-40.3% and 16.7%-37.9% higher than that of the original strain, respectively. In addition, the beta-glucan contents of the transformant mycelia from the submerged fermentation were 12.9%-24.0% higher than that of the original strain. These results reveal that the expression of VHb in mushroom fungi promots the mycelial growth in solid-state cultures under the hypoxic condition as well as enhances beta-glucan and plant biomass degrading enzymes production.

AB Microbial transglutaminases (MTGs) catalyzes the formation of Gln-Lys isopeptide bonds and are widely used for the cross-linking of proteins and peptides in food and in biotechnological applications for bioconjugation reactions. In view of its practical utility, a comparative study of the catalytic activity and stability of the enzyme in a wide range of denaturing conditions has been performed through Circular Dichroism (CD), fluorescence and activity assays performed with model substrates. In agreement with previous results, we show that MTG has a significant structural and functional tolerance to pH changes, whereas the enzyme stability and activity decrease in presence of increasing amounts of denaturing agents, such as urea and guanidinium chloride (GdnHCl). Noteworthy, the activity of MTG in denaturing conditions differs markedly from that in pseudo-physiological settings, shifting unexpectedly toward higher substrate specificity. Also, the use of controlled amounts of denaturing agents (1.0-1.5M urea) largely improves yields and purity of the final products of 10-15% and 25-30%, respectively. These findings widen the range of applicability of the MTG-mediated biocatalysis for industrial and biotechnological purposes.

AB Entrapment of microalgae in silica hydrogels enables the application as biocatalysts in continuous production of secreted products. Despite a mitigation of substrate and product diffusion limitations by lens-shaped particles, there are no reports on light supply and limitation. This study investigated the impact of hydrogel structure, particle size and biomass loading on the behaviour of the microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii entrapped in lens-shaped silica particles.
   Entrapment in tetraethyl orthosilicate and tetra(n-propylamino) silane based hydrogels reduced the growth rate by 30% and 23%, respectively. In contrast, cells entrapped in sodium silicate based hydrogels displayed a growth rate similar to free cells and cells entrapped in calcium alginate (1.13 d(-1)), indicating a suitable biocompatibility. Reduction of lens height by 26% maintained the growth rate in silica hydrogel. A fourfold increase in biomass loading reduced the growth rate by 20% and elevated the yield coefficient by 211%, indicating the impact of biomass loading on light and nutrient supply on photosynthetic growth. Finally, hydrogen production was observed by entrapped cells.
   The results of this work will pave the way for robust biocatalytic processes where photosynthetically active cells are protected against harmful mechanical and biological influences.

AB Natural compounds and derivatives play an essential role in the pharmaceutical industry, however, the difficulty in resynthesizing natural products or isolate them from the native host, often limit their availability, elevate costs and slow down the pharmaceutical manufacturing process. In this context, application of synthetic biology could enable the efficient production of large amounts of drugs or drug precursors in heterologous microorganisms aiming to accelerate the entire manufacturing process. Considering this perspective, here we developed a pipeline to automatically search for metabolites available in the metabolic space that are structurally similar to worldwide approved drugs. This pipeline involved the in silico screening of metabolites from a metabolic pathway meta-database using both Tanimoto coefficients based on Daylight like fingerprints and Maximum Common Substructure algorithm. The method was successfully applied to identify metabolites sharing essential scaffolds with one or more drugs as potential candidates for metabolic engineering. Three of these metabolites (Festuclavine, Scopolamine, and Baccatin III) were identified as similar to many drugs like Cabergoline, Oxitropium, Paclitaxel and had their metabolic pathways computationally mapped for their production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with our proprietary pathway design software. These compounds are examples of new opportunities for the application of synthetic biology in pharmaceutical production.

AB Biologically manufactured monoclonal antibodies (mAb) can strongly vary in their efficacy and affinity. Therefore, engineering and production of the mAb is highly regulated and requires product monitoring, especially in terms of N-glycosylation patterns. In this work, we present a high-throughput matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) method based on a microarray technology to monitor N-glycopeptides of IgG1 produced in a perfusion cell culture. A bottom-up approach combined with zwitterionic-hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography for sample purification was used to determine the day-by-day variation of the terminal galactose within two major N-glycoforms. Our results show that microarrays for mass spectrometry (MAMS) are a robust platform for the rapid determination of the carbohydrate distribution. The spectral repeatability is characterized by a low coefficient of variations (1.7% and 7.1% for the FA2 and FA2G1 structures, respectively) and allows to detect the N-glycosylation variability resulting from operating conditions during the bioreactor process. The observed trend of released N-glycans was confirmed using capillary gel electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection. Therefore, the microarray technology is a promising analytical tool for glycosylation control during the production process of recombinant proteins.

AB L-theanine, an amino acid known for its favourable taste and linked with health benefits, can be prepared by enzymatic synthesis using gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT; E.C 2.3.2.2). In the present study, a novel GGT from Bacillus pumilus ML413 was expressed in Bacillus subtlis 168 and exhibited high stability at low temperature (40 degrees C) and alkaline pH 10, compared to the other GGTs. To enhance GGT production, firstly, PrsA lipoproteins was overexpressed in the host which resulted in the extracellular GGT activity doubled. Subsequently, a suitable poly (A/T) tail (TTTAAA) was selected and added to the 3'-terminal of ggt gene, which increased the mRNA stability of ggt gene by 58% and the activity of GGT by 60%. Finally, under optimized fed batch system, L-theanine yield was 53 g l(-1) within 16 h. In this study, we demonstrate a convenient strategy of increasing theanine yield using GGT overexpressing in a safe host B. subtilis 168.

AB 4-Coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL) is an important branch point directing metabolites to flavonoid or monolignol pathways in plants. It plays a vital role in the biosynthesis of plant nature products in microbes. Herein, Ptr4CL4, Ptr4CL5 and Ptr4CL7 from Populus trichocarpa were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Two recombinant proteins Ptr4CL4 and Ptr4CL5 showed distinct activities for different substrates. The Ptr4CL4, not previously reported, showed the highest affinity and activity for p-coumaric acid, but a unique substrate self-inhibition was observed at high concentration of p-coumaric acid. Ptr4CL5 was suitable for pathway construction due to no self-substrate inhibition and high initial reaction rate. To explore the potential of Ptr4CL5 in biosynthesis of cinnamyl alcohol, a biosynthesis pathway established with Ptr4CL5, PtrCCR2, endogenous reductases was constructed in E. coli and the titer of cinnamyl alcohol reached 4.8 mM which is higher than other reports. The result indicates that the wood-derived Ptr4CL5 has signification potential in the biosynthesis of cinnamyl alcohol and other monolignol derivatives.

AB An overproduction of free radicals or reactive oxygen species, often due to environmental factors, can alter the DNA structure and irreversibly modify proteins and lipids in the living cells. The superoxide anion (O2-) is one of the strongest oxidant molecules produced under oxidative stress conditions but it can be neutralized by the action of the enzymes SuperOxide Dismutases (SODs). In all the human tissues, SODs are essential for the prevention of serious diseases and the protection against oxidative stress damages. In the dermo-cosmetic sector, SODs have found promising applications, but their use is limited due to the loss of activity following the addition of the enzyme in the skin care formulas and the exposure of the skin to UV radiations and heat. Extremophile organisms, which proliferate in extreme physical and/or geochemical conditions, represent a potential source of stable SOD enzymes, able to function even in harsh conditions of high temperature, acid pH and long UV exposures. In the present study we investigated on a Mn-SOD deriving from the extremophilic bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans and, after its expression in E. coli, the Mn-SOD was characterized in terms of chemical and physical properties. Its extraordinary features in terms of UV resistance prompted us to investigate further about its potential applications in the dermo-cosmetic sector. It was expressed in Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) cell cultures with the main goal of developing a new ingredient, capable of keeping its ROS neutralizing activity once exposed to UV radiations and even when added to skin care formulas.

AB Oryza sativa L. (Rice) a grain crop grown considerably in areas frequented with abiotic stresses has a higher heat and drought tolerance and is deemed a model crop for tolerance studies. Manifold environment testing facilitates recognition of constant genotypes of rice mutants for adverse abiotic stress conditions. Mutants are an imperative genetic reserve which can help as an informative basis of natural disparity. We assessed EMS induced early flowering rice mutants (Control, BM6, BM6' and BM9) for potential study of stress tolerance under limited water, salinity and high zinc conditions by testing for plant growth (biophysical and biochemical) traits, as well ascytotoxicity and genotoxicity determination assay via MTT and epifluoresence microscopy methods in root tissues of the mutants. Environmental effect was more significant than genotypic contribution on biophysical and biochemical parameters. BM9 mutant was found to be the most stable genotype in tolerance studies among other mutants in artificially created stress environments viz. mannitol (moderated drought), sodium chloride (salinity stress), zinc sulfate (heavy metal stress) and zinc oxide nanoparticles for a time duration. These mutants are a valuable resource for varietal advancements and to determine genes for tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses. To our knowledge this is the first account on validation of manifold abiotic stresses in early flowering rice mutants. This study can additionally assist fastidious detection of stress-tolerance genes in this vital crop.

AB In the present study, we have prepared microRNA(miR)-124-loaded Rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG)29 surface-conjugated polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) to improve neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease (PD). We hypothesize that an increase in the intracellular concentration of miR-124 will result in a better prognosis for Parkinson's disease. Minimal toxicity for the RVG29 NPs was observed at concentrations < 100 mu g/mL, while the cell viability of cells treated with blank NPs at concentrations of 200 mu g/mL markedly decreased, indicating the safety of the carrier system. Results showed that mRNA levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin (IL)-6, significantly increased upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. However, the mRNA levels of these cytokines reflected those of the miR-NPs-treated control group, indicating the influence of miR-124 exposure. After transfection with miR-NPs, levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neuroprotective molecules were reduced and increased, respectively. Administration of LPS significantly increased the levels of mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MEKK)3 and P-P65 levels, while transfection with miR-NPs significantly reduced the expression of both MEKK3 and P-P65, reflecting that of the control. This research has revealed that miR-124 could target both the MEKK3 and nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cell (NF-Kb) pathways, while also reducing inflammatory cytokine levels. In addition, a 3-fold decrease in apoptosis was observed in miR-NP transfected cells. The exogenous delivery of miR-NPs significantly downregulated MEKK3 expression in animal studies, as outlined by immunohistochemical staining (IHC). Overall, miR-NPs have the potential to inhibit pro-inflammatory signaling and enhance neuroprotection in PD.

AB We developed a new oil-based delivery system for transdermal protein delivery, a gel-in-oil (G/O) nanosuspension, where gelatin-based hydrogel was coated with hydrophobic surfactants. The high entrapment efficiency of a model protein, phycocyanin (PC), into nano-sized gelatin hydrogel particles was achieved. Spectroscopic evaluation of PC suggested that the G/O nanosuspension could retain the functional form of PC in isopropyl myristate. In vitro skin permeation studies showed that the G/O nanosuspension facilitated the delivery of PC through the stratum corneum of Yucatan micropig skin.

AB Liposome is one of the promising technologies for antigen delivery in cancer immunotherapies. It seems that the phospholipid content of liposomes can act as immunostimulatory molecules in cancer immunotherapy. In the present study, the immunological properties of different phospholipid content of liposomal antigen delivery platforms were investigated. To this aim, F1 to F4 naive liposomes (without tumor-specific loaded antigens) of positively charged DOTAP/Cholesterol/DOPE (4/4/4 mol ratio), negatively charged DMPC/DMPG/Cholesterol/ DOPE (15/2/3/5), negatively charged DSPC/DSPG/Cholesterol/DOPE (15/2/3/5) and PEGylated HSPC/ mPEG2000-DSPE/Cholesterol (13/110) liposomal compositions were administered in mice bearing C26 colon carcinoma to assess tumor therapy. Moreover, In-vitro studies were conducted, including cytotoxicity assay, serum cytokines measurements, IFN-gamma and IL-4 ELISpot assay, T cells subpopulation frequencies assay. The liposomes containing DOTAP and DOPE (F1 liposomes) were able to stimulate cytotoxic T lymphocytes signals such as IFN-gamma secretions. In parallel, the aforementioned phospholipids stimulated secretion of IL-4 and IL-17 cytokines from T helper cells. However, these liposomes did not improve survival indices in mice. As conclusion, DOTAP and DOPE contained liposomes (F1 liposomes) stimulate a mixture of Th1 and Th2 immune responses in a tumor-specific antigens-free manner in mice bearing C26 colon carcinoma. Therefore, phospholipid composition of liposomes merits consideration in designing antigen-containing liposomes for cancer immunotherapy.

AB The sudden expansion of gas at the outlet of the jet (pneumatic) nebulizer significantly reduces the temperature of the solution, which may provoke bronchospasm, therefore it is recommended to use modern pneumatic inhalers equipped with a thermostat or a universal thermal attachment that allow to obtain a higher temperature aerosol, i.e. thermo-aerosol. The research was carried out for model Newtonian fluids. The droplet diameters of the aerosol spray were investigated using a Spraytec aerosol particle size measurement system. Analysis of the obtained results showed that the increase in solution viscosity caused a decrease in mean droplet diameters and prolonged nebulization time. The analysis of experimental data made it possible to propose a correlation equation describing the mean diameter of the droplets depending on the properties of the liquid and the flow conditions in the thermostated medical nebulizer. The obtained data contributes to a better understanding of the complex liquid atomisation process and can be helpful in the design of medical nebulizers and pharmaceutical preparations.

AB The Chinese loess has been widely studied in order to reconstruct Cenozoic environmental change. Cretaceous loess-like red beds with alternating red and gray layers in the Lanzhou basin, Northwest China are well preserved and can be used for understanding the Mesozoic environmental and climatic changes. However, the red beds and gray clays are less studied and their significance is not clear. Hence, Cretaceous red beds of the basin are studied. The gray layers show horizontal lamination and are deposited in a lacustrine environment, whereas the red layers show gradational change in texture and color, and are analogous to paleosols. The red and gray clays show similar immobile trace elemental compositions and identical grain size distributions, suggesting that the sediments of the two deposits are derived from the same source and carried by identical transporting forces. The dominant 2-10 mu m fine grain size component indicates that the deposits are sorted through long-distance transportation. In this context, the magnetic properties of the red beds are mainly determined by post-depositional environmental development. Hematite is the dominant magnetic mineral and some of the gray layers contains small quantities of magnetite. Therefore, the red and gray layers develop on land and under water, respectively. The magnetic parameter IRM-100mT eliminates the effects of ferromagnetic minerals and is sensitive to hard magnetic minerals. Thus, it can be used as a proxy for paleoclimatic change. Its high values in the red layers correspond to a drier paleoclimatic environment.

AB A new lithostratigraphical framework for Singapore is proposed, based on the analysis of c. 20,000 m of core recovered from 121 c. 205 m deep boreholes and augmented with 218 field localities from across Singapore. The new framework describes a succession dating from the Carboniferous to the Quaternary. New U-Pb detrital zircon dates and fossil analysis were used to constrain the ages of key sedimentary units. The oldest known sedimentary rocks in Singapore are found to be the deformed Carboniferous (Mississippian) Sajahat Formation. These are succeeded by the newly erected, Middle and Upper Triassic, marine to continental Jurong Group and Sentosa Group successions that accumulated in the southern part of the Semantan Basin. The Jurong Group comprises four formations: the Tuas Formation, the Pulau Ayer Chawan Formation, the Pandan Formation and the Boon Lay Formation. The Sentosa Group contains two formations: the Tanjong Rimau Formation and the Fort Siloso Formation. In Singapore, the depositional record during this time is related to late Permian to Triassic arc magmatism in the southern part of the forearc basin to the Sukhothai Arc. The Jurong and Sentosa groups were deformed and weakly metamorphosed during the final stages of the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic orogenic event, deformation that led to the formation of the syn-orogenic conglomerates of the Buona Vista Formation. Following this, two distinct Lower Cretaceous sedimentary successions overstepped the Jurong and Sentosa group strata, including the Kusu Formation and the Bukit Batok Formation, both deposited in the southern part of the Tembeling Basin. A series of Neogene to Quaternary formations overly the Mesozoic and Palaeozoic stratigraphy, including the Fort Canning Formation, Bedok Formation and the Kallang Group.

TI Heterogeneous strain regime at the west of the Ogasawara Plateau in the

AB The Ogasawara Plateau has a major control on the geology of the region between the Izu-Bonin and Mariana subduction zones. This region is important for understanding active collisional zones. We attempt to illustrate the stress field in the Wadati-Benioff zone of this region through seismic estimations. 49 events (M >= 3.5) are chosen for waveform inversion by the ISOLA software to distinguish the stress field. According to available focal mechanism solutions, the heterogeneous stress field parameters are determined for several depth ranges. Based on the epicentral distribution and seismic stress field, the subduction system at the west of the Ogasawara Plateau can be divided into three segments separated by 26.5 degrees N and 24 degrees N. At depths of 0-50 km in the outer-trench slope, the slab is characterized by a varying stress filed. The best-fit stress model with horizontal sigma(3) and vertical sigma(1) is related to the plate bending and preexisting faults. For the central segment, the solutions present a compressional stress regime in the outer-trench slope without preexisting faults, induced by the resistance of the buoyant plateau. The solutions for the depth range of 0-50 km in the forearc region, sigma(1) coincides with the plate convergence and sigma(3) dips steeply to the west in the northern and central segments, controlled by the friction effect and convergence of the plates. However, this depth range in the southern segment shows an extensional stress range, associated with subduction of older slab segment, relatively low rate of plate convergence and the morphological adjustment of the slab between different segments. At depths of 50-200 km, the inhomogeneous stress field exhibits a complicated extensional stress system with strike-slip focal mechanisms. At depths of 200-400 km, the seismicity presents a pronounced seismic gap and the stress field cannot be determined. The seismic gap may be attributed to the missing or tear of the subducting slab, which is caused by the subduction of the buoyant Ogasawara Plateau. The mechanism solutions are characterized by an inhomogeneous strain regime below 400 km, driven by gravity and strong contortion of the slab and resistance to penetration of the 660-km discontinuity. In contrast, there are little earthquakes below 400 km in the southern region of the Ogasawara Plateau.

AB Two major tectonic units in NE Asia are the Sims-Korean (or North China) and South China Blocks that collided in the Permo-Triassic periods. The South China Block is suggested to extend eastward to the Korean Peninsula across the southern Yellow Sea. The Gunsan Basin is a well-defined, fault-bounded sedimentary basin in the SE Yellow Sea and is regarded as a structural link of the South China Block to the Korean Peninsula. We collected deep seismic sounding data recorded on ocean bottom seismometers to investigate how the crustal structure and nature of the South China Block vary in the Gunsan Basin toward the middle part of the Korean Peninsula. The main part of the Gunsan Basin is underlain by relatively thin (similar to 10 km thick) upper and much thicker (similar to 20 km thick) lower crustal layers, indicating a close affinity to the South China Block; whereas it shows distinction from the Korean Peninsula underlain by upper and lower crustal layers with equal (similar to 15 km) thickness. A change in crustal structure is recognized under the eastern margin of the Gunsan Basin toward the Korean Peninsula, that features a transition to the Korean Peninsula. The thick lower crustal layer in the Gunsan Basin appears to be inherited from the evolution of the South China Block including crustal shortening associated with the assembly of Rodinia in the Neoproterozoic before the collision between the Sino-Korean and South China Blocks.

AB The nature of how the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and its seasonality respond to warmer climate is critical knowledge to predict future climates under the expected anthropogenic warming scenario. In this study, a sub-fossil Tridacna gigas specimen was collected from the northern SCS and AMS(14)C dating suggested that the animal lived around AD 1099, during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) interval, the most recent natural warm period of the late Holocene. Monthly Sr/Ca ratios were determined by the ICP-OES measurements and a 30-year long SST record was calculated based on a Sr/Ca-SST calibration equation. The results showed that the SST seasonality for this 30-year window around AD 1099 was about 3.11 degrees C, which is smaller than the modern warm period (i.e., about 4.36 degrees C for AD 1994 similar to 2005 interval). This new result is consistent with another published Tridacna gigas record that was dated around AD 990 from the northern SCS. The signals of ENSO activity were also extracted from the reconstructed SST record and statistical analyses yielded 9 El Nino events and 8 La Nina events within the 30-year record, indicating that the frequency of ENSO activity around AD 1099 was similar to the modern instrumental period.

AB The Sumatran subduction zone has been seismically very active compared with other major subduction zones in the world. Since 2004, a sequence of large earthquakes ruptured along the trench, including the 2004 M-w 9.2 Sumatra-Andaman, the 2005 M-w 8.6 Nias-Simeulue, the 2007 M-w 8.4 Bengkulu, the 2010 M-w 7.8 Mentawai tsunami earthquakes and numerous moderate and small events. These earthquakes released stress over tens of seconds to minutes, disturbing the lithosphere and asthenosphere across a broad region. As earthquake-introduced stress disturbance can trigger tremendous aftershocks and sometimes precipitate large earthquakes in their vicinity, gaining a detailed picture of spatial and temporal stress evolution on the fault and its neighboring faults is crucial for seismic forecasting. Here, we have developed spatiotemporal Coulomb stress models for the Sumatran region, which includes the Sumatran subduction zone and the Sumatran fault, using a well-studied postseismic model. This postseismic model is constrained by decade-long time series of geodetic observations from the Sumatran GPS Array (SuGAr) and from tide gauge data in Southeast Asia. We show that Coulomb stress changes imparted by co- and post-seismic processes of previous great ruptures could well explain the temporal and spatial connection between seismicity and stress evolution. Most importantly, our results reveal that the stress in the Mentawai seismic gap of the Sumatran subduction zone was loaded by more than two bars. These stress perturbations could potentially trigger the rupture of the Mentawai seismic gap, which was already overdue in the last seismic cycle. Now, the likelihood for the failure of this gap is even higher than before 2004. We also find that along the Sumatran fault stress has increased to more than one bar, which may explain the surrounding seismicity. Consequently, we highlight the considerable seismic hazard and associated tsunami threat to the neighboring regions.

AB Estimation of pore pressure and in-situ vertical stress magnitude is essential for understanding the geomechanical behavior of the gas hydrate sediments in deep offshore of the Mahanadi basin. The basin located at northern side of eastern continental margin of India (ECMI) contains gas hydrate in clay/silt sediments. The pore pressure and vertical stress are mapped on two 2D-multi channel seismic data of lines (MH-38A and MH-38B) with aid of information of three wells (namely NGHP-01-19, NGHP-01-09 and NGHP-01-08). Initially, the coefficients of best fit curve have been computed from velocity-effective stress plot for the individual wells and applied on the seismic velocity to transform into the effective stress. The vertical stress has been computed from both the seismic and log data. Therefore, the pore pressure is predicted by subtracting the effective stress from the vertical stress. The pore pressure have been mapped in gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) and sediments below bottom simulating reflector (BSR). The pore pressure and vertical stress gradient are 10.11 MPa/km and 10.67 MPa/km, respectively. The pore pressure and vertical stress from seismic data are closely matched at well location with excellent goodness of fit (R-2) varying from 0.82 to 0.95. Normal pressure is observed in the gas hydrate bearing sediments but slightly high pressures are noticed below the BSR indicating presence of free gas. The pore pressure from seismic data will guide drillers for choosing the mud weight during well drilling and casing optimizing in other part of deep offshore in the Mahanadi basin.

AB GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) observation is complicated by the presence of noise, local benchmark motion, un-modeled atmospheric and other effects. More subtle signals have existed the individual GNSS time series but have undetected due to its low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We introduce here a new method to extract spatially and temporally coherent signals by analyzing data from entire GNSS networks simultaneously using free-net solutions. Daily GNSS network is performed a similarity transformation by constraining one location and one direction. The deformation signal is extracted by analyzing the change of the GNSS geometry net-form integrating the location, baseline length and direction information of all GNSS stations from entire networks. Combined with area strain, the deformation characteristic are further interpreted. We apply the method for the 2013 Lushan M-s 7.0 earthquake and find a significant pre-seismic deformation anomaly with the locked status and negative acceleration in the first shear strain and direction change time series, implying a strong sinistral shear tectonic forces have happened in seismic source area and can intensify the pregnancy of the earthquake. The phenomena can be well supported and explained by the experiment results of rock fracture in the laboratory. It's inferred that a processes from stable locked status to negative acceleration change may be the most characteristic of pre-seismic deformation.

AB Cenozoic (similar to 40-30 Ma) high-Mg potassic volcanic rocks are abundant in the Jinshajiang-Ailaoshan magmatic belt that stretches from eastern Tibet to western Yunnan. The petrogenesis and compositional variation of the mantle source of these rocks are poorly known. In this paper, we obtained U-Pb zircon ages and whole-rock major and trace element and Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic data for these volcanic rocks from the Nangqian basin in the Eastern Qiangtang block, eastern Tibet. High-Mg volcanic rocks in Nangqian are potassic trachybasalts, shoshonites and latites and contain 6.49-10.54 wt% MgO, 48.04-56.89 wt% SiO2 and 3.36-4.14 wt% K2O, with K2O/Na2O ratios of 0.94-L24. Zircon U-Pb dating shows that they are slightly older (40-38 Ma) than their counterparts (37-32 Ma) from the Dali district, western Yunnan. They are enriched in large ion lithophile elements (LILEs) and light rare earth elements (LREEs) and have significantly negative Nb-Ta-Ti anomalies. Isotopically, they have primitive mantle-like Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.7050-0.7055) and eNd(t) values of -1.06 to +0.10 and restricted ranges of Pb-206/Pb-204 (18.63-18.71), Pb-207/Pb-204 (15.52-15.57) and Pb-208/Pb-204 ratios (38.42-38.59). Zircon eHf(t) values vary from +4.1 to +9.4 and are thus decoupled from their whole-rock Nd isotope ratios. Previous studies have shown that Cenozoic high-Mg potassic volcanic rocks in the Dali district have more enriched Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic compositions, higher LILE/HFSE (high field strength elements) and LILE/LREE ratios but less enrichment in LREE than the counterparts from the Nangqian basin. Geochemical differences between high-Mg volcanic rocks from these two locations can be explained by different mantle sources caused by different metasomatic processes. Underneath the Nangqian basin, a juvenile, isotopically "depleted", and garnet-bearing lithospheric mantle was metasomatized by Paleozoic and Cenozoic subduction, whereas an ancient (probably as old as Neoproterozoic), fertilized, and spinel fades-dominated lithospheric mantle was metasomatized by Neoproterozoic subduction underneath the Dali district.

AB Potassic igneous rocks, such as shoshonitic rocks, are an important constituent of young volcanic-intrusive suites in varied tectonic settings. The genesis of these rocks is related to tectonic environments and is thus important for tectonic reconstruction of ancient terranes. Here we report zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopes and whole-rock geochemical compositions for shoshonitic quartz syenites from Madi and Chashan in the northern Wuyi Mt Range, southeast China. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating shows that both the Madi and Chashan quartz syenites were formed at 134.8 Ma and 135.0 Ma, respectively. They also have similar geochemical compositions and are characterized by high K2O contents and enriched in LILEs and LREEs but depleted in HFSEs, suggesting a shoshonitic affinity. Elemental and isotopic compositions indicate that they were likely formed by partial melting of metasomatised lithospheric mantle with the presence of phlogopite and potassic amphibole. It is also suggested that silicate melts derived from subducted sediments played a dominant role in mantle metasomatism. An integration of our new results with previous ones allows us to propose a modified tectonic model about the evolution of SE China in which a continental arc related to the subduction of the Palaeo-Pacific plate during the Middle Jurassic was gradually changed to southeastward-migrating, extension-related magmatic arc and backarc basins formed in a continental arc-rifting setting as a consequence of slab rollback since the Early Cretaceous.

AB Understanding the response of past soil erosion to climate change and human disturbances is quite essential for managing and preventing soil erosion in the future. Here, we report a high-resolution soil erosion sequence during the past 2000 years based on grain-size data from a sediment core GS07A in Tianchi Lake in the Chinese Loess Plateau. These grain-size data are analysed by end-member modelling and further deciphered by detailed modern investigations of surface sediments, surface soils, and modern dust samples aided by published grain-size distribution characteristics of different depositional provenances and processes. Six strong soil erosion periods, including more than 20 serious soil erosion events, are inferred at 150-300 CE, 450-750 CE, 900-1100 CE, 1200-1400 CE, 1650-1800 CE, and 1950-2000 CE. These soil erosion records correspond well with intensive flood events in downstream rivers and the neighbouring Longxi area documented from the historical literature, suggesting that regional high-intensity rainfall or flood events are the main cause of soil erosion. Vegetation cover in the catchment also influenced soil erosion: light vegetation cover aggravated soil erosion even in the periods with a low frequency of flooding, while heavy cover reduced soil erosion even in the periods with a high frequency of flooding. Our results highlight the role of sustainable land use and vegetation restoration around the catchment in controlling soil erosion in the Chinese Loess Plateau.

AB The correlation of East Asian summer and winter monsoons (EASM and EAWM) is believed to be variable at various timescales and under different climate backgrounds. In order to address this issue, high-resolution delta O-18 (depleted values indicating a strong EASM) and delta C-13 records (depleted values representing a weak EAWM) from three stalagmites, covering Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 4 and 3, are reconstructed from an alpine cave in central China During MIS 4, millennial-scale changes are clear in delta O-18 and delta C-13 records, while the delta C-13 is only characterized by centennial-scale variability across MIS 3. Changes in these speleothem delta C-13 records are supported by pollen records from the same area, which suggested millennial-scale alternations between conifer and deciduous broadleaf forests during MIS 4 and a stable C3-type vegetation in MIS 3. After detrended, delta O-18 changes are positively correlated with the delta C-13 record at a centennial scale, indicating an anti-phase of EASM and EAWM. In early MIS 4, however, an in-phase relationship of EASM and EAWM can be observed at a millennial scale. Thus, an anti-phased EASM/EAWM can be expected at a centennial scale, while a complicated correlation is seen at a millennial scale. These results imply a variable EASM/EAWM phase relationship under varying climatic conditions through the geological records and at different timescales.

AB Glioblastoma is a grade IV malignant glioma with high recurrence and metastasis and faces a therapeutic obstacle that the blood-brain barrier (BBB) severely hinders the brain entry and efficacy of therapeutic drugs. Previous studies suggest that borneol (BO) has been used to enhance interested drugs to penetrate the BBB. In this study, a borneol-modified nanomicelle delivery system was established to facilitate the brain entry of doxorubicin for glioblastoma therapy. Herein, we firstly conjugated borneol molecules with DSPE-PEG(2000)-COOH to synthesize a novel carrier DSPE-PEG(2000)-BO and also characterized its structure. Doxorubicin-loaded nanomicelles (DOX BO-PMs) were prepared using DSPE-PEG(2000)-BO via electrostatic interaction and the physicochemical properties were investigated. The average particle size and zeta potential of DOX BO-PMs were respectively (14.95 +/- 0.17)nm and ( -1.27 +/- 0.06)mV, and the drug encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity in DOX BO-PMs were (95.69 +/- 0.49)% and (14.62 +/- 0.39)%, respectively. The drug release of the DOX BO-PMs exhibited a both time- and pH-dependent pattern. The results demonstrated that DOX BO-PMs significantly enhanced the transport efficiency of DOX across the BBB and also exhibited a quick accumulation in the brain tissues. The in vitro anti-proliferation assay results suggested that DOX BO-PMs exerted a strong inhibitory effect on proliferation of glioblastoma cells. Importantly, in vivo antitumor results demonstrated that DOX BO-PMs significantly inhibited the tumor growth and metastasis of glioblastoma. In conclusion, DOX BO-PMs can improve the glioblastoma therapeutic outcomes and become a promising nanodrug candidate for the application of doxorubicin in the field of glioblastoma therapy.

AB Candida albicans, as the main causative fungus of vaginal candidiasis, is currently a global issue of concern due to its high prevalence, biofilm formation and emergence of resistance. Ketoconazole (KTZ), an antifungal drug, which has poor water-solubility and penetration capacity, is ineffective against deep-seated Candida infection. Considering these issues, this work aimed to develop a novel multifunctional carrier for KTZ via encapsulation of KTZ/beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) co-ground mixture into chitosan/gellan gum gel-flakes (threadlike and polygonal structures). Analytical studies revealed existence of electrostatic-derived complexes between negatively charged gellan gum and positively charged chitosan. Gel-flakes were then loaded in in situ gel of pluronic F-127 (PF-127). Based on gelation temperature (T-gel), viscosity and release studies; selected formulation was further evaluated, showing significant in vitro anti-candida activity. Despite reduced dosage regimen (50 mg/daily/three days), KTZ flakes in situ gel was as effective as Gynoconazol vaginal cream (R) (80 mg terconazole/daily/three days) in improving patient complaints and Candida eradication. Multifunctionality of KTZ carrier was based on efficient spreading and coating of the vagina due to free-flowing properties during application, flakes entanglement within folded vaginal epithelia, sustained release and increased penetration capacity of KTZ to reach deep-seated infections. In conclusion, flakes in situ gel could be considered as a highly promising KTZ delivery option for treatment of vaginal candidiasis.

TI Conception of nanosized hybrid liposome/poloxamer particles to thicken

ID RELEASE; MICELLIZATION
AB Liposomes are nanocarriers composed of phospholipids, especially designed to potentially carry drugs. However, liposomes suffer in terms of leakage of small hydrophilic drugs. To control the release, a system with lipid shell and polymeric viscous core, namely Hybrid liposome/polymer inside (HLPin), has been designed. For this purpose, we setup a syringe pump apparatus equipped with homemade tubing system. HLPin formulation consisting of poloxamer (5% w/v) was found to be optimal when produced at injection rates of 5 mL. min(-1). Then, we tend to characterize the HLPin with DLS, TEM, TRPS, thermal analysis and densitometry in comparison with a polymer added after formation of the liposomes. The optimal formulation was evaluated for its stability and cytotoxicity. The selected conditions and composition resulted in nanocarriers which are highly reproducible with mono-disperse size distribution with an average size of 206 +/- 4.8 nm and a polydispersity index of 0.15 +/- 0.015. Densitometry and thermal analysis results confirmed the formation of HLPin. Interestingly, HLPin were stable over 2 months, produced no cytotoxicity and exhibited slow release of rhodamine and Doxorubicin in comparison to liposome formulation. Our homemade tubing system coupled with syringe pump apparatus achieved reproducible, precisely controlled production for the HLPin formulation which can be scale up.

AB An open wound is highly susceptible to microbial infection leading to elevated level of inflammatory response. For prompt healing, a wound requires a biomimetic dressing material with ideal hydrophilicity and tensile strength, possessing antimicrobial and antioxidant property. Although PCL-based nanofibers have sufficient tensile strength and biocompatibility, it lacks in terms of optimum hydrophilicity and biodegradation. Therefore, we fabricated a PCL-gelatin based electrospun nanofibers, enriched with quercetin and ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (CH). The average diameter of developed nanofibers was 725.943 +/- 201.965 nm, and devoid of chemical interaction between two drugs and polymers. CH and quercetin exhibited biphasic in-vitro release in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The in-vitro antibacterial and antioxidant property of scaffolds were evaluated by film-diffusion against Staphylococcus aureus and DPPH assay, respectively. The addition of gelatin along with CH and quercetin enhanced the hydrophilicity (contact angle = 48.8 +/- 2.95 degrees) and biodegradation rate of the nanofibers. In-vitro biocompatibility of scaffold was examined by hemocompatibility and fibroblast viability using MTT assay. The results confirm the direct application of scaffold in the wounded area. Further, complete closure of full-thickness wound within 16 days, and regulation of hydroxyproline, SOD and catalase level in granulation tissues following treatment with scaffold, confirmed its application for accelerated wound healing.

AB Controlled distribution of a drug by its association to a nanocarrier is a promising approach for the treatment of pregnancy disorders such as preeclampsia. For this application, tracking both the nanocarrier and the drug is necessary to ensure the safety of both the mother and the foetus. This study reports a method to visualize and quantify the uptake of liposomal formulations in placental tissue using florescent labelling and appropriate analytical tools. Lipoplexes were labelled with a fluorescent lipid, DOPE-NBD while the encapsulated siRNA was fluorescently labelled with rhodamine. Lipoplexes were incubated with villous placenta explants, explants were imaged with confocal microscopy, then DOPE-NBD was extracted from the explant and quantified by HPLC. Qualitative evaluation by confocal microscopy showed the presence of lipoplexes and siRNA into the outer layer of the placental explants, the syncytiotrophoblast. For quantitative evaluation, an HPLC method for the quantification of fluorescent lipid DOPE-NBD in placental tissue was developed and validated. The developed method was applied to quantify the DOPE-NBD uptake in the placental tissue. Increased amounts of DOPE-NBD were detected in placental explants when increasing the incubation concentration of lipoplexes. This study provides a method to evaluate the interactions between liposomal formulation and the placental barrier.

AB The focus of this work was to explore feasibility of using blends of cellulose esters (CA 320S, CA 3980-10 or CAB 171-15) and enteric polymers (C-A-P, Eudragit (R) L100 or HPMCP HP-55) for delayed and enteric coating of tablets containing either diclofenac sodium (DFS, high dose) or prednisone (PDS, low dose) drug. The core tablets of DFS or PDS were coated with polymer blends to achieve approximate weight gain of 5% and 10%. The coated tablets were characterized for dissolution (0.1 N HCl and phosphate buffer pH 6.8) and surface morphology. The surface morphology of CA 398-10 or CAB 171-15 based polymer blends was rough and fibrous. Less than 0.5% drug was dissolved in 120 min from 5% w/w coated tablets in acid-phase dissolution testing. The dissolution in phosphate buffer pH 6.8 medium varied from 16.2 +/- 0.2 to 98 +/- 2.1%, and 30.1 +/- 0.5% to 101.7 +/- 3.4% in 120 min from DFS and PDS coated tablets, respectively. Dissolution was less in CA 320S based blends compared to CA 398-10 or CAB 171-15 blends in phosphate buffer medium. Furthermore, there were no significant differences observed in dissolution profiles of coated tablets of DFS or PDS. This can be explained by dose of the drugs. Additionally, dissolution was higher in tablets coated with enteric polymer alone compared with the blends. In conclusion, core tablets can be coated with cellulose ester and enteric polymers blend to impart both delayed and enteric release feature to the tablets containing hydrophilic or hydrophobic drug.

AB This study investigates the effects of drug-loaded nanofibers on the solubility of the poorly water-soluble drug, loratadine. Amorphous morphologies of electrospun loratadine nanofibers were prepared using a low-cost 3D-printed electrospinning setup with counter-flow air for the rapid production of nanofibers. Polyvinylpyrrolidone was used as a carrier polymer and ethanol as a solvent in the solution preparation. The prepared nanofibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, solubility and in vitro dissolution studies with kinetic behavior evaluation. The scanning electron microscope images showed smooth nanofiber surfaces with a mean diameter of 372 nm. Moreover, both differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the amorphous state of the prepared nanofibers. FT-IR results suggested that loratadine lost its original crystal structure by hydrogen bonding interactions. The fabricated nanofibrous drug samples demonstrated a remarkable 26-fold increase in solubility when compared to the pure drug in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. Furthermore, dissolution studies showed that 66% of the drug from the nanofibrous mat was released in the first 10 min, which is significantly higher than the maximum of 4% drug release of the reference samples within the same time. Thus, Loratadine nanofibers can be considered as an alternative dosage form with improved physicochemical properties.

AB Resveratrol is a potent anti-oxidant agent and can be used for the effective management of different skin conditions like extrinsic skin ageing, psoriasis, etc. The objective of this research was to develop a dermal delivery system of resveratrol for its improved dermatological benefits for achieving its enhanced skin deposition profile with limited systemic exposure. Resveratrol loaded ethosomal hydrogel was developed and optimized using systematic Quality by Design approach. Firstly, the quality target product profile (QTPP) of ethosomal formulation was defined and critical quality attributes (CQAs) and critical material attributes (CMAs) were screened through risk assessment studies based on fish bone diagram. 3(2) full factorial design using Design Expert software was employed to optimize the selected CMAs. Concentration of phospholipid (X1) and concentration of ethanol (X2) were selected as independent CMAs. Vesicle size (Y1), entrapment efficiency (Y2), permeation flux (Y3) and drug deposition in dermal layer (Y4) were evaluated as dependant CQAs. Optimized formulation was then evaluated for physicochemical and skin permeation properties. Ethosomal hydrogel was able to significantly enhance the skin permeation parameters and skin deposition of resveratrol in comparison to the conventional cream. The results were highly ratified by CLSM studies in which ethosomal hydrogel was found to be vastly scattered in the deeper skin layers. Thus, there is evidence that systemically developed ethosomal gel can deliver enhanced amounts of bioactives into the skin and it is expected that a number of products for dermal/transdermal applications will be developed in the future based on it.

AB Industry 4.0 aims to integrate manufacturing operations into a seamless digital whole by incorporating flexibility, agility, re-configurability, and sustainability. The result of this integration is a "smart factory" that is more lean, agile, and flexible in operations. There are valid reasons, and perhaps requirements, for pharmaceutical industries to embrace smart factory and to "borrow" the concept of Industry 4.0 to give rise to "Pharma 4.0" (i.e., the pharmaceutical version of Industry 4.0). This paper proposes a cyber-physical-based PAT framework called CPbPAT for implementing smart manufacturing systems in the pharmaceutical industry. The framework has been developed using an agent-based system and is presented by a standard system modeling language called the Unified Modeling Language (UML). The pharmaceutical manufacturing system shown in "Quality by Design for ANDAs" is used as a case study to illustrate the application of the proposed framework.

AB The application of small interfering RNA (siRNA) cancer therapeutics is limited by several extra- and intracellular barriers including the presence of ribonucleases that degrade siRNA, the premature clearance, the impermeability of the cell membrane, or the difficulty to escape endo-lysosomal degradation. Therefore, several delivery systems have emerged to overcome these limitations and to successfully deliver siRNA to the tumor site. This review is focused on polymer-based siRNA nanovectors which exploit the negative charge of siRNA, representing a major challenge for siRNA delivery, to their advantage by loading siRNA via electrostatic assembly. These nanovectors are easy to prepare and to adapt for an optimal gene silencing efficiency. The ability of electrostatically assembled polymeric siRNA nanovectors (EPSN) to improve the half-life of siRNA, to favor the specificity of the delivery and the accumulation in tumor and to enhance the cellular uptake and endosomal escape for an efficient siRNA delivery will be discussed. Finally, the influence of the versatility of the structure of these nanovectors on the protein down-regulation will be evaluated.

AB The delivery of small drug particles from a dry powder inhaler (DPI) into the patient's peripheral airways requires the dispersion of the powder. In DPIs that contain a rotating pierced capsule, the capsule's motion is paramount to powder dispersion. Previous studies have simplified the capsule motion in an Aerolizer (R) inhaler as a constant rotation around a fixed center. The present work examines deviations from this simplified motion and describes the capsule collisions with the surrounding inhaler walls. High-speed photography was employed to analyze the motion of a size 3 capsule in an Aerolizer (R) inhaler at various flow rates ranging from 30 to 100 L/min. Frequent collisions of the capsule with the surrounding inhaler walls were observed. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations indicated that the air flow through the capsule governs the behavior of small drug particles, while inertial forces are the dominant influence on large carrier particles in the capsule. Discrete element method (DEM) simulations were employed to study the effect of the capsule-inhaler collisions on the powder discharge from a rotating capsule. The collisions vastly improved the discharge of a polydisperse model carrier powder from the capsule over a wide range of cohesiveness.

AB Stimuli-responsive polymeric nanostructures have emerged as potential drug carriers for cancer therapy. Herein, we synthesized redox-responsive diselenide bond containing amphiphilic polymer, Bi(mPEG-PLGA)-Se-2 from mPEG-PLGA and 3,3'-diselanediyldipropanoic acid (DSeDPA) using DCC/DMAP as coupling agents. Due to its amphiphilic nature, Bi(mPEG-PLGA)-Se-2 self-assembled in to stable micelles in aqueous solution with a hydrodynamic size of 123.9 +/- 0.85 nm. The Bi(mPEG-PLGA)-Se-2 micelles exhibited DOX-loading content (DLC) of 6.61 wt% and encapsulation efficiency (EE) of 54.9%. The DOX-loaded Bi(mPEG-PLGA)-Se-2 micelles released 73.94% and 69.54% of their cargo within 72 h upon treatment with 6 mM GSH and 0.1% H2O2, respectively, at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C. The MTT assay results demonstrated that Bi(mPEG-PLGA)-Se-2 was devoid of any inherent toxicity and the DOX-loaded micelles showed pronounced antitumor activities against HeLa cells, 44.46% of cells were viable at maximum dose of 7.5 mu g/mL. The cellular uptake experiment further confirmed the internalization of DOX-loaded Bi(mPEG-PLGA)-Se-2 micelles and endowed redox stimuli triggered drug release in cytosol and nuclei of cancer cells. Overall, the results suggested that the smart, biocompatible Bi(mPEG-PLGA)-Se-2 copolymer could serve as potential drug delivery biomaterial for the controlled release of hydrophobic drugs in cancer cells.

AB As a new strategy for treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ, biocompatible and bioadhesive nanoemulsions for intraductal administration of the cytotoxic agent piplartine (piperlongumine) were optimized in this study. To confer bioadhesive properties, the nanoemulsion was modified with chitosan or hyaluronic acid. Tricaprylin was selected as the nanoemulsion non-polar phase due to its ability to dissolve larger drug amounts compared to isopropyl myristate and monocaprylin. Use of phosphatidylcholine as sole surfactant did not result in a homogeneous nanoemulsion, while its association with polysorbate 80 and glycerol (in a surfactant blend) led to the formation of nanoemulsions with droplet size of 76.5 +/- 1.2 nm. Heating the aqueous phase to 50 degrees C enabled sonication time reduction from 20 to 10 min. Inclusion of either chitosan or hyaluronic acid resulted in nanoemulsions with similar in vitro bioadhesive potential, and comparable ability to prolong mammary tissue retention (to 120 h) in vivo without causing undesirable histological alterations. Piplartine was stable in both nanoemulsions for 60 days; however, the size of loaded NE-HA was maintained at a similar range for longer periods of time, suggesting that this nanoemulsion may be a stronger candidate for intraductal delivery.

AB The aim of this work was to develop a PAT platform consisting of four complementary instruments for the characterization of electrospun amorphous solid dispersions with meloxicam. The investigated methods, namely NIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Colorimetry and Image analysis were tested and compared considering the ability to quantify the active pharmaceutical ingredient and to detect production errors reflected in inhomogeneous deposition of fibers. Based on individual performance the calculated RMSEP values ranged between 0.654% and 2.292%. Mid-level data fusion consisting of data compression through latent variables and application of ANN for regression purposes proved efficient, yielding an RMSEP value of 0.153%. Under these conditions the model could be validated accordingly on the full calibration range. The complementarity of the PAT tools, demonstrated from the perspective of captured variability and outlier detection ability, contributed to model performance enhancement through data fusion. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first application of data fusion in the field of PAT for efficient handling of big-analytical-data provided by high-throughput instruments.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS

DE Porosity; Dehydration; Helium pycnometry; True density; Hydrate
   stability; Energy framework
AB Mechanical properties of a material, such as hardness and elastic modulus, depend on porosity exponentially. Thus, an accurate characterization of material mechanical properties requires correct porosity, which depends on the accuracy of measured true density. Helium pycnometry is the most common technique for determining true density of a powder material but it is not suitable for materials containing volatile components. For unstable hydrates, dehydration during measurement releases water and invalidates the ideal gas law used for calculating sample volume. Consequently, measured true density is over-estimated, which causes gross errors in mechanical properties extrapolated to zero porosity. This work shows that physical stability and the dehydration kinetics, determined by both water-bonding structures and bonding energy, directly affect the magnitude of error in measured true density.

AB Aptamers, nucleic acid ligands that are specific against their corresponding targets are increasingly employed in a variety of applications including diagnostics and therapeutics. The specificity of the aptamers against their targets is also used as the basis for the formulation of the aptamer-based drug delivery system. In this review, we aim to provide an overview on the chaperoning roles of aptamers in acting as the cargo or load carriers, delivering contents to the targeted sites via cell surface receptors. Internalization of the aptamer-biomolecule conjugates via receptor-mediated endocytosis and the strategies to augment the rate of endocytosis are underscored. The cargos chaperoned by aptamers, ranging from siRNAs to DNA origami are illuminated. Possible impediments to the aptamer-based drug deliveries such as susceptibility to nuclease resistance, potentiality for immunogenicity activation, tumor heterogeneity are speculated and the corresponding amendment strategies to address these shortcomings are discussed. We prophesy that the future of the aptamer-based drug delivery will take a trajectory towards DNA nanorobot-based assay.

TI The role of chitosan as coating material for nanostructured lipid

ID SOLID NANOPARTICLES; NANOMATERIALS
AB Fucoxanthin (FUCO) is a marine carotenoid characterized by antiproliferative properties against hyperproliferative cells. The aim of this work was to design and develop nanostructured lipidic carriers (NLCs) based on bacuri butter and tucuma oil and loaded with FUCO, intended for skin application to prevent skin hyperproliferative diseases and in particular psoriasis. The presence of FUCO should control the hyperproliferation of skin diseased cells and the lipids forming the NLC core, rich in antioxidants and characterized by wound healing properties, should favor the restoring of skin integrity. NLCs were coated with chitosan (CS) to improve their biopharmaceutical properties (bio/mucoadhesion and wound healing) and to combine the advantages of lipidic nanoparticles with the biological properties of CS. Chitosan coated and non-coated NLC were prepared by means of high shear homogenization and characterized for chemico-physical and biopharmaceutical properties (in vitro biocompatibility and cell uptake towards normal dermal human fibroblasts). Moreover, the pharmacological activity of FUCO loaded in NLCs was assessed in psoriatic-like cellular model. NLCs were characterized by dimensions ranging from about 250 to 400 nm. Moreover, the CS coating and FUCO loading determined an increase of size. Moreover, TEM and zeta potential analysis confirmed the presence of CS coating on nanoparticle surface, thus conferring to nanoparticle good bioadhesion properties. NLCs uptake in fibroblasts was observed and NLC-FUCO-CS caused a reduction of cell viability with a less marked effect in fibroblasts rather than in psoriatic cells, highlighting the capability of this system to control skin hyperproliferation and inflammation. The loading of NLC-FUCO-CS in pullulan film should render NLCs application easy, without impair prompt interaction of the drug with the skin. Considering the overall results skin application of CS coated NLCs loaded with FUCO seems a promising approach to control skin hyperproliferation and to preserve skin integrity in psoriatic skin.

AB Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are often used as transporter systems to deliver various therapeutic agents into the cell. We developed a novel machine learning application which can quantitatively screen the insertion/interaction potential of various CPPs into three model phospholipid monolayers. An artificial neural network (ANN) was designed, trained, and ultimately tested on an external dataset using Langmuir experimental data for 13 CPPs (hydrophilic and amphiphilic) together with various features related to the insertion/interaction efficiency of CPPs. The trained ANN provided accurate predictions of the maximum change in surface pressure of CPPs when injected below three membrane models at pH 7.4. The accuracy of predictions was high for the dataset which was used to construct the model (r(2) = 0.986) as well as for the external "prospective" dataset (r(2) = 0.969). In conclusion, this study demonstrates the promising potential of ANNs for screening the insertion potential of CPPs into membrane models for efficient intracellular delivery of therapeutic agents.

AB Despite eye drops generally represent the most convenient, simple and patient-friendly formulations to treat ocular diseases, they suffer from poor retention on the ocular surface and low drug bioavailability leading to the necessity of prolonged and continuous treatment over time. Therefore, ocular insert could represent an innovative way to benefit from ocular topical administration while minimizing all the relevant limitation related to this route of administration. Polymeric non-erodible mucoadhesive ocular inserts should be comfortable and should rapidly adhere on the ocular surface, remain in situ for prolonged period, assure a reproducible and controlled drug release as well as act as transcorneal absorption promoters. In this study, a well-known aliphatic polyester, poly(1,4-butylene succinate) (PBS), was used as starting material to produce hydrophobic microfibrillar scaffolds by means of electrospinning technique. Plasma-assisted chemical surface functionalization of the PBS scaffolds with appropriate biopolymers (inulin, alpha,beta-poly(N-2-hydroxyethyl)-D,L-aspartamide, heparin) was carried out to confer to the final ocular inserts ad hoc properties as wettability, mucoadhesion and cyto-compatibility on human corneal epithelial cells, by improving surface hydrophilicity without modifying the bulk properties of the material. The lipophilic drug triamcinolone acetonide was loaded into the obtained ocular insert and release studies were carried out to demonstrate the ability of drug loaded inserts to release the active until 30 days.

ID SOLUBILITY
AB Manufacturing poorly water-soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) with sufficient bioavailability is a significant challenge in pharmaceutical research. A higher bioavailability can reduce both the applied dosage and the side effects for the patient. One method of increasing the bioavailability is to reduce the particle size of the drug down to the nanoscale.
   An innovative procedure for the preparation of particles in the submicron size range is spray drying with aerosol conditioning, followed by subsequent separation of the particles in an electrostatic precipitator (ESP). This process has been tested before in an earlier work with aqueous model substances at high production rates (1 g/h) and narrow particle-size distributions (mannitol: d(50)(,0) = 455 nm, span = 0,8) in the submicron range.
   Spray drying from an aqueous solution with low drug concentrations ( < 1 wt-%) leads to particles in the lower nanosize range, but the low concentrations make this process inefficient. A custom-made plant was modified in order to handle the organic spray-drying process. In addition, explosion protection had to be considered. This work focuses on the spray drying of submicron particles from organic solvents for the purpose of increasing the dissolution rate of the API griseofulvin.
   API particles were successfully produced in the submicron size-range, characterized and the dissolution behavior was investigated. The dissolution time to dissolve 80% of the drug, t(80), was reduced from 21.5 min for the micronized grade API to 8.5 min for the submicron product.

AB To encapsulate and deliver poorly water-soluble drugs, castor oil/silica hybrid microparticles (HMP) s were synthesized. Green chemistries were used to silylate the oil and further cross-link it into solid microparticles by sol-gel reaction. Silylated castor oils (ICO) s at various silylation ratios were prepared and allowed the solubilization of ibuprofen at several concentrations up to 16 wt%. The HMPs were formulated by ThermoStabilized Emulsion (TSE) process which permits to "freeze" the oil-in-water emulsion while the sol-gel reaction occurs.
   The hybrid mineral/organic composition and the morphology (spherical shape and micrometric size) of these HMPs were determined by complementary technics (SEM, TGA, EDX, Si-29 NMR and FTIR spectroscopies).
   The HMPs reached a good ibuprofen loading efficiency regardless to the formulation used while the release kinetics in simulated oral administration exhibited a tunable release during 3 h according to the silylation ratio. The ibuprofen rate also influenced its own amorphous or crystalline character within the HMPs. For subcutaneous conditions, ibuprofen release took place over 15 days. Finally, biodegradability assays in simulated digestion medium suggested a surface-limited hydrolysis of the particles and cytocompatibility studies on NIH-3T3 and Caco-2 cells demonstrated an excellent cellular viability.

AB The effect of non-spherical particle shapes on cellular uptake has been reported as a general design parameter to control cellular recognition of particulate drug carriers. Beside shape, also size and cell-particle ratio should mutually effect phagocytosis. Here, the capability to control cellular uptake of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) based polymer micronetwork colloids (MNC), a carrier system that can be transferred to various shapes, is explored in vitro at test conditions allowing multiple cell-particle contacts. PCL-based MNC were synthesized as spheres with a diameter of similar to 6, similar to 10, and 13 mu m, loaded with a fluorescent dye by a specific technique of swelling, redispersion and drying, and transferred into different ellipsoidal shapes by a phantom stretching method. The boundaries of MNC deformability to prolate ellipsoid target shapes were systematically analyzed and found to be at an aspect ratio AR of similar to 4 as obtained by a phantom elongation epsilon(ph) of similar to 150%. Uptake studies with a murine macrophages cell line showed shape dependency of phagocytosis for selected conditions when varying particle sizes (similar to 6 and 10 mu m),and shapes (epsilon(ph): 0, 75 or 150%), cell-particle ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:10, 1:50), and time points (1-24 h). For larger-sized MNC, there was no significant shape effect on phagocytosis as these particles may associate with more than one cell, thus increasing the possibility of phagocytosis by any of these cells. Accordingly, controlling shape effects on phagocytosis for carriers made from degradable polymers relevant for medical applications requires considering further parameters besides shape, such as kinetic aspects of the exposure and uptake by cells.

AB Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare metabolic disorder with a worldwide prevalence of 1 in every 185,000 live births. However, certain populations display a significant overexpression of the disorder where incidence is reported to be 1 in every 52,541 new-borns. The first-line therapy for MSUD involves a strict dietary leucine restriction and oral supplementation of isoleucine and valine. The dose administered to patients requires strict tailoring according to age, weight and blood levels. In current clinical practice, however, practitioners still have to prepare extemporaneous formulations due to the lack of suitable oral treatments for MSUD. Herein, we evaluate the first time use of 3D printing in a hospital setting for the preparation of personalised therapies with the aim of improving safety and acceptability to isoleucine supplementation in paediatric patients suffering from MSUD. This investigation was a single-centre, prospective crossover experimental study. Four paediatric patients with MSUD (aged 3-16 years) were treated at the Clinic University Hospital in Santiago de Compostela, Spain which is a MSUD reference hospital in Europe. The primary objective was to evaluate isoleucine blood levels after six months of treatment with two types of formulations; conventional capsules prepared by manual compounding and personalised chewable formulations prepared by automated 3D printing. A secondary investigation was to evaluate patient acceptability of 3D printed formulations prepared with different flavours and colours. Isoleucine blood levels in patients were well controlled using both types of formulations, however, the 3D printed therapy showed mean levels closer to the target value and with less variability (200-400 mu M). The 3D printed formulations were well accepted by patients regarding flavour and colour. The study demonstrates for the first time that 3D printing offers a feasible, rapid and automated approach to prepare oral tailored-dose therapies in a hospital setting. 3D printing has shown to be an effective manufacturing technology in producing chewable isoleucine printlets as a treatment of MSUD with good acceptability.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) printing is revolutionising how we envision manufacturing in the pharmaceutical field. Here, we report for the first time the use of direct powder extrusion 3D printing: a novel single-step printing process for the production of printlets (3D printed tablets) directly from powdered materials. This new 3D printing technology was used to prepare amorphous solid dispersions of itraconazole using four different grades of hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC - UL, SSL, SL and L). All of the printlets showed good mechanical and physical characteristics and no drug degradation. The printlets showed sustained drug release characteristics, with drug concentrations higher than the solubility of the drug itself. The printlets prepared with the ultra-low molecular grade (HPC - UL) showed faster drug release compared with the other HPC grades, attributed to the fact that itraconazole was found in a higher percentage as an amorphous solid dispersion. This work demonstrates the potential of this innovate technology to overcome one of the major disadvantages of fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printing by avoiding the need for preparation of filaments by hot melt extrusion (HME). This novel single-step technology could revolutionise the preparation of amorphous solid dispersions as final formulations and it may be especially suited for preclinical studies, where the quantity of drugs is limited and without the need of using traditional HME.

AB Niosomes have been considered as promising nanoscale carriers for ocular drug delivery, since they have been shown to increase the bioavailability of various drugs and to improve their efficacy. The main objective of this study was to prepare and characterize niosomes for ocular delivery of doxycycline hyclate. Niosomes were prepared using various surfactants (namely Span 20, Span 60, Span 80, Tween 60) and cholesterol in different molar ratios, using the thin film hydration method followed by multiple membrane extrusion or the reverse-phase evaporation method. In our hands highest entrapment efficiency was encountered with the formulation composed of Span 60 and cholesterol, prepared by the reverse phase evaporation method. Transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering were used to assess the morphology, size and size distribution paterns of prepared niosomes. In vitro release studies showed sustained release of doxycycline from niosomes. After 2 months of storage at 4 degrees C the doxycycline-loaded niosomes remained physically stable in terms of encapsulation efficiency and particle size. The performed Draize test revealed that the prepared niosomes were well tolerated by the eye. Taken together our findings indicate that niosomes could be considered as a plausible drug delivery platform for for ophthalmic application of doxycycline.

AB Montmorillonite (MMT) is a highly promising material for use in drug delivery due to its high drug loading capacity and controlled drug release properties. MMT protects drug molecules between layered structure; however, drug release from MMT is sustained less than 6 h, which is insufficient for the release of antibiotics. This study sought to synthesize an antibiotic delivery material with more sustained release properties. A ciprofloxacin (CIP)-MMT composite was fabricated using carboxymethylated nanocellulose (CMCNF). A simple adsorption reaction intercalated 31.1% of CIP molecules present into the MMT under optimized conditions (pH 5, CIP = 1000 mg/L, Reaction time = 3 h). The synthesized CIP-MMT composite was fabricated using 1.5, 2, or 3 wt% CMCNF. Increasing the CMCNF content delayed the erosion of the CMCNF matrix and prevented rapid dissolution of the CIP-MMT composite. In vitro release experiments revealed that the CIP-MMT composite material provided the sustained release of CIP over 6 h. Erosion of the 3 wt% CMCNF-CIP-MMT composite occurred slowly and provided 48 h of sustained CIP release. An anti-bacterial test revealed that the 3 wt% CMCNF-CIP-MMT composite displayed the most constant antibacterial activity over 12 days. These results demonstrated that the CMCNF prepared with CIP intercalation in MMT was highly effective in prolonging the antibiotic release.

AB Active pharmaceutical ingredients are composed of single-component or multicomponent crystals. Multicomponent crystals include salts, co-crystals, and solvates. Indinavir sulfate is the ethanol solvate form of indinavir that is known to deliquesce through moisture absorption. However, the detailed behavior of solvent molecules in the crystal has not been investigated. In this study, we studied the desolvation mechanism of indinavir sulfate ethanol and investigated the behavior of solvent molecules in the solid from. Indinavir sulfate ethanol contained 1.7 molecules of ethanol, 0.7 of which desolvated at room temperature. They were originally two ethanol solvent molecules; one molecule of ethanol desolvated at room temperature, and the conformation of the remaining ethanol and t-butyl groups changed in conjunction with the removal of one ethanol molecule. Desolvation could hardly be detected by powder X-ray diffraction; however, it was detected using terahertz spectroscopy. Terahertz measurement of desolvation showed a high correlation with thermogravimetry data, suggesting that desolvation could be observed non-destructively using terahertz spectroscopy. We concluded that indinavir sulfate 1 ethanol deliquesced at 60% relative humidity, and it turned into an amorphous solid after drying.

AB Switching from batch to continuous pharmaceutical production offers several advantages, such as an increased productivity, a steady product quality, and decreased costs. This paper presents a control strategy for direct compaction on a continuous tablet production line consisting of two feeders, one blender, and a tablet press (TP). A data-driven, linear modeling approach is applied in order to develop a Smith predictor for active pharmaceutical ingredient concentration control and a model predictive controller responsible for the TP hopper level. Additionally, in case of severe concentration variations out-of-specification material can be discarded before it enters the TP. The effectiveness of the control concept is tested not only in simulations but also by implementing it on a real pilot plant.

AB The polymorphism of sulindac was investigated by Raman investigations, mainly in the low-wavenumber region in order to analyze the influence of the amorphization method on recrystallization and crystalline form stability. By devitrification of the quenched liquid, it was found that the undercooled liquid crystallizes into Form I, and a polymorphic transformation by cooling Form I toward Form IV, was clearly revealed. The low-wavenumber spectra of polymorphic forms are direct fingerprints of crystals, indicating a degree of disorder of Form IV intermediate between those of the ordered Form II (commercial form) and the relatively disordered Form I. This study has shown the enantiotropic relationship between Forms I and IV and that both the temperature of crystallization and the physical stability of Form I prepared is dependent on the technique used for preparing amorphous sulindac.

AB Intratumoral injection of biocompatible gels is increasingly used for the sustained delivery of drugs and vaccines to enhance the anti-cancer immune response. Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has become an attractive adjuvant thanks to its ability to boost the antitumor immune response by inducing proliferation, maturation and migration of the dendritic-cells (DCs) and the differentiation of lymphocytes. Killed Mycobacteria, such as Heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis (HKMT) have been used in several studies as TLR2 agonist to increase maturation of DCs. In this study, we designed a mucoadhesive thermosensitive formulation for the local delivery of GM-CSF and HKMT in order to enhance DCs activation and improve the local antitumor immune response. This formulation was selected based on its elastic and mucoadhesive properties obtained thanks to rheological studies. More importantly, intratumoral residence time of the labelled gel and protein were evidenced by means of MRI and non invasive in vivo optical imaging. Then, the efficacy of the combination of immunomodulators loaded thermogel was demonstated in vitro and in vivo. The selected thermogel exhibits rheological properties which confer a good elasticity and increased residence time of the immunostimulatory agents in the tumor, thus increasing the recruitment of DCs and T cytotoxic CD8(+) lymphocytes.

AB Effective inhaler therapy requires correct handling of the inhaler, including being able to prepare the inhaler for use. Motor function impairment and cognitive disabilities, may impose problems on patients with Parkinson's disease when they have to prepare medication, such as inhalers, for use. The aim of the present study was to examine whether Parkinson's patients are able to correctly prepare the Cyclops inhaler for use. At first, 12 patients, 6 in an off state and 6 in an on state, were asked to open 5 inhalers with ascending peel resistance of the cover foil. It was investigated up to which peel resistance they were able to successfully pull the foil from the inhaler. For the second part of the study, 48 participants, 24 on and 24 off, were asked to open 2 pouches and the 2 inhalers selected in part 1. For pouch 1, 70.8% of the patients in an on state and 58.3% in an off state were able to open the pouch correctly. For pouch 2, this was 79.2% and 75.0%, respectively. Both Cyclops inhalers were opened correctly by 95.8% of the participants in the on state and 91.7% of the participants in the off state.

AB Capsule filling is frequently accomplished via the dosator process. Controlling the main quality attributes, i.e., the fill weight and the fill weight variability, requires excellent process understanding. For the investigation of critical process parameters of low-dose capsule filling, DEM simulations were used. Two contact models (Hertz model and Luding model) were calibrated and validated to represent the lactose powder Lactohale 100. Both models gave good results, yet the Luding model resulted in better predictions. Since the dosator process is a volume-based approach, the dosator geometry is an important factor. We provide evidence that not only the volume, but also the proportions of the dosator affect the capsule fill weight. Slim nozzle chambers cause lower mass due to increased wall friction impact. The process is not volumetric, as a fill weight to volume correlation does not exist. Furthermore, the fill weight increases with higher powder beds and smaller gaps between the nozzle tip and the container bottom due to higher densification of the powder. Fill weight variations due to bed inhomogeneity were investigated by varying the bulk density of the initial powder bed.

AB Capping and lamination are classical industrial issues that can be challenging during the scale up of solid dosage forms. Previous publications showed that changing the unloading conditions (triaxial decompression, loaded ejection) made it possible to mitigate capping. In the present study, a systematic study of the effect of the unloading conditions on capping and lamination was performed using a compaction simulator.
   One model formulation for capping and one for lamination were studied. When symmetrical decompression was performed, as on a rotary press, capping (on both side of the tablet) and lamination were obtained. Asymmetrical unloading (fixed lower punch during unloading) made it possible to suppress lamination and to limit capping to the upper face of the tablet. This unloading condition is similar to the unloading on an eccentric press with a stationary lower punch. Finally, loaded ejection (small pressure on both sides until the end of ejection) made it possible to eliminate both capping and lamination.
   By changing the unloading condition, it is possible to obtain defect free tablets even for formulations with a high capping or lamination tendency. Moreover, experiments performed on an eccentric press showed results similar to those obtained for asymmetrical unloading on a compaction simulator. Anticipation of tablets defects during the development on eccentric presses might thus be complicated especially in the case of lamination.

AB The development of new antibacterial molecules is essential in view of the emergence of pathogenic strains resistant to multiple antibiotics. Among the infectious pathologies, pulmonary infections are particularly difficult to treat due to the complexity of lung anatomy and the presence of natural barriers such as mucus. At present, the aerosol delivery of antibacterial compounds is still poorly employed. Furthermore, the presence of bacteria in lungs negatively affects aerosolized Cystic Fibrosis gene therapy efficiency. A multi-functional formulation (antibacterial and transfection activities) could increase the therapeutic effect. This work reports the synthesis of new N-heterocyclic carbene silver complexes (Ag-NHC) featuring a lipid chain and the evaluation of their antibacterial potency, especially when delivered following aerosolization. When formulated alone in water, these Ag-NHC displayed remarkable antibacterial activities against some Staphyloccocus aureus strains and Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical strains. Moreover, combined with cationic lipid and DNA (ternary combination), they could be used to deliver therapeutic genes via aerosolization in infected lungs. Altogether, the data reported herein support n-alkyl chain Ag-NHC as a possible alternative to conventional antibiotics for treating respiratory infections and to combat the emergence of multi-resistant bacteria.

AB The performance of a series of inorganic salts as direct compression excipients was systematically evaluated. The physical-chemical and technological properties of the different salts were investigated in terms of crystalline/amorphous state, morphology, granulometry, apparent/tapped density, specific surface area, flowability, compressibility, dilution and distribution coefficients. To achieve a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the different salts, the data obtained by the various analyses were normalized, giving a score to each excipient for each evaluated property/parameter. Statistical elaboration (JMP software) of the full dataset provided a final ranking of the powders based on their effectiveness as direct compression excipients. The salt emerged as the best was used to prepare direct-compression tablets, using cefixime as model drug, by modifying the composition of marketed tablets. A significant improvement of the mechanical properties of the new tablets was observed, compared to the marketed ones, with a crushing strength increase of over 30%, without variations of the drug dissolution profile. Even though the resulted ranking cannot have an absolute value, being the behavior of the different excipients susceptible to the kind of drug and other formulation excipients, the proposed approach can provide a useful model for a systematic evaluation and comparison of potentially similar excipients.

AB Successful treatment of age-related macular diseases requires an effective controlled drug release system with less invasive route of administration in the eye to reduce the burden of frequent intravitreal injections for patients. In this study, we developed an episcleral implantable device for sustained release of ranibizumab, and evaluated its efficacy on suppression of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in rats. We tested both biodegradable and non-biodegradable sheet-type devices consisting of crosslinked gelatin/chitosan (Gel/CS) and photopolymerized poly(ethyleneglycol) dimethacrylate that incorporated collagen microparticles (PEGDM/COL). In vitro release studies of FITC-labeled albumin showed a constant release from PEGDM/COL sheets compared to Gel/CS sheets. The Gel/CS sheets gradually biodegraded in the sclera during the 24-week implantation; however, the PEGDM/COL sheets did not degrade. FITC-albumin was detected in the retina during 18 weeks implantation in the PEGDM/COL sheet-treated group, and was detected in the Gel/CS sheet-treated group during 6 weeks implantation. CNV was suppressed 18 weeks after application of ranibizumab-loaded PEGDM/COL sheets compared to a placebo PEGDM/COL sheet-treated group, and to the intravitreal ranibizumab-injected group. In conclusion, the PEGDM/COL sheet device suppressed CNV via a transscleral administration route for 18 weeks, indicating that prolonged sustained ranibizumab release could reduce the burden of repeated intravitreal injections.

AB This work proposes the application of artificial neural networks (ANN) to non-destructively predict the in vitro dissolution of pharmaceutical tablets from Process Analytical Technology (PAT) data. An extended release tablet formulation was studied, where the dissolution was influenced by the composition of the tablets and the tableting compression force. NIR and Raman spectra of the intact tablets were measured, and the dissolution of the tablets was modeled directly from the spectral data. Partial Least Square (PLS) regression and ANN models were developed for the different spectroscopic measurements individually as well as by combining them together. ANN provided up to 3% lower root mean square error for prediction (RMSEP) than the PLS models, due to its capability of modeling non-linearity between the process parameters and dissolution curves. The ANN model using reflection NIR spectra provided the most accurate predictions with 6.5 and 63 mean f(1) and f(2) values between the computed and measured dissolution curves, respectively. Furthermore, ANN served as a straightforward data fusion method without the need for additional preprocessing steps. The method could significantly advance data processing in the PAT environment, contribute to an enhanced real-time release testing procedure and hence the increased efficacy of dissolution testing.

AB Cosmetic hair removal procedures are everyday routines in our society. However, it is unclear if such routines lead to increased uptake of applied substances such as drugs or formulation compounds, potentially resulting in skin irritation or sensitization. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of common depilation and epilation methods on skin penetration of two surfactants and four model drugs of different physicochemical properties using the porcine ear model. It should be elucidated whether the substances' skin penetration behavior would be affected by hair removal procedures and if potential effects would be related to their polarity. Confocal Raman spectroscopy revealed no effect of hair removal on total penetration depths of SDS and sulfathiazole. Significantly higher relative penetrated amounts within 0-6 mu m of stratum corneum depth were found for SDS after dry shaving, depilatory cream and waxing and for sulfathiazole after all depilation methods and partly after epilation. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy revealed no effect of hair removal on the penetration depth of lecithin LPC80, but higher relative amounts at the skin surface after wet shaving and electric epilation. Diffusion cell experiments using a lecithin-based microemulsion as carrier system for fluconazole, fludrocortisone acetate and flufenamic acid showed higher cumulative amounts, higher drug fluxes and shorter lag times for the more lipophilic drugs for some of the methods, but only shorter lag times in some cases for fluconazole. In summary, the observed effects appeared to depend on drug polarity and experimental setup.

AB Microbiological quality of a pharmaceutical product is an essential requirement ensuring patient safety, thus effective sterilization/disinfection methods need to be found. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of different sterilization/disinfection methods on drug-loaded electrospun matrices and the impact of these treatments on the functionality related characteristics of these matrices. The sterilization efficacy of gamma-irradiation, ultraviolet-irradiation, in situ generated chlorine gas and low-pressure argon plasma treatment were evaluated on two different chloramphenicol-loaded electrospun matrices using pristine polycaprolactone (PCL) as a carrier polymer or PCL in combination with polyethylene oxide. Drug stability, solid state properties, morphology, mechanical properties, swelling, biodegradation and drug release kinetics were studied before and after the treatments. It was shown that all tested methods help to reduce bioburden and only plasma treated matrices were not sterile. At the same time drug degradation after the treatment can be considerable and depends not only on the susceptibility of the drug to degradation, but also on matrix properties (e.g. the nature of carrier polymers). Even though no morphological changes were observed, gamma sterilization increased the hardness and elasticity of PCL matrices as a result of increased crystallinity of the polymer. Plasma treatment was able to significantly enhance water absorption to otherwise hydrophobic PCL/CAM matrix and had tremendous impact on its drug release kinetics as the drug was instantly released from otherwise prolonged release formulation.

AB Glutathione (GSH) grafted onto nanoliposomes (GSH-liposomes) have the potential to enhance drug delivery into the brain. GSH is known to be an unstable tripeptide, however, despite widespread use to promote active transport its stability has been largely ignored to date. Therefore this study focuses on the optimisation of GSH conjugation with liposomes, supported with a validated HPLC assay for GSH. An isocratic stability-indicating HPLC assay of GSH was developed after derivatisation of GSH with 5,5'-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid and applied for efficient conjugation of GSH to DSPE-PEG2000-maleimide lipid, either in solution or in preformed liposomes (4% molar ratio) at pH 7.4. The conjugation rate was monitored by the HPLC assay to optimise the conjugation conditions, including GSH concentration, GSH:lipid ratio, reaction time, temperature and medium. The physiochemical properties of the resulting GSH-liposomes and their GSH densities were characterised. The HPLC method was linear in the range of 0.05-50 mu g/ml, highly sensitive (limit of quantification 50 ng/ml), and accurate (98-102% recoveries) with less than 4% intra-day and inter-day variability. Interestingly, enhanced GSH stability was observed at higher GSH concentrations >= 2 mg/ml and mass spectroscopy confirmed that GSH degradation occurred predominantly by oxidation. Both the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectra and HPLC analysis of GSH concentrations confirmed the formation of GSH-PEG-DSPE conjugate. Under the optimal conditions, complete conjugation was attained either by post-insertion or direct conjugation methods with the resulting GSH-liposomes attaining a GSH density of 4% with similar size (120 nm) and zeta potential (- 26.7 +/- 0.9 mV or - 29.8 +/- 1.5 mV). The study provides useful information on GSH stability for the optimisation of its conjugation in liposomal formulation.

AB The application of process analytical technologies (PAT) to monitor critical quality attributes (CQAs) provides an important approach to enhance process understanding and improve the reliability of pharmaceutical production processes. The present study focuses on the first PAT based feedback control system for a fluid bed granulation batch process. Real-time particle size measurement by in-line spatial filtering technique (SFT) using a modified time-based buffer system was applied to define a target particle size after spraying a specific amount of binder solution. After identifying an appropriate control variable, a suitable strategy for feedback control was established, followed by tuning of the control loop to obtain best performance of the integrated system. By adapting the final target particle size within a specified range good functionality of the system could be demonstrated. Investigations of the robustness further showed that the implemented system enables the production of a predefined target particle size also by varying process and formulation parameters. The effect of increasing spray rates and binder concentrations on the particle size could be compensated in a given range by feedback control ensuring a predefined product quality. The study provides an advanced approach for quality assurance of fluid bed granulation.

AB Modified-release oral dosage forms are commonly used in pharmaceutics to delay or sustain the release of drugs. Nowadays, they are only marketed as solid dosage forms such as capsules or tablets. Therefore, the development of a liquid oral dosage form with modified-release properties has been keenly awaited to increase the compliance of patients with a swallowing impairment, such as paediatric, older or critically ill patients. In this study, a new technology has been developed that consists of multi-layered particles suspended extemporaneously in a syrup, using omeprazole as a model drug. The coating procedure was optimized to obtain a yield of minimum 90% w/w and a mean diameter below 500 mu m. Eudragit (R) E100 and Eudragit (R) L100-55 were used to prevent the early release of omeprazole in the syrup and in the acidic environment of the stomach, respectively. These polymers allowed the stability of the coated particles to be ensured when dispersed in a liquid and the enteric release of the drug to be targeted. It was demonstrated that our new system presented similar release performances to existing marketed enteric dosage forms. It is able to protect omeprazole for 2 h in acidic medium at pH 1.2, while omeprazole was entirely released at pH 6.8 within 45 min. Once the final suspension is prepared extemporaneously, it presents sufficient stability to guarantee the administration of multiple doses filled into a syrup bottle and kept for a limited storage time at room temperature (e.g. up to 10 doses to be administered within 10 days).

AB Tableting failure due to binding is often caused by powder adhesion to the die wall. The present study was undertaken to develop a novel approach for analyzing the binding characteristics of various formulations and manufacturing methods, named "Binding Identification for Net Detriment" (BIND). Binding characteristics with raloxifene hydrochloride as a model preparation were evaluated by visual observation, ejection force and BIND. The surface replication method was initially employed to monitor powder adhesion to the die wall. Microscopic images with replicates were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. For the validation, BIND and measurement of the friction between a tablet and the die wall were performed. The qualitative data on BIND agreed with visual observations; however, there were some data discrepancies between the ejection force and visual observations. For the formulation without lubricant, BIND showed a 30.2% powder adhesion rate, while the formulation containing 1% lubricant exhibited a powder adhesion rate of 4.1%. Thus, BIND demonstrated that the use of the we tableting method reduced powder adhesion compared with the direct tableting method. BIND allowed qualitative and quantitative analysis of powder adhesion for both powder compression and tablet ejection. BIND is a promising tool for analyzing powder adhesion to the die wall.

AB The interest in approaches to deliver therapeutics to the lymphatic system has increased in recent years as the lymphatics have been discovered to play an important role in a range of disease states such as cancer metastases, inflammatory and metabolic disease, and acute and critical illness. Therapeutic delivery to lymph has the potential to enhance treatment of these conditions. Currently much of the existing data explores therapeutic delivery to the lymphatic vessels and nodes that drain peripheral tissues and the intestine. Relatively little focus has been given to understanding the anatomy, function and therapeutic delivery to the peritoneal lymphatics. Gaining a better understanding of peritoneal lymphatic structure and function would contribute to the understanding of disease processes involving these lymphatics and facilitate the development of delivery systems to target therapeutics to the peritoneal lymphatics. This review explores the basic anatomy and ultrastructure of the peritoneal lymphatics system, the lymphatic drainage pathways from the peritoneum, and therapeutic and delivery system characteristics (size, lipophilicity and surface properties) that favour lymph uptake and retention after intraperitoneal delivery. Finally, techniques that can be used to quantify uptake into peritoneal lymph are outlined, providing a platform for future studies.

AB Quality by design (QbD) principles were implemented to understand the product and process variables of so noprecipitation technique, for preparation of eprosartan mesylate (EM) nanosuspension. Quality risk management approach was utilized to identify and assess high-risk attributes affecting critical quality attributes (CQA's), prioritizing the number of experiments. The effect of critical material attributes (CMA's) and critical process parameters (CPP's) (soluplus concentration, drug concentration ultrasonication amplitude) on z-average particle size and PDI were investigated using a central composite face-centered design (CCF). Further, design space with criteria set of CMA's and CPP's was established to offer assurance of quality. The optimal formulation, identified using numerical optimization method, was further lyophilized and evaluated for redispersibility, solubility saturation, dissolution kinetic and in-vitro dissolution behavior. The EM nanoparticles were in an amorphous state as confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. The stability study conducted for a span of 6 months attests physical and chemical stability of EM dry nanosuspension in an amorphous state when stored at 4 degrees C. The enhanced solubility and in-vitro dissolution of EM nanosuspension may be attributed to the reduced particle size and alteration of the physical state from a crystalline to an amorphous state. Further, the optimized formulation was subjected to in-vitro and ex-vivo transport study using parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) and rat everted gut sac model respectively. The transport studies revealed successful permeation enhancement of EM nanoparticle when compared with EM API and physical mixture (PM). The absolute bioavailability of EM API was 7.1% and improved to 39.9% for EM nanosuspension, suggesting that nanoformulation had overcome solubility and permeability limited bioavailability which was observed with EM API.

AB The accurate prediction of the solubility enhancement offered by neat amorphous drugs and amorphous solid dispersions, over their crystalline (API) counterparts, has been discussed in several landmark works dating back at least two decades. Against this backdrop, an assessment of the current state-of-the-art for rigorously, yet simply (circumventing computational methods), determining the amorphous:crystalline solubility ratio based on thermo-analytical quantities is presented herein. Included in this work is a brief survey of the literature together with a discussion of the advantages and shortcomings of some of the most popular approaches, to-date. While the focus is on neat amorphous drugs, both before and after moisture sorption, the methodology presented is readily extended to more complex (e.g. ternary) systems that form a single, homogeneous phase. Six key questions are addressed in the context of how to most accurately determine the amorphous:crystalline solubility ratio: (1) How is the lattice energy of the crystalline phase assessed? (2) What is the role of heat capacity? (3) How does the pK(a) impact the solubility ratio prediction (for ionizable drugs)? (4) How does one incorporate the effects of moisture sorption on the amorphous phase? (5) How might one characterize (predict) the rate of drug recrystallization under various conditions (since the duration of the solubility enhancement is a kinetic phenomenon)? (6) What is the best approach for linking the (loss in) solubility enhancement to the T-g-lowering of the amorphous drug (by water) and vice-versa? In addressing these questions, this work aims to put forth a standardized methodology for determining the amorphous solubility enhancement with improved accuracy.

AB Printing technologies have been forecast to initiate a new era of personalised medicine in pharmaceuticals. To facilitate integration, a non-destructive and robust method of product authenticity is required. This study reports, for the first time, the interface between 3D printing and 2D inkjet printing technologies in order to fabricate a drug-loaded 3D printed tablet (printlet) with a unique track-and-trace measure in a single step process. In particular, quick response (QR) codes and data matrices were printed onto the surface of polymeric-based printlets for scanning using a smartphone device, and were designed to encode tailored information pertaining to the drug product, patient and prescriber. Moreover, a novel anti-counterfeit strategy was designed, which involved the deposition of a unique combination of material inks for detection using Raman spectroscopy. The inks were characterised for printability by measuring surface tension, viscosity and density, and each was successfully detected on the 3D printed tablet post-printing. Overall, this novel approach will enable an enhanced transparency and tracking of 3D printed medicines across the supply chain, leading to a safer treatment pathway for patients.

AB The possibility of newly developed alpha-glycosylated naringin (Naringin-G) as a solubilizing agent was investigated against pranlukast hemihydrate (PLH), a model drug with extremely low water solubility. The physical mixtures (PMs) of PLH/Naringin-G increased the solubility of PLH compared with PLH crystals and PMs with other additives, such as alpha-glycosylated rutin (Rutin-G) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Naringin-G did not decrease the surface tension, whereas SDS showed a surface-active property and critical micelle concentration. The apparent solubility of PLH increased in proportion to the concentration of Naringin-G, and similarly for SDS, indicating that constant amounts of Naringin-G molecules interacted with PLH molecules. There was no change in the Caco-2 cell viability following contact with a high concentration of Naringin-G solution (10% (w/v)). The oral absorption of PLH in a rat animal model was improved when administrated with Naringin-G. The value for the area under plasma concentration-time curve from PMs of PLH/Naringin-G was 2.2 times higher than that from PLH crystals alone. Together, these results suggested that newly synthesized Naringin-G would be a promising solubilizing agent as an alternative to surfactants.

AB Natural polysaccharides constitute promising material for nano-drug delivery systems (NDDS) due to their excellent biodegradability and biocompatibility. Previously, novel copolymer micelles (His-SA-BSP) were successfully engineered based on the functionalization of Bletilla striata polysaccharides (BSP) by histidine (His) and stearic acid (SA). In this work, the effectiveness of the designed micelles in selectively delivering Doxorubicin (Dox) to tumor cells is evaluated. The obtained results show satisfactory encapsulation efficiency, loading capacity, and drug compatibility of the copolymers. Surface charge conversion and micelle deterioration were observed at pH = 6.5 and pH = 5.0, respectively. In vitro Dox release assays indicate a rapid release of Dox from micelles under acidic conditions of tumor microenvironments. Furthermore, in vitro cytotoxicity and cellular uptake assays performed on Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) cells suggest that the proposed micelles are safe to use in biological systems, and that they can be easily and selectively accumulated at the tumor site due to pH sensitivity. Endocytosis inhibition and intracellular delivery assays reveal that BSP nanocarriers are mainly delivered to lysosomes by micropinocytosis. The acidic condition of lysosomes (pH = 5.0) then triggers the disintegration micelles, resulting in a fast release of Dox to the nuclei. Finally, in vivo biodistribution and antitumor assessments conducted on MCF-7-BALB/c tumor xenograft mice confirm the enhanced tumor accumulation and antitumor efficacies of the investigated Dox-loaded micelles. In conclusion, the pH-sensitive drug delivery systems designed previously are shown to yield improved accumulation of the drug at the tumor site, enhanced intracellular uptake, and efficient in vivo antitumor efficacy.

AB Powders containing one of four model proteins (myoglobin, bovine serum albumin, lysozyme, beta-lactoglobulin) were formulated with either sucrose, trehalose, or mannitol and dried using lyophilization or spray-drying. The powders were characterized using solid-state Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ssFTIR), solid-state fluorescence spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and solid-state hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (ssHDX-MS). ssFTIR and fluorescence spectroscopy identified minor structural differences among powders with different excipients and drying methods for some proteins. Using ssHDX-MS, differences in protein structure were observed among protein formulations containing sucrose or trehalose and mannitol, and/or with varying processing conditions, including proteins like beta-lactoglobulin, for which standard characterization techniques showed no differences. Proteins processed by spray-drying typically showed greater heterogeneity by ssHDX-MS than those lyophilized; these differences were not detected by ssFTIR or solid-state fluorescence spectroscopy. The ssHDX-MS metrics were better correlated with protein physical instability measured by size-exclusion chromatography in 90-day stability studies (40 degrees C, 33% RH) than with the results of DSC, ssFTIR, or fluorescence spectroscopy. Thus, ssHDX-MS detected subtle changes in conformation and/or matrix interactions for these proteins that were correlated with storage stability, suggesting that the method can be used to design robust solid-state pharmaceutical protein products more rapidly.

AB Oral treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with the immunomodulator, leflunomide (LEF), is associated with systemic side effects namely immunosuppression and hepatotoxicity. Herein, attempts to improve LEF therapeutic outcomes via nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) targeting inflamed rheumatic joints were executed. LEF-NLCs coated with either chondroitin sulphate (CHS) or chitosan (CS) were around 250 nm in size with negative or positive charge, respectively. Particle coating was evidenced by TEM and FTIR analysis. NLCs generally ensured sustained release profile up to 21 days, particularly extended in coated formulations. In vivo pharmacokinetic study of LEF suspension, uncoated NLCs, CHS- and CS-coated NLCs was carried out. Following oral administration in PA-induced rat model, joint diameter, paw inflammation, liver functions were measured, in addition to histological examination of liver, kidney and joints. Results revealed improved joint healing and reduced hepatotoxicity following treatment with nanoencapsulated LEF compared to LEF suspension, whereby CHS-NLCs ensued the highest C-max, AUC and lowest TNF-alpha level. The dual potential of CHS to achieve active targeting to CD44-receptor and hence maximize LEF concentration at the target site in addition to its synergistic effect in joint healing endow promises for a competent oral nanosystem for targeted drug delivery to the joints.

AB This study systematically demonstrated the antigenicity kinetics of HBV vaccine microneedles (MNs) during the fabrication, application and storage. To improve the stability of HBsAg in a microneedle patch, several selected saccharides were added to the MN formulations as stabilizers. According to the experimental data, no significant decrease of the bio-activity of HBsAg antigen was found during the microneedle fabrication process. And then immune effects of HBsAg added with different sugars were tested. Chitosan and trehalose loaded HBsAg MNs enhanced the antibody levels to approximately 1.5-fold and 2-fold of the plain HBsAg MNs respectively while sucrose and glucose were not obviously beneficial. During the short-term storage under 60 degrees C, the antigenicity of HBsAg MNs encapsulated with glucose and chitosan declined sharply in 24 h and hardly left after 7 days. As for the groups of HBsAg MNs added with sucrose and trehalose, approximately 90% of HBsAg initial antigenicity maintained, which could be attributed to the protective function of non-reductive disaccharides. As for the long-term storage experiments, the pharmacological activity of HBsAg antigen protected by sucrose and trehalose slightly reduced in 3 months except for the samples under 60 degrees C. In extreme condition, trehalose performed even better protection function than sucrose, of which the antigenicity of HBsAg in MNs left approximately 81% and 63% of its initial, respectively. These results confirmed that trehalose loaded HBsAg MNs enabled stable encapsulation and storage of HBsAg antigen and realized reasonable enhancement of immune effect in a relatively painless, safe, and convenient manner.

AB Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic, multifactorial metabolic disease whereby insulin deficiency or resistance results in hyperglycemia. A sustained high glucose environment results in inflammation and endothelial cell dysfunction. However, the underlying mechanisms are still not entirely clear. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are recognized as functional non-coding RNAs involved in diverse biological processes, including DM. Previous studies have found that hsa_circ_0068087 is increased in DM patients. In order to identify whether hsa_circ_0068087 plays a role in high glucose (HG)-induced inflammation and endothelial cell dysfunction Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cell (HUVECs), quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRTPCR), tube formation assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and bifluorescein reporter experiments were employed in this study. The results showed that the expression of hsacirc_0068087 was upregulated in HUVECs following increases in glucose. Knockdown of hsa_circ_0068087 suppressed HG-induced HUVEC dysfunction and inflammation by suppression of the TLR4/NF-kappa B/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway. Downregulation of miR-197 reversed hsa_circ_0068087 silence-induced HUVEC dysfunction and inflammation in the HG condition. It was found that TLR4 was the target of miR-197 and that overexpression of TLR4 ameliorated miR-197-induced HUVEC dysfunction and inhibited inflammation in the HG condition. Bifluorescein report experiments confirmed that miR-197 is a potential target of hsa_circ_0068087 and that TLR4 is a potential miR-197 target. Taken together, these results suggest that downregulation of hsa_circ_0068087 ameliorates TLR4/NF-kappa B/NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated inflammation and endothelial cell dysfunction in the high glucose condition by sponging miR-197.

AB Aureobasidium pullulans, a yeast-like fungus with strong environmental adaptability, remains a potential host for bio-production of different valuable metabolites. However, its potential application is limited by low-efficient genetic manipulation. In this study, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing via protoplast-based transformation system was developed. To test CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genomic mutagenesis, the orotidine 5-phosphate decarboxylase (umps) gene was used as a counter-selectable selection marker. By co-transforming of two plasmids harboring eas9 gene and a guide RNA targeting umps, respectively, the CRISPR/Cas9 system could significantly increase frequency of mutation in the targeting site of guide RNA. To further validate that CRISPR/Cas9 stimulated homologous recombination with donor DNA, a color reporter system of beta-glucuronidase (gus) gene was developed for calculating positive mutation rate. The results showed that positive mutation rate with CRISPR/Cas9 system was similar to 40% significantly higher than only with the donor DNA (similar to 4%). Furthermore, the different posttranscriptional RNA processing schemes were analyzed by compared the effects of flanking gRNA with self-cleaving ribozymes or tRNA. The result demonstrated that gRNA processed by self-cleaving ribozymes achieves higher positive mutant rate. This study provided foundation for a simple and powerful genome editing tool for A. pullulans. Moreover, a counter-selectable selection marker (umps) and a color reporter system (gus) were being developed as genetic parts for strain engineering.

AB Angiopoietin-like protein 6, which is encoded by ANGPTL6 gene (also known as angiopoietin growth factor, AGF), has been extensively characterized with regard to its proposed functions as angiogenesis and energy metabolism. The present results showed the occurrence of alternative splicing by intron retention (IR) event in the bovine ANGPTL6 gene (bANGPTL6). By means of RT-PCR, TA clone and sequencing, we have shown that the bANGPTL6 gene has a splice variant generated by the retention of its partial intron 3. The computational analysis of the bANGPTL6 genomic sequence showed that its intron 3 has a high percentage of GC (62.31%) and a length of 199 nt, characteristics that have been associated with an IR event. The IR event does not interfere with the coding region as the bANGPTL6 prepropeptide is entirely coded in the third exon. Additionally, both the intronless (namely, bANGPTL6 alpha) and intron-retaining (namely, bANGPTL6 beta) ANGPTL6 transcripts are constitutively co-expressed in the bovine liver. Further, the relative expression level of different variants in liver was tested by both semi-RT-PCR and RT-qPCR methods. The results suggested bANGPTL6 beta are significantly higher than bANGPTL6 alpha. Overall, our findings will be helpful for studies on the molecular mechanism of IR events and the functions of ANGPTL6 gene. Specially, bANGPTL6 beta gene probably contributes to a new target for treatment of obesity and obesity-related diseases.

AB Background: Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) a pleuripotent pro-inflammatory cytokine, is involved in retinal ganglion cells apoptosis in glaucoma. Thus present study aimed to analyze the association of TNF-alpha promoter region alterations (c.-238G > A (rs361525), c.-308G > A (rs1800629), c.-857C > T (rs1799724) and c.-863C > A (rs1800630)) with glaucoma in north Indian cohort.
   Methods: Present hospital based case control study involved 286 glaucoma patients (Primary Open Angle Glaucoma [POAG], Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma [PACG], Primary Congenital Glaucoma [PCG]) and 300 controls. TNF-a gene alteration (c.-238G > A (also referred as c.-418G > A; NM_000594.3)), c.-308G > A (c.- 488G > A; NM 000594.3), c.-857C > T (c.-1037C > T; NM_000594.3) and c.-863C > A (c.-1043C > A; NM 000594.3) harboring regions were PCR amplified and sequenced by Sanger sequencing. Allele frequency and genotype distribution in glaucoma cases and controls were compared using chi-square test and genetic association tested using different genetic models.
   Results: Statistically significant genotype and allelic association was observed between glaucoma cases and controls for c.-308G > A and c.-863C > A alterations (p = 0.001, p = 0.001; p = 0.001, p = 0.001 respectively). AA genotype of c.-308G > A conferred-7 fold increased risk towards glaucoma (OR = 6.82, 95% CI = 2.82-16.53, p = 0.001). c.-863C > A alteration under dominant, recessive and co-dominant genetic models conferred-2 fold increased risk for glaucoma. However, no association for c.-238G > A and c.-857C > T variants with glaucoma was observed. Further, three haplotypes (GGCA, GACC and GACA) (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.35-0.67, p = 0.001; OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.36-0.91, p = 0.019 and OR = 0.16, 95% Cl = 0.05-0.51, p = 0.002, respectively) conferred protective role towards glaucoma.
   Conclusions: Present study is the first to indicate significant association of c.-308G > A and c.-863C > A alterations with glaucoma in cases from north Indian cohort. Also it is the first study from India to analyze the association and interaction of four promoter region alterations (c.-238G > A, c.-308G > A, c.-857C > T and c. -863C > A) in TNF-alpha resulting in three protective haplotypes.

AB Cotton fiber initiation is the first step in fiber development, and it determines the yield. Here, genome-wide transcriptome profiling of Gossypium arboreum was performed to determine the molecular basis of cotton fiber initiation. A comparison of the transcriptomes of fiber-bearing ovules at -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3 d post-anthesis detected 12,049 differentially expressed genes that mainly participated in ribosome, carbon metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis pathways. Genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenase 1 and hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase, involving in fatty acid degradation and flavonoid biosynthesis, were enriched. Furthermore, 1049 differentially expressed transcription factors were identified. Among these, 17 were trihelix family transcription factors, which play important roles in plant development and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. In total, 52 full-length trihelix genes, named as GaGTs, were identified in G. arboreum and located in 12 of the 13 cotton chromosomes. Transcriptomic data and a quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that several GaGTs were significantly induced during fiber initiation in G. arborewn. Thus, the genome-wide comprehensive analysis of gene expression in G. arboreum fiber initiation will serve as a useful resource for unraveling the functions of specific genes. The phylogenetic relationships and expression analyses of the G. arboreum trihelix genes established a solid foundation for future comprehensive functional analyses of the GaGTs.

AB Previous studies report the upregulation of the secretory Rab27B small GTPase in human breast cancer, which could promote invasive growth and metastasis in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells. However, there is limited evidence for its role in ER-negative breast cancer, along with the signaling pathways. Consistent with previous studies, we here confirmed that Rab27B is upregulated in breast tumor tissue in comparison with normal breast tissue. In addition, in ER-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, when the levels of Rab27B expression were further elevated by transduction with recombinant lentivirus vector, migration and invasion assays demonstrated that cell migration and invasion was significantly stimulated. Moreover, Rab27B overexpression increased levels of beta-catenin, followed by upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Our findings reveal a key function for the Rab27B-mediated modulation of beta-catenin and VEGF in ER-negative breast cancer cell metastasis. Notably, the suppressed expression of Rab27B, beta-catenin and VEGF was found in calycosin-treated MDA-MB-231 cells, accompanied with decreased invasive and migratory potential of these cells. What's more, these inhibitory effects of calycosin were all attenuated by Rab27B overexpression. The results demonstrated that calycosin-induced inhibition of migration and invasion in ER-negative breast cancer cells may be associated with the inactivation of Rab27B-dependent signaling, and suggest that antagonism of this pathway by calycosin may offer alternative therapeutic strategy for the aggressive breast cancer.

AB Purpose: In order to identify the molecular characteristics and improve the efficacy of early diagnosis of mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer (mEOC), here, the transcriptome profiling by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) has been proposed as an effective method.
   Methods: The gene expression dataset GSE26193 was reanalyzed with a systematical approach, WGCNA. mEOC-related gene co-expression modules were detected and the functional enrichments of these modules were performed at GO and KEGG terms. Ten hub genes in the mEOC-related modules were validated using two independent datasets GSE44104 and GSE30274.
   Results: 11 co-expressed gene modules were identified by WGCNA based on 4917 genes and 99 epithelial ovarian cancer samples. The turquoise module was found to be significantly associated with the subtype of mEOC. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed genes in the turquoise module significantly enriched in metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 and steroid hormone biosynthesis. Ten hub genes (LIPH, BCAS1, FUT3, ZG16B, PTPRH, SLC4A4, MUC13, TFF1, HNF4G and TFF2) in the turquoise module were validated to be highly expressed in mEOC using two independent gene expression datasets GSE44104 and GSE30274.
   Conclusion: Our work proposed an applicable framework of molecular characteristics for patients with mEOC, which may help us to obtain a precise and comprehensive understanding on the molecular complexities of mEOC. The hub genes identified in our study, as potential specific biomarkers of mEOC, may be applied in the early diagnosis of mEOC in the future.

AB Background: Autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) is a highly heterogeneous genetic disease. PDZD7 is a new ARNSHL associated gene. Until now, nine PDZD7 biallelic mutation families with ARNSHL have been reported. Here we report a case of Chinese patient with ARNSHL linked to novel mutations in PDZD7 genes.
   Method: The pathogenic mutations were detected by whole exome sequencing for hereditary deafness-related genes of both the proband and his parents. We used kinship detection, mutational hazard prediction, genotype-phenotype correlation analysis and variation screening for potential pathogenic mutations. Re-sequencing was used to confirm the mutations by Sanger sequence. Real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to analyze the PDZD7 gene expression. Population-based screening for variation frequency, evolutionary conservation comparisons, pathogenicity evaluation, and protein structure prediction were conducted to assess the pathogenicity of the novel mutations of PDZD7 gene.
   Results: We determined three variants of the PDZD7 gene that contributed to the deafness of the patient (PDZD7 c.192G > A, p. Met64Ile; c.1648C > T p. GIn550* and c.2341_2352deICGCAGCCGCAGCp. Arg781_Ser 784del). Pathogenic analysis in accordance with the ACMG/AMP Standards and Guidelines identified two novel mutations as Likely Pathogenic. The expression level of PDZD7 gene in the patient was decreased compared to the normal control (P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Three mutations in PDZD7 gene linked to ARNSHL were identified in a Chinese pedigree. The findings expand not only our knowledge of genetic causes of ARNSHL, but also PDZD7 genes mutation spectrum of the disease. They will aid personalized genetic counseling, molecular diagnostics and clinical management of this condition.

AB Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the causative pathogen for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which lead to huge loss to porcine industry. RACK1 (receptor of activated protein C kinase 1) was first identified as a receptor for protein kinase C. Mounting evidence demonstrated that RACK1 played diverse roles in NF kappa KB activation and virus infections. We previously reported that siRNA knockdown of RACK1 inhibited PRRSV replication in Marc-145 cells, abrogated NF-kappa B activation induced by PRRSV infection and reduced the viral titer. Here we established a Marc-145 cell line which could stably overexpress RACK1 to consolidate our findings. Based on the data from RT-qPCR, western blot, immunofluorescence staining, cytopathic effects and viral titer analysis, we concluded that overexpression of RACK1 could enhance the replication of PRRSV in Marc-145 cells and promote the NF-kappa B activation via upregulating TRAF2 expression and its phosphorylation. Marc-145 cells overexpressing RACK1exhibited severe cytopathic effects post infection with PRRSV and elevated the viral titer. Taken together, RACK1 plays an essential role for PRRSV replication in Marc-145 cells and NF-kappa B activation. The results presented here shed more light on the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying PRRSV infection and its subsequent NF-kappa B activation. Therefore, we anticipate RACK1 as a promising target for PRRS control.

AB Tin side of commercial glasses with different strengthening treatments (i.e. tempered, heat strengthened, chemically strengthened) and without treatment (annealed soda-lime glass) have been compositional and surface characterized and then, compared with Gorilla Glass. Surface flaws from the strength treatment were observed in thermally treated samples by AFM. Raman studies show differences in the network connectivity (Q(2)/Q(1) ratio) because the different structures caused by the treatments. XPS was used to evaluate the oxidation state of the tin and compare the variations through the different treatments. Complementary, a study about the crack behaviour using a Vickers indenter was performed; different cracking pattern was obtained for float soda-lime glass in comparison with Gorilla Glass (R). In addition, the IQ(2):IQ(1) ratio as determined from Raman spectroscopy correlates with crack size from indentations.

AB In this work, a multicomponent GeO2-Sb2O3-BaO (BSG) glass is explored to assess its potential for 1.06 mu m fiber lasers. The glass-forming region of BSG system is predicted and determined experimentally based on a thermodynamic method. Benefitting from the incorporation of Sb2O3, this system possesses an exceptionally large glass-forming region, as well as high density and refractive index, wide infrared transmission range and low phonon energy. Furthermore, an efficient near -infrared emission at 1064 nm from Nd3+ has been realized in this oxide glass with relatively long measured lifetime (200.58 +/- 1.24 mu s) and large emission cross-section (3.015 +/- 0.090 x 10(-20) cm(2)), indicating that Nd3+ -doped BSG glass is a promising candidate for laser application in 1.06 mu m region.

AB This paper reports the variation in the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP) and the boson peak (BP) of lithium and cesium borate glasses xM(2)O-(1-x)B2O3 (M = Li and Cs, x = 0.08. 0.14, and 0,22) investigated by elastic and inelastic neutron scattering. The different content dependences between lithium and cesium borate glasses are discussed on the basis of the different modifications of the boron -oxide network structure by the small Li and large Cs ions. The static characteristic correlation lengths R-fsdp, were determined from the width of the FSDP of the static structure factor S(Q). The dynamic characteristic correlation lengths R-bp, were determined from the BP energy of the dynamic structure factor S(E). They are close in absolute value (about 2 nm). With the increase in the alkali metal contents, R-fsdp, increases, while R-bp, gradually decreases with the different rate in the lithium and cesium glasses. However, their ratio, R-fsdp/R-bp increases with the content of the metal in both the lithium and cesium glasses at the same rate. The decrease in the amplitude of elastic fluctuations with the increasing x due to the increase in fragility with the increasing x might restore the correlation between R-fsdp and R-bp, in the lithium borate glasses, and this tendency may be the same for the cesium borate glasses.

AB In this work, the selected samples of Al84Ni9Y7 alloy in the melt-spun state and after annealing were tested in 3.5% NaCl solution with the aim to determine their potential application as structural materials. The electrochemical measurements indicated that corrosion current density changes with the increase of annealing temperature. The sample in the melt-spun state presents the lowest corrosion current density (i(corr) = 0.3 mu A/cm(2)) and the highest polarization resistance (15.2 k Omega cm(2)) among others. The results were also confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The representative EIS spectra of ribbons after 1 h of immersion indicated that the diameter of the loops observed from Nyquist plots for sample annealed at 573 K is higher comparing to others. It confirmed the increase of corrosion resistance of selected samples after heat treatment. The mechanical properties were also changed in a function of annealing temperature. The tensile strength and hardness obtained for the samples are changed with the increase of the annealing temperature. The highest hardness (524 HV) was obtained for ribbon annealed at 623 K. However, the highest tensile strength (196 MPa) was obtained for the as-spun sample. The XPS measurements were used to determine the elemental composition of sample surface after corrosion. The corrosion surfaces were identified to Al2O3, NiO, Y2O3 and Al (OH)(3) compounds. The EDS and XPS results suggest that aluminum oxides and hydroxides were mainly formed as corrosion products on the surface of studied alloy.

AB The methods for estimation of the effective diffusion coefficients, Dee, governing crystallization of metallic glasses are briefly described and the values of pre-exponential factors, Do, and activation energies, Q, of Arrhenius-type temperature dependencies available in the literature for a number of Fe- and Al-based glasses are reported. It has been shown that the relation between logD(0)-Q characterizing effective diffusivity are well approximated by straight lines similarly to those found for the migration diffusion coefficients in crystalline and amorphous alloys. It has been found that the parameters A and B of the D-0 = Aexp(Q/B) correlations for effective diffusivity in Fe- and Al-based glasses essentially differ from those characterizing the migration diffusion in crystalline metals and are closer to the characteristics of impurity diffusivity in metallic glasses. It has been demonstrated that the values of A and B are dependent in the nature of the base element of alloy. The possible mechanism of the effective diffusion at the crystal/glass interfaces is discussed.

AB The bonding structure and composition of amorphous silicon suboxide (a-SiOx, 0.25 < x < 0.75) thin films deposited by gas-jet electron beam plasma chemical vapor deposition were studied by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS), and wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDS). Based on the dependence of the integrated absorption of the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching modes normalized to the silicon atomic density on the x values evaluated by RBS, the proportionality coefficient Asio of the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching modes was determined to be 2 x 10(19) cm(-2). Details of the Aso calculation, the dependence of the silicon atomic density on x, and the limits of integration were discussed. The significant overestimation of the x values obtained from the Si-O-Si stretching mode position in the IR spectra of the films in comparison with the actual values and the presence of a high-frequency shoulder centered at similar to 1140 cm(-1) in the IR spectra indicates the inhomogeneity of the structure of the films. At the same time, the parameters of the Si-O-Si asymmetric stretching band (position and full width at half maximum) indicate the absence of a strict phase separation in the structure of the synthesized films, which are thus described by the intermediate model.

AB Electro-optic glass for light modulators: Light modulators are important for processing of optical signals. Electro-optic modulators allow to control and influence the phase, frequency, amplitude, or polarization of the passing beam. Optical materials with a sufficiently high electro-optic coefficient are needed for construction of efficient and fast electro-optic modulators operating in the VIS and NIR regions. Heavy-metal oxide glasses based on the PbO-Bi2O3-Ga2O3 system represent a system with the highest non-linear optical susceptibility among oxide materials. Glass samples of PbO-Bi2O3-Ga2O3 system and those with addition of Ag2O and Sb2O3 were prepared by melt quenching. Thermal properties of the prepared materials were investigated using differential thermal analysis. Optical properties were studied using optical spectroscopy in the UV-VIS-IR region of the spectrum. The glasses are transparent from 550 nm up to 7.4 mu m. The maximum of the refractive index determined by M-line spectroscopy was found at 473 nm and is equal to 2.49. The electro-optic coefficient was calculated from the rotation angle of polarized light passing through the sample to which a high voltage of 5 to 30 kV was applied. The obtained values of the electro-optic coefficient allow for using these glasses to construct efficient intensity or phase modulators using the electro-optic effect.

AB Effect of Ce, as a surrogate for actinide elements, on structure, crystallization kinetics, glass transition kinetics and water resistance of the studied borosilicate glass has been investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Product Consistency Test (PCT). The results show that the addition of CeO2 induces an increase in the concentrations of non -bridging oxygens (NBOs) and a decrease of B-O-B bonds in [BOB] units, and promotes the conversion of [BO3] units into [BO4] units. Moreover, in the glass region, the glass transition activation energy (E5) and crystallization activation energy (E-g) of the borosilicate glass decrease with the content of CeO2 and surface crystallization is the main crystallization process for the CeO2 doped borosilicate glass while annealing. The formed glass waste form containing 15 wt% CeO2 shows good stability and water resistance. The normalize leaching rates of the main elements B and Si (LRB and LRSi) and actinide surrogate Ce (LRce) in the glass waste form keeps in the order of magnitude of 10(-3) g.m(-2).d(-1) and 10(-8) g.m(-2).d(-1) respectively in 28 leaching days. The obtained conclusions provide researchers with useful information for the disposal of high-level radioactive wastes which are rich in Ce or actinide elements using borosilicate glass as potential baseline glass.

AB Ni2+-doped fluorosilicate glass-ceramics with broadband emission have been prepared. The structural characterizations show that Rb2SiF6 nanocrystals separated from the glassy phase in the sample with a composition of RbF-ZnF2-SiO2:Ni2+. Moreover, the obtained Rb2SiF6 nanocrystals with the size of around 30 nm rely on stringent control of the heat-treatment temperatures. The experimental data reveal that Ni2+ selectively incorporates into the cubic Rb2SiF6 nanocrystals and locates at a typical 6F-coordinated octahedra. Meanwhile, a broadband emission in the important NIR range from 1200 to 2000 nm appears with the precipitation of Rb2SiF6 nanocrystals. The emission can be ascribed to the T-3(2g)(F-3) -> (3)A(2g)(F-3) transition of octahedral Ni2+ incorporated in the Rb2SiF6 crystalline phase. The Rb2SiF6:Ni2+ containing glass-ceramics provide an innovative choice for the development of photonic glasses with broadband emission.

AB The ion-implantation of silica is widely used in optoelectronics and neighboring areas. Si + ions serve for formation of clusters/nanocrystals in components of microelectronic devices; Ge+, P +, and B+ are used for controlling refraction index in lightguides. All enumerated ions interact chemically with oxygen atoms in SiO2, thus shading the stoichiometric distortions caused by direct impact interactions of particles with a host. In this research, the optically-active defects in the silica network were induced by embedding of chemically inert Ar + ions and thermal neutrons. A set of bands belonging to neutral oxygen vacancies (equivalent to Si-Si equivalent to), non-bridging oxygen hole centers (NBOHC) and some other point defects were detected in the photoluminescence spectra of implanted/irradiated samples. The intensity variation of the bands at the Ar + fluence increase was found to be caused by a competition between defect nucleation and their annealing or/and concentration quenching at high fluence. The ionization of atoms by charged particles resulted in the multivariant spectral manifestation of the defects of the same type due to their arrangement in differently distorted host localities. The diversification of defects produced by neutrons was lesser, because the neutron impact on the silica host was limited by the interactions with nuclei.

AB Before vitrified waste can be safely disposed of, a comprehensive understanding of the effects of temperature on wasteform aqueous durability must be acquired. In the experiments herein, a Magnox waste glass of 25 wt% simulant waste loading was leached in static batch experiments at 40, 70, 80 and 90 degrees C to investigate the Arrhenius dependence of dissolution. Results from ICP-OES/MS, EDX, SEM and XRD analyses are discussed in terms of the roles of the glass species within Magnox waste glasses.
   Here we show that changing the dissolution temperature changed the rate of hydrolysis relative to inter diffusion. At higher temperatures, the initial release of sodium deviated from Arrhenius-type behaviour and instead displayed an almost flat Arrhenius plot; demonstrating changes in temperature affect sodium differently to other glass species. Whilst the activation energies of the lithium and boron releases were in the range of a mixed reaction, the higher activation energy of sodium at lower temperatures combined with its non-Arrhenius behaviour suggested the dissolution processes of lithium and sodium differed. These observations were attributed to the preference of sodium to charge compensate the boron network.

AB Silicate glasses containing potassium oxide of molar percentages 12%, 16% and 20% each with 8% iron oxide have been prepared and examined by Raman, Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and Mossbauer spectroscopy. For the 12% and 16% of iron potassium silicate glasses, analysis of the Raman data indicated a maximum of Q(2) linkages of the silica tetrahedra while for the 20% iron potassium silicate sample, the Q(3) and Q(4) linkages were dominant. EXAFS data found the Fe ion to be in tetrahedral coordination with oxygen and a Fe O distance of similar to 1.85 angstrom. The isomeric shifts in the Mossbauer spectra found the Fe3+ to Fe2+ ratios to vary with potassium content from 2:1 for the 12% to 8:1 for the 20% potassium glass. Spectral areas showed iron ions to be tetrahedrally coordinated to oxygen with quadrupole splitting showing distortion of these units. From the distribution of Q(n) linkages it is found that at 16 mol% of the alkali, the lithium iron silicates have more open structures than the sodium and potassium iron silicate glasses. The more open structure of sodium silicate glass when iron is added could have important implications for its use as an electrolytic material.

AB In this research, the radiation shielding parameters for two glass systems with composition of 20MgO-(20-x)Al2O3-57SiO(2)-3B(2)O(3)-xCr(2)O(3) (x = 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mol%) and Na2O-Al2O3 SiO2 glasses were studied. For this purpose, a scintillation detector namely 3 x 3 inch NaI(Tl) has been designed for detection of photons through MCNPX simulation code. Thus, the mass attenuation coefficients (mu/rho) and some other gamma shielding quantities were calculated. The estimated MCNPX data of all the glasses were compared and approved with those of WinXCOM program. The gamma ray buildup factors for the two glass systems were also determined in a wide energy range of 0.02-15 MeV for penetration depths up to 15 mfp. The results revealed that the mass attenuation coefficients for the glass samples in the first glass system are higher than those in the glasses in the second system and thus the glasses coded as MASBC have more ability in reducing radiation than NAS glasses. Among the selected glasses, C4 has the largest values of mu(rho) and lowest half value layer, and therefore this glass sample has better shielding features than other samples. Besides, 3-1 glass sample has the lowest values; therefore this sample has the least ability to block and reduce the incoming gamma radiation. The results also showed that the effective atomic number (Z(eff)) of the glasses in the first composition increased with increasing the content of Cr2O3, and Zeff in the second glass system (i.e. NAS) increased with increasing the Al2O3 content. The values of mass removal cross section for neutron (Sigma(R)) vary between 0.09112 and 0.09163 and 0.08415-0.08710 for the first and second glass system respectively. The obtained results from the present investigation can be useful to understanding of influence of Cr2O3 and Al2O3 additive on nuclear radiation shielding properties of tellurite MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-B2O3 and Na2O-Al2O3-SiO2 glasses.

AB An aqueous solution route has been developed to prepare calcium sodium borate compositions of the formula xB(2)O(3).(100-x)(0.5CaO.0.45Na(2)O.0.05P(2)O(5)) (36.2 <= x <= 61.3 mol%). The effect of heat-treatment and melt quenching on the structure and physical properties was investigated using differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy, B-11 MAS NMR and density. Dried powders were heat treated at temperatures 400-800 degrees C for 3h. XRD revealed formation of crystalline Na2B4O7.5H(2)O, Ca-5(PO4)(3)OH, Na3B5O9H2O and CaB3O5(OH) in the samples treated up to 500 degrees C. Samples treated at higher temperature show the presence of CaNaB5O9, CaNa3B5O10 and CaNaPO4. Quenched solids obtained by melting powders are amorphous. It is deduced from FTIR spectra that CaO and Na2O modify the borate network forming BO4 and BO3 with non-bridging units, which depend on the molar ratio R = (Na2O + CaO)/B2O3 and temperature. The fraction N-4 of four coordinated boron atoms changes with R and can be predicted by treating the compositions as if they are mixtures of Na2O-B2O3 and CaO-B2O3 matrices. N-4 values have been used to calculate the fraction of all units in the glass structure. The results are confirmed by B-11 MAS NMR spectra that show the presence of symmetric and asymmetric trigonal BO3 groups and splitting line shape of B-[4]. The latter is assumed being related to different four coordinated boron environments. Density and molar volume obtained by using mixed matrices concept agree well with the experimental data.

DE Bulk metallic glass (BMG); Liquid-liquid phase transition (LLT);
   Metastable liquid miscibility gap (MLMG); Immiscibility loops
AB Based on the results of experiments performed at temperatures T greater than or similar to 613 K, a thermodynamic model was recently proposed to explain: (i) the origin of a metastable liquid miscibility gap (MLMG) in Pd-Ni-P, an alloy system with a negative heat of mixing. It originates from the superposition of two distinct liquid Gibbs free energy blades; and (ii) a liquid-liquid phase transition (LLT) just outside the MLMG. Since Gibbs free energy is a function of T, the MLMG was revisited in this work for its T dependence, but this time with T less than or similar to 613 K. It was found that the MLMG has the shape of a truncated right angle prism, instead of a right angle prism as suggested previously. It is similar to, but not the same as an immiscibility loop in a binary liquid mixture. The revised MLMG is in good agreement with the predictions of the thermodynamic model.

AB Borosilicate glass is used to vitrify high-level radioactive waste. Radiation effects on borosilicate glass have been studied extensively. Sodium borosilicate glass samples with compositions of 67.3% SiO2, 16.7% B2O3 and 16% Na2O in molar percent and vitreous silica were irradiated with multi-energy and single-energy Xe ions. After irradiation, hardness and modulus of both materials were accessed by nanoindentation. Volume change in two materials was evaluated using AFM. The hardness, modulus and volume change of both sodium borosilicate glass and vitreous silica varied fast and then saturated with the dose. The trends of both modulus and volume change with the dose for sodium borosilicate glass were respectively opposite to those for vitreous silica. The relative hardness variation of sodium borosilicate glass was - 35%, and that of vitreous silica was about - 10%. Difference in radiation effects between the sodium borosilicate glass and vitreous silica suggested that hardness decrease in sodium borosilicate glass irradiated with ion might be induced not only by transformation of silicate network but also by the transformation of boron network.

The glass -forming ability, thermal stability and corrosion behavior were examined with the aim to investigate the possibility of synthesizing nanoporous Pd(Ni) alloy structure which are exhibiting good electrochemical characteristics by the dealloying treatment of Zr-Al-Ni-Pd bulk metallic glasses in acid solution. After chemical treatments, the glassy rods exhibit open, three-dimensional, and separated nanopores structure. The size of nanopores (NP) is increased with increasing Zr content due to the enhanced dealloying kinetics.

AB We investigate the effect of a single heat treatment cycle on the potential energy states and mechanical properties of metallic glasses using molecular dynamics simulations. We consider the three-dimensional binary mixture, which was initially cooled with a computationally slow rate from the liquid state to the solid phase at a temperature well below the glass transition. It was found that a cycle of heating and cooling can relocate the glass to either rejuvenated or relaxed states, depending on the maximum temperature and the loading period. Thus, the lowest potential energy is attained after a cycle with the maximum temperature slightly below the glass transition temperature and the effective cooling rate slower than the initial annealing rate. In contrast, the degree of rejuvenation increases when the maximum temperature becomes greater than the glass transition temperature and the loading period is sufficiently small. It was further shown that the variation of the potential energy is inversely related to the dependence of the elastic modulus and the yield stress as functions of the maximum loading temperature. In addition, the heat treatment process causes subtle changes in the shape of the radial distribution function of small atoms. These results are important for optimization of thermal and mechanical processing of metallic glasses with predetermined properties.

AB n-Pentanol exhibits some advantageous fuel properties, such as a higher energy density, lubricity, viscosity, and low hygroscopicity, when compared to short-chain alcohols. It is miscible with pure diesel in large proportions and burns directly on diesel engines. Therefore, n-pentanol is considered to be a promising diesel fuel additive. However, the differences between the chemical and physical properties of n-pentanol and commercial diesel affect the spray, combustion, and emissions performance of commercial diesel engines. In this study, visualization and engine experimental test methods were used to study the spray, combustion, and emissions performance of diesel/n-pentanol mixtures. The results showed that the atomization characteristics of diesel/n-pentanol mixtures were better than those of diesel. As the engine load increased, the maximum in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate increased. The brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), nitrogen oxide (NOx), hydrocarbons (HC), and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions decreased, but soot emissions increased. Compared to diesel fuel, adding n-pentanol to pure diesel resulted in a decrease in soot emissions, while the BSFC, HC, and NOx emissions increased. Upon adding 50% n-pentanol to pure diesel (P50), the soot emissions decreased by up to 77.15% and the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) decreased by 1.86%. In summary, P50 could be burned directly on the diesel engine without any modifications, which can significantly reduce soot emissions; in this case, the BTE experienced only a slight decrease.

AB In this paper, the humidification dehumidification (HD) desalination system, driven by a mechanical vapor compression heat pump (MVCHP), is proposed. The direct contact dehumidifier, with packings filled, is applied to condense the humid air for water producing. On the basis of the thermodynamic laws, the energetic and entropic analysis, with the modified effectiveness to describe the heat and mass transfer characteristics of humidification, are first achieved to assess the desalination performance of the combined system. The influence laws from the terminal temperature difference (TTD) of the evaporator, the pressure ratio (PR) during compression and pinch temperature difference (PTD) of the condenser on the desalination performance are also explored and presented. The research results presented that the top thermodynamic performance of the MVCHP coupled HD desalination system arises as 71.56 kg h(-1) for the water production, 5.28 for the gained-output-ratio (GOR) and 1.73 kJ kg(-1)K(-1) for the specific entropy generation rate, while two fully coupled cases at 1.21 and 1.96 for the mass flow rate ratio will emerge. It is found that water production can be elevated effectively through increasing the pressure ratio, while the peak value of GOR keeps at the design conditions. Furthermore, the positive effects from lower values both for the TTDe and PTDcon on the performance of the MVCHP coupled HD desalination system are proved. After the economic analysis, it is calculated that the cost of fresh water is about 0.018 $ L-1 with a lifetime of 10 years. According to the performance comparison, the great potential of energy conservation for the MVCHP coupled HD desalination system are validated, although the water production will be reduced after the integration of the MVCHP.

AB The use of biomass gasification for partially or totally replacing methane in the integrated syngas and ammonia production plant is compared with the performance of the conventional route, typically based on steam methane reforming. However, by undertaking novel designs, additional or totally different demands are created. Consequently, the optimal integration approach between the new chemical plant and the alternative utility systems must be updated, so that the power and steam requirements remain satisfied. To this end, a systematic framework that allows selecting the most suitable utility systems whereas satisfying the minimum energy requirements (MER) with lower operating cost is adopted. The combined energy integration and exergy analyses proved to be relevant, especially regarding the integration of reactive components and the combined heat and power production (CHP) as well as the reduction of avoidable exergy losses. The exergy efficiencies of the natural gas and biomass-based ammonia production plants average 65.8% and 41.3%, respectively, and the overall emission balances vary from 0.5 to -2.3 t(CO2)/t(NH3), respectively. Despite the lower efficiency, higher operating revenues are achieved by totally replacing the costly natural gas input and avoiding the electricity import, favoring the consumption of a fraction of the syngas produced as fuel. Finally, it must be noticed that by defining an extended industrial framework, the inefficiencies at the upstream feedstock supply chains can be also accounted for, which entails a further reduction of 10-15% of the overall ammonia production efficiency. Accordingly, even by fully substituting the natural gas consumption with renewable energy resources, the sustainability of the overall system becomes rather an intricate function of the performance of the feedstock supply chains, the electricity mix enclosing the chemical system, the ammonia production plant and the main components thereof, as well as of the cost ratio of the resources consumed.

AB The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) is a perennial plant which is adapted to wide climatic conditions ranging from temperate to semiarid regions. Its tubers are alternative to potatoes and it can typically produce 18-28 tons of waste foliage from one hectare which can be exploited for bioenergy via pyrolysis. However, the pyrolytic behavior of its waste was never studied. The present study was focused to assess its potential via pyrolysis, kinetics, thermodynamics, and TG-FTIR-MS based study to produce energy and chemicals. The biomass was subjected to thermal degradation at five heating rates (10, 20, 30, 40, 80 degrees C/min) under an inert environment. The thermograms showed that the highest rate of thermal transformation was achieved at 270-430 degrees C. The data were subjected to kinetics and thermodynamics analyses using Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose (KAS), Flynn-Wall-Ozawa (FWO), Starink and Vyazovkin models. The activation energy (E-a) and pre-exponential factors remained consistent and ranged from 160 to 175 kJ/mol and 10(12)-10(14) s(-1) at conversion fractions ranging from alpha = 0.2 to alpha = 0.6. The kinetic parameters showed higher statistical confidence with R-2 >= 0.98 and good agreement among the data obtained through various models. The high heating value (HHV = 18.76 MJ/kg), change in enthalpy (similar to Delta H = 150-170 kJ/mol), and Gibbs free energy (Delta G = 158-168 kJ/mol) demonstrated the substantial bioenergy potential of this waste. Moreover, the pyrolytic gases were subjected to Thermogravimetric-Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy-Mass Spectrometry (TGFTIR-MS) analyses to identify the nature of products. The detected functional groups showed that the evolved gases contained aldehydes, phenols, carboxylic acids, esters, aromatic hydrocarbons and methane which indicated the substantial potential of this waste to produce energy and chemicals via pyrolysis causing no competition with the food/feed or land for food/feed.

AB Achieving the capacity to produce fermentable sugars from lignocelluloses via green and efficient approaches is of strategic significance to an environmentally sustainable society. In this work, a novel wet-mechanochemical pretreatment approach was proposed using small amount of dilute alkali-assisted ball milling and subsequently hydrothermal pretreatment at mild conditions to enhance the enzymatic saccharification efficiency of bagasse and pennisetum. Effects of pretreatment conditions, such as NaOH concentration, hydrothermal reaction temperature and time, on the reducing sugars production were systematically evaluated. Parameters were optimized by statistical analysis and response surface methodology. Results showed that the existence of small amount of dilute alkali during ball milling can greatly facilitate the subsequent saccharification of bagasse and pennisetum, which can reduce the alkali dosage in comparison with traditional biomass pretreatment approach. The highest reducing sugars yield of 40.75% could be obtained from bagasse after pretreated by final concentration of 0.4% alkali in hydrothermal pretreatment process at 100 degrees C for 40 min. 55.74% of reducing sugars could be obtained from pennisetum treated by final concentration of 0.4% alkali in hydrothermal pretreatment process at 80 degrees C for 60 min. Compared with pretreatment temperature and time, NaOH concentration had more impact on the reducing sugars yield. Chemical composition of lignocelluloses also showed great influences on their saccharification efficiency. This work provides feasible theoretical basis and method for the efficient utilization of lignocelluloses.

AB The use of renewable energy sources has becoming a necessity to generate electricity. Helical Savonius rotors have been preferred for small-scale hydropower generation. Numerous studies were carried out to improve the performance of the Helical Savonius rotor which has not been fully explored. In this paper, an experimental study was carried out to evaluate the performance of a Helical Savonius water rotor in an irrigation channel. In order to enhance the performance of the studied water rotor, a new deflector system design was proposed. Different configurations of the proposed deflector system were tested numerically using the commercial software ANSYS FLUENT 17.0. Without a deflector system, the maximum power coefficient is found to be equal to 0.125 at tip-speed ratio of 0.7. Using the optimal configuration of the new deflector system, the maximum power coefficient reaches 0.14. The utilization of this new design system is predicted to contribute towards a more efficient use of flows in rivers and channels for electricity production in rural areas.

AB Pumped storage hydropower system has now become a key support for integration of variable renewable energy. Along with the large-scale development of pumped storage plants all over the world, the importance of operation strategy is rapidly increasing with the fast-growing demand of flexibility. How to direct flexible operation and improve the stability of the system has become a key issue. This paper proposes a novel optimization framework to derive optimal operating policies for pumped storage hydropower system, which is divided into three coordinated stages: nonlinear modeling, strategy optimization and decision making. The real-time accurate equivalent circuit model is proposed in first stage, which can reconcile the conflict between simulation efficiency and accuracy, owing to the novel pump-turbine model and space-time discretization. The search corridor which consists of multiple constraints is defined to improve search efficiency. Reference vector guided evolutionary algorithm is performed to handle non-normalization objectives, multiple constraints and irregular Pareto fronts in second stage. Further, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is innovatively introduced to select compatible solution under extreme conditions. The originality of the framework is embodied in multiple trade-offs, i.e. trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in the nonlinear model, trade-off between convergence and diversity in the strategy optimization, and trade-off in conflicting objectives of the decision making. Compared with the on-site operation, the maximum water pressure of volute and the vacuum at draft tube can be improved by 5.59% and 9.6%, the rotational speed oscillation also decreases with this framework in load rejection. The proposed framework can specify the optimal policy to enhance the system reliability, which can also serve as the basis for smart operation in various conditions.

AB The high randomness, intermittency and uncontrollability of wind power make large-scale wind power generation present large challenges for integration into a power grid. In this paper, the principles of hydro-wind compensating operation are explored, aiming at improving the power quality of wind power and promoting the integration of wind power into the power grid. Based on the principles of hydro-wind compensating operation, the calculation method of the hydropower compensation capacity for wind power is derived. Then, an optimizing operation model of a hydro-thermal-wind hybrid power system based on the hydro-wind power compensating principle is proposed to minimize the carbon dioxide emissions and obtain optimal operation scheduling of the hybrid power system by taking advantage of hydro-wind compensation and the peak regulation capacity of hydropower. In this model, the baseload and nonbaseload output emission rates are adopted to estimate the carbon dioxide emissions of different power output processes and the emission reduction benefits. Moreover, three scenarios of the operation mode are proposed to demonstrate the applicability of the hydro-wind power compensating principle in practice. The Northwest Power Grid in China is selected as a case study to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model compared to historical operating data. The results indicate that the hydro-wind power compensating principle plays a crucial role in hydro-thermal-wind combined optimal operation. Additionally, the proposed model can improve the wind power generation and reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of the power grid. In particular, the carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced by approximately 1696*10(4) t each year in the Northwest Power Grid. This study provides an approach to schedule optimal operation plans for power grids with large-scale wind power and provides a valuable reference for the large-scale utilization of other kinds of renewable energy worldwide.

AB Solar chimney power plants are very large structures with the potential to generate significant amounts of electricity. Plant dimensions such as the collector diameter and chimney height and radius are important in determining system performance. The objective of this study is to identify the key parameters that drive performance. Performance was assessed in terms of power output and power output per cost. Using a detailed thermodynamic model, the plant power output was predicted for a wide range of design and operational parameters. It was found that the optimum pressure drop ratio depends on the collector and chimney radius, but not on chimney height, ambient temperature or insolation. The dimensions of the main components must be well matched to achieve best performance. Chimney radii of up to 200 m are essential to achieve maximum power generation up to 900 MW. Optimum power output exists for variation of the collector and chimney radius. However, increasing the chimney height always results in increased power generation. The physical phenomena underpinning high-performing configurations were highlighted. Power and efficiency increase with increased plant dimensions, but technological limits exist for the chimney height. A simple but robust cost model was introduced to identify optimum configurations in terms of power output per cost. Different relative costs between collector and chimney the optimum dimensions were selected. It was concluded that several smaller plants with collector radius about 3000 m are advantageous over one larger plant. Taller chimneys are economically beneficial until the specific chimney costs increase more than quadratically with height.

AB The major technological driver in energy and industrial sectors is the reduction of CO2 emissions. Huge technological effort is ongoing towards efficiency improvement of conversion systems, to reduce fossil fuel consumption. Capture and sequestration of CO2 on the flue gases represents an invaluable technology and among the only ones able to sustain the fossil fuel energy economy which cannot be replaced in short-term.
   In many cases, it produces significant energy penalties on the reference plant, being implemented through passive systems. In other cases, defined as active systems, it fulfils the goal of carbon capture without energy consumption or with energy production. In this regard, Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) concentrates CO2 at the anode exhaust, making easier the separation phase and increasing, also, electrical energy production.
   Therefore, a physically-based model of the MCFC was developed to assess the positive aspects related to the CO2 remover application, when it is integrated to a 250 WV coal-fired power plant. The removal capacity has been evaluated up to 95% and the calculated additional electricity produced can increase the overall efficiency of about 4% with respect to original value. The steam needed by the fuel cell can be extracted from the original steam power plant or it can be produced by a dedicated steam generator. These two options have been compared in terms of energetic and environmental performance. A cost analysis has been done in order to evaluate the best integration opportunity and to provide a comparison to a more conventional MEA (monoethanolamine) system.

AB The increasing worldwide energy demand is rising the interest on alternative power production technologies based on renewable and emission-free energy sources. In this regard, the closed-loop reverse electrodialysis heat engine is a promising technology with the potential to convert low-grade heat into electric power. The reverse electrodialysis technology has been under investigation in the last years to explore the real potentials for energy generation from natural and artificial solutions, and recent works have been addressing also the potential of its coupling with regeneration strategies, looking at medium and large energy supply purposes. In this work, for the first time, a comprehensive exergy analysis at component level is applied to a reverse electrodialysis heat engine with multi-effect distillation in order to determine the real capability of the waste heat to power conversion, identifying and quantifying the sources of exergy destruction. In particular, sensitivity analyses have been performed to assess the influence of the main operating conditions (i.e. solutions concentration and velocity) and design features (aspect ratio of the pile), characterizing the most advantageous scenarios and including the effect of new generations of membranes. Results show that the multi-effect distillation unit is the main source of exergy destruction. Also, using high-performing membranes, inlet solutions concentration and velocity of 4.5-0.01 mol/L and 0.2-0.36 cm/s, respectively, a global exergy efficiency of 24% is reached for the system, proving the high potential of this technology to sustainably convert waste heat into power.

AB In this study, the theoretical investigation of a novel heat pump assisted humidification-dehumidification desalination system has been carried out. The conventional dehumidifier of the humidification-dehumidification system was removed and the evaporator of the heat pump was utilized for direct dehumidification of air. Besides, the heat pump condenser was used as the saline water heater of the humidification-dehumidification cycle. First, the sizes of the components were calculated at design conditions for fixed input operational conditions namely the ambient air temperature, relative humidity, and inlet saline water temperature. However, the input operating conditions vary at off-design conditions resulting in changes in heat pump performance. Since the performance of a heat pump is a function of its refrigerant saturation temperatures, to examine the performance of the designed system at off-design conditions, the system performance balancing was carried out through the method of characteristics for a given set of fixed-size components. It was observed that the gained output ratio and hourly yield of the proposed system reach 2.476 and 0.91 kg/h, respectively. The economic analysis indicated that the cost per liter of the proposed system is 0.014 $/L.

AB Floating Photovoltaic systems have developed very fast in recent years. Compared to individual Floating Photovoltaic systems, further advantages, such as grid connectivity and energy storage, can be obtained when Floating Photovoltaic operates collaboratively with Pumped Storage Power Systems. This paper proposed an Integrated Floating Photovoltaic-Pumped Storage Power System and quantitatively assessed the potential of the integrated system in electricity generation and conservation of water and land resource. The study developed a coordinated operation model for the Integrated Floating Photovoltaic-Pumped Storage Power System, which employed a dual-objective optimization, namely to maximize the benefits of electricity generation and to minimize the energy imbalance at the same time. The dual-objective optimization was solved using the genetic algorithm method. Other benefits of the Integrated Floating Photovoltaic-Pumped Storage Power System, namely conservation of water and land resource, were also assessed. The proposed methodology was applied to a 2 GW Floating Photovoltaic farm and a 1 GW Pumped Storage Power System. Results indicated that the Integrated Floating Photovoltaic-Pumped Storage Power System has a great potential for gaining the benefits of electricity generation (9112.74 MWh in a typical sunny day averagely) and reducing energy imbalance (23.06 MW aggregately in one day). The coordinated operation provides the possibility to achieve a higher generation benefits without affecting the reliability of the grid, while the optimization method plays a key role of efficient coordination. In addition, the system would help to save 20.16 km(2) land and 19.06 million m(3) water a year due to the reduction in evaporation loss. The synthetic benefits greatly improve the economic and environmental feasibility of photovoltaic systems in reality.

AB Dual-fuel premixed charge compression ignition (DF-PCCI) combustion can achieve low nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions for wide ranges of engine operations. However, the deterioration in thermal efficiency, and hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions at low loads were recognized as the barriers for expanding the low-load operating range. In this study, the causes of the barriers were investigated and a mixture preparation strategy was suggested for overcoming the barriers in a natural gas (NG)-diesel DF-PCCI engine. Combustion and energy balance analysis was conducted to evaluate the strategy. Baseline DF-PCCI was determined by combinations of diesel start of injection (SOI) and NG substitution ratio (SR) at low loads from 0.3 to 0.6 MPa indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP). An increase in the homogeneity of a fuel-air mixture in the baseline DF-PCCI effectively reduced the NOx and PM emissions but increased the HC and CO emissions in each low-load operation. As the engine load was decreased, the formation of an overly-lean mixture intensified the effects of the mixture homogeneity. Therefore, the thermal efficiency, and HC and CO emissions deteriorated at 0.3 MPa IMEP. A mixture stratification strategy was established to increase the local equivalence ratio and reactivity of the fuel-air mixture. The strategy was realized by a retarded diesel SOI, a lower NG SR, and a higher exhaust gas recirculation rate. The strategy increased the degree of constant volume combustion by enhancing the combustion performance. The enhanced combustion reduced the combustion loss, and thus, improved the thermal efficiency. The HC and CO emissions also decreased mainly due to the improved combustion and the reduced mass flow rates of the NG.

AB Many studies have demonstrated the potential of large scale energy analyses when it comes to achieving highly energy-efficient districts. Much emphasis has been placed on giving insights into how to obtain accurate energy demand and solar potential estimations for whole regions, as a means of enhancing the integration of renewable energies, achieving higher self-sufficiencies or decreasing the energy costs. However, it is necessary to figure out whether it would be possible to enhance the economic savings and integration of renewable energies even more. This could be done by considering on a district scale the synergies between buildings, DSM strategies and electricity storage at building level.
   Using as a case study a microgrid in a district located in La Graciosa Island (Spain), this work proposes a novel strategy that encourages sharing surplus electricity between different prosumers, in order to maximize the overall cost savings and the utilization of renewable energy in the district. In this case, the prosumers are equipped with thermostatically controlled loads (heat pumps) and renewable generation with electricity storage (PV modules). In addition, a comparison between different preconditioning strategies is carried out, determining the optimal strategies during a whole year and reaching important conclusions. The influence of considering different time horizons for the optimization of these preconditioning strategies is also examined. Last of all, a sensitivity analysis regarding the main design parameters is performed.
   The results prove that, by promoting energy sharing, the proposed concept is capable of raising the self-consumption and self-sufficiency ratios of a district (reaching 42% and 64% respectively) as well as the cost savings. The results are very dependent on the considered feed-in-tariff: the lower it is, the more profitable it is to implement the proposed concept. The present study also shows the benefits that can be obtained from DSM approaches on a district scale: different precooling strategies, which may be implemented without additional investments, were chosen instead of the normal schedule on around 66% of the summer days. Altogether, the proposed approaches may effectively contribute to resource conservation at large scales.

AB The main aim of this paper is to investigate how far applying suitably conceived and designed credit scoring models can properly account for the incidence of default and help improve the decision-making process. Four statistical modelling techniques, namely, discriminant analysis, logistic regression, multi layer feed-forward neural network and probabilistic neural network are used in building credit scoring models for the Indian banking sector. Notably actual misclassification costs are analysed in preference to estimated misclassification costs. Our first-stage scoring models show that sophisticated credit scoring models, in particular probabilistic neural networks, can help to strengthen the decision-making processes by reducing default rates by over 14%. The second-stage of our analysis focuses upon the default cases and substantiates the significance of the timing of default. Moreover, our results reveal that State of residence, equated monthly instalment, net annual income, marital status and loan amount, are the most important predictive variables. The practical implications of this study are that our scoring models could help banks avoid high default rates, rising bad debts, shrinking cash flows and punitive cost-cutting measures.

AB According to no free lunch (NFL) theorem, a metaheuristic optimization method is superior to other meta heuristic optimization methods when it has focused on specific class of optimization problems. Thus, this paper focuses on developing artificial cooperative search (ACS) optimization algorithm to solve economic dispatch (ED) problems more precisely with less complexity than other metaheuristic optimization methods. ACS is a recently developed two population search algorithm based on coevolution process with high probability of finding optimal solution in complex and non-convex optimization problems. This merit is provided by balancing exploration of the problem's search space and exploitation of better results through use of two advanced evolutionary operators and only one control parameter. The constraint handling strategy of the proposed method for solving economic power load dispatch problems is to generate and work with feasible solutions along all the optimization iterations without any mismatch between the total amount of electric power generation and electricity demand plus network transmission loss. Unlike the penalty method, this strategy is unaffected by parameter setting of applied optimization method that complicates its applicability for solving economic power load dispatch problems. The feasibility of ACS for solving ED problem is tested on different lossy non-convex test systems of various sizes and complexities. The practical aspects such as satisfaction of power demand constraint, generation limits of generators and value-point loading effect are undertaken to solve ED problem in medium to relatively large-scale electric power systems. Obtained results confirm the ACS's capability in converging to a better solution highly robust within the reasonable computational time in all independent trials; all these as compared with other optimization algorithms reported in the literature for solving lossy non-convex ED problems. The results are analyzed statistically in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency. The statistical analyses reveal that ACS is a potential method to solve economic power load dispatch problems as it provides higher quality solution in comparison with other optimization algorithms.

AB Automated negotiation is a toolset to model human interactions during a negotiation process with the aim of improving the efficiency and quality of decision-making using advanced information analytics. During the negotiation, the participants share their viewpoints and concerns about the negotiation issues. However, in reality, they usually do not reveal the details of their preferences to one another. Therefore, modeling and learning opponents' behavior is a crucial component of automated negotiation. In this paper, we propose an estimation technique based on recursive Bayesian filtering to facilitate opponent modeling and-learning in the context of multi-participant, multi-issue negotiations. In the proposed technique, opponents' preference profiles are modeled using fuzzy functions, which are very close to the way humans evaluate alternatives. As the negotiation progresses, the agents can recursively learn the parameters of these models in real time. The only required information for this learning process includes the feedback and the arguments the participants may provide in support of their decisions. At each round, a probabilistic graphical model is also implemented that utilizes the learned preference limits of the participants to offer a new proposal with a high probability of satisfying the participants and reaching an agreement. The proposed methodology is examined in two different negotiation contexts: energy-system development and real estate service. The experiments show that the proposed opponent modeling/learning approach increases the efficiency of the negotiation up to 85% and facilitates reaching an agreement in fewer rounds of negotiation without requiring any prior understanding of the negotiation participants.

AB Extensive research has shown that collaboration has substantial impact on supply chains performance. However, most of previous research has focused on information sharing-based collaboration models that require considerable effort to be implemented, such as information exchange supply chain (IESC). This paper introduces a new efficient collaboration model (IS-OUT) for multi-echelon supply chains. The IS OUT model relies upon the ordering mechanism of the classical order-up-to policy (OUT). In traditional supply chains (TSC), although OUT replenishment orders include two pieces of information: demand forecast and inventory position balance, they are transferred to upstream echelons as single-quantity orders. In IS-OUT, the order information is transferred to the upstream echelons as two component parts of information to provide better coordination in supply chains. In this paper, the mathematical formulation of IS-OUT is presented, and simulation is adopted to compare the performance of TSC, IS-OUT, and IESC under special conditions and assumptions, considering various performance metrics. Although the results indicate that IESC model offers higher performance mostly than IS-OUT, IS-OUT outperforms or at least is comparable with IESC under a few conditions. Since IS-OUT model is easier to implement than IESC, IS-OUT provides a compromise between extent and information sharing requirements, and performance efficiency. The results should help a decision maker to select the model that optimizes its operating environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we advance the state of the art for solving the Permutation Flowshop Scheduling Problem with total flowtime minimization. For this purpose, we propose a Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) introducing on it a new feature called shaking. With the shaking, instead to full reset the population to escape from local optima, the shaking procedure perturbs all individuals from the elite set and resets the remaining population. We compare results for the standard and the shaking BRKGA with results from the Iterated Greedy Search, the Iterated Local Search, and a commercial mixed integer programming solver, in 120 traditional instances. For all algorithms, we use warm start solutions produced by the state-of-the-art Beam-Search procedure. Computational experiments show the efficiency of proposed BRKGA, in addition to identify lower and upper bounds, as well as some optimal values, among the solutions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the paper, "A two-stage adaptive fruit fly optimization algorithm for unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem with additional resource constraints" by Xiao-long Zheng and Ling Wang, published in a 2016 volume of Expert Systems With Applications, the authors present a mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) as a solution. This model is stated incorrectly, as it solves the problem of unrelated parallel machine scheduling without the additional resource constraint, which is not the given condition. A counterexample is provided in this note to demonstrate that the solution provided by the given MILP model not feasible for the considered problem. An adjustment on the MILP was developed to find an optimal solution for the problem addressed. The validation of the new MILP is verified. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While deep learning methods have demonstrated performance comparable to human readers in tasks such as computer-aided diagnosis, these models are difficult to interpret, do not incorporate prior domain knowledge, and are often considered as a "black-box." The lack of model interpretability hinders them from being fully understood by end users such as radiologists. In this paper, we present a novel interpretable deep hierarchical semantic convolutional neural network (HSCNN) to predict whether a given pulmonary nodule observed on a computed tomography (CT) scan is malignant. Our network provides two levels of output: 1) low-level semantic features; and 2) a high-level prediction of nodule malignancy. The low-level outputs reflect diagnostic features often reported by radiologists and serve to explain how the model interprets the images in an expert-interpretable manner. The information from these low-level outputs, along with the representations learned by the convolutional layers, are then combined and used to infer the high-level output. This unified architecture is trained by optimizing a global loss function including both low- and high-level tasks, thereby learning all the parameters within a joint framework. Our experimental results using the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) show that the proposed method not only produces interpretable lung cancer predictions but also achieves better results compared to using a 3D CNN alone.

TI A hierarchical clustering algorithm and an improvement of the single
   linkage criterion to deal with noise
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Agglomerative; Dissimilarity; Density
AB Hierarchical clustering is widely used in data mining. The single linkage criterion is powerful, as it allows for handling various shapes and densities, but it is sensitive to noise(1). Two improvements are proposed in this work to deal with noise. First, the single linkage criterion takes into account the local density to make sure the distance involves core points of each group. Second, the hierarchical algorithm forbids the merging of representative clusters, higher than a minimum size, once identified. The experiments include a sensitivity analysis to the parameters and a comparison of the available criteria using datasets known in the literature. The latter proved that local criteria yield better results than global ones. Then, the three single linkage criteria were compared in more challenging situations that highlighted the complementariness between the two levels of improvement: the criterion and the clustering algorithm.

AB Despite the increasing use of sensor technologies in border surveillance applications, there is a lack of systematic methodology and its implementation with the effective control system. The challenge arises due to information heterogeneity and uncertainty caused by the usage of different sensors. This paper extends the authors' previous dynamic-data-driven adaptive multi-level simulation (DDDAMS) framework to overcome this challenge using unmanned vehicles (UVs), sensors, and multi-level simulation. Specifically, the detection and classification algorithms are employed to process real-time data generated by fixed (e.g. geophone) and mobile (e.g. UV camera) sensors for the adequate monitoring. Also, physics-based simulation (PBS) is utilized to provide uncertainties for robust planning and control of UVs. The environmental effects as well as target's proactive behavior against the surveillance system are incorporated into the framework using utility-based decision-making model. Finally, we provide a detailed description regarding field demonstration, where autonomous control of UVs and real-time communications among all system components are attained through PBS.

ID NETWORKS
AB A number of algorithms now exist for using model-based prediction at the sensor node of a wireless sensor network (WSN) to enable a dramatic reduction in transmission rates, and thus save energy at the sensor node. These approaches, however, sometimes reduce the rate so substantially as to make the health state of the network opaque. One solution is to include a regular heartbeat transmission whose receipt or otherwise informs the sink about the health state of the node. However, given that a large period increases the probability that dead nodes go unnoticed at the sink, while a small period likely increases the energy cost of communication, what should be the period of the heartbeat transmission? In this paper, we examine the use of heartbeats in WSN design. We derive a general protocol for optimal and dynamic heartbeat transmission by minimising the Bayes risk, which is the expected cost of missing data from dead nodes plus the energy cost of heartbeat transmissions. Our proposed algorithm is dynamic in the sense that the heartbeat period is updated as time goes on and node failures become more probable. We validate our design experimentally using three real-world datasets, and show a 36% reduction in the total heartbeat operational cost over a heartbeat transmission with a fixed period; the results also highlight the superiority of our algorithm over arbitrarily chosen heartbeat periods in different WSN settings, thus promising significant cost savings in WSN applications.

AB The "curse of dimensionality" is one of the largest problems that influences the quality of the optimization process in most data mining, pattern recognition, and machine learning tasks. Using high dimensional datasets to train a classification model may reduce the generalization performance of the learned model. In addition, high dimensionality of the dataset results in high computational and memory costs. Feature selection is an important data preprocessing approach in many practical application domains that are relevant to expert and intelligent systems. Feature selection aims at selecting a subset of informative and relevant features from an original feature dataset. Therefore, using a feature selection approach to process the original data prior to the learning process is essential for enhancing the performance on the classification task. In this paper, hybrid particle swarm optimization with a spiral shaped mechanism (HPSO-SSM) is proposed for selecting the optimal feature subset for classification via a wrapper-based approach. In HPSO-SSM, we make three improvements: First, a logistic map sequence is used to enhance the diversity in the search process. Second, two new parameters are introduced into the original position update formula, which can effectively improve the position quality of the next generation. Finally, a spiral-shaped mechanism is adopted as a local search operator around the known optimal solution region. For a complete evaluation, the proposed HPSO-SSM method is compared with six state-of-the-art meta-heuristic optimization algorithms, ten well-known wrapper-based feature selection techniques, and six classic filter-based feature selection methods. Various assessment indicators are used to properly evaluate and compare the performances of these approaches on twenty classic benchmark classification datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. According to the experimental results and statistical tests, the developed methods effectively and efficiently improve the classification accuracy compared with other wrapper-based approaches and filter-based approaches. The results demonstrate the high performance of the HPSO-SSM method in searching the feasible feature space and selecting the most informative attributes for solving classification problems. Therefore, the HPSO-SSM method has broad application prospects as a new feature selection approach. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, Convolutional Network (CNN) has become an excellent solution to solve single image super resolution (SISR) problems. In this paper, a novel Deep Parallel Residual Network (DPRN) has been proposed which has been proved to be a fast and efficient algorithm to solve SISR problems using residual learning. It demonstrated significant advantages in accuracy and speed factors than other approaches with its deeper convolutional network structure, more accurate image reconstruction and real-time model execution. The proposed approach categorizes layers in branches and increases the number of layers to 35 with parallel local residual learning. Also, it adapts the Adam optimizer which can make the proposed system to achieve faster training speed and better image quality. Our experiments have been conducted using standard benchmark datasets such as Set5, Set14, BSDS100 and Urban100 and compared with current state-of-the-art approaches. Our results show that the proposed DPRN can provide higher super resolution quality with real time execution (27.18 fps average) when compare with different state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB This paper presents some approaches based on data mining techniques to solve the prediction task of Computational Intelligence and Learning (COIL) Challenge 2000. The prediction task of the contest is a direct mailing problem and the goal is to improve its response rate. The main issue in this competition is the incompatibility of the dataset in which the distribution of the classes of the target attribute is highly unbalanced. This in turn causes high error rate in identifying the minority class samples. Three different level methods including data-level, algorithm-level, and hybrid method are used to overcome this issue. The specificity, sensitivity, precision-recall, and ROC criteria are employed to compare the performance of the methods. Among the methods proposed in this paper, the best one performs much better than the winner of the competition. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Writer identification is an active area of research owing to its applications in a wide variety of fields, ranging from ancient document analysis to modern forensic document analysis. It deals with the writing style of documents and the learning of the discriminating features of different writers. In the domain of pattern recognition, the extraction of discriminative features of different writers has become very challenging. In order to address this concern, this work highlights a distribution descriptive curve (DDC-) and cellular automata (CA-) based model approach. The DDC utilizes the idea of the pixel distribution of handwritten text images to generate a unique curve as a feature vector. The generated feature vector is then fed to a support vector machine (SVM) as an input to identify the writer. Simultaneously, in a parallel mode, the initial handwritten text images are processed repeatedly with CA to generate another set of feature vectors. This new set of generated feature vectors are fed to a similarity-based classifier (SBC) as an input. The writer is predicted on the basis of the similarity of the features. The results from both of the approaches (DDC + SVM and CA + SBC) are merged to improve the performance of the model. This proposed model, DCWI, has good writer-identification capabilities compare with state-of-the-art techniques. Eventually, writer identification is accomplished using the ranking-based score scheme. The proposed model is evaluated on different datasets, e.g., IAM for English, IFN/ENIT for Arabic, and Kannada and Devanagari (Hindi) for the Indic script. The results show that the proposed model has better performance compared with existing state-of-the-art techniques. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fake news has become a problem of great impact in our information driven society because of the continuous and intense fakesters content distribution. Information quality in news feeds is under questionable veracity calling for automated tools to detect fake news articles. Due to many faces of fakesters, creating such tool is a challenging problem. In this work, we propose a model for fake news detection using content based features and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. To conclude in most accurate model we evaluate several feature sets proposed for deception detection and word embeddings as well. Moreover, we test the most popular ML classifiers and investigate the possible improvement reached under ensemble ML methods such as AdaBoost and Bagging. An extensive set of earlier data sources has been used for experimentation and evaluation of both feature sets and ML classifiers. Moreover, we introduce a new text corpus, the "UNBiased" (UNB) dataset, which integrates various news sources and fulfills several standards and rules to avoid biased results in classification task. Our experimental results show that the use of an enhanced linguistic feature set with word embeddings along with ensemble algorithms and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is capable to classify fake news with high accuracy.

AB Credit card fraud detection is an essential part of screening fraudulent transactions in advance of their authorization by card issuers. Although credit card frauds occur extremely infrequently, they result in huge losses as most fraudulent transactions have large values. An adequate detection of fraud allows investigators to take timely actions that can potentially prevent additional fraud or financial losses. In practice, however, investigators can only check a few alerts per day since the investigation process can be long and tedious. Thus, the primary goal of the fraud detection model is to return accurate alerts with fewer false alarms and missed frauds. Conventional fraud detection is mainly based on the hybrid ensemble of diverse machine learning models. Recently, several studies have compared deep learning and traditional machine learning models including ensemble. However, these studies used evaluation methods without considering that the real-world fraud detection system operated with the constraints: (i) the number of investigators who check the high-risk transactions from the data-driven scoring models are limited and (ii) the two types of misclassification, false alarms and missed frauds, have different costs. In this study, we conducted an in-depth comparison between the hybrid ensemble and deep learning method to determine whether or not to adopt the latter in our partner's system that currently operates with the hybrid ensemble model. To compare the two, we introduced the champion-challenger framework and the development process of the two models. After developing the two models, we evaluated them on large transaction data sets taken from our partner, a major card issuing company in South Korea. We used various practical evaluation metrics appropriate for this domain that has severe class and cost imbalances. Moreover, we deployed these models in a real-world fraud detection system to check the post-launch performance for one month. The challenger outperformed the champion on both in off-line and post-launch tests. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID VALIDITY INDEX; ALGORITHM; NUMBER; VALIDATION; DISTANCE
AB Clustering algorithms usually assume that the number K of clusters is known, although there is often no prior knowledge about the underlying set. Consequently, the significance of the defined groups needs to be validated. Cluster validity indexes are commonly used to perform the validation of clustering results. However, most of them are considered to be dependent on the number of data objects and often tend to ignore small and low-density groups. Furthermore, suboptimal clustering solutions are frequently selected when the clusters are in a certain degree of overlapping or low separation. Thus, we propose a new non-parametric internal validity index based on within-cluster mutual equidistant-scattering for crisp clustering. Eight different validity indexes were analysed to detect the number of clusters in a data set. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show the effectiveness and reliability of our approach to evaluate the hyperparameter K. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Singh and Yadav (2017) defined the product of unrestricted LR-type Intuitionistic Fuzzy Numbers (IFNs), and making use of the new product operation, the authors proposed a method to solve Fully Intuitionistic Fuzzy Linear Programming (FIFLP) problems. However, their method cannot be used to find the unique optimal value of FIFLP problems with inequality constraints. Recently, Perez-Cafiedo and Concepcion-Morales (2019) presented a method to find the unique optimal fuzzy value of Fully Fuzzy Linear Programming (FFLP) problems with equality and inequality constraints based on the optimisation of a lexicographic criterion for ranking LR fuzzy numbers. The authors suggested that their method could be extended to find the unique optimal intuitionistic fuzzy value of FIFLP problems with inequality constraints as well. In this paper, we analyse Singh and Yadav's method and modify it to find the unique optimal intuitionistic fuzzy value of FIFLP problems with equality and inequality constraints. Thus, a new method is obtained and is demonstrated by means of a fully intuitionistic fuzzy production planning problem. Results are compared with those obtained by using Singh and Yadav's method and show that the proposed method overcomes the shortcomings and limitations of their method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ID PORTFOLIO SELECTION
AB One of the main contributions of Black-Litterman asset allocation modeling is bringing out the idea of updating portfolios relying on the investor views. The incorporation of such views may inject subjectivity to the modeling phase. There is a recent literature on generating the views with financial forecasting methods, which employ either econometric or learning algorithms. In this research, we aim to propose a hybrid approach to the stream, in which GARCH modeling is used for predicting indicators for the stocks, followed by translating the indicator forecasts to return forecasts through Support Vector Regression. The obtained return forecasts are then fed into Black-Litterman modeling as investor views vector in order to generate portfolios with rolling data. The proposed model is tested in two markets: an emerging market (BIST-30 index of Istanbul Stock Exchange) and a developed market (Dow Jones Index of US Stock Market). In general, the results reveal better portfolio returns and Sharpe ratios than the index return for different holding periods, as well as better portfolio returns than randomly generated portfolios. We further show that the indicators can be accounted relying on the state or the market (non-trending or trending). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; KERNEL
AB Machine learning has become a pillar of today's expert and intelligent systems where a special attention has been drawn to unsupervised methods. Support vector data description is one of the most interesting methods proposed in this context that addresses two main challenges: the absence of ground truth labels and the presence of outliers in data. It is well known that the ultimate problem has a great impact on a system performance since it typically prevents and limits its generalization and hence its failure. Even though the strengths of the Support vector data description method, its application into multi class and large scale context, as computer vision systems, raises bottleneck issues due to its runtime complexity and mono-class context application. We propose, in this paper, an approach inspired from the movement behavior of particle swarm and relies on the use of core set paradigm to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks of Support vector data description method. Indeed, since the proposed method uses some parameters corresponding to kernel function and swarm's movement formulation, we present and study in this paper some strategies to ensure a dynamic adaptation of these parameters. The main qualities of the proposed method is that it provides a fast scheme for clustering a set of points without neither a prior knowledge on the number of naturally occurring cluster in the data nor an assumption on clusters shapes. A quantitative and comparative performance assessment is carried out over the Berkeley and BuffaloXiph datasets. The results witness the efficiency of the method in terms of both classification accuracy and computational performance. These quantitative assessments reinforce the significance as well as the importance of embedding the proposed method in other intelligent systems application areas. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ID REGRESSION
AB Predictive regression models aim to find the most accurate solution to a given problem, often without any constraints related to the model's predicted values. Such constraints have been used in prior research where they have been applied to a subpopulation within the training dataset which is of greater interest and importance. In this research we introduce a new setting of regression problems, in which each instance can be assigned a different constraint, defined based on the value of the target (predicted) attribute. The new use of constraints is taken into account and incorporated into the learning process, and is also considered when evaluating the induced model. We propose two algorithms which are modifications to the regression boosting method. There are two advantages of the proposed algorithms: they are not dependent on the base learner used during the learning process, and they can be adopted by any boosting technique. We implemented the algorithms by modifying the gradient boosting trees (GBT) model, and we also introduced two measures for evaluating the models that were trained to solve the constraint problems. We compared the proposed algorithms to three baseline algorithms using four real life datasets. Due to the algorithms' focus on satisfying the constraints, in most cases the results showed significant improvement in the constraint-related measures, with just a minimal effect on the general prediction error. The main impact of the proposed approach is in its ability to derive a model with a higher level of assurance for specific cases of interest (i.e., the constrained cases). This is extremely important and has great significance in various use cases and expert and intelligent systems, particularly critical systems, such as critical healthcare systems (e.g., when predicting blood pressure or blood sugar level), safety systems (e.g., when aiming to estimate the distance of cars or airplanes from other objects), or critical industrial systems (e.g., require to estimate their usability along time). In each of these cases, there is a subpopulation of all instances that is of greater interest to the expert or system, and the sensitivity of the model's error changes according to the real value of the predicted feature. For example, for a subpopulation of patients (e.g., patients under the age of eight, or patients known to be at risk), physicians often require a sensitive model that accurately predicts blood pressure values.

ID SCORING MODEL; PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; ACCURACY
AB For the sake of credit risk assessment, credit scoring has become a critical tool to discriminate "bad" applicants from "good" applicants for financial institutions. Accordingly, a wide range of supervised machine learning algorithms have been successfully applied to credit scoring: however, integration of unsupervised learning with supervised learning in this field has drawn little consideration. In this work, we propose a combination strategy of integrating unsupervised learning with supervised learning for credit risk assessment. The difference between our work and other previous work on unsupervised integration is that we apply unsupervised learning techniques at two different stages: the consensus stage and dataset clustering stage. Comparisons of model performance are performed based on three credit datasets in four groups: individual models, individual models+ consensus model, clustering+ individual models, clustering + individual models+ consensus model. As a result, integration at either the consensus stage or dataset clustering stage is effective on improving the performance of credit scoring models. Moreover, the combination of the two stages achieves the best performance, thereby confirming the superiority of the proposed integration of unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms, which boost our confidence that this strategy can be extended to many other credit datasets from financial institutions.

AB Extracting an effective representation to analyze affection in videos is an inherent challenge. To address this problem, we present a novel emotion recognition system that can intelligently analyze and automatically recognize video emotions. We observe that most of the emotions in a video are closely related to the roles, especially those of the protagonist, which motivates us to explore how to utilize the protagonist's information to help recognize video emotions. By analyzing the traits of the protagonists, we suggest a new solution to detect the protagonists to adapt not only to the whole video but also to a video clip. Moreover, a new keyframe selection strategy based on the protagonist is designed to select a set of representative frames from video clips. Furthermore, the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) features matrix, built from each keyframe, is fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the discriminative representations, which makes the CNN and local features complement each other. Considering that emotions are usually continuous, we introduce temporal information into the CNN by using optical flow images. Additionally, we extract some handcrafted visual and audio features as a supplement. Finally, all the features, including the features learned from the CNN and the handcrafted features, are fused and input into a support vector machine (SVM) and a support vector regression (SVR) for video emotion recognition. The proposed system is validated on a public dataset (LIRIS-ACCEDE) and a new dataset (PMSZU). The experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed system, which achieves better performance than the compared methods. Our designed system for recognizing video emotions could also facilitate the development of similar video expert systems, for applications such as video recommendations, video classification and video retrieval.

AB In this paper, we consider flow simulation in highly heterogeneous media that has many practical applications in industry. To enhance mass conservation, we write the elliptic problem in a mixed formulation and introduce a robust two-grid preconditioner to seek the solution. We first need to transform the indefinite saddle problem to a positive definite problem by preprocessing steps. The preconditioner consists of a local smoother and a coarse preconditioner. For the coarse preconditioner, we design an adaptive spectral coarse space motivated by the GMsFEM (Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method). We test our preconditioner for both Darcy flow and two phase flow and transport simulation in highly heterogeneous porous media. Numerical results show that the proposed preconditioner is highly robust and efficient. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB For a class of convection-diffusion equations with variable diffusivity, we construct third order accurate discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes on both one and two dimensional rectangular meshes. The DG method with an explicit time stepping can well be applied to nonlinear convection-diffusion equations. It is shown that under suitable time step restrictions, the scaling limiter proposed in Liu and Yu (2014) [23] when coupled with the present DG schemes preserves the solution bounds indicated by the initial data, i.e., the maximum principle, while maintaining uniform third order accuracy. These schemes can be extended to rectangular meshes in three dimension. The crucial for all model scenarios is that an effective test set can be identified to verify the desired bounds of numerical solutions. This is achieved mainly by taking advantage of the flexible form of the diffusive flux and the adaptable decomposition of weighted cell averages. Numerical results are presented to validate the numerical methods and demonstrate their effectiveness. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a parallel unified gas kinetic scheme (UGKS) is developed to simulate 3D multi-group neutron transport. The physical processes of neutron absorption, scattering, fission are included in the scheme. In order to design a multiscale method for capturing the physics in different regimes, the scheme is composed of solving coupled equations of microscopic neutron transport and macroscopic moment equation. As a result, a time accurate numerical fluxes for the neutron transport can be uniquely formulated and used in the construction of the multiscale method. The isotropic scattering neutron transport is studied in this paper, and it can be proved mathematically that this extended UGKS for multi-group neutron transport equation is an asymptotic preserving scheme. The scheme can be used effectively to capture the diffusion limit even with the mesh size being much larger than the neutron's transport characteristic scale, i.e., the so-called mean free path. Thus, the computation efficiency is greatly improved in comparison with the conventional single-scale scheme. In order to further speed up the computation, a parallelized UGKS has been developed for 3D neutron transport simulation as well. The newly developed scheme is verified through many numerical tests and shows high accuracy and strong robustness in the simulations under a large variation of transport condition.

AB We present a numerical method for simulating incompressible immiscible fluids, in two and three spatial dimensions. It is constructed as a modified pressure correction projection method on adaptive non-graded Oc/Quadtree Cartesian grids, using the level-set framework to capture the moving interface between the two fluids. The sharp treatment of the interface position, of the fluid parameter discontinuities, and of the interfacial jump conditions ensures convergence in the L8-norm. Using a novel construction for the pressure guess, we are able to alleviate the standard time step restriction incurred by capillary forces. The solver is validated numerically and employed to simulate the dynamics of physically relevant problems such as rising bubbles and viscous droplets in electric fields.

ID LINEAR-RESPONSE; ADJOINT; CONTINUATION; STABILITY; DYNAMICS; CLIMATE
AB The sensitivity of long-time averages of a hyperbolic chaotic system to parameter perturbations can be determined using the shadowing direction, the uniformly-boundedin-time solution of the sensitivity equations. Although its existence is formally guaranteed for certain systems, methods to determine it are hardly available. One practical approach is the Least-Squares Shadowing (LSS) algorithm (Wang (2014) [18]), whereby the shadowing direction is approximated by the solution of the sensitivity equations with the least square average norm. Here, we present an alternative, potentially simpler shadowing-based algorithm, termed periodic shadowing. The key idea is to obtain a bounded solution of the sensitivity equations by complementing it with periodic boundary conditions in time. We show that this is not only justifiable when the reference trajectory is itself periodic, but also possible and effective for chaotic trajectories. Our error analysis shows that periodic shadowing has the same convergence rates as LSS when the time span Tis increased: the sensitivity error first decays as 1/T and then, asymptotically as 1/root T. We demonstrate the approach on the Lorenz equations, and also show that, as T tends to infinity, periodic shadowing sensitivities converge to the same value obtained from long unstable periodic orbits (Lasagna (2018) [14]) for which there is no shadowing error. Finally, finite-difference approximations of the sensitivity are also examined, and we show that subtle non-hyperbolicity features of the Lorenz system introduce a small, yet systematic, bias.

We present two particle methods that leverage the structure of the inverse problem to enable efficient computation of the forward map, one for time evolution problems and one for Dirichlet boundary-value problems. The methods scale in a natural fashion to modern computational architectures, enabling substantial speedup for applications involving sparse observations and high-dimensional unknowns.

AB Efficient simulation of multiphysics problems is a challenging task. This is often due to the multiscale nature of the physics and nonlinear coupling between the different processes. One approach to this problem is to solve the entire multiphysics problem simultaneously in a fully coupled manner. However, due to the strong coupling and multiphysics interactions, it is difficult to design and analyze fully coupled solvers, which often entail the construction and solution of global fully coupled Jacobian systems. Another approach is the sequential-implicit method, whereby the full multiphysics problem is split into different subproblems. Each subproblem is constructed and solved separately; then the solutions of the subproblems are stitched together in a specific sequence. Isolation of each subproblem allows for the design of specialized solvers that tackle the complexity of the particular subproblem efficiently. The sequential-implicit approach offers wide flexibility and extensibility. However, these advantages are often offset by slow convergence rates when there is strong coupling between the subproblems. This slow convergence rate of the overall coupled system is directly linked to the use of a fixed-point outer-loop iteration in sequential-implicit methods. We present a Sequential Implicit Newton (SIN) approach, whereby the sequence of implicit subproblems is wrapped with an outer full Newton scheme. We demonstrate that the SIN formulation improves the overall convergence rate from linear to quadratic. The SIN method uses the same sequential-implicit scheme as the fixed-point method, but after each sequential iteration a Newton update is computed. Wrapping a Newton loop around the traditional sequential-implicit scheme leads to significant improvements in the convergence rate. The SIN method allows for the ability to split a multiphysics problem into individual subproblems while taking advantage of the quadratic convergence rate of the Newton method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SIN using two different multiphysics porous-media problems: flow-thermal in geothermal reservoir simulation and flow-mechanics in geomechanics reservoir simulation. Just as with the fixed-point iteration version of the sequential-implicit method, SIN benefits from careful design of the constraints used to stitch the sequence of the subproblems. Our numerical experiments show that the SIN approach improves the overall convergence rate for all the nonlinear multiphysics problems considered. For specific cases where there is strong nonlinear coupling between the subproblems, we see up to two orders of magnitude decrease in the number of sequential iterations when using SIN compared with the fixed-iteration scheme.

AB We present a set of new energy-stable open boundary conditions for tackling the backflow instability in simulations of outflow/open boundary problems for incompressible flows. These boundary conditions are developed through two steps: (i) devise a general form of boundary conditions that ensure the energy stability by re-formulating the boundary contribution into a quadratic form in terms of a symmetric matrix and computing an associated eigen problem; and (ii) require that, upon imposing the boundary conditions from the previous step, the scale of boundary dissipation should match a physical scale. These open boundary conditions can be re-cast into the form of a traction-type condition, and therefore they can be implemented numerically using the splitting-type algorithm from a previous work. The current boundary conditions can effectively overcome the backflow instability typically encountered at moderate and high Reynolds numbers. In general they give rise to a non-zero traction on the entire open boundary, unlike previous related methods which only take effect in the backflow regions of the boundary. Extensive numerical experiments in two and three dimensions are presented to test the effectiveness and performance of the presented methods, and simulation results are compared with the available experimental data to demonstrate their accuracy.

AB We propose a conservative prescription for perfect-conductor boundary conditions for a Darwin particle-in-cell (PIC) model on curvilinear meshes and arbitrarily shaped boundaries. The Darwin model is a subset of Maxwell's equation in which the electromagnetic mode (light wave) has been analytically removed. This renders the Darwin formulation elliptic, instead of hyperbolic. Historically, Darwin-PIC practitioners have had difficulty implementing a well-posed set of boundary conditions for realistic applications. In this study, we demonstrate the well-posedness and effectiveness of a simple boundary-condition prescription for perfect conductors of specified potential and of arbitrary shape in multiple dimensions, using a recently developed conservative, implicit Darwin-PIC algorithm. The boundary conditions conserve the electromagnetic energy, and preserve the Coulomb gauge of the vector potential, del.A = 0 exactly. We demonstrate that global energy is exactly conserved in curvilinear, simply-connected domains in the specific case of particles reflecting off perfect conductors. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB The numerical simulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations may suffer from instabilities due to the energy cascades activating small-scale dynamics even when high-frequency components are not in the initial conditions. The energy cascade is generally triggered by the non-linear convective term. However, the process can be triggered by particular geometries, such that the instabilities occur even with relatively low Reynolds numbers. While instabilities for high convective fields are well known and investigated (for instance, in the framework of the Variational Multiresolution formulation designed by T.J. Hughes and his collaborators), numerical stabilization of low-convection instabilities is less investigated. In this paper, we present a novel method where the backbone of classical stabilizations is merged with a localization of the potentially unstable regions by means of a deconvolution-filter indicator inspired by the Large Eddie Simulation (LES) turbulence modeling advocated by W. Layton and his collaborators. We introduce the method for steady incompressible Navier-Stokes problems, we motivate the design of the method in two different variants, the Streamline-diffusion one and the strongly consistent one. We provide some analysis of the approach and numerical results proving the improved performances in comparison with classical schemes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Magnetic gels are soft elastic materials consisting of magnetic particles embedded in a polymer network. Their shape and elasticity can be controlled by an external magnetic field, which allow for many applications, e.g., in engineering and biomedicine. Due to their inherent complexity, computer simulations are a commonly used tool to study these materials. A well-known bottleneck for the numerics is the demanding calculation of dipolar interactions. For periodic boundary conditions there exist established algorithms, however, at the expense of restricting the way in which the gels can deform in an external magnetic field. Moreover, the magnetic properties depend on the sample shape, ruling periodic boundary conditions where the gel has no boundary out entirely for some research questions. In this article we will employ the recently developed dipolar variant of the (PNFFT)-N-2 method for open boundary conditions with an N log N scaling in the number of particles, rather than the expensive N-2 scaling of a direct summation of pair forces. The dipolar (PNFFT)-N-2 method has been implemented within the ScaFaCoS library. The molecular dynamics software ESPResSo has been extended to make use of the library.
   After a short summary of the method, we will discuss its relevance for studying magnetic soft matter systems. A particular focus is put on developing a tuning strategy to reach the best performance of the method at a predefined accuracy, and lastly we will apply the method to a magnetic gel. Here, adapting the method to the change in shape of the gel during the course of a simulation is of particular importance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We consider the two-dimensional Saint-Venant system of shallow water equations with Coriolis forces. We focus on the case of a low Froude number, in which the system is stiff and conventional explicit numerical methods are extremely inefficient and often impractical. Our goal is to design an asymptotic preserving (AP) scheme, which is uniformly asymptotically consistent and stable for a broad range of (low) Froude numbers. The goal is achieved using the flux splitting proposed in [Haack et al., Commun. Comput. Phys., 12 (2012), pp. 955-980] in the context of isentropic Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. We split the flux into the stiff and nonstiff parts and then use an implicit-explicit approach: apply an explicit hyperbolic solver (we use the second-order central-upwind scheme) to the nonstiff part of the system while treating the stiff part of it implicitly. Moreover, the stiff part of the flux is linear and therefore we reduce the implicit stage of the proposed method to solving a Poisson-type elliptic equation, which is discretized using a standard second-order central difference scheme.
   We conduct a series of numerical experiments, which demonstrate that the developed AP scheme achieves the theoretical second-order rate of convergence and the time-step stability restriction is independent of the Froude number. This makes the proposed AP scheme an efficient and robust alternative to fully explicit numerical methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An accurate estimation of the physical properties of a free-falling raindrop such as its falling speed, shape, and oscillation amplitude are expected to improve the numerical models used for weather forecasting. Developing a numerical tool for Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of water droplets by the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) is one of the efficient ways to obtain empirical formulae for those physical properties. However, it is known that the IBM suffers from two instability problems in capillarity-dominant water droplet simulations. One is the spontaneous generation of unphysical kinetic energy, which is known as parasitic currents, and the other is spurious surface reconstruction. In this work, a new IBM is developed for stable water droplet simulations. A new force spreading scheme, which preserves the irrotational condition, is proposed to remove the spurious currents. Furthermore, B-spline fitting by least squares is adopted to relocate the Lagrangian markers for a smooth surface reconstruction. The conventional scheme and new scheme are implemented in a multigrid finite volume DNS solver and are subjected to standard test cases. It is confirmed that the unphysical parasitic currents are substantially reduced in the new scheme. The new scheme is applied to simulations of an axisymmetric free-falling droplet of low density ratio, a two-dimensional (2D) free-falling water droplet, and a rising bubble to demonstrate its robustness in a wide range of shape deformation and the capability of stable long-time-scale simulations for future application to raindrop simulations.

AB For applications, such as the plasma-coupled combustion system we consider, derivative-based sensitivity indices (DSI) are known to have several advantages over Sobol's total sensitivity indices, especially for small sample sizes. Several properties of derivative-based sensitivity measures are leveraged to develop a new and efficient numerical approach to estimate them. It is based on computing the DSI measures by effectively cost-free Monte Carlo sampling of an adaptively constructed orthogonal polynomial surrogate with uncertain input parameters that can have arbitrary probability distributions. The adaptivity reduces the number of necessary model evaluations, which is demonstrated both in a constructed example (the Moon function) and in two plasma-combustion systems with up to 55 uncertain parameters. Unimportant parameters are successfully identified and neglected with a low number of model evaluations, which makes it an attractive non-intrusive approach when adjoint solutions are unavailable to provide sensitivity information.

AB This paper presents a new class of solvers for the subsonic compressible Navier-Stokes equations in general two-and three-dimensional multi-domains. Building up on the recent single-domain ADI-based high-order Navier-Stokes solvers (Bruno and Cubillos (2016)[11]) this article presents multi-domain implicit-explicit methods of high-order of temporal accuracy. The proposed methodology incorporates: 1) Anovel linear-cost implicit solver based on use of high-order backward differentiation formulae (BDF) and an alternating direction implicit approach (ADI); 2) Afast explicit solver; 3) Nearly dispersionless spectral spatial discretizations; and 4) Adomain decomposition strategy that negotiates the interactions between the implicit and explicit domains. In particular, the implicit methodology is quasi-unconditionally stable (it does not suffer from CFL constraints for adequately resolved flows), and it can deliver orders of time accuracy between two and six in the presence of general boundary conditions. As demonstrated via a variety of numerical experiments in two and three dimensions, further, the proposed multi-domain parallel implicit-explicit implementations exhibit high-order convergence in space and time, robust stability properties, limited dispersion, and high parallel efficiency.

AB We present an implicit boundary particle method with background mesh adaptation. We use a Brinkman penalisation to represent the boundary of the domain and a remeshed particle method to simulate viscous flow with high Reynolds numbers. A penalty term is added to the Navier-Stokes equations to impose the boundary conditions. The boundary conditions are enforced to a specific precision with no need to modify the numerical method or change the grid, achieving an implicit approach for flow around complex boundaries/geometries simulation. The main idea of the Brinkman penalisation method is to model the solid obstacle as a porous medium. The governing equations for the compressible fluid and penalised Navier-Stokes for the porous medium are solved simultaneously, without need for interface conditions. The accuracy of the method is tested for a number of benchmark problems starting with simple cases such as a periodic laminar flow in a channel (Poiseuille flow), to more complex problems such as the lid-driven cavity with high Reynolds numbers, the reflection and propagation of a compressible shock wave, and finally swirling flow in a model two-stroke diesel engine. The remeshed particle-mesh method coupled with Brinkman penalisation provides a good quality simulation and the results are in agreement with analytical or reference solutions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This scheme has been implemented in a new code calledstella, which is capable of evolving electrostatic fluctuations with full kinetic electron effects and an arbitrary number of ion species in general magnetic geometry. We demonstrate the advantages of this mixed approach over a fully explicit treatment and provide linear and nonlinear benchmark comparisons for both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric magnetic equilibria.

AB Fractures should be simulated accurately given their significant effects on whole flow patterns in porous media. But such high-resolution simulations impose severe computational challenges to numerical methods in the applications. Therefore, the demand for accurate and efficient coarse-graining techniques is increasing. In this work, a near-linear complexity multiresolution operator decomposition method is proposed for solving and coarse graining flow problems in fractured porous media. We use the Discrete Fracture Model (DFM) to describe fractures, in which the fractures are explicitly represented as (n - 1)-dimensional elements. Using operator adapted wavelets, the solution space is decomposed into subspaces where DFM subsolutions can be computed by solving sparse and well-conditioned linear systems. By keeping only the coarse-scale part of the solution space, we furthermore obtain a reduced order model. We provide numerical experiments that investigate the accuracy of the reduced order model for different resolutions and different choices of medium. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Innovative hybrid composites of poly 4, 4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (PDDS)-zirconium dioxide (ZrO2)/cerium dioxide (CeO2) were prepared using a chemical polymerization process. The functional groups were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy profiles that revealed polymer establishment through N-H group stretching and in-plane bending vibrations about similar to 3454 and similar to 1623 cm(-1), respectively. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images were used to explore the morphology of nano-sized grains in the hybrid composites. The improved electrochemical capacitance behavior was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry curves. Charge-discharge curves were used to determine capacitance values of 229 and 288 F.g(-1) for PDDS-ZrO2 (15 wt%) and PDDS-CeO2 (15 wt%) nanocomposites, respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB We report a new V activated ZnO host co-doped with Yb3+ and Eu3+ downconversion (DC) phosphor to convert the UV photons to near Infra-red (NIR) photons. The absorption efficiency of the ZnO host with activator Yb3+ is found to get significantly enhanced with V doping. The NIR emission at 980 nm of Yb3+ is enhanced at an optimal concentration of 3 mol% V in ZnO host (ZV). Further, with an additional sensitizer Eu3+, enhanced NIR emission is observed at 980 nm for the corresponding excitation of Eu3+. The mechanisms for the energy transfer from the host (ZV) and sensitizer (Eu3+) to the activator (Yb3+) are discussed in detail. This enables ZV: Eu3+, Yb3+ as an efficient DC phosphor which could enhance the spectral response of Si-solar cells in the UV range. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Enhancing electrical strength of acrylate polymer by using fluorinated
   monomer as surface modifier

DT Article
DE Polymer insulation; Fluorination; Photopolymerization; Electrical
   properties; Surfaces; Segregation
AB A novel method using ultraviolet (UV) cured fluoralkene to realize surface fluorination of acrylate polymer is proposed to enhance its insulation performance. Doping small amount of dofluoroheptyl methacrylate C11H8F12O2 (DFHMA) in UV acrylate resin formulation as modifier can assemble a fluorinated monomolecular layer on the surface whenas bringing little change to its morphology. The influences of the modifier on molecular structure, surface free energy, elemental composition and electric properties of acrylate polymer are investigated by attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR), water contact angle, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrical performance characterizations, respectively. Experimental results indicate that DFHMA is segregated to the surface of acrylate polymer, leading to an increase of its surface hydrophobicity. Surface flashover tests reveal that fluorinated samples have a higher degradation or tracking resistance in comparison with virgin samples. In addition, strong CAF bonds also can enhance bulk breakdown characteristics by increasing charge injection barrier. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The lead-free (1-x)(0.8Na(0.5)Bi(0.5)TiO(3)-0.2 K0.5Bi0.5TiO3)-xBi(Mg2/3Nb1/3)O-3 ceramics were prepared using pressureless solid-state sintering for compositions x <= 0.4. At 120 degrees C, the recoverable energy storage density (W-rec) of x = 0.2 sample reached as high as 0.80 J/cm(3) under the electric field of 90 kV/cm, significantly better than the other literature reported Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 based samples. The fine-grained sample maintained high insulation resistivity (10(11) Omega.m order) from 25 degrees C to 200 degrees C, which contributes to large breakdown electric field at high temperatures and leads to the excellent energy storage characteristics. This work could broaden the applications of Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 based materials in building high-temperature multi-layer energy storage capacitor. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Dislocation; GaN; Decomposition; Defects; Surfaces
AB The thermal annealing process is widely used in the growth and subsequent process of GaN, but the mechanism of thermal decomposition is unclear. A series of GaN templates were annealed at 1040 degrees C for different time. It is found that dislocations play an important role in both the origin of thermal decomposition and the evolution of surface morphology. The thermal decomposition rate of GaN without dislocations is much lower than that with dislocations. Thermal annealing could be used as a new method to assess the dislocation density of GaN. This study provides the underlying insights needed to study the thermostability of intrinsic GaN. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Highly efficient CdTe absorber-based solar cells often require Cu-doping for lower resistivity and a suitable ohmic contact, but Cu migration degrades the performance and creates instability of device. Therefore to address these problems, there is a need to optimize CdTe single layer itself with another suitable doping element, so in this report, we have optimized the physical properties of Bi-doped CdTe thin films where the films were air annealed at the different temperatures. Structural analysis revealed the polycrystalline nature with (1 1 1) preferred reflection and maximum grain growth for films annealed at 300 degrees C as well as high optical absorbance and maximum conductivity are also observed for these films. The investigated findings show that films annealed at 300 degrees C have favorable properties and may be utilized in the fabrication of highly efficient solar cells. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Intermetallic phases in Au-Cu nanoparticles has been synthesized chemically in liquid phase. The heat-treatment of these nanoparticles at 180 degrees C for 1 h in solution phase led to the formation of Au-Cu alloy nanoparticles with nearly spherical shapes and monodispersed size of similar to 10 nm. Subsequent heat-treatment at 300 degrees C for 30 min of these Au-Cu alloy nanoparticles not only revealed structural transformation to intermetallic phases (tetragonal AuCu (tP4) and cubic Cu3Au (cP4)) but also shape change occurs from spherical to rods having average aspect ratio similar to 3.0. The structural determination at the particle has been carried out through nano-beam electron diffraction coupled with simulation of electron diffraction patterns and high resolution phase contrast images. These Au-Cu intermetallic nanoparticles exhibit an excellent surface enhanced Raman spectroscopic activity with methylene blue compared to that of Au-Cu alloy nanoparticles. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Herein, we correlate the chemical structure of the electrolyte with the performance of inverted Schottky quantum dot (QD) solar cells (SCs) having a structure of FTO/electrolyte/p-type PbS QDs/MoOx/Au-Ag. QDSCs of polyethyleneimine (PEI) or poly[(9,9-bis(3'-(N, N-dimethylamino) propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-1,4-phenylene] (PFN) were fabricated for comparison. The open-circuit voltage (V-OC) of QDSCs scaled with the workfunction of electrolyte-modified fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO). Conjugated PFN electrolyte resulted in lower V-OC but it boosted the current density (J(SC)) of QDSCs by lowering the interfacial potential barrier at FTO-PbS QDs contact. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Highly-ordered tin-doped CdS comb-like microstructure was synthesized by a common CVD route. SEM image shows the branches with the uniform diameter are distributed at one side of the CdS trunk. EDS and XPS results confirm the main elemental composition of the CdS comb is Cd, S and Sn. The crystal structure is characterized by TEM. High resolution TEM image shows a typical wurtzite structure and the corresponding SAED pattern demonstrates the trunk grows along [-1101] direction, which has no polarity. Moreover, the micro-sliding rheostat has been successfully fabricated by connecting the trunk with four individual branches. The electrical characterization reveals that the resistance can be tuned from 57.79 to 49.65 k Omega in dark and changed from 44.35 to 38.52 k Omega under the illumination of white light. This work shows that the CdS comb-like microstructure has the great potential to be used as a micro-zone variable resistor device for the construction of integrated optoelectronic devices.

AB Li-rich layered transition metal oxides show high reversible capacity in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, as represented by the Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2. However, it suffers from severe problems in practical applications such as voltage fading, poor cycle life and poor rate performance. Here, we reported a Li-rich layered oxide Li1.233Mo0.467Fe0.3O2 showing high reversible specific capacity of 262.9 mA h/g at the initial cycle and then up to 305.4 mA h/g after several cycles. The material shows decent capacity retention that after 25 cycles it still sustained a value of 257.8 mAh/g at the charge/discharge voltage range of 1.0-4.3 V. It is noticed that the capacity increase at 2.5 V platform is attributed to structural rearrangement at lower potential. The present work suggests choosing appropriate constituent stabilizing structures in Li-rich layered oxides should be an efficient strategy for designing advanced cathode materials.

The non-contact model offers a good cell separation, but the long cell-cell distance limited the cell interactions. This study proposed a conceptual 3D coculture model based on collagen hydrogel microspheres (CHMs) with removable superparamagnetic alginate coating (Alg-Mag-CHMs) to offer a minimal distance and easy separation. The Alg-Mag-CHMs fabrication was achieved using layer-by-layer encapsulation. The thickness could be tailored by applying different numbers of coating layers. Alg-Mag-CHMs had a denser alginate hydrogel shell, which prevented the risk of cell leakage. After mixture, Alg-Mag-CHMs could be rapidly separated in magnet field and the coating could be easily washed off. This study presented proof of concept data of a non-contact 3D coculture model that offered many useful features. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this report, we prepared nitrogen-doped microporous carbon (N-MPC) via carbonization of a precursor triazine-based porous organic polymer (POP). The as-prepared POP and N-MPC were characterized by various analytical techniques. The N-MPC presents many advantages for supercapacitor applications, including higher surface area (801 m(2) g(-1)), microporous structure, and uniform pore size. The supercapacitor performance of N-MPC was evaluated in a 6 M KOH electrolyte and exhibited a high specific capacitance of 505 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1). The electrode showed excellent cycling stability with 89% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at a current density of 3.0 A g(-1). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The WC mean grain size, grains size distribution, binder phase composition and properties of four batches of WC-based cemented carbides with different Co:Re ratios varying from 0:100 to 60:40 were examined. The WC mean grain size significantly decreases, hardness and coercivity increases and magnetic moment decreases when increasing the Re:Co ratio in the binder of WC-Co-Re cemented carbides. The uniformity of the carbide microstructure is slightly reduced by increasing the amount of Re added to the Co-based binder phase. The content of hcp Co in the binder phase steadily increases when increasing the Re content in the binder from 5 to 60 wt% and the Co-Re binder containing 60 wt% Re comprises almost exclusively hcp Co.

AB In order to improve the flame retardancy of methyl ethyl silicone rubber (VMQ), the synergistic effect of an intumescent flame retardant (IFR) system consisting of hexophenoxy cyclotriphosphazene (HPCP) and ammonium polyphosphate (APP) was investigated. The results showed that with a total loading of 30 wt% IFR, the flame-retarded VMQ composite got the highest limiting oxygen index (LOI) of 30.6% and UL-94V-0 rating at mass ratio of HPCP and APP of 1:1. Meanwhile, the flame retardancy index (14.88) indicated that the synergistic effect of the system was excellent. Then digital photographs, SEM images and FTIR spectra of residue chars obtained from the CC test demonstrated the flame retarding mechanism in the condensed phase. In addition, mechanisms were also discussed based on TG and Py-GCMS results. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We presented a facile method to prepare silver nanowire (Ag NW) transparent conductive film (TCF) for heaters. Hydroxylpropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) was used for achieving the excellent dispersity of Ag NWs owing to the hydrogen bonding interaction, at the same time, improved the adhesion between the Ag NW and the substrate. Moreover, the transmittance of the conductive film was also promoted. The as-obtained TCF exhibited an outstanding thermal stability as for heaters, which is better than the Ag NW/metal oxide and Ag NW/carbon nanotube hybrid structures. What's more, the heaters of thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU)/Ag NW/hydrogel sandwich structure were also fabricated, the performance indicated that the heaters can be used in heating suit and healthcare. We believed that this work can provide a facile method for the preparation of TCF with good practicability. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The availability of a reliable processing window is the basic requirement for processing new materials via selective electron beam melting (SEBM). Typically, these processing windows are derived by a time-consuming procedure comprising fabrication, metallographic preparation and analysis of standardized specimens for every parameter set. This study demonstrates the immediate development of a processing window during one single SEBM process. An electron optical image acquisition system provides the necessary information for evaluation and subsequent adaption of process parameters. It is shown that this immediate approach delivers processing windows with sufficient accuracy, while the required time is substantially reduced from weeks or even months to several hours.

AB A flexible composite film based piezoelectric nanogenerator has been explored using lead-free (1-x) KNaNbO3-x BaTiO3 NPs (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06 and 0.08) (used as KNN-x BTO) nanoparticles (NPs). The composite films were made of KNN-x BTO NPs impregnated into a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix. BTO was doped into the KNN lattice without affecting the orthorhombic phase of KNN. Structural analysis such as XRD and Raman spectroscopy were used to confirm the phase formation and atomic vibrations of the piezoelectric materials. Further the electrical analysis of the piezoelectric composite nanogenerator (PCNG) has been performed and the device generates a maximum electrical output of 58 V, 450 nA. Then the PCNG was used as an active sensor for sleep monitoring system by placing the PCNG in the hands and legs of human body and monitor the body movements. This type of system helps to diagnose the sleeping disorder in humans and to be a future advancement in mobile health care monitoring. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As the factors related to the pore structures, the optimized temperature of removing template at 300 degrees C and materials ratio of 1:50 made the SBA15/ACF with a high specific surface area of 1468 m(2) g(-1) and total pore volume of 0.7519 cm(3) g(-1). Compared with the existing adsorbents, the hierarchical pore structure of the composite resulted a good CO2 adsorption capacity of 4.49 mmol g(-1). The excellent CO2 adsorption capacity demonstrated that the SBA-15/ACF composite could be a promising adsorbent in the CO2 capture field. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Cathode materials that have better thermal stability, larger specific capacity and higher conductivity can efficiently improve the electrochemical performance of the batteries. In this work, we synthesized tungsten disulfide (WS2) nanosheet and investigated its applicability as cathode material for thermal battery. The WS2 is thermally stable up to 1200 degrees C. The open-circuit voltage is 1.43 V versus Li-B anode. At a current density of 150 mA cm(-2), the Li-B/WS2 single cell exhibits a specific capacity of 334.7 mA h g(-1) with a cut-off voltage of 1.0 V. The end discharge products are proved to be W and Li2S. This work provides a beginning for further applying WS2 as a promising cathode material for long-life thermal batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB To date, the exact structure of PtH, the key to resolve the controversial hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phase of SiH4, is still absent above 100 GPa. Therefore, PtH has been synthesized and its compression behavior is determined through the angle dispersive X-ray diffraction method. We find that hcp PtH keeps stable up to at least 128 GPa and its experimental lattice parameters are highly consistent with those of the hcp one in the SiH4 experiment. The present results provide reliable experimental information of PtH under high pressure, and directly clarify the debate between hcp PtH and "SiH4". (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Carbon nanotube/nanocapsule composite, mainly consisted of single walled carbon nanotube bundles with a length of a few hundred nanometres and nickel encapsulated carbon nanocapsules with 5-20 nm in diameter, have been fabricated by a facile arc discharge experiment. The cross-linked nanotube bundles provide a three-dimensional porous, conductive network and the nanocapsules adhere to nanotube bundles through Van der Waals forces to form hierarchical structures, which is beneficial to the dissipation and absorption of microwaves. The calculated reflection loss curve of the composite reflects such hierarchical structures with a thin thickness of 2 mm exhibit wide absorption bandwidth at high frequency (13.0-17.8 GHz), indicating that the as-prepared carbon nanotube/nanocapsule composite is applicable in the field of microwave absorption.

AB Poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid) (EMAA) copolymer neutralized with sodium salt is a type of ionomer with self-healing abilities. This polymer has been used as raw material for the manufacturing of nanocomposite material by the addition of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The optimization of the mixing and dispersion of the nano-reinforcement and of the extrusion process, in the polymeric matrix during extrusion, deals with the manufacturing of a homogeneous reinforced filament. The obtained filaments were used afterwards as feeding materials of a 3D polymer printing machine and tensile test samples were manufactured. Mechanical properties of both unreinforced and reinforced samples were tested. The MWCNTs-reinforced samples exhibited higher mechanical properties without affecting its self-healing ability.

AB The VO2/Cs0.32WO3 composite thermochromic films were designed to promote the practical application of the VO2-based smart windows. The addition of 0.9 wt% Cs0.32WO3 can significantly shorten the phase transition response time and improve the solar heat shielding capacity of VO2, while maintaining high visible light transmittance (49.6%) and good solar modulation ability (10.4%). Furthermore, the phase transition of the composite film can occur at indoor temperature of 30 degrees C, and the indoor temperature can be greatly reduced by 7.7 degrees C under the simulated solar irradiation. These excellent properties make the VO2/Cs0.32WO3 films promising as smart energy-saving windows. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Lead-based perovskites are currently the archetypal materials being used in photovoltaic (PV) and optoelectronic devices. Self-assembled 0D, 1D and 2D quantum perovskite structures opens up the horizon for application in solar cells (PSCs), owing to their ability to regulate the light absorption as well as the mitigation of the thermal scattering. To widen the ranging application of these perovskites, the toxic lead is essential to be replaced. Recently CsSnX3 quantum rods achieved efficiency of similar to 13%. Thus, this review aims to provide a summarized overview of lead-free PSC technologies using quantum structures which helped to gain further insights into developing green solar cells.

AB In an attempt to obtain bacterial cellulose (BC) with controllable pores, Ca-alginate particles were introduced into BC fermentation medium. Ca-alginate particles with different diameters were prepared through electrostatic spinning and pulverization. After removing the particles, a continuous and homogeneous network of pores with diameters around 5 mu m, 20 mu m, and 400 mu m were presented inside BC hydrogel. Compared to native BC, the crystallinity, the surface area and water holding capacity (WHC) were all increased when the pore sizes around 5 mu m, 20 mu m. However, the porous BC with diameters around 400 mu m showed poor performance in WHC and mechanical strength. This novel approach described in this paper introduced a new approach for creating controllable porous BC with user-defined control over the physical dimensions of the network, and slightly changed its structure.

AB Catheter-associated urinary tract infection is among the most common types of infections in the United States. One of the potential solutions is to modify the catheter surface with antimicrobial agents to prevent bacterial attachment and biofilm formation. In this study, silver nanoparticles were covalently-bonded on polyvinylchloride (PVC) film, and zinc oxide nanowires with a radiating acicular structure were then self-assembled on the composite surface. The composite film reduced the attachment of Staphylococcus aureus by nearly two orders of magnitude in 24 h. The integration of silver nanoparticles and zinc oxide nanowires holds potential for antimicrobial applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The phosphorescent Ir(III) complexes are very promising materials for optical chemosensors. In this letter, we report the synthesis of a yellow emissive phosphorescent iridium(III) complex (PFBHC)(2)Ir(acac) containing carbazole and its application for nitro-aromatic explosives detection. (PFBHC)(2)Ir(acac) displayed a high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield, and the PL quenching tests indicate sensitive detection towards kinds of nitro-aromatics (e.g. PA, TNB, DNP, TNT, DNT) with moderate Stern-Volmer quenching constants, based on a photo-induced charge transfer process. In addition, the paper strip tests of (PFBHC)(2)Ir(acac) with obvious quenching effect towards low concentration of PA or TNB demonstrate a good potential as solid nitro-aromatics sensor.

AB The retarded eta -> eta' phase transformation in Cu6Sn5 has become a potential risk to the service reliability of micro- solder joints. In this paper, both Cu6Sn5 crystal and powder samples were fabricated to explore the phase transformation behaviour of Cu6Sn5. Because of the difference in stress accumulation, eta' <-> eta(c) <-> eta and eta' <-> eta phase transformations occurred in the Cu6Sn5 core layers and surface layers, respectively. Moreover, formation of the metastable intermediate eta(c) phase was confirmed to be both stress induced and structure dependent. In addition, by decreasing the crystal size or using a proper isothermal treatment, formation of the metastable phase in Cu6Sn5 can be significantly reduced. Our study can provide an understanding of the phase transformation behaviour of Cu6Sn5 and may provide visual data for solving the risk of retarded Cu6Sn5 phase transformation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Bismuth vanadate is considered as a promising photoanode material for photoelectrochemical water splitting. However, the frequent bulk charge recombination and poor surface reaction kinetics restrict its performance in photoelectrochemical cell seriously. Herein, we developed a facile method to build a p-n heterojunction of NiO/BiVO4 with enhanced charge separation and surface reaction kinetics. The internal electric field of our heterojunction can improve the electron-hole separation efficiency from 51% to 65% at 0.6 V-RHE. Moreover, the p-type NiO can significantly enhance the surface oxygen evolution reaction kinetics. Based on these synergistic effects, our NiO/BiVO4 photoanode achieved a high solar to hydrogen efficiency of 0.72% at 0.76 V-RHE. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Al2O3 nano-powders were prepared by the reaction between aluminum salt and precipitant in micro-emulsion system of water in oil (W/O). Effects of micro-emulsion method on densification, crystal phase and microwave dielectric properties of 0.9Al(2)O(3)-0.1TiO(2) ceramics, which were prepared by using high quality nano-alumina powders as raw materials, have been investigated systematically. The results indicated that the micro-emulsion method not only effectively lowered the sintering temperature from 1700 degrees C to 1600 degrees C, but also improved the microwave dielectric properties, especially the quality factor was increased by 82%. The 0.9Al(2)O(3)-0.1TiO(2) ceramics prepared by micro-emulsion method sintered at 1600 degrees C for 3 h had the most compact and uniform microstructure, and possessed the optimal microwave dielectric properties: epsilon(r) = 11.5, Q x f = 53,892 GHz (f = 11.45 GHz), tau(f) = -8.3 ppm/degrees C.

AB To investigate the influence of the stress conduction mode on the voltage output of the magnetoelectric (ME) device, the structure of the traditional L-T type ME device was modified. The new L-T coupling mode has been mainly considered the two-phase interaction forces between ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials not only have normal stress but also shear stress. As a comparison, the textured and polished silicon wafers were used as the substrates of the AlN/Fe-Ga ME devices. The AC magnetic field was applied along the length of the device, the voltage outputs of textured ME device were 10.29 mV, 9.92 mV, 20.53 mV higher than that of polished ME device at three non-resonant frequencies 513.37 Hz, 1.13 kHz, and 5.13 kHz, respectively. Compared with polished ME device under the same condition, the voltage outputs of textured ME device were enhanced significantly. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB MnO2 nanowires/graphenated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been fabricated on stainless steel (SS) substrate through chemical vaporous deposition (CVD) and electrodeposition method as binder-free super-capacitor electrodes. The MnO2 nanowires/graphenated CNTs nanocomposites have high areal capacitance of 492.5 mF/cm(2) (615.6 F/g) at the current density of 0.5 mA/cm(2) and outstanding energy density of 985 Wh/m(2) with power density of 2.98 kW/m(2). After 5000 cycles at 0.5 mA/cm(2), the capacity retention of the MnO2/graphenated CNTs is still maintained 95% of the initial capacitance, suggesting exceptional capacitance retention and superior stability. The predominant electrochemical performance of the MnO2/graphenated CNTs is contributed to the synergistic effects of high conductivity of graphenated CNTs and high pseudocapacitance of MnO2 nanowires.

AB In the present work, asymmetric cold rolling proposed to achieve a non-basal texture in AZ91 magnesium alloy. The microstructures and corresponding texture evolution investigated. The results showed that the asymmetric cold rolling was effective to activate continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX). Interestingly, the AZ91 alloy deformed by this process exhibited non-basal texture with low intensity. The asymmetric cold rolling and initial non-basal texture stimulated the CDRX, thereby non-basal texture created. In addition, there was highly stable component (i.e., (01 (1) over bar0)[0001]) due to its low Schmid factor. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon-coated wustite nanoparticles (Fe1-xO@C) were synthesized by a one-step process of thermal decomposition at temperature 400 degrees C and the reaction time varied from 1 to 3 h. The results show that when the synthesis time (t(S)) is 1 h and 1.5 h, magnetite nanoparticles are formed alongside wustite, and an increase in the reaction time leads to the formation of phase-pure wustite nanoparticles with a carbon shell. The results of Raman spectroscopy indicate that the crystallinity of the carbon shell increases with increasing synthesis time. In addition, an increase in synthesis time influence on the value of the deviation from stoichiometry, which varies from 0.079 for the sample with t(S) = 1 h - 0.129 for the sample with t(S) = 3 h.

AB A mechanism is described for coating a polymer surface with nanoparticles (NPs) using high-power ultrasound acting on NPs suspended in liquid. The process is called "sonocoating". Nano-hydroxyapatite (HAP) NPs are used for sonocoating in this study. In the sonocoating process, according to the known "throwing stones" mechanism, liquid microjets created when cavitation bubbles implode randomly throw NPs towards the surface. In our studies, the nano-HAP layer grows laterally, forming dendrite-like patterns. We propose that the liquid streams generated by cavitation bend close to the surface and move the HAP NPs parallel to the surface. The layer nucleates when the NPs gather at surface imperfections. Subsequently, the layer grows laterally by preferential attraction of HAP NPs to the layer edges. The layer structure depends on the size of the HAP NPs and the coating duration. NPs with a mean diameter of 15 nm form a homogeneous layer faster than those with a mean diameter of 45 nm. Sonocoating is an extraordinary method for producing nano-HAP layers, since the coating takes place in water at 30 degrees C and the process duration is only 8 min. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Crystallization kinetics was widely used for studying nucleation and crystallization mechanism in the materials. In this study, the crystallization kinetics via non-isothermal method of diopside glass-ceramics prepared by incorporation and conventional techniques, have been investigated. The difference between incorporation and conventional method is the use of a simple mixed-oxide technique for producing diopside powder and the powder is then mixed with a glass batch while that of conventional one uses only simple oxides as starting precursors. Therefore, in this work, the diopside powder was calcined at 1200 degrees C for 4 h and subsequently mixed with SiO2, Al2O3 and ZnO in the 30CaMgSi(2)O(6):40SiO(2) + 20Al(2)O(3) + 10ZnO (mol%). For, the conventional method, the simple oxide powders of CaMgSi2O6 (stoichiometric composition) were used instead of the calcined CaMgSi2O6 powders, in similar glass formula. From the heating rate dependence on crystallization temperature, the activation energy (E-a) of crystallization and Avrami parameter (n) were calculated by Kissinger and Ozawa equation, respectively. It was found that these two methods show similar crystallization mechanism but the incorporation method tends to crystallize easier than that of conventional one. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB One drawback of thiol-ene mixtures is their poor shelf-life (due to a lack of stability) which limits their use in certain applications for which the compounds have to retain their activity (i.e. unreacted) for long time periods. To address this issue, the present work reports on the synthesis of a cross-linker containing a thiol group in a protected form (i.e. thioacetate). The conversion of the thioacetate groups into the corresponding thiol moieties after alkaline treatment was monitored by H-1 NMR spectroscopy. The results showed that the thioacetate groups could be deprotected within 300 min using sodium hydroxide or ammonium hydroxide. Subsequently, the synthesized thioacetate cross-linker was combined with an acrylate-based compound to form a cross-linked network in a one-pot process via sequential deprotection into a thiol and subsequent thiol-ene Michael-type addition. In-situ gel formation in a one pot-process was only achieved in the presence of ammonium hydroxide as sodium hydroxide causes hydrolysis of the cross-linkable acrylate moieties.

AB Memristors based on amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs) have attracted considerable attention recently. Here we present the study of amorphous ZnSnO (a-ZTO) memristors. The a-ZTO memristors were fabricated with Al layers as the bottom and top electrodes. The a-ZTO thin films, deposited by pulsed laser deposition, could be formed on the Al layer uniformly, and the Al layers were effective electrodes for a-ZTO memristors. It was verified that the a-ZTO memristors had obvious resistive switching (RS) behaviors, with a high ratio (similar to 10(3)) of high-resistance and low-resistance states. Almost the same current-voltage curves were observed for five cycles, revealing the stable and reliable nature of devices. Our study demonstrated the a-ZTO memristors is a potential candidate to produce high-quality resistive random-access memories, which may open a path to applications of memristors based on indium-free AOSs.

AB A facile and effective strategy is proposed to fabricate high-performance Li-S battery cathodes with a hierarchically structural Janus host composed of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and polyethyleneimine (PEI). The MWCNTs act as conductive skeleton for physical confinement of S and the PEI can chemically immobilize the S/lithium polysulfides. Benefiting from synergistic effects of the multifunctional host, the cathode can load with high S and simultaneously achieves excellent reversible capacity and outstanding rate performance. For instance, the capacity remains around 500 mAh g(-1) even after 350 cycles at 0.2 A g(-1) with a capacity decay of only 0.12% per cycle. Even at a higher rate current of 1 A g(-1), the per cycle capacity decay is only 0.1% within 160 cycles. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Interface temperature of electromagnetic pulse welding is difficult to measure by insitu methods. Here, the local temperature rise is investigated using the kinetics of precipitates and dispersoids (transformation or dissolution) at the interface zone (IZ) and affected zone (AZ) of three welds. This fine scale analysis allows estimating of local temperature range for AZ that reaches between 250 and 360 degrees C on both sides of narrow IZ, while the IZ itself experiences between 360 and 500 degrees C or even beyond 500 degrees C. The interface temperature increases with the increasing impact intensity. The current work estimated thermal field based on the precipitate transformations, which occur during the ultra-fast temperature rise at the interface in electromagnetic pulse welding.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) is a high-performance engineering plastics, being widely used in aerospace, automobile and biomedical applications. In this work, the effect of fullerenes (C-60) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) on the properties of PEEK was compared. It was found that both C-60 and GNP enhanced the modulus of PEEK significantly and the reinforcing effect was more pronounced for C-60. Most interestingly, the tan delta peak height of PEEK kept constant irrespective of the addition of C-60, while it decreased gradually with increasing the content of GNP. This study suggests that C-60 appears to be the best filler of PEEK if the damping property of the materials is a critical concern. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Spherical cementite particles in the bainitic matrix in high carbon steel processed by powder metallurgy (PM) method were produced and compared with separately sintered, fully bainitic and spherical cementite in the ferritic matrix microstructures for their microstructure-hardness-dry sliding wear properties. The primary cementite plus dense lamellar pearlite structures were achieved in the sintered specimens. The spherical cementites in the ferritic matrix (SCFM) were obtained by over-tempering of the martensite phase produced by quenching after the sintering process. To produce spherical cementite in the bainitic (SCBM) microstructure, SCFM specimens were partially austenitised at 735 degrees C over Ac-1 eutectoid temperature for 3 min and austempered at 300 degrees C for 1-2 h. Dry sliding wear resistance behavior of the specimens were examined under the constant load of 10 N at sliding distance of 1500 m. The dry sliding wear resistances of the SCBM specimens were much better than the microstructures produced by conventional heat treatments. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, CNTs are directly grown on the Ni-foam without deliberately using any catalyst and barrier layer. The CNTs coated Ni-foam is subsequently utilized as the substrate for Ge deposition, which formed a coaxial Ge/CNT nanorod structure and is evaluated as anode for lithium-ion battery. Due to the high conductivity contributed by CNTs and the strain-releasing structure derived from the coaxial nanorod, both of the rate capability and the cyclability of the anode are improved. As a result, at a high current density of 50 A/g, the anode delivered a specific capacity of 800 mAh/g. And no apparent capacity decay is detected after cycling for 300 cycles at 10 A/g.

ID EMBRITTLEMENT
AB Hydrogen effects on deformation-induced gamma-epsilon martensitic transformation were revisited in terms of morphology, number density, and fraction of epsilon-martensite in strained austenitic steel. Hydrogen charging suppresses the stress-assisted nucleation of the martensite in stress criterion, which is consistent with a previous finding that hydrogen suppresses thermally induced gamma-epsilon martensitic transformation. At an identical strain (e.g., 4%), hydrogen charging decreases the average thickness of epsilon-martensite plates, but increases their number density. As a result, hydrogen charging promotes deformation-induced gamma-epsilon martensitic transformation when compared at the identical strain. These facts provide the following two conclusions: (1) hydrogen increases the required elastic strain energy for martensite nucleation and (2) hydrogen promotes a dislocation-motion-related nucleation process.

AB Prussian blue analogues as cathode material for sodium-ion batteries suffer from poor cycling stability and inferior rate performance because of crystal defects and sluggish ion diffusion kinetics. The Na1.02Fe[Fe(CN)(6)](0.95)center dot square(0.05) Prussian blue nanoparticles with few lattice vacancies and a yolk-shell structure are designed and synthesized to address these two problems. The hierarchical structure endows yolk-shelled Prussian blue nanoparticles with large specific surface area, large pore volume and short ion pathways. As a result, the yolk-shell Prussian blue nanoparticles exhibit a high discharge capacity (140 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C), high-rate performance (51 mA h g (-1) at 10C) and excellent cycling stability (95.8% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1C).

ID DESIGN
AB In this research, 1D porous carbon nanofibers (PCFs) were prepared by electrospinning and annealing process. The PCFs with excellent microwave absorption (MA) performance were prepared by a simple one-route method by mixing with different amount of ZnCl2 in the precursors. During the process of annealing, ZnCl2 can promote the formation of porous structures and ZnO or Zn complexes by gasifying at high temperature. The porous structures can enhance the multiple reflections and the ZnO or Zn complexes can enhance the dielectric loss. The obtained PCFs were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman and XPS. The PCFs with 5 wt% ZnCl2 exhibit excellent microwave absorption properties with a minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of -51 dB at 9.1 GHz and the effective band under - 10 dB ranges from 8 to 11 GHz with a width of 3 mm. It is believed that this method would be a facile approach for preparing porous carbon fibers as lightweight microwave absorption materials. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A new protein quantification method based on first order derivative spectrophotometry was established to eliminate various interferences, mainly chitosan, to the utmost using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model food protein. Absorbance spectra of BSA solutions were recorded and their first order derivative calculated. The values of derivative absorbance at 288 nm were used to generate linear calibration curve of BSA. The new method was applied in entrapping BSA into chitosan-tripolyphosphate beads. A general calibration curve was established with a CI (width of 95% confidence interval of three repeat measurements of unknown samples) less than 0.0262 g/L and a LOQ (limit of quantification) of 0.11 g/L, showing excellent tolerance to various interferences, which was further verified by the good mass balance of BSA during encapsulation. Overall, the method successfully eliminated the interferences from chitosan and other factors to facilitate the measurement of protein in complicated environments.

AB Ultrasound-assisted extraction is an innovative technique applied to the extraction process for virgin olive oil (VOO), which is generally employed to increase plant efficiency and improve product quality. A high-power ultrasound (US) device was introduced at an industrial plant that can process at 2 tons/h to evaluate the technique's physicochemical impact on quality parameters of VOO that was caused by an intensive mass transfer induced by acoustic cavitation process and shockwaves. The impact on oil yield was also evaluated with respect to the ripening stage and malaxation time. No significant effects on the legal and commercial parameters of VOO (including quality indices, sterols, triterpene dialcohols, waxes and diacylglycerols) were found for olives at medium-early ripening stage. Significant physical changes, increased extraction yield (22.7%), enhanced phenol content (10.1%) were observed in US-VOO compared to control (C) oil extracted with a traditional process at an early maturity index.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate chemical and biological potential of garden cress (Lepidium sativum L.) to receive valuable plant extracts with potential application in pharmacy or food industry. Four techniques of extraction and three environmentally friendly solvents such as water, supercritical CO2 and ethanol have been tested. Biological activity and chemical profile were evaluated in obtained extracts. GC/MS analysis showed that SFE extract from dried sprouts of L. sativum was especially rich in such glucosinolate derivatives as benzyl cyanide and benzyl thiocyanate. However, the extract obtained from freeze-dried sprouts by SFE with addition of 96% ethanol as co-solvent was especially rich in flavonoids and simultaneously exhibited the best antimicrobial activity. Comparison of MALDI-TOF-MS spectra of all obtained extracts clearly indicates that both SFE and maceration with water are the most selective techniques of extraction due to the lowest level of interfering substances with high molecular masses.

AB A straightforward and efficient method was developed by ultrasound assisted emulsification microextraction (USAEME) combined with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP/OES) to trace some toxic heavy metal ions in eight select farmed and four select imported rice samples. In this study, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and 1-(2-pyridylazo)2-naphthol (PAN) were used as the extraction solvent and complexing reagent, respectively. The extraction parameters were optimized by means of a central composite design (CCD). Detection and quantification limits were set to be between 0.02 and 0.08 mu g L-1 and 0.07-0.30 mu g L-1, respectively. The accuracy of our method was further verified against two certified reference materials namely NCS ZC73029 and NIES No 10-b. While no trace of contaminations was found in some rice samples (Tarom, Hashemi, Sadri, Khazar and one imported sample), others such as Kazemi, Jamshidi, Dom Siah, Guilanehand and three of the imported samples were considerably polluted.

AB A fast method based on in-syringe solid phase extraction combined with dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction was developed for extraction of aflatoxins prior to HPLC-FD. Electrospun polyurethane nanofibers doped with graphene oxide were collected on a thin metal net sheet without using a binder, placed into a filter holder between filter papers on a syringe tip and used as an efficient adsorbent for the first time. The major parameters affecting whole extraction efficiency were investigated and optimized. Under the optimum conditions, the limits of detection and the limits of quantification were in the range of 0.09-0.15 and 0.3-0.5 mu g kg(-1), respectively. The linear dynamic range was 0.3-1000 mu g kg(-1 )withdetermination coefficients of 0.9946-0.9965. The inter-and intra-day precisions were lower than 4.3 and 7.2%, respectively. The method was successfully applied for the determination of aflatoxins B-1, B-2, G(1), and G(2) in soybeans and satisfactory relative recoveries of 76-101% were achieved.

AB Calcium chloride (1% w/w, CaCl2) and pectin methylesterase (PME) (15 U/mL) were vacuum impregnated (VI) into jujubes to preserve their quality. The nanostructure of jujube pectin was investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to determine the degradation mechanism of pectin. CCaCl2 with PME under VI treatment (VI + Ca + PME) maintained jujubes' quality. Weight loss in VI + Ca + PME group at day 56 was only 60.36% of that in control group (CK). Firmness, soluble solids content, and ascorbic acid content of jujubes in VI + Ca + PME group were higher than those in CK. Firmness was highly positively correlated with sodium carbonate-soluble pectin (SSP) content. According to AFM results, frequencies of molecules with a width >= 60 nm of water-soluble pectin (WSP), chelate-soluble pectin (CSP), and SSP were the highest in VI + Ca + PME group at the end of storage. WSP, CSP, and SSP degradation was delayed by VI + Ca + PME treatment. The quality of jujubes was effectively maintained by VI + Ca + PME treatment.

AB Stable carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13) for glucose, fructose, disaccharides, trisaccharides, and organic acids in 116 commercial honey samples were measured by LC/IRMS. On the basis of EA/IRMS and LC/IRMS authenticity criteria, 39 of the samples were judged to have been adulterated. The delta C-13 values for organic acids from pure honey, reported here for the first time, ranged from -33.6 to - 26.5 parts per thousand. The mean Delta delta C-13 (glucose-organic acids) value was +3.7 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand. Glucose and organic acid delta C-13 values were strongly correlated (R = 0.71, P < 0.001). Gluconic acid, the predominant organic acid in honey, has been reported to be produced via decomposition of glucose by bee glucose-oxidase and certain Gluconobacter spp. This fact was confirmed by isotope analysis.

AB The morphological characteristics and health-promoting components (anthocyanins, phenolic compounds, carotenoids, and ascorbic acid) together with the in-vitro antioxidant capacity of hips collected from four rose species (Rosa canina, R. corymbifera, R. micrantha, and R. sempervirens) growing in Sicily (South Italy) were evaluated. The results revealed significant variability among the rose species as the hips collected from R. canina and R. sempervirens exhibited the highest total polyphenol contents (6784.5 and 6241.2 mg GAE/100 g DW, respectively) and highest antioxidant activities, whereas R. canina and R. micrantha hips had the highest total anthocyanin contents (2.94 and 3.86 mg CGE/100 g DW, respectively). The data showed that the analysed Sicilian rose hips have good nutritional quality, making them suitable as functional foods according to their biochemical composition and as promising sources of natural antioxidants. Also, these findings confirm that rose pseudo-fruits contain significant amounts of secondary metabolites that may positively affect human health.

AB Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) have the ability to modify ice crystal growth and thus there is great interest in identifying new sources of these compounds. All extracts of cold acclimated leaves of Drimys angustifolia, obtained using different buffers, inhibited recrystallization and they presented similar SDS-PAGE profiles, with bands close to 20 and 37 kDa. The extract obtained using Tris-HCl/DDT buffer (pH 8) was used in the pre-treatment of frozen star fruit (Averrhoa carambola) by immersion or vacuum infiltration. The treatments did not affect the titratable acidity, pH, soluble solids, ascorbic acid content and colour. However, only star fruits that were vacuum infiltrated with AFPs retained their drip loss constant after 15 days. Moreover, with this treatment the star fruit firmness was maintained on thawing after 60 days of storage. The vacuum infiltration of Drimys angustifolia AFPs into the star fruit allowed an initial cryoprotection, indicating that the application of AFPs can increase the quality of frozen star fruit.

AB The compositions and contents of antioxidant components and antioxidant attributes (scavenging DPPH radicals, TEAC, ferric reducing power and inhibiting Cu2+-induced human LDL oxidation) for the leaves of eight persimmon varieties harvested from Sep. to Nov. were determined. Harvest time and variety were important factors affecting the compositions and contents of phenolic compounds in persimmon leaves; moreover, phenolic contents (polyphenol, flavonoid, condensed tannin and phenolic acid) of the leaves were significantly correlated with their antioxidant activities. For each variety, the leaves harvested in months with higher temperature, solar radiation and sunshine duration had higher phenolic contents contributing to better antioxidant properties (ranking: Sep. > Oct. > Nov.). In addition, the compositions and contents of phenolic components and antioxidant capacities for the leaves from various persimmon varieties were also different. The leaves of persimmon varieties belonging to pollination constant and astringent (PCA) had higher phenolic contents and also presented better antioxidant effects.

AB Developing selective and sensitive methods for tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) detection is of great significance to ensure the quality and safety of food. Herein, an electrochemical sensor was designed for selective and sensitive detection of TBHQ by integrating molecularly imprinted polymer, noble metal nanoparticles and carbon materials. The electrochemical sensor exhibited excellent performance for sensitive determination of TBHQ. The linear range was 0.5-60 mu g mL(-1) with a low detection limit of 0.046 mu g mL(-1). In addition, the results obtained by electrochemical method were well agreement with the detection results obtained by HPLC with good recoveries ranging from 99.4 to 108.5% in spiked edible oil samples. The present study not only has theoretical value to establish new methods for rapid detection of food additives but also has potential application values for monitoring the overuse of TBHQ.

AB Aspergillus quadrilineatus RSNK-1 produced a multi-enzymatic system containing (U/gds) beta-mannanase (1021), endo-xylanase (1 9 1), alpha-galactosidase (3.42), beta-xylosidase (0.07) and beta-glucosidase (0.28) on low-cost copra meal (CM) in SSF. The enzyme preparation was covalently immobilized on aluminum oxide pellets (3 mm) under statistically optimized conditions leading to 73.17% immobilization yield. The immobilized enzyme (Man-AOP) displayed enhanced thermal and pH stability. Man-AOP was characterized by FTIR, SEM and PXRD revealing a covalent interaction. The bio-conjugate was successfully recycled for mannooligosaccharide (MOS) generation from locust bean gum (LBG) up to 10 cycles, yielding an average of 0.95 mg MOS/cycle. Man-AOP was also effective in clarification of apple, kiwi, orange and peach juices and enhanced their reducing sugar content. The bio-conjugate was useful in generation of MOS from mannan and enrichment of fruit juices.

AB The effect of three combinations of bioprocessing methods by lactic acid fermentation, cell wall hydrolyzing enzymes and phytase on the biochemical (protein, fat, carbohydrate composition) and technofunctional properties (protein solubility, emulsifying and foaming properties) of wheat bran protein isolates were evaluated. The bioprocessing increased the protein (up to 80%) and fat content (up to 22.8%) in the isolates due to the degradation of starch and soluble pentosans. Additional proteins, globulin 3A and 3C, chitinase, beta-amylase and LMW glutenins, were identified from the electrophoretic pattern of the protein isolate bioprocessed with added enzymes. Generally, the bioprocessed protein isolate had lower protein solubility and stronger net charge in pH below 7, when compared to the protein isolate made without bioprocessing. The emulsifying properties of the protein isolates were not affected by bioprocessing. However, the foaming stability of the protein isolates was nearly doubled by bioprocessing with cell wall hydrolyzing enzymes and phytase.

AB Sucrose acts as a vital signal that modulates fruit ripening. In current study, 50 mM sucrose was applied in strawberry fruit to investigate the regulation of sucrose in anthocyanin synthesis after harvest. The results showed that sucrose treatment increased the contents of glucose, fructose and sucrose, which were 19.76%, 15.83% and 16.50% higher, respectively, compared with control at the end of storage. The increase of glucose and fructose contents resulted from the activation of acid invertase by sucrose treatment. In addition, sucrose treatment specifically increased four pelargonidin derivatives, pelargonidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-rutinoside, pelargonidin 3-malonylglucoside and pelargonidin 3-methylmalonyglucoside, during the storage. Further, transcriptional profiles and enzyme activities analysis revealed that the accumulation of pelargonidin derivatives was related to the activation of the pentose phosphate pathway, shikimate pathway, phenylpropanoid pathway, and flavonoid pathway. These results provided new insights into the regulation of sucrose on the accumulation of individual anthocyanins.

AB Effects of adlay starch on the rheological and conformational changes in wheat gluten gel were investigated in this study. Rheological measurement showed that adlay starch-gluten composite gels exhibited higher storage modulus G' and loss modulus G '' compared with pure gluten gels. This result was also confirmed through morphological analysis. As the addition of adlay starch increased from 0% to 40%, the surface hydrophobicity of gluten protein gel decreased from 16,660 to 11,931 and the free thiol content increased from 3.11 to 4.30 mu mol/g. In addition, the beta-sheet structure in the gluten protein gel increased at the expense of the alpha-helical structure with increasing adlay starch fraction. This study revealed that besides acting as an inert filler, adlay starch could participate in hydrogen bonding and induce the enhancement of hydrophobic interaction to modify gluten protein association, altering the rheological and structural properties of gluten protein gels.

AB There are various indicators, including FAO and EU sources, that edible insects could become one of the solutions to the problem of global food supply. This report was aimed at improving the knowledge on powdered crickets (Acheta domesticus). The analyses of the basic nutritional composition revealed that cricket powders were rich in protein (42.0-45.8% of dry matter) and fat (23.6-29.1% of dry matter). In terms of mineral content, CPs were rich in Ca, Mg and Fe. Most of all, the levels of Cu, Mn and Zn were especially high (2.33-4.51, 4.1-12.5, 12.8-21.8 mg/100 g of dry matter, respectively). Furthermore, the analyses into the proteins indicated that the cricket powders were treated with high temperatures and allowed the determination of four cricket-specific peptides that showed sufficient thermostability to serve as markers for authentication.

AB A novel and simple method for detecting six isoflavones in Cheonggukjang using liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed. The method validation was performed in terms of linearity, sensitivity, selectivity, accuracy and precision. The limits of detection (LODs) for the instrument employed in these experiments ranged from 0.15 mu g/kg to 1.50 mu g/kg, and the limits of quantification (LOQs) ranged from 0.50 mu g/kg to 5.00 mu g/kg. The average recoveries of the six isoflavones ranged from 82.3% to 98.9%. Before assessing the uncertainty of the measurements, we identified the factors that affect the measured value using quantitative analysis to determine how each factor affects the measurement result. It was found that the sample weighing, standard material purity, dilution, calibration curve and reproducibility factor affect the uncertainty of measurement. The developed method was specific and reliable. Therefore, the method is suitable for the routine analysis of isoflavones in Cheonggukjang.

AB Granular V-type crystalline starch (V-type starch) was prepared using different starch varieties by alcoholic-alkaline treatment. Carbon dioxide was encapsulated into V-type starch using a solid encapsulation method. The morphological and structural properties of the inclusion complexes (ICs) were characterised using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and C-13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance proved that CO(2 )was successfully encapsulated. The encapsulation capacity of V-type starches was determined by head space gas chromatography, and ICs made from normal maize starch achieved the highest CO2 concentration (2.55%, w/w). The controlled release characteristics of ICs were also determined at various temperatures and relative humidity, and ICs made from normal potato starch exhibited slower release characteristics. The release kinetics showed that the release of CO2 from ICs was accelerated by increasing temperature or RH. V-type starch is a renewable, inexpensive material for encapsulation of gasses such as CO2.

AB Five gelatinized jackfruit starches (GJFSS: Ml', M5', M6', M11', and BD') were prepared using amylose mixed with five types of amylopectin. M1' had the lowest degree of polymerization while BD' had the highest. The five GJFSS samples showed significant variations in microstructures, varying from a compact structure (M1') to a loose structure (BD'). The freeze-thaw stability was consistent with results of the microstructure. High syneresis formed compact structure (M1'), and low syneresis formed a loose structure (BD'). As the degree of polymerization of amylopectin increased, the gelatinization enthalpy, peak viscosity, breakdown, final viscosity, setback, and absorbance ratio decreased, while the transition temperature and pasting temperature increased. The thermal, pasting properties, and the short-range molecular order, were consistent with the results of the microstructure and syneresis. All the results indicated that the degree of polymerization of amylopectin is an important structural factor that can significantly affect the gelatinization properties of starch.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of different molecular weights of chitosan treatment (LM 30 kDa; HM 120 kDa) on fruit senescence related to redox state and respiratory pathway metabolism in postharvest nectarine fruit stored at 25 degrees C for 8 days. The treatments of LM and HM chitosan both delayed senescence, which are due to inhibition of respiration rate, and enhanced the antioxidant system, as evidenced by the improvement of ASA-GSH cycle and total phenolics and flavonoids contents and decrease in H2O2 and MDA accumulation. Meanwhile, fruit treated with HM chitosan manifested better quality and redox state than LM. It is noteworthy that the results showed that HM chitosan notably suppressed the activity of SDH enzyme and increased the total activity of G-6-PDH and 6-PGDH. Accordingly, changed respiratory pathways by HM chitosan coating contributed to senescence retardation and modification of redox status in postharvest nectarine fruit.

AB Introducing okara to develop high-fiber tofu (HFT) can effectively increase the utilization of soy residues as well as enhance the nutrition of tofu. However, okara degrades the glucono-delta-lactone (GDL)-induced tofu quality. Current results showed that microbial transglutaminase (TGase) remarkably enhanced the gel strength, water holding capacity and viscoelasticity of HFT. During heating of soymilk, AB and A(1,2,4) subunits of 11S were more prone to aggregate via disulfide (SS) bonds to form larger soluble protein aggregates under neutral condition, while the SS-mediated insoluble aggregates were formed under acid condition by GDL and predominantly contributed to the structure of tofu without TGase. TGase-induced intermolecular epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl) lysine strengthened protein network and contributed the most to HFT structure. TGase promoted formation of protein aggregates more orderly, and okara was well-wrapped by protein network. These results demonstrated that the macro-protein aggregates crosslinked by TGase conspicuously strengthened the gel network and significantly elevated the HFT quality.

AB This study applied an in vitro fermentation model, whereby the catabolism of Porphyra haitanensis polysaccharides (PHP) was monitored coupled with the variations of microbiota composition and the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), so as to assess the effects of PHP on human intestinal microbiota. After 24 h anaerobic incubation, the level of microflora diversity increased significantly, as the microbiome structure was reshaped through promotion of intestinal probiotics proliferation and inhibition of pathogens growth. Besides, the final concentration of total SCFAs increased to 32.32 +/- 1.81 mmol/L, and contained high amounts of acetic, propionic and butyric acid. Furthermore, the molecular weight of PHP decreased from 2.623 x 10(5)g/mol to 2.308 x 10(4)g/mol. The degree of polymerization of oligosaccharide products ranged from 2 to 9, with the main linkage patterns being 1 -> 3 and 1 -> 4 linked Galp. The current study provides new insight on the probiotic activity of PHP within the human gastrointestinal tract.

AB In this study, effect of cross-linking with 4% sodium trimetaphosphate on the structural and adsorptive properties of porous wheat starches was investigated. The results showed that the cross-linked porous starches (CLPS) exhibited lower solubility, swelling power and ordered structure but higher thermal stability compared with the corresponding porous starches (PS). Cross-linking led to the formation of more dense holes on the surfaces of PS, as observed by SEM. XPS results demonstrated that phosphate groups were bound to the -OH groups on starches by covalent bonds (C-O-P). Adsorption experiments manifested that the CLPS exhibited higher adsorption capacities for water, oil and methylene blue compared to the corresponding PS. Furthermore, the isothermal data of the CLPS fitted the Langmuir isotherm model well compared to Freundich and Tempkin models, and the adsorption was exothermic and favorable. These results suggest that cross-linking modification can improve the thermal stability and adsorptive properties of PS.

AB Ingredients added in food products can increase the nutritional value, but also affect their functional properties. After processing, determination of added ingredients is difficult, thus it is important to develop rapid techniques for quantification of food ingredients. In the current work, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) were investigated to quantify the amount of fiber added to semolina and its distribution. NIR spectra were acquired to compare the accuracy in the classification, quantification and distribution of fibers added to semolina. Principal Component Analyses (PCA) and Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) were used for classification. Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) models applied to NIR-HSI spectra showed R-p(2), between 0.85 and 0.98, and RMSEP between 0.5 and 1%, and were used for prediction map of the samples. These results showed that NIR-HSI technique can be used for the identification and quantification of fiber added to semolina.

AB The commercial mango cultivar Keitt lacks a theoretical foundation for aroma control during processing. To discriminate the aroma-active compounds in fresh mango juice, odor activity value (OAV) and detection frequency analysis (DFA) were used collaboratively. A total of 12 components were identified as major aroma-active compounds, among which 2,4-dimethylstyrene was firstly confirmed as an aroma compound in mango. The changes of aromatic compounds during pasteurization and high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) sterilization were further studied. Quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA) was applied to validate the sensory differences. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on aroma compound variation coincided with the overall note. QDA demonstrated that fresh mango juice was the most accepted, followed by HHP and pasteurized juices. The finding might be well correlated with the differences in 6 odor notes. This work would help to better understand and control the critical aroma determinants for mango juice processing.

AB Although the connection between protein oxidation, amyloid aggregation and diseases such as Alzheimer's is well known there is no information on such effects during preparation of beta-lactoglobulin fibrils. Different morphologies of amyloid aggregates of beta-lactoglobulin were prepared by incubation at pH 2 or pH 3.5 for up to 72 h. After 5 h, amyloid aggregates at pH 2 formed typical fibrils, which consisted of peptides. At pH 3.5, the amyloid aggregates were worm-like and consisted of intact protein. After 72 h, the building blocks at both pH values changed towards smaller peptides. The apparent tyrosine oxidation reached a maximum after 5 h at both pH values, whereas N-formylkynurenine and carbonyls increased continuously during 72 h. In case amyloid structures are used as edible material, the health related effects caused by protein oxidation needs to be considered.

AB A novel method for producing germinated brown rice (GBR) was developed by cyclic cellulase conditioning and germination treatment. Changes in the y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content and the cooking and taste qualifies of GBR were analysed. The results indicated GABA accumulation reached its highest level under 50 mg/ml cellulase solution treatment for 90 min followed by 32 h germination at 30 degrees C. The treatment conditions had no significant influence on the cooking or taste qualifies of GBR. Correlation analysis showed the taste value of cooked GBR significantly correlated with hardness, springiness, chewiness, and stickiness. The cyclic cellulase conditioning treatment could contribute to improved cooking and taste qualifies of GBR and higher GABA content of GBR compared to the soaking treatment. The cooking and taste qualifies of GBR were improved by the degradation of the crude fibre of the cortex and the increase in GBR water absorption rate under cyclic cellulase conditioning.

AB This study was designed to investigate the differences in the proteomes of high- and low-quality goat and bovine muscles. In total, 364 and 111 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in the high-quality/low-quality bovine and goat samples, respectively. The bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that DEPs are involved in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) and oxidative phosphorylation. An analysis of quality-related DEPs showed that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (NADH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) could be potential biomarkers for colour, while enolase (ENO) can be used as a marker protein for tenderness qualifies in goat. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and 14-3-3 protein can indicate goat and bovine tenderness, while heat-shock proteins (HSPs) can also be used as tenderness marker proteins for different species. Glycerin-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) can be used as a protein to detect fat content, and guanine ribonucleotide-binding protein (G protein) may be a flavour marker protein in bovine meat.

AB Preparation of selenium-enriched probiotics and Se-enrichment of probiotic-fermented blended juices were performed and optimized using orthogonal test. Se content had a significant 13.0-fold increase by the addition of 1% Se-enriched Streptococcus thermophilus starters in juice fermentation. Chemical properties of fermented blended juices were determined. Reducing sugar content decreased significantly after fermentation, and the same downtrend was observed for free amino acids and organic acids, with lactic acid being an exception. Meanwhile, dynamic variation analysis of flavor components during the fermentation, and characteristic aroma-active compounds before and after fermentation were demonstrated by GC-MS and GC-O. Eleven aroma-active substances were identified from juices without fermentation, while 7 characteristic compounds were detected in fermented juices. Furthermore, potential correlations between chemical and flavor characteristics were explored based on multivariate statistical analysis. These results indicate that a potential Se-enriched fermented beverage was established, and the fermentation process led to differences in the chemical substrates and impact odorants.

AB Ethoxyquin (EQ) is an additive present in fish feed and its fate in fish should be carefully characterized due to food safety concerns regarding this compound. Therefore, the objective of this work was to identify the transformation products (TPs) of EQ in Atlantic salmon. Salmon in independent tanks were given feed containing ethoxyquin concentrations of 0.5 mg/kg, 119 mg/kg or 1173 mg/kg for 90 days. After the feeding trial, salmon fillets were extracted in acetonitrile and analyzed by liquid chromatography with traveling-wave ion mobility spectrometry coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-TWIMS-QTOFMS). EQ was transferred from the feed to salmon fillets and 23 TPs were characterized, resulting from dimerization, oxygenation, cleavage, cleavage combined with oxygenation, cleavage combined with conjugation, and other uncategorized alterations. Moreover, EQ and some TPs were also detected in commercial salmon randomly sampled from different Norwegian fish farms. This study confirmed that the dimer 1,8'-EQDM was the main TP of EQ and, together with previous research, brought the overall number of characterized TPs to a total of 47.

AB Chemometric techniques were employed to discriminate two Indonesian seaweed cultivars (Kappaphycus alvarezii and Sargassum thoplicatum) based on their physico-functional properties. Data of physico-functional properties, including emulsifying activity and bulk density, were processed using multivariate, discriminant analysis (DA), principal component analysis (PCA), and cluster analysis (CA). Significant differences (p < 0.05) and discrimination (multivariate analysis (F-9,F-14 = 57.85; Wilks's lambda = 0.02, p < 0.0001)) were determined among physico-functional properties of seaweed powders. In addition, DA method clarified (Lambda = 0.02 and chi(2) = 63.74) variations between samples along with two discriminate functions. Moreover, PCA (49.63% with Eigenvalues > 1) and CA (clusters 1 and 2) methods confirmed that the seaweed samples possessed differing physico-functional properties, which implied their distinctive use in food product development. Overall, our results demonstrated strong variation in seaweed powers using chemometrics, which might contribute to the rapid applicability of chemometrics in evaluating novel food material.

AB Fusarium rot of muskmelon is a common and frequently-occurring postharvest disease, which leads to quality deterioration and neosolaniol (NEO) contamination. New strategies to control postharvest decay and reduce NEO contamination are of paramount importance. The effects of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) treatment on the growth of Fusarium sulphureum in vitro, and Fusarium rot development and NEO accumulation in fruits inoculated with F. sulphureum in vivo were investigated. The results showed that ASA inhibited the growth of F. sulphureum, evident morphological and major cellular changes were observed under the microscope. In vivo testing showed that 3.2 mg/mL ASA significantly suppressed Fusarium rot development and NEO accumulation after 6 and 8 d of pathogen inoculation. Meanwhile, Tri gene expressions involved in NEO biosynthesis were down-regulated after treatment. Taken together, ASA treatment not only reduced Fusarium rot development by inhibiting the growth of F. sulphureum, but decreased NEO accumulation by suppressing NEO biosynthesis pathway.

MLA yield of 38% was attained even at glucose concentration of 10 wt% and the space-time yield reached 7.1 g L-1 h(-1). The action mechanism of WO3 was investigated. Fine WO3 particles adsorbed on surface of Sn-Beta-P in reaction media and decreased the silanol defects of Sn-Beta-P. This promotes retro-aldol of fructose, the rate-determining step of whole reaction, thus facilitated the formation of MLA. Kinetic studies indicate that the presence of WO3 decreased the activation energy of the retro-aldol of fructose. The binary solid WO3 and Sn-Beta-P is recyclable.

AB The effect of ohmic-vacuum heating conditions (OHVC) was evaluated on quality parameters during concentration process of orange juice and compared with ohmic heating process under atmospheric conditions (OHAC) and conventional vacuum heating (CVH). The decline of vitamin C in OHVC treatments (10-29.2%) was lower than the OHAC (18.0-38.8%) and CVH (47.4%). Changes of pH for OHVC were lower than OHAC and CVH. The difference in total phenol content of fresh and concentrated juice was 8.0-21.3% for OHVC and 18.5-42.8% for OHAC and 49.6% for CHV. Antioxidant capacity of treatments was lower than the fresh sample at same water content. Increasing of voltage gradient had a positive effect on the saving of vitamin C and total phenol and processing time. Finally, it can be resulted that the combine of vacuum treatment with ohmic heating (as hybrid ohmic-vacuum heating) could maintain food quality parameters.

AB Rice is a staple food in many countries around the world and it is a source of not only the nutrients, but also toxic elements. In this study, we evaluated four degrees of polishing and determined the elemental content (P, S, K, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Mo, Cd, Hg, Pb) in brown rice, rice bran and the resulting white rice using microwave assisted decomposition followed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) detection. Additionally, individual rice grains at every polishing step were analyzed by laser ablation ICP-MS to generate elemental distribution maps. While P, K, Mn and Fe were predominantly located in bran layer, S, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Mo, Cd, and Hg were present in both the bran and endosperm. As the elemental distribution in the grain varies, polishing to produce white rice results in removal of different amounts of nutrient and toxic elements.

AB Metaplexis japonica (Thunb.) Makino is widely distribution and cultivated as a vegetable in China. Chemical studies revealed that its stem and root are rich in polysaccharides, flavonoids, polyphenols, and steroids, which also exhibited interesting activities. However, little attention has been focused on the biological constituents in the fruits of M. japonica. In order to achieve the best use of M. japonica, a chemical investigation of the secondary metabolites of the fruits of M. japonica was performed, and led to the isolation of one new (1), along with eight known flavoniod derivatives (2-9). The antioxidant and antibacterial properties of the crude extract and compound 1 were deeply evaluated through antioxidant and antimicrobial assays. Among them, the crude extract showed significant antioxidant activities in all assays, as well as broad-spectrum antibacterial effects. These results suggested that crude extract of M. japonica would be a potential source as a possible preservatives for foods.

AB A method was developed to simultaneously determine eight bioactive compounds in edible oil based on ultrasound-assisted saponification, liquid-liquid extraction and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Central composite design was employed to optimize ultrasonic temperature and time of saponification. Sample treatment was conducted by ultrasound-assisted saponification at temperature of 75 degrees C for 40 min. Limits of detection and limits of quantification ranged from 2.0 to 3.2 and from 6.1 to 10.0 ng/mL, respectively. Linear correlations were obtained (R-2 > 0.99) and the recoveries at three spiked levels were between 81.7% and 112.0%. This method was employed to determine eight compounds in camellia oils and olive oils. As results, the contents of stigmasterol, delta-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol, beta-carotene and lutein in camellia oils were significantly higher than those in olive oils (p < 0.05). The proposed method can be successfully used to determination of these eight active compounds in camellia oil and other edible oils.

AB The role of Reactive Carbonyl Species (RCS) derived from the Maillard reaction and ascorbic acid degradation on brown color formation was investigated in orange juice during storage. Eight RCS were monitored in aseptic juice over an 8-week period under refrigerated (4 degrees C) and accelerated conditions (35 degrees C). Significant changes in RCS concentrations were reported and positively correlated with color formation. Recombination experiments demonstrated the significant role of 3-deoxyglucosone and acetol on color formation as well as their interactions with glyoxal and methylglyoxal that lead to an increase in browning. Isotopic enrichment techniques further identified fructose as the main precursor of RCS, indicating the important role of Maillard reaction as a mechanism of non-enzymatic browning during orange juice storage. Finally, among the amino acids, tryptophan and glutamine showed the largest percentage losses in orange juice during storage and were reported to significantly impact the RCS composition and color formation.

AB The changes in the bioactive phytochemicals of six cultivars of Thai germinated brown rice (GBR) were monitored in parallel to those of cold plasma-treated GBR (PGBR). After treatment with the optimal plasma conditions, the germination percentage, root length, and seedling height measurements of the most sensitive rice cultivar increased by 84%, 57%, and 69%, respectively. For all of the rice cultivars, there were no significant differences in the antioxidant activities of the GBRs and PGBRs. Conversely, higher contents of gamma-oryzanols were observed in the PGBR group than in the GBR group during the 2-day germination period. Certain cultivars in the PGBR group reached their maximum values for total phenolic compounds, total vitamin E, certain simple phenolics, phytosterols, triterpenoids, and anthocyanins one day earlier than the same values for GBR. In contrast, the concentrations of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline in both the GBR and PGBR samples were reduced significantly with increased germination time.

AB Dried tangerine peel (DTP) is an excellent plant resource that has been used as ingredients for both food and traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, the efficiency of four different dietary preparation methods (i.e. soaking, boiling, steaming, and ethanol extraction) in extraction of functional compounds (i.e. flavonoids and essential oil constituents) from DTP was evaluated systematically for the first time. To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the extraction of the functional compounds, a synthetic evaluation model based on a weighting method was established. The optimum conditions of each dietary preparation method (e.g., time, temperature, solid-liquid ratio, etc.) were determined by response surface methodology. Ethanol extraction showed the best extraction efficiency, followed by soaking, boiling, and steaming. Additionally, different DTP extracts were shown to be clearly distinguished by electronic eye and electronic tongue. This research provides essential findings for the effective dietary instruction of DTP consumption.

AB The ultrasound-microwave assisted HCl extraction of pectin from potato pulp was optimized using the response surface methodology. Effects of extraction temperature, pH, and time on the yield were evaluated, and structural characteristics of pectin extracted under optimal conditions were determined. The yield was 22.86 +/- 1.29% under optimal conditions of temperature 93 degrees C, pH 2.0, and time 50 min. The obtained pectin was rich in branched rhamnogalacturonan I (61.54 mol%). Furthermore, the pectin was a low-methoxyl (degree of methylation, 32.58%) but highly acetylated (degree of acetylation, 17.84%) pectin and the molecular weight was 1.537 x 10(5)g/mol. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance indicated that pectin had a linear region of a-1, 4-linked galacturonic acids which could be methyl and acetyl-esterified, and rhamnose linked with galacturonic acid to form rhamnogalacturonan which was branched with side chains. Scanning electron microscopy showed most of pectin had a lamellae structure.

AB Ten sesame genotypes planted under two irrigation regimes of 60% and 90%, as the maximum allowable depletion (MAD), were used to investigate the effects of drought stress on certain quantitative and qualitative characters of sesame seeds with four contrasting coat colors. The polyphenolic components, sesamin, sesamolin, total flavonoid content (TFC), total phenolic content (TPC), radical scavenging activity (RSA), seed yield, and oil content of the seeds were also examined. Results revealed that drought decreased seed yield, oil content, sesamin, and quercetin but increased TFC, TPC, and RSA as well as most of polyphenolic components and sesamolin. The drought-tolerant genotypes including Markazil exhibited higher chlorogenic, ellagic, and p-coumaric acids as well as TFC, RSA, and rutin. While the dark-seeded sesame genotypes contained higher caffeic, ferulic, ellagic acids as well as TPC and RSA, the light-seeded ones were richer in sesamin and sesamolin as well as p-coumaric and gallic acids. The findings of the study provided basic information on the changes in some seed secondary metabolites when sesame was subjected to drought stress. The results also confirmed not only the presence of considerable amounts of antioxidants in sesame seeds but also differences in secondary metabolite levels among the sesame seeds with different seed coat colors.

AB The effects of postharvest treatment with sodium silicate (Si) (100 mM) on mitochondrial ROS production and energy metabolism of the muskmelon fruits (cv. Yujinxiang) on development of defense responses to Trichothecium roseum were studied. Si treatment decreased decay severity of inoculated muskmelons, enhanced the activities of energy metabolism of key enzymes and kept the intracellular ATP at a higher level; meanwhile, Si also induced the mtROS accumulation such as H2O2 and superoxide anion. TMT-based quantitative proteomics analysis revealed that a total of 24 proteins with significant differences in abundance involved in energy metabolism, defense and stress responses, glycolytic and TCA cycle, and oxidation-reduction process. It is suggested by our study that melon fruit mitochondria, when induced by Si treatments, play a key role in priming of host resistance against T. roseum infection through the regulation of energy metabolism and ROS production in the pathogen infected muskmelon fruits.

AB Folates are essential micronutrients in the human diet. Germplasm rich in folates can be used as genetic resource for diet and breeding to produce new varieties with enhanced folates. To investigate the natural variation of folates among wheat cultivars and identify high folate materials for breeding, we studied the grain folate contents of 360 wheat samples consisting of 315 wheat genotypes grown in North China using the high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method. The total folate content among wheat genotypes ranged from 10.15 +/- 2.86 to 91.44 +/- 5.64 mu g per 100 g grains, thus showing a remarked variation. Fifty-two wheat cultivars, such as Henong58-3, were identified as good sources of folates. 5-Formyltetrahydrate and 5-methyltetrahydrate were found to be the two major folate derivatives in wheat germplasm. In addition, we found that environment factor also had significant effect on folate production. This investigation can help wheat breeders for folate improvement.

AB The sample extraction process is considered as the essential step in the pesticide residue analysis, as it provides the base for the detection of the pesticides in trace level. Various factors need to be optimized during the extraction of pesticides due to the complexity of the matrix which is time-consuming and tedious. Therefore, the use of experimental design in the optimization process proves to be effective with minimum experiments and cost. This paper is aimed to overview the experimental designs that are frequently used for screening (full factorial, fractional factorial, Plackett-Burman Design) and optimizing (central composite design, Box-Behnken design, Taguchi design, Doehlert design, D-optimal design) the most influential factors to provide a sequential understanding of the linear and complex interactions in the pesticide extraction methods. Further, a systematic approach has been discussed about the use of experimental designs in pesticide extraction and also the softwares used for application-oriented readers.

AB The effects of stearic acid addition followed by hydrothermal treatment on the functional properties of maize starch were studied. Addition of stearic acid followed by hydrothermal treatment resulted in non-gelling starch. Starch with stearic acid had significantly (P < 0.05) higher viscosity as compared to heat-moisture treated starch. There was no significant difference on the pasting properties of starch with stearic acid alone and in combination with annealing. Stearic acid addition followed by heat-moisture treatment significantly reduced starch susceptibility to acid hydrolysis as compared to stearic acid alone and heat-moisture treatment alone. These changes related well with the increased amylose lipid complexes and relative crystallinity observed by the DSC and XRD, suggesting that heat-moisture treatment promoted amylopectin side chain crosslinking and amylose-stearic acid complex formation. Stearic acid addition followed by hydrothermal treatment produced a 'clean label' starch that can potentially substitute chemically cross-linked and non-gelling starch in the food industry.

AB In the present study, the nutritional value, bioactive properties, and chemical composition of various cardoon (Cynara cardunculus L.) genotypes cultivated in central Greece were investigated. The results demonstrated that Cynara seeds are a good source of fat and protein, while they also contain considerable amounts of K, Mg, and Fe and low amount of Na. Sucrose, oxalic acid, and alpha-tocopherol were the only free sugar, organic acid, and tocopherol isoform respectively, found among the studied genotypes. The most abundant fatty acids were linoleic, oleic and palmitic acid, while PUFA was the most abundant fatty acid class. All the tested seeds contained only two phenolic compounds, namely 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid and 3,5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, while significant antioxidant activities and cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines and antimicrobial effects were also observed. In conclusion, cardoon seed extracts could be exploited in the food and pharmaceutical industries as alternative sources of natural compounds with bioactive properties.

AB In Taiwan, crab is one of the main causes for food allergy. Several proteins are recognized as crustacean allergens, and tropomyosin is known to be the major one. However, sensitization patterns of Taiwanese patients to crustacean allergens remain unclear. Therefore, we analyzed the specific-IgE binding ability of crucifix crab (Charybdis feriatus) allergens by western blot using patients' sera. In particular, we found a 56 kDa protein in crucifix crab reacted with specific-IgEs in patients' sera, and we further identified the protein as a novel crab allergen pyruvate kinase 2. Additionally, little is known about tropomyosin contents in crabs consumed in Taiwan. Thus, we also quantified the levels of tropomyosin by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) among raw and cooked crab species. Our results showed tropomyosin levels varied depending on crab species. In summary, these findings improve the understanding of crustacean allergens and contribute to the clinical diagnosis of crustacean allergies.

AB Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis of the main components of liquorice was performed and a novel strong mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) agonist, namely liquiritinapioside (LA), whose the binding constant was 1.093 x 10(-5) M, was reported. As a supplement, LA has been further demonstrated to have a strong MR binding capacity through competitive binding experiments (the enrichment factor of LA was 10.22%). This study also validated the activity of LA on H9c2 cells. The expression of collagen I and the results of Masson staining were used to determine the ability of this substance to cause H9c2 cell fibrosis. Moreover, western blotting was used to verify the mechanism of compound-induced myocardial fibrosis. Overall, the attained results showed that LA could induce the activation of the TGF-beta 1/p38 MAPK signalling pathway through the MR to induce H9c2 cell fibrosis.

AB To avoid chilling injury (CI) of nectarines during storage, the impact of near-freezing temperature (NFT) (-1.4 +/- 0.1 degrees C), 0 +/- 0.1 degrees C and 5 +/- 0.1 degrees C on CI incidence, ion leakage, levels of soluble sugars and enzymatic activities related to soluble sugars and energy metabolism, were investigated over five weeks. NFT-stored fruit showed no CI symptoms and significantly (P < 0.05) lower increase of ion leakage than those kept at 0 and 5 degrees C. NFT significantly (P < 0.05) diminished the activities of sucrose metabolism-associated enzymes leading to a higher level of sucrose in fruit, and maintained higher activities of hexokinase and fructokinase. Additionally, NFT-stored fruit exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) higher activities of energy metabolism-associated enzymes than fruit stored at 0 and 5 degrees C, leading to high levels of adenosine triphosphate and energy in fruit. These results indicated that NFT storage can effectively enhance chilling tolerance of nectarine fruit by inducing the metabolism of soluble carbohydrates and energy.

AB Citric acid, glycerol, and D-sorbitol are used as important food additives. In this research work, viscosities and refractive indices (the physico-chemical properties) for aqueous solution of citric acid, as well as ternary solutions of (water + D-sorbitol + citric acid) and (water + glycerol + citric acid) were measured in mass fractions of citric acid (0.03-0.21) and at temperatures (T = 293.15, 303.15, 313.15, and 323.15) K and atmospheric pressure. For these solutions, the experimental refractive indices were fitted using a semi-empirical equation which its constant, K-r, was introduced by Koohyar in 2011. This constant can be applied to investigate the power of interactions between solute and solvent molecules in aqueous solutions. Also, the experimental viscosities were fitted by the Jones-Dole and Arrhenius-like equations. Obtained data of this research work can be applied in food industries.

AB Kefiran-carboxymethyl cellulose biocomposite films incorporated with Satureja Khuzestanica essential oil were developed and characterized. Results indicated that increase in the concentration of the essential oil increased ultimate tensile strength and contact angle but decreased elongation at break, moisture content and water vapor permeability. It also significantly altered color parameters and the percentage of light transmission in the visible and ultraviolet range. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed the formation of hydrogen bonds between polymer matrix and essential oil. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the surface structure of the films was homogeneous without porosity. Increase in storage modulus and glass transmission temperature in films incorporated with the essential oil was observed through dynamic mechanical thermal analysis. Moreover, significant increase in antioxidant properties and phenolic compounds were noticed. Ultimately, results obtained from evaluation of antimicrobial characteristics of films indicated their inhibitory effects against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli bacteria.

AB Carrot residues were upgraded as pectin-enriched fractions (PEFs) useful for functional food formulation due to co-extracted antioxidants (alpha- and beta-carotenes, lutein, alpha-tocopherol), and gelling effect. High power ultrasound (US)-enzyme assisted extraction was applied for efficiency and sustainability. Carrot powder (CP) in citrate-buffer (pH 5.20) was submitted to US-pretreatment (12.27 W/cm(2): 20 kHz, 80% amplitude, 20 min) and a subsequent digestion (5 h-40 degrees C) without or with hemicellulase or cellulase. US-hemicellulase led to the highest PEF yield (27.1%), and extracted almost the whole pectin content of CP. US-pretreatment increased the extraction yield of all PEFs, but the existence of an additional positive effect of the following step depended on the enzyme used. PEFs contained 40-47% of UA with low DM (24-49.9%), and co-extracted antioxidants. US decreased the antioxidant contents, DM, and molecular weight, but allowed obtaining calcium crosslinked true gels, also with higher elastic modulus than non-US-extracted PEFs, being promising as food additives.

AB Head-space (HS) gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) is proposed for the assessment of the contamination of mayonnaise as an alternative to plate counting, which is the technique commonly used for evaluating microbial contamination. More specifically, this method was applied in the detection of Candida metapsilosis and Zygosaccharomyces bailii, both of great importance in term of food spoilage since they are resistant to many of the common methods of food preservation. Different chemometric models were investigated using the data obtained by GC-MS (m/z profile, area of the chromatographic peaks and entire chromatographic profile), in order to obtain the highest classification success. The best results were obtained using the chromatographic profile (success rate of 92%). Contaminated samples could also be classified according to the concentration of yeast, obtaining a success rate of 87.5%. Finally, a chemometric model was constructed in an attempt to differentiate between strains.

AB Whey is a byproduct with nutritional value and high organic and saline content. It is an important source of organic contamination in dairy industry. In this paper, we gave an overview of the current use of membrane materials and membrane processing in cheese whey protein recovery and discussed recent developments in membrane technology. Different types of membranes, such as polymers, ceramic membranes and modification membranes, are used for various purposes, such an increasing permeation flux, reducing membrane fouling, and increasing the protein rejection rate, concentration, fractionation and purification of whey protein. New membrane processing methods and integrated membrane methods to recover whey protein were reviewed. Membrane fouling factors during whey protein ultrafiltration process, which included whey protein conformation, membrane filtration conditions and the interaction between proteins and the membrane surface or pores, were also discussed and analyzed to reveal membrane fouling mechanism.

AB Electronic nose (E-nose), electronic tongue (E-tongue) and electronic eye (E-eye) combined with chemometrics methods were applied for qualitative identification and quantitative prediction of tea quality. Main chemical components, such as amino acids, catechins, polyphenols and caffeine were measured by traditional methods. Feature-level fusion strategy for the integration of the signals was introduced to integrate the E-nose, E-tongue and E-eye signals, aiming at improving the performances of identification and prediction models. Perfect results with an accuracy of 100% were obtained for qualitative identification of tea quality grades, based on fusion signals by support vector machine and random forest. Quantitative models were established for predicting the contents of the chemical components based on independent electronic signals and fusion signals by partial least squares regression, support vector machine and random forest. Random forest based on the fusion signals achieved the best performance in predicting the concentration of those chemical components.

AB This study investigated the effects of modified phosphatidylcholine (PC) with different alkyl chain lengths (PC_C14 and PC_C16) and covalently attached caffeic acid on the physical and oxidative stability of 70% fish oil-in-water emulsions. High fat emulsions were produced using different amounts of modified PCs in combination with sodium caseinate and soy-PC. Results showed that the physical stability of the emulsions was improved with increasing concentrations of modified PCs, due to their high surface activity. Emulsion stabilized with PC_C14 led to smaller droplets and higher viscosity, whereas PC_C16 had higher protein surface load, which may result in a thicker interfacial layer. Modified PCs enhanced the oxidative stability of the emulsions due to the attachment of caffeic acid to the glycerol backbone of PC, which brings the antioxidant in the vicinity of oil-water interface. PC_C16 led to less formation of primary and secondary oxidation products compared to PC_14 at their equivalent concentrations.

AB The aim of current investigation was to perform proteomics and physio-chemical studies to dissect the changes in contrasting varieties (S-22 and PKM-1) of Lycopersicon esculentum under low-temperature stress. Plant grown under variable low-temperature stress were analysed for their growth biomarkers, antioxidant enzyme activities, and other physiological parameters, which headed toward the determination of protein species responding to low-temperature and 24-epibrassinolide (EBL) concentrations. The plants grown under temperatures, 20/14, 12/7, and 10/3 degrees C recorded significantly lower growth biomarkers, SPAD chlorophyll, net photosynthetic rate and carbonic anhydrase activity in S-22 and PKM-1. Moreover, the combined effect of EBL and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) significantly improved the parameters mentioned above and consecutively upgraded the different antioxidant enzymes (CAT and SOD) with higher accumulation of proline under stress and stress-free environments. Furthermore, proteomics study revealed that the maximum number of differentially expressed proteins were detected in S-22 (EBL + H2O2); while treatment with EBL + H2O2 + low temperature lost expression of 20 proteins. Overall, three proteins (080577, Q9FJQ8, and Q9SKL2) took a substantial part in the biosynthesis of citrate cycle pathway and enhanced the growth and photosynthetic efficiency of tomato plants under low-temperature stress.

AB Ripening heterogeneity of Hass avocados results in inconsistent quality fruit delivered to the triggered and ready to eat markets. This research aimed to understand the effect of a heat shock (HS) prior to controlled atmosphere (CA) storage on the reduction of ripening heterogeneity. HS prior to CA storage reduces more drastically the ripening heterogeneity in middle season fruit. Via correlation network analysis we show the different metabolomics networks between HS and CA. High throughput proteomics revealed 135 differentially expressed proteins unique to middle season fruit triggered by HS. Further integration of metabolomics and proteomics data revealed that HS reduced the glycolytic throughput and induced protein degradation to deliver energy for the alternative ripening pathways. L-isoleucine,L-valine, L-aspartic and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase involved in protein degradation were positively correlated to HS samples. Our study provides new insights into the effectiveness of HS in synchronizing ripening of Hass avocados.

AB Product traceability provides important information for reinforcing hops quality and safety. In this study, multi-metal fingerprinting was used to establish an identification model for classifying hops' geographical origins and varieties. Twenty-two metals derived from hops were analyzed, which were grouped into major, minor, and trace elements. Analysis of variance showed the preliminary relationships between the metals and samples. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed essential differences among the different hops samples. Principal component analysis reduced 22 variables to two principal components, which identified the varieties and geographical origins of hops. Pearson correlation analysis was used to study the relationships between metals and functional ingredients. Furthermore, hops samples collected from non-main production area were used to verify the experimental model. Our approach can be used for effectively and accurately distinguishing hops based on variety and the geographical origin.

AB The Ca-doped carbon dots (CDca) exhibited strong catalysis of HAuCl4-H2O2 reaction to produce gold nanoparticle (AuNP), using Vitoria blue 4R (VB4r) as molecular probe, it appeared a strong surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) peak at 1615 cm(-1) in the AuNP nanosol substrate. When catalyst CDca increased, the SEAS peak enhanced linearly owing to AuNPs increasing, that is, the AuNP concentration is linear to SEAS signal. Potassium pyroantimonate (PA) ligand can adsorb on CDca surface to inhibit the catalysis and cause the SEAS peak decreasing. The analyte of Na+ reacts with PA to produce the stable precipitate of [Na-2(PA)] and free CDca catalyst. The more Na+, the more CDca released, and the stronger SEAS signal due to more AuNP substrate. Accordingly, a SEAS quantitative analysis method for Na+ was developed based on CDca catalytic SEAS reaction, with a linear range of 0.004-0.043 mu mol/L, and a detection limit of 0.0019 mu mol/L Na.

AB To investigate the influence of radio frequency (RF) stabilization treatment on rice bran protein isolate (RBPI) properties, functional, structural and thermal behaviors of RBPI obtained from RF treated RB were evaluated under various temperatures between 80 and 120 degrees C holding for 5 min. The results showed that RF heating had negative impact on the yield, purity, foaming properties and solubility of RBPI when the treatment temperature was higher than 100 degrees C, while the absorption and emulsifying properties were improved. No significant changes were observed in primary structure of RF treated samples, but the second structure changed with an increase in random coil and a decrease in beta-sheet, alpha-helix and beta-turn. The decreased tryptophan fluorescence and increased surface hydrophobicity suggested alterations in tertiary structure. RF treatment also caused noticeable decrease in denaturation temperature and enthalpy of RBPI. The results would provide basic information for food applications of proteins isolated from RF stabilized RB.

AB Chemical compositions of mushrooms are greatly dependent on the geographical region, and also the different parts of the same mushroom have different chemical constitutions. Several chemical methods are employed for quality control of mushrooms. However, these methods are destructive, require skilled personnel and are time consuming. To overcome these limitations researchers are aiming for vibrational spectroscopic techniques. This review is focused on various studies related to the application of vibrational spectroscopy for classification, authentication and quality analysis of mushrooms. It was concluded that vibrational spectroscopy could be efficiently employed for assessing the quality, authenticity and geographical origin of the mushrooms. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy were the most explored, whereas, Raman spectroscopy is the least explored technique in this field. Compact and cost-effective spectrometers based on the selective wavelengths have to be designed and installed at commercial and industrial level for rapid quality control of mushrooms.

AB Sao Francisco River Valley (SFRV) is a wine-producing semi-arid region in Brazil. Therefore, we used a H-1 NMR and UPLC-MS-based metabolomic approach coupled to chemometrics to evaluate the variability in Chenin Blanc and Syrah wines for two harvest seasons, two vine training system and six rootstocks. Overall, the secondary metabolites were influenced by the three factors studied, whereas the primary metabolites were only by the seasonally. Chenin Blanc wines made in December presented higher content of an unidentified carbohydrate. In Syrah wines, glycerol, tartaric acid, succinic acid and 2,3-butanediol were greater in December, while proline and lactic acid were more abundant in July. For training system, caffeic acid derivatives were increased in wines produced from espalier. Lyre system increased phenolic compounds, organic acids and apocarotenoids. The effect of the rootstocks was less pronounced, affecting basically caffeic acid derivatives. Thus, we expect that our results may assist the winemakers to improve the SFRV wine quality.

AB In this work, a facile approach was developed to synthesized alcalase-inorganic hybrid nanocomposite (alcalase@CaHPO4) by immobilizing alcalase with calcium hydrogen phosphate (CaHPO4). The nanocomposite possessed flower-like morphological features with excellent hydrolysis activity on soybean protein isolates (SPI) with 1.57 fold higher compared to free alcalase. The experiment was evident of alcalase@CaHPO4 hybrid nanoflowers with 90% sustainability after the seven cycles of reusability and 80-100% relative activity at 50-70 degrees C and with 65% at pH 4 in acidic condition. Soybean protein hydrolysates (SPHs) produced by immobilized alcalase possessed 70% radical-scavenging capacity at 0.8 mg/mL concentration and 20% calcium-binding capacity at pH 6. The solubility of SPHs produced by alcalase@CaHPO4 hybrid nanoflowers was also improved by 15% compared to free alcalase. The high radical scavenging capability, good calcium binding capacity and improved solubility of SPHs prepared through alcalase@CaHPO4 hybrid nanoflowers would be highly promising in food industries.

AB In the Mediterranean area, being pedoclimatic conditions more favorable to durum than common wheat cultivation, a bread-making tradition from durum wheat has been established. Durum wheat bread has a compact texture, with lower specific volume than common wheat bread. Due to health implications, several studies were carried out to reduce the content of NaCl in common wheat bread, however without considering durum wheat bread. The aim of this work was to assess the effect of salt reduction on quality and acceptability of durum wheat bread, with regard to specific volume, sensory features and aroma profile. Breads prepared with 5, 10, 15, 20 g/kg NaCl were submitted to consumer test. Control bread (20 g/kg salt) was the most appreciated, followed (greater than80% consumers) by bread with 10 g/kg salt, which showed a significantly (p < 0.05) higher specific volume, but lighter crust and weaker aroma (lower amounts of Maillard reaction products and fusel alcohols).

AB This study aimed to isolate starch from three types of untreated and autoclaved pulse seeds including chickpea, navy bean, and yellow field pea and to characterize their multi-scale structure and the associated physicochemical properties. Autoclaving of pulse seeds tended to significantly decrease the relative crystallinity, the M-w value, and degree of order of starch samples measured by X-ray diffraction, size exclusion chromatography, and FT-IR. Simultaneously, double helix content, and degree of double helix obtained from solid-state (CNMR)-C-13 and FT-IR were relatively higher (P < 0.05) for autoclaved pulse seeds than their native counterparts. The structural characteristics also corroborated well with the obtained results of resistant starch content, gelatinization behavior, swelling power, solubility, and bile acid binding capacity. This research gave insights into the structural characteristics of starch from pulses and their changes that occurred following processing of seeds, aiming to provide information for the future study on their processing-structure-function relationship.

AB The wide range of geographical cocoa production areas and the increasing consumption trend towards single origin products induced the necessity to verify and certify cocoa beans origin for quality assurance purposes. In this study cocoa beans of various origins were examined by machine olfaction and machine vision techniques. Fifty-nine fermented and dried Forastero cocoa beans from 23 different geographical origins (Africa, Americas, Southeast Asia) were investigated using Proton Transfer Reaction-Quadrupole interface-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry and Hyperspectral Imaging to elucidate the geographical information in the beans. The volatile and spectral fingerprints showed the same tendency in clustering samples from Africa separate from those from the Americas. High variability was observed for the Southeast Asian samples, which is most likely related to differences in fermentation. Machine olfaction and machine vision characterization provided a similar degree of separation but are complementary rapid techniques, which may be further developed for use in practical settings.

AB Starch in cooked rice affects the volatilization of aroma compounds, due to their interactions. In particular, the linear fraction of starch from various plant sources, i.e. amylose, can form complexes with a wide variety of ligands. In the present work, the capacity of amylose for embedding and controlling the release of five aroma compounds (hexanal, 1-octen-3-ol, gamma-decalactone, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, 2,3-butanedione), corresponding to the different types of typical aromas in cooked rice, were tested to determine whether they formed complexes with amylose. The results obtained from x-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry showed that the interactions occurred between amylose and aromas, and four of the aromas (except for 2,3-butanedione) could form complexes with V-type crystal. The release behavior of aromas from complexes was further evaluated using gas chromatography, indicating that amylose has effects on aroma release. These findings suggested that interactions between rice amylose and aromas occurred, thus affecting the release of aromas from the amylose matrix.

AB The effect of alkali concentration on the digestibility and absorption characteristics of rice residue protein isolates (RPI) and lysinoalanine (LAL) was studied. When NaOH concentration was 0.03 M, the in vitro digestibility of RPI reached a maximum, and when NaOH concentration was higher than 0.03 M, the in vitro digestibility decreased. Alkali treatment reduced the release of all amino acids, especially arginine, lysine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, cysteine, and threonine. LAL only released 2.65-9.28% of the total LAL content, which was mainly combined with longer peptide chains, and the molecular weight was mostly accumulated between 1000 Da and 3000 Da. The experimental model of rats in the small intestine perfusion showed that the high alkali concentration significantly reduced the absorption rate of RPI, and LAL had no specific absorption site in the small intestine of rats, and was not available for intestinal absorption.

AB The quality of cooked rice and its influence factors have always been the focus of researches. However, the formative mechanisms of its eating quality and structural changes of rice during cooking have seldom been evaluated. In this study, sectional real-time cooking was performed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic viscoelasticity analysis to monitor the phase transitions and mechanical changes of kernels, which exhibited different characteristics in different stages. Both glass transition and pasting behavior were captured, and showed more viscoelasticity of cooked rice at higher soaking temperatures. Meanwhile, the enzyme activity of rice during soaking was successfully measured by a rapid viscosity analyzer (RVA). Along with the differences of morphologies and crystalline structure at different soaking conditions, the findings of DSC and rheometer were further verified. This study provides effective methods to evaluate changes in rice during cooking and explains the mechanism of differences formed by the soaking temperature.

AB Actinidia deliciosa and A. arguta fruits (kiwifruit and kiwiberry, respectively) are an excellent source of bioactive compounds. The aim of this paper is to valorize the fruits that are not commercialized (e.g. due to inadequate size or physical damage) in infusions and decoctions. The antioxidant activity, the scavenging activity against reactive species, the phenolic profile and the intestinal effects of infusions and decoctions of dehydrated fruits were evaluated and compared. Decoctions presented the highest antioxidant activity and a good ability to capture HOCl and (NO)-N-center dot. The phenolic composition of A. arguta present quinic acid, cis-caftaric acid and its derivatives, caffeoyl hexoside, luteolin glucuronide, quercetin derivatives and myristin, while A. deliciosa extracts were characterized by the presence of quinic acid, caffeic acid and its derivatives and caffeoyl hexoside. No adverse effects were observed on Caco-2 and HT29-MTX cells. Kiwiberry decoctions showed to be the best option to keep the fruits benefits.

AB Polyphenols and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) accumulate during seed germination, but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to elucidate the accumulation of these bioactive compounds in Chinese wild rice during germination. The greatest differences in the phenolic content were at 36-h (G36) and 120-h germination (G120) stages. An iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis revealed 7031 proteins, and a comparison of the G120 and G36 stages revealed 956 upregulated and 188 downregulated proteins. The KEGG analysis revealed significant protein enrichment in the "metabolic pathways", "biosynthesis of secondary metabolites" and "phenylpropanoid biosynthesis". Four phenylalanine ammonia-lyases, one 4-coumarate-CoA ligase, one cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, two cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenases, and four glutamate decarboxylases exhibited higher expression at the G120 than at the G36 stage and promoted phenolics and GABA accumulation. This study revealed bioactive compound accumulation in germinating Chinese wild rice, and the finding may help develop functional foods derived from this cereal.

AB We investigated the dynamic changes in norisoprenoids and phenylalanine derivatives in off-vine Vidal blanc. Glycosidically bound as well as free-form volatile compounds were identified by GC-MS in two vintages. Thus, off-vine grape exhibited the development of four higher alcohols (viz. linalool oxide, 2-octanol, 1-pentanol, and 1-heptanol), C13-norisoprenoids (alpha-ionone), phenylalanine-derivates (2-phenylethanol), whereas beta-ionone and geranial showed high correlation in on-vine grape. Freeze-thaw cycles and desiccation, two exterior stress affect volatile compound development, resulted in content fluctuations during late harvest. Interestingly, the total content of higher alcohols was higher in on-vine grapes than off-vine grapes in two vintages respectively. Interestingly, the content of higher alcohols was higher in off-vine samples in the 2016 and 2017 vintages. In terms of physicochemical parameters, off-vine Vidal showed results similar to those of on-vine sample. Nevertheless, sensorial impression of the grape juice was influenced by interaction of vintages and vine treatments.

AB Polyphenol oxidase from Granny Smith apples was purified and characterized in both its soluble form (sPPO) and its membrane-bound form (mPPO). Both forms were purified by temperature-induced phase partitioning, precipitation with ammonium sulfate, and ion exchange chromatography. The specific activity of mPPO was 19.17 times that of sPPO. The optimum pH and temperature for both forms were 7.0 and 35 degrees C when catechol was the substrate. The Michaelis constant and maximum reaction rate for sPPO were 34.1 mM and 500 U/mL/min, whereas those for mPPO were 53 mM and 10,000 U/mL/min, respectively. The enzymes exhibited diphenolase activity, and their affinity was highest for catechol (sPPO) and 4-methylcatechol (mPPO). Inhibitors of sPPO and mPPO included ascorbic acid, glutathione, and L-cysteine. However, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid increased the activity of mPPO. Purified sPPO was dimeric with a molecular weight of 31 kDa, whereas mPPO was monomeric with an estimated molecular weight of 65 kDa.

AB Vitamin D nanoemulsions were fabricated using ultrasonic homogenization approach. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the preparation conditions for mixed surfactants (Soya lecithin and Tween 80; 2:3) based nanoemulsions. The effects of homogenization time (3.5-6.5 min), surfactant to oil ratio (0.43-0.78) and disperse phase volume (7-9%) on response variables were studied. Response Surface Methodology analysis results depicted that the polynomial model (second-order) can be used to predict response values. The coefficients of determinations were more than 0.90 for each response. The optimum emulsifying conditions for vitamin D nanoemulsions were 4.35 min homogenization time, 0.62 surfactant to oil ratio (S/O) and 7% disperse phase volume (DPV). Whereas, the experimental values for droplet size, droplet growth ratio (DGR) and vitamin D retention were 112.36 +/- 3.6 nm, 0.141 +/- 0.07 and 76.65 +/- 1.7% respectively. This research will be useful for the food and pharmaceutical industry to develop soya lecithin and Tween 80 based vitamin D delivery system for food additives and nutraceutical components.

AB Prolonged dietary exposure to AA-contaminated food crops cultivated in contaminated farmland was shown to be one of the main culprits of Balkan endemic nephropathy. Ultra-sensitive methods for the detection of AA at trace levels are important for surveillance purposes. We report the development of a novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for AA-detection. One striking feature of the method is that the Zn/H+-induced nitroreduction convert AA into their respective aristolactams, which dramatically enhances their analytical sensitivity. The method was applied to quantitate AA in food grains and soil samples collected from farming villages of Serbia, and flour samples purchased from supermarkets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of detecting AA in food ingredients available in supermarkets, which is alarming because it reveals AA poses insidious threats not only to residents of rural farming villages, but also to people residing in urban areas.

AB The effects of roasting, boiling, and freeze-drying after boiling on volatile aroma compounds in three varieties of Chinese foxtail millet (Setaria italica), namely, Jingu 21, Fenghonggu and Dongfangliang were determined. During boiling significant (p < 0.05) increases in the contents of several unsaturated aldehydes, alcohols, and benzene derivatives were observed, unlike roasting that mainly increased in the contents of pyrazines. Freeze-drying after boiling decreased complexity of flavors, with a reduction in the contents of volatile compounds. Descriptive sensory analysis showed that the maximum intensity of 'popcorn-like' and 'smoky' odors was observed for roasted samples, whereas boiled and pre-boiled-freeze-dried samples were characterized by 'boiled rice' and 'boiled potatoes' odors, respectively. A correlation of odor-active profile data with descriptive sensory analysis clearly established the role of pyrazines such as 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazine in contributing to the 'popcorn-like', 'boiled beans', and 'smoky' odors, whereas dienals such as (E,E)-2,4-decadienal were responsible for the 'boiled rice' aroma.

AB The major allergen of chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) roe is the beta'-component (Onc k 5, beta'-c), which is a yolk protein and a fragment of vitellogenin. When yolk content containing beta'-c was orally administered to mice, beta'-c passed through the gastrointestinal tract and was excreted in feces without marked degradation. The direct administration of beta'-c to ligated jejunal and ileal loops showed that beta'-c was absorbed through the small intestine and transferred into the blood. Immunohistochemical staining showed that orally administered beta'-c was distributed from the apical side to the basal side of intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting that endocytosis may be involved in the intestinal absorption of beta'-c .In conclusion, beta'-c is absorbed along a large portion of the small intestine and circulates in the blood stream without significant digestion. The resistance of beta'-c to gastro-intestinal digestion seems to contribute to its strong allergenicity.

AB A simple modification method was developed for the functionalization of amino terminated carbon nanotubes (CNT-NH2) by using isocyanates as modifiers via the nucleophilic addition reaction. Two types of functionalized magnetic carbon nanotubes (MCNT) were prepared through deposition of magnetic nanoparticles on CNT-NH2 and modification with different isocyanates. p-Tolyl-functionalized MCNT (Tol-MCNT) with better adsorption performance were selected as adsorbent for magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE), which could extract sulfonamides (SAs) from various milk samples with a enrichment factor of about 30 after optimization. By combining the MSPE with liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS), a new method was developed. Both skimmed and whole milk samples of three brands were analyzed with this method, and 4 SAs including sulfadiazine, sulfisomidine, sulfamethazine and sulfameter were detected with the concentration from unquantifiable to 72 ng/L, which were all well below the maximum residue limits in milk according to the regulations of China and EU.

AB Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) is considered one of the most common cause of human gastroenteritis. Aiming to detect C. jejuni in food products rapidly and sensitively, a dual mode lateral flow assay, based on the peroxidase mimicking and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhancement properties of platinum coated gold nanorods (AuNR@Pt), was developed in this study. Under color mode and SERS mode, the proposed assay showed good linear response in the range of 10(2)-10(6) cfu/mL and 10(2)-5 x 10(6) cfu/mL with limits of detection of 75 cfu/mL and 50 cfu/mL, respectively (S/N = 3). Furthermore, the reliability of the dual-readout lateral flow assay (LFA) was successfully demonstrated by the application on milk samples, in which the recoveries ranged from 89.33% to 107.62%. Overall, the immunochromatographic assay developed in this work is promising and has good chance to be employed for sensitive detection of C. jejuni in food products.

AB The objective of this study was to assess the content of bioactive compounds, organic acids and antioxidant capacity of grape juices from Isabel Precoce, BRS Carmem, BRS Cora and IAC 138-22 Maximo varieties grown on the 'IAC 766' and 'IAC 572' rootstocks under tropical conditions in Brazil. In general, the color attributes of the Isabel Precoce' juice were inferior to those of the other juices due to their low anthocyanin content. In contrast, 'IAC 138-22 Maximo' juices showed the highest content of most individual anthocyanins, flavonols, trans-resveratrol and total phenolic compounds, and thus, higher antioxidant capacity. Except for 'BRS Carmem', all the juices presented higher sugar accumulation when 'IAC 766' was used. This rootstock also contributed to the accumulation of t-resveratrol and most of individual anthocyanins in the 'IAC 138-22 Maximo' juices. However, the monomeric anthocyanin content was higher in 'BRS Carmem' juices when IAC 572' rootstock was used.

AB Nutritional, phytochemical and antioxidant potential of wheat pasta was enhanced by incorporation of S. cumini pulp (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40%). Incorporation of fruit pulp remarkably elevated the antioxidant activity (5.76 +/- 0.02 to 10.20 +/- 0.01%), beta-carotene (1336 +/- 1.84 to 7624 +/- 1.57 mu g/100 g), total phenolic content (111.2 +/- 0.08 to 176.3 +/- 0.84 mg GAE/100 g), dietary fiber (7.08 +/- 0.01 to 16.6 +/- 0.03%) and ash content (0.59 +/- 0.01 to 2.96 +/- 0.10%). Though with addition of pulp, gruel loss was increased, but it was within acceptable limit i.e. below 10%. Cooking time and pasting temperature of pasta was increased with higher amount of pulp incorporation. Lightness (L*) and yellowness (b*) of the product were decreased with incremental incorporation of pulp while redness (a*) was increased. On the basis of physical, phytochemical and sensory parameters, pasta with 30% pulp was found to be most acceptable with the overall acceptability of (8.1 +/- 0.28).

AB Shell-loosening is of importance in facilitating shrimp peeling. In this study, enzyme and high pressure (HP) improved the shell-loosening at different degrees, which were observed as gaps by microscopy. The shell-loosening gap induced by an endoprotease with broad specificity (Endocut-03L, 53 mu m) was much higher than that induced by HP at 100 MPa (HP100, 12 mu m), followed by an endoprotease with high specificity (Tail21, 8 mu m), and HP at 600 MPa (HP600, 5 mu m). The degree of shell-loosening was found to be correlated to the extent of protein changes that were obtained by 2D gel electrophoresis. Shell-loosening due to HP100 and Endocut-03L was mainly caused by physical and enzymatic degradation of high molecular-weight proteins in shell and epidermis and subsequent loss of degradation products, disrupting the structure of muscle-shell connection. However, HP100 was less effective than Endocut-03L due to its stabilizing effect on the shell collagen, lowering its shell-loosening effect.

AB This study aimed to investigate the associations between phenolic composition of selected purple maize genotypes and their anti-inflammatory, anti-adipogenic and anti-diabetic properties in vitro. Anthocyanin-rich water extracts (PMWs) from 20 purple maize genotypes were evaluated in RAW 264.7 macrophages and 3T3-L1 adipocytes under different conditions. Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside (Pr3G), peonidin-3-O-glucoside (P3G) and corresponding acylated forms were major anthocyanins in PMW, accompanied by ten tentatively identified non-anthocyanin phenolics. Correlation studies showed that C3G, P3G, and derivatives, but not Pr3G and its acylated form contributed to the biological properties of PMW. Besides anthocyanins, quercetin, luteolin, and rutin were the dominant anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic components, in terms of down-regulating pro-inflammatory mediator production in inflamed macrophages and adipocytes, modulating diabetes-related key enzymes and improving insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant adipocytes. Quercetin and phenolic acids, especially vanillic acid and protocatechuic acid, were closely associated with anti-adipogenic properties of PMW via inhibition of the preadipocyte-adipocyte transition.

AB A bioelectronic tongue (bioET) based on combinations of enzymes (tyrosinase and glucose oxidase) and polypyrrole (Ppy) or polypyrrole/AuNP (Ppy/AuNP) composites was build up and applied to the analysis and discrimination of musts and wines. Voltammetric responses of the array of sensors demonstrated the effectiveness of polymers as electron mediators and the existence of favorable synergistic effects between Ppy and the AuNPs. Using Principal Component Analysis and Parallel Factor Analysis it was possible to discriminate musts according to the degrees Brix and TPI (Total Polyphenol Index), and wines according to the alcoholic degree and TPI. Partial Least Squares provided good correlations between the bioET output and traditional chemical parameters. Moreover, Support Vector Machines permitted to predict the TPI and the alcoholic degree of wines, from data provided by the bioET in the corresponding grapes. This result opens the possibility to predict wine characteristics from the beginning of the vinification process.

AB Diacetyl, an important flavor extensively used in the food industry, can be produced from the non-enzymatic oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-acetolactate in bacteria fermentation. In previous work, we obtained a strain of Bacillus sp. DL01-Delta alpha lsD with low diacetyl accumulation. The strain was engineered and optimized for improving the production of diacetyl in this study. First, deletion of the gene encoding phosphotransacetylase (pta), by homologous recombination with high temperature sensitive shuttle plasmid vector pKS1, led to a reduction of acetate and 130% increase of diacetyl production in B. sp. DL01-Delta alpha lsD-alpha pta. Then overexpression of alpha-acetolactate synthase (ALS) from B. subtilis 168 in B. sp. DL01-Delta alpha lsD-Delta pta resulted in efficient diacetyl production with a titer of 5.43 g/L. To further increase diacetyl production, single factor and orthogonal experimental data were used to predict the optimal fermentation conditions by Back Propagation neural network. Optimal value of K(L)a (Dissolved oxygen volume coefficient) was 12.4 h(-1) with fermentation parameters of aeration rate 0.66 vvm, agitation speed 179 rpm and temperature 35.7 degrees C. A titer of 11.18 g/L diacetyl, the highest reported diacetyl production, was achieved by fed-batch fermentation at the optimal condition using the metabolic engineered strain of B. sp. DL01-Delta alpha lsD-alpha pta-alpha ls(168). These results are of great importance as a new way for the efficient production of diacetyl by food-safety bacteria.

AB Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) is a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, but its ligand has not yet been identified. Little is known about the role of the COUP-TFII nuclear receptor in cancer cells. In this study, we mapped the cistrome of COUP-TFII in three different cancer cells, namely breast cancer cells (MCF-7), myelogenous leukaemia cells (K562) and liver cancer cells (HepG2) using publicly available ChIP-seq data. Our results show that COUP-TFII co-localises with master transcription factors (TFs) in a cell-specific manner such as estrogen receptor alpha in MCF-7, hepatocyte nuclear factor alpha in HepG2, and GATA-binding factor in K562, while the shared, non-specific COUP-TFII binding sites are co-occupied by CTCF. We identified chromatin environments for these COUP-TFII and master TF co-bound sites together with COUP-TFII and CTCF co-bound sites. Our results show that COUP-TFII and master TF co-bound sites are marked with active enhancer specific histone modifications (H3K27ac and H3K4me1), while COUP-TFII and CTCF co-bound sites reveal active promoter specific histone marks (H3K27ac and H3K4me3). These results describe the genomic context and role of COUP-TFII in the cell-type specific transcriptional programs. Furthermore, we report that the VEGFA gene regulated by shared COUP-TFII and CTCF co-bound regulatory elements is involved in long-range looping in a cell-type-independent manner. These findings provide a genomic insight into the regulation and angiogenic role of COUP-TFII.

AB Many recent epigenetic studies utilize the advantages of CRISPR/dCas9 based tools in linking certain epigenetic modification with gene expression regulation. Various multifactorial diseases often contain changed epigenetic signatures at many loci, so tools for simultaneously targeting different loci would significantly facilitate the understanding of disease pathogenesis. We tested different dCas9 orthologs (dCjCas9, dNmCas9, dSt1Cas9, dFnCas9, dSaCas9 and dSpCas9) in C-terminal fusion with DNMT3A effector domain to find candidates that potentiate effector domain to perform its function at the target site. We demonstrated that nuclear localization signals (NLS) at both termini of fusion constructs is crucial for both proper nuclear import of such large constructs as well as for maximization of targeted DNA methylation activity. We identified SpCas9, SaCas9 and CjCas9 as potential candidates for the fusion constructs. With further optimization of the SaCas9 ortholog, due to less complex PAM requirements in contrast to CjCas9, we showed that N-terminal fusion with DNMT3A (dSaCas9-DNMT3A) is optimal to exert targeted DNA methylation activity comparable to the dSpCas9-DNMT3A construct. N-terminal fusions showed better results for both Cas9 orthologs, SaCas9 and SpCas9, so it can be used as universal approach for linking different effector domains in order to obtain highly active fusions.

AB 2-Keto-L-gulonic acid (2-KLG) is the direct precursor of vitamin C in industrial synthesis. 2-KLG is mainly produced via the classical two-step fermentation route. In the two-step fermentation process, 2-KLG can be synthesized from L-sorbose by Ketogulonicigenium vulgare aided by Bacillus megaterium. There are five sorbose/sorbosone dehydrogenases (SSDHs), SSDA1, SSDA1-P, SSDA2, SSDA3 and SSDB, and two sorbosone dehydrogenases (SNDHs), glucose/sorbosone dehydrogenase (GSNDH) and sorbosone dehydrogenase (SNDH), in K. vulgare, which could play crucial roles in transforming L-sorbose or L-sorbosone to 2-KLG. However, confusion about the catalytic characteristics of the individual SSDHs and SNDHs makes construction of a recombinational strain for the purpose of enhancing 2-KLG production difficult. In this study, the five SSDHs and two SNDHs from K. vulgare WSH-001 were purified, and their optimal pH values and reaction temperatures, kinetic properties, thermostabilities, substrate spectra and effects of electron acceptors on their performances were systematically determined. Among these dehydrogenases, only SSDA1 and SSDA3 have high activity for catalyzing L-sorbose to 2-KLG directly. These data provide more clues for ways to achieve enhanced conversion of L-sorbose in K. vulgare, which could facilitate both the construction of a more efficient one-step fermentation 2-KLG producer and the reconstruction of a one-step fermentation process.

AB Plant oils are very valuable agricultural commodity. The manipulation of seed oil composition to deliver enhanced fatty acid compositions, which are appropriate for feed or fuel, has always been a main objective of metabolic engineers. The last two decennary have been noticeable by numerous significant events in genetic engineering for identification of different gene targets to improve oil yield in oilseed crops. Particularly, genetic engineering approaches have presented major breakthrough in elevating oil content in oilseed crops such as Brassica napus and soybean. Additionally, current research efforts to explore the possibilities to modify the genetic expression of key regulators of oil accumulation along with biochemical studies to elucidate lipid biosynthesis will establish protocols to develop transgenic oilseed crops along much improved oil content. In this review, we describe current distinct genetic engineering approaches investigated by researchers for ameliorating oil content and its nutritional quality. Moreover, we will also discuss some auspicious and innovative approaches and challenges for engineering oil content to yield oil at much higher rate in oilseed crops.

AB In this work, an automated downstream process for the purification and formulation of a recombinant protein was integrated at lab scale in a single chromatography unit. The purification chain consists of three bind-and-elute chromatography columns, a flow-through membrane chromatography step, and a final ultrafiltration-diafiltration (UFDF) step to concentrate and formulate the sample. An integrated downstream process increases productivity and decreases process time and hold-up volume. In addition, the automation of the process allows reducing the manual work and increases reproducibility. To integrate the downstream steps, all the intermediate tanks are removed, and the eluate of a column is loaded directly onto the next one. This makes it necessary to design the process in order to minimize the column volumes and the process time. A research software called Orbit was used to automate the purification process and implement a UFDF step in the chromatography unit. The whole downstream sequence was successfully implemented at lab scale, getting a pure concentrated and formulated product with a productivity of 1.09 mg mL(-1) h(-1), achieving a time reduction from almost two to one working day, while getting a similar yield and purity. Regarding the UFDF operation, the sample was concentrated 10 times, and 97% of the old buffer was exchanged by the formulation buffer with a sequential diafiltration.

AB (+)-Nootkatone is a natural ingredient that occurs in grapefruit and certain other plants and is responsible for the characteristic smell of grapefruit. Due to its versatile applications in the flavor and fragrance industry as well as its application in some medical uses it recruits the interests of academic research along with industrial biotechnology. In the current work we present the application of a novel short chain dehydrogenase from Bacillus megaterium in an in vivo whole-cell biocatalyst system for the conversion of the intermediate nootkatol into the industrially valuable (+)-nootkatone. The newly identified dehydrogenase converted nootkatol selectively and efficiently into the final product. The conversion ratio of about 100% was achieved within 40 min yielding about 44 mg/L (+)-nootkatone. Furthermore, the herein identified dehydrogenase provides a new tool to overcome the limitation of the two-step enzymatic biotechnological process for the production of (+)-nootkatone.

AB The thermoacidophilic Crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius is an important model organism for Archaea and genetic systems are well established. To date, the organism is routinely cultivated on complex media based on protein hydrolysates and no common defined medium is established. In this work we address this lack of a standardized defined medium and replaced the complex protein hydrolysate with sodium glutamate as primary substrate. Starting from an existing medium formulation we stepwise managed to improve the medium regarding formation of precipitates, buffer capacity, concentration of basal salts and trace elements, and optimized growth rates. The differences on the cellular level between the original medium and our new formulation, called VD Medium, were investigated by comparative gene expression analysis and significant differences were discussed. The final formulation of the VD Medium contains 1.75 g/L Na-glutamate, 3 g/L D-glucose and 0.5 g/L citric acid as carbon sources. Using the described medium for the cultivation of S. acidocaldarius DSM 639 in shake flasks yields 1.1 g/L dry cell weight (OD600 = 1.7) after a typical incubation time of 95 h with an overall biomass yield of 0.33 g(DCW/)g(substrate).

AB Using mathematical model and computer simulation to predict biological processes and optimize the target production is an important strategy for optimizing fermentation process. However, the inherent uncertainty of the kinetic model severely limits the predictive capability. In this study, optimize target production, such as productivity and yield of 1, 3-propanediol produced by Klebsiella pneumoniae using glycerol as substrate, the ensemble modeling approach was used to reduce the model's uncertainty for fermentation process as much as possible, and effectively improve its prediction performance. Firstly, through sensitivity analysis, the parameters having significant influence on the model were determined as the adjustable parameters for the ensemble modeling. After comparison, the appropriate threshold coefficient of the model error was determined, and the sampling method was used to generate as many equivalent parameter sets as possible. Each set of parameters was separately applied for the simulation, and all the predicted values were integrated for the weighted average. Therefore, the expected value of the prediction was obtained. Compared with the traditional simulation using single parameter set, the ensemble modeling method achieved the lower relative error between the prediction and the experimental value and the greatly improved model prediction performance. Moreover, the optimal productivity and yield of 1, 3-propanediol and the corresponding operating conditions were obtained, respectively. The ensemble modeling approach effectively compensates for the uncertainties of the model, making its prediction performance more practical, which is important for computer simulations to predict and guide the actual production process.

AB Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) is a conserved transcription factor involved in the expression of genes that are critical to inflammation and cell survival. Exposure to particular signals results in phosphorylation of NF-kappa B inhibitor proteins, which in turn allows NF-kappa B dimers to translocate to the nucleus and induce gene expression. Pathologic consequences of NF-kappa B activation are vast, mainly because of the pleiotropic roles that NF-kappa B-induced genes have on inflammation, cell proliferation and apoptosis. Thus, experimental models assessing NF-kappa B activation have direct screening applications for drug discovery. In this scenario, pathway-specific reporter cell systems become valuable tools to identify and elucidate the mechanism of action of novel compounds. Here, we describe the generation, characterization, and validation of human cancer epithelial reporter cell lines for functional studies of NF-kappa B activation by different pro-and anti-inflammatory mediators. Human lung (H460) and breast (T-47D) cancer cell lines were transfected with a pNF-kappa B-hrGFP plasmid which contains the GFP gene under the control of NF-kappa B binding elements. The pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha was able to activate the reporter systems in a concentration-response manner, correlating to the activation of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Finally, the reporter cell lines were validated using dexamethasone, a potent anti-inflammatory drug, a synthetic inhibitor of NF-kappa B (BAY 11-7082) and a new anti-cancer peptide (CIGB-552). We have established robust H460-NF-kappa B-hrGFP and T-47D-NF-kappa B-hrGFP reporter cell lines which represent a useful cancer model for primary screening and identification of compounds with anti-inflammatory activity.

AB From a large screening of microbial extracts for the discovery of proteasome modulating natural products, the fungal strain Cercospora sp. (CF-223709) was selected as the most promising for further investigation. Different liquid cultures of the strain were initially screened for their anti-oxidant activity (DPPH, ABTS) and for their cytotoxicity against the A2058, HepG2 and CCD25sk cell lines. A detailed chemical analysis and evaluation of the capacity to activate 26S-proteasome was followed for the most active extract. Three main polyketides were isolated and characterized by extensive analysis of NMR and HRMS spectra data as penialidine F (1), fulvic acid (2), and SB238569 (3). Fulvic acid showed the most significant anti-oxidant activity. Its IC50 value (8.16 mu M) against the ABTS radical resulted 3-fold lower than the standard trolox. Fulvic acid also demonstrated a significant effect on proteasome by enhancing the chymotrypsin-and caspase-like activities of the 26S proteasome of human fibroblasts by 71.43% and 37.5% at 1 mu M, respectively. Furthermore by scaling up the culture in a 30 L submerged bioreactor, Cercospora sp. produced up to 162.6 +/- 1.3 mg of fulvic acid/L. Our findings suggest that CF-223709 can be a promising source of proteasome activating natural compounds.

AB Protein purification is an indispensable step in diverse fields of biological research or production process. Conventional purification methods including the affinity purification or the usage of self-aggregating tags suffered from many drawbacks such as the complicated steps, high cost and low efficiency. Moreover, the fusion tag usually had negative effects on the activity of the target protein. To address the above issues, here we propose a novel protein purification method which needs simple operation steps, and this method is mediated by the combination of CipA protein and a mini-intein (Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 DnaB, Ssp DnaB), depending on the assembly function of CipA and the self-cleavage function of Ssp DnaB. To realize the purification, CipA-DnaB-eGFP protein was expressed and assembled into protein crystalline inclusions (PCIs) in E. coli. Then, only cell lysis, cleavage and centrifugation steps were required to purify eGFP. Purified eGFP was in the supernatant with a purity of over 90%. The cleavage efficiency and the yield of eGFP reached 51.96% and 13.99 +/- 0.88 mg/L fermentation broth, respectively. Furthermore, to broaden the application of this approach, three other proteins which were maltose binding protein (MBP), ketoisovalerate decarboxylase (Kivd) and alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhP) were purified with high cleavage efficiency. The purified Kivd and AdhP remained high specific activities. This work demonstrated an effective and convenient protein purification method.

AB Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder mainly affecting the cardiovascular, ocular and musculo-skeletal systems. FBN1 gene mutations lead to MFS and related connective tissue disorders. In this work we described clinical and molecular data of 26 unrelated individuals with suspected MFS who were referred for FBN1 mutation analysis. FBN1 gene sequencing was performed by next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing methods. We identified 23 causal or potentially causal (including variants of uncertain significance) FBN1 variants, seven of them was novel ((similar to)30%). About 30% of the cases were sporadic. FBN1 mutations were associated with MFS in the majority of the patients, in two cases with severe and early onset manifestation of the syndrome. Missense mutations were detected in 69.6% (16/23), the majority of them were located in one of the cbEGF motifs and (similar to)70% of them substituted conserved cystein residues. Small deletions/duplications were identified in 13% of the cases (3/23), while splice site variants were detected in 17.4% (4/23). In three unrelated patients a low frequency recurrent silent variant (c.3294C > T (p.Asp1098=) was identified. FBN1 mRNA analysis showed that the mutation does not lead to aberrant splicing, based on available data the mutation was classified as benign.

AB Objectives: Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is known to be involved in the innate immunity and inflammatory responses that plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD). This study aimed to examine the potential relationship of TLR4 polymorphisms and serum TLR4 protein levels and the risk of CAD in the ethnic Zhuang population of China.
   Methods: 1171 serum samples were collected from Zhuang patients, including 556 CAD cases (>= 50% luminal stenosis of any coronary vessel) and 615 normal healthy controls (subjects with no luminal stenosis in coronary arteries). Detection of TLR4 polymorphisms was by single base extension polymerase chain reaction (Snapshot PCR) and DNA sequencing (rs11536879A/G and rs11536889G/C) gene sequence in all subjects. Serum TLR4 protein concentrations was measured by ELISA.
   Results: There are significant differences in the allele and genotype frequencies of TLR4 gene rs11536889 between Chinese Zhuang CAD patients and controls, especially in the males. Male carriers of rs11536879 andrs11536889 variant alleles show an increased risk of CAD compared to non-carriers. Serum TLR4 protein levels of CAD patients are higher than controls and the levels tended to increase with the number of coronary artery lesions. Serum TLR4 protein levels of CAD patients showed no correlation with rs11536879 and rs11536889 polymorphisms.
   Conclusions: The rs11536879 and rs11536889 polymorphisms of TLR4 gene and serum TLR4 protein levels may contribute to the occurrence and development of CAD. However, the rs11536879 and rs11536889 poly-morphisms have no significant effects on the expression of serum TLR4 protein in Zhuang patients with CAD.

The development of next generation sequencing opens a new window in rapid diagnosis of such heterogeneous condition in medical genetics laboratories. Here, we present ADCK3; deL CD (229-230) mutation in an Iranian consanguineous family with three cerebellar ataxic boys using whole exome sequencing. The mutation was predicted pathogenic and all the affected individuals were homozygous for the variant. Although, the ADCK3 was previously reported as one of the master genes of ARSC, our mutation was novel as has been not previously reported in dbSNP or literature.

AB Introduction: Renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) remains one of the most diseases in clinic. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential role and mechanism of propofol in protecting mice kidney from IRI.
   Methods: Renal I/R model was established in C57/BL6 mice by clamping bilateral renal pedicles for 35 min. The mice were randomly divided into four groups: sham group, IR group, IR + Propofol group, and IR + Propofol +LY294002 group. Histological assessment of kidney was conducted by HE staining and the levels of serum creatinine (SCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of each group were measured. Expressions of inflammatory factors (IL-6, TNF-alpha) were detected by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting. The expression levels of cleaved Caspasse-3, PI3K, Akt, p-Akt, mTOR, and p-mTOR within renal tissue samples were measured by Western Blot.
   Results: The levels BUN, Cr and morphological damage score increased significantly after renal IRI. However, such changes could be prevented by propofol. Besides, IRI reduced renal expressions of PI3K, p-Akt, p-mTOR, and increased the levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, cl-caspase-3 in kidney, After propofol treatment, these changes were significantly alleviated, but the use of PBX inhibitor LY294002 could reverse the effects of propofol.
   Conclusion: Propofol can protect renal IRI partially by reducing apoptosis and release of inflammatory cytokines, which is possibly involved in the modulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Our data suggested that propofol may play certain positive roles in protecting the kidney from IRI.

AB GATA5 is a member of the GATA transcription factor family, which serves essential roles in varieties of cellular functions and biological processes. In this study, we have accomplished the molecular cloning, bioinformatic analysis and preliminary function study of C. semilaevis GATA5. The full-length cDNA nucleotide sequence is 1955 bp, with a coding sequence of 1167 bp, which encodes a polypeptide of 388 amino acids. Homology, phylogenetic, gene structure and synteny analysis showed that C. semilaevis GATA5 was highly conserved among vertebrates. Tissue distribution pattern exhibited that C. semilaevis GATA5 was significantly expressed in heart, intestine, liver, kidney and gonad, with a sexual dimorphic feature observed in testis and ovary. Embryonic development expression profiles showed that C. semilaevis GATA5 transcripts increased at the blastula stage, and peaked at the heat-beating period. Strong signals were detected at spermatids of male testis and stage III oocytes of female ovary by ISH. The expression of C. semilaevis GATA5 was regulated by 17 alpha-MT and E2 after hormone stimulation to the ovary. Together, all the results pointed out that GATA5 might play a vital role during gonadal maturation and the reproductive cycle of C. semilaevis. This study lays the foundation for further researches on the sex control breeding in tongue sole.

   The current study investigated the association of RAGE G82S polymorphism with chronic periodontitis in South Indians with and without type II Diabetes mellitus.
   Materials and methods: 405 individuals were enrolled into 3 groups-systemically and periodontally healthy with no attachment loss (n = 135), generalized chronic periodontitis (n = 135)and generalized chronic periodontitis with type II diabetes mellitus(n = 135). Periodontal clinical parameters were recorded. RFLP-PCR was utilized for genotyping.
   Results: Frequencies of genotype GG, GA and AA were 133, 2, 0 in group I respectively, 131, 4, 0 in group II respectively and 118, 13, 4 in group III respectively. Pearson's Chi squared test demonstrated a significant difference in the genotype distribution between the three groups (chi(2) = 19.88,P < 0.001). Fischer exact-test showed that the variant GA/AA genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk for generalized chronic periodontitis in type II diabetics when compared with the GG genotype of systemically and periodontally healthy subjects (OR-9.58, 95% CI 2.168-42.339, P < 0.001) and non-diabetic chronic periodontitis subjects (OR- 4.71, 95% CI: 1.54-14.42, P < 0.05). No association and increased susceptibility to chronic periodontitis was observed in subjects with GA/AA genotype when compared with systemically and periodontally healthy subjects (OR- 2.031, 95% CI: 0.366-11.277 P > 0.05). Furthermore, comparison of clinical parameters based on genotype distribution revealed statistically significant higher mean plaque (P < 0.05) and sulcus bleeding score (P < 0.001) in group-III subjects.
   Conclusion: RAGE G82S gene polymorphism confers susceptibility to generalized chronic periodontitis in type II diabetic subjects of South Indian Tamilian ethnicity.

AB Riboswitches are gene control elements that directly bind to specific ligands to regulate gene expression without the need for proteins. They are found in all three domains of life, including Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota. Riboswitches are mostly spread in bacteria and archaea. In this paper, we discuss the general distribution, structure, and function of 28 different riboswitch classes as we focus our attention on riboswitches in bacteria. Bacterial riboswitches regulate gene expression by four distinct mechanisms. They regulate the expression of a limited number of genes. However, most of these genes are responsible for the synthesis of essential metabolites without which the cell cannot function. Therefore, riboswitch distribution is also important for antibacterial drug development.

AB Forkhead box O1 (foxo1) is a transcription factor and plays important roles in glucose metabolism. In the present study, foxo1 in turbot Scophthalmus maximus was cloned and characterized. The siRNA of foxo1 was used to investigate the functions of foxo1 in turbot hepatocytes glucose metabolism. After that, a 10-week feeding trial with two different dietary carbohydrate levels (15% and 21%, respectively) was conducted to analyze the function of foxo1 in glucose metabolism in vivo. Results showed that the foxo1 was identified as 2176 bp (base pair) with a 2025 bp open reading frame, which encoded 675 amino acids. Sequence analysis showed that foxo1 of turbot was highly homologous to most of fishes. Tissue distribution analysis revealed that the highest expression of foxo1 was in liver. After in vitro analysis, foxo1-specific small interfering RNA (sifoxol) treatment significantly decreased the expressions of cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (cpepck) and glucose-6phosphatase1(g6pase1) in primary hepatocytes. Expression of mitochondria] phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (mpepck) was not significantly inhibited. In contrast, the expression of glucose-6-phosphatase2 (g6pase2) increased significantly. After the in vivo study (feeding trial), with the decreased expression of foxo1 in turbot due to high dietary carbohydrate level (21%), the expression of g6pase2 was significantly upregulated. However, the expression of glucokinase (gk) was not changed significantly. These increased the level of blood glucose and hepatic glycogen. In conclusion, data from both in vitro (primary hepatocytes) and in vivo (feeding trial) showed that downregulated foxo1 in turbot could not result in significant depression of gluconeogenesis and activation of glycolysis. This could be one of the reasons why intake of high level of carbohydrate resulted in prolonged hyperglycemia in turbot.

AB Zika virus (ZIKV) has spread globally and has been linked to the onset of microcephaly and other brain abnormalities. The ZIKV genome consists of an similar to 10.7 kb positive-stranded RNA molecule that encodes three structural (C, prM and E) and seven nonstructural (5'-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A/2K-NS4B-NS5-3') proteins. In this work, we looked for genetic variants in 485 ZIKV complete genomes from GenBank (NCBI) and performed a computational systematic approach using MAESTROweb server to assess the impact of nonsynonymous mutations in ZIKV proteins (C, M, E, NS1, NS2A, NS2B-NS3 protease, NS3 helicase and NS5). Then, we merged the data and correlated it with the phenotypic reports of ZIKV circulating strains. The sensitivity profile of the proteins showed 96 mutational hotspots. We found 22 relevant mutations in proteins C (180T), NS2A (I34M/T/V, I45V, I80T/V, L113F, A117V, I118V, L128P, V143A, T151A, M199I/V, R207K and L208I) and NS3 helicase (D436G, Y498H, R525K, Q528R and R583K) of the circulating strains. Our analysis exploited the impact of nonsynonymous mutations on ZIKV proteins, their structural and functional insights. The results presented here could advance our current understanding on ZIKV proteins functions and pathogenesis.

DE Rabies; Antivirals
ID FAVIPIRAVIR T-705; RNA
AB Rabies virus remains an important burden of disease claiming an estimated 60,000 lives each year, mainly children, and having a huge economical and societal cost. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is highly effective, however in patients that present with neurological symptoms the case-fatality ratio is extremely high (>99%). During the last decades several attempts to identify potent and effective antivirals were made. Only a few of these demonstrated improvement in clinical signs in animal studies and none of the trials in humans showed significant efficacy. Here we explore novel opportunities to identify more potent anti-rabies molecules. In particular important progress has been made on antivirals against other Mononegavirales (paramyxoviruses, filoviruses) which should be an impetus to test and optimize these molecules towards anti-rabies virus therapies. Effective rabies antivirals for therapeutic use need to be molecules that can be dosed into the cerebrospinal fluid and that rapidly and potently block ongoing virus replication and as such stop the further spread of the virus. Antivirals for prophylactic use can also be envisaged and these should be able to prevent infection of peripheral nerve cells and should have the potential to replace the current anti-rabies immunoglobulins that are used in PEP.

AB Five different compounds were tested for their in vitro inhibitory effect against RABV multiplication in mouse neuroblastoma (N2A) cell line. N2A cells were infected with the fixed RABV strain CVS-11 one hour prior to adding antivirals or their respective combinations. The infectious titre of RABV as well as the quantity of viral RNA was determined in the cell culturing medium after 48 h. All five tested compounds (mouse interferon (IFN)-alpha and -beta, ribavirin, favipiravir (T-705) and sorafenib) reduced viral replication in a concentration-dependent manner: IFN-beta and sorafenib both provided 73.71% relative inhibition of viral replication in the highest non-cytotoxic concentration, while ribavirin caused 48.07%, IFN-alpha caused 44.87% and favipiravir caused 35.25% relative inhibition, respectively. When applied in combination, their antiviral activity was not synergistic, but a pronounced inhibition was detected when IFN-beta was combined with sorafenib, ribavirin, or favipiravir. The highest antiviral effect was caused by the combination of IFN-beta and sorafenib (77.19% relative inhibition). In other combinations there was an antagonistic effect detected in the reduction of viral replication. The results demonstrate that these compounds can be promising candidates for a potential combination treatment of rabies, noting that some combinations are not favourable in vitro, which makes thorough in vivo studies necessary.

AB Rabies causes more than 60,000 human deaths annually in areas where the virus is endemic. Importantly, rabies is one of the few pathogens for which there is no treatment following the onset of clinical disease with the outcome of infection being death in almost 100% of cases. Whilst vaccination, and the combination of vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin treatment for post-exposure administration are available, no tools have been identified that can reduce or prevent rabies virus replication once clinical disease has initiated. The search for effective antiviral molecules to treat those that have already developed clinical disease associated with rabies virus infection is considered one of the most important goals in rabies research. The current study assesses a single chain antibody molecule (ScFv) based on a monoclonal antibody that potently neutralises rabies in vitro as a potential therapeutic candidate. The recombinant ScFv was generated in Nicotiana benthamiana by transient expression, and was chemically conjugated (ScFv/RVG) to a 29 amino acid peptide, specific for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) binding in the CNS. This conjugated molecule was able to bind nAchR in vitro and enter neuronal cells more efficiently than ScFv. The ability of the ScFv/RVG to neutralise virus in vivo was assessed using a staggered administration where the molecule was inoculated either four hours before, two days after or four days after infection. The ScFv/RVG conjugate was evaluated in direct comparison with HRIG and a potential antiviral molecule, Favipiravir (also known as T-705) to indicate whether there was greater bioavailability of the ScFv in the brains of treated mice. The study indicated that the approach taken with the ScFv/RVG conjugate may have utility in the design and implementation of novel tools targetting rabies virus infection in the brain.

AB Rabies virus infects almost all mammals resulting in lethal disease. To date there is no treatment available for symptomatic rabies and there is an urgent need to develop treatment strategies that would prolong survival, thereby providing a window of opportunity for the host to mount a protective immune response. We hypothesized that both virus and excessive immune response contribute to disease and that interfering with both is necessary to prevent lethal disease. Here, we have inhibited the pro-inflammatory response associated with pyroptosis and showed that inhibition of CASP-1 had a beneficial effect on survival time. Our results confirm that some inflammatory responses may be involved in the pathogenesis of severe disease and the results suggest that effective intervention includes inhibition of virus and host response.

AB There is no antiviral treatment available once clinical disease following rabies virus infection has initiated. Considered a neglected tropical disease, >60,000 human rabies deaths are estimated each year despite the availability of pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis for pre-immunisation or administration following a potential exposure before the onset of clinical disease. Such post-exposure treatments include administration of rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) and vaccination at a distant site to prime a humoral immune response. However, current therapeutic options are limited. Regardless there is a need for molecules that target virus infection following the onset of clinical disease where the outcome of infection is invariably fatal., Numerous molecules have been assessed as potential antivirals against rabies virus (RABV) but with little promise. Favipiravir (T-705) is a broad-spectrum RNA polymerase inhibitor, which has been shown to have antiviral activity against a range of RNA viruses including some against RABV. In the present study, the utility of T-705 has been reassessed in vitro as well as in vivo in a murine model using intraperitoneal administration to investigate any immune protective effect of the molecule. In vitro T-705 effectively reduces RABV replication. However, in vivo, following assessment of various applications of the molecule in both pre- and post-exposure scenarios, the effect was limited. T-705 treatment delayed the onset of clinical signs when virus was delivered intramuscularly at a higher dose (10(6.8) TCID50/ml) and reduced the number of mice that developed clinical signs when virus was delivered at a lower dose (10(5.8) TCID50/ml) during the observation period. The day at which treatment commenced did not appear to have a statistically significant effect on the results in either experiment. The use of T-705 as a single biological entity may be limited, however, further work is required to assess the synergistic effect of T-705 as a component of a multi-drug therapy for treating human rabies infections.

AB Over the last 20 years, natural peptides playing a key role in defense mechanisms and innate immunity have been isolated from unicellular organisms. Amphibian skin secretes dermaseptins, 24-34 amino acids in length that have a wide antimicrobial spectrum incorporating yeast, fungi, protozoa, bacteria and enveloped viruses. The anti-rabies virus (RABV) activity of dermaseptins S3 (30aa) and S4 (28aa) from Phyllomedusa sauvagei has been investigated, and further dissected its molecular basis by comparing punctual mutation or deletion of S4 analogues. The results showed that: (1) S4 is more active than S3 against RABV infection, 89% versus 38% inhibition at 7.5 mu M; (2) the 5 NH2-aa of S4 are crucial for its inhibitory potential (S4(6-28) lost any inhibition) but the COOH terminus stabilizes the inhibitory potential (S4(1-16) showed only 23% inhibition at 7.5 mu M); (3) there is a correlation between viral inhibition and dermaseptin cytotoxicity, which remains however moderated for BSR cells (<= 12% at 10 mu M). A single mutation in position 4 (S4(M4K)) slightly reduced cytotoxicity while keeping its antiviral activity, 97% at 7.5 mu M. S4 and S4(M4K )showed an antiviral activity in vitro when provided 1 h after infection. In vivo experiments in mice by intramuscular injection of non-toxic doses of dermaseptin S4(M4K) 1 h post-infection by a lethal dose of RABV at the same site allowed more than 50% improvement in mice survival. This study highlights the potential interest of dermaseptins as non-expansive alternatives to rabies immunoglobulins for the treatment of rabies that continues to claim about 60,000 human lives per year worldwide, almost exclusively in developing countries.

AB Rabies is a fatal disease of all mammals causing almost 60,000 human deaths every year. To date, there is no effective treatment of clinical rabies once the symptoms appear. Here, we describe the promising effect of combination therapy composed of molecules that target replication of the rabies virus (RV) at different stages of life cycle and molecules that inhibit some pathways of the innate host immune response accompanied by a blood-brain barrier opener on the outcome of RV infection. The study reports statistically significant extension of survival of mice treated with the drug cocktail containing T-705, ribavirin, interferon alpha/beta, caspase-1 inhibitor, TNF-alpha inhibitor, MAPKs inhibitor and HRIG compared to the survival of mice in the virus control group (p = 0.0312). Furthermore, the study points to the significant impact of interferon alpha/beta on the survival of RV-infected mice. We have shown a significant down regulation of pro-inflammatory molecules (caspase-1 and TNF-a) in the CNS in RV-infected mice treated with a combination of drugs including interferon alpha/beta.

AB Rabies is a deadly viral disease with an extremely high fatality rate in humans. Previously, it was suggested that an enhancement of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, which allows immune cells and/or antibodies to enter the central nervous system (CNS) tissue, is critical to clear the infection. In this study, we utilised mannitol to increase BBB permeability in mice infected with highly pathogenic silver-haired bat rabies virus (SHBRV). We found that intraperitoneal injection of mannitol causes a slight, transient increase of BBB permeability in the treated mice. SHBRV-infected mice were treated with intraperitoneally administered mannitol daily from day 3 or day 4 post-infection, but no effect of this treatment on the time of disease onset, clinical signs or survival was observed. This data indicates that the increase of BBB permeability by mannitol is not efficient in promoting CNS virus clearance in SHBRV-infected mice. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rabies is invariably fatal, when post-exposure prophylaxis is administered after the onset of clinical symptoms. In many countries, rabies awareness is very low and the availability of post-exposure prophylaxis, as recommended by WHO guidelines, is very limited or non-existent, probably as a consequence of high cost. Therefore, new concepts for rabies therapy are needed. Innate immune mechanisms involving the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, activated after rabies infection, are thought to be involved in the neuropathogenesis of rabies. These mechanisms can contribute to a detrimental host response to the rabies virus (RABV) infection. The use of inhibitors of cytokines/chemokines are supposed to extend the survival of a sick individual. Inhibitors of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and MAPKs were used in RABV inoculated mice to define their influence on the survival time of rabid mice. The study demonstrated that all inhibitors extended mice survival, but at different rates. A log-rank test confirmed the statistically significant survival of mice treated with TNF-alpha (p = .0087) and MAPKs inhibitors (p = .0024). A delay in the time of onset of rabies was also recorded, in mice given TNF-alpha and MAPKs inhibitors. The highest virus load was found in the spinal cord and the lowest in the cortex, regardless of the experimental group. Significant TNF-alpha (p <=.0001) and IL-6 (p <= .0001) gene upregulation was observed in mice, as a consequence of RABV infection. Regarding MAPK5 pathways, there was significant upregulation of the caspase 3 (p = .012, p = .0026) and Mcl-1 (p = .0348, p = .0153) genes, whereas significant downregulation of the cytochrome C (p <= .0001), Bcl2 (p = .0002, p = .0007) and JNK3 (p = .042) genes. Rabies pathogenesis is multifactorial, involving both virus and host influences on the course of the infection. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent studies demonstrated that inhibitors of pro-inflammatory molecular cascades triggered by rabies infection in the central nervous system (CNS) can enhance survival in mouse model and that certain antiviral compounds interfere with rabies virus replication in vitro. In this study different combinations of therapeutics were tested to evaluate their effect on survival in rabies-infected mice, as well as on viral load in the CNS. C57Bl/6 mice were infected with Silver-haired bat rabies virus (SHBRV)-18 at virus dose approaching LD50 and LD100. In one experimental group daily treatments were initiated 4 h before-, in other groups 48 or 96 h after challenge. In the first experiment therapeutic combination contained inhibitors of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (infliximab), caspase-1 (Ac-YVAD-cmk), and a multikinase inhibitor (sorafenib). In the treated groups there was a notable but not significant increase of survival compared to the virus infected, non-treated mice. The addition of human rabies immunoglobulins (HRIG) to the combination in the second experiment almost completely prevented mortality in the pre-exposure treatment group along with a significant reduction of viral titres in the CNS. Post-exposure treatments also greatly improved survival rates. As part of the combination with immunomodulatory compounds, HRIG had a higher impact on survival than alone. In the third experiment the combination was further supplemented with type-I interferons, ribavirin and favipiravir (T-705). As a blood-brain barrier opener, mannitol was also administered. This treatment was unable to prevent lethal consequences of SHBRV-18 infection; furthermore, it caused toxicity in treated mice, presumably due to interaction among the components. In all experiments, viral loads in the CNS were similar in mice that succumbed to rabies regardless of treatment. According to the findings, inhibitors of detrimental host response to rabies combined with antibodies can be considered among the possible therapeutic and post-exposure options in human rabies cases.

AB Rabies is a lethal disease in humans and animals, killing approximately 60,000 people every year. Currently, there is no treatment available, except post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) that can be administered whenever exposure to a rabid animal took place. Here we describe the beneficial effects of a combination treatment initiated at day 4 post infection, containing anti-viral drugs and immune modulators in infected mice. Combination therapy resulted in significant increase in survival time (P < 0.05) and significantly lowers viral RNA in the brain and spinal cord (P < 0.05). Furthermore, treatment influenced markers of pyroptosis and apoptosis and early inflammatory response as measured by the levels of TNF-alpha. Morphological lesions were absent in rabies virus infected mice with few signs of inflammation. However, these were not significant between the different groups. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB During the 20th century parenteral vaccination of dogs at central-point locations was the foundation of successful canine rabies elimination programs in numerous countries. However, countries that remain enzootic for canine rabies have lower infrastructural development compared to countries that have achieved elimination, which may make traditional vaccination methods less successful. Alternative vaccination methods for dogs must be considered, such as oral rabies vaccine (ORV). In 2016, a traditional mass dog vaccination campaign in Haiti was supplemented with ORV to improve vaccination coverage and to evaluate the use of ORV in dogs. Blisters containing live-attenuated, vaccine strain SPBNGAS-GAS were placed in intestine bait and distributed to dogs by hand. Serum was collected from 107 dogs, aged 3-12 months with no reported prior rabies vaccination, pre-vaccination and from 78/107 dogs (72.9%) 17 days post-vaccination. The rapid florescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) was used to detect neutralizing antibodies and an ELISA to detect rabies binding antibodies. Post-vaccination, 38/41 (92.7%) dogs that received parenteral vaccine had detectable antibody (REFIT >0.05 IU/mL), compared to 16/27 (59.3%, p < 0.01) dogs that received ORV or 21/27 (77.8%) as measured by ELISA (>40% blocking, p < 0.05). The fate of 291 oral vaccines was recorded; 283 dogs (97.2%) consumed the bait; 272 dogs (93.4%) were observed to puncture the blister, and only 14 blisters (4.8%) could not be retrieved by vaccinators and were potentially left in the environment. Pre-vaccination antibodies (RFFIT >0.05 IU/mL) were detected in 10/107 reportedly vaccine-naive dogs (9.3%). Parenteral vaccination remains the most reliable method for ensuring adequate immune response in dogs, however ORV represents a viable strategy to supplement existing parental vaccination campaigns in hard-to-reach dog populations. The hand-out model reduces the risk of unintended contact with ORV through minimizing vaccine blisters left in the community. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB To test the immunogenicity and efficacy of a new oral rabies virus vaccine strain SPBN GASGAS in wildlife target species, one group of foxes and two groups of raccoon dogs were offered a bait containing 1.7 ml of the vaccine (10(6.6) FFU/ml; 10(6.8) FFU/close) and subsequently challenged approximately 180 days later with a fox rabies virus isolate. One group of raccoon dogs (n = 30) received the same challenge dose (10(0.7) MICLD50/ml) as the red foxes (n = 29). The other group with raccoon dogs (n = 28) together with 8 animals that received the vaccine dose by direct instillation into the oral cavity (DIOC) were infected with a 40-fold higher dose of the challenge virus (10(2.3 )MICLD(50)/ml). All but one of the 29 vaccinated foxes survived the challenge infection; meanwhile all 12 control foxes succumbed to rabies. Twenty-eight of 30 vaccinated raccoon dogs challenged with the same dose survived the infection, however only six of 12 control animals succumbed. When the higher challenge dose was administered, all 12 control animals died from rabies and all 36 vaccinated animals (28 baited plus 8 DIOC) survived. Blood samples were collected at different time points post vaccination and examined by both RFFIT and ELISA. The kinetics of the measured immune response was similar for both species, although in RFFIT slightly higher values were observed in foxes than in raccoon dogs. However, the immune response as measured in ELISA was identical for both species. The oral rabies virus vaccine SPBN GASGAS meets the efficacy requirements for live rabies virus vaccines as laid down by the European Pharmacopoeia. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Live-attenuated rabies virus strains such as those derived from the field isolate Street Alabama Dufferin (SAD) have been used extensively and very effectively as oral rabies vaccines for the control of fox rabies in both Europe and Canada. Although these vaccines are safe, some cases of vaccine-derived rabies have been detected during rabies surveillance accompanying these campaigns. In recent analysis it was shown that some commercial SAD vaccines consist of diverse viral populations, rather than clonal genotypes. For cases of vaccine-derived rabies, only consensus sequence data have been available to date and information concerning their population diversity was thus lacking.
   In our study, we used high-throughput sequencing to analyze 11 cases of vaccine-derived rabies, and compared their viral population diversity to the related oral rabies vaccines using pairwise Manhattan distances. This extensive deep sequencing analysis of vaccine-derived rabies cases observed during oral vaccination programs provided deeper insights into the effect of accidental in vivo replication of genetically diverse vaccine strains in the central nervous system of target and non-target species under field conditions. The viral population in vaccine-derived cases appeared to be clonal in contrast to their parental vaccines. The change from a state of high population diversity present in the vaccine batches to a clonal genotype in the affected animal may indicate the presence of a strong bottleneck during infection. In conclusion, it is very likely that these few cases are the consequence of host factors and not the result of the selection of a more virulent genotype. Furthermore, this type of vaccine-derived rabies leads to the selection of clonal genotypes and the selected variants were genetically very similar to potent SAD vaccines that have undergone a history of in vitro selection.

AB The impact of crucial geographic and climatic factors on the input source errors of integrated multi-satellite precipitation estimates is an important but still unclear issue for both algorithm developers and data users. This study primarily focused on the impacts of the twelve input sources used in the latest Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM-GSMaP) for different climatic regions, elevations, and seasons over mainland China. Our evaluation results show that the error features of the input sources from several passive microwave and infrared sensors are related to the accuracy of GPM-GSMaP precipitation estimates. The input sources show larger hits, misses and false biases in the semi-arid and arid regions, for which the false bias was particularly significant. As for the seasonality, the input data sources exhibit a better performance in summer and have relatively lower hits and higher biases in winter. We also found that precipitation retrievals of the input sources are affected by topography in different extents. In terms of passive microwave sensors, the conical-scanning imagers generally outperform the cross-track-scanning sounders, but the sounders-based precipitation estimates have relatively better detection capability. As one of the core sensors for GPM, the microwave imager GMI reveals inadequacies in representing areal rainfall patterns and has relatively large biases especially in the winter and spring seasons, suggesting that the current GMI algorithm might need to be further improved.

AB The determination of area-averaged evapotranspiration (ET) over a heterogeneous land surface at the satellite pixel scale/model grid scale (10(3)-10(4) m) is crucial to the evaluation of the remote sensing ET products and development of the parameterization schemes of general hydro-meteorological models. The Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) flux matrix of multi-site eddy-covariance (EC) and large aperture scintillometers (LASs) provided an unprecedented opportunity to establish an aggregation scheme for determining area-averaged surface fluxes. Based on the HiWATER flux matrix datasets and high-resolution land-cover map, a new flux aggregation method was developed by using footprint analysis and multiple-linear regression. The area-averaged sensible heat fluxes aggregated from the multi-site EC flux measurements using the developed method were compared with the LAS measured fluxes. The results showed that the new method produced reasonable estimates of sensible heat flux with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) value of around 20-30%. The new aggregation method also significantly outperformed other methods being applied commonly, such as the rather simple area-weighted method. The daily ET of various land-cover types and the area-averaged ET over the key area of the Populus euphratica forest reserve in the Ejina Oasis were separately estimated using the established disaggregation and aggregation schemes of the new method. The area-averaged ET over this key area ranged between 1 and 5 mm d(-1) for the 68 days growing period in 2014. Results of this study can be used for the evaluation of relevant remote sensing models and land surface process models.

AB An autonomous, low cost (< US$750), and open source rainfall sampler has been developed for hydrogen and oxygen isotope research, able to sample daily and monthly for up to 60 days of rainfall, over a three month period. The sampler is designed to use modern fabrication methods such as 3D printing and laser cutting to minimise the need for machined and injection molded components. The sampler can use either paraffin oil or a submerged inlet tube (also known as tube-dip-in samplers) to prevent evaporation, with the use of the inlet tube method facilitated by 3D printed bottle caps. An experiment was performed to identify the most suitable plastic for these caps, with acetone treated ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) being most suitable, followed by PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol), untreated ABS, and PLA (Polylactic acid). In addition, the effectiveness of both paraffin oil and the inlet tube method for preventing evaporation was quantified, with paraffin identified as being the most effective at present. During a 90 day outdoor experiment, the O-18/O-16 vs. H-2/H-1 ratios of some water samples evolved along a local evaporation line, with increased isotopic enrichment of samples correlating to water loss. A coupled hydrologic-isotopic model was applied to these data, and successfully predicted the change in isotope ratios based on the amount of water lost from each sample. This modelling approach, combined with daily and monthly sample collection and quantification of evaporation rates within the sheltered environment of the sampler allows for back calculation of the original volume and isotopic composition of daily and monthly rainfall samples. The rainfall sampler thus facilitates cost -and time- effective remote monitoring of the isotopic composition of precipitation to support an array of Earth system research.

AB The soil carbon (C) reservoir involves soil organic and inorganic carbon stocks. The influence of soil erosion processes on soil organic carbon (SOC) migration has been investigated in the literature, but the influence on soil inorganic carbon (SIC) remains uncertain. Variations in the proportion of SOC and SIC in eroded sediment can influence C cycling, so we conducted a detailed laboratory study to investigate the selective transport of SOC and SIC in eroded sediment in treatments with different raindrop sizes and inflow rates. We used the boosted regression trees (BRT) models to estimate the SOC and SIC contents according to the ratio of flow depth and raindrop diameter (h/D), the maximum shear stress (tau*(max)), the runoff rate, the stream power (omega), the sediment concentration (SC), the soil loss rate (SLR), and various particle-related factors, including D50, D[4,3], D[3,2], clay content, silt content and sand content of non-dispersed sediment. The BRT model explained 42.1% and 56.1% of the variation in the SOC and SIC contents in the sediment, respectively. The relative importance of particle-related factors was approximately 50%, demonstrating that the particle size distribution (PSD) of sediment was a crucial factor for both SOC and SIC transport. The SOC content was sensitive to the presence of fine particles, while the SIC content was largely determined by coarse particles because smaller particles with a higher specific surface area tended to adsorb more SOC whereas coarser particles contained more carbonates in the form of binding agents. In sediment under intensive rainfall on steep slopes, the SOC tended to be depleted, while the SIC was slightly enriched. Our study demonstrates that both SIC and SOC were selectively transported by water erosion and fills gaps in this field of research. Moreover, this work implies that the PSD of the sediment provides important information about the variation in SOC and SIC and should be considered when modelling the global C cycle.

AB Physically-based numerical modelling of surface processes in urban drainage, such as pollutant wash-off or the assessment of flood risks, requires appropriate calibration and terrain elevation data to properly simulate the overland flows and thus to achieve useful results. Accordingly, this study aims to obtain an accurate representation of the runoff generated by three different rain intensities, 30, 50 and 80 mm/h, in a full-scale urban drainage physical model of 36 m(2). The study focuses firstly on applying the Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetric technique to carry out a high-resolution and accurate topographic survey. This topography was implemented in a 2D shallow water model and the results were compared with those obtained using traditional data point measured topography. Negligible differences were found when comparing the two models with measured discharges at the physical model gully pots. However, significant differences were obtained in the velocity distributions, especially in the shallowest flow areas where drainage channels of a few millimeters' depth appeared in the high resolution topographic survey. Results from the numerical model were compared with overland flow velocities, determined by applying a modified Large Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV) methodology using fluorescent particles. With the SfM topography, the 2D model was able to obtain a better representation of the experimental data, since small scale irregularities of the pavement surface could be represented in the model domain. At the same time, LSPIV was presented as a very suitable tool for the accurate measurement of runoff velocities in urban drainage models, avoiding the interference of raindrop features in the recorded images and with overland water depths in the order of few millimeters.

AB Structural, parametric and measurement uncertainties are inherent in watershed hydrology models. Among these, structural uncertainty results from simplified representation of reality in models and has proven to be particularly challenging to characterize. Often, flow measurements are available at the outlet or a few other locations within a watershed, and distributed model parameters are calibrated to replicate observed streamflow values. Subsequently, one can quantify uncertainty in streamflow estimation at the measured locations. The objective of this study is the quantification of structural and parametric uncertainty at unmeasured locations using a calibrated watershed hydrologic model. While propagation of parametric uncertainty to unmeasured locations is a relatively simple task in a Bayesian framework, this study is focused on the problem of structural uncertainty propagation. We propose to treat the hydrologic model as a stochastic function by treating the parameters of the model as random quantities, even in the limit of infinite information through data, thus enabling us to accommodate the uncertainty due to structural errors. A mathematical formulation of the method and applications over two different watersheds, using hourly and daily flow data, are presented. The structural uncertainty band at ungauged locations enveloped all the streamflow observations at daily-scale and missed most of the observations at hourly-scale. Structural uncertainty varies spatially at unmeasured locations within the watershed. Consequently, streamflows estimated at unmeasured locations may be accompanied by wide uncertainty bands implying the need for caution when using them.

AB Spatial and temporal distributions of soil moisture are important for explaining hydrological processes at the hillslope scale. The fate of various hillslope flow paths can vary seasonally and their relationship with rainfall events can be nonstationary. We collected high resolution in situ soil moisture datasets at 30 points (10 locations in three depths) between March and November in a steep mountainous hillslope. The wavelet coherence analysis of eco-hydrometeorological factors and soil moistures indicated distinctive controls of rainfall and evapotranspiration over soil moisture at time scales of under a day. The vertical flow in upslope areas can be explained by significant wavelet coherence in soil moisture profiles. The appearance of lateral flow with vertical flow in the downslope is associated with even more significant wavelet coherence between identical depths. The wavelet coherence analysis between two soil moisture time series both along hillslope layers and depth profiles provided good spatial and temporal representations of hillslope hydrological processes in terms of their timing and scale. The distributions of soil moisture coherences showed distinctive characteristics for three different seasons. The seasonally distinctive role of vegetation to infiltration was apparent for the upslope area, but the combined impact of vegetation and topography controlled more complicated hydrological processes in the downslope area. The phase angle analysis was introduced to show the profile difference of hydrological processes on various time scales.

AB Dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) have led to widely distributed groundwater contamination due to their widespread applications and accidental spills. To investigate influences of two factor-ionic strength and permeability on the representative elementary volume (REV) of DNAPL, four experiments are conducted in two-dimensional (2D) porous media to investigate perchloroethylene (PCE) migration and associated REVs. The permeability and ionic strength of four experiments are set as different schemes. PCE migration and REVs are estimated by moment analysis and the criteria of the relative gradient error (epsilon(i)(g)). Results suggest that the permeability and ionic strength are of significant effects on REVs of PCE. Higher permeability of porous media can promote the vertical infiltrate rate of PCE in aquifer. Simultaneously, higher ionic strength can lower the second moments of PCE plume and increase the GTP of PCE mass. More importantly, higher permeability has increased the REV of PCE saturation (S-o) with absolute errors of 1.35 mm and 2.71 mm under conditions of low and high ionic strength. Besides, higher permeability has decreased the REV of PCE-water interfacial area (A(ow)) with absolute errors of 2.76 mm and 1.09 mm under conditions of low and high ionic strength. What's more, ionic strength has no apparent effects on S-o-REV sizes when permeability is high (absolute error equals to 0.16 mm between low and high ionic strength). However, high ionic strength can decrease the minimum REV sizes of S-o when permeability is low (absolute error is 1.52 mm). Moreover, high ionic strength can increase minimum REV sizes of Aow with absolute errors of 1.49 mm and 1.01 mm under conditions of high and low permeability. These findings can improve the understanding of DNAPLs behaviors in subsurface environment under complex condition.

TI Microbial mat contribution to the formation of an evaporitic environment

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Saline basin; Evaporite; Calcium carbonate; Water retention; Salinity
ID EVOLUTION
AB An evaporitic environment is characterized by having high salinity, climatic, and hydrological factors that promote a negative water balance; however, biological factors may also influence their development. Modern coastal flat Paso Seco (40 degrees 33'S; 62 degrees 14'W) is located in a semi-arid region with low precipitation and dry winds coming mainly from the NW. The site is an old tidal channel, which nowadays behaves like a shallow coastal saline-like basin, separated from the sea by a sand barrier, which the sea periodically overcomes, flooding the flat with eventual water evaporation. Microbial mats of up to 1 cm thick colonize the sandy sediments of this evaporitic environment. Water samples were taken during five field trips (2017-2018) from interstitial water of the flat, a tidal creek that crosses the flat, and two shallow tidal depressions (TDs) within the flat with different degrees of evaporation. In comparison to the sea, the maximum salinity values measured in Austral spring (September 2017) in the tidal creek were doubled, tripled in interstitial water, and 5.9 to 8 times higher in TDs. Ionic concentration denotes that evaporite chemical divides are followed as water evaporates, corresponding to the presence of CaCO3, gypsum and halite found in TDs. On-site permeability of microbial mat-covered surfaces presented semi-pervious properties. Microbial mat presence is condition for CaCO3, gypsum, and halite precipitation as they allow for water retention and its consequent evaporation due to the impermeability they confer to the sedimentary surface, Thus, microbial mats are a biological factor affecting the development of an evaporitic environment.

ID DISCHARGE; CAPACITY; RIVER; PREDICTION; STRAIGHT; VELOCITY
AB A new stage discharge relationship is suggested for wide meandering streams (ratio of floodplain width and that of main channel in excess of 5.5 and up to 30) with overbank flow. The boundary shear data obtained from various data series with specified range of width ratio and channel sinuosity are analysed. By regression technique, new empirical relationships are derived between the channel dimensions and amount of shear generated for different flow conditions. These new boundary shear models are then used to obtain the stage discharge relation in channels with given roughness characteristics. The present method is then validated for its usefulness by applying the same to a number of data series of small scale and large scale flume experiments of other research projects from the literature. The errors (%) in discharge estimation are within limits for such methods as per practice (i.e. around +/- 10% for both smooth and rough meandering channels). The method is also compared with a number of other methods from the literature by application to different data series. The RMSE (root mean squared error) value for all the data series validated is estimated as 9.6% and the method is found to be ranked third among all the methods. The method is also able to predict satisfactorily the flow distribution in case of a number of homogeneously smooth and non homogeneously roughened meandering channels of varying sinuosity with overbank flow for large scale flume experimental data sets. The mean error for three available data series is estimated as - 3.4% while the RMSE error is 10.68%. Due to its ease of application and simple approach, this 1D method may serve as a preliminary design tool for assessing stage discharge curve for wide two stage channels in field conditions for application in flood estimation and flood warning cum relief measures. Such a preliminary study might better decide the need for further refinement through any exhaustive deep study; the more robust and expensive 2D or 3D analysis.

AB This study investigated the potential of assessing the water balance in South America, at multiple scales, using satellite remote sensing precipitation and evapotranspiration datasets, terrestrial water storage changes from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), and discharge measurements. The remote sensing precipitation datasets included those of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), whilst the ET constituents included the MODIS Global Evapotranspiration Project (MOD16) and the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM). Uncertainties in precipitation and ET were evaluated using in situ measurements of 307 rain-gauge stations and 16 eddy covariance sites, respectively. The water balance closure and uncertainties were evaluated in 50 basins for the period 2003-2014, at different spatial scales and under different climatic conditions. Overall, MSWEP precipitation and GLEAM ET provided fewer uncertainties, whilst TRMM and MOD16 yielded greater bias and more errors. Better agreements between the TWSC from GRACE and the water balance were found in the large and medium-sized basins, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of about 42%, whilst small basins and those located in regions with subtropical humid climates, where precipitation did not present strong seasonality, had a RMSE around 130%, indicating that climate conditions can influence the water balance closure. The TWSC from GRACE and the remote sensing water balance estimations were in agreement for more than half of the evaluated basins, mainly those located in tropical climate regions. Greater bias and more errors were found in the estimations of discharge in the semi-arid basins, with low runoff coefficients. Despite the water balance based on remote sensing estimations remaining a challenge due to the large uncertainties in precipitation, ET, and TWSC, our results showed their great potential for assessing terrestrial water-cycle dynamics and understanding their spatial and temporal variability at multiple scales.

AB The development of water quality prediction models is an important step towards better water quality management of rivers. The traditional method for computing WQI is always associated with errors due to the protracted analysis of the water quality parameters in addition to the great effort and time involved in gathering and analyzing water samples. In addition, the cost of identifying the magnitude of some of the parameters through experimental testing is very high. The water quality of rivers in Malaysia is ranked into five classes based on water quality index (WQI). WQI is function of six water quality parameters: ammoniac nitrogen (NH3-N), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and suspended solids (SS). In this research, the decision tree machine learning technique is used to predict the WQI for the Kiang River and its classification within a specific water quality class. Kiang River is one of the most polluted rivers in Malaysia. Modeling experiments are designed to test the prediction and classification accuracy of the model based on various scenarios composed of different water quality parameters. Results show that the proposed prediction model has a promising potential to predict the class of the WQI. Moreover, the proposed model offers a more efficient process and cost-effective approach for the computation and prediction of WQI.

AB Eklutna Lake is the primary water supply for Anchorage, Alaska; therefore the hydrogeologic properties of Eklutna surficial deposits are important to characterize. However, there is limited data on the hydraulic conductivity of surficial deposits in the Eklutna basin. This study presents hydraulic conductivity (K-fs and K-sat) measurements using two methods: the bottomless bucket and particle size distribution methods. Statistically, the two methods produced similar results; however, the large range in values obtained for K-fs and K-sat suggests there is a great degree of natural variation. One method used a bottomless bucket in place of a ring infiltrometer to measure field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-fs). The other method used a sieve-derived particle size distribution to solve a modified Hazen equation for K-sat. Of 47 samples collected in nine surficial geologic units, from poorly-sorted to well-sorted soils, the means of the two datasets were statistically similar: 49 m/day (K-fs) vs. 41 m/day (K-sat). Although the variability between the datasets was significantly different, with a standard deviation ranging from 44 m/day (K-fs) to 75 m/day (K-sat), the Wilcoxon paired-samples and paired t-test results suggest the datasets are statistically similar. Additionally, 98% of the 47 paired values were within one order of magnitude of each other. The methods presented herein can be used for surficial geologic unit delineation, planning purposes and optimizing hydrological models.

Sensitivity analysis by the elementary effect (Morris) method was applied to a 3D steady-state hydrological model built with the fully-integrated HydroGeoSphere code. Parameter sensitivity with respect to various model outputs was explored, providing comprehensive insights into the most hydrologically relevant parameters. The results indicated that depending on model outputs the most influential model parameters varied. They also revealed existence of feedback in terms of interdependence of parameters between the esker aquifer and surrounding aapa mires. The properties of the mire (or peatland) landscape affected groundwater levels in the unconfined aquifer and, conversely, esker-mire interactions depended on esker hydraulic characteristics. This implies that accurate representation of both systems is required and that reliable determination of GW-SW interactions may be impeded by parameter interactions. In this study, the van Genuchten functions were used to represent hydraulic properties of unsaturated flow domain and the results revealed that formal sensitivity analysis methods based on random sampling might not be appropriate for evaluating parametric sensitivity. If the van Genuchten parameters ranges are large, randomly sampled values may not always produce physically realistic water retention characteristics. Overall, our results demonstrate that the computationally efficient elementary effect method is a suitable tool for investigating the parametric sensitivity of integrated models, enhancing modelling of boreal groundwater-dependent ecosystems.

AB Recent annual trends of precipitation and terrestrial water storage (TWS) in West Africa have been increasing over the past decade. Despite a significant impact of soil moisture on the TWS in West Africa, there is little research on the recent spatial and temporal behaviors of surface soil moisture (SSM) along with the hydrological trends and variability in West Africa. In this study, we assimilate TWS estimates from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission into the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) and evaluate its impacts on SSM simulations for the years, 2002-2017. The evaluation is performed using reference datasets: the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) in situ soil moisture observations, three currently available microwave satellite SSM observations from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS), and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites and also the triple collocation analysis (TCA). Overall, modeled SSM shows good agreement with the reference datasets in terms of the anomaly SSM correlations. However, both modeled and ASCAT SSM are limited in their representation of the drying rates, as observed by ground observations, SMOS and SMAP estimates. Further, GRACE data assimilation results in improved SSM simulations in the humid regions with large annual TWS variability. This study demonstrates the utility of land data assimilation to inform hydrological conditions in West Africa, where soil moisture monitoring is necessary for water resource and livestock management.

AB Trend analysis is continuously in the research and application agenda due to climate change effect searches on various engineering, social, economic, agriculture, environmental and water resources design, management, operation and management studies. Classical trend analysis is useable for holistic trend identification and then statistical quantification as for its intercept and slope. The main drawbacks in these classical approaches are the set of fundamental assumptions such as the serial independence of the given time series, pre-whitening, normality of the data and non-existence of serial comparison among different sections of the same record. This paper explains a non-parametric approach to avoid almost all these difficulties by simple methodology, which is referred as the Innovative Polygonal Trend Analysis (IPTA). Such an approach helps not only to identify the trend in a given series, but also trend transitions between successive sections of the two equal segments from the original hydro-meteorological time series leading to trend polygon, which provides a productive basis for finer interpretation with linguistic and numerical interpretations and inferences from a given time series. The application of the IPTA is presented for rainfall records from New Jersey, USA, Danube River and Goksu River discharge records from Romania and Turkey.

AB Soil hydraulic conductivity (K) significantly affects subsurface flow and solute transport, but convenient measurement of K remains a challenge. Electrical conductivity (EC), which can be measured conveniently and accurately, can be quantitatively related to K because of the similarity between current movement and groundwater flow, motivating us to estimate K using EC. A soil column apparatus was built to explore the relation between EC and K. Fifty-four experiments were conducted under various degrees of soil compaction and grain diameters, including six different particle sizes, three compaction levels, and six solution concentrations. The overall (negative) correlation between K and EC can be fitted reasonably well by an exponential function with a large determination coefficient (> 0.81) for each solute concentration, while a power-law function better fits the correlation when K is larger than 10 m/d. These experiments led to several empirical models (for specific solution concentrations) and one comprehensive model (with variable parameters) to estimate K given EC. In the field, if the EC of pore water can be measured, the empirical models under the specific solution concentrations can be applied to greatly improve the K estimation. Comparison showed that the proposed models, which provides a quick estimate of K using easily available EC, performed better than most of the classical grain size-based formulas. Although there is uncertainty in the K estimation likely due to the limited control factors considered in this study, the new method proposed above can provide a convenient estimate for K for the field site with strong spatial heterogeneity.

AB Suction in subgrade layer reaches an equilibrium condition several years after construction of the pavement. The equilibrium suction has a direct influence on the resilient modulus of subgrade soil. In the current mechanistic-empirical pavement design guide, equilibrium suction is determined based on the empirical relationship with water table depth. However studies have shown that other critical factors also influence equilibrium suction. In this study, a new mechanistic-empirical model is presented to predict equilibrium suction considering the effects of physical properties of the soil and climatic factors. A simple regression model is also generated to predict the equilibrium suction from readily available parameters i.e., Thornthwaite moisture index (TMI), plasticity index (P1), and dry suction value at surface (u(dry)). In the final section of this paper, the effects of TMI and vegetation on equilibrium suction are evaluated for various soil classes and TMI ranges, respectively. A contour map of the equilibrium suction values for the entire continental United States has been generated using the geographic information system (GIS) platform and followed by the model predictions.

AB Due to shallow groundwater tables and easy water availability, many people live in coastal areas. Additionally, alluvial sediments from fluviatile and marine deposits are highly suitable for agricultural use, making coastal settlement even more desirable. However, groundwater nitrate pollution resulting from widespread application of fertilizers creates difficulties for water management officials. Cut-off walls are used to control seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers. However, until now, the effect of cut-off walls on the nitrate contamination of groundwater has been largely unknown. In this paper, the first investigation of the influence of a subsurface cut-off wall on nitrate contamination in groundwater is discussed. Two sets of laboratory experiments - one with and one without a subsurface cut-off wall - were performed to validate the effectiveness of the constructed numerical model. The effects of the subsurface cut-off wall height, distance between the subsurface cut-off wall and the saltwater boundary, and infiltration rates on nitrate distribution and contamination in groundwater were analyzed. Results showed that after the construction of the subsurface cut-off wall, the domain mean velocity decreased, the migration of nitrate pollutants to the saltwater boundary was reduced, and the nitrate-contaminated area expanded. Further, the morphology of the nitrate pollution plumes changed, an indentation appeared directly above the subsurface cut-off wall, the widths of the transition zones increased significantly, and the transition zones became more diffuse as one approached the saltwater wedge. Three indices were developed to quantify the degree of nitrate contamination. The relative height of the subsurface cut-off wall (H') and the nitrate infiltration rate (Ni) were the two most significant factors determining the degree of nitrate contamination in groundwater near the subsurface cut-off wall. Therefore, we suggest that subsurface cut-off walls be designed such that their height lies below an experimentally determined critical height; thus reducing the infiltration rate of the contaminants produced during fertilization through water-saving irrigation techniques.

AB Assessment of large-scale temperature dynamics and heat fluxes in shallow lakes requires comprehensive modeling capabilities to simulate water interactions, the processes related to the heat budget, and their driving forces. In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal variations in water-surface temperature (WST) and surface heat fluxes for the period between January 2001 and December 2010 in Lake Mirim, a large (surface area ca. 4000 km(2)) shallow lake on the Brazil-Uruguay border. The aquatic ecosystem was examined using in-situ WST measurements, MODIS land surface temperature (M*D11A1 LST) products, and a coupling between a large-scale hydrologic model (MGB-IPH) and a hydrodynamic/water quality model (IPH-ECO). The WST values estimated by the hydrodynamic model were consistent with measured in-situ data and MODIS-derived WST, using both daytime and nighttime time series (R-2 = 0.88; Bias = 1.45 degrees C; RMSE = 2.16 degrees C; ENS = 0.77). Our findings also revealed that the dominant heat fluxes in the lake are the atmospheric longwave radiation (annual mean = 303.38 W m(-2)), water longwave radiation (annual mean = 336.01 W m(-2)), and the latent heat flux (annual mean = 51.14 W m(-2)). Additionally, the heat flux from the river inflows contribute minimally to the overall seasonal heat budget in the lake, being the Cebollati river the main contributor (annual average = 4.63 W m(-2)). Coupled large-scale hydrological and hydrodynamic models will benefit future modeling efforts by providing an effective management tool to study the effect of case scenarios (e.g., climate change) on temperature dynamics, heat fluxes, and physical and ecological processes in these ecosystems.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) and its dominant controls show obvious elevational pattern on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, due to heterogeneous environmental conditions regulated by altitude. To understand better how and why ET varies at different altitudes in the Qinghai Lake watershed, this study measured and retrieved soil moisture, solar radiation, and ET data between 3300 m and 4700 m, and further investigated the influence of water and energy conditions on ET. Results showed that, the mean annual terrestrial ET was 343 and 360 mm in this watershed in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The higher ET mainly appeared in the midstream of Shaliu River and on the southern region of Qinghai Lake, while the sand land on the east of Qinghai Lake and the bare rock in the northwest of the watershed had the lowest values. The ET increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of altitude, and its peak value appeared at 3600-3700 m. The dominant controls for ET switched from water conditions to energy conditions with the increase of elevation. The maximum limited fraction [(predicted value - actual value)/predicted value x 100] of ET by water condition (soil moisture content) achieved 11.2% and 10.1% at 3300-3350 m in 2014 and 2015, and the corresponding mean area-weighted values were 7.3% and 5.4% at 3300-3650 m, respectively. The maximum limited fraction of ET by energy condition (shortwave radiation and air temperature) achieved 24.4% and 29.8% at 4650-4700 m in 2014 and 2015, and the corresponding mean area-weighted values were 10.8% and 11.9% at 3650-4700 m, respectively. Overall, the energy conditions were more influential factors limiting the ET in the entire watershed, and this conclusion is critical for the management of regional terrestrial ecosystem with future climate change.

AB Problems have a high rank in decision making when they are both urgent and important. Accordingly, water has not earned the attention it deserves in public policy agenda because under normal circumstances it is not viewed as an urgent matter in the eyes of the public and politicians. By creating a sense of urgency, extreme events such as droughts, floods, conflicts, and migrations can create opportunities for implementing some essential policy reforms that would be politically costly otherwise. So, despite their high short-term costs, extreme natural and societal events have the potential to increase the resilience of water systems in the long run. It is argued here that the societal and political sense of urgency about water must be promoted through public outreach and information dissemination. Otherwise, for useful reforms and long-term improvements, we will rely on costly and risky extreme events that sometimes have the potential to fully collapse the human-natural system-of-systems.

AB Interactions between surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) have been identified as a major contributing factor to non-stationarity in rainfall-runoff relationships. However, because existing rainfall-runoff models do not realistically account for these SW-GW interactions, they fail to robustly simulate runoff during multi-year droughts, especially in arid and semi-arid catchments that are relatively flat. Therefore, this study introduces a linked SW-GW modelling approach and tests it under different climatic conditions (Average, Dry and Wet periods) in two heterogeneous, semi-arid catchments in southeast Australia (SEA). The linked SW-GW modelling approach includes a fully-distributed SW (i.e. rainfall-runoff) model (SWATgrid) and a three-dimensional finite-difference GW model (MODFLOW). The results show that the linked SW-GW modelling approach produces highly improved runoff simulations for the study catchments, especially during dry conditions. These findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for SW-GW interactions when conducting rainfall-runoff modelling and highlights that failing to do so will result in overestimation of runoff during droughts - this is salient given projections for hotter and drier futures in many semi-arid regions. Although the study is focused on SEA, the insights gained are highly applicable for water managers in any region that experience high hydroclimatic variability or change.

AB The intensity-duration frequency (IDF) curve has been used as an effective tool to quantify the risk associated with the impact of extreme rainfall on civil infrastructure. However, recent changes in the rainfall climatology caused by climate change and urbanization have made estimates in the stationary environment provided by the traditional regional IDF approach increasingly inaccurate. This inaccuracy is mainly caused by the lack of consideration for the temporal and spatial differences in the selection of similarity indicators (attributes that are used to measure similarity of extreme rainfall patterns among different stations), resulting in ineffective formation of homogeneous groups (group of stations that share similar extreme rainfall patterns) at various regions. To consider the temporal differences of similarity indicators, including meteorological factors, topographic features and urban impact indicators, a three-layer design is proposed based on the three stages in extreme rainfall formation: cloud formation, rainfall generation and change of rainfall intensity over an urban surface. During the process, the impacts from climate change and urbanization on extreme rainfall patterns are considered through the inclusion of potential features that relate to the rainfall mechanism at each layer. The spatial differences of similarity indicators for Homogeneous Group Formation (HGF) at various regions is resolved by using an automatic feature selection and weighting algorithm, specifically the hybrid searching algorithm of Tabu Search, Lagrange Multiplier and Fuzzy C-means clustering, to select the optimal combination of features for HGF based on the uncertainty in the regional estimates of the rainfall quantiles for a specific site. The proposed methodology fills the gap of including the urbanization impacts on the extreme rainfall patterns during HGF process and challenges the traditional assumption that the same set of features can be equally effective in generating the optimal homogeneous group in regions with different geographic and meteorological characteristics.

AB The satisfactory separation of baseflow from the other components of streamflow has long been a desirable but elusive goal. In the search for consistent and automated baseflow separation techniques, direct applicability to physical processes has been increasingly neglected. By way of contrast, this paper presents a continuous baseflow separation method that emphasises the physical relevance of the flow components, and demonstrates its performance. The proposed method combines the principle of an exponential master baseflow recession with a compatible smoothing function to link the segments of the master recession. Two calibrated parameters facilitate a good fit to a range of streamflow behaviours.

AB The main objective of this research work was to propose and verify a new soft computing approach based on Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for spatial prediction of flash flood susceptible areas. A high frequency tropical typhoon area located on Northwest of Vietnam was selected as a case study. For this purpose, a GIS database for the study areas was prepared, including 654 flash-flood inundations and 12 influencing variables (elevation, slope, curvature, toposhade, aspect, topographic wetness index, stream power index, stream density, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, soil type, lithology, and rainfall), which were compiled from various sources. The database was used to build and verify the prediction model. We assessed the model's performance through various indices including Classification Accuracy Rate, Area under the Curve (AUC), Precision, and Recall. We also compared the model's usability with five state-of-the-art machine learning techniques including the Backpropagation Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Classification Tree. The results revealed that the hybrid PSO-MARS model outperformed other benchmark models in all the employed statistical measures. We conclude that the proposed model can be particularly suited for flash flood forecasting problems at high frequency tropical typhoon area.

AB Pore systems become very complex in heterogeneous reservoirs such as low-permeability and tight sandstones for macropores and micropores both exist in such reservoirs. Although the large pores may control the reservoir quality and rock properties, micropores always can affect the geometric and transport properties of the pore systems. In this paper, thus, such an effect is studied comprehensively. As such, low- and high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scanning experiments were carried out on the same low-permeability sandstone in order to obtain the low- and high-resolution digital rock (LRDR and HRDR) images, respectively. The impacts of micropores on properties of pore systems were investigated based on digital rock analysis of the LRDR and HRDR images for two samples. In this study, the micro-porosity is defined as the pores and throats which can be covered by the HRDR images but cannot be covered by the LRDR images. The results show that there are better connectivity, smaller tortuosity and higher heterogeneity for the HRDR image, compared to the LRDR image of the same rock. The fractal analysis of pore space indicates that the surface of the pore space with micropores becomes rougher. Moreover, we found that the micropore space plays a more significant role in the throats than the pores by comparing the pore and throat size distributions of the LRDR and HRDR images. In addition, the micropores can lead to a decrease in the average shape factor and smoothness of the boundary of pores and throats. It was also found that micro-porosity not only increases the average coordination number but also increases the number of isolated pores according to the coordination number distributions. Finally, the results of single- and two-phase flow simulation show that the absolute permeability and formation factor become larger and smaller, respectively, for the pore systems with micropores. This result reveals that micropores can improve the transportability and connectivity of the pore systems.

AB During the expansion of urban areas, small natural reserves have often been left intact within the built environment as central elements of biodiversity conservation, ecological connectivity, landscape sustainability, and quality of life of urban dwellers. Consequently, the surrounding urbanized landscape may impact the environmental conditions of these reserves (e.g., high temperatures, low moisture conditions), resulting in the need for extensive maintenance. This study presents an estimation of the water balance over two years (2017-2018) in three small urban reserves (between 2 and 30 ha) within the Greater Melbourne metropolitan area in Australia, for the purpose of understanding tree water use. Measurements of micrometeorological variables, soil moisture content profiles, water-table levels, sap flow velocities, and stem diameter variations were used to quantify the water sources of tree transpiration in these reserves. Results revealed that, despite the urban surroundings and the climate variations, these reserves have enough water to sustain tree transpiration. In two of the three reserves, groundwater was pivotal in sustaining transpiration rates; specifically, groundwater was estimated to contribute about 30-40% of the total transpiration amount during the driest periods of the year. Groundwater also played an essential role during nights with temperatures above 25 degrees C, helping trees to maintain night-time water use from 3 to 16% of the daily water use. In the third reserve, the presence of a shallow layer of heavy clay supplied water to the trees, which were able to maintain relatively constant transpiration rates throughout the year. These results demonstrate the importance of understanding the water regime of each urban reserve in order to support government authorities in preserving these ecosystems.

AB The generation of hydrometeorological time series that exhibit a given probabilistic and stochastic behavior across multiple temporal levels, traditionally expressed in terms of specific statistical characteristics of the observed data, is a crucial task for risk-based water resources studies, and simultaneously a puzzle for the community of stochastics. The main challenge stems from the fact that the reproduction of a specific behavior at a certain temporal level does not imply the reproduction of the desirable behavior at any other level of aggregation. In this respect, we first introduce a pairwise coupling of Nataf-based stochastic models within a disaggregation scheme, and next we propose their puzzle-type configuration to provide a generic stochastic simulation framework for multivariate processes exhibiting any distribution and any correlation structure. Within case studies we demonstrate two characteristic configurations, i.e., a three-level one, operating at daily, monthly and annual basis, and a two-level one to disaggregate daily to hourly data. The first configuration is applied to generate correlated daily rainfall and runoff data at the river basin of Achelous, Western Greece, which preserves the stochastic behavior of the two processes at the three temporal levels. The second configuration disaggregates daily rainfall, obtained from a meteorological station at Germany, to hourly. The two studies reveal the ability of the proposed framework to represent the peculiar behavior of hydrometeorological processes at multiple temporal resolutions, as well as its flexibility on formulating generic simulation schemes.

AB Forecasting ice jams and their consequential flooding is more challenging than predicting open water flood conditions. This is due to the chaotic nature of ice jam formation since slight changes in water and ice flows, location of the ice jam toe along the river and initial water levels at the time of jam formation can lead to marked differences in the outcome of backwater level elevations and flood severity. In this paper, we introduce a novel, operational real-time flood forecasting system that captures this stochastic nature of ice-jam floods and places the forecasts in a probabilistic context in the form of flood hazard maps (probability of flood extents and depths). This novel system was tested successfully for the ice-cover breakup period in the spring of 2018 along the Athabasca River at the Town of Fort McMurray, Canada.

AB Trees in semiarid conditions survive despite water scarcity and shallow soils because they commonly have access to subsoil water resources. Currently, conventional models do not include groundwater transpiration and the results frequently underestimate the actual evapotranspiration and overestimate the net recharge. Therefore, in this work we focus on how a multi-variable calibration with a multi-objective approach may improve model robustness leading to a more realistic closure of the water balance in two models (LEACHM and TETIS) of different conceptualisation taking into account the specific characteristics of a facultative phreatophytic forest. The results suggest that the common single-variable and single-objective calibration is not able to measure all system's characteristics. However, the multi-variable and multi-objective calibration proved a good option to reproduce the water dynamics of a facultative phreatophytic forest and confirmed that groundwater transpiration is an important water source for them. Therefore, hydrological models should include this mechanism and both LEACHM and TETIS proved an acceptable tool to be applied in the regions covered by this species.

AB Soil compaction during post-fire logging can increase runoff and erosion. Increasing surface cover is an effective way to reduce erosion, but this has not been tested on soils impacted by both fire and compaction. We measured the effects of compaction (bulk density of 0.9 or 1.1 g cm(-3)) and surface cover (0% or 60%) using bark mulch or logging slash (compacted only) on runoff, leaching and erosion. Four 0.5 m(2) plots per treatment were filled with burned soil and inclined to 18 degrees. Two 30-min simulated rainfall events with 72 nun h(-1) intensity and one concentrated flow event were applied to each plot.
   The runoff from the dry and wet runs totaled 32 mm in the uncompacted bare plots and the value was not significantly different for the compacted bare plots, any of the mulch plots, or the compacted slash plots. Leaching was higher for the uncompacted bare plots (7 mm) than for the compacted bare plots (1 mm), and mulch or slash did not affect leaching. The uncompacted bare plots produced 38 g of rainsplash and 497 g m(-2) of sheetwash, and these were about half the values for the compacted bare plots. Mulching strongly reduced the rainsplash and sheetwash for both the uncompacted (10 g and 184 g m(-2), respectively) and compacted conditions (19 g and 431 g m(-2), respectively), although the difference in sheetwash was only significant for the uncompacted plots. Slash also reduced rainsplash (19 g) relative to the compacted bare plots (74 g) but did not affect sheetwash. Concentrated flow produced 858 g m(-2) of rilling from the uncompacted bare plots, which was greater than the compacted plots (237 g m(-2)). Mulching reduced rilling by 95% in the uncompacted plots and 78% in the compacted plots, but slash did not reduce rilling.
   The reductions in rainsplash erosion caused by the mulch and slash were attributed to the increase in surface cover, which reduced the energy imparted to the soil by the rainfall. The mulch, with its high degree of contact with the soil, also reduced particle detachment and transport by overland flow. In contrast, the slash did not have complete contact with the soil surface and did not affect sheetwash or rilling. Compaction and the type of material used to increase surface cover are important factors to consider when assessing potential impacts of logging on runoff and sediment delivery from burned soils.

AB Groundwater is a priceless resource in Alberta and therefore, estimating groundwater are crucial to identifying and promoting holistic and integrated management of groundwater-surface water. However, it is a challenge to simulate groundwater storage due to the current rudimentary representation of two-way groundwater-surface water exchange in current hydrologic models, such as Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which, in turn, limits our ability to predict land-atmosphere processes and groundwater storage. In this study, we modified the SWAT model to improve module of evapotranspiration in two-way groundwater-surface water exchange. The modified SWAT was calibrated and validated against the groundwater table height and evapotranspiration from 2008 to 2011 period at two location (Lethbridge and Barons) Alberta, Canada. The results showed that the modified SWAT model predicts the groundwater table height very well at both locations. The modified model predicted the daily groundwater table height with R-2 values of 0.86 and 0.89 in the calibration period (2008-2009), 0.81 and 0.83 for the validation period (2010-2011) at Lethbridge and Barons, respectively. The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) for daily groundwater table height was 0.69 and 0.71 during calibration periods (2008-2009) while the model gives lower values of NSE 0.65 and 0.67 for validation periods (2010-2011) at Lethbridge and Barons, respectively. Similarly, the model estimates evapotranspiration well with correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.77 during the calibration period and 0.81 for validation period. Our result showed that the modified SWAT model did improve estimates to dynamic groundwater table heights.

AB Despite the expectation that increases in rainfall with climatic change will result in increases in pluvial flooding, there is more historical evidence for decreases in flood magnitude. In Australia, as in many other parts of the world, flood magnitudes are mostly decreasing, despite increasing rainfall extremes. Here, we show how changes in soil moisture have led to decreasing flood magnitudes while rainfall extremes have been increasing.
   Using gauged streamflow, catchment average rainfall, and modelled soil moisture data across Australia we confirm that streamflow peaks (or floods) that occur at least once a year are strongly related to both the peak rainfall causing the flood and the antecedent soil moisture conditions preceding the storm event. Regions where the magnitude of the peak flow has decreased are visually and statistically correlated to regions of decreasing soil moisture. Flood magnitudes are more likely to increase only for the rarest events, with increases in rainfall offset by decreases in soil moisture for more frequent events. A recurrence interval dependent tipping point is identified beyond which trends in catchment rainfall outweigh those of soil moisture trends and dominate the flood response. For regions where soil moisture has decreased, this tipping point occurs at an average recurrence interval of ten years or more. As most studies investigating trends in flooding generally use annual maxima, changes in soil moisture are likely to be the dominant mechanism behind observed flood trends. Hence changes in soil moisture conditions need to be considered when predicting catchment flood response due to climatic change.

AB There is a need for enhanced guidance in siting distributed, infiltrative green infrastructure (GI) practices, especially in densely developed urban watersheds where retrofits come at a high cost. To maximize the hydrologic benefit of GI practices on urban streams, the disconnection of effective impervious areas (EIA), or those impervious areas hydraulically connected to the stormwater network, has been identified as a strategic management approach that is expected to have the greatest impact. The overall effect of full disconnection of spatially-identified EIA on watershed hydrology is uncertain because this type of full disconnection is rarely brought to full-scale implementation. In this study, spatial EIA identification is used to parametrize an urban runoff model using the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). The calibrated model is used to assess runoff reductions resulting from GI practices distributed through the watershed via different placement strategies, both spatially-informed and not. Full treatment of the spatially identified EIA using bioretention cells was compared to two scenarios treating the same area of impervious surfaces, but with random placement either among all impervious areas or placement focused in areas of higher imperviousness. Model results indicate that substantially higher runoff reduction could be realized by targeting EIA, with a median runoff reduction of nearly 30% more than other treatment scenarios across storm events ranging from 1.27 to 20.7 mm using this strategic siting. Further improvements in optimizing distributed infiltrative GI practice placement are needed and targeting of spatially-identified EIA appears to be a viable method for increasing the hydrologic improvements realized through watershed scale implementations.

AB Vulnerability assessment is an essential step for urban flood risk management. Due to the objective existence of statistical errors in the variables and spatial heterogeneity, as well as the similarity of flood experience, precautionary status and environments for neighbouring areas, an urban flood vulnerability assessment essentially entails a multi-factor decision-making process that accounts for uncertainties and the local spatial dependence of neighbourhoods. To address these issues, an uncertainty-based vulnerability assessment approach embedded with an improved moving split-window (IMSW) analysis and probabilistic method is proposed. To develop an integrated urban flood vulnerability assessment model, three technical issues need to be resolved: (1) the development of damage curves of land-use types, (2) an uncertainty model and spatial dependence model of damages based on an IMSW analysis, and (3) an uncertainty-based framework to quantify vulnerability considering the uncertainties and local spatial dependence of the damage curves as well as the spatial heterogeneity of risky assets simultaneously. The proposed method is applied to an urban area in China and provides an integrated vulnerability assessment for different land-use types. Moreover, uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were performed to analyse the spatial differentiation and the dominant parameters of vulnerability. Compared with two other commonly used methods, the proposed local-correlated method (LCM) is more in line with reality, and provides more reasonable information for making a better-informed decision.

AB This study proposes a general differential split-sample test (GDSST) based on an oriented bootstrap to assess the transferability of conceptual rainfall-runoff models to climatically contrasting periods. Compared to existing benchmark techniques, the GDSST allows a larger number of climatically contrasted discontinuous periods to be sampled, and is computationally more effective than the basic bootstrap to identify the most contrasted periods. When applied to three hydrological models (GR4J, HBV and IHACRES) in five catchments in northern Tunisia, the GDSST provided clear limits of the transferability of the models under changing precipitation (P) and temperature (T) conditions towards drier and hotter conditions. According to the criteria and thresholds retained, approximate limits of model transferability are drawn. The models are roughly transferable for relative changes in precipitation Delta P < (0.08 Delta T-0.18) with Delta P is an element of [-30%, +80%), and changes in temperature Delta T is an element of [-2 degrees C, + 2 degrees C). These transferability limits suggest selecting a past sub-period as close as possible to the future climate to identify calibration parameters, which can be used for hydrological projections. The limits of transferability were then compared to climate projections by eight high-resolution Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulations resulting from the EURO-CORDEX initiative. The RCMs' precipitation and temperature simulations of the historical period 1970-2000 were first assessed to select the most realistic ones for future projections. A delta-change monthly correction was used to perturb the observed climate series according to climate simulations under two Radiative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for one medium-term horizon (2040-2070) and one long-term horizon (2070-2100). The effects of the selected past calibration period on the hydrological projections were then analysed. The RCP 8.5 climate projections fall outside the limits of transferability of all rainfall-runoff models tested. Models calibrated on the whole observed period were found to underestimate the impacts of climate change on runoff by 5%-20% in comparison with models calibrated on sub-periods with mean annual P and T closer to projected climate conditions.

AB The joint spatiotemporal modeling of aquifer level fluctuations provides a significant tool in the prediction of groundwater levels at unvisited locations. Two types of variogram functions, appropriately modified to incorporate physical information, are presented and compared under Space-time Residual kriging methodology using the Bayesian Bootstrap idea to quantify uncertainty. The spatiotemporal trend is approximated using a component of physical meaning. A recently developed Spartan type non-separable variogram function employs tools of physical meaning to enhance the efficiency and reliability of spatiotemporal geostatistical modeling in groundwater applications. In addition, the product-sum space-time variogram is applied and involves in the separable variogram functions a scale factor of hydraulic conductivity directional ratio. The proposed variogram functions involve a non-Euclidean distance metric and are mathematically valid (i.e., constitutes permissible models). Herein, the efficiency of the proposed tools is tested using groundwater level data from an alluvial unconfined aquifer. Both functions provide improved results compared to those of the Space-time Ordinary kriging. Between the two, the non-separable one has the most efficient performance.

AB With increasing population and urbanization in the deltas across global mega-river basins, groundwater stress is increasing due to changing ocean-land disposition, hydroclimatic extremes, over-exploitation and natural/anthropogenic contamination. Such change in coastal hydrodynamic process makes an impact in to the resilience of groundwater-sourced drinking water vulnerability. The groundwater responses studied in this work in the ecologically-vulnerable, UNESCO World Heritage site of the Sundarbans delta-front aquifers at the river Ganges-Brahmaputra mega delta, demonstrate a unique example of such intricacies and complexities. High-resolution, temporal, depth-dependent hydraulic connectivity and hydrochemistry was studied for this complex, climate driven, tidal-induced hydrological interactions between surface water (seawater of Bay of Bengal [BoB] and Ganges river water) with shallow and deep groundwater by stable isotopic (delta O-18 and delta D) signatures and piezometry. A wide range of salinity content and delta O-18 composition of groundwater samples for 14-25 (salinity: 3-45 ppT, delta O-18: -3.63 to -1.15 parts per thousand) and 30-50 meter below ground level (mbgl) (salinity: 5-25 ppT, delta O-18: -3.41 to -1.34 parts per thousand) was recorded, while, comparatively, a narrow range of temporal variability was observed for the depths of 115 (salinity: 1-4 ppT, delta O-18: -5.04 to -2.15 parts per thousand) and 333mbgl (salinity: 1 to 3 ppT, delta O-18: -4.43 to -2.81 parts per thousand). Study results revealed that vertical transport of solute has been induced by coastal hydrodynamics. However, human interferences, in terms of groundwater abstraction and land use-land cover change (e.g. brackish aquaculture) do have substantial impact on evolving groundwater response, thereby impacting resilience to drinking water option in this densely populated area. Fluctuations of groundwater level in relation with delta O-18(gw), composition showed shallow depths (14-50 mbgl) are hydraulically connected by local flow and conducive of chemical exchanges. The deeper groundwater (115-330 mbgl depths) flow suggests regional-scale hydraulic connections along flow paths. In-spite of sub-meter scale seasonal groundwater level changes, salinity variability is observed between 1 and 4 ppT at > 100 mbgl depths, suggest mixing between chemically-distinct water reservoirs, conserving hydraulic mass-balance. However, such observation suggests severe implications for groundwater vulnerability, which might aggravate with future intensification of irrigational abstraction, as well as with changing hydroclimatological regime and extreme events. Thus, future planning and management strategies of sustainable supply of safe water in such ecologically-sensitive groundwater systems need to incorporate such dynamic chemical evolution.

AB The stable hydrogen (delta D) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotope composition of modern meteoric water are influenced by changes in global temperature, Rayleigh distillation processes, and moisture transport history. However, on a global scale the relative influence of these different meteorological variables is spatially heterogeneous. We collected daily precipitation samples from meteorological stations in the Armenian Highlands for a period of one year in order to determine the constraints on delta D and delta O-18 and relationship to broader climatic conditions. These data are coupled with HYSPLIT back-trajectory analysis to determine how these compositions relate to moisture source and transport path. Multivariate analysis shows the strongest relationship between delta D and delta O-18 and climate variables is temperature at the sampling site. Along with temperature, the intensity of the North Atlantic Oscillation, a pattern of atmospheric circulation which determines the strength and location of Northern Hemisphere midlatitude westerlies, is significant (p < 0.05) for both delta O-18 and delta D values of precipitation. This correlation between NAO and isotopes in precipitation is also observed in four nearby GNIP stations from 2008 to 2015. Negative NAO phases are associated with weakened westerlies, which allows precipitation enriched in heavy isotopes from the Mediterranean and southerly sources to penetrate into the Armenian Highlands, whereas positive NAO phases are associated with stronger westerlies bringing more negative precipitation from the Black Sea. This relationship is most significant (p < 0.001) during the winter and spring months (December to May). These data demonstrate that paleo-archives of SD and delta O-18 in the Armenian Highlands could serve as a tool to measure changes in the NAO in the past, particularly when coupled with independent measurements of temperature.

AB Knowledge of the geologic structure at a field site is a useful piece of information for hydrologic modeling since it can serve as more site-specific prior information about the hydraulic parameter patterns at the site than generic spatial statistics. Widely accepted electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) survey for mapping subsurface anomalies could be a viable tool for acquiring this information. However, their ability to delineate geologic structures has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, two-dimensional ERT numerical experiments were first conducted to study the effects of boundary conditions on the dipole-dipole and pole-pole array configurations. An ERT setup subsequently was implemented in a sandbox consisting of complex layers of different sands. A continuous copper wire was installed along the sides of the sandbox to impose potential boundaries. Using data collected with the pole-pole array in the sandbox under different degrees of drainage and the Successive Linear Estimator (SLE) algorithm, we show that ERT yields electrical conductivity estimates of complex layer structures with small uncertainties. In addition, using SLE with physically meaningful correlation scales as prior information can lead to an electrical conductivity field that is consistent with visually observed layer structures. The correlation scale concept also was demonstrated to provide guidance to the design of the electrode spacing in the surveys. Moreover, the estimated field was validated by predicting electrical potential fields from two independent ERT surveys using electrodes at different locations. Results of this study suggest that the combination of ERT and SLE is a viable geophysical survey tool for mapping geologic layer structures.
   Research Significance: This study develops a method to implement prescribed potential boundaries for enhancing the pole-pole ERT survey, illustrates the importance of correlation scales and develops an approach for validating ERT results.

AB Current precipitation measurements are conducted largely by simple automatic rain gauges. Despite being error prone and sometimes of questionable accuracy, the procedure is still widely used. In recent years new possibilities have emerged, which are based on different measuring principles. Although the application of alternative devices is increasing, its use in research is limited. In this study, precipitation measurements by different devices were compared, and systematic errors caused by individual characteristics were corrected. Data were collected by means of a monitoring network, which included a piezoelectric precipitation sensor mounted at 2.3 m, a standard tipping bucket at 1 m, and a weighable gravitation lysimeter at ground level. As measurements at ground level are considered as optimum, the records of the lysimeter were thereby determined as a reference. The results showed that precipitation measured by elevated rain gauges differed in total between -6.8% and + 35% compared to rainfall measured by the lysimeter. The records correlated well, but the analyses indicated a strong influence of the precipitation intensity on the recorded amount of precipitation. The deviations between values of the rain gauges and those of the lysimeter increased with rainfall intensity. In general, the tipping bucket demonstrated negative error values and indicated an underestimation of precipitation compared to records at ground level, whereas the piezoelectric precipitation sensor showed an overestimation by highly positive error values. A subsequent precipitation correction through the linear scaling method improved significantly the raw data of the rain gauges.

AB Accurate estimation of soil moisture content is necessary for optimal management of water and soil resources. Soil moisture is an important variable in the hydrologic cycle, which plays an important role in the global water and energy balance due to its impact on hydrological, ecological, and meteorological processes. The purpose of the present study was to explore a newly developed hybrid intelligent model for simulating soil moisture content. A hybrid adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model-grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm was designed here and validated against the neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR) and standalone ANFIS models. The models input parameters were di-electric constant, soil bulk density, clay content and organic matter of 1155 soil samples. Various statistical indices were employed to evaluate the performances of the applied models. For a reliable ranking of models, the Global Performance Indicator (GPI) was utilized, which is a 5-agent index. The results evidenced the feasibility of the developed hybrid ANFIS-GWO model with superior simulation results. At the testing stage, the MAE and SI values for the ANFIS-GWO were 1.468% and 0.098, respectively, which indicated the superiority of the ANFIS-GWO compared to the ANFIS-Fuzzy C mean (MAE = 6.427%, SI = 0.354), and ANFIS-sub clustering (MAE = 2.137%, SI = 0.141) models. Based on the GPI, the ANFIS-GWO model was ranked as the best model, followed by the standalone ANFIS and SVR models, while the worst accuracy was attained through ANN model. The ANFIS-GWO model improved the simulation accuracy by 48% and 50%, respectively, compared to the standalone ANFIS and SVR models. In addition, based on the GPI, the ANFIS-GWO model presented an enhancement of about 77 percent compared to the ANN model. The high accuracy of the ANFIS-GWO model compared to the standalone ANFIS model represents the performance of the GWO algorithm for escaping local optima, which makes the ANFIS-GWO as a powerful tool for estimating soil moisture. Overall, the explored hybrid intelligent models demonstrated a reliable pedotransfer function of soil moisture where it can contribute to several geo-sciences engineering principles.

AB Climate change and gullies (and ditches) on peatlands are well known factors altering peat hydrology. Yet, exactly how this alteration emerges from interaction of these factors with groundwater dynamics is still not fully understood. In this study, we tackled this issue by coupling field measurement with model simulation using Visual MODFLOW. Groundwater processes and the associated water budget during five months of the wet season, 2017 were examined in the Zoige peatland, located on the northeastern side of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China with elevations of 3400-3900 m. Simulations were performed for a peatland area of 3.89 x 10(4) m(2) and three sub-zones within it representing peatland with no gullies (NG), a deep gully cutting through the peat layer (CT), and a shallow gully whose bed is within the peat layer (NCT). Model input parameters were calibrated and validated using the field-measured data. Modeling outcomes led to water budget showing relative contributions of main hydrological pathways (MHPs) (i.e., precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), gully, groundwater flow, and boundary) to changes of water storage in peats (AS). Although these MHPs varied differently during rain and inter-rain periods, AS values were mainly controlled by the oscillated trend of the difference between P and ET. Variations of MHPs caused by NCT and CT were secondary to those due to those of P and ET during the wet season referred to as the short-term climate change. Vertical groundwater (VGW) flows were strongly correlated with water table (WT) levels in both rain and inter-rain periods, but their directions had different patterns in the two periods. Horizontal groundwater (HGW) flows tended to move into the deep (CT) gully, while move from the shallow (NCT) gully to the neighbor peats during both periods. Since HGW flows were about ten times greater than VGW ones, their effect on AS was significant during the long dry season. This would lead to continuous loss of groundwater stored in peats, demonstrating the coupled effect of long-term climate change and gullies on AS. These findings underline the necessity of controlling gully development and avoiding ditch excavation in future Zoige peatland management practices.

AB Unconfined aquifers sometimes overlie fractured bedrocks, consisting of unconfined-fractured aquifer systems. Pumping induced hydrodynamics in such aquifer systems has not received much attention as in other types of aquifer systems. This paper aims to obtain semi-analytical solutions of flow to a general well configuration in such an unconfined-fractured two-layer aquifer system. The examples of general well configuration, specifically discussed here, include: 1) a horizontal well, 2) a vertical well, 3) a vertical well with one horizontal collector, and 4) a vertical well with two horizontal collectors which are perpendicular with each other. The methodology is general and can be extended to other types of wells with minor modifications of solutions developed in this study. The point sink/source solution is first obtained using double infinite Fourier and Laplace transformations (where sink is for pumping and source is for injection). The line sink/source solution is then obtained via integrating the point sink/source along the desired direction and following the principle of superposition. The de Hoog numerical inverse Laplace transform and Gaussian Quadrature are used to obtain time-domain dimensionless drawdown solutions. The instantaneous drainage of water table and the inter-porosity flow of the underlying fractured aquifer are taken into account. The effects of the length of horizontal well on dimensionless drawdown and dimensionless drawdown derivative, and scaled sensitivity of the hydraulic parameters of the underlying fractured aquifer are explored. The dimensionless drawdowns and drawdown derivatives of a vertical pumping well, a vertical well with a single horizontal collector and a vertical well with two perpendicular horizontal collectors are also compared. The scaled sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to the hydraulic parameters of the underlying fractured aquifer of these different pumping well structures is explored. The results of this study can be used to evaluate the hydraulic parameters using the drawdown data collected during a pumping test performed in a general well configuration in a unconfined-fractured two-layer aquifer system. Furthermore, the presented solutions can be utilized to design the pumping well to minimize drawdown in low permeability or thin aquifers. By eliminating the inter-porosity flow term from the underlying fractured aquifer, the solutions are applicable to groundwater flow to a pumping well in leaky aquifers.

AB Irrespective of the magnitude and spatial extend, the consequences of a natural hazard are strongly connected to the vulnerability of elements at risk (e.g. people, buildings and infrastructure). It is, therefore, obvious that an analysis and quantification of vulnerability is required for successful disaster risk reduction. The need for vulnerability assessment is crucial due to the effects of climate change as well as the socio-economic dynamics that may directly impact vulnerabilities and coping capacities of affected communities. Vulnerability is multidimensional (physical, social, economic, etc.), however, the dimension which is mainly related to the direct costs and threat to human lives is the physical one. We focus here on the physical vulnerability of buildings subject to torrential hazards occurring in small and steep mountain catchments. These processes include fluvial sediment transport, debris floods, and debris flows. Furthermore, we included flash flood hazards if these are related to torrential catchments. Physical vulnerability to torrential hazards in mountain areas is a topic that has been under scientific investigation over the last 20 years. Several methods to assess physical vulnerability of buildings towards flash floods, debris flows and hyper-concentrated flows can be found in the literature. The plethora of methods and approaches may be classified under the following three categories: vulnerability matrices, vulnerability curves and vulnerability indices. We provide a short review of these methods which became available over the last decade and which dominate the scientific debate in mountain hazard risk management, giving an emphasis to vulnerability curves. The approaches presented herein are highlighted through case studies from the European Alps and beyond. Furthermore, challenges in vulnerability assessment including data requirements, need for improved event documentation, uncertainties and challenges related to future climate and socio-economic changes are outlined. Finally, a discussion on progress-driving factors such as new technologies (e.g. mobile apps, drones), citizen science and new innovative assessment methods is provided.

AB We present a novel ensemble extension of the conditional bias-penalized Kalman filter, referred to herein as the conditional bias-penalized ensemble Kalman filter (CBEnKF), and apply it to flood forecasting. The CBEnKF differs from most data assimilation (DA) techniques in that it minimizes a weighted sum of the error variance and the expected value of the Type-II conditional bias squared for improved estimation and prediction of extremes. To assess the ability of the CBEnKF to improve flood prediction, we carried out real-world DA experiments in which the CBEnKF and the EnKF were applied under identical conditions for assimilation of hourly streamflow observations into the lumped Sacramento soil moisture accounting and unit hydrograph models. Ten headwater basins in Texas, whose drainage areas and times-to-peak range from 137 to 1037 km(2) and from 3 to 21 hrs, respectively, were used in the twin experiments. All events in a 10-yr period with peak flow exceeding 100 m(3)/s were used. Verification of the ensemble mean predictions indicates that the CBEnKF improves the multi-basin mean of the mean square error skill score over the EnKF by about 0.15 over lead times of up to the time-to-peak of the basin. Verification of the ensemble predictions indicates that the CBEnKF improves the mean continuous ranked probability skill score by about 0.2 on average over the EnKF for all ranges of flow within the significant events, and by about 0.3 for flows exceeding the 95th percentile in those events. That the gain in skill is larger for larger flows makes the CBEnKF very appealing despite the significantly higher computational cost.

AB Damming is one of the major methods that human being secure reliable freshwater. It can change flow magnitude and regime along a river, particularly for Transboundary Rivers shared by multiple jurisdictions. This study develops a coupled framework to assess both the current and future cumulative impacts of damming on downstream water availability for data-sparse regions like the Tibetan Plateau. The framework is applied to the Brahmaputra River Basin (BRB), where dam developments on the Tibetan Plateau are highly concerned. The results show that, despite being part of the 'Asian water tower', the Yarlung Tsangpo River (YTR) contributes just 15-16% to Brahmaputra streamflow, for 48% of its contributing area. We found that the maximum impact due to five recently constructed dams in YTR suggests about 8-11% reduction of mean annual streamflow at outlet of Brahmaputra River. The impacts of damming would be largely offset by runoff increases under the climate scenarios projected by 28 CMIP5 model outputs from RCP4.5 median-level emission scenarios and 29 CMIP5 model outputs from RCP8.5 high-level emission scenarios for the period of 2049 to 2075, compared to the historical period of 1979 to 2005. Our results suggest that it is necessary to use our framework or a similar one to comprehensively evaluate the maximum possible damming impact across the Transboundary Rivers.

AB This paper focuses on water allocation in an irrigation district considering water rights transaction. The relationship between the reservoir authority and the sub-area managers is explored based on a novel Stackelberg-Nash-Cournot equilibrium model. In this framework, the reservoir authority has higher priority in allocating initial water rights to Sancha town, Danjing and Xinmin villages; after get the decisions from the reservoir authority, the sub-area managers decide water distribution to multi-crops planting areas and water rights transaction with the promise of Nash-Cournot equilibrium, then the reservoir authority can modify his decision by Stackelberg strategic interaction. To obtain the optimal irrigation strategy, fuzzy goal programming and genetic algorithm methods are applied. In this context, a Stackelberg-Nash-Cournot equilibrium solution can be obtained. The proposed model is applied to Sancha irrigation area, and the results show that more available water can be distributed in Sancha town while guaranteeing the equity among the sub-areas in this irrigation district; more water was utilized for wheat and oilseed rape than paddy and bean, which matched the fact that wheat and oilseed rape grow in quarters with relatively less rainfall inflows. A changeable and uncertain environment, regarding inflow levels, planting areas, and irrigation coefficient, take potential challenges to agricultural irrigation process. Hence, to cope with the challenges, cope with the future uncertainty and offer more information on the adjustment of agricultural irrigation patterns, scenario technique is applied by changing the three parameters inflow levels, planting areas, and irrigation coefficient respectively. Finally, to highlight the superiority of the proposed model, a comparative analysis is conducted in a situation without considering the water market, which verifies the importance and effectiveness of water rights transaction.

AB Chinese cities have been experiencing unprecedented growth for over three decades and the resulting urbanization is having a remarkable impact on the hydrological cycle at the local and regional scale. This study therefore examined the influence of urbanization on nonstationarity of annual and seasonal precipitation extremes in China, using daily precipitation data from 1857 stations for 1961-2014, and NCAR/NCEP and ERA Interim reanalysis datasets. Results of trend, change point, and bootstrap analyses revealed that urban signatures on long-term changes (i.e. trends and magnitudes) of precipitation extremes were not prominently visible at the national scale. However, a nonstationary frequency analysis of precipitation extremes by a Generalized Additive Model for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) framework with a cluster of 66 models showed that urbanization caused nonstationarity in precipitation extremes at local and regional scales, such as North China. Further, significant nonstationarity tended to occur more in urbanizing areas than in rural and urbanized areas, suggesting that land use/land cover (LULC) transition (i.e. rural areas turning into urban areas) played an important role in introducing nonstationarity. Furthermore, analysis of large-scale circulation patterns, using k-mean clustering, showed that urban signatures on extremes were not prominent at the national scale but at the regional scale. Further studies are needed to enumerate physical mechanisms causing the impact of local environmental changes on precipitation extremes at different geographical locations over China.

AB Groundwater capture and storage loss play a major role in the sustainable exploitation of a regional aquifer. This study aimed to identify the impact of major and long-term groundwater exploitation on a regional aquifer system to understand the processes controlling the sustainable exploitation of the transboundary Milk River Aquifer (MRA). The MRA extends over 26,300 km(2), being a major water resource across southern Alberta (Canada) and northern Montana (USA). Concerns about the sustainability of the MRA were raised as the century-old exploitation has led to important drawdowns and the local loss of historical artesian conditions. A steady-state numerical model of the regional flow system was developed and calibrated against hydraulic heads, groundwater fluxes, and the area with flowing artesian wells. Four groundwater abstraction scenarios were simulated: 1) natural flow conditions without exploitation; 2) the mean abstraction rate over the last 108 years; 3) the historical maximum global abstraction rate of the MRA; and 4) a theoretical high abstraction rate based on the maximum rate estimated for each MRA exploitation zone. The numerical model agrees with the previously formulated conceptual model and supports its hydraulic plausibility. Results show that MRA exploitation has led to a major change in flow patterns to sustain groundwater abstraction. The MRA water balance under exploitation indicates that more recharge and reduced seepage to bedrock valleys compensate groundwater withdrawals. Based on its impact on regional discharge and the reduction in MRA storage, the mean historical level of exploitation of the MRA appears sustainable. Larger exploitation rates would significantly reduce groundwater discharge to surface seepage locations and lead to a larger reduction in groundwater storage in the MRA. Modeling also illustrates that the MRA is an internationally shared resource. This situation would justify a joint management of the aquifer system between Canada and USA; especially in the area comprised between the recharge area in Montana and the Canadian reach of the Milk River.

AB The lack of stream gauging data worldwide has inspired an abundance of methods attempting to predict the complex natural process of streamflow. A set of traditional regression equations have been developed by the U.S. Geological Survey for the state of Iowa. However, several inconsistencies were noted, including irregular region definition and varying input parameters between regions. To overcome the common problems faced in modelling, and to combat the irregularities in the regression equations, a new Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) algorithm has been proposed using a combination of the classical combinatorial GMDH and multilayer GMDH to predict the 2-year peak flow. Data from 365 stream gauges located in the state of Iowa were used in the model development. The new algorithm was compared to the two classical algorithms and the traditional linear regression equations developed by the U.S. Geological Survey. The new algorithm which requires fewer input parameters without relying on regionalization was found to be the best method. The developed algorithm is based on a more robust hydrologic theory and therefore is a reliable method for predicting the 2-year peak flow for ungauged basins. The two main hypotheses inspired by the past regression equations and suggested in this study were that regionalization is not necessary and that using fewer input parameters to avoid redundancy still produces a robust prediction method. This study has developed a novel and reliable prediction method for peak flow prediction at ungauged basins while advancing insight into the most influential variables governing the magnitude of the flow.

AB Dam-break flows in both triangular and rectangular channels are investigated experimentally in the present study. Laboratory measurements are carried out in a prismatic and smooth flume with a horizontal and wet bed for two different reservoir heads and four tailwater levels. During the experiments, digital image processing is applied as a flow measurement technique. Both water surface profiles and stage hydrographs are obtained effectively by means of video images with eight adjacent cameras. The dam-break flows in triangular and rectangular channels show common features: jet formation in the downstream of the dam during the initial dam break stage; similarity of the water surface profiles behind the dam for different depth ratios at a specific time; insignificant effects of the depth ratio on the negative wave front; and strong dependence of the shock wave front on the depth ratio. In a triangular channel, the negative wave front moves slower than that in a rectangular channel; and extra negative waves propagating towards upstream direction does not form for all depth ratios considered in this study while they have been observed in a rectangular channel for large values of a representing the ratio of initial tailwater depth and reservoir depth (i.e., alpha = 0.3 and 0.4). Meantime, these extra negative waves result in an undulation of the water surface profile in the reservoir and an apparent increase of water depth at the dam. The water depth at the dam section for different depth ratios is 60-70% of the initial reservoir head; and the shock wave front propagates slower as the depth ratio increases for the triangular channel. For water depth ratios alpha = 0.1 and 0.2, the shock wave front moves faster than that in a rectangular channel, and the contrary is true for alpha = 0.4. For alpha = 0.3, the propagation speed of the shock wave front approximates that in a rectangular channel. Present study contributes to the understanding of the effect of wet downstream conditions on dam-break flows in triangular channels and provides detailed experimental data for validating both the analytical and the numerical solutions.

AB Among different sources of uncertainty in hydrologic modeling (i.e., model structure, parameter estimation, input data, etc.), consecutive error reduction of model initial conditions can prevent a model from drifting away from reality and consequently improving model estimates. Most approaches that evaluated the correction of initial conditions through data assimilation (DA) have focused on improving hydrologic model simulations (i.e., under observed forcings) rather than evaluating the model performance in a forecasting context. This paper investigates the utility of Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) data assimilation in which available observed streamflow is exploited to update state variables of a conceptual water balance model for forecasting monthly streamflow over 340 rainfall-dominated river basins across the contiguous United States (CONUS). Our results demonstrate that after EnKF application, streamflow simulation skill improves in terms of both Relative Root Mean Square Error (R-RMSE) and correlation coefficient (CC) for almost 90% of the selected river basins. Evaluating the model performance under different flow conditions shows that EnKF has stronger positive effect on monthly low flow predictions comparing to monthly high flows particularly during the summer season. The utility of EnKF is also assessed in the context of 1-month ahead streamflow forecasting. Due to the updated model initial conditions, streamflow forecasts are improved throughout the year even though the skill in hydrologic forecasts is predominantly dependent on the accuracy of precipitation forecasts.

AB In some countries the spent nuclear fuel produced by nuclear power plants will be deposited in crystalline granitic rock formations. In Finland, a repository for the spent nuclear fuel is being built at Olkiluoto. The safety assessment of the repository requires a careful determination of the transport properties of the bedrock. The porosity of the bedrock and the effective diffusion coefficients and distribution coefficients of different radio-nuclides for the bedrock are used as the main parameters in the safety assessment calculations. It has been questioned whether the parameters determined using laboratory experiments can be used to estimate the parameters in the in situ conditions. In this study, laboratory and in situ water phase diffusion experiments (WPDEs) were performed to resolve the issue. In the experiments, the transport of tritiated water (HTO), Cl-36, and Na-22 was studied using similar experimental setups. Mathematical models were constructed and solved to determine the transport parameters from the measured breakthrough curves. On average, the in situ WPDEs resulted in 20 (+/- 6)% smaller porosities and 32 (+/- 10)% smaller effective diffusion coefficients for HTO and Cl-36 than the laboratory WPDEs. It was also found that in veined gneiss, the most dominant rock type of the Olkiluoto bedrock, anion exclusion reduced the retention parameters of Cl-36 compared with those of HTO. Furthermore, the distribution coefficient of Na-22 for veined gneiss was about one order of magnitude smaller in the in situ conditions than in previous laboratory batch sorption experiments.

AB Weather generators (WGs) are tools that create synthetic weather data, which are statistically similar to the observed data. Considering the limitations of most rainfall generators to preserve satisfactorily the fundamental statistical properties (e.g., spatial and temporal coherence) simultaneously, we propose a new framework for multisite rainfall generation. The framework consists of three main components: (1) a spatiotemporal rainfall field, described as spatial modes and their corresponding temporal evolution based on empirical orthogonal function analysis (EOFA). (2) The time series of these spatial modes, decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with characteristic frequencies (periods) using Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). (3) Stochastic simulation (SS), achieved by assigning random phases for the specific IMFs. The current model, EHS (EOFA + HHT + SS), is compared with two other typical multi-site rainfall generators, MulGETS (parametric model) and KNN (non-parametric model) for a network of 12 stations in Xiang River basin, China. These three models are assessed based on their ability to simulate sequences with statistical attributes that are similar to those observed. We compare the basic statistics (mean, standard deviation, skewness), extreme value characteristics (95th percentile and maximum), spatial dependence (spatial correlation and spatial continuity ratio), and temporal dependence statistic (autocorrelation, wet/dry spells, and low-frequency variability). The results show that EHS rainfall generator has a similar capacity as KNN model in reproducing the spatial structure of the original rainfall field, and has a greater ability than MulGETS and KNN model to preserve the historical temporal statistics, especially the autocorrelation at various time scales and low-frequency variability. Overall, EHS is a useful model for generating realistic multi-site rainfall field and can be expected to generate plausible scenarios for impact studies.

TI An ensemble neural network model for real-time prediction of urban

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Artificial neural network; Ensemble neural network; Real-time forecast;
   Urban flooding
AB The real-time forecasting of urban flooding is a challenging task for the following two reasons: (1) urban flooding is often characterized by short lead times, (2) the uncertainty in precipitation forecasting is usually high. Standard physically based numerical models are often too slow for the use in real-time forecasting systems. Data driven models have small computational costs and fast computation times and may be useful to overcome this problem. The present study presents an artificial neural network based model for the prediction of maximum water levels during a flash flood event. The challenge of finding a suitable structure for the neural network was solved with a new growing algorithm. The model is successfully tested for spatially uniformly distributed synthetic rain events in two real but slightly modified urban catchments with different surface slopes. The computation time of the model in the order of seconds and the accuracy of the results are convincing, which suggest that the method may be useful for real-time forecasts.

AB Intertidal wetlands are widely considered to be vulnerable to storm impacts. While much attention has been given to the effect of hurricane/typhoon landfall on local erosion/deposition in intertidal wetlands, less is known about how distant hurricanes/typhoons can affect an intertidal wetland or about the comprehensive effects of hurricanes/typhoons on hydrodynamics, sediment transport and seabed stability. Here, we investigate the possible impacts of thirteen typhoons that occurred in the western Pacific during summer autumn 2016 on an intertidal wetland in the Yangtze Delta. We detected the impacts from eight of the typhoons during half of their duration when these typhoons were 450-2000 km away (nearest distance ever for each typhoon) from the delta. These remote typhoons caused 2-5 times maximum increases in hydrodynamics and suspended sediment concentration. Correspondingly, considerable net mudflat erosion and marsh deposition were observed. We therefore conclude that intertidal wetlands can be strongly affected by typhoons, even those passing by hundreds of kilometres away. These findings contribute to understand how far and in what extent hurricanes/typhoons can affect intertidal wetlands and to increase knowledge needed for coastal management.

AB This study investigates moisture origin, characteristics and intra-event scale variability of the isotopic signature of rainfall in a Mediterranean mountain area, based on data from the Vallcebre Research Catchments, NE Spain. Weekly data and samples were used to analyse the general dynamics of the isotopic composition of precipitation and its relationship with meteorological variables at the sampling site. Then, based on the data and samples available at the intra-event scale, the variability of the isotopic signature during rainfall events was characterised and an explanation of what caused the observed variability was attempted. Results at the weekly time scale show that the maximum relative deviation of the heavy isotopic content with respect to Standard Mean Ocean Water (delta O-18) of the precipitation signature occurred during summer months and, in contrast, the minimum during winter months. The intra-annual trend of rainfall delta O-18 roughly followed the mean monthly air temperature. Using intra-event information, three main types of delta O-18 isotopic trends were found during rainfall events: most of the events had a V-shaped isotopic trend, followed by L-shaped and constant trend events. Changes in moisture sources 'diagnosed using a Lagrangian approach and a previously existing contribution algorithm' were one of the causes of the isotopic variability and changes at the intra-event scale, but these may also have been influenced by sub-cloud processes that modified the isotopic signature. Moisture sources for analysed events showed the main influence of the Mediterranean area, but also an important influence of the Atlantic Basin.

AB Advances in sensor technologies provide the potential for real-time monitoring of soil moisture status. Little work has been conducted to study the spatial and temporal variations of soil water content at the field scale and the interactions between soil water content and environmental controlling factors in cropped fields during the growing season. In this study, we assessed the spatial and temporal variations of surface soil water content (0-0.1 m) using seven in-situ soil moisture probes and Sentinel-1 satellite data over the 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons in irrigated fields of the Central Sands Plains, Wisconsin, USA. An empirical multiple linear regression model was developed between the soil water content with Sentinel-1 backscatter data. The model was evaluated with leave-one-group-out cross-validation, which showed an R-2 of 0.60, mean error of -0.00 m(3) m(-3), root mean square error of 0.02 m(3) m(-3), and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient of 0.75. Soil volumetric water content (VWC) and soil water deficit (SWD) were mapped at 30-m resolution every 6-12 days across one field (DU field at the Wallendal farm). Using two statistical metrics ("first metric" and "last metric") and a bootstrapping approach, the location-specific and time-dependent interactions between estimated soil water content and environmental controlling factors across the DU field during the cropping season were evaluated, and it was found that such interactions were affected by initial soil water content and plant stress status. The robustness of the model needs to be improved in the future by collecting more VWC measurements in different soil and crop conditions. The method has the potential to provide a baseline soil moisture map and can be coupled with mechanistic models and subsoil VWC measurements for improved irrigation management and water use efficiency under a changing climate.

AB There has been a series of water resource problems, such as imbalances of the water supply and demand and serious water pollution, in China. It is important for the Chinese government to formulate a sustainable development strategy for water resources and to effectively guarantee the national water resource security. This paper divides the comprehensive carrying capacity of water resources into the following three aspects: the water resource balance capacity, the water resource pressure and driving force, and the water resource development and utilization capacity. Taking 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of China as research objects, the catastrophe progression method is adopted to evaluate the comprehensive carrying capacity of interprovincial water resources in China from 2010 to 2016. The direct effects and spatial spillover effects of different factors on water resources are discussed by constructing a spatial Durbin model (SDM). The results show that there are obvious spatial differences in the water resource balance ability, pressure and driving force, and development and utilization ability. The spatial distribution follows a decreasing trend from east to west and from south to north. The water supply, water demand, investment in environmental management, economic development and balance of the ecosystem have obvious direct effects on the carrying capacity of water resources. The spatial spillover effect of the water supply and demand, energy consumption, the proportion of protected areas and the newly increased areas of soil erosion control are significant and will have a strong impact on the water resource carrying capacity of surrounding areas. The conclusion of this paper can provide a reference for the government in making water resource management policies.

AB Geometric characteristics and Manning's roughness coefficient (n) are needed in steady and unsteady flow analysis in open channels and rivers. Various methods are used to estimate n of a river reach while there is always some uncertainty in its estimation. One of the methods for estimating n is its calibration using observed inflow and outflow hydrographs in a river reach. This calibration procedure is conducted by adjusting n such that the outflow hydrograph calculated by an adopted flow routing model matches the observed outflow hydrograph. The available calibration methods usually consider a uniform roughness along the reach of a river. In this study, a new method for calibration of n is presented that can recognize different regions with different n in a river reach even when only one recorded inflow and corresponding outflow hydrographs are available. In the proposed method, at first different cases are generated where, in each case, the river reach is divided into several sub-reaches in a systematic procedure. Then for each case, the n of all sub-reaches are optimized by using the Monte Carlo method and random search optimization. In the next step, the best case among all cases is identified by applying similarity criteria defined in this study. Finally, a clustering method is employed to identify different regions with different n values for the selected best case.

AB Karst features in limestone aquifers often exhibit highly heterogeneous patterns, which are strongly governed by structural complexities such as the spatial distribution and organization of fractures in natural carbonate rocks. However, until now, little is known about the impact of structural complexity on karstification processes. In this paper, we use numerical models to investigate how structural heterogeneity affects the generation of incipient karst in natural fractured systems. We develop a numerical model which couples the processes of fluid flow, mass transport and dissolution kinetics that govern the growth of fracture aperture, based on discrete fracture networks. We apply the model to simulate conduit evolution in a natural joint network that displays a distinctive topological pattern. A wide range of hydraulic gradient and initial fracture aperture is considered. Our results show that the network topology may generate a significant impact on dissolution pattern depending on how flow is organized within the discrete network. If a channelized structure occurs in the flow network, the dissolution pattern depends highly on the initial hydrogeological settings, while if the flow network consists of branched segments, a similar dissolution pattern emerges for a broad range of initial hydrogeological settings. When the flow direction is normal to the persisting fracture orientation, intermittent interruptions to the positive feedback process between flow and dissolution occur. Therefore, the breakthrough is delayed. We discuss the link between our results of dissolution modeling in fracture networks to previous modelling efforts in the context of single rough fractures and fracture network formed by orthogonal fracture sets.

AB River bathymetry, which is vital for accurate hydraulic modeling, is not readily available at large scales because of the logistical difficulties in field surveys and uncertainties associated with remote sensing techniques. Several studies have explored the potential of conceptual models and interpolation algorithms to estimate bathymetry. These models have certain underlying assumptions that limit their accuracy and widespread implementation. This study aims to provide insights into the choice of bathymetric model for different hydraulic applications by analyzing the effect of different bathymetric models on hydraulic modeling under different geomorphologic and flow settings. This study does not aim to reinforce the importance of bathymetry, rather its objective is to identify the bathymetric properties that are critical to accurate estimation of different hydraulic outputs. The study accomplishes its objectives by implementing three different bathymetric models with varying cost and efficiency at four sites with diverse bathymetric characteristics. Five hydraulic outputs, namely wetted cross-sectional area, water surface elevation, inundation extents, velocity and shear are estimated at three characteristic low and high flows and the results from the four sites are grouped together to perform an unbiased and robust evaluation. The performance of these models is evaluated using the best available bathymetric representation generated from detailed field surveys as a benchmark. The results indicate that 1D flood modeling is somewhat insensitive to channel shape as long as the estimated shape reflects the channel storage accurately. Velocity and shear related applications should incorporate bathymetry that represent both the cross-sectional area and channel thalweg accurately. Reaches with low sinuosity (< 1.5), or small width and depth can be modeled reasonably using simple geometric shapes, whereas for larger streams, interpolation of surveyed data along the thalweg or complex bathymetric models that account for river anisotropy, are recommended.

AB Here, we propose a new alternative machine learning method that combines the advantage of the Random Vector Functional Link Network (RVFL) with Moth Search Algorithm (MSA) to predict the missing values of total algal count during water quality monitoring of surface waters that providing drinking water treatment plants in Fayoum, Egypt. Total of 34 water quality parameters was measured in 270 water samples during the period 2015-2017. The MSA algorithm was used for optimal selection of input features to improve the performance of the RVFL. The predicted missing values of the total algal count, by the proposed MSA-RVFL method, were strongly correlated with the real observed ones. The results of the MSA-RVFL were better than the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) models at different sizes of training tests. Compared with GA-RVFL and PSO-RVFL methods, using the MSA-RVFL was relevant to minimize the input variables and to reduce the processing time. The MSA-RVFL model could reduce the number of input variables from thirty-four to eighteen and eventually to four variables. The most significant variables selected by the MSA-RVFL to predict the total algal count were pH, NO3, P and Ca. Based on these four variables, the predicted values of algae were significantly matching with the real observations (R-2 = 0.9594). Accordingly, this makes the MSA-RVFL model to be a useful cost-efficient tool during water quality monitoring programs. Finally, the MSA-RVFL showed higher performance whenever the number of inputs is large or small that gives our suggested method more advantages than the traditional ANN models.

AB Flooding is a very common natural hazard that causes catastrophic effects worldwide. Recently, ensemble-based techniques have become popular in flood susceptibility modelling due to their greater strength and efficiency in the prediction of flood locations. Thus, the aim of this study was to employ machine learning-based Reduced-error pruning trees (REPTree) with Bagging (Bag-REPTree) and Random subspace (RS-REPTree) ensemble frameworks for spatial prediction of flood susceptibility using a geographic information system (GIS). First, a flood spatial database was constructed with 363 flood locations and thirteen flood influencing factors, namely altitude, slope angle, slope aspect, curvature, stream power index (SPI), sediment transport index (STI), topographic wetness index (TWI), distance to rivers, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil, land use, lithology, and rainfall. Subsequently, correlation attribute evaluation (CAE) was used as the factor selection method for optimization of input factors. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, standard error (SE), confidence interval (CI) at 95%, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to validate and compare the performance of the models. Results show that the RS-REPTree model has the highest prediction capability for flood susceptibility assessment, with the highest area under (the ROC) curve (AUC) value (0.949, 0.907), the smallest SE (0.011, 0.023), and the narrowest CI (95%) (0.928-0.970, 0.863-0.952) for the training and validation datasets. It was followed by the Bag-REPTree and REPTree models, respectively. The results also proved the superiority of the ensemble method over using these methods individually.

AB Poljes are large flat closed depressions that can be found in most karst areas around the world. They are prone to regular flooding, which occurs after abundant rainfall or snowmelt events. The floods can form several meters deep intermittent lakes that can persist for months. Human settlements around poljes have been traditionally positioned above the level of the most severe floods. However, many neighbouring villages expanded during the last decades to areas that might be endangered by large flood events. In addition, a recent study has shown that several poljes encountered floods of more severe amplitude in mid-Holocene due to a prevailing humid climate. As current knowledge of polje's hydrology appears to be still insufficient, further research is needed. This work aims to identify the factors controlling polje flooding and evaluates their impact on the flood amplitude and duration. To do so, a list of parameters potentially controlling flooding is established. The relevance of each parameter is tested by using two idealized numerical models. The first one considers exclusively the polje from the springs to the ponors, whereas the second integrates the aquifer adjacent to the polje outflow side. First results show the usefulness of simple numerical models to identify the effect of each parameter on the flood amplitude and duration. The findings are combined to simulate a flood of medium intensity and long duration that occurred on a typical polje. A comparison of the results with real data demonstrates that the aquifer draining the polje needs to be considered to understand properly the flooding dynamics. The approach presented within this work has the potential to be used in other poljes encountering similar hydrological situations, but also lays foundation for flooding modelling in other karst areas.

AB As a non-structural river basin management option, development of a reliable inflow forecasting system using the hydrological models is essential to aid in real-time reservoir operation. For real-time streamflow forecasting, this study evaluates the capability of the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) in integration with the linear AutoRegressive (ARu), AutoRegressive Moving Average with eXogenous inputs (ARMAXu), nonlinear static wavelet-based neural network (WNNu), and dynamic wavelet-based Non-linear AutoregRessive with eXogenous inputs (WNARXu) variants of error-correction sub-models in comparison with the predictions by the standalone VIC model forced with European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) and ERA-Interim reanalysis products. These VIC-standalone, VIC-ARu, VIC-ARMAXu, VIC-WNNu, and VIC-WNARXu frameworks are field-tested for 1- to 5-days lead-time streamflow forecasting in the Hirakud reservoir catchment of the Mahanadi River basin in eastern India. The performance evaluation measures and quantile regression (QR)-based predictive uncertainty (PU) analysis reveal that the VIC-WNARXu model is the best approach for short to medium range flood forecasting with up to 7 days lead-time having the potential to be used in other world-river basins as a component of the early flood warning system.

AB Recently accrued attention has been given to machine learning approaches for flooding prediction. However, most of these studies focused mainly on time-series flooding prediction at specified sensors, rarely on spatio-temporal prediction of inundations. In this work, an integrated long short-term memory (LSTM) and reduced order model (ROM) framework has been developed. This integrated LSTM-ROM has the capability of representing the spatio-temporal distribution of floods since it takes advantage of both ROM and LSTM. To reduce the dimensional size of large spatial datasets in LSTM, the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and singular value decomposition (SVD) approaches are introduced. The LSTM training and prediction processes are carried out over the reduced space. This leads to an improvement of computational efficiency while maintaining the accuracy. The performance of the LSTM-ROM developed here has been evaluated using Okushiri tsunami as test cases. The results obtained from the LSTM-ROM have been compared with those from the full model (Fluidity). In predictive analytics, it is shown that the results from both the full model and LSTM-ROM are in a good agreement whilst the CPU cost using the LSTM-ROM is decreased by three orders of magnitude compared to full model simulations. Additionally, prescriptive analytics has been undertaken to estimate the uncertainty in flood induced conditions. Given the time series of the free surface height at a specified detector, the corresponding induced wave conditions along the coastline have then been provided using the LSTM network. Promising results indicate that the use of LSTM-ROM can provide the flood prediction in seconds, enabling us to provide real-time predictions and inform the public in a timely manner, reducing injuries and fatalities.

AB Precise estimation of flow conveyance in a two-stage open channel with vegetated floodplains is a key prerequisite to the management of the river ecosystem and the creation of flood retention space. The presence of vegetation alters the structure of water flow and affects the discharge in a two-stage channel. Nevertheless, the effect of vegetation on flow conveyance is not studied separately in the previous flow discharge research. By conducting force analysis in a control volume with considering the vegetation drag force and quantifying the energy loss caused by vegetation blocking effect and the transverse velocity gradient, this paper proposes a new method to estimate flow conveyance in compound channel covered with vegetation based on the relationship which is the total energy loss is balanced by the total energy supplied by the local flow. Experimental data series are collected to verify the new method by comparing the measured and estimated discharges and it presents a good accuracy with 2.47% relative error. The new method is also compared with the other methods, which quantify the additional resistance of vegetation by using the equivalent Manning's roughness coefficient. The results indicate that both the vegetation drag force and the equivalent Manning's roughness coefficient can be used in flow conveyance estimation and dominantly influence the accuracy of the predictive method so that they need to be properly quantified and calibrated. And adopting the vegetation drag force is suggested here for the simplicity of calculation.

AB Soil hydraulic properties are frequently obtained from evaporation experiments. Different methods exist to infer soil hydraulic properties from these experiments. Commonly proposed is the 'direct method' (or 'Simplified Evaporation Method') by which soil hydraulic properties are calculated analytically. An alternative is given by inverse parameter optimization (Inverse method'). Although soil hydraulic properties are frequently estimated by the 'direct method', only very few studies have focused on the question how accurate derived parameters can reproduce laboratory measurements. This can be achieved by modeling the water flow with a processed based numerical forward model, e.g. with HYDRUS-1D. Here, we applied the 'direct method' and 'inverse method' to a large dataset of evaporation experiments on 431 organic soil samples. The derived soil hydraulic parameters were used in HYDRUS-1D simulations and their performance in reproducing measured states and fluxes was compared. As an additional analysis, we tested how water contents at the permanent wilting point can aid stabilizing parameter estimation by adding information on water retention in the dry range. For all methods, soil hydraulic properties were determined with the soil hydraulic functions of van Genuchten-Mualem and Peters-Dumer-Iden.
   The results show that parameters derived with the 'direct method' do often not well reproduce measured pressure heads over the complete pressure head range of the evaporation experiments when they were used for HYDRUS-1D simulations (mean objective function value 0.05831). Parameters derived by the 'inverse method' provided a better performance in the HYDRUS-1D simulations if the full pressure head range of the evaporation experiments was considered (mean objective function value 0.00099), but a weaker performance when focusing on wet conditions (pressure heads > - 100 cm). Constraining the 'inverse method' by additional soil moisture measurements at permanent wilting point improved the prediction of the soil moisture at dry conditions. For the full pressure head range, the hydraulic functions of Peters-Durner-Iden performed better than the ones of van Genuchten-Mualem.

AB In order to deepen our understanding of water environment-related issues in the central Tianshan Mountains (TCTMs), it is necessary to study the change processes of hydrological variables and the underlying mechanisms within a longer time window that goes beyond the instrumental period. This study focuses on a high-resolution lacustrine sediment core drilled from an alpine lake in TCTMs with a hope that palaeohydrological changes inferred from diatom assemblages may provide an insight on details of water environment evolutions. The diatom inferred temperature was broadly consistent with the temperature records in its adjacent areas, representing a temperature trough during similar to 1490 to similar to 1835 CE and a general rising trend since similar to 1835 CE. The diatom inferred pH (DI-pH) was generally low during similar to 1490 to similar to 1835 CE, and was high with a declined trend during similar to 1835 to similar to 2013 CE, being negatively correlated with TN or TOC and positively correlated with carbonate in sediments significantly. The diatom inferred conductivity (DI-Cond) was characterized with a significantly high salinity interval during similar to 1490 to similar to 1835 CE than that during similar to 1835 to similar to 2013 CE. The salinity during the past similar to 520 years was modulated by interplays among precipitation driven by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillations, temperature-dictated evaporation, and temperature-led glacier melting. The water environment changes (lakewater temperature, DI-pH, DI-Cond and diatom assemblages) were identified with a remarkable shift at similar to 1835 CE when the temperature began to climb up in TCTMs, implying that climate warming not only exerted influences on water resources but also on water properties in TCTMs.

AB Complex interactions among organic contaminant, soil and water change the electrical properties of the subsurface often causing strong self-potential (SP) anomalies, whose monitoring is proposed as a useful tool to determine the temporal evolution of the contaminant plumes. In the present study, we focus on the problem of organic contaminant transport related to olive oil mill wastes (OOMWs), which represent an important environmental problem in Mediterranean countries. The diffusion of the contaminants into the subsurface is studied by using a global optimization procedure on SP data measured, at different times, in a well-studied contaminated pilot area located next to the Keritis river in western Crete island (Greece). Despite the complex hydrogeological conditions related to the proximity to both the Keritis river and a small seasonal stream, the analysis of five SP datasets acquired along the same profile shows that the proposed hybrid Genetic-Price algorithm is able to reproduce the main features of the SP signals, thus identifying probable multiple SP anomaly sources and their changes over time. In particular, preferential horizontal pathways of OOMW and their migration in the vadose zone during the summer season were identified, providing some useful insights for future planning of remediation actions.

AB In an alluvial river, various kinds of river regulation engineering are usually constructed along the reach for the stability of channel regime and the safety of flood control, which greatly affects the process of channel evolution. Therefore, a one-dimensional (1D) morphodynamic model has been improved to simulate the fluvial processes influenced by large-scale river regulation works. In the refined model, each node of a cross-section was labeled using a specified point code representing the zones of floodplain and main-channel with or without regulation engineering, and sediment transport and bed deformation in different zones were treated separately. In the zones without regulation engineering, both bed deposition and bed erosion were permitted to occur; in the zones with regulation works, bed deposition was allowed, while bed erosion was not permitted to occur owing to the restriction of those engineering, unless there was a deposition layer newly formed over the previous simulation period. Then the improved model was calibrated and verified using field observations through the application to a 347-km-long alluvial channel located in the Middle Yangtze River in China. The results for the year 2016 show that the channel scour volume without the effect of river regulation works was 9% greater than the measured value (34.43 x 10(6) t), while the outcome considering this effect (35.81 x 10(6) t) was in closer agreement with the measurements. Moreover, the variation in channel geometry obtained from the improved model agreed better with the observed data. River regulation works would limit the channel incision, and it is likely to scour the other unprotected bed of a cross-section or the downstream cross-sections as the flow cannot carry enough sediment from the protected bed. Simulated results indicate that part of the main-channel zone at the Jing65 section was protected, but the riverbed continued to incise by about 0.68 m in the protected area when the effect of bed-protection works was not considered in the model, which was not in accord with the observed channel geometry. Therefore, this effect of large-scale river regulation works on channel evolution needs to be considered for a higher simulation accuracy.

AB Evaluation of calculation models for the unfrozen water content of freezing soil is very important for numerical simulations. Based on the published 250 laboratory data and around 5 years field observed data, this paper evaluated the five widely used unfrozen water content models, i.e., the Zhang et al. (2017a) model, the Anderson and Tice (1972) model, the Michalowski (1993) model, the Mckenzie et al. (2007) model, and the Kozlowski (2007) model. The results show that the five models can all be used to calculate the unfrozen water content of laboratory soil samples. The Anderson and Tice (1972) model, the Michalowski (1993) model, and the Kozlowski (2007) model are descripted by gravimetric unfrozen water content. However, it is difficult to directly measure the gravimetric unfrozen water content during the freezing process. The Mckenzie et al. (2007) model and the Zhang et al. (2017a) model are descripted by volumetric unfrozen water content which can be directly measured during the freezing process. Besides, the parameters of the Zhang et al. (2017a) model are relatively simple, although the model slightly overestimates the volumetric unfrozen water content for some laboratory soils. Therefore, the Zhang et al. (2017a) model is more convenient for numerical simulations. Furthermore, all the models have great potential to calculate unfrozen water content of freezing soils in field observations. This paper would provide significant reference for the selection of unfrozen water content models in the description of hydro-thermo coupling process in cold regions.
