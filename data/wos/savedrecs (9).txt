AB The coastal zone is not only a terrestrial-marine buffer system but also the main site of the organic matter decomposition process, which complicates the identification of the sources of bioactive elements (C, N and S) and the factors that control C-N-S cycling. Here, a multi-isotope approach is developed to distinguish C, N and S sources and the associated geochemical processes in a coastal aquifer system of the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China. The PRD is characterized as a typical multilayer groundwater system with a reducing environment in the confined aquifers and an oxidizing environment in the unconfined aquifer. For the groundwater samples from the unconfined aquifer, the delta N-15 values showed that the ammonium and nitrate originated from manure and sewage, the delta C-13-DIC indicated that dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) was mainly derived from soil CO2 and weathering of carbonate rocks, and the delta S-34 and delta O-18 signals of sulfate suggested that SO42- originated from the dissolution of continental evaporate. The oxidizing environment and the positive relationship between delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- suggested that nitrification and de nitrification were the key factors influencing the transformation of nitrogen in the unconfined aquifer. No obvious correlation between C, N and S content and isotopic composition suggested C-N-S was loosely coupled in this aquifer.
   For the groundwater samples in the confined aquifers, the delta D-H2O and delta O-18-H2O signals suggested that partially confined groundwater samples were affected by seawater intrusion. In the non-seawater intrusion region (NSI zone), the C, N and S content combined with C, N and S isotopic composition indicated that ammonium was derived from the mineralization of organic matter, sulfate mainly originated from rock weathering, and DIC mainly originated from carbonate mineral dissolution and the CO2 produced by organic matter mineralization. Extremely high CH4 concentrations suggested the existence of methanogenesis, while the molar ratio of CH4/(CH4 + (1 + alpha) x CO2) indicated that both acetate fermentation and CO2 reduction were ubiquitous. CO2 reduction had a stronger isotopic fractionation effect on the delta C-13-DIC values, thus, the relatively high delta C-13-DIC values were observed. The electron acceptor was the key factor for organic matter mineralization, and CO2 acted as the main electron acceptor in the NSI Zone. Accordingly, acetate fermentation and CO2 reduction became the key factors driving ammonium release in the NSI zone. In the seawater intrusion region (SI zone), ammonium was derived from the mineralization of organic matter, sulfate was derived from the mixing of fresh water and seawater, and DIC was derived from carbonate mineral dissolution, seawater and the CO2 produced by organic matter mineralization. The delta S-34-SO42- showed a positive correlation with delta O-18-SO42- and a negative correlation with SO42-, suggesting the existence of bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR). High CH4 concentrations also suggested the existence of methanogenesis. The CH4/(CH4 + (1 + alpha) x CO2) ratios indicated that CO2 reduction existed in more than half of the confined groundwater samples in the SI zone. C-N-S was highly coupled in this region because both BSR and methanogenesis can increase the DIC content, while BSR enriches lighter carbon isotopes and methanogenesis enriches heavier carbon isotopes; thus, a wide range of delta C-13-DIC values was found in SI zone. Sulfate or both sulfate and CO2 were the electron acceptors. Accordingly, acetate fermentation, sulfur reduction and CO2 reduction worked together to promote ammonium release for the groundwater samples in the SI Zone. However, the exhaustion of sulfate will make CO2 reduction the key factor for organic matter mineralization in the future.

AB The intensification of the hydrologic cycle due to climate change is likely to influence the extreme precipitation characteristics (i.e., intensity, duration and frequency). These precipitation characteristics are integrated to construct Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves that are widely used to design civil infrastructure systems. These IDF curves are typically derived based on the stationary assumption, however, the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events likely to become nonstationary as a consequence of climate change. During the past decades, unusual extreme precipitation events with more than thousand-year return periods were recorded in the United States. This study investigates the nonstationary nature of the most recent extreme precipitation events occurred over different durations (1-, 3- and 5-days) by incorporating time-varying covariates, such as time, maximum temperature, mean temperature, and the El Nino Southern Oscillation cycle (ENSO). The nonstationary frequency analysis for these extreme events was conducted using nonstationary Generalized Extreme Value distribution by incorporating the time-varying covariates. It was observed that most of the temporal evolution of extreme precipitation events follow the nonstationary pattern, which may be due to the increase in the magnitude of recent extreme precipitation events, especially during hurricane events. Different combination of covariates can potentially influence the nonstationary frequency analysis, and the type of covariate may differ when the accumulated period of extreme precipitation event increased. Based on the Nonstationary Extreme Value Analysis, the return periods associated with extreme precipitation events significantly reduced compared to the stationary approach.

AB Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) is a singular parameter in earth system science. K-s not only governs the rate of flow of water under a hydraulic gradient as specified by the Darcy equation for saturated conditions, but also acts as a scaling factor in many unsaturated flow and transport applications that involve pore-size distribution models. Without knowledge of saturated hydraulic conductivity, it would be difficult to accurately describe the transport of water and dissolved or suspended constituents in soils and sediments, or calculate groundwater transport and recharge, and quantify the exchange between soils and the atmosphere. While the determination of K-s is not especially difficult, it is expensive and (in many cases) infeasible to carry out field or lab experiments for large-scale applications. Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) are a class of largely data-driven empirical models that aim to estimate K-s (and often other hydraulic quantities such as water retention characteristics) from easily available data. In this review, we first briefly discuss the history of the development of the concept of saturated hydraulic conductivity and its relation to the Kozeny-Carman (KC) equation. The KC equation serves as a central point in this review because it determines which soil variables affect saturated flow at the pore-scale, a domain which now can also be visited by computational fluid dynamics models. The KC equation also provides us with a structure in which we can classify the large number of PTFs that have been developed for estimating K-s. Datasets and statistical techniques available for PTF development are discussed, and we also describe common metrics used to assess the accuracy and reliability of PTF estimates. The mutual agreement of two main classes (i.e., an effective porosity KC-based and soil texture-based) of PTFs is analyzed using a number of global maps of predicted K-s. Finally, we discuss challenges and perspectives that might lead to PTFs with improved estimates of K-s. In particular, we suggest establishing and utilizing large and completely independent databases to assess the accuracy and reliability of PTFs for global use, while also drawing in information from pedological and remote sensing sources.

TI Exploring a copula-based alternative to additive error models-for

   FRAMEWORK
AB Inaccurate description of uncertainty in the error models can cause biases in parameter estimation. When the parameters of the deterministic model and the error model are inferred jointly from the observations, the posterior converges to regions that reflect the processes in both high and low flows. If the nature of errors in low and high flows is different to the extent that the same error description cannot be used for both, biases in inference are introduced. In such cases, the parameter posterior will adjust to the region of the hydrograph with longer proportionate presence in the calibration time series. In this paper we demonstrate that the autoregressive order 1 (AR1) description of errors can lead to sub-optimally performing predictive models if the calibration period has substantial sections of inadequately modelled flows. Inference is performed within the Bayesian framework. We show this for a synthetic example as well as a case study. We also see that the predictive uncertainty bands that we get using the AR1 description can be overconfident and also admit negative values. To mitigate this, we analyze an alternative to additive error models. We use a distribution with a non-negative support, gamma in this study, reflecting the uncertainty in the system response at every time step. The gamma distribution is conditioned on the deterministic model output, which determines its mode and standard deviation. We capture autocorrelation in time using copulas. Given that copulas can capture dependence between different marginals, we use different specifications of the marginal distribution for high and low flows. The results show that 1) biases in parameter estimation can be reduced if a representative error description is attained using the flexibility of a copula-based likelihood. 2) The non-negative support allows to make more realistic uncertainty intervals for low flows. 3) However, the autocorrelation parameter in copulas severely interacts with the model and heteroscedasticity parameters. 4) While the formulation, in principle, should be of added value for parameter inference, in case of less informative priors, the flexibility of this description can produce non-robust inference.

AB Forests are important components of the terrestrial ecosystem that play major roles in carbon cycling and associated environmental changes, but more knowledge of the processes involved is required. Therefore, carbon wet deposition and rainfall-runoff processes were examined, as well as carbon fluxes and sources in water in the Xiangxi River watershed, a typical subtropical forested watershed in China. Wet deposition of carbon amounted to 1.31 x 10(4) kg km(-2) between June 2015 and May 2016 (inclusive). The concentration of measured forms of carbon in rainwater of single rainfall event peaked in summer, when the concentration of dissolved total carbon (DTC) was 16.5 mg L-1. In 2016, rainfall-runoff amounted to 7440 kg km(-2), accounting for about 57% of the carbon wet deposition in the watershed. The forest ecosystem in the watershed was found to be a carbon sink every month of the year, with net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) in 2016 of -5.11 x 10(5) kg C km(-2), and monthly NEE was lowest in July (- 8.93 x 10(4) kg C km(-2)). The C-13/C-12 ratio in dissolved inorganic carbon in the river water, relative to Pee Dee Belemnite (delta C-13(DIC)), was higher in the dry season (range, -12.00 to -9.70 parts per thousand; mean, -11.0 parts per thousand) than in the rainy season (range, -14.00 to -12.20 parts per thousand; mean, -12.90 parts per thousand), and higher in downstream reaches (mean values in winter and spring: -10.45 and -12.35 parts per thousand, respectively) than in upstream and middle reaches (-10.63 and -13.30 parts per thousand, -11.63 and -12.87 parts per thousand). In addition, atmospheric precipitation made the highest contributions to the C concentration in the river water in spring and winter (48.6 and 43.2%, respectively).

AB As the only unnatural phenomenon among the four drought types, socioeconomic drought exerts direct negative impacts on socioeconomic system. Socioeconomic drought is closely related to regional sustainable development, which however is received the least attention. Therefore, this study aims to construct a practical framework to fully assess socioeconomic drought dynamic risk. Based on an improved Multivariate Standardized Reliability and Resilience Index (IMSRRI) and copulas function, the joint return periods of different grades drought were calculated to assess the drought risk from a macro perspective, while three drought risk indicators (resilience, vulnerability, and exposure) were adopted for drought risk assessment from a micro perspective. In addition, a 30-year sliding window was applied on the IMSRRI series to explore the dynamic drought risk in a changing environment. Furthermore, the linkages between drought risk indicators and teleconnection factors (Arctic Oscillation (AO), El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)) were explored. The upper Yellow River Basin (UYRB) was selected as a case study, and the study period is from 1959 to 2010. Results indicate that: (1) the 'boolean AND' joint return periods of the moderate, severe and extreme drought in the UYRB were 5.03, 11.7, and 40.78 years, respectively, and the resilience, vulnerability and exposure values of socioeconomic drought were 0.11, 14.38, and 0.37, respectively; (2) the year of 1995 was the turning point of socioeconomic drought risk (before 1995, socio-economic drought risk was decreasing, after 1995, socioeconomic drought risk was increasing), which corresponds well to that of the IMSRRI series; and (3) socioeconomic drought risk is significantly associated with teleconnection factors, with the descending correlation order of PDO > ENSO > AO. This study sheds new insights into socioeconomic drought dynamic risk assessment in a changing environment.

AB As one of the most important agricultural bases in China, the North China Plain (NCP) has experienced serious groundwater depletion. However, estimates of groundwater depletion rates in NCP differ considerably from one another due to different datasets and methods used in the estimation. To get a better estimate of the groundwater depletion and to reveal the recent groundwater changes in NCP, we first merge Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mass concentration (mascon) solutions from different organizations and soil moisture from different land surface models to yield unified mascon solutions and soil moisture estimates. We then estimate the groundwater changes by subtracting the unified soil moisture and surface water storages in the major reservoirs in NCP from the unified mascon solutions. Results show that the groundwater storage in NCP depleted at a rate of 1.7 +/- 0.1 cm/yr from 2004 to mid-2016 but this depletion accelerated to 3.8 +/- 0.1 cm/yr from mid-2013 to mid-2016. Ground-based water table data show a consistent groundwater depletion rate (-3.9 +/- 0.3 cm/yr from mid-2013 to mid-2016) with the GRACE results. We also analyze the land subsidence in NCP by using 116 Global Positioning System (GPS) sites and depict the accelerated land subsidence and expanded subsidence funnels since 2013, which is consistent with the groundwater depletion. All these point to a strong acceleration in groundwater depletion in NCP since mid-2013. Land surface model outputs suggest a precipitation decline from 2013 to 2016, which caused a decline in soil moisture content and surface water storage. This drought forced people to exploit more groundwater to compensate the surface water shortage and thereby led to the accelerated groundwater depletion.

AB The use of hydrologic models to assess long-term watershed condition through repeated simulations of runoff and erosion is one common approach for rangeland health evaluation. However, obtaining vegetative data of appropriate spatiotemporal resolution for model parameterization can be difficult. The goal of this research was to assess the utility of using time-varying, Landsat-derived vegetative values to parameterize an event-based, watershed-scale hydrologic model. This study was conducted on a small, instrumented grassland watershed in the USDA Agricultural Research Service operated Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed in southeastern, Arizona. Cloud-free Landsat scenes were acquired over the watershed for the years 1996-2014. The Soil Adjusted Total Vegetation Index (SATVI) was calculated for each image and calibrated using ground measured data to produce a time series of satellite-based foliar cover rasters. These values were used to parameterize the Rangeland Hydrology and Erosion Model (RHEM) for 26 rainfall-runoff events with corresponding observed data. Three parameterization scenarios using these data aggregated to different temporal resolutions (static, long-term mean, annual mean, and intra-annual values) were compared to a static literature-based scenario for evaluation. The linear relationship between field-measured foliar cover and SATVI showed statistically significant agreement with R-2 = 0.85 and p < 0.05. Simulated runoff volume and peak flow rate using the three remotely sensed parameterization scenarios improved upon that of the literature-based scenario, with the annual mean scenario performing the best of the three temporal aggregations. The methodological framework outlined here provides a means for improved parameterization for watershed-scale modelling where vegetative data may be scarce or unobtainable for long-term analysis.

AB Spatial planning in areas where underground mineral resources occur requires specific and sound environmental policies. Spatial policy should be based on proper identification and planning of sustainable development policies in a manner compatible with legally defined mining transformations. Depending on the initial morphology of the mine subsidence area, mining can lead to the transformation of the aquatic environment, including the occurrence of floods (inundated lands), water-logging, surface drying and/or the threat of flooding. This concerns artificially drained mining and post-mining areas and may result from the restoration of free water flows (turning off pumping stations). This article refers specifically to the permanent flooding and/or threat of flooding of parts of mine subsidence areas. In active mine subsidence areas of hard coal mines the surface relief is permanently subsided. For this reason, the identified flood hazards only have short-term relevance. Special hydromorphological elements of the environment of artificially drained mine subsidence areas, first formulated by the author, can set new standards of quality in environmental policies. The paper contains a description of the most important of these: the base of natural outflow of water, the normal hydrometric reference point the relative elevations of the surface of the mine subsidence areas and the boundary of potential backwater. The introduction of relative elevations of the surface above the hydrometric reference point makes possible purpose -prepared spatial mapping of the mine subsidence area's relief used to assess the threat of flooding. The novel elements have a range of applications, including flood insurance, flood risk management, water management, remediation of mining damage, and sustainable spatial planning. Additionally, the method allows the qualification of existing and recoverable mineral resources for economic usability taking into account the needs of sustainable planning as well as responsible mining techniques.

AB The identification of factors affecting the first flush phenomenon is important for the control of urban nonpoint source pollution. This study developed machine learning algorithms, the regression tree (RT) and random forest (RF) algorithms, to predict the mass first flush ratio (MFFn) from seven rainfall-related variables. We also evaluated the prediction performance of the two algorithms and the relative importance of the seven variables in model prediction. The RF algorithm outperformed the RT algorithm in terms of Akaike information criterion (AIC) values. In general, the target variables simulated using the RF algorithm had lower AIC values than did those of the RT algorithm, except for T-N and T-P. The RF algorithm also provided acceptable performance statistics for the MFF10 to MFF20 of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) (R-2 = 0.71 and 0.67; Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) = 0.67 and 0.52), chemical oxygen demand (COD) (R-2 = 0.70 and 0.71; NSE = 0.66 and 0.62), total organic carbon (TOC) (R-2 = 0.70 and 0.63; NSE = 0.56 and 0.57), and total phosphorus (T-P) (R-2 = 0.72 and 0.71; NSE = 0.68 and 0.58). Suspended solids (SS) predicted by the RF algorithm showed an acceptable value for R-2 (0.68 and 0.64) but a low NSE for the MFF20 (NSE = 0.48). However, the prediction of MFF30 was unacceptable for all target variables. The rainfall-related variables showed different relative importance estimates among the water quality parameters in the MFFn prediction. Results also showed that SOD and COD were closely associated with rainfall intensity (RI). TOC and T-P showed strong relationships with RI and antecedent rainfall (AR). SS was closely related to RI and rainfall duration (R-dur). T-N showed strong relationships with R-dur, respectively. This study demonstrated that the RF algorithm could be a useful tool to predict the MFF10 and MFF20 of BOD, COD, TOC, and T-P on the basis of rainfall characteristics in urban catchments.

AB Rapid urbanization in metropolitan areas easily triggers flashy floods. Urban drainage systems conveying stormwater out of cities are key infrastructure elements for flood mitigation. This study develops an intelligent urban flood drainage system accounting for carryover storage through optimizing the multi-objective operation rules of pumping stations for effectual flood management in Taipei City. The Yu-Cheng pumping station constitutes the study case, and a large number of datasets collected from 17 typhoon/storm events are adopted for model construction and validation. Three objective functions are designed to minimize: (1) the sum of water level fluctuations in the flood storage pond (FSP); (2) the sum of peak FSP water levels; and (3) the mean absolute difference of pump switches between two consecutive times along operation sequence. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm H (NSGA-II) is applied to searching the Pareto-optimal solutions that optimize the trade-off between the objectives. We next formulate the optimal operation rules through a two-tier sorting process based on a compromised Pareto-optimal solution. The comparison of the simulated results obtained from both the optimal operation rules and current operation rules indicate that the optimal operation rules outperform current operation rules for all three objectives, with improvement rates reaching 43% (OBJ1), 3% (OBJ2) and 71% (OBJ3), respectively. We demonstrate that the derived intelligent urban flood drainage system can serve as reliable and efficient operational strategies for urban flood management and flood risk mitigation.

AB The Green-Ampt (GA) model, which assumes a rectangular saturated piston flow and homogeneous isotropic soil with uniform initial water content, is one of the most widely used models for describing infiltration processes. However, these assumptions severely limit the applications of the model. Thus, a modified GA model has long been a topic of interest. This study mainly investigates the effects of the broken-line wetting profile and dynamic capillary pressure on the GA model of a horizontal soil column. The aim is to provide a reasonable correction term for the hydraulic conductivity and suction head. The correction term is considered to be 0.4 when the dynamic capillary pressure (CGA model) is neglected. When the dynamic capillary pressure is taken into account, the correction term is a special function (FGA model). Moreover, the results of the CGA model, FGA model, Richards equation, and Mao model are compared with respect to the measured data for sandy loam, silt loam, and silty clay loam. Richards equation cannot accurately describe the infiltration of water into silt loam, and part of the reason is the high infiltration velocity. Although the Mao model can perfectly simulate the infiltration process in a short time (approximately 50 min in this study), its results gradually deviate from the actual situation after 50 min. The CGA model can predict the entire infiltration processes relatively accurately except in the dry sand with zero water content. However, as in the traditional GA model, small errors can still occur during the early infiltration stage. The FGA model is considered to be the most suitable approach for describing infiltration processes. In this paper, the characteristics of these models are explained, and the parameters of the FGA model are discussed in detail.

AB Freshwater lenses present valuable water resources on barrier islands. Yet, the biogeochemical processes that control the groundwater quality of these freshwater lenses and how they are affected by the prevailing groundwater dynamics is largely unexplored. In this study we investigated the biogeochemistry of a barrier island freshwater lens with a focus on understanding and quantifying organic matter mineralization, sulfur cycling, and chemical fluxes to the land-ocean interface. We analyzed a comprehensive set of hydrogeochemical field data from Spiekeroog Island (Germany), including stable sulfur isotope signatures of dissolved sulfur species, with a reactive transport modeling approach. Tritium-Helium groundwater ages were used to constrain the hydrogeochemistry as a function of residence time. Our results revealed that freshwater lenses can act as archives for anthropogenic pollution, conserving the high sulfur loads associated with historic atmospheric deposition. We observed two distinct (hydro)biogeochemical patterns, which we attribute to a heterogeneous distribution of reactive organic matter. Those patterns were well replicated by two separate reactive transport models that considered the variations in organic matter reactivity. Simulation and field results demonstrated that net sulfur cycling is dominated by microbial sulfate reduction and subsequent iron sulfide precipitation. In the absence of dissolved oxidants, we attribute the observed high stable sulfur isotope fractionation between dissolved sulfate and sulfide of up to 67 parts per thousand to low (< 20 pmol mL(-1) d(-1)) microbial sulfate reduction rates. We show that older groundwater becomes progressively enriched in ammonium and phosphate due to the mineralization of organic matter, and we speculate that lens-derived nutrient fluxes may be important for the benthic zone at local groundwater discharge sites, at least seasonally in spring and summer.

AB The transient storage model (TSM) is a popular solute transport model among hydrologists and ecologists for characterizing solute retention potential of small headwater streams. TSM parameters are most commonly estimated in an inverse modeling framework using tracer breakthrough data. A key challenge in interpreting TSM parameters is the inherent difficulty in the estimation process and relating these parameters with the physical characteristics of streams. While often recognized that multiple sources of uncertainty impact transient storage modeling, rigorous evaluation of TSM parameter uncertainty is rare. Stream flow magnitude has been identified as a key variable in characterizing stream solute transport dynamics, yet no study has shown the impact of flow magnitude on TSM parameter uncertainty. In this paper we study the impact of flow magnitude on TSM parameter uncertainty by using tracer data from repeated tracer studies with changing stream flow magnitudes, and introduce a software tool to perform Markov chain Monte Carlo based parameter estimation and uncertainty evaluation. The software tool developed is capable of performing thousands of model runs within a few hours, which is necessary for Monte Carlo based parameter estimation, and provides a potentially attractive framework for model testing and improvement. TSM parameters were found to be relatively less important during higher flows with large uncertainty bounds and clear evidence of parameter correlations. The importance of TSM parameters on solute transport seemed to increase as flow decreased with seasonal baseflow recession. Our findings highlight the need for improved field methodologies to reduce parameter uncertainty and the need for further improvement in the model structure for successful stream characterization.

AB Modeling and mapping of floods using one (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) models has resulted in significant progress in our understanding of river hydraulics and hydrology. The existing modeling approach can be improved further through a better understanding of the interactions between river hydrodynamics and subsurface processes. Saturated conditions in subsurface and floodplains can lead to longer and deeper inundation from low intensity but continuous flood events. To understand the combined effect of surface-subsurface hydrology and hydrodynamics on streamflow generation and subsequent inundation during floods, this study uses an integrated surface water-groundwater (SW-GW) modeling approach for simulating flood conditions. Simulation of a high flooding event for the Upper Wabash River basin in Indiana, USA, shows that the river-floodplain hydrodynamics is simulated more accurately without the need for extensive calibration by using a two-dimensional integrated SW-GW model. Additionally, an integrated model provides a more realistic simulation of flood hydrodynamics for different antecedent soil conditions. Specifically, results show that the streamflow, flood stages and inundation area obtained for the dry scenario are significantly lower when compared to the saturated scenario. These findings are further validated by applying the integrated modeling approach for an entirely different watershed (Croton River) in the state of New York. Overall, the findings from this study suggest that the current practice of simulating floods which assumes an impervious surface may not be providing realistic estimates of flood inundation, and that an integrated approach incorporating all the hydrologic and hydraulic processes in the river system must be adopted.

AB Coastal wetlands are among the most productive and fluctuating ecosystems of the world. These ecosystems, however, are affected by human activities that may change their nutrient dynamics and water regime, causing the degradation of water quality, the disappearance of lagoons and wetlands, or the establishment of invasive species. In this context, the La Pletera salt marsh is composed of several coastal lagoons and wetlands that were affected by the incomplete construction of an urban development in 1987. This area has been the focus of two LIFE restoration projects aimed at recovering its ecological functionality, and protecting a threatened endemic fish species (Aphanius iberus). Thanks to these projects, a new lagoon was created in 2002 simply by excavating below sea level, which ensured water permanency all year round. Between 2014 and 2017, samples were regularly taken to measure temperature, salinity and water levels in the lagoons of the La Pletera salt marsh. In this study we focus on two natural lagoons (Life A and Life B), and the one created in 2002 (Life C). Using the one-dimensional General Lake Model (GLM), we evaluated water inflows and outflows and evaporation fluxes, since water circulation determines the resultant salinity in these lagoons. This model is an open source model that, to our knowledge, is being used for the first time in such small lagoons. The study focuses mainly on dry periods, when the lagoon inflow is low and evaporation is high. Results show that Life A and Life B are more affected by evaporation and that lagoon water circulation was higher in Life-C. From a management point of view, the maintenance of salinity conditions is fundamental for the protection of Aphanius iberus, a species adapted to high salinity fluctuations but strongly affected by competition from the invasive Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) when water salinity is not high enough or variable. Between 2014 and 2018, additional lagoons were created in the La Pletera salt marsh as part of a new LIFE project. Knowledge of the hydrology and the resultant water salinity in the new lagoons are essential to ensure the continued survival of Aphanius iberus in the area.

AB In order to examine temporal patterns and the hydrological cycle of shallow soda pans, six pans in Hungarian Great Plain were sampled at monthly intervals over a period of 2.5 years. Water chemistry and physical parameters (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, light, water color - Pt color -, turbidity, phosphorous and nitrogen forms, silica, alkalinity, chloride, sulfate content, chemical oxygen demand) were measured both in the field and laboratory and analyzed using multivariate statistical methods. It was possible to distinguish the pans on the basis of water color, separating them into two groups: G1, consisting of colored pans characterized by low turbidity and high Pt color, and G2, consisting of turbid pans characterized by high turbidity and low Pt color. Both groups displayed temporal (seasonal, as well as annual) trends, and their hydrological cycles followed regular cyclical patterns. Three hydrological phases (filling, drying, and desiccated) were described in the case of the colored pans, and five for the turbid (filling, diluted, drying, concentrated, desiccated). Regarding the recommendation that there be a reduced time interval in the sampling to determine the typical chemical characterization of the pans.

AB Prediction of river flow as a fundamental source of hydrological information plays a crucial role in various fields of water projects. In this study, at first, the capabilities of two time series analysis approaches, namely self exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models, then three artificial intelligence approaches including artificial neural networks (ANN), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and random forests (RF) models were investigated to predict monthly river flow. For this purpose, monthly river flow data of Brantford and Galt stations on Grand River, Canada, for the period from October 1948 to September 2017 were used and their performances were evaluated based on various evaluation criteria. The SETAR model showed better performance than the GARCH one in prediction of river flows at the stations of study. Additionally, the stand-alone MARS and RF models performed slightly better than the ANN. Next, hybrid models were developed by coupling the used ANN, MARS, and RF models with SETAR and GARCH models as the non-linear time series models. The performance of various models presented in this study indicated that the new hybrid models demonstrated a much better performance compared with the stand-alone ones at both stations. Among the developed hybrid models, the RF-SETAR models generally had the best accuracy to improve the river flows modeling. As a result, it can be concluded that the presented methodology can be used to predict hydrological time series such as river flow with a high level of accuracy.

AB The Alpine region is a particularly sensitive environment rich in water resources nurturing delicate freshwater ecosystems, which are however threatened by intensive exploitation for hydropower production and irrigated agriculture. The impact of water uses on the hydrological cycle is intimately intertwined with changes of the climatic forcing, which operate over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. In the present study historical time series of streamflow, precipitation and temperature, recorded in the Adige River Basin, a large Alpine watershed in northeastern Italy, are analyzed in order to quantify alterations of the main hydrological fluxes due to changes in climate and water uses. Spatial and temporal patterns of change are detected by comparing annual and seasonal components of the water budget performed in four representative sub-catchments (with size ranging from 207 to 9,852 km(2)) characterized by different climatic and water use conditions. Afterwards, a multi-method approach is applied for attributing the observed changes to their main drivers. Summer stream flow depletion affects the Adige lowlands since the 70s, which is attributed to both the reduction of winter precipitation and the development of irrigated agriculture. Conversely, winter streamflow increased in head-water catchments due to the increase of aquifers recharge in autumn, which is consistent with the increase of precipitation in the same period. These results reveal that the impact of climate change on the Adige Basin is multifaceted, scale-dependent and intertwined with the effects of changes in water resources exploitation.

AB Estimation of groundwater recharge is more essential for managing aquifers, particularly in arid regions with limited access to water resources. Low potentiality of aquifer recharge, deep groundwater levels and impacts from other important sources like irrigation return flow add more complexities to estimating recharge in these areas. In this research, physical and chemical (tracer) techniques including water-table fluctuation (WTF), chloride mass balance (CMB), stable isotopes (H-2 and O-18) and water-budget equation (WBE) were applied to estimate recharge into the Birjand alluvial aquifer in arid areas of SE Iran with a mean annual precipitation of about 147 mm. Recharge rates, in ascending order, were calculated about 5.0, 9.2, 33.2 and 41.7 mm year(-1) using isotopes, CMB, WTF and WBE methods, respectively. Isotopes and chloride tracers assessed the rainfall related aquifer recharge, while the other methods represented total recharge including rainfall infiltration plus deep percolation of irrigation water (irrigation return flow). Total recharge rate of the Birjand aquifer was estimated in average at 37.5 mm year(-1), partitioned between the rainfall recharge (7.0 mm year(-1)) and irrigation return flow (30.5 mm year(-1)). The values represent an average rainfall recharge coefficient of about 4.8% of the annual precipitation and return flow coefficient of 15% of the total annual applied water for irrigation. Recharge estimates are recommended as initial guesses for calculating water-balance in order to manage valuable groundwater resources in other arid-land aquifers. The study highlighted priorities of the stable isotope and WTF methods in estimating rainfall and total (rainfall + return flows) recharge of the groundwater in arid regions, respectively.

AB Point-scale gauge observations have inherent limitations, making it difficult to study the spatial and temporal distributions of precipitation in alpine regions due to gauge undercatch and complex terrains. The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission provides new-generation satellite precipitation products that are promising alternative data sources in mountainous areas. However, quality evaluations and bias corrections should be conducted prior to the application of satellite data. In this study, an unprecedentedly dense ground station network composed of more than 1000 automatic weather stations (AWSs) over the Tianshan Mountains in China are used for bias correction of the Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) product. First, universal kriging interpolation is used to downscale IMERG from 0.1 degrees to 500 m to ensure a fair comparison with the gauge observations. Then, the downscaled IMERG precipitation data over this region are corrected by two methods, i.e., stepwise regression (STEP) and geographically weighted regression (GWR). Both methods are established on various terrain factors and vegetation indexes that have strong relations with precipitation. The results show that (1) GWR outperform the conventional STEP method as well as the original IMERG; (2) the original IMERG performs best over the plain region (less than 1000 m), while the best correction effect was found in middle and low-elevation region (1000-1500 m); and (3) the performance of the GWR model is largely dependent on the number of available training stations in mountainous areas. Overall, the methods and results presented in this study provide insight into the correction of satellite precipitation data in mountainous areas with scarce ground observations.

AB Hydrologic control structures are designed to connect or disconnect water movement in natural surface water-groundwater systems, and it is important to represent these features effectively within a finite difference/element model without over-discretization. This study presents efficient numerical schemes for operating water allocation and water rights systems in integrated hydrosystem models. We developed a numerical scheme for representing these structures directly within integrated surface/subsurface hydrologic models by creating boundary condition links to route water through control structures or by breaking nodal connections to prevent water flow. The boundary condition linking and mesh cutoff schemes minimize the need for mesh regeneration and modification. Through illustrative examples involving agricultural tile drainage and dam-reservoir operation systems, the numerical connection (boundary condition linking) and disconnection (mesh cutoff) techniques are demonstrated to be effective and efficient at simulating the hydrological processes affected by anthropogenic water resources controls. A proof-of-concept demonstration consisting of complex water supply (dam and groundwater pumping wells) and demand (farms, municipality, and stream) highlights how the numerical schemes for water management operations can be used to optimize surface water and groundwater extraction and distribution using a fully-integrated model.

AB Intensity Duration Frequency (IDF) curves are important tools for hydraulic and hydrologic design. Considering that there are different approaches to obtain the rainfall quantiles on which the IDF curves are based, the availability of a method to evaluate their reliability is of great importance. With this aim, in this work the multifractal properties of hourly rainfall data recorded at 23 rain gauges in the Umbria Region (Italy) have been used to select the most appropriate frequency analysis method of extreme annual rainfall at each location. Three methods have been tested: Local Frequency Analysis (by fitting at each station extreme annual rainfall data of different durations by a probability distribution function), Regional Frequency Analysis approach based on L-Moments and flood index method (considering the extreme annual rainfall data from all the stations), and a variant of the latter method known as In-site Regional Frequency Analysis (based on the consideration of the station as a region). Therefore, quantiles of rainfall for different durations and return periods have been obtained. These quantiles have been fitted to the Montana Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curve. The scaling properties of rainfall have been obtained through out the empirical moments scaling function K(q). Their comparison with some scaling behavior properties of the IDF curves has let the selection of the most adequate quantile estimation method at each site, being the Regional Frequency Analysis the most appropriate one for 14 out of the 23 sites included in the study.

AB Better understanding of raindrop detachment, interrill wash and erosion-limiting degree in interrill processes is critical for accurately modelling interrill erosion and implementing proper anti-erosion strategies. Simulated rainfall experiments were conducted on a clayey loessal soil at three rainfall intensities (42, 60 and 90 mm h(-1)), five slope gradients (7 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees and 25 degrees) and rainfall duration of 40 min. Results showed that raindrop detachment rate initially decreased rapidly within a few minutes and then reached a relative steady state during rainfall. The initial and steady raindrop detachment rate increased with increased rainfall intensity. Interrill wash rate peaked early and then decreased to a relative constant rate during the rainfall. The initial, maximum and steady interrill wash rate increased with increased rainfall intensity and slope gradient. Erosion-limiting degree (ELD), defined as the ratio of interrill wash rate to raindrop detachment rate, ranged from 10.99% to 35.70% under experimental conditions, indicating that interrill erosion system was transport-limited. The ELD decreased with rainfall intensity and increased linearly (R-2 = 0.90) with slope gradient. The higher the rainfall intensity, the stronger the transport-limiting in interrill erosion processes; the steeper the slope gradient, the weaker the transport-limiting in interrill erosion processes. Raindrop detachment is the dominant process in detaching soil particles, whereas interrill flow contributes to washing out detached sediments. The findings of this study, especially ELD, largely improved the understanding of interrill erosion processes.

AB This study examines the question of how much information one can extract from a tracer-based hydrograph separation in a remote and minimally gaged alpine catchment in Chile. We combine PCA-based endmember mixing analysis to identify the sources of flow contribution to the Diguillin River with a hierarchical Bayesian mixing model to integrate spatial and temporal variability in endmember concentration and quantify the source contributions to streamflow over time. The PCA-analysis shows that precipitation isotopes do not vary by elevation (e.g. snow and rainfall had identical signatures) but vary significantly by season, and that a third endmember is necessary to bound streamflow variability at the basin outlet, which was not captured by our field sampling. One of the main advantages of Bayesian methods is the quasi-machine learning capabilities, where we treated the third endmember as a parameter from which the mixing model could both estimate proportional contributions as well as posterior estimates for the tracer concentrations.
   The two tracer, three endmember hydrograph separation revealed groundwater to be the largest and precipitation (rain and snow) to be the smallest contributor, on average, to streamflow with the third unknown endmember contributing around 40% of streamflow during the Winter wet season. We hypothesize that inter flow is occurring as the third endmember in the Alto Diguillin subwatershed, based on inferred tracer values and the presence of alluvium atop impermeable bedrock along certain reaches. More work is necessary to observe and sample these flowpaths, which was not possible during this study. The results of this work have implications for water resource management, since groundwater sustains the majority of streamflow in the Diguillfn, and climate change will impact the timing and quantity of baseflow and interflow. Overall, we demonstrate the utility of combining PCA with Bayesian statistical modeling and inference to extract maximum information from a limited field dataset in a remote alpine catchment. The findings of this work can guide future water management in the Diguillfn, but also provide clear questions for future research.

AB This study deals with the time-dependent nonlinear response of catchments to the variations in rainfall. Both the rainfall and runoff discharge fields are treated to be nonstationary in time. A functional series representation, a generalization of the linear convolution integral, is employed to quantify the nonlinear relation between the input and output. The Fourier-Stieltjes representation approach is used to evaluate the variance of runoff discharge in the spectral frequency domain. The analysis based on the spectral solution for the runoff discharge variance clearly demonstrates that larger values of rainfall characteristic time scale or catchment size parameter lead to larger variability of the runoff discharge, while a larger catchment scale parameter leads to smaller variability of the runoff discharge.

AB Consistent hydrological models for multiple time steps are needed to respond to the operational requirement of using a model for different objectives and with varied data sets. In this paper, we propose a rationale for multi-time step model development based on the temporal consistency of the fluxes modelled. The new methodology is applied for the temporal downscaling of a lumped rainfall-runoff model (GR4J) from daily to sub-hourly time steps, within a coherent modelling framework. The modelling tests are performed at eight time steps from daily to 6-min, for a set of 240 French catchments, for which 2400 flood events were selected. To identify an improved multi-time step model structure, a two-step approach is followed. First, we propose a model diagnosis to evaluate the internal behaviour of the baseline model across time steps, whereby a significant inconsistency was found in the simulated water fluxes, especially interception. Second, we recommend a prognosis to improve the scale invariance of the modelled water balance by matching the model fluxes across time scales. The new model structure retained for sub-daily time steps is derived from the daily baseline model by refining the representation of the interception process, so that the flux-matching condition is satisfied. A complementary modification of the groundwater exchange function is also resumed following a previous study. The structural changes are motivated by the improvement of model flux consistency across time steps, while also improving model performance. This new dual paradigm for model identification, based on both flux coherence and output accuracy, also results in more robust model parameters across time steps.

AB A typical deficiency of ensemble forecasts is the lack of calibration; e.g., ensemble members are under-dispersed and, consequently, probabilities estimated from them cannot be taken at their face values. Self-calibration is one of the unique theoretic properties of the Bayesian forecasting system, BFS. Its ensemble version, EBFS, inherits this property, provided the ensemble size is large enough. That requirement motivated the version with randomization, EBFSR, presented in part I. Its unique advantage is the operational feasibility of generating a hydrologic ensemble forecast of large size, M (having hundreds or even thousands of members), from a meteorologic input ensemble forecast of small size, M-I (having only tens or hundreds of members): M-I < M, with M = M-I/R, where R stands for randomization factor (R > 1 and integer). This R-fold enlargement of the ensemble size is achieved through a Monte Carlo generator (sans extra runs of the hydrologic model) and, therefore, requires little extra effort or computing time. But what are the statistical implications?
   The objective of this part II is to identify experimentally the sampling properties of the EBFSR so that its advantage can be properly harnessed in operational forecasting. The core matter to understand and to quantify is the tradeoff between the computing efficiency and the statistical efficiency of the EBFSR. This is so because the user must specify (i) the largest acceptable sampling error [measured in terms of the average expected maximum absolute difference, (E) over bar (MAD), between the true but unknown predictive distribution function of the forecasted variate and the empirical distribution function estimated from a sample of size m, a fraction of the ensemble size M], and (ii) the tradeoff between M-I and R. Critical to deciding this tradeoff are two relationships: (E) over bar (MAD) = xi(m) and M-E = tau(M-P, R), where M-P is the size of the input sub-ensemble with positive precipitation amounts, and M-E is the effective sample size of the output sub-ensemble of size MPR. In terms of output/input ensemble sizes, the computing efficiency is M/M-I = R > 1, and the statistical efficiency is M-E/MPR < 1 because M-P < M-E < MPR.
   Based on results of large numerical experiments, general parametric forms of xi and tau are identified, and the dependence of the parameter values is established on factors such as the forecast type (probabilistic river stage forecast, probabilistic stage transition forecast, probabilistic flood forecast), the forecast lead time, the magnitude of the precipitation input uncertainty, and the informativeness of the deterministic hydrologic model employed by the EBFSR. Finally, two algorithms are formulated to aid the user in specifying the values of M and R, such that <(E)over bar>(MAD) does not exceed the largest acceptable value and that operational constraints are satisfied (e.g., constraints regarding the input ensemble size M-I or the feasible number of runs of the hydrologic model).

AB Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) is a key property in hydrological and environmental studies. As its measurement is unfortunately cumbersome, pedotransfer functions (PTFs) have been commonly used to estimate it. The literature brings a large number of Ks PTFs, most of which have been developed for temperate regions, small databases and/or limited territorial scales. The presence of soil structural variables in these models, such as those related to the water retention curve, is less common than the use of granulometric fractions and bulk density (BD). One objective of this work was to develop Ks PTFs for a database of tropical (Brazilian) and temperate (European) soils that include soil texture and/or BD, as well as effective porosity (EP) [total porosity minus theta (300-cm suction)], which is a soil structural property. This study evaluated the performances of the proposed PTFs and compared their predictions to those from seven models used in the literature, considering a testing database with characteristics similar to the calibration dataset. Comparison of the performances of the PTFs were made at three levels of representation of the study databases: all soils, temperate and tropical soils, and textural class groups. The results showed that the PIT proposed based only on EP was more accurate and reliable than the PTFs based only on texture and/or BD, also with greater reliability than the other models from the literature, reinforcing the importance of using structural variables in the estimation of Ks. We confirmed that the use of models developed for temperate soils based on texture and/or BD must be avoided in the prediction of Ks of tropical soils and vice versa. This study indicates the need for including new predictors in Ks PTFs, especially those that reflect macropore flows better. In addition, standard and more representative Ks measurement methods, based on an adequate sample size, are also required for achieving more accurate Ks predictions.

ID RIVER-BASIN; CONFLICT-MANAGEMENT; COOPERATION; GOVERNANCE
AB Why water diplomacy? What does diplomacy have to do with water? Is cooperation over transboundary surface and ground waters the exclusive domain of diplomats and foreign policy experts? Or mainly the purview of water professionals negotiating agreements on shared water resources? Why should non-governmental stakeholders be involved in transboundary water dialogues? These questions lie at the heart of debates and dialogues around the theory and practice of water diplomacy.
   The main aim of this Special Issue is to elaborate the intersect of science, policy, and practice and discuss ways knowledge can be distributed more equally and bridged across these spheres. In this editorial article, we summarize key messages on water diplomacy brought forward by authors in this Special Issue. We have identified the trends below as a possible future direction on water diplomacy research as well as issues that need to be addressed in the policy debate. One of the overarching themes is how to ensure that available technical knowledge informs the political tracks of water diplomacy and how to build trust effectively to ensure sustainability of water cooperation processes.

AB In this study, effort is made to estimate weekly rainfall over India at 36 meteorological subdivisions during monsoon 2016 (June to September) by using several precipitation products from different satellites which include Indian National Satellite System (INSAT) INSAT-3D derived Hydro Estimate (HE), INSAT Multi-Spectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA) rainfall products, Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) derived from JPL, NASA, and National Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) Merged Satellite Gauge (NMSG) of IMD. Different satellite estimates, and rain gauge satellite merged products have been compared with gridded rainfall products prepared by India Meteorological Department (IMD). HE at 4 km pixel resolution and IMSRA at 0.10(0) x 0.10(0) resolution are derived rainfall products from Indian satellite INSAT-3D.GPM (IMERG) product is derived at 0.10(0) x 0.10(0) resolution from Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) satellite jointly operated by JAXA (Japan) and NASA (USA). NCMRWF Merged Satellite-Gauge (NMSG) rainfall data has been generated at a 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees grid resolution by IMD & NCMRWF. The data is analyzed preliminarily for the southwest monsoon season of 2016 at weekly temporal resolution. The overall comparison shows that GPM (IMERG) estimates better rainfall over the coastal and plain region, however, HE estimates better rainfall over the hilly region, in general, and for Kerala region, particularly. NMSG product needs improvement over the hilly region and considerable improvement is required in IMSRA product. For all 36 meteorological subdivisions, NMSG product has 0.56 average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies (NSE) for 17 weeks with IMD Gridded rainfall data. However, for satellite-derived rainfall by GPM (IMERG), HE and IMSRA have 0.29, 0.1 and -0.8 average NSE at 17 weeks, respectively. Based on this study, it is concluded that NMSG daily rainfall product is best, however, amongst satellite-derived rainfall, overall GPM gives a better result with a few exceptions and IMSRA need more modifications.

AB The strategy of ion doping in metal oxide is generally used to enhance the photoanode film feature, attain a suitable energy band and enhance carrier mobility. Here, a rare earth element erbium was doped into TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL) by adding erbium trinitrate into the titanium precursor solution. In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to fabricate perovskite sensitized erbium doped TiO2 nanoparticle (Er3+@TNPs) photoanode solar cell with different hole transport materials (HTMs) and graphite coated counter electrode. The perovskite sensitized solar cell (PSSC) built with CH3NH3SnI3 sensitized Er3+@TNPs photoanode and spiro-MeOTAD HTM shows an impressive photovoltaic performance had the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.54% when compared to the undoped TiO2 photoanode PSSC. The results of this investigation indicate that the rare earth ion doping could be a promising method for producing effective ETL and enhanced performance PSSCs.

AB Photoinduced expansion is a special property of chalcogenide glasses, which makes them useful for various applications in photonics. A clear understanding of the kinetics and the topography of photoinduced effects is fundamental to improve potential applications. A detailed study on bulk glass is performed using in situ Atomic Force Microscope measurements. The corresponding expected thermal contribution is obtained by numerical simulation using Finite Elemental Analysis method. The results show a significant difference between the dynamics of metastable/permanent and transitory effects, with the permanent photoexpansion being much larger in magnitude and slower in kinetics than the transient or reversible changes. The former effect is of athermal origin. However, the dynamic response of the latter is similar to that expected from thermoelastic expansion, suggesting a close correlation between the two effects, which remains to be established.

AB Pyroelectric luminescence was observed in noncentrosymmetrical crystal LiGaO2 with the direct band gap around 6 eV. For the first time spectral and kinetic characteristics of pyroelectric luminescence were obtained. The temporal structure of the PEL signal was determined as a sequence of pulses with duration not longer than several nanoseconds. This allowed proposing of the luminescence mechanism: in vacuum conditions in LiGaO2 crystal pyroelectric luminescence occurs inside the sample due to radiative recombination of electrons with the positively charged intrinsic luminescence centres.

AB New strategies for tunable optical activities (OAs) are of fundamental importance in the advancement of science and technology. Here, we report hierarchically chiral mesostructured SnO2 films (CMSFs) deposited on FTO substrates via a symmetry breaking agent-inducing method. Three levels of chiral structures exist in the film, including tertiary plates helically arranged in fan-like form, secondary subplates helically stacked along [001] direction and primary nanosheets twisted along [100] direction. The thickness of plates was significantly increased with decreasing reactants concentration due to slower and preferential growth of plates along [001] direction, The increasing number of nanosheets results in enhancement and red shift of circular dichroism (CD) signals based on electron-transition absorption and reflection-based OA, which is in accordance with the circular Bragg resonance theory. Such novel chiral films with tunable OAs and morphologies may bring new ideas for design and synthesis of chiral inorganic materials with specific chirality and OA in the nanomaterial field.

AB Ultraviolet (UV) light photodetectors fabricated from metal oxide semiconductors or conducting polymers due to their inferior electric performances remain insufficient. To overcome this limitation, a conducting polymer/metal oxide semiconductor heterostructure system is one of the significant approaches which can be used. To verify this assumption, polyaniline network (PANI) and p-type polyaniline/n-type titania nanocomposite (PT) were synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerization and used as self-powered UV photodetector (SUP), in the present work. Herein, the SUP devices based on PT (PTD) and PANI (PD) were capable of generating photo current flow without any need to an external power source. At zero bias, PTD showed superior stable on-off photo-current switching, appropriate responsivity to different UV light power density illumination and appropriate response time, even for months. Our results provide opportunities for developing PTD as a SUP with high-performance and practical use.

AB Absorption and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectra of HoFe3(BO3)(4) and HoAl3(BO3)(4) single crystals were measured as a function of temperature in the range of 90-293 K. Based on integrals of f-f absorption and MCD bands, temperature dependences of the paramagnetic magneto-optical activity (MOA) of f-f transitions were obtained for the first time. It was revealed that MOA of the same f-f transitions in the studied crystals were substantially different and their temperature dependences did not follow the Curie-Weiss law in contrast to the properties of allowed transitions. The observed phenomena were accounted for as a consequence of the nature of f-f transitions allowance. In temperature dependences of the MOA of two transitions the singularities were revealed, which indicated to some local structural distortions in the corresponding excited states.

AB Mn-doped CsPbCl3 (CsPbCl3:Mn) perovskite colloidal quantum dots (QDs) attract a great deal of interests, and have great potentials for various optoelectronics applications due to their outstanding optical and electrical properties. However, practical applications of CsPbCl3:Mn QDs are severely limited by the cumbersome preparation methods and low photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQY). Herein, we propose a single-step ultrasonic synthesis method to successfully synthesize CsPbCl3:Mn QDs with controlled size and morphology by changing the Mn:Pb ratio. Simultaneously, we introduce triethylamine (TETN) to passivate the surface of CsPbCl3:Mn QDs. The phase purity, microstructure, chemical composition and photoluminescence properties of the samples were investigated by means of various analytic techniques. The synthesized QDs exhibit dual emissions of 411 and 601 nm, ascribing to the excitonic emission of QDs and the characteristic Mn2+ emission, respectively. The quantum yield of the CsPbCl3:Mn QDs could therefore be significantly improved from 17.49 to 41.15%. We believe that the facial synthesis method and the surface passivation of TETN can also be applied to other transition metal or lanthanide ions doped lead halide perovskite QDs.

AB TAG transparent ceramics with different Tb4O7 additive contents were successfully fabricated using solid state reaction and vacuum sintering. The samples (T1-T5) added with 0-0.3 wt% Tb4O7 exhibit high transparency in the visible and near infrared regions. It was found that adding 0.1-0.2 wt% Tb4O7 was in favor of eliminating pores and optimizing magneto-optical properties and the ceramic added with 0.1 wt% Tb4O7 (T2) possesses the highest transmittance, which reached 80.32% at 1064 nm. The TAP phase was detected by XRD and appeared in the microstructure of sample T7 with added 0.8 wt% Tb4O7 content, which inhibited grain boundary migration and deteriorated the optical quality of TAG transparent ceramics. The Verdet constant increases slightly with a small increase in the amount of Tb4O7 addition and the value of sample 15 added with 0.3 wt% Tb4O7 is 177.5rad/(T.m), which is 32% higher than that of the commercially TGG crystal.

AB Nanostructured materials employed as passive nonlinear absorptive limiters offer protection to the human eyes and optical sensors from damage by pulsed laser radiation. However, such materials are prone to laser induced damage, which can be avoided or minimized by employing a robust shell layer. Here, we report the optical limiting properties of nine-atom silver quantum clusters grafted in TiO2 nanotube matrix (Ag(9)QCs-TNT). Nonlinear absorption revealed from open-aperture Z-scan measurements on Ag(9)QCs-TNT using both 5 ns (532 nm) and 100 fs (800 nm) laser pulses is larger than those observed from its pristine counterparts (Ag(9)QCs and TNT). The optical limiting threshold value obtained for Ag(9)QCs-TNT under fs excitation is smaller by a factor of five compared to that under ns excitation, indicating its ability to passively limit high intensity laser radiation for potential device applications.

AB Scintillation and luminescence properties of a novel organic crystal scintillator, 1,4-bis(2-methylstyryl) benzene (bis-MSB), were measured and compared with those of the conventional trans-stilbene organic crystal scintillator. Although trans-stilbene has been used for beta or neutron detection, trans-stilbene cannot be applied at high temperature conditions due to a lower melting point (124 degrees C). Liquid scintillators or plastic scintillators also cannot be used at high temperature. Usually, bis-MSB has been used as dopant in liquid scintillators to obtain fast scintillation'decay and high luminescence quantum yield, and its melting point is 181 degrees C higher than that of trans-stilbene. In this paper, we focused on bis-MSB in solid state. The bis-MSB and trans-stilbene crystals were grown by the self-seeding vertical Bridgman method using double quartz ampoules. The bis-MSB crystal had the fast decay time of similar to 4.2 ns and the increased light yield of similar to 12,000 ph/5.5 MeV(alpha), while trans-stilbene had the decay time of similar to 8.5 ns and the light yield of similar to 8500 ph/5.5 MeV(alpha). The photoluminescence quantum yield was almost constant up to 125 degrees C for bis-MSB and only up to 50 degrees C for trans-stilbene. We succeeded in obtaining the novel organic crystal scintillator which can operate even at higher temperature up to 125 degrees C.

AB A series of well-dispersed (Ce1-xTbx)PO4 (x = 0-1) microspheres, with an average diameter of similar to 1.2 mu m, have been originally prepared via two-phase interfacial precipitation and subsequent calcination. Characteristics of the as-synthesized and calcination products were investigated by the combined techniques of XRD, FE-SEM, TEM, FT-IR and TG-DSC. Under 275 nm excitation, tuning the emission color from blue (0.17, 0.02) to green (0.30, 0.56) was realized via varying the Tb3+ content and through Ce3+ -> Tb3+ energy transfer. The optimal content of Tb3+ was found to be similar to 15 at% (x = 0.15), and the energy transfer was determined to occur via electric dipole-dipole interaction. Moreover, both the emissions of Ce3+ and Tb3+ present gradually higher thermal stability with increasing Tb3+ content owing to enhanced energy transfer. The (Ce0.85Tb0.15)PO4 microspheres, which possess the highest absolute quantum efficiency (similar to 60.1%) across the series and excellent thermal stability (activation energy for thermal quenching of luminescence: similar to 0.312 eV), may potentially serve as a single-phase green phosphor for solid-state lighting and field-emission display.

AB High index nanostructures lead to unique light-matter interactions and strong optical resonances for potential light trapping applications and improved optical performances. In this work, Gaussian shaped subwavelength 3D nanostructures are introduced and rapid prototyping of these nanostructures is carried out on silicon (Si) in a single-step using focused ion beam (FIB) milling. The tapered geometry of Gaussian pillar structures provided reflection suppression from the smaller tip in contrast to its extended base, enabling trapping of light, confirmed through light reflection calculations and hot spots observed through absorption density distributions. The nature of accelerated ions in a FIB system is directly used and highly ordered Gaussian pillar like subwavelength nanostructures are fabricated in a single-step on Si. Simulations and experiments demonstrate nanostructure evolution from periodically spaced subwavelength nanoholes to Gaussian pillar structures with tuning of beam processing parameters, providing fabrication flexibility. The proposed light management structures, investigated through Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) calculations, exhibit 10-20% reflection for a broadband visible wavelength range against planar Si and previously reported Si structures (such as nano-cones, nano-wires, nano pyramids etc.). Experimental results support theoretical predictions and provide evidence for antireflection properties from the fabricated nanostructures. Considering the rapid fabrication approach and tunable nature of Gaussian shaped nanostructures, exhibiting unique optical properties; this work provides realization of nanoscale light management 3D structures for localized light trapping and antireflection applications.

AB We synthesized 0, 0.02, 0.2, 1.0, and 10% Ce3+ doped CaF2-ALF(3)-ALPO(4) glasses; and then, we evaluated their photoluminescence (PL), scintillation and thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) properties. Depending on the concentration of Ce3+, PL quantum yield (QY) ranged from 15.8 to 62.8%. When the materials were irradiated by X-rays, scintillation was observed with an emission peak around 330 nm due to 5d -> 4f transitions of Ce3+. The scintillation decay times ranged 14-25 ns. The glasses showed intense TSL, and the glow peak was broad peaking around 100 degrees C. The 0.2% and 1.0% Ce3+ doped samples demonstrated high sensitivity with a good linearity over 5 orders of magnitude (0.1 mGy-10 Gy).

AB Monodisperse Gd4O3F6 spindle-like microcrystals have been successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal process followed by heat treatment by using 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Omim]BF4) as fluorine source and morphology controller. The possible formation mechanism of the spindle-like microcrystals has been proposed based on the time-dependent experiments. The down- and up-conversion (DC and UC) luminescence properties of Gd4O3F6:Ln(3+) (Ln = Eu, Tb, Dy, Ho, Tm, Sm, Yb/Er, Yb/Ho) samples are studied and the energy transfer mechanism between Dy3+-Eu3+, Yb3+-Er3+ and Yb3+-Ho3+ were further discussed. In addition, down- and up-conversion multicolor luminescence of Dy3+-Eu3+ or Yb3+-Er3+ co-doped Gd4O3F6 phosphors have been successful realized by changing the concentrations of Eu3+ and Yb3+ ions, which demonstrate that Gd4O3F6 crystal is a potential luminescent host for phosphors.

AB A series of highly efficient blue emission compounds with D-A-D molecular structures were designed and synthesized, in which oxadiazole group was used as electronic acceptor (A), and carbazole/acridine groups as electronic donor (D). It is found that the compounds containing acridine both had small energy splitting between singlet excited state (S-1) and triplet excited state (T-1) (that is, Delta E-ST) and thus showed distinct thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics. Moreover, they both had high photoluminescent quantum yields (PLQY) even up to 93%. In comparison, the compound only containing carbazole just showed prompt emission but no delayed fluorescence. The blue organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) using the TADF compounds as emitters achieved a high maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQE) up to 22.3% with Commission Internationale de L'e'clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.16, 0.24). Triplet excitons were efficiently utilized in the device. The further optimized OLEDs achieved more outstanding comprehensive performance.

AB New type of optical material, BaF2:ZnF2:CdF2:YbF3 (1.1 at %) ceramics, contains two phases with different chemical compositions and different crystal structures. BaF2:ZnF2:CdF2:YbF3 (1.1 at %) ceramics is translucent in visible and near-IR spectrum ranges, and it is transparent in mid-IR and terahertz ranges. The spectral-kinetic properties of Yb3+ optical centers in fluoride ceramics are studied by selective laser excitation. The qualitative spectral characteristics (homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening, Stark splitting, and lifetimes) of Yb3+ optical centers are determined, and two phases with containing YbF3 as an impurity are revealed in this matrix. Two types of clustered Yb3+ optical centers with slow and short fluorescence decay are found, each in the different fluoride phase. The lifetimes of these Yb3+ centers in the first and second phases differ approximately by a factor of four (tau(77K) = 0.34/1.2 ms).

AB The preparation of N-doped carbon dots (N-CDs) was facile and efficient by the hydrothermal method, using diethylenetriamine (DETA) and citric acid (CA) as nitrogen source and carbon source, respectively. The fluorescence of N-CDs was effectively quenched by Fe3+. Upon addition of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (HH) to N-CDs/Fe3+ complex dispersion, the fluorescence of N-CDs was significantly recovered. Therefore, we developed an "off-on" fluorescence assay for the detection of HH using N-CDs/Fe3+ as a fluorescence probe. The fluorescence intensity showed linearity with the added HH concentration ranging from 0 to 100 mu M with the detection limit of 0.246 mu M (S/N = 3). The proposed N-CDs sensing showed high selectivity and sensitivity to detection HH in aqueous solution.

AB Cu2O nanoparticles decorated TiO2 thin films were fabricated by laser ablation. The effects of Cu2O nanoparticles on the structure, optical properties and photocatalytic performance of TiO2 thin film were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectrometer system, optical absorption and photocatalytic evaluation system, respectively. XRD patterns indicate that the decoration has the effect of lowering the grain orientation of Cu2O. The photocatalytic performance in hydrogen generation of Cu2O decorated TiO2 composite thin film was significantly improved compared with that of either Cu2O nanoparticles or TiO2 single layer thin film with 1.70 and 1.77 times, respectively. The oxidation of Cu2O was demonstrated to dominate the photocatalytic performances of Cu2O/TiO2 composite thin films by varying the laser ablation powers.

AB Resorcinol based reduction and capping of ultra-small colloidal silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) optimally formed hydrogen bond driven clusters within the water-based solution. Large-area self-assembled fractal structures of Ag NPs aggregates were fabricated by solvent evaporation technique on silicon substrate. The final dried surface structures were found to be pH dependent which was adjusted to particular values after the optimal reduction of silver salt, capping of Ag NPs, followed by cluster formation at an optimum pH in the solution phase. These self assembled surface structures show controlled enhancement of various surface optical phenomena such as Raman spectra of a model dye and luminescence of Ag NPs as a function of pH dependent fractal dimension of the resulting structures. The structure, morphology and various relevant optical properties of self-assembled fractals of Ag NPs were further established by combined use of X-Ray diffractometry (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), UV-Visible, photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopy analysis.

AB The spectroscopic properties of Mn4+ (3d(3)) in the La2MgGeO6 double perovskite is the subject of this investigation. The optical data have been used to perform detailed crystal field calculation of the Mn4+ energy level scheme. In La2GeMgO6, the Mn4+ can occupy either the octahedral Mg2+ or the Ge4+ sites. To address the question of site occupation, the Mn4+ energy levels were calculated when the ion substitutes for the Mg2+ and Ge4+ sites of the double perovskite lattice. An unambiguous decision on the site occupation cannot be reached based on our calculations. A comparative study of the variations in the energy of the E-2(g)->(4)A(2g) emission transition in a series of materials with the double perovskite structure is presented. The energy of the E-2(g)->(4)A(2g) emission transition tends to increase with increasing distortion of the octahedral O-Mn-O bond angle from the ideal 90 degrees.

AB A challenge in Photonics and Optoelectronics is to take advantage of specific environmental forces to enhance the nonlinear optical response of pi-organic materials. Under this statement, it is carried out a systematic QM/MC investigation of the solvent effects on the linear and nonlinear optical properties of Methyl Orange, an important azo dye. Once such properties are strongly dependent on the molecular geometries, all DFT calculations were performed on solute molecules previously obtained at the perturbative MP2 Hamiltonian. The current investigation indicates that the solute polarization due to solvent is the main factor driving all optical properties of interesting, being a suitable mechanism to tune such properties. However, the solvent acts under different manners depending on the acid-base character of the solute. For instance, in comparison to gas-phase, the UV-visible spectra of hydrated acidic Methyl Orange are blueshifted to higher energies, but for alkaline molecule, bathochromic effects are perceived. Either for static beta(total) and dynamic beta(HRS) nonlinear optical constants, the effects of the medium are also contrary with respect to its pH. In fact, beta(HRS) calculated for acidic molecules decreases from 236.20 x 10(-30) esu to 11.65 x 10(-30) esu, while for alkaline Methyl Orange, a reverse trend is found with the solvent increasing this optical property from 14.38 x 10(-30) esu to 11.65 x 10(-30) esu and becoming the alkaline structure a potential candidate for nonlinear optical applications.

AB The influence of Li self-doping effect on the structural and optical properties of LiAl5O8 was investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicated the samples present high crystalliny degree and single crystalline phase. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images showed nanosized particles disposed in agglomerates. X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) indicated that the Al local geometry is similar for both sets of samples, independent on the Li excess. X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) mapped intrinsic contaminants (Fe and Cr) from the precursors. Photoluminescence (PL) and X-ray Excited Optical Luminescence (XEOL) emission spectra presented broad bands and transitions associated with Fe3+, Cr3+ and defects from the host. XEOL excitation spectra presented positive edge and luminescent grow tendency with the increase of the excitation energy around the Al K-edge. The observed optical transitions by the excitation with X-rays, ultraviolet and visible were more expressive in the red/near infrared range.

The ability to design the film composition, structure and optical properties via changing the type of plasma discharge and energy input as well as precursor's temperature is revealed. The results obtained evidence the enlarged capability of the PECVD method developed in terms of production of As-Se-based planar structures.

AB Yttrium Aluminum Garnet transparent ceramics with different Gd3+ concentrations ((Ce0.001GdxY0.999-x)(3)Al5O12) ceramics were prepared by the conventional solid state reaction technology and vacuum sintering method, and the ceramic-based LEDs with blue LED were prepared by flip chips and Chip on board package. The extreme circumstance of-40 degrees C and 150 degrees C alternate environments, high humidity and high temperature as well as xenon lamp aging test for a long time are mentioned to explore the reliability of phosphor ceramics, respectively. And the thermostability and the effect of Gd3+ doping on the PL properties of ceramics were also investigated. What is more, the effects on the optical performance of the ceramic-based LEDs have been also investigated. As Gd3+ concentration added from 0 to 0.5, the PL spectra peaks of phosphor shifted from 542 nm to 575 nm under the excitation of 460 nm. It can be summarized that the increase of Gd3+ concentration could not improve the thermostability, but enhance the reliability when the x value is x is not greater than 0.4. What is more, the ceramics-based LED of x = 0.3 instead of x = 0.4 has the best reliability after the xenon lamp aging and thermal cycling test. And the ceramics-based LED of x = 0.45 has the best reliability after the high humidity and high temperature test. Compared with Ce:YAG and Ce:LuAG ceramics, although the increase of Gd3+ concentration decreases the thermostability and luminous efficiency, the Gd substitution can enhance the reliability and solve the lack of red light in the spectrum of Ce:YAG and Ce:LuAG ceramics, which has improved the performance of Ce:GdYAG ceramics for high-power warm white LEDs.

AB Photonic crystal fiber interferometers are widely used in sensing applications owing to their unique properties. In this research, a Photonic crystal fiber solid core Large Mode Area-10 mm based on Mach-Zehnder modal interferometer for sensing Fe element concentration in water is presented. The general structure of the sensor was realized by fusion splice Photonic crystal fiber with different lengths between two single mode fibers. The air holes at the fusion splice region are fully collapsed; thus, the core and cladding mode can be coupled and recombined. The sensor was immersed in solutions at different concentrations (2%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%) exhibited diverse refractive indices in the range of 1.3428-1.3439. The sensitivity was 42.446 nm/RIU when the Photonic crystal fiber Large Mode Area-10 mm was 1 cm, but the value changed to 44.244 and 31.654 nm/RIU with PCF lengths of 2 and 3 cm, respectively.

AB Carbonyl-functionalized indenofluorene was electropolymerized with a high faradaic efficiency of 85% and the solid state properties of the resulting polymeric thin films were investigated. They displayed modular optical properties depending on their oxidation state. The approach used for inorganic semiconductors was applied to polyindeonofluorene derivative. Mott-Schottky analysis evidenced a switching from p-type to n-type electrical conduction, suggesting an ambipolar behaviour of the polymer. As an application, flexible organic memristors were fabricated and resistive switching properties were observed.

AB As matter of course traditional silica optical fibers have been widely utilized in slow-light generation promoted by an inelastic scattering process designated as stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). We intend to explore two different configurations of the solid-core Er-doped and undoped tellurite glass triangular lattice microstructured optical fibers (T-MOFs) by using a theoretical model, for investigating the optical characteristics of slow-light generation assisted by SBS, such as effective mode area, minimum and maximum pump powers, Brillouin gain and the time delay. Also, we studied the effect of cladding parameters on effective index of the mode, and the spectral response of group velocity as well as dispersion coefficient for both geometries of the MOFs. Comparisons have been made with those numerically simulated results as available in the literature, and the relative errors are also evaluated.

AB Four rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes with 1,10-phenanthroline and derivative bearing electron-donating CH3 and OCH3 substituents were doped into host material poly (9-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) with a mass ratio of 8% as the emissive layer in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). All complexes showed photoluminescence in the solution and embedded into a PVK matrix (lambda(max)similar to 520-550 nm). The comparison with the bare PVK emission and the compound/PVK film shows that the emission of the polymer was quenched through an energy transfer process from PVK to the dopant. The electrical properties of the devices with FTO/PEDOT:PSS/Complex:PVK/Al architecture were investigated using the DC method by curves of current density-voltage and the AC method as admittance spectroscopy, which showed that the behavior of the devices is controlled by charge carrier injection rather than bulk transport.

AB Atomically thin molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been treated as a promising optoelectronic material, due to its strong photoluminescence (PL) emission. Here, we demonstrate the tunability of the PL properties of bilayer MoS2 through interlayer twist. The PL emission peak position, full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) and intensity are found to be dependent on the twisted angle, which reach their extremum for the twisted angle around 40 degrees. This PL modulation is attributed to the change of the interlayer coupling between the adjacent MoS2 layers. In addition, peak A splitting of PL spectra is found in twisted bilayer MoS2, due to the doping effect from substrate. These results enrich our understanding of the relationship between PL emission and interlayer coupling, which is significant for optical and electrical applications of twisted bilayer MoS2 (tBLM).

AB The structural environment of the V-IV ions doped in the metal-organic framework (MOF) DUT-5(Al) (((AlOH)-O-III) BPDC) was studied with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). At low V concentrations, two different vanadyl components are observed in the EPR spectrum: a broad-line component, best visible at ambient air conditions, and a narrow-line component, becoming more prominent at lower pressures. Recording the EPR spectra at both X- and Q-band, spin-Hamiltonian parameters were derived for both components. Similarities between the spectrum of the narrow-line component and the spectrum of V-IV centers in the large pore state of a related MOF, MIL-53(Al) (((AlOH)-O-III)BDC), are discussed, including their sensitivity to oxygen. The broad-line component cannot conclusively be identified by comparison with V-IV centers in MIL-53(Al). Increasing the concentration of V-IV in the DUT-5(Al) framework, a third vanadyl component appears in the spectrum, together with a broad feature related to the spectrum of COMOC-2(V) ((V-IV =O)BPDC). Surprisingly, this third component appears to be linked with a narrow pore state of the mixed-metal MOF.

AB In this research double-layer photoelectrodes including TiO2 nanocrystals (NCs) and nanorods (NRs) were fabricated and applied in quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). TiO2 mesoporous sub-layer was formed of hydrothermally grown TiO2 NCs with dominant size of 25 nm. The randomly directed inclined TiO2 NRs were also grown on the surface of the mesoporous layer through a second hydrotermal process. These could simultaneously create high surface area, enhanced light scattering and better electron transport for the double-layer photoelectrode. Mn doped CdS NCs were applied for light sensitization of the photoanode with apparent Mn/Mn + Cd molar ratio of 0-9%. Different photoelectrodes were fabricated and effect of Mn doping on sensitization and corresponding photovoltaic performance was investigated. According to the results, the optimized photoanode with Mn/Mn + Cd molar ratio of 7% represented the maximum power conversion efficiency of 3.04%. This efficiency was increased about 31% compared to the reference cell which was sensitized with undoped CdS NCs. The reason was attributed to the tunable mid-gap electron energy states created by Mn doping inside the band-gap energy of the CdS NCs and better electron transfer inside the cell.

The phonon-assisted anti-Stokes fluorescence spectra were observed at ambient and liquid nitrogen temperature. The spectroscopic results suggest that one-phonon vibronic sidebands of zero-phonon lines in impurity ions fluorescence spectra are of interest from the point of view of achieving optical refrigeration starting at ambient temperature as well as significantly below it.

AB Light-emission contributed from discrete energy levels of self-assembly InGaN quantum dots is explored to fabricate broadband light-emitting diodes (LEDs). A series of InGaN quantum dots samples are self-assembly grown on sapphire substrate by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. Emission from the discrete energy states of the InGaN quantum dots is detected by micro-zone photoluminescence under cryogenic temperature. The peaks assignments are also verified by theoretical simulation. A green LED incorporating InGaN multi-quantum dots as active medium is fabricated, demonstrating a broader emission than the referred multi-quantum wells LED. It suggests quantum dots be of great potential to improve the color-rendering index of white LEDs.

AB Organometallic lead halide perovskites are well known for its excellent and unique light-harvesting properties. This brands them as a promising candidate in almost all the optoelectronic devices. Present work demonstrates the synthesis of methylammonium lead bromide, MAPbBr(3) quantum dots (QDs) of diameter less than 4 nm and methylammonium - octylammonium lead bromide core-shell type nanoparticles (CSNPs) with a core diameter of about 1-2 nm surrounded by a shell of thickness 4 nm. The core-shell structure was confirmed from crystal structure analysis X-ray diffraction pattern, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and an increased stokes shift between absorption edge and the photoluminescence emission peak. These core-shell nanoparticles with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and color tuning ability were incorporated into poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix to form transparent nanocomposites which were highly stable, with reduced wettability and a high PLQY of 88%. PLQY stability of composites towards humidity was examined by keeping the samples fully immersed in water for 18 h, after which PMMA composites were showing PLQY similar to 83%, no considerable difference was found compared to dry composites. Dry films (kept sealed in covers) were found to be relatively stable for about one year retaining PLQY of 13%. The composite films of core-shell particles were used to demonstrate a prototype of down converting light emitting diode (LED), emitting pure green light capable of improving the quality of display devices.

AB The development of photoresponsive organoboron materials, especially visible light-responsive luminescent materials, has drawn much attention for their potential application in optoelectronics and functional biomaterials. In this study, we described a series of difluoroboron beta-diketonate complexes 1a-1e based on dithienylethene unit. Their structures have been confirmed by H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR and HRMS (ESI). And they exhibited solvent-dependent photophysical and visible light-triggered NIR photochromic properties in the solution. Simultaneously, excellent fluorescence switching behavior and photochromism were also observed in the PMMA film upon irradiation. Moreover, it was found that different substituent on the benzene ring in these complexes have a noteworthy effect on the photochromic properties and fluorescence switching behavior in the solution or PMMA film. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to provide further insight into the effect of the substituents on the photophysical and photochromic properties. Accordingly, they may be acted as novel visible light-responsive luminescent dyes for optoelectronics and functional biomaterials.

AB The steady-state infrared-photoluminescence spectra (IR-PL) emitted from about 400 pm thick, free-standing GaN wafers, grown by the ammono-thermal and hydride vapour-phase epitaxy GaN, and containing carbon, magnesium, manganese and iron doping have been examined. The room-temperature IR-PL spectra are correlated with pulsed-photo-ionization spectra using van Roosbroeck-Schockley approach for spectrum conversion. It has been revealed that iron and carbon dopants appear as the most efficient impurities for the room temperature of infra-red emission from GaN grown using different technologies.

AB In this paper, the optical properties of ZnO (0001) and ZnO (000-1) films were systematically studied. ZnO polar films were deposited on sapphire substrates by Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The morphology, structure and optical properties of the ZnO polar films were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), photoluminescence spectra (PL), absorption spectra and spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), and the results show that the bandgap obtained by SE was consistent with that obtained by absorption spectrum. Moreover, compared with ZnO (000-1) films, the optical bandgap appears red shift on ZnO (0001) films, which may be caused by impurity states near the bottom of the ZnO conduction band.

AB La-doped SnO2 thin films (1, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10%) have been coated on FTO substrates by a sol-gel spin coating technique. XRD studies confirms the (100) orientation of all prepared films of polycrystalline nature. Vibrational modes confirm the fabrication of single phase SnO2 films. EDX/SEM mapping confirms the presence of La in SnO2 films. AFM reveals the grain size in range of 17-82 nm along with RMS roughness in 13 and 38 nm. The direct band gap values of pure and La doped SnO2 thin films are varying between 4.15 and 3.95 eV. The refractive index (n) and absorption index (k) values were found to be reducing below 5% La doping and showed an increasing tendency beyond 5% doping. Further, the investigated values (chi(1)) , (chi(3)) and n(2) were found in the range of 0.032-47, 1.5 x 10(-8) to 8 x 10(-4) esu and 2.3 x 10(-7) to 1.2 x 10(-3), respectively.

AB Primary loss mechanisms in a single junction solar cell are below E-g loss and thermalization loss which limits the maximum achievable cell efficiency. In order to overcome the fundamental loss mechanisms called transmission loss due to the mismatch of the solar spectrum with the photoactive layer absorption spectrum, the up-conversion mechanism was adopted to improve the performance of organic photovoltaics. This mechanism was adopted using rare-earth nanoparticle beta-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ in P3HT and PTB7 conducting polymer-based n-i-p organic photovoltaic device. beta-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanoparticles absorb infrared (IR) photons whose wavelength approximately 980 nm and emit photons in the green wavelength region with the emission intensity maximum occurs at 520 nm and 541 nm. This non-linear optical process (up-conversion mechanism) was used in the polymer solar cell. The polymers used in this study exhibits the absorption range from similar to 300 nm to 680 nm and 300 nm-800 nm respectively for P3HT and PTB7. Using beta-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ in polymer solar cell can reduce the transmission loss through harvesting IR photons. In this study, up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) were embedded between the photoactive layer and anode interface to harvest IR light. Presence of these UCNPs assists in visible photons generation process in the vicinity of the photoactive layer which leads to the increased photo collection. Optimum loading of beta-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanoparticles in the device interface for improvement in the photocurrent and efficiency were investigated and correlated with the device optical and electrical processes. The optical process suggests that improvement in photocurrent is a synergistic effect of the up-conversion process and light scattering by beta-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+. The device with UCNPs showed absorbance improvement which suggests that backscattered light at the anode/active layer interface improve the active layer absorption. Detailed investigation of the device properties allows interpreting that the photocurrent improvement is an up conversion process as well as the scattering. In the optimized up-conversion based device, the photo-current due to up-conversion process and light scattering are of the same order. However, this can vary with respect to photoactive layer absorption properties.

AB We report the effect of strontium doping on third-order nonlinear optical properties of tin oxide (SnO2) thin films grown via chemical spray pyrolysis technique. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results reveal that films exhibit a polycrystalline phase with a tetragonal crystal structure. The broadening and shifting of diffraction peak indicate that the dopant Sr2+ ion successfully replaced the Sn sites of SnO2 lattice. The reduction of crystalline size from 23.92 to 12.96 nm indicates the assimilation of point defects such as interstitial and oxygen vacancies in the SnO2 lattice upon doping. The surface morphological analysis via atomic force microscopy indicates the shattering of grains into small particles upon Sr doping. The energy band gap of films shows a substantial drop from 3.97eV to 3.03eV due to the formation of sub-band levels in the forbidden gap. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra show intense, broad asymmetric emission bands centred around 390 nm and extending up to 500 nm. The third order nonlinear absorption mechanism observed in Sr: SnO2 films were attributed to free carrier absorption (FCA) induced two-photon absorption (TPA). The third order nonlinear absorption co-efficient beta(eff) shows a one order enhancement (0.14 x 10(-1) cm/W to 3.91 x 10(-1) cm/W) which indicates that competency of grown films in nonlinear optical device applications.

AB Crystallized Gd-2(OH)(4)SO4 center dot nH(2)O precursor was synthesized in hot water bath using oxide powders and concentrated sulfuric acid as raw materials. Calcining the precursor in air produced the intermediate product Gd2O2SO4 and Gd2O2S powders with high phase purity was obtained by hydrogen reduction. The Gd2O2S powders showed layered structure and severe agglomeration with S-BET = 6.321 m(2)/g. Using this powders, a two-step sintering method comprised of pre-sintering in vacuum and hot isostatic pressing post-treatment was introduced for the fabrication of Gd2O2S:Tb ceramics. The relative density increased from 95.7% in pre-sintered body to 99.2% in final ceramics. Densification processes and chemical homogeneity of the ceramics were discussed. Photoluminescence and X-ray excited luminescence of the final ceramics demonstrated a bright green emission centered at 545 nm due to the D-5(4)-F-7(5) transition of Tb3+.

AB The application of microfluidics for largescale rapid analytics holds great promise in the pharmaceutical diagnostics and analytical chemistry. Here we report a paper based microfluidic substrate designed by the impregnation of Silver nanoparticles. This study demonstrates the achievement of a thousand-fold increase in the successful detection level up to 10 ppb (90.8 nM) by employing Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) for the detection of Catechol. The presented sensor exhibits the following main features: (i) high specificity of enzyme (Hemocyanin)-based sensing, (ii) effective SERS sensitivity, (iii) easiness and cost-effectiveness of a paper-based platform. We rationalize these findings using the ab initio DFT simulations using Gaussian 09 whose theoretical calculations reflect the observed experimental Raman peaks.

AB (Tb1-xTmx)(3)Al5O12 transparent ceramics were successfully fabricated using solid state reaction and vacuum sintering. Influences of Tm3+ ion doping on the phase compositions, microstructure and magneto-optical characteristics of the prepared ceramics were investigated systematically. The results show that the increase in Tm3+ ion concentrations has no distinct effect on the crystal structure and average grain size of TAG ceramics. The undoped TAG transparent ceramic exhibits the best optical transmission and the optical transmittance decreases with the increase of Tm3+ doping concentrations due to the increased scattering centers. It is found that the Verdet constant of the samples increases with increasing the Tm3+ doping concentrations, which is benefit for improving the magnetic performance. The Verdet constant of 0.16 at% Tm3+-doped TAG ceramic is 189.5 rad T-1 m(-1) at 633 nm wavelength, which is 41% higher than that of commercial TGG crystal.

AB Poly (3-octylthiophene) conducting polymer and Cu-doped zinc oxide hybrid nanocomposites films were prepared by using ultrasonication cast technique. The films were characterized using various characterization techniques for their structral, vibrational, morphological, and optical properties. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) investigations suggest the presence of ZnO nanoparticles in the polymer host matrix. FTIR measurements also confirm the presence of various functional groups in the thiophene ring of poly (3-octylthipohene) polymer as well as in its nanocomposites. The UV-visible absorption spectra of polymer films exhibit the broad range absorption covering the almost whole visible region and attributed to the generation of a high density of photo-induced charge carrier by the absorption of incident photons. This is an inherent process of the polymer that appears during the absorption of the incident photons leading to the separation of bound polaron pairs that present on adjacent polymer chains as a result of inter-chain charge transfer. However, broadening in the absorption spectra of polymer is observed by incorporating Cu-ZnO nanoparticles into the polymer host matrix. This is attributed to the fact that inter-chain as well as interfacial charge transfer are responsible for photo-induced charge carriers generation; and thus it increases upon increasing in the weight percentage of nanoparticles in the polymer host matrix. The processes of inter-chain and interfacial charge transfer are well explained by developing a schematic charge transfer diagram. Furthermore, the PL emission spectra of polymer film exhibit the characteristic peaks related to the aromatic benzene ring and formed chains between the benzene ring with quinone segments of polymer. However, the PL spectra of hybrid nanocomposites film show a dramatic decrease in the intensity of emission leading the quenching effect and attributed to the high recombination rate of generated charge carriers through the Cu-ZnO induced extrinsic non-radiative recombination centers such as trap and defects. Thus, poly (3-octylthiophene) and its hybrid nanocomposite films could be considered as potential material for solar cells, diode, light emitting diodes, and resistive switching memory devices.

AB Energy efficient windows are playing an important role in view of the fabrication of Energy-Saving and Eco-Friendly devices which show high energy efficiency among energy conservation buildings. In order to modulate middle-far range infrared radiation, a new strategy based on modulating semiconducting oxides ordered array structure and coating of metal element was proposed for energy efficient windows. In this work, ZnO nanorods/Ag hybrid film with high transmittance in visible region and high reflectance in mid-infrared region was prepared via hydrothermal method and silver-mirror coating above quartz glass that has great potential application in energy efficient windows for infrared radiation cooling. In detail, ZnO nanorods arrays were prepared via in situ fabrication with spin-coating method and hydrothermal process at low temperature. While Ag nanoparticles were coated on as-prepared ZnO nanorods via a silver-mirror method which is also in line with the concept of energy conservation. According to characterization results, ZnO nanorods were grown along the wurtzite c axis perpendicular to the quartz substrate, and Ag nanoparticles were coated on ZnO nanorods with a tight interrelation. ZnO nanorods/Ag hybrid film showed high transmittance of 62% in the visible region and high reflectance above 90% in the mid-infrared region. Therefore, ZnO nanorods/Ag hybrid film obtained in this work indicates excellent optical performance in visible transmission and mid-infrared reflection, and this hybrid film is illustrated to be good candidates for saving energy in the field of energy efficient windows.

AB Dual-mode colorimetry and fluorescence detection methods have gained more attentions in recent years. In this paper, a colorimetric and fluorescent dual-mode probe was constructed based on N-doped carbon dots (CDs) that was synthesized using hydrothermal heating followed by microwave irradiation. The CDs were purified using a polarity-based method followed by a size-based method. The CDs selectively form a purple-colored complex with Fe3+ ions accompanied by quenching of the fluorescence emission. The fluorescence emission of CDs was not affected by common metal cations and anions, but was only complexed and quenched by Fe3+ ions. Cyclic voltammetry and optical spectroscopy were used to measure the HUMO and LUMO levels of the CDs. The fluorescence quenching is due to the transfer of the photo-induced electrons from the excited state of the CDs to the LUMO of Fe3+ ions. The fluorescence lifetime of CDs in the presence and absence of Fe3+ was examined by time-correlated single-photon counting. These results along with changes in the absorption spectra suggest a static fluorescence quenching mechanism. The CDs were used as a dual-readout probe for the colorimetric and fluorescent detection of Fe3+ ions in real samples. The lower limit of detection obtained using colorimetry was 0.5 mu M (S/N = 3), while that obtained using fluorimetry was 50 nM. The fluorescence intensity of the CDs is pH independent between 2 and 9, which increases the working range for practical application. Furthermore, the CDs in aqueous solution are photostable, thermostable, and stable under high ionic strength, which makes the probe robust and rugged.

AB Four different chiral imines were analyzed in solid state, by changing systematically the halogen atom -X (-F, -Cl and -Br) in the para-position of the benzene ring in the chiral moiety of benzo[b]thiophene-based imine compounds. The molecular packings showed a significant distortion induced by the effect of the stereogenic carbon atoms and the corresponding halogen atom, resulting in nonplanar angular-shaped small molecules. Morphological studies by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) were performed and changes in aspect and shape of the crystals can be clearly seen. The absorbance was registered in the UV-region (similar to 200-400 nm), and showed typical transitions that are commonly displayed in organic molecules with pi ->pi* and eta ->pi* electronic transitions. The band gap was quantified by the Tauc model, and four electronic transitions were found, associated with those observed in experimental results by absorbance, located in the similar to 3.34-5.86 eV range. By X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, a monoclinic -> orthorhombic variation in the crystals was observed. Photoluminescence (PL) signals were examined in the Vis-region at room temperature and a green emission (GE) band located in the similar to 450-750 nm range was observed, which was associated with crystalline defects and the existing chromophores. Likewise, a PL signal located in the similar to 526-583 nm (similar to 2.35-2.12 eV) range showing the shift of the green-yellow emission was noted. By using Raman spectroscopy, the vibrational modes displayed in these crystals were analyzed. A theoretical support of HOMO-LUMO analysis for these organic crystals is also reported.

AB Effects of plasmonic gap mode formation due to coupling between metal nanoparticles and thin metal film separated by thin dielectric luminescent film-spacer (gap) have been studied by means of light extinction and photoluminescence in three-layer planar Au NPs monolayer/shellac-dye film/Au film nanostructure with spacer thickness varied in the range 8-47 nm. The 3-fold enhancement of light extinction and 90 nm red shift of the plasmon mode have been observed in extinction spectra. The 37-fold enhancement of dye photoluminescence and the significant (48 nm) red shift of dye photoluminescence band have been observed for Au NPs monolayer/shellac-dye film/Au film nanostructure in comparison with bare shellac-dye film for the spacer thickness of 8 nm. The decrease of the spacer thickness causes the increase of the enhancement factor of dye photoluminescence indicating the strengthening of the gap mode field. FDTD calculations of the dependence of the intensity of the field of gap mode on the gap thickness have demonstrated good quantitative agreement with experimental data that proves the key role of gap mode in the enhancement of the electromagnetic field in planar metal NPs monolayer/dielectric film/metal film plasmonic nanocavity nanostructures. The variation of the gap thickness provides the possibility to tune controllably the spectral position and enhancement factor of the light emission from the molecular emitters located in the gap that can be used in the novel nanophotonics devices and for highly sensitive detection of the single molecules.

AB Eu2O3-doped Ca1-xBaxO-2SiO(2) glasses were prepared using standard melt-quenching technique at 1500 degrees C in CO-rich atmosphere. The changes of the Eu2+/Eu3+ ratio as a function of Ba content (x) were investigated by optical absorption, photoluminescence (PL), radioluminescence (RL) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) methods. The increase of x leads to a monotonic decrease of the absorption band related to Eu2+. On the other hand, the glass samples with a dominating Ca2+ content exhibit the strongest Eu2+ luminescence. Altogether this may point out the domination of the energy transfer from Eu2+ to Eu3+. A weak Eu2+ - and Eu3+-related emission in mixed glasses with 1-x = 0.5, 0.75 can be the result of some kind of quenching due to the mutual Ca2+ and Ba2+ influence introduced to the nearest environments of Eu ions. The role of x in the glass structure modification was confirmed also by infrared spectroscopy (IR) methods. Specific Eu2+ signals were detected in EPR spectra measured in all the glass samples with the exception of the BaO-2SiO(2) one, so only the europium 3+ charge state is expected to be present in this glass. EPR measurements thus correlate well with optical observations.

AB In this paper, two multicolor CDs have been prepared with eco-friendly folic acid and glucose as precursors by means of a facile hydrothermal strategy. The microscopic and spectroscopic results comprehensively confirmed that both of them exhibited well-defined spherical particles, amorphous structures and similar surface chemistry properties, but with different lateral dimensions and element contents. Moreover, CDs1 and CDs2 show the favorable biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity, in vitro and in vivo CLSM images of HeLa cells and zebraflsh larvae tagged with CDs1 and CDs2 revealed multicolor emission (blue, green and red) at different excitation wavelengths. More importantly, the fluorescence of CDs1 could be remarkably enhanced with the increase of Mn2+ concentration in aqueous solution through the bonding of Mn2+ with C-OH and N-H groups on the surface of CDs1. A wide linear range was obtained from 0.5 to 90 mu M with a detection limit of 0.42 mu M.

AB Optical reversible gates are required in realizing all optical digital data processing. In reversible gates, there is a one by one mapping between the input and output ports which helps us to recover the inputs from the outputs. In this paper we aim to design and propose all optical reversible XOR and XNOR gates based on electromagnetic scattering phenomenon in nonlinear photonic crystal structures. For realizing the proposed structures a special resonator was proposed which consists of two cross connected waveguides along with some linear and nonlinear defect rods. The proposed structure will be simulated using finite difference time domain method. The simulation results show that the maximum time delay for the proposed structures is about 10 ps. The truth tables for the both structures prove that there is one by one mapping between the inputs and outputs of the proposed structures.

AB Electrochromic device is a kind of device that can produce color change under the actuation of electric signal. It has attracted wide attention because of its dynamic color change properties, color diversity and convenience of driving signals. These properties highlight its potential application prospects in dynamic display, anti-counterfeiting treatment, biomedicine and other fields. In this study, stretchable photonic crystals are prepared by nano imprint technology, soft actuators made by shape memory alloy composites (SMAC) were developed based on shape memory alloy (SMA). A stretchable electrochromic device is obtained by integrating the stretchable photonic crystal and SMAC. The electrochromic properties of the device is tested under different voltages. It is found that under the voltage of 1.0 V-1.5 V, it can achieve color changing in entire visible light range, and the total deformation required is less than 30%. The properties of stretchable electrochromic devices based on SMAC is comparative analyzed with that of other electrochromic devices or structures. The results show that the proposed stretchable electrochromic device has the characteristics of low driving voltage, good compliance, wide color changing range, short response time and large effective color changing area. Finally, the excellent soft dynamic display and camouflage functions of stretchable electrochromic devices are demonstrated in a special pattern, and the high impact resistance of the device is verified. The results indicates that the proposed structure is a promising stretchable electrochromic device, which may have great potential for applications of chameleon like camouflage functional materials and devices.

AB In recent year, considerable interest has been addressed towards the high energy usage in buildings for indoor comfort due to the less energy efficient windows. Electrochromic (EC) smart window is a new technology that is capable of changing from transparent to opaque and has the potential in energy saving applications. Tungsten oxide (WO3) is a transition metal oxide with a wide range of applications which include electrochromic (EC) smart windows, displays and rear-view mirrors. In EC smart windows, WO3 is the key element where it is responsible for the colouring and bleaching of the device. Therefore the properties of WO3 will affect the EC performance. In this work, WO3 films were deposited on tin doped indium oxide (ITO) coated glasses via the sol-gel spin-coating technique. The WO3 film thicknesses were varied by means of number of deposited layers. The film thickness, morphological, structural, optical and EC properties were characterised by using step profilometer, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer and cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) measurements, respectively.

AB In this paper we focus on structural properties of As2S3-Ag glasses in phase separation region (Ag content: 0, 5, 7 at. %) using XRD technique and Raman spectroscopy and report on some application of studied glasses. X-ray diffraction experiments confirm amorphous structure of glasses. Pair distribution functions have been obtained and analyzed, and they have testified about changes in the radius of the first coordination sphere after introduction of silver into As2S3. The changes of the structure can be observed from obtained Raman spectra of doped As2S3: Ag. Compositional changes in studied chalcogenide glasses were observed in the evolution of the detected Raman bands. The main effect that is observed at introduction of silver (5, 7 at. %) into nanostructured As2S3 glass is the change of the relative concentration of the main and non-stoichiometric molecular structural units. As2S3-Ag glasses are promising for application in the photonics and optical data storages. Surface relief holographic diffraction gratings were directly recorded using composite As2S3: Ag/Se nano-multilayered structures. Diffraction efficiency values in transmission of recorded gratings is similar to 22%.

AB Phenyl substitution in two different positions on pyrazoline ring bearing pyrene luminescent materials were synthesized (PP3M and PP5M) and their structure property relationship investigated. TGA results indicate good thermal stability up to 368 degrees C and 357 degrees C for PP3M and PP5M respectively. DSC and PXRD analysis confirm the existence between amorphous and crystalline nature. The small changes in position of molecular structure brought interesting emission properties in solution state as sky-blue (lambda em = 438 nm) and green (lambda em = 510 nm) color while emission in solid state as sky-blue (lambda em = 537 nm) and yellow (lambda em = 593 nm) color of PP3M and PP5M respectively. The PP3M exhibiting dual emission in solution and solid states are ascribed to twisted intramolecular charge transfer process. The decay of excited state displays shorter and longer values of 1.0 ns and 3.14 ns? The optical band gap decides color emission owing to conjugation length playing major role and their data suggesting semiconducting properties. With increasing polarity of the solvents the dipolemoment changes resulting in intramolecular charge transfer process and this is well understood from the large Stokes shift observed ascribed to solvatochromism. The emission color purities were compared in solution for PP3M and PP5M with standardized color purity values by NTSC. Third order nonlinear optical properties of luminophores were investigated by Z-scan studies refers saturable absorption and self-defocusing nature. Their HOMO-LUMO energy level values were experimentally calculated by electrochemical studies which are in accordance with theoretical values from DFT analysis. Further, DFT geometries reveal twisted molecular geometry of PP3M and PP5M in the ground state.

AB The paper discusses the potential of several Yb-doped scheelite-like double tungstate crystals for sunlight down conversion. Four hosts NaY(WO4)(2), NaY1/2Gd1/2(WO4)(2), NaY2/3Gd1/3(WO4)(2), and NaY(Mo1/2W1/2O4)(2) with the same 10% at. Yb doping level were comparatively investigated. Besides that, the effect of increase the Yb concentration from 10 at.% to 15 at.% was checked in case of NaY(WO4)(2) crystal host. The efficient ytterbium 900-nm broadband emission was obtained under ultraviolet excitation, despite the absence of Yb absorption lines in this range. This happens due to non-radiative energy transfer from donor centers of the hosts to Yb active ions. This absorption wavelengths range of the host can be tuned by changing the crystal chemical composition. The obtained results indicate that the family of Yb-doped scheelite-like double tungstates is a suitable candidate for developing down-converter materials for solar energy applications.

AB Well-defined Fe3O4@SiO2 composite colloidal particles decorated with Ag nanoparticles were successfully synthesized through a simple chemical approach. These particles self-assembled into 1D chain-like photonic structures under the induction of magnetic field and diffract tunable structural colors. The hue and brightness of the structural colors are related to Ag nanoparticles deposited on the particles surface and its brightness increases with the increase of Ag concentration. This phenomenon could be the result of the superposition of photonic bandgap formed by photonic crystals and possible plasmonic property, as well as capability in absorbing stray light of Ag nanoparticles. As-prepared Fe3O4@SiO2@Ag colloidal particles have great potential to be applied in many crucial areas such as color displaying, biological detection and anti-counterfeiting technology.

AB The third-generation organic solar cells have the benefits of low-cost, solution processability, low energy payback time, environment friendliness and appropriateness for mass production via large area printing techniques. The electron transport layer improves the ohmic contact between the cathode and the photoactive layer. In this research article, we demonstrate a drop on demand inkjet printing of the zinc oxide electron transport layer and the photoactive layer blend consisting of a donor poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) and acceptor Indene C-60 bisadduct (ICBA) of an organic solar cell. Consequently, all inkjet printed solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 4.7% under ambient conditions. We highlighted that drop spacing, substrate temperature and the waveform parameters such as voltage and time are the important parameters for printing. Moreover, we observed a difference in morphology between spin coated and inkjet printed devices as characterized via UV-Visible absorbance, atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, we applied device characterization from impedance spectroscopy to elucidate the difference in device performance. Particularly, the effective lifetime and global mobilities calculated from the impedance spectroscopy Nyquist plots at 1 Voltage bias in the dark for all inkjet-printed devices are 0.0374 mu s and 57.5 x 10(-3) cm(2)/V-S respectively, and for all, spin-coated devices are 0.0628 mu s and 115.3 x 10(-3) cm(2)/V-S respectively.

AB Holmium (Ho3+) -doped bismuth-germanate glasses with the chemical combination of (40-x) GeO2 + 20 Bi2O3 + 20 Na2O + 10 Gd2O3 + 10 BaO + x Ho2O3 (x = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.5) have been prepared by melt quenching method. These glasses were characterized for spectroscopic properties through optical absorption, photoluminescence excitation and photoluminescence emission. Judd-Ofelt (JO) intensity (Omega(lambda), lambda = 2, 4, 6), and radiative parameters were evaluated with the help of the absorption spectra. Intense emission band was observed at a wavelength of 548 nm in the green region compared to other emission bands. Stimulated emission cross-section of GeBiNaGdBaH was found to be 0.18 x 10(-20) cm(2) and compared with other reported glasses. High lifetime of the S-5(2)+F-5(4) level is reported as 25 mu s for the GeBiNaGdBaH15 glass. The CIE chromaticity diagram has demonstrated the strong emission for the GeBiNaGdBaH glasses in the green region at around 548 nm, and suggest that the glasses could be useful for green lighting applications.

AB Examination of the local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of precious metals shows that combining noble metal nanomaterials and upconversion (UC) materials increases the luminescence quantum yield and luminescence stability of UC materials. Furthermore, this combination reduces the luminescence lifetime. In this study, a new type of UC luminescent material, Ag@SiO2@YF3:Ho3+, was synthesized. The SiO2 group was used to protect the YF3:Ho3+ group from Ag. In addition, Ag@SiO2 nuclear shell structure model was constructed using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation software. Ag particle size and SiO2 shell thickness, the parameters of the LSPR resonance peak that most improved the luminous intensity of the UC material, were calculated theoretically. Finally, the composite photocatalyst, Ag@SiO2@YF3:Ho3+@TiO2, was obtained by combining the LSPR-enhanced UC material with the photocatalyst TiO2. The FDTD simulation results showed that the conditions using a Ag particle radius of 75-125 nm and a SiO2 shell thickness of 20 nm most greatly enhanced the luminescence of the UC material YF3:Ho3+, which was deposited on top of the Ag@SiO2 shell structure. Ag@SiO2@YF3:Ho3+ prepared under these conditions possessed a core-shell structure in which the diameter of the Ag core was 150-250 nm and the composite shell, after loading TiO2, was divided into three layers. Furthermore, the results demonstrated the successful fabrication of the UC materials and composite materials. Finally, degradation experiments showed that a desirable photodegradation effect (76%) was obtained and the degradation rate of the dark reaction was 18%.

AB The identification of candidate protective antigens for the development of tick vaccines may be approached by selecting antigen candidates that play key biological functions. Tick midgut proteins that play essential functions in tick survival and disease transmission are upregulated in response to blood feeding and digestion. In this study, Ornithodoros erraticus midgut transcriptomic and proteomic data upon feeding were inspected to select functionally relevant antigens to be assessed as vaccine candidate antigens. For this, we primarily focused on proteins with relevant biological functions in key physiological processes for ticks and tick-host-pathogen interactions. Later, we used additional criteria based on overexpression after feeding, predicted antigenicity and cellular localisation, resulting in the selection of four theoretical candidates, two aquaporins (OeAQP, OeAQP1), one ABC transporter (OeABC) and one selenoprotein T (OeSEL). Rabbit vaccination with synthetic immunogenic peptides designed from the extracellular antigenic regions of the selected candidates induced humoral responses that reduced tick feeding and reproduction performance. Both AQPs and OeSEL demonstrated significant protection efficacy against the homologous species O. erraticus, but lower non-significant cross-species protection against Ornithodoros moubata. Conversely, OeABC showed no protection against the homologous species O. erraticus, but significant cross-species protection against O. moubata. These results are the first demonstration of the protective potential of argasid aquaporins, suggesting that they might be included in vaccines for the control of multiple tick species. Additionally, these results also unveiled two novel protective antigens from argasid ticks, OeABC and OeSEL, belonging to functional protein families that have never been explored as a source of vaccine candidates and are deserving of further studies. Finally, our data add value to the midgut as a protective candidate antigen source in argasids for the control of tick infestations.

AB Aelurostrongylus abstrusus (Nematoda, Metastrongyloidea) is a worldwide occurring lungworm causing verminous pneumonia in cats. To date the Baermann method is the most used procedure to diagnose A. abstrusus infection by isolating first stage larvae from faeces, though its sensitivity and specificity can be impaired by several factors. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of antibodies against A. abstrusus has been recently developed as a diagnostic alternative. The present study evaluated the seroprevalence for A. abstrusus infection in cats from two endemic areas of Italy. Overall, 250 sera were sampled and tested for the presence of antibodies against A. abstrusus. Based on the results obtained from 20 cats proven to be infected by A. abstrusus using Baermann technique and molecular methods, and from 20 negative cats (Subset A), a cut off value of 0.347 optical density (OD) was determined, leading to a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 100%. Two-hundred and ten cats (142 and 68 from Abruzzo and Umbria regions, respectively) were included in Subset B (i.e. 202 negative by Baermann examination and 8 positive for Troglostrongylus brevior). Antibodies against A. abstrusus were detected in forty-five (21.4%, 95% CI: 16.1-27.6%) samples. This study confirms the occurrence of A. abstrusus in endemic areas of Italy and indicates that one-fifth of randomly selected cats have or had a lungworm infection with production of antibodies.

AB In this study we aimed to evaluate the effect of Trichostrongylus colubriformis infection on digesta passage rate, rumen fermentation and lamb performance. Eighteen three-month-old Santa Ines castrated male lambs (16.9 +/- 1.43 kg of body weight) were randomly distributed in two experimental treatments: Infected with T. colubriformis (I, n = 9) and Uninfected (U, n = 9). The I lambs received a total of 45,000 L-3 larvae of T. colubriformis (5,000 infective larvae, three times per week for three weeks). Daily feed intake was assessed using the I lambs as a reference for their respective pairs on the U group (pair-fed). Weight, body condition score and faeces (stool) samples were obtained every 15 days for 75 days. In both treatments, faecal egg count (FEC), digesta passage rate, rumen fermentation parameters, protozoa count and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) were evaluated. The lambs presented moderate infection (FEC = 620). The retention time of the digesta in the rumen-reticulum segment was lower (P < 0.05) in I lambs. The I lambs presented no inappetence, however, lower concentrations of total SCFA and butyrate, while higher acetate concentration were observed in these lambs (P < 0.05). The present findings highlight that T. colubriformis infection decreased the retention time (solid and liquid content) of the digesta in the rumen-reticulum, as well as negatively affected lamb growth.

AB Nematodes belonging to the Trichuris genus are prevalent soil-transmitted helminths with a worldwide distribution in mammals, while humans are mainly affected in areas with insufficient sanitation such as in Africa, Asia and South America. Traditionally, whipworms infecting primates are referred to Trichuris trichiura, but recent molecular and morphological evidence suggests that more than one species may be able to infect humans and non-human primates. Here, we analyzed the genetic diversity and phylogeny of Trichuris infecting five different non-human primate species kept in captivity using sequencing of three mitochondrial genes (cox1, rrnL and cob).
   Phylogenetic analyses of both single and concatenated datasets suggested the presence of two main evolutionary lineages and several highly supported clades likely existing as separate taxa. The first lineage included Trichuris infecting the mantled guereza (Colobus guereza kikuyensis), the chacma baboon (Papio ursinus) and the green monkeys (Chlorocebus spp.), clustering together with Trichuris suis; the second lineage included Trichuris infecting the Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata) and the hamadryas baboon (Papio hamadryas), clustering together with Trichuris spp. infecting humans. These results were supported by the genetic distance between samples, which suggested that at least two taxa are able to infect macaques, baboons and humans.
   The present study improves our understanding of the taxonomy and evolutionary relationships among Trichuris spp. infecting primates. It moreover suggests that multiple Trichuris spp. may circulate among host species and that Trichuris in non human primates (NHPs) may be zoonotic. Further studies are important to better understand the epidemiology of Trichuris in primates and for implementing appropriate control and/or conservation measures.

AB The lesswright (lwr) gene and its products are essential molecules in mitosis, DNA repair, and embryo formation in many eukaryotes. In this study, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the Lwr protein was located in the internal tissues and the surface layer of the adult Schistosoma japonicum (Sj) worms. The mRNA expression levels of SjLwr at different points were evaluated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The expression of SjLwr peaked at 14 days and then decreased thereafter. SjLwr expression was relatively more stable in male worms than in female worms. The functions of SjLwr were explored by siRNA-based gene silencing with a simple soaking method. The results showed that knockdown of the SjLwr gene impaired the growth and development of S. japonicum in mice, as well as survival, morphology, reproductive capacity, and egg vitality. These observations imply that SjLwr presents a novel target for the development of immuno- and/or small molecule-based therapeutics for the control and treatment of schistosome infections.

AB In this study we evaluated the efficacy of trichlorfon against Haemonchus contortus, monitoring its influence on blood parameters and plasma enzymes of lambs with haemonchosis. A lamb group was orally treated with trichlorfon at 100 mg kg(-1) while the other group was untreated. Split-plot design analysis was performed with the lamb groups defined as plots while the subplots were the four periods (weeks) of collection. The trichlorfon treatment promoted a significant and effective reduction of fecal egg counts after one week, with efficacies > 99%. After 21 days of treatment, detected blood parameters and serum levels of plasma enzymes were normal. Additionally, serum albumin and urea concentrations increased to normal values, which were not observed in untreated lambs. The treatment with this organophosphate, using a correct oral administration, may represent an effective therapeutic alternative for sheep infected with multi resistant strain of H. contortus.

AB In the present study, a quantitative proteomic approach to study changes in saliva proteins associated with canine leishmaniosis (CanL) was performed. For this, canine salivary proteins were analysed and compared between dogs before (TO) and after (T1) experimental infection with Leishmania infantum by high-throughput label-based quantitative LC-MS/MS proteomic approach and bioinformatic analysis of the in silico inferred interactome protein network was created from the initial list of differential proteins. More than 2000 proteins were identified, and of the 90 differentially expressed proteins between TO and T1, 12 were down-regulated with log2 fold change lower than -0.5849, and 19 were up-regulated with log2 fold change greater than 0.5849. This study provides evidence of changes in salivary proteome that can occur in canine leishmaniosis and revealed biological pathways in saliva modulated in canine leishmaniosis with potential for further targeted research.

AB The detection and quantification of nematode eggs using fecal egg count techniques have an irreplaceable role in equine parasitic control. The reliability, particularly precision and accuracy, of individual techniques have been described only for strongylid infections. The aim of this study was to compare three fecal egg count techniques used for the detection of the two most common equine nematode infections: strongylid and ascarid. The Simple McMaster, Concentration McMaster and Mini-FLOTAC techniques were tested on spiked fecal samples with various levels of egg concentration (50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 3000 eggs per gram) and naturally infected mixed strongylid-ascarid samples with 30 replicates. The Simple McMaster, Concentration McMaster and Mini-FLOTAC techniques had precision coefficients of variation of 44.33, 35.64 and 18.25% for the strongylid infection and 62.95, 35.71 and 18.95% for the ascarid infection, and percent accuracies (mean count/number of eggs spiked) of 97.53, 88.39 and 74.18% for the strongylid infection and 65.53, 83.18 and 90.28% for the ascarid infection, respectively. Accuracy depended greatly on the type of nematode, but precision did not. The Mini-FLOTAC technique was more precise than the Simple and Concentration McMaster techniques regardless of nematode type. Simple McMaster was the most accurate technique for detecting strongylid eggs, and Mini-FLOTAC was the most accurate technique for detecting ascarid eggs. Our results indicated that none of the current techniques were universally and sufficiently reliable for the simultaneous quantification of both of these common equine nematodes.

Accordingly, a significant amount of research is currently dedicated to the development of appropriate antigens for use in rapid and accurate coenurosis diagnosis kits. In the present study, antigen B (AgB) and thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx) from T. multiceps were cloned and expressed using a prokaryotic system, molecular characterization of Tm-AgB was determined by bioinformatical analyses. The serological diagnostic potentials of rTm-AgB and rTm-TPx were evaluated by indirect ELISA and compared with those of previously reported rTm-AnxB2, rTm-HSP70, and rTm-GST. The results showed that Tm-AgB is a specific lipoprotein of cestodes with good thermal stability. The ELISA assay showed that rTm-AgB exhibited a sensitivity of 95.8% and a specificity of 87.5%, indicating its strong potential for serological diagnosis of T. multiceps.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the mite fauna and their ecological interactions in commercial laying hen farms in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. It was conducted from August 2013 through August 2014 with two sampling strategies (feathers and traps) in three different production systems: automated (A(1,2,3)), semi-automated (S-1,S-2) and free-range (FR). A total of 38,383 mites were collected belonging to 23 families and 33 species, most of which were collected in feathers (74%) followed by traps (26%). There was higher abundance at S1 (10,774-28.1%) and S-2 (11,023-28.7%) followed by FR (6972-18.2%), A(1) (1896-4.9%), A(2) (4775-12.4%), and A(3) (2943-7.7%). Higher richness was observed at S-1 (23 species), S-2 (18 species), and FR (19 species). Megninia ginglymura (Megnin) (Analgidae) was the species with the highest health importance, eudominant on feathers, and its populations seems to be related with increased temperature. Tuccioglyphus setosus Horn et al. (Pyroglyphidae) seems to be influenced by relative air humidity and temperature. Predators with the highest populations were Cheyletus malaccensis (Oudemans) (Cheyletidae), Typhlodromus transvaalensis (Nesbitt) (Phytoseiidae), Blattisocius keegani (Fox), and Blattisocius dentriticus (Berlese) (Blattisocidae).

AB Monogeneans Gyrodactylus von Nordmann 1832, cause outbreaks of gyrodactylosis in aquaculture settings worldwide. Detection of Gyrodactylus spp. is based on the morphological identification of isolated parasites after fish necropsy. Contributing to the diagnosis of gyrodactylosis, in this study, a non-destructive PCR assay was standardized; the PCR was first performed using genomic DNA of Gyrodactylus spp. isolated from the surface of the Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus 1758), and subsequently tested with mucus samples of infected and uninfected Nile tilapia fish. The primers (Ekgyrol) were designed from the ribosomal Internal Transcriber Spacer (ITS) RNA region (ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2 rRNA gene) of Gyrodactylus cichlidarum Paperna 1968. The positive control group included the DNA of 30 monogeneans Gyrodactylus spp. The heterologous control group included 75 monogeneans Cichlidogyrus Paperna 1960, 75 protozoans Ichthyophthirius multifiliis Fouquet 1876 and 75 Trichodina Ehrenberg 1830. PCR products of each parasite and from the external mucus samples (described as P and M respectively), were sequenced. The average DNA concentration of the ectoparasites was of 13.5 ng/mu l. The PCR test had an analytical sensitivity of 0.0039 ng mu l-1 of DNA of Gyrodactylus spp. No cross reactions were observed with the heterologous group. The sensitivity and specificity of the PCR test were of 100% either with genomic DNA or with DNA from mucus samples. Six DNA consensus sequences with sizes ranging from 568 bp to 571 bp were obtained and the BLAST analysis matched with DNA sequences of G. cichlidarum.

AB The astigmatid mite Psoroptes ovis (Acari: Proroptidae) causes the highly contagious and debilitating ovine disease, sheep scab. This ectoparasitic infection has a high economic and animal welfare impact on British sheep farming. Following recent work demonstrating resistance of Psoroptes mites to moxidectin, a widely used macrocyclic lactone (ML) treatment for scab, the current study compared the toxicity of three of the commonly administered macrocylic lactone therapeutic treatments (moxidectin, ivermectin and doramectin) to P. ovis from outbreak populations that had appeared unresponsive to treatment. These outbreak populations were from Wales and south west England. The data presented demonstrate that there is resistance to all three available ML compounds in populations of Psoroptes mites. However, considerable variation in response suggested that resistance alone was not responsible for the reported lack of efficacy in all of the submitted cases; lack of response in others may be associated with inappropriate treatment application or management. These data highlight the importance of the appropriate use of these compounds to manage national scab incidence at levels that are consistent with acceptable animal welfare standards, while attempting to reduce the development and spread of resistance.

AB Establishing the efficacy of an anti-coccidial drug in poultry begins with conducting multiple battery cage studies, where the target animals are challenged with single and mixed Eimeria species inoculum under controlled laboratory conditions. One of the primary outcomes in a battery cage study is the intestinal lesion score defined on a discrete ordinal scale of 0 to 4. So far, the statistical analysis of lesion scores has routinely employed the linear mixed model (LMM). This present work proposes to apply the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with the cumulative logit link to statistically analyze coccidial lesion scores collected from battery cage studies. Upon applying this new approach on 9 datasets generated by challenging battery-cage-housed broilers with various mixtures of Eimeria species, it is observed that the GLMM fitted adequately to the data, produced variance component estimates that agreed with the experimental setup, and, at the 0.05 significance level, generated statistical results in complete concordance with the LMM approach. Advantages of the proposed GLMM over the LMM are discussed from several standpoints. Parallel to the regulatory requirement of a >= 1-unit reduction in the mean lesion score for clinical relevant efficacy under the LMM, the clinical relevancy criterion under the GLMM could be set as a >= 10-fold increase in the odds of having low lesion scores. That is, the effect of an anti-coccidial drug product would be deemed clinically relevant in battery-cage studies when the odds of having low lesion scores with the medication is 10 times or more than the odds without the medication.

AB Introduction: Bleomycin pulmonary toxicity (BPT) is a potentially life-threatening consequence of bleomycin usage in patients. An overproduction of epithelium-derived cytokines, habitually linked to allergic inflammation, has been recently revealed in experimental models of BPT.
   Methods: We assessed retrospectively our cohort of patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma treated with bleomycin between 2014 and 2016 for their demographic, clinical features, including BPT development, atopy status and risk factors for BPT. Then they were invited for allergy testing and blood sample collection. The samples were stimulated with different stimuli (Bleomycin, IL-33, TSLP) for 24 h on cell culture. The culture supernatants were analysed for TGF-beta, Galectin3, Arginin, Amphiregulin, Eotaxin, IFN gamma, TNF alpha, IL1 beta, 4, 5, 6, 10, 13, 17, MIP-1 alpha, and bleomycin hydrolase (BLH) levels.
   Results: The cohort consisted of 51 patients showed that atopy was the only significant risk factor for BPT occurrence (OR: 7.2, p=0.007). Fourteen subjects were included for blood analysis. The analysis of supernatants at the unstimulated condition revealed that BLH and Amphiregulin were significantly lower in patients who had BPT than controls. The BLH cut-off that best identified a history of BPT was 175.31 (Sensitivity: 62.5%, specificity: 100%). Following the stimulation, BLH reduced compared to the unstimulated condition and the difference between groups remained significant (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Our study is the first to report that low levels of bleomycin hydrolase in allergic individuals may be predisposing to a possible pathway of fibrosis.

AB Background: Although many studies have highlighted the link between asthma/rhinitis and depression, it is still unclear which characteristics of these diseases are associated with the risk of depression. We aimed to explore the relationship between depression and asthma or rhinitis in a representative sample of the Italian general population.
   Methods: The data were collected in GEIRD, an Italian multicenter, population-based, multicase-control study. 2227 participants (age 21-86 years, female 50%) underwent standardized interviews, skin prick and lung function tests, and were divided into cases of current asthma (n=528), rhinitis without asthma (n=972), and controls (n=727). Two specific questions from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) were asked to identify symptoms of depressed mood and anhedonia, which were used as a proxy of major depression disorder.
   Results: The prevalence of depression was 16.7%, 11.9%, and 5.1% in subjects with asthma, rhinitis and controls, respectively. Both in asthma and rhinitis, subjects with depression had worse respiratory-health related quality of life and more frequent disease-related symptoms than their non-depressed counterparts. In asthma, depression was associated with poorer disease control. In rhinitis, depression was significantly associated with a disease-related limitations in daily activities and greater risk of symptom exacerbations and prescriptions of medicines for breathing. Cases of rhinitis with depression were less likely to be atopic.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that rhinitis exacerbations, particularly in non-atopic subjects, and low asthma control are strongly related to the presence of depressed mood in adults from the general population.

TI Automatic tailoring of the lowest PEEP to abolish tidal expiratory flow
   limitation in seated and supine COPD patients
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Lung function monitoring; Forced oscillation technique; Non-invasive
   ventilation; Intrinsic PEEP; Supine position
ID PRESSURE SUPPORT VENTILATION; FORCED OSCILLATION; ASSOCIATION
AB Rationale: In COPD patients, the development of tidal expiratory flow limitation (EFLT) results in intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi), leading to increased work of breathing and worsening patient-ventilator interaction. An external PEEP can mitigate these consequences, but how to optimize its value it is still unknown.
   Objective: To measure the minimum PEEP able to abolish EFLT by a new automatic non-invasive ventilation (NIV) mode in stable hypercapnic COPD patients in the seated and supine positions.
   Methods: Twenty-six hypercapnic COPD patients (mean +/- SD: FEV1%pred=39.2 +/- 16.1, FEV1/FVC% pred=46.3 +/- 16.3%) were studied while receiving NIV during two consecutive 15-min periods, with patients studied seated in the first and supine in the second. A ventilator able to identify EFLT breath-by-breath by using the forced oscillation technique optimized in real-time PEEP to the lowest pressure able to abolish EFLT (PEEPO).
   Results: The ventilator was always able to identify a PEEPO. Its values were highly variable among patients and increased from median(iqr) 4.0 (0.03) (range: 4.0-8.3cmH(2)O) to 6 (6.1) cmH(2)O (range: 4.0-15.7 cmH(2)O) when patients moved from the seated to the supine position, respectively. PEEPO in supine position did not correlate to any spirometric or anthropometric variable.
   Conclusions: PEEPO in COPD patients is highly variable and increases in supine position. It is not predicted by spirometric nor anthropometric variables, but had a considerable variability among the patients. We suggest that PEEPo may be used as a phenotyping variable in COPD patients.

ID SURVIVAL; FIBROSIS; ANTIGEN
AB Introduction: The causes of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) in the UK are changing as working practices evolve, and metalworking fluid (MWF) is now a frequently reported causative exposure. We aimed to review and describe all cases of HP from our UK regional service, with respect to the causative exposure and diagnostic characteristics.
   Methods: In a retrospective, cross-sectional study, we collected patient data for all 206 cases of HP diagnosed within our UK-based regional NHS interstitial and occupational lung disease service, 2002-17. This included demographics, environmental and occupational exposures, clinical features, and diagnostic tests (CT imaging, bronchiolo-alveolar cell count, lung function, histology). We grouped the data by cause (occupational, non-occupational and unknown) and by presence or absence of fibrosis on CT, in order to undertake hypothesis testing.
   Results: Cases were occupational (n=50), non-occupational (n=56) or cryptogenic (n=100) in aetiology. The commonest causes were birds=37 (18%) and MWF=36 (17%). Other occupational causes included humidifiers and household or commercial waste, but only one case of farmers' lung. Cryptogenic cases were associated with significantly older age, female gender, lower lung function parameters, fewer alveolar lymphocyte counts>20%, and fibrosis on CT; exposure information was missing in 22-33% of cryptogenic cases.
   Conclusion: MWF is the commonest occupational cause of HP, where workers usually present with more acute/subacute features and less fibrosis on CT; refuse work is an emerging cause. Cryptogenic HP has a fibrotic phenotype, and a full occupational history should be taken, as historical workplace exposures may be relevant.

AB Introduction: Improved understanding of genetic effects on response to treatments with novel approaches for COPD with peripheral blood eosinophilia, such as mepolizumab (a humanized monoclonal antibody to IL-5), may improve treatment outcomes. We conducted a study to identify genetic variants associated with efficacy of mepolizumab COPD.
   Materials and methods: Using generalized linear and logistic regression models, genome-wide association analyses were performed to investigate genetic associations with frequency of moderate and/or severe COPD exacerbations in COPD subjects receiving mepolizumab (weeks 0-52). Additional analyses included: (i) frequency of COPD exacerbations requiring hospitalization or emergency department visit (weeks 0-52), (ii) change from baseline mean total St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score (week 24), and (iii) SGRQ response defined as achieving a 4 unit or greater decrease of SGRQ score from baseline (week 24). This study included 610 patients with COPD, a subset of the Intent-to-treat (ITT) populations in two phase III double-blind trials assessing the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab, METREX (NCT02105948) and METREO (NCT02105961). All subjects had elevated eosinophil levels (>= 150 cells/mu L at screening or >= 300 cell/mu L in the 12 months prior to study), were treated with mepolizumab, and provided consent for genetic analysis.
   Results: From this post-hoc analysis, no genetic variant was significantly associated with moderate and/or severe COPD exacerbations or any of the other endpoints tested (threshold for statistical significance at the genome-wide level, p=5x10(-8)).
   Conclusions: In this exploratory study in patients with COPD, with peripheral blood eosinophilia, no genetic effects on mepolizumab-treatment response were identified.

TI Peak post-transplant lung function in bilateral lung transplant
   recipients using a prediction model based on donor and recipient
   demographic characteristics
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Bilateral lung transplant; Pulmonary function testing; Lung function
ID PULMONARY-FUNCTION; REFERENCE VALUES; SPIROMETRY; HEART; COMPLICATIONS
AB Rationale: There are no reliable methods to predict lung function following lung transplantation. We sought to devise a prediction model of peak pulmonary function testing (PFT) post-transplant based on donor and recipient demographic characteristics.
   Methods: Single center retrospective analysis of bilateral lung transplant recipients between 2011 and 2015 without evidence of allograft dysfunction in the first year was performed. Peak PFT post-transplant was determined by serially measured FEV1 and FVC. Using the NHANES III equation, donor demographic characteristics were used to calculate predicted lung function. Multivariable linear regression helped determine which donor and recipient characteristics affected peak lung function and identify the discrepancy between donor predicted and recipient observed PFT post-transplant.
   Results: 146 donor/recipient patients were analyzed. 80 had obstructive lung disease, 66 had restrictive disease. Peak post-transplant FEV1 and FVC was reached in 64.30 +/- 48.96 and 78.14 +/- 50.68 weeks, respectively. Spirometry values peaked earlier in restrictive lung disease recipients. Higher peak FEV1 was significantly associated with younger donor age, non-African American donor race, male recipient sex, greater recipient height, underlying obstructive lung disease. Greater absolute differences between donor predicted and observed FEV1 were significantly associated with male donor sex, greater donor height, non-African-American donor race, female recipient sex, greater recipient height.
   Conclusions: Donor and recipient characteristics can help predict lung function post-transplant. Patients without complications in the first year post-transplant may take greater than one year to achieve peak lung function. Such predictions can help guide clinical decision making in the right setting.

AB Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited genetic disorder with multiorgan involvement. Gastrointestinal tract dysfunction leads to fat and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) malabsorption and deficiency of these vitamins. Subclinical vitamin K (VK) deficiency seems to be a common problem in CF patients. However, despite the rest of fat-soluble vitamins being routinely supplemented, this is not a universal clinical practice for VK. Inefficient levels of VK may have significant effects on blood coagulation and bone formation. There are also some data indicating that VK may play a key role on regulation of inflammation. Supplementing CF patients with VK seems rational, but the appropriate dosing regimens are still a matter of debate. This review will try to delineate the problem and communicate the latest opinions on this controversial issue.

AB Rationale: The concept of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) was recently proposed by the American Thoracic Society. However, the clinical significance of the serologic domain of IPAF has not yet been established in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
   Objectives: We aimed to investigate the clinical significance of autoantibody positivity in IPF.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 512 patients diagnosed as IPF from January 2007 through March 2014. The patients were divided into two subgroups: (i) an autoantibody-positive IPF subgroup (n=138), consisting of patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) or autoantibodies that met the criteria for the IPAF serologic domain; (ii) a lone IPF subgroup (n=374), consisting of the rest of the IPF patients.
   Measurements and main results: Autoantibody-positivity (HR 0.736, p=0.043) was an independent risk factors for 5-year mortality on multivariable analysis in the overall IPF patients. In the autoantibody-positive IPF patients, use of glucocorticoid (not for management of acute exacerbation, HR 2.121, p=0.019), use of immunomodulators (HR 0.310, p=0.002), malignancy (HR 3.359, p=0.002), baseline forced vital capacity (HR 0.974, p=0.017), baseline diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (HR 0.981, p=0.041), and baseline 6-min walk test distance (HR 0.996, p=0.002) were independent risk factors for 5-year mortality.
   Conclusions: Presence of ANCA or autoantibodies of the IPAF serologic domain in IPF patients is associated with better survival outcomes, and the use of immunomodulators is associated with superior survival outcomes.

This retrospective review of 136 patients undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery identified 21 patients who had PFTs despite MI in the preceding month (MI + PFT group). The MI + PFT Group had zero incidence of MI or serious cardiac arrhythmia between PFTs and surgery. Comparison of post-operative outcomes between the MI + PFT Group and all other CABG patients showed no significant differences. In this small sample size, PFTs appear safe within one month of MI.

AB Purpose: No studies have investigated genetic effects on quality of life (QoL) measurements like improvements in the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatments with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FSC). Therefore, in addition to testing genetic effects on change from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), genetic associations that may predict SGRQ response to FSC treatment were investigated in this analysis.
   Methods: This post hoc exploratory genome-wide genetic analysis included subjects from 10 clinical trials: NCT01772134, NCT01772147, NCT00633217, NCT01817764, NCT01879410, NCT01822899, NCT01323621, NCT01342913, NCT01323634, and NCT01706328. The Genetics Analysis Population (subjects who provided written consent, a blood sample for genetic research, and were successfully genotyped) included 2005/2900 subjects in the intent-to-treat sample, who received FSC, for testing association with change from baseline in trough FEV1 and 1188/2005 subjects for testing SGRQ responses (change from baseline SGRQ score and categorical response by SGRQ score with Responders achieving > 4 unit decrease at end of study treatment).
   Main findings: One locus on chromosome 20 with seven variants with low minor allele frequencies significantly associated with change from baseline SGRQ score. The binary SGRQ response provided similar trends for association but did not attain genome-wide significance levels. No genetic association was detected with change from baseline in trough FEV1.
   Conclusions: Common variants are unlikely to play a role in response to FSC.

AB Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is the only available point of care test to assess type-2 inflammation in asthma. In making a diagnosis of asthma, FeNO should be used together with blood eosinophils and spirometry, alongside a history. Raised FeNO in conjunction with blood eosinophilia are treatable traits of type 2 inflammation in asthma, which in turn may guide personalised management. A FeNO suppression test can be used to assess adherence and device use with ICS therapy. Furthermore FeNO may be used to provide feedback to patients in response to ICS, especially when spirometry is normal. FeNO may facilitate appropriate referral to secondary care for more definitive specialist investigations. In summary, FeNO is cost effective in the diagnosis and management of asthma and should be incorporated into primary and secondary care as part of routine clinical practice.

TI Safety of tiotropium Respimat (R) in black or African-American patients
   with symptomatic asthma
SO RESPIRATORY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Asthma; Black or african american; Adult; Pediatric; Tiotropium; Safety
ID INHALED CORTICOSTEROIDS; ADD-ON; CHILDREN
AB Background: Black patients with asthma have a higher disease burden and greater morbidity compared with other racial/ethnic groups. Tiotropium Respimat (R), as add-on to at least inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), improves lung function and asthma control and reduces asthma exacerbation risk in patients, with a safety profile comparable with placebo. This study aimed to assess the safety of tiotropium Respimat (R), compared with placebo, in black or African-American patients.
   Methods: Data were pooled from 12 randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase II or III trials from the global Boehringer Ingelheim program with once-daily tiotropium Respimat (R) (5 mu g or 2.5 mu g). Trial participants had symptomatic persistent asthma with a broad range of severities and were aged 1-75 years. The safety results of black or African-American patients were compared with the overall trial population.
   Results: Of the 5165 patients treated with tiotropium or placebo, 3.2% were black or African American. For both doses of tiotropium, the proportion of patients reporting adverse events (AEs) was approximately 10% lower compared with placebo and was generally comparable with the proportion of patients reporting AEs in all groups of the overall population. The number of investigator-assessed drug-related AEs, AEs leading to trial drug discontinuation or serious AEs reported by patients was low and comparable between treatment groups and with the overall population.
   Conclusion: Tiotropium Respimat (R) appears to be a generally safe add-on bronchodilator treatment option to ICS with or without other controllers in pediatric and adult black or African-American patients with asthma.

TI Predicting the need for ICU admission in community-acquired pneumonia

LA English
DT Article
DE Pneumonia; ICU; Prediction; Prognosis; Infection; Cohort
ID INFECTIOUS-DISEASES-SOCIETY; IDSA/ATS MINOR CRITERIA; VALIDATION;
   GUIDELINES; SEVERITY; MANAGEMENT; ADULTS; TOOLS
AB Background: Multiple criteria have been proposed to define community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) severity and predict ICU admission. Validity studies have found differing results. We tested four models to assess severe CAP built upon the criteria included in the 2007 IDSA/ATS guidelines, hypothesizing that a model providing different weights for each individual criterion may be of better predictability.
   Methods: Retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort study of adult hospitalizations for CAP at nine hospitals in Louisville, KY from June 2014 to May 2016. Four models were tested. Model 1: original 2007 IDSA/ATS criteria. Model 2: modified IDSA/ATS criteria by removing multilobar infiltrates and changing BUN threshold to >= 30 mg/dL; adding lactate level > 2 mmol/L and requirement of non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV). CAP was severe with 1 major criterion or 3 minor criteria. Model 3: same criteria as model 2, CAP was severe with 1 major criterion or 4 minor criteria. Model 4: multiple regression analysis including the modified criteria as described in models 2 and 3 with a score assigned to each variable according to the magnitude of association between variable and need for ICU.
   Results: 8284 CAP hospitalizations were included. 1458 (18%) required ICU. Model 4 showed highest prediction of need for ICU with an area under the curve of 0.91, highest accuracy, specificity, positive predictive value, and agreement among models.
   Conclusion: Assigning differential weights to clinical predictive variables generated a score with accuracy that outperformed the original 2007 IDSA/ATS criteria for severe CAP and ICU admission.

AB This review investigates about the role of Staphylococcus Aureus (S. aureus) and S. aureus enterotoxins (SEs) in the pathogenesis of several chronic airway diseases. S. aureus is part of normal human flora and may colonize the skin and the upper airways. SEs acting as superantigens can induce an intense T cell activation and through the release of interleukin (IL) - 4, 5, and 13, can promote a polyclonal IgE response and eosinophilic inflammation. S. aureus can damage epithelial cells inducing the release of the so-called "alarmins" responsible of the activation of Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC-2) linked to an IL-5 mediated airway eosinophilic inflammation. SEs sensitization has been recently associated with the eosinophilic endotypes of both nasal polyps and late onset severe asthma. Studies investigating the effect of biological therapies in SEs sensitized patients should be performed in order to better define the role played by S. aureus in the different endotypes of severe asthma and/or chronic rhinosinusitis.

AB Background: For patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), there is limited real-world data on patient journey and treatment patterns.
   Aim: To explore predictors of early diagnosis and treatment initiation, and treatment patterns in IPF patients using linked data from Swedish registers and electronic medical records (EMRs).
   Population: A national cohort (C1) of 17,247 pulmonary fibrosis patients (ICD-10 code J84.1; no competing diagnosis) diagnosed between 2001 and 2015, and an EMR-based regional subset (C2) comprising 1755 IPF patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2017. The time from early disease symptoms to diagnosis, use of anti-fibrotic medications, time from diagnosis to initiation of anti-fibrotic treatment, and adherence, persistence and treatment length with pirfenidone were explored in these patients.
   Results: In C1, the median time to diagnosis from the first symptoms dyspnoea, cough and fatigue were 307, 563 and 639 days, respectively. Glucocorticoids were the most frequently prescribed medication. Less than 10% of patients undergoing or initiating treatment, used pirfenidone or nintedanib. Males had a higher probability of initiating anti-fibrotic treatment than females within a year of diagnosis. One-year persistence in pirfenidone patients was 42% in C1 and 25% in C2.
   Conclusion: Diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis was delayed in patients with cough and fatigue, which are early symptoms of IPF. This, and lower than expected utilisation of anti-fibrotic medications, suggests missed opportunities for early disease diagnosis and treatment. The high rate of treatment discontinuation underscores the importance of supporting and guiding patients to persist with their medications to ensure an accrual benefit of treatment.

AB Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been emerging as an imaging modality to assess interstitial lung diseases (ILD). An optimal chest MRI protocol for ILDs should include non-contrast breath-holding sequences, steady-state free-precession sequences, and contrast-enhanced sequences. One of the main MRI applications in ILDs is the differentiation between areas of active inflammation (i.e. reversible stage) and fibrosis. Alveolitis presents high signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences (WS) and early-enhancement on contrast-enhanced MR sequences, while fibrotic-predominant lesions present low signal and late-enhancement in these sequences, respectively. MRI can be useful in connective tissue diseases, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and sarcoidosis. The aim of this state-of-the-art review was to perform a state-of-the-art review on the use of MRI in ILDs, and propose the optimal MRI protocols for imaging ILDs.

AB Developmental lung anomalies represent a heterogeneous group of diverse, yet related abnormalities that involve the lung parenchyma, pulmonary vasculature or a combination of both-which usually present prenatally and in early childhood. However, a substantial number of cases go unnoticed during childhood and present either incidentally or with recurrent respiratory infections progressing into adulthood. Defective development of the tracheobronchial tree and the pulmonary vasculature are proposed to cause these developmental anomalies. Encountering these lung anomalies in adults is a diagnostic challenge given their rarity and they are often mistaken as other serious pathological conditions, resulting in unnecessary diagnostic tests and procedures. The developmental lung anomalies in adults can be broadly divided into three categories: bronchopulmonary anomalies encompassing congenital bronchial atresia, bronchogenic cysts, congenital lobar emphysema and congenital pulmonary airway malformations. Vascular anomalies include pulmonary agenesis-aplasia-hypoplasia complex, unilateral absence of the pulmonary artery, pulmonary artery sling, partial anomalous pulmonary venous return, pulmonary venous varix and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. Finally combined lung parenchymal-vascular anomalies of the lung involve hypogenetic lung (scimitar) syndrome and bronchopulmonary sequestration. This article discusses the spectrum of these developmental anomalies of the lung, their etiopathogenesis, clinical and radiographic presentations in adults and management in brief.

AB Background: /objective: There are no large, multi-centre studies of Australians with bronchiectasis. The Australian Bronchiectasis Registry (ABR) was established in 2015 to create a longitudinal research platform. We aimed to describe the baseline characteristics of adult ABR participants and assess the impact of disease severity and exacerbation phenotype on quality of life (QoL).
   Methods: The ABR is a centralised database of patients with radiologically confirmed bronchiectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis. We analysed the baseline data of adult patients (>= 18 years).
   Results: From March 2016-August 2018, 799 adults were enrolled from 14 Australian sites. Baseline data were available for 589 adults predominantly from six tertiary centres (420 female, median age 71 years (interquartile range 64-77), 14% with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection). Most patients had moderate or severe disease based on the Bronchiectasis Severity Index (BSI) (84%) and FACED (59%) composite scores. Using Global Lung function Initiative-2012 reference equations, the majority of patients (48%) had normal spirometry; only 34% had airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC < LLN). Disease severity scores (BSI and FACED) were negatively correlated with QoL-Bronchiectasis domain scores (r(s) between -0.09 and -0.58). The frequent exacerbator phenotype (>= 3 in the preceding year) was identified in 23%; this group had lower scores in all QoL-B domains (p <= 0.001) and more hospitalisations (p < 0.001) than those with < 3 exacerbations.
   Conclusions: The largest cohort of Australian adults with bronchiectasis has been described. Using contemporary criteria, most patients with bronchiectasis did not have airflow obstruction. The frequent exacerbation trait connotes poorer QoL and greater health-care utilisation.

AB Background: There is a need to quantify the potential benefits of influenza-focused interventions in reducing asthma morbidity at a population level. This study aims to estimate age-specific annual excess asthma morbidity attributable to influenza in Ontario, Canada.
   Methods: Weekly counts of hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits and outpatient physician office visits for asthma were obtained from health administrative data in Ontario from 2010 to 2015, for ages 0-14, 15-59 and 60+. Asthma morbidity was modelled as a function of influenza A and B activity using linear regression, controlling for seasonal and long-term trend, mean temperature and respiratory syncytial virus. Excess asthma morbidity attributable to influenza was calculated as the difference between full model predictions and model predictions with influenza A and B variables set to 0.
   Results: Annually, influenza was associated with the following rates of excess asthma morbidity, per 100,000 people with prevalent asthma: 12.5 hospitalizations for ages 15-59 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-23.5); 35.7 hospitalizations for ages 60+ (95% CI: 3.3-67.1); 114.1 ED visits for ages 15-59 (95% CI: 46.9-181.6); 154.6 ED visits for ages 60+ (95% CI: 86.7-223.3); and 1025.7 outpatient physician office visits for ages 60+ (95% CI: 79.0-1877.3).
   Conclusions: Influenza was associated with excess asthma hospitalizations and ED visits for ages 15-59 and 60+ and outpatient physician office visits for ages 60+. Individuals with asthma aged 15-59 and 60+ might be important targets for influenza-focused interventions, to reduce asthma morbidity at the population level.

AB Background: Smoking continues to be a major risk factor for COPD and may impact the efficacy of COPD treatments, with guidelines supporting the crucial importance for current smokers of smoking cessation. A post-hoc analysis of the FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 studies assessed the impact of smoking status on the efficacy and safety of indacaterol/glycopyrrolate (IND/GLY) 27.5/15.6 mu g twice daily versus its monocomponents or placebo in patients with COPD.
   Methods: This post-hoc analysis of pooled data from the replicate, 12-week, placebo-controlled FLIGHT1 and FLIGHT2 studies compared the efficacy and safety of IND/GLY with that of IND, GLY, and placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. Baseline data from 2038 patients were pooled and grouped by smoking status (52% were current smokers and 48% were ex-smokers). The effects of treatment on lung function, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and safety were evaluated by baseline smoking status.
   Results: Treatment with IND/GLY resulted in significant improvements in lung function measurements compared with placebo, irrespective of smoking status. Improvements in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire and transition dyspnea index were significantly greater than placebo in both current and ex-smokers, whereas changes in COPD assessment test were significant only among current smokers. Improvements in lung function and PROs were greater with IND/GLY compared with its monocomponents in current and ex-smokers. The incidences of AEs and SAEs were similar between current and ex-smokers.
   Conclusions: IND/GLY demonstrated significant improvements in lung function and PROs, independent of baseline smoking status. The safety profile of IND/GLY did not differ between current and ex-smokers.

AB Background: Mortality and hospitalization due to asthma have decreased in many European countries, but asthma symptoms still cause a lot of morbidity and costs.
   Objectives: We evaluated prevalence trends of asthma, asthma symptoms and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in adults aged 20-69 years during a 20-year period from 1996 to 2016 in the city of Helsinki, the capital of Finland.
   Methods: Three cross-sectional postal surveys were conducted in random population samples 10 years apart. In 1996, 2006 and 2016, a total of 6062 (response rate 75.9%), 2449 (61.9%) and 4026 subjects (50.3%) took part, respectively.
   Results: In all responders, the prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma was 6.6% in 1996, 10% in 2006 and 10.9% in 2016. The prevalence increased from 1996 to 2006, but stabilized from 2006 to 2016, both in men and women and in smokers and non-smokers. The prevalence of current asthma (8.5% in 2006 and 8.8% in 2016) and of asthma with rhinoconjunctivitis (7.6% in 2006 and 7.5% in 2016) remained also at the same level. Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis decreased significantly from 2006 (42.7%) to 2016 (39.0%, p=0.004). Those with physician diagnosed asthma reported significantly less symptoms in 2016 compared to 2006 and 1996, although there was no change in smoking habits or medication use. Young asthmatics (20-29 years) without rhinoconjunctivitis reported least symptoms.
   Conclusion: Previously observed increase of physician-diagnosed asthma prevalence in adults seems to be levelling off in Helsinki, and patients have fewer symptoms than 20 years ago. In addition, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis is less frequent than 10 years earlier. (247 words).

AB Aim: To describe and expand the phenotype of isolated anti-Ro-52-associated rapid progressive interstitial lung disease (RP-ILD) in Dermatomyositis(DM) in Chinese patients.
   Methods: 491 patients with PM/DM-ILD hospitalized in the China-Japan Friendship Hospital from 2000 to 2017 were screened retrospectively. All proven cases of isolated anti-Ro-52-associated RP-ILD were selected for inclusion. The clinical features in this group were recorded.
   Results: Isolated Ro-52 antibodies existed in 20 PM/DM-ILD patients. Among them 5 patients developed RP-ILD. The 5 patients had typical rashes including Gottron's sign (80%), Helitrope rash (80%) and mechanic's hands (100%), but only few patients (20%) had arthralgia and muscle weakness. All patients had elevated levels of serum ferritin and decreased counts of CD3(+) T cells. The estimated high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) patterns of the five patients showed organizing pneumonia (OP) while RP-ILD patients without Ro-52 antibodies and non-RP-ILD patients with isolated Ro-52 antibodies mainly showed non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) patterns(P < 0.05). Although one patient died of infection after one month, 80%(4/5) of patients had good response to glucocorticoid treatment and these four patients survived were all alive at the end of follow-up. The survival rate in this group was the highest than those in RP-ILD patients with other myositis specific autoantibodies though the difference had no statistically significance.
   Conclusions: A small group of patients with isolated anti-Ro-52 antibody in DM could develop RP-ILD, which mainly presented OP on HRCT. Patients with isolated anti-Ro-52 antibody associated RP-ILD responded well to therapy and had good prognosis in DM.

   PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION;
   HEART-FAILURE; BETA-AGONISTS; RISK; TOLERANCE
AB Background: Asthmatics are at increased cardiovascular disease risk, which has been linked to beta2(beta(2))-agonist use. Inhalation of beta(2)-agonists increases sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) in healthy individuals, however the systemic impact of salbutamol in asthmatics using beta(2)-agonists regularly is unknown.
   Objectives: This study compared the systemic vascular responses to a clinical dose of salbutamol (Phase I) and following an acute increase in SNA (Phase II) in asthmatics and controls.
   Methods: Fourteen controls and 14 asthmatics were recruited for Phase I. On separate days, flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and peripheral arterial stiffness (pPWV) were evaluated at baseline and following either 400 mu g inhaled salbutamol or a placebo inhaler. For Phase II, heart rate, blood pressure, vascular conductance, pPWV, and central (c)PWV were evaluated in response to a large increase in SNA brought on by cold-water hand immersion (i.e. cold-pressor test) or body-temperature water hand immersion (i.e. control) in 10 controls and 10 asthmatics.
   Results: Following salbutamol, asthmatics demonstrated reduced FMD (-3.0%, p < 0.05) and increased pPWV (+0.7 m/s, p < 0.05); however, salbutamol had no effect in controls. The cold-pressor test resulted in similar increases in blood pressure, vascular flow rates and conductance, pPWV, and cPWV in both asthmatics and controls, suggesting similar neurovascular transduction in asthmatics and controls.
   Conclusion: Inhaled Salbutamol leads to increased arterial stiffness and reduced FMD in asthmatics. As asthmatics and controls had similar vascular responses to an increase in SNA, these findings suggest asthmatics have heightened sympathetic responses to beta(2)-agonists which may contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk in asthma.

AB Background: Differences in previous exacerbation history may influence prognosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We hypothesized that prognosis differs between individuals with a history of only medically treated exacerbations (moderate exacerbations) and those with a history of hospitalised exacerbations (severe exacerbations).
   Methods: We included 98 614 adults from the Copenhagen General Population Study and assessed risk of moderate and severe exacerbations, pneumonia hospitalisation, and respiratory and all-cause mortality from 2003 until 2013 according to exacerbation history.
   Results: Among 6545 individuals with COPD, 6290 had no exacerbations in the preceding year, 109 had one moderate exacerbation, 108 had two or more moderate exacerbations, and 38 had one or more severe exacerbations. During 9.4 years of follow-up, we observed 926 moderate and 244 severe exacerbations, 477 pneumonias, and 707 deaths, including 69 from respiratory disease. Compared to individuals without previous exacerbations, lung function and symptom adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for future moderate exacerbation were 4.68 (95% confidence interval: 3.31-6.62) for individuals with one previous moderate exacerbation, 21 (13-33) for individuals with two or more previous moderate exacerbations, and 5.30 (3.44-8.15) for individuals with one or more previous severe exacerbations. Corresponding HRs were 1.62(0.78-3.34), 1.29(0.57-2.89), and 5.43 (2.56-12) for severe exacerbation, 1.86(1.06-3.27), 1.74(1.01-2.99), and 4.85 (2.94-8.02) for pneumonia, 0.53(0.10-2.99), 1.65(0.53-5.17), and 2.98 (1.14-7.83) for respiratory mortality, and 1.34(0.79-2.29), 1.57(1.00-2.47), and 1.49 (0.85-2.62) for all-cause mortality, respectively.
   Conclusion: Individuals with COPD and a history of hospitalised exacerbations carried the poorest prognosis compared to those with a history of only medically treated exacerbations, suggesting difference in risk profile.

AB Non-collagenous proteins such as osteocalcin function as regulators of the mineralization process in bone. Osteocalcin undergoes post-translational modification adding an extra carboxylate group on three of its glutamate residues to enhance interaction with bone mineral. In this work, we examine regulation of biomimetic apatite formation by osteocalcin that was not modified after translation. We analyze the structural features in the protein and mineral-protein interfaces to elicit the unmodified protein's fold inside the mineral and to unveil the species that interact with the mineral surface. The results presented here give clues on the protein's active role in controlling the mineral phases that are formed on hydroxyapatite crystals and its ability to influence the extent of order in these crystals.

AB A single biomineralization of demineralized dentin is significant to restore the demineralized dentin due to dental caries or erosion. In recent years, meaningful progress has been made regarding the mechanisms involved in the biomineralization of dentin collagen. Concepts changing from the classical ion-based crystallization to non-classical particle-based crystallization, inspired a different strategy to infiltrate the demineralized dentin collagen. The remarkable discovery was the report of liquid-like amorphous calcium phosphate as nanoprecursor particles to carbonated hydroxyapatite. The non-collagenous proteins and their analogues are widely investigated, for their key role in controlling mineralization during the process of crystal nucleation and growth. The in-depth studies of the gap zone provided significant improvements in our understanding of the structure of collagen and of the intrafibrillar remineralization of collagen fibrils. The collagen is not a passive substrate as previously supposed, and the active role of guiding nanoprecursor infiltration and mediating its nucleation has been demonstrated. Furthermore, recovery of mechanical properties has been evaluated to determine the effectiveness of dentin remineralization. Finally, the problems regarding the origin formation of the calcium phosphate that is deposited in the collagen, and the exact interactions between the non-collagenous proteins, amorphous calcium phosphate and collagen are still unclear. We reviewed the importance of these findings in enriching our understanding of dentin biomineralization, while addressing certain limitations that are inherent to in vitro studies.

AB Nucleotide import is critical to the reverse transcription and thus a key step in the life cycle of HIV-1 virus. In this work, boosted by the recently determined atomic structure of the whole HIV-1 capsid and our understanding of its dynamics, we carry out a computational structure-based study of the mechanism of nucleotide import by HIV-1 capsid. Our analysis reveals a number of novel insights into the mechanism. Specifically, our structure analysis indicates that arginine 18 side chains use a bind-translocate-release mechanism to bind and guide the long nucleotide to pass through the arginine ring before releasing it into the capsid. We discover that LYS 25 plays a critical role in defining the directionality of the transport, in facilitating the disassociation of nucleotides from the arginine ring, and in relaying them further into the interior of the capsid. We predict that mutations of LYS 25 to other residues, assuming that they still result in viable viruses, should reverse the directionality of the transport and significantly lower the infectivity.

AB To understand mineral transport pathways for shell secretion and to assess differences in cellular activity during mineralization, we imaged with TEM and FE-SEM ultrastructural characteristics of outer mantle epithelium (OME) cells. Imaging was carried out on Magellania venosa shells embedded/etched, chemically fixed/decalcified and high-pressure frozen/freeze-substituted samples from the commissure, central shell portions and from puncta. Imaging results are complemented with morphometric evaluations of volume fractions of membrane-bound organelles.
   At the commissure the OME consists of several layers of cells. These cells form oblique extensions that, in cross-section, are round below the primary layer and flat underneath fibres. At the commissure the OME is multi-cell layered, in central shell regions it is single-cell layered. When actively secreting shell carbonate extrapallial space is lacking, because OME cells are in direct contact with the calcite of the forming fibres. Upon termination of secretion, OME cells attach via apical hemidesmosomes to extracellular matrix membranes that line the proximal surface of fibres. At the commissure volume fractions for vesicles, mitochondria and lysosomes are higher relative to single-cell layered regions, whereas for endoplasmic-reticulum and Golgi apparatus there is no difference.
   FE-SEM, TEM imaging reveals the lack of extrapallial space between OME cells and developing fibres. In addition, there is no indication for an amorphous precursor within fibres when these are in active secretion mode. Accordingly, our results do not support transport of minerals by vesicles from cells to sites of mineralization, rather by transfer of carbonate ions via transport mechanisms associated with OME cell membranes.

AB Staphylococcus aureus is an important cause of resistant healthcare-associated infections. It has been shown that the wall teichoic acid (WTA) may be an important drug target acting on antibiotic-resistant cells. The UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase, MnaA, is one of the first enzymes on the pathway for the biosynthesis of the WTA. Here, detailed molecular dynamics simulations of S. aureus MnaA were used to characterize the conformational changes that occur in the presence of UDP and UDP-GlcNac and also the energetic landscape associated with these changes. Using different simulation techniques, such as ABMD and GAMD, it was possible to assess the energetic profile for the protein with and without ligands in its active site. We found that there is a dynamic energy landscape that has its minimum changed by the presence of the ligands, with a closed structure of the enzyme being more frequently observed for the bound state while the unbound enzyme favors an opened conformation. Further structural analysis indicated that positively charged amino acids associated with UDP and UDP-GlcNac interactions play a major role in the enzyme opening movement. Finally, the energy landscape profiled in this work provides important conclusions for the design of inhibitor candidates targeting S. aureus MnaA.

AB The introduction of ligand-binding sites into proteins and the engineering of molecular allosteric coupling pathways are topical issues in protein design. Here, we show that these issues can be addressed concurrently, using the serpin human alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) as a model. We have introduced up to 15 amino acid substitutions into ACT, converting it into a surrogate corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), thereby creating a new binding globulin (NewBG). Human CBG and ACT share 46% sequence identity, and CBG served as the blueprint for our design, which was guided by side-chain-packing calculations, ITC measurements and crystal structure determinations. Upon transfer of ligand-interacting residues from CBG to ACT and mutation of specific second shell residues, a NewBG variant was obtained, which binds cortisol with 1.5 mu M affinity. This novel serpin (NewBG-III) binds cortisol with a 33-fold lower affinity than CBG, but shares a similar ligand-binding profile and binding mode when probed with different steroid ligands and site-directed mutagenesis. An additional substitution, i.e. A349R, created NewBG-III-allo, which introduced an allosteric coupling between ligand binding and the serpin-like S-to-R transition in ACT. In NewBG-III-allo, the proteinase-triggered S-to-R transition leads to a greater than 200-fold reduction in ligand affinity, and crystal structures suggest that this is mediated by the L55V and A349R substitutions. This reduction significantly exceeds the 10-fold reduction in binding affinity observed in human CBG.

AB Analyses of the hydropathic environments of protein amino acid residues reveal structural information on multiple levels. The interactions made by each residue are the basis for sidechain (rotamer) conformation and ultimately for secondary, tertiary and even quaternary protein structure. By identifying and characterizing the interactions for each residue type, we are developing a basis set of environmental data that can be used to understand protein structure. This work focuses alanine and its roles. We calculated and analyzed separately backbone-to-environment and sidechain-to-environment 3D maps for over 57,000 alanines that, with respect to hydrophobic and polar interactions, show the environment around each. After binning by backbone phi and psi angles, we clustered each bin with k-means based on calculated map similarities between map-map pairs. Four bins were examined in detail: one in the beta-pleat region, two in the right-hand alpha-helix (RH alpha) region and one in the left-hand alpha-helix region of the Ramachandran plot. All regions indicated a common map motif of hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions along the CA-CB axis, accounting for 62% in the beta-pleat bin, about one-third in the two RH alpha bins and 42% in the LH alpha bin. Another shared motif shows no interactions along the CA-CB axis; this was uncommon (8%) in beta-pleat, but > 30% elsewhere. The maps calculated for the two RH alpha bins are extremely similar (pairwise > 0.9787), which suggests that the hydropathic interaction sets or motifs found around each residue are conserved. Altogether, these results are integral to a new paradigm for understanding protein structure and function.

AB In contrast to other prokaryotes, the Mycobacterial F1FO ATP synthase (alpha(3):beta(3):gamma:delta:epsilon:a:b:b':c(9)) is essential for growth. The mycobacterial enzyme is also unique as a result of its 111 amino acids extended delta subunit, whose gene is fused to the peripheral stalk subunit b. Recently, the crystallographic structures of the mycobacterial a alpha(3):beta(3):gamma:epsilon-domain and c subunit ring were resolved. Here, we report the first purification protocol of the intact M. smegmatis F1FO ATP synthase including the F-1-domain, the entire membrane-embedded F-O sector, and the stator subunits b' and the fused b-delta. This enzyme purification enabled the determination of the first projected 2D- and 3D structure of the intact M. smegmatis F1FO ATP synthase by electron microscopy (EM) and single particle analysis. Expression and purification of the fused mycobacterial b-delta(24-446) construct, excluding the membrane-embedded N-terminal amino acids, provided insight into its secondary structure. By combining these data with homology and ab-initio modeling techniques, a model of the mycobacterial peripheral stalk subunits b-delta and b' was generated. Superposition of the 3D M. smegmatis F-ATP synthase EM-structure, the alpha(3):beta(3):gamma:epsilon and c-ring, and the derived structural models of the peripheral stalk enabled a clear assignment of all F-ATP synthase subunits, in particular with respect to the unique mycobacterial peripheral stalk subunit b' and the elongated delta fused with subunit b. The arrangement of delta relative to the N-termini of the catalytic alpha(3)beta(3)-headpiece and its potential as a drug target are discussed.

AB ArsR As(III)-responsive transcriptional repressors, members of the ArsR/SmtB family of metalloregulatory proteins, have been characterized biochemically but, to date, no As(III)-bound structure has been solved. Here we report two crystal structures of ArsR repressors from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (AfArsR) and Corynebacterium glutamicum (CgArsR) in the As(III)-bound form. AfArsR crystallized in P2(1) space group and diffracted up to 1.86 angstrom. CgArsR crystallized in P2(1)2(1)2(1) and diffracted up to 1.6 angstrom. AfArsR showed one As(III) bound in one subunit of the homodimer, while the CgArsR structure showed two As(III) bound with S-3 coordination, one in each monomer. Previous studies indicated that in AfArsR As(III) binds to Cys95, Cys96 and Cys102 from the same monomer, while, in CgArsR, to Cys15, Cys16 from one monomer and Cys55 from the other monomer. The dimer interfaces of these structures showed distinct differences from other members of the ArsR/SmtB family of proteins, which potentially renders multiple options for evolving metal(loid) binding sites in this family of proteins. Also, CgArsR presents a new alpha 2-N binding site, not the previously predicted alpha 3-N site. Despite differences in the location of the binding cysteines in the primary sequences of these proteins, the two metal binding sites are almost congruent on their structures, an example of convergent evolution. Analyses of the electrostatic surface of the proteins at the DNA binding domain indicate that there two different modes of derepression in the ArsR/SmtB family of metalloregulatory proteins.

AB The saturated hydrocarbon bisabolane is a diesel fuel substitute that can be derived from sesquiterpene precursors bisabolene or curcumene. These sesquiterpenes are generated from farnesyl diphosphate in reactions catalyzed by eponymous terpenoid cyclases, but they can also be generated by engineered terpenoid cyclases in which cyclization cascades have been reprogrammed by mutagenesis. Here, we describe the X-ray crystal structure determination of F95Q epi-isozizaene synthase (EIZS), in which the new activity of curcumene biosynthesis has been introduced and the native activity of epi-isozizaene biosynthesis has been suppressed. F95Q EIZS generates beta- and gamma-curcumene regioisomers with greater than 50% yield. Structural analysis of the closed active site conformation, stabilized by the binding of 3 Mg2+ ions, inorganic pyrophosphate, and the benzyl-triethylammonium cation, reveals a product-like active site contour that serves as the cyclization template. Remolding the active site contour to resemble curcumene instead of epi-isozizaene is the principal determinant of the reprogrammed cyclization cascade. Intriguingly, an ordered water molecule comprises part of the active site contour. This water molecule may also serve as a final proton acceptor, along with inorganic pyrophosphate, in the generation of curcumene regioisomers; it may also contribute to the formation of sesquiterpene alcohols identified as minor side products. Thus, the substitution of polar side chains for nonpolar side chains in terpenoid cyclase active sites can result in the stabilization of bound water molecules that, in turn, can serve template functions in isoprenoid cyclization reactions.

AB The combinatorial dimerization of the ErbB growth factor receptors (ErbB(1) - ErbB(4)) are critical for their function. Here, we have characterized the conformational dynamics of ErbB transmembrane homo-dimers and hetero-dimers by using a coarse-grain simulation framework. All dimers, except ErbB (4-4) and ErbB(1-4), exhibit at least two conformations. The reported NMR structures correspond to one of these conformations, representing the N-terminal active state in ErbB(1-1) (RH2), ErbB(2-2) (RH1) and ErbB(4-4) (RH) homo-dimers and the LH dimer in ErbB(3-3) homo-dimer, validating the computational approach. Further, we predict a right-handed ErbB(4) dimer conformer that warrants experimental testing. The five hetero-dimers that have not yet been experimentally resolved display prominent right-handed dimers associating by the SmXXXSm motif. Our results provide insights into the constitutive signaling of ErbB(4) after cleavage of the extracellular region. The presence of the inactive-like dimer conformers leading to symmetric kinase domains gives clues on the autoinhibition of the receptor dimers. The dimer states characterized here represent an important step towards understanding the combinatorial cross associations in the ErbB family.

AB BACKGROUND: Melorheostosis is a bone hyperostosis disorder characterized flowing bone thought to occur in a sclerodermal distribution. These bony lesions often arise in soft tissues adjacent to joints. Pain arises from joint limitations and impingements, but diffuse pain can also occur.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a patient with symptomatic compression of the common peroneal nerve by an extraosseous hyperostotic tissue island in a patient with melorheostosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Melorheostosis is a rare bone overgrowth syndrome that can to joint mobility limitations and pain. In specific locations, it can also lead to tethering and symptomatic compression of the peripheral nerves.

ID WINGLESS SIGNALING PATHWAY; CATENIN GENE CTNNB1; AGGRESSIVE

AB BACKGROUND: Desmoid tumors are known to be rare and relatively slow growing with locally invasive histology and high recurrence rates. A rare subset of these tumors occurs adjacent to the spinal column after surgery. Since 1961, only 6 cases of postoperative paraspinal desmoid tumor have been reported. This report is the first to describe the occurrence of a paraspinal desmoid tumor after surgical correction of a spinal deformity.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old woman with multiple sclerosis reported 2-3 years of progressively worsening mid and low back pain that was worse with standing and ambulation and almost completely relieved with lying flat. Standing anteroposterior scoliosis radiographs revealed a thoracolumbar spinal deformity, which was surgically corrected with a T4 pelvis spinal fixation and fusion. At her 2-year postoperative clinic visit the patient reported good improvement in her preoperative symptoms but felt a fullness in her right upper back and neck that was nontender. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large tumor in this region. The tumor was resected en bloc, and pathology noted a 14.5 cm x 8.7 cm x 4.2 cm mass with spindle cell proliferation and positive staining for beta-catenin (mutated gene found in 85% of desmoid tumors).
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a postoperative desmoid tumor after spinal deformity correction and the seventh reported case in the spine literature. All reported cases have been women aged 39-57 years. The patient will be followed closely with magnetic resonance imaging given the known high local recurrence rate of this tumor.

DT Article
DE Aneurysm clip; Narrow working space; Suture thread; Vascular injury
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial vascular injury incurred during surgery must be repaired as quickly as possible. The standard repair procedure is surgical suturing. However, the narrow and deep working space may obstruct creating a knot with the suture thread.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Resection of an olfactory groove meningioma was performed in a 73-year-old woman via the right lateral supraorbital approach. Tumor retraction caused an injury to the pericallosal artery. After temporary clipping of the vessel, a 10-0 nylon thread was placed on the vascular lesion and the end of the thread was fixed with an aneurysm clip.
   CONCLUSIONS: Fixing the suture thread with an aneurysm clip can be a rescue technique in suturing procedures on deeply located vascular lesions.

AB BACKGROUND: An epidermoid cyst arising from diploic space in the skull can cause an intracranial mass effect with compression of the underlying venous sinuses.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 66-year-old woman came to us with a persistent headache and unsteadiness. Computed tomography demonstrated an occipital bone cystic lesion with an intracranial mass effect overlying the torcular herophili, with high-intensity findings in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebral angiogram demonstrated obstruction of the torcular herophili with development of diploic venous drainage. The patient underwent removal of the lesion and a cranioplasty procedure. The diagnosis was torcular epidermoid cyst. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the symptoms were resolved.
   CONCLUSIONS: Development of diploic venous drainage contributed to avoidance of critical intracranial hypertension during slow growth of a torcular epidermoid cyst.

AB BACKGROUND: Central nervous system (CNS) relapse is an uncommon complication of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. It is becoming a more prevalent pathologic entity in the rituximab era. Our case provides insight into the pathophysiology, diagnosis, prevention, and management of secondary intraventricular CNS lymphomas.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report an unusual case of a 64-year-old man who presented with an isolated secondary CNS lymphoma involving the choroid plexus in a diffuse pattern. He initially presented with obstructive hydrocephalus from diffuse choroid plexus lesions and was commenced on systemic therapy after confirmation of diagnosis via samples obtained from an open biopsy.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the lack of high-quality evidence behind the use of high-dose intravenous methotrexate as CNS prophylaxis. The case provides additional insight into the pathophysiology of intraventricular CNS lymphomas and the importance of establishing a histopathologic diagnosis via an open biopsy before the administration of high-dose steroids.

ID SINUS; REVASCULARIZATION; RUPTURE
AB BACKGROUND: Epistaxis is a rare presentation of the ruptured cavernous carotid aneurysm, especially the nontraumatic type. Both endovascular therapies and open surgeries have a role in the treatment with various outcomes, but the standard procedure is not well established. We report a successful high-flow bypass with cervical internal carotid artery ligation for aneurysm repair and review the related literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 81-year-old man presented with massive epistaxis from the left nostril. The epistaxis was controlled by nasal packing. A saccular aneurysm of the cavernous segment of the left internal carotid artery projecting into the sphenoid sinus was revealed using computed tomography angiography. We treated this patient with high-flow bypass with ligation of the cervical internal carotid artery. Immediate postoperative computed tomography angiography showed complete disappearance of the aneurysm. Nasal packing was removed without further bleeding. No neurological deficit or complications were detected in the postoperative period.
   CONCLUSIONS: In cases of massive or recurrent epistaxis without coagulopathy or nasal pathology, a cavernous carotid aneurysm should be considered. Immediate cessation of the bleeding is necessary. Flow-preservation bypass with proximal ligation of the parent artery is 1 of the effective procedures for the treatment of this condition with low morbidity.

AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral vasospasm causing delayed cerebral ischemia after transsphenoidal surgery is a rare but life-threatening complication. Reports in the literature after extended endoscopic endonasal approach (EEEA) are scarce. Considering the progressive use of this technique during recent years, a better understanding of the potential adverse effects after this procedure is needed. The aim of this report was to systematically analyze the current literature and discuss management and causes for cerebral vasospasm after EEEA surgery.
   METHODS: We performed a systematic search of the literature according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement and aimed to discuss relevant risk factors for cerebral vasospasm after extended transsphenoidal surgery.
   RESULTS: Thirty-four cases of delayed cerebral vasospasm after transsphenoidal surgery were identified. Among these, 4 were operated with an EEEA. We provide an extensive literature review and discuss causes and management of this delayed complication. We further present the case of a young woman who underwent resection for a large suprasellar recurrent pituitary adenoma. Surgery and initial postoperative course were uneventful. On the eighth postoperative day, the patient developed aphasia and brachiofacial paresis. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) demonstrated cerebral vasospasm, and repeated intra-arterial nimodipine infusion was administrated. The patient recovered completely and was discharged without neurologic deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: The threshold for DSA after unexplained neurologic deterioration after extended transsphenoidal surgery should be low, and cerebral vasospasm should be treated early and aggressively. Surgeons performing EEEA need to consider the possibility of this delayed complication.

AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial meningiomas are brain tumors that have probably been known the longest, largely because of the occasional production of grotesque cranial deformities that have attracted the attention and interest of humankind. Because of the tendency of some intracranial meningiomas to cause skull deformation and thickening, these tumors have given rise to various speculations and theories related to their origin, starting in prehistoric times up to the present.
   METHODS: From the Steinheim skull and "pharaonic meningiomas" to the first meningioma monograph and the first explanations of Harvey Cushing regarding the mechanism of hyperostosis, this review aims to weave again the story of Arachne. We identify the main contributors who have tried to understand and explain the tendency of some of these tumors to cause hyperostosis or other skull bone involvements.
   CONCLUSIONS: The contribution of neurosurgeons or pathologists over the centuries is of undeniable importance and is the basis for understanding future molecular mechanisms.

ID REGIONAL PAIN SYNDROME; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; COMPLICATIONS; OUTCOMES;
   NERVE
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal cord stimulation has been shown to be an effective for some patients diagnosed with chronic pain and failed back syndrome. However, lead migration from the implantation site is a potential complication that may reduce treatment efficacy, produce unintended symptoms, and require invasive and costly surgical replacement or removal.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 71-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with diffuse headache and burning left-sided facial pain consistent with trigeminal neuralgia. She had a history of chronic regional pain syndrome that had been successfully treated for 8 years with a percutaneous spinal cord stimulator, and 2 weeks before presentation she had had the cervical lead replaced. Computed tomography demonstrated intradural and intracranial migration of the cervical lead, which had traversed along the left lateral aspect of the medulla and terminated at the pontomedullary junction The migrated cervical lead was removed surgically. At follow-up, her trigeminal pain had resolved.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although spinal cord stimulation has demonstrated effectiveness as a treatment for chronic pain, care must be taken to ensure that the spinal cord stimulator leads are properly placed within the epidural space and are firmly anchored to avoid migration. Intracranial migration of a spinal cord stimulator lead poses significant risks for injury to adjacent cortical structures and may produce pain syndromes including trigeminal neuralgia.

AB BACKGROUND: Formation of a dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) after lumbar spine decompression in the lumbar spine has been reported as a late complication, but is extremely rare in the cervical spine.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 57-year-old man who underwent a C5-6, C6-7 anterior fusion 5 years previously for cervical myelopathy at another hospital presented with progressive gait disturbance and thermal hypoalgesia on the right side of the body. Magnetic resonance imaging showed flow voids in the spinal cord dorsally at the C4-7 level, which had not been detected before the initial operation. Digital subtraction angiography showed a fistulous connection at the C7 level between the perimedullary vein and a segmental artery from the right vertebral artery, which was diagnosed as a DAVF. Surgical interruption of the intradural draining vein with multilevel posterior cervical decompression was performed, and his symptoms improved.
   CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a DAVF developing atter multilevel anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. All the published cases of secondary DAVF, especially after spinal surgery, are reviewed.

TI Computed Tomography-Guided Posterolateral Transsacral Ala Approach to
   Presacral L5 Schwannoma: Technical Note
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring; Minimally invasive;
   Posterolateral approach; Presacral schwannoma; Spinal navigation
AB BACKGROUND: Presacral schwannomas are rare tumors that may reach large size before becoming symptomatic. Total surgical removal has been considered the best treatment option Tumors arising from the presacral area are commonly managed through anterior approaches, whereas posterior approaches are used for pure intrasacral tumors or large lesions with both intrasacral and presacral extension, alone or in combination with anterior approaches.
   METHODS: We describe a quick and minimally invasive navigation-guided posterolateral approach to a right presacral L5 schwannoma. The lesion was microsurgically removed through high-speed drilling of the upper portion of the right sacral ala, under intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring.
   RESULTS: The postoperative course was unremarkable, and the patient experienced improvement in his sensory disturbance. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scan showed the complete excision of the lesion and the removal of the upper sacral ala with preservation of the right L5-S1 articular complex. The histologic examination confirmed a schwannoma (World Health Organization grade I).
   CONCLUSIONS: The posterolateral transsacral ala approach may represent a minimally invasive option in the surgical management of presacral well-circumscribed benign tumors. Spinal navigation could be properly used to facilitate lesion exposure and to minimize the bone removal, The intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring is an essential tool for the preservation of the lumbosacral nerve roots.

LA English
DT Review
DE Blood loss; Complications; Direct surgery; Meningioma; Preoperative
   embolization; Surgical time
ID POLYVINYL-ALCOHOL PARTICLES; EFFICACY; COMPLICATIONS; SAFETY; RESECTION
AB BACKGROUND: Preoperative embolization (POE) of meningioma has been established to facilitate surgical resection, which may reduce intraoperative blood loss and surgical time. However, no consensus has been achieved in meningioma treatment and no meta-analysis has been conducted. The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis and provide evidence of the efficacy of meningioma treatment with POE and direct surgery.
   METHODS: This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. A systematic search was performed using PubMed and EMBASE. Meta-analysis was performed using the risk ratio of overall complication, mean difference (MD) of blood loss, and surgical time. The I-2 statistic was used to assess the heterogeneity.
   RESULTS: Eight studies (1 randomized controlled trial and 7 non-randomized controlled trials) were included, in which 510 patients met the inclusion criteria. We found that preoperative embolization for patients with meningioma did not increase the overall complication rate (risk ratio = 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-1.38) and can significantly reduce intraoperative blood loss (MD = -65.10, 95% CI -124.76 to -20.82) and surgical time (MD = -38.48, 95% CI -64.03 to -12.93) compared with the control patients. No significant publication bias was observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis supports the hypothesis that POE of meningioma is a useful adjunct in meningioma treatment. This technique helps reduce blood loss and surgical time during meningioma resection.

TI Resolution of Symptomatic Lumbar Synovial Cyst After Traumatic Event
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Facet cyst; Lumbar; Radiculopathy; Resolution; Spine; Synovial cyst;
   Traumatic
ID DIAGNOSIS; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Synovial cysts are most commonly found in the lumbar spine and are associated with low back pain and radiculopathy. Frequent use of imaging modalities has led to an increase in intraspinal synovial cyst identification. Treatment typically ranges from conservative measures to surgical decompression, but spontaneous resolution has previously been reported. Here, we present the first report of symptomatic lumbar synovial cyst resolution after a traumatic fall.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a symptomatic synovial cyst between the fourth (L4) and fifth (L5) lumbar vertebrae identified on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patient presented with right paramedian back pain and right-sided L5 radiculopathy. She underwent unsuccessful trials of antiinflammatory agents and physical therapy. Less than 1 year since initial diagnosis, the patient sustained a mechanic fall followed by resolution of prior symptoms. A subsequent lumbar MRI revealed complete resolution of the intraspinal synovial cyst.
   CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of synovial cysts are increasing in frequency due to their ease of identification with computed tomography and MRI. For cases of refractory pain and/or neurologic deficits, surgical decompression is usually necessary. In rare instances, synovial cysts may spontaneously regress or resolve secondary to other events. This is the first description of resolution after a traumatic fall. Due to limited data on this topic, this report may provide additional insight into the pathophysiology of synovial cyst formation and resolution.

DT Article
DE Brain injury; Retractorless surgery; Vestibular schwannoma
ID SURGICAL REMOVAL; BRAIN RETRACTION; BLOOD-FLOW
AB BACKGROUND: A fixed retractor is routinely used during surgery for vestibular schwannoma to maintain the surgical corridor; however, brain injuries can be caused by use of retractors. The aim of this study was to present strategies for retractorless surgery for giant vestibular schwannomas and compare retractorless surgery with traditional retractor-assisted surgery to illustrate feasibility and potentially superiority of retractorless surgery.
   METHODS: Clinical data of 61 patients with giant (>= 4 cm diameter) vestibular schwannomas undergoing craniotomy were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into 2 cohorts: 1) 35 patients with traditional retractor surgery performed between June 2016 and July 2017; 2) 26 patients with retractorless surgery performed between June 2016 and July 2018. Duration of operation, intraoperative blood loss, extent of resection, rate of retention of facial nerve function, postoperative brain injury rate, intracranial infection rate, hospitalization time, and grade of facial nerve function were compared between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative brain injury Was 3.84% in the retractorless surgery group, which was significantly lower compared with the traditional retractor surgery group (22.86%) (P< 0.05). No significant differences were found regarding the other characteristics compared.
   CONCLUSIONS: Through appropriate comprehensive measures, retractorless surgery for giant vestibular schwannomas is an achievable goal. This procedure can reduce the incidence of postoperative brain injury with satisfactory tumor resection.

DT Review
DE Bilateral lambdoid; Craniosynostosis; Mercedes-Benz syndrome;

ID CRANIOFACIAL DYSSYNOSTOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Bilateral lambdoid and posterior sagittal synostosis is a rarely encountered multisutural craniosynostosis accounting for 0.3%-0.7% of all craniosynostoses. It has been named "Mercedes- Benz Syndrome" (MBS) because of the bone ridges that resemble the Mercedes-Benz logo. The typical head shape is usually described as anterior turricephaly combined with mild brachycephaly. We describe a case of pure MBS without involvement of other sutures. Since we believe that MBS is a different pathology when other sutures are involved, we will discuss our case with a review of the literature, including all reported cases of bilateral lambdoid and posterior sagittal synostosis with no other sutures involved but sagittal and bilateral lambdoid.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 3-month-old female baby came to our attention because of a turrycephalic appearance of the head. Findings of the neurologic examination were unremarkable. Computed tomography scan showed premature fusion of posterior third of sagittal suture and bilateral lambdoid suture. Magnetic resonance imaging did not show relevant intracranial abnormalities. She underwent sagittal decompression extended posteriorly below the lambdoid suture combined with biparietal decompression to obtain expansion of both parieto-frontal bones and posterior fossa. Post-operative course was uneventful. Follow-up at 3 months showed a good aesthetic result, and results of the neurologic examination were unremarkable.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pure MBS is a rare condition that unlike other multisutural complex craniosynostosis is rarely associated with genetic syndromes, has a low rate of associated intracranial anomalies, and has less need for more skull-remodeling surgery. The choice of the most suitable surgical procedure must be tailored on the patient, considering preoperative head appearance and eventually associated anomalies.

AB BACKGROUND: Postoperative hemorrhage is a serious complication of intracranial surgery. Epidural hematomas (EDHs) are one of the common forms of bleeding after surgery, with <= 12% of patients requiring re-exploration. However, distant or remote site EDHs have been rare, in particular, those in a supratentorial location after infratentorial surgery.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report an unusual complication of surgery for fourth ventricular outlet obstruction. A young male patient developed multiple sequential supratentorial EDHs after posterior fossa surgery. He required 2 re-explorations after the primary surgery for evacuation of the EDHs within 24 hours. In the available data, we found only 28 such reported cases previously. Only 2 additional cases have been reported to have sequential EDHs after surgery. Various theories have been postulated, ranging from sudden intracranial pressure decompression, pin site hematoma, and shunt site bleeding due to dural stripping. None has been proven to definitively explain the complication.
   CONCLUSIONS: We wished to highlight this unusual complication of posterior fossa surgery, with an emphasis on rapid computed tomography scanning of the brain for patients in the early postoperative period with any neurological deterioration. Early radiological detection and timely intervention can be lifesaving.

ID TRANSVENOUS EMBOLIZATION
AB Background: A case of high-flow cervical vertebro-vertebral arteriovenous fistula (VVAVF), which was occluded with detachable coils by the transarterial/transvenous double-catheter technique and balloon anchoring technique, is reported.
   Case Description: A 32-year-old male who had a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and arrhythmia under anticoagulation presented with a neck bruit after a right internal jugular vein puncture. A high-flow VVAVF between the right vertebral artery (VA) and vertebral vein (VV) was revealed by ultrasonography and angiography. To extirpate the shunt while preserving the right VA without using a stent to avoid antiplatelet therapy, the double-catheter technique was used to occlude the vein and shunt tightly, 1 catheter from the venous side and the other from the VA to the VV through the shunt. Finally, stabilization of the coil cage in the dilating VV was secured by placing a balloon distally as an anchor and successfully occluding the shunt with small amounts of coils only on the venous side. The shunt and cervical bruit disappeared immediately after the treatment, and no recurrence was observed.
   Conclusions: The double-catheter technique and balloon anchoring technique used in this case seem effective for transvenous embolization of VVAVF when preservation of the VA is desired.

DE Aneurysm; External carotid artery; Stent
ID ANEURYSM
AB BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pseudoaneurysms of the external carotid artery (ECA) between the internal maxillary artery and the facial artery are rare. Endovascular covered stenting is an alternative method for surgically challenging cases; however, movable and flexible vessels may prevent the maintenance of the stent.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 26-year-old woman presented with sudden swelling and pain of the left chin due to a pseudoaneurysm of the proximal ECA trunk. She had undergone endovascular covered stenting and suddenly developed facial palsy at postprocedural 1 week. Regrowth of the aneurysm and slippage of the stent were detected, and additional stenting was performed. Swelling and pain of the chin and neck and subsequently the facial palsy completely resolved, and the patient made a full recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS: The ECA aneurysm between the internal maxillary artery and facial artery may be more floating and changeable than any other portions of the ECA, and regrowth of the ECA aneurysm may cause delayed complication. In addition, knowledge of the mechanism is necessary to help in the endovascular treatment.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the technical details of 3-piece orbitozygomatic (OZ) craniotomy using a diamond thread-wire saw as an alternative to cutting the orbital rim and zygoma.
   METHODS: The details of this procedure are presented cadaver dissection and a surgical case.
   RESULTS: Three-piece OZ craniotomy consists of 3 steps of bone flap elevation. First, the zygomatic arch is divided and reflected downward with the temporal muscle. This provides adequate exposure around the inferior orbital fissure with less skin flap retraction. In the second step, frontotemporal craniotomy is performed close to the skull base without the requirement for additional craniectomy. Finally, the superolateral wall of the orbital bone flap is elevated. Cutting the orbital rim and zygoma with a diamond threadwire saw allows reconstruction with a minimal bone gap.
   CONCLUSIONS: The herein-described 3-piece OZ craniotomy technique is simple and provides excellent brain exposure equivalent to that achieved by 1- and 2-piece OZ craniotomy while minimizing flap retraction and requiring less additional bone removal.

AB BACKGROUND: Lumbar radicular pain is one of the most commonly encountered clinical syndromes; however, its underlying mechanistic basis, and its relation to the natural history of the disease, are poorly understood.
   METHODS: We revieved the available literature to explore the pathophysiology and natural history of lumbar radicular pain.
   RESULTS: Experimental observations have spawned distinctive, but not wally exclusive, pathophysiologic descriptions of radicular pain. These mechanisms include mechanical compression and inflammatory processes. In most cases, a complex interplay between these mechanisms is required to sustain the pain. However, when the dorsal root ganglion is mechanically deformed, sustained discharges causing pain can be evoked, leading to pain based on a purely mechanical basis. However, in other instances, previous sensitization of the nerve root by inflammatory processes is required.
   CONCLUSION: An understanding of these processes and the natural history of syndrome is important to developing therapeutic strategies.

   primitive trigeminal artery
ID TRANSVENOUS EMBOLIZATION; BALLOON
AB BACKGROUND: A spontaneous persistent primitive trigeminal artery-cavernous sinus fistula (PCF) is extremely rare. Until recently, endovascular treatment for PCF involving transarterial and/or transvenous coil embolization of the cavernous sinus (with/without the persistent trigeminal artery) was commonly performed. However, it may result in remaining shunt flow or exacerbation of cranial nerve palsy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 51-year-old woman presented with headache and left abducens palsy. Digital subtraction angiography demonstrated a direct fistula between the cavernous segment of the persistent primitive trigeminal artery (PPTA) and posterosuperior compartment of the left cavernous sinus (CS). Three microcatheters were guided into the fistula as follows: 1) through the PPTA to the CS from the left internal carotid artery, 2) through the PPTA to the CS from the basilar artery, and 3) through the CS to the PPTA from the internal jugular vein. Using the double-catheter technique in a multidirectional fashion, shunt occlusion was achieved with a small number of coils. No signs of recurrence were observed during the follow-up period.
   CONCLUSIONS: The multipronged approach is safe and effective for embolization of a small tortuous artery and shunt segment to avoid incomplete shunt occlusion.

DT Article
DE Papillary glioneuronal tumor; Recurrent tumor
ID FEATURES; CDKN2A
AB BACKGROUND: Papillary glioneuronal tumors (PGNTs) are rare World Health Organization grade I neoplasms that are characterized by a benign course and excellent response to surgical resection. A few reports exist of tumors with more aggressive clinical and histologic features. In this report we detail the case of an unusually aggressive PGNT in a 67-year-old woman.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient had a 3-year history of seizures and was diagnosed with a frontoparietal mass on imaging. She underwent subtotal resection with a histologic diagnosis of PGNT. Less than a year after surgery, the patient experienced recurrence of disease and underwent reresection and adjuvant radiation treatment. The patient's disease continued to progress despite radiation treatment, so adjuvant temozolomide was initiated. Molecular testing was performed and revealed a TERT promotor mutation, an FGFR3-TACC3 oncogenic fusion, and a copy number loss in CDKN2A/CDKN2B.
   CONCLUSIONS: PGNTs, while typically benign, can rarely recur after surgery. Molecular testing should be performed on all PGNTs to help possibly identify more aggressive tumors and potentially reveal novel treatment options.

   MANAGEMENT; LESIONS; OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment of brain metastases recurring after radiosurgery (BMRS) remains an area of active investigation. Stereotactic laser ablation (SLA, also known as laser interstitial thermal therapy) has recently emerged as a potential treatment option.
   OBJECTIVE: To summarize the available literature on SLA as treatment of BMRS and synthesize findings on local control, overall survival, neurologic outcome, imaging findings, morbidity, and postprocedure clinical course.
   METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search of PubMed for articles investigating SLA as treatment of BMRS.
   RESULTS: Thirteen peer-reviewed publications met our search criteria. Local control was a function of the percentage of tumor that was thermally ablated. In completely ablated tumors, 3-month local control was 80%-100%. Median survival ranged from 5.8 to 19.8 months. About two-thirds of treated lesions showed postablation expansion of contrast-enhancing volume and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery volume. Expansion could start within an hour of treatment, and resolution typically occurred within 6 months. Notably, maximal expanded contrast-enhancing volume could reach >3-fold the preoperative lesion volume. The incidence of SLA-related permanent neurologic injuries was <10%. The most common complications were hemorrhage, thermal injury causing neurologic deficit, and malignant cerebral edema. Nearly all patients were treated with dexamethasone, but there was variability in the dose and duration of therapy. Median hospital stay was 1-2 days (range, 1-5 days), and most treated patients were discharged home (range, 59.5%-100%).
   CONCLUSION: Our analysis provides support for continued development of SLA as a treatment of BMRS. Standardization of periprocedural management will be needed.

AB BACKGROUND: Subacute posttraumatic ascending myelopathy (SPAM) involves the rise in high signal intensity on T2-weighted images >= 4 vertebral segments above the initial injured site, and it usually occurs within the first few weeks after the injury. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of traumatic spinal cord damage are not clearly understood; however, there are some pathophysiologic processes such as arterial thrombosis, venous thrombosis, congestive ischemia, inflammatory or autoimmune reaction, and infection in the form of meningitis or myelitis that could lead to SPAM.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of T7 fracture because of left shoulder gunshot injury and ascending myelopathy up to the C2 vertebra level, which occurred 1 week after the gunshot injury, without pretraumatic cervical injury or syringomyelia. Although control magnetic resonance imaging findings showed the second rise in the high signal intensity level of the spinal cord, T2-weighted signal intensity and cord edema decreased and the patient showed neurologic improvement.
   CONCLUSIONS: This was the first case in the literature that showed rise 2 times in high signal intensity level in the spinal cord because of gunshot injury. Inflammatory reactions and secondary injury processes might have led to neurologic deterioration and ascending myelopathy in our case; therefore, the patient may have shown neurologic improvement after methylprednisolone therapy because of its anti-inflammatory and antiedema effects. There is no clear evidence whether neurologic improvement is associated with steroid therapy or it is because of the natural course of SPAM.

AB The article is dedicated to the life and work of Dr. Roy Selby (1930-2002), an American neurosurgeon who founded neurosurgery in Malaysia. Dr. Selby stayed in Malaysia from July 1963 to May 1970. He opened the first neurosurgical department at the general hospital in Kuala Lumpur and established a training program under which Malaysian physicians and nurses were sent to neurosurgery centers in the United States and Canada. Some physicians came back and headed local neurosurgical units. On his return to the United States, Dr. Selby practiced neurosurgery until 1986, when he had to give it up due to the impact of progressive congestive heart failure. From 1986 to 1994, Dr. Selby taught graduate courses in the Department of Psychology at East Texas State University, Texarkana, Texas. He was a pioneer of spinal surgery and founded the Lumbar Spine Society. Dr. Selby was a world citizen neurosurgeon and advocated international standards of training in neurosurgery. From 1985 to 1994, he was chairman of the Archives Committee of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. Dr. Selby serves as a model of a physician as a humanist.

DT Review
DE Foramen magnum; Meningioma; Spinal accessory nerve
AB BACKGROUND: Meningiomas that arise from the cranial nerve are rare. We present a case with an intradural extramedullary tumor at the foramen magnum originating from the spinal accessory nerve.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 69-year-old woman with dizziness and pain in the bilateral shoulder for 2 years. Neurologic examination revealed spinal accessory nerve palsy (difficult in raising the shoulder, deficit of 3/5) on the left side without further deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging showed medullar compression because of a left intradural extramedullary foramen magnum lesion dorsolateral to the medulla. Surgical exposure via a midline suboccipital approach with C1 laminectomy revealed that the lesion arises from the left accessory nerve without dural attachment. The tumor was resected without injury to the spinal accessory nerve, and histologic examination revealed that it was a meningothelial meningioma. The spinal accessory nerve palsy improved to 4 of 5 after 3 months after surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of an accessory nerve meningioma at the foramen magnum in which the spinal accessory nerve palsy appeared before operation and improved after tumor resection.

TI Solitary Metastasis of Adenocarcinoma of Submandibular Gland to Choroid
   Plexus in Cerebellopontine Angle: First Case Reported in Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article

ID CARCINOMA; HEAD
AB BACKGROUND: Adenocarcinoma of the salivary gland (AdCASG) is a rare and malignant tumor of the salivary glands. Albeit, metastatic lesions occur anecdotally in the choroid plexus and most rarely in the cerebellopontine angle (CPA). We report the first case of metastatic AdCASG to the choroid plexus of the lateral recess of the fourth ventricle located in CPA, emphasizing the clinical presentation and neuroradiologic findings.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 40-year-old man was referred with signs of increased intracranial pressure and a unilateral hearing problem. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a pear-shaped, vividly enhancing tumor in the left CPA. The tumor was a metastatic AdCASG. Gross total resection of the lesion was followed by a conventional radiotherapy lead in a 5-year tumor-free control interval.
   CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic lesions to the choroid plexus may show a pedunculated shape in magnetic resonance imaging. It is hypothesized that tumor seeding may occur through the veins, lymphatics, and nerve sheaths in the skull base region. Tissue specimen is necessary to confirm such rare pathology.

TI Giant Aneurysm Arising from Anomalous Branch of the Middle Cerebral
   Artery in a Pediatric Patient: Case Report and Review of the Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Intracranial aneurysm; Middle cerebral artery
ID INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS; CHILDREN; POPULATION; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Pediatric intracranial aneurysms are extremely rare. In this age group, cerebral vascular anomalies have been associated with the development of intracranial aneurysms.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of a previously well 11-year-old boy presented with seizures secondary to a giant, unruptured, and partially thrombosed right middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm. Extensive workup for underlying infective and autoimmune etiology was negative. Of interest, this vascular lesion was found to originate from an anomalous M2 branch, which ran an aberrant parallel course within the Sylvian fissure to the main and distally bifurcating MCA. The patient underwent successful surgical clipping and excision of the giant aneurysm.
   CONCLUSIONS: Because of the infrequency of the diagnosis, clinical pre-sentation, and its unique neurovascular anatomy, the management of this case is discussed in corroboration with current literature. In addition, highlighting this unusual case in an individual adds to the growing body of literature for better disease understanding, especially in the pediatric population.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Arteriovenous malformation; Radiation-induced changes; Stereotactic
   radiosurgery; X-knife
ID RADIOSURGERY; EMBOLIZATION
AB BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are potentially dangerous vascular anomalies of the brain that can cause seizures or intracranial hemorrhage in patients if left untreated. Because full excision of these lesions is not always possible in deep or eloquent areas of the brain, radiosurgical advances have gone a long way in the control and treatment of AVMs. Postradiosurgery AVMs are followed closely via outpatient clinics with serial imaging every few months to assess AVM obliteration. Post X-knife treatment AVMs still carry with them some risk of rebleeding and even a chance of malignant transformation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In this article, we report a case of a post X-knife - (sic) arteriovenous malformation with the appearance of malignant change on magnetic resonance imaging and thallium-201 on follow-up 30 years after treatment. Imaging with magnetic resonance angiography showed obliteration of the lesion but progressive change in size with new soft tissue components, which suggests radiation-related secondary malignancy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgery was arranged, and pathology results indicate no malignant change.

   CLASSIFICATION
AB OBJECTIVE: Estimating the risk of recurrence after surgery remains crucial during care of patients with meningioma. Numerous studies identified correlations of characteristics on routine preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with postoperative recurrence or high-grade histology but showed partially inconclusive results.
   METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed about findings on preoperative MRI and their correlation with high-grade histology and recurrence. Quality of the included studies was analyzed using standardized Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies criteria.
   RESULTS: Among the 35 studies included, quality of the series according to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies criteria differed widely. Remarkably, MRI variables found to be associated with high-grade histology were commonly not consistently associated with prognosis and vice versa. Correlations of the tumor size, the peritumoral edema size, and contrast-enhancement of the tumor capsule with high-grade histology were controversial. In most studies, non-skull base tumor location, cyst formation, heterogenous contrast-enhancement, an irregular tumor shape, and disruption of the tumor/brain border but not intensity of the lesion on T2-weighted images, calcifications, or bone involvement were associated with grade II/III histology. Although tumor and edema size were usually found to correlate with recurrence, heterogenous contrast enhancement, cyst formation, intensity of the tumor on T2-weighted MRI, and enhancement of the tumor capsule were mostly not related with progression.
   CONCLUSIONS: Several mostly consistent but partially inconsistent variables associated with high-grade histology or prognosis were identified. Although standardized studies are needed to provide further clarification, consideration of these findings can help to improve estimation of prognosis and can therefore improve postoperative care in patients with meningioma.

   hematoma; Surgical decompression
ID IMAGING FINDINGS; RESOLUTION
AB BACKGROUND: Traumatic spinal subdural hematoma is an extremely rare occurrence that requires urgent investigation and most often prompt intervention. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case related to a spinal manipulative therapy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This report describes a case of traumatic lumbar subdual hematoma after a spinal manipulative therapy without any predisposing factor. A 23-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department for partial cauda equina syndrome after a spinal manipulation performed by a physiotherapist. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an acute spinal subdural hematoma at L2-L3 level with cauda equina compression. The patient underwent an emergency L2 laminectomy with evacuation of the hematoma. He recovered completely his neurologic functions after 1 week.
   CONCLUSION: Practitioners of spinal manipulations should be aware of spinal subdural hematoma as a possible complication. A rapid diagnosis with magnetic resonance imaging is mandatory, and emergency surgical decompression is usually the optimal treatment for spinal subdural hematomas with severe neurologic deficit.

AB We herein report a rare case of intraparenchymal meningioma in the right basal ganglia. The tumor was located incidentally and preoperatively diagnosed as malignant glioma. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the tumor involved the lenticulostriate artery, and open biopsy was performed to avoid postoperative neurologic deficits. Pathologic diagnosis was fibrous meningioma, and the patient was treated with stereotactic radiation therapy using intensity-modulated radiation therapy. The case illustrates that preoperative evaluation of tumors in the basal ganglia is challenging and that intraparenchymal meningioma should be included in the differential diagnosis of basal ganglia tumors.

AB BACKGROUND: Aneurysm rerupture and bilateral fixed and dilated pupils (bFDPs) typically have a poor prognosis across all age groups. The synchronous occurrence of both features in the infantile demographic has not been previously reported.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe the near-fatal clinical course of a 7-month-old infant who experienced an acute giant aneurysm rerupture with signs of bFDPs. The patient was rapidly managed with neurosurgical intervention and has achieved a favorable outcome 1 year later.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights that survival of infants who present with intracranial aneurysmal rerupture and bFDPs is amenable to rapid neurosurgical intervention and should be remembered in clinical practice.

AB BACKGROUND: Atypical rhabdoid teratoid tumors are very rare embryonal tumors that typically affect children younger than 3 years old and are encountered intracranially.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here, we describe the case of a 19-year-old woman who presented with gait disturbances and coccydynia. Imaging revealed a cauda equina mass. The tumor was partially resected. Histology reported loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression and therefore the diagnosis of atypical rhab doi d teratoid was established. The patient underwent radiation treatment, but within 3 months 2 relapses were manifested.
   CONCLUSIONS: Atypical rhabdoid teratoids are exceptionally rare in adults are seld..m found in spine; only 8 such cases have been reported in the medical literature. They are invariantly characterized by multiple relapses and dismal prognosis. The clinician must be attentive of leptomeningeal disseminations and 22q11 deletion-associated comorbidities.

ID CEREBELLOPONTINE ANGLE; PILOCYTIC ASTROCYTOMA
AB BACKGROUND: Nontectal plate exophytic brainstem gliomas with pilocytic histology are rare and occur mainly in children. Because of their eloquent location, therapy usually consists of bioptic histologic verification and radio-therapy in case of progression.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report on a 43-year-old patient who presented with intermittent tinnitus and reduced hearing in his left ear, as well as a slight left-sided ataxia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a left-sided solid cystic cerebellar-pontine angle (CPA) tumor completely obliterating the CPA. Radiologically, a solid cystic vestibular schwannoma was diagnosed. Intraoperatively, a glossy-grayish, intensively bleeding tumor without any capsule or delineation to the brainstem or cranial nerves was resected using electrophysiologic monitoring. Postoperative histology revealed a pilocytic astrocytoma. Three months postoperatively, hearing was preserved (pure tone average-35 dB) and ataxia was equal to what it was preoperatively, gradually becoming better. Postoperative magnetic resonance scans demonstrated a complete resection of the tumor with completely restored brainstem contours.
   CONCLUSIONS: Exophytic brainstem gliomas may occur in the CPA and mimic vestibular schwannoma. Complete resection even with preserved hearing without neurologic deterioration may be feasible.

AB Rupture of the spinal dermoid is rare. There may be intracranial deposition of fat secondary to it. We report a case of an adult male who presented with features of obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to ruptured lumbar dermoid. A 42-year-male presented with acute-onset headache and vomiting for 2 days. There was grade 3 papilledema on fundus examination. Magnetic resonance imaging showed ventriculomegaly with aqueductal obstruction. Multiple T1 and T2 hyperintense deposits were also noted along the ventricular wall. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine showed a T1, T2 hyperintense intramedullary lesion at the lumbar region with multiple fat deposits along the spinal axis. He underwent endoscopic third ventriculostomy and is doing well at the 6-month follow-up. He is asymptomatic for the spinal lesion. Silent rupture of the spinal dermoid causing obstructive hydrocephalus is rare. These patients may remain asymptomatic for the spinal lesion and improves with cerebrospinal fluid diversion.

   Labelling
AB BACKGROUND: Hemangioblastomas of the optic nerve are very rare tumors. They occur in association with Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome; however, sporadic occurrences have been reported. We describe here a case of optic nerve hemangioblastoma in the absence of VHL and review the pertinent literature.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 33-year-old woman presented with gradually progressive vision loss in the right eye. On examination, the visual acuity on the right was hand movement close to face in all quadrants. Color discrimination was impaired. Fundoscopy revealed optic atrophy and no other retinal pathology. There was relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. No neurocutaneous markers were found. Imaging revealed lesion isointense on T1, hyperintense on T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and showing relatively homogenous enhancement on postcontrast study. Multiple flow voids were seen in the intracranial part of the lesion. The proximal part of the intraorbital right optic nerve was enlarged and tortuous with distended optic nerve sheath. A right single-piece fronto-orbital craniotomy was done. A reddish lesion seen involving the right optic nerve just proximal to the chiasm with multiple vessels and a distinct feeding vessel was seen supplying the tumor. The lesion was excised and the optic nerve was sacrificed approximately 1 cm proximal to the chiasm. The postoperative course was uneventful.
   CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions: Optic nerve hemangioblastoma is a rare occurrence and a high level of suspicion is required preoperatively in the absence of VHL syndrome.

   PSEUDOANEURYSM; COMPLICATIONS; FIXATION
AB PURPOSE: Aortic injury by pedicle screw is rare but can cause serious complications. It has not been clearly determined when aortic repair is necessary in cases of screw impingement without perforation of the aortic wall. In this article, we review the treatment and clinical course of pedicle screw aortic impingement and attempt to clarify this issue.
   METHODS: Cases of aortic injury during thoracic screw procedures were found using a MEDLINE search and analyzed together with 3 new cases that we present.
   RESULTS: Nineteen cases collected from the literature and 3 new cases were included in the study. In 7 of the cases, aortic impingement by the pedicle screw was detected during postoperative follow-up (day 1) radiologic examinations. In the other cases, time to presentation of aortic impingement ranged between 2 weeks and 60 months after fixation. The main indications for thoracic spinal fixation were post-traumatic vertebral fracture and kyphoscoliosis/scoliosis. Repair of the aortic damage ranged from primary repair to stent and tube graft placement by the thoracic endovascular aortic repair method.
   CONCLUSIONS: In cases in which the screw impinges less than 5 mm into the aortic wall, hardware revision without aortic repair may be sufficient if recognized early and there are no sign of aortic leakage in vascular imaging. However, cases with more than 5 mm of screw impingement should undergo aortic repair first, even in the absence of aortic leakage, following by screw revision.

   PATIENT; FISTULA; RUPTURE
AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial pseudoaneurysm is a rare entity, with few cases -Abed in the literature, and is mostly associated with a history of traumatic brain injury. Traumatic aneurysms comprise <1% of all intracranial aneurysms. In particular, middle meningeal artery (MMA) aneurysms are uncommon and usually caused by a skull fracture in the temporal region. About 40 traumatic MMA aneurysms are reported in the literature, and only 28 nontraumatic aneurysms are reported, usually related to high-flow conditions. The behavior of these aneurysms is largely unknown: both spontaneous resolution and aneurysm growth, leading to subsequent rupture, have been reported. Surgical and endovascular management are feasible for MMA aneurysms; however, the criterion standard treatment is not defined.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a traumatic pseudoaneurysm of the right MMA treated with an endovascular approach and provide a review of the literature.
   CONCLUSIONS: Aneurysms of the MMA are a rare entity that must be taken into account in the setting of a traumatic brain injury or predisposing factors. The diagnosis and aggressive treatment are mandatory, preventing the devastating consequences of their rupture. Endovascular and surgical techniques are well defined and available, even though there is not a demonstrated superiority in any of them.

AB BACKGROUND: Pilocytic astrocytoma is a benign glial tumor typically presenting in children. It is rare for adults to present with pilocytic astrocytoma and even less likely to manifest with multiple foci of lesions especially in nonoptic or hypothalamic locations.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Our patient was a 37-year old man presenting with varied cranial neuropathies, cerebellar dysfunction, and long tract signs, with imaging demonstrating 3 discrete ill-defined contrast-enhancing lesions affecting the cerebellar peduncles, brainstem, and cervicomedullary junction. Neuronavigation-guided biopsy confirmed World Health Organization grade 1 pilocytic astrocytoma; the patient was treated with radiotherapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, we believe this is the first reported case with multifocal infratentorial pilocytic astrocytoma on presentation in an adult patient in the absence of a prior history of associated risk factors such as neurofibromatosis 1 or chemoradiotherapeutic intervention.

AB BACKGROUND: We present 3 case reports to share our experience and explore the safety and efficacy of treating huge teardrop fracture of the axis (HTDFA).
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Case 1: A 47-year-old man suffered from generalized pain after falling from a height. Case 2: A 39-year-old woman suffered facial contusions and lacerations during a car accident, and her neck was sore. Case 3: A 51-year-old woman was hit in the face during a car accident, and her neck was sore. These 3 patients had limited neck movement and no nerve injury, and their radiographs showed HTDFA. The patients were treated with Zero-Profile (Zero-P) implant placement combined with miniscrew fixation.
   CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of HTDFA by Zero-P implant placement combined with miniscrew fixation is effective and stable. The last follow-up examination of the patients showed that fusion had been achieved, and their neck pain had disappeared. Anterior reduction, diskectomy, and Zero-P implantation combined with miniscrew fixation can be used to treat HTDFA. Both avulsed teardrop fragment removal and C2-3 bone grafting lead to bone healing. This method is effective, safe, and simple for the treatment of HTDFA.

DE Anticoagulant; Cerebrospinal fluid drainage; Intracranial aneurysm;

ID COMPLICATIONS
AB OBJECTIVE: Spinal subdural hematoma (S-SDH) rareiy occurs after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Little information is known regarding the management and prognosis of patients with both S-SDH and SAH. Here, we present an illustrative case and provide a systematic review of S-SDH in the setting of SAH.
   METHODS: A systematic literature review using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines revealed 11 previous cases of concurrent intracranial SAH and spinal SDH, which are presented with our new reported case.
   RESULTS: Intracranial sources of spontaneous SAH included 8 aneurysms, 1 pseudoaneurysm, and 3 angiogram-negative cases. Hunt Hess grades ranged from 1 to 4, mean time between SAH and S-SDH was 5.8 days, and S-SDH presented most frequently in the lumbar spine. Eight patients showed significant to complete clinical recovery, 2 had continued plegia of the lower extremities, and 2 expired. Modified Rankin scores (mRS) ranged from 0 to 6, with mRS >2 for 4 of 12 patients. Patients with a poor clinical outcome (mRS >2) had an initially negative cerebral angiogram, earlier presentation with less time between SAH and S-SDH (0.8 vs. 7.6 days), use of antithrombotic medication, no diversion of cerebrospinal fluid, and cervical or thoracic S-SDH.
   CONCLUSION: S-SDH is uncommon in the setting of aneurysmal SAH; better outcomes are associated with lumbar location, delayed presentation, cerebrospinal fluid diversion, and lack of antithrombotic use. Conservative treatment may be sufficient in patients with delayed S-SDH and lack of significant neurologic deficits. More reported cases will allow greater understanding of this clinical entity.

   Minimally invasive surgery; Tubular retractors
ID SURGICAL-TREATMENT; I-MALFORMATION; DURAPLASTY; SYRINGOMYELIA
AB BACKGROUND: An intraoperative technique for foramen magnum decompression of Chiari malformation is presented. The technique uses minimal exposure tubular retractors attached to a flexible arm to keep the retractor in a fixed position, while allowing flexible angulation under fluoroscopic guidance.
   METHODS: Operations were performed between 2009 and 2018 on 22 patients with cerebellar tonsillar descent below the foramen magnum and a diagnosis of type I Chiari malformation. A linear durotomy was necessary, but only the outer layer of the dura was opened for some patients, which is less invasive than the traditional procedure where a durotomy is performed for both the inner and outer layers, and then a duraplasty is performed.
   RESULTS: The approach allowed access to a wide working area, minimized soft tissue exposure, and optimized extent of decompression. The postoperative imaging demonstrated satisfactory bony removal, and magnetic resonance imaging of the area with cerebrospinal (CSF) flow study showed good CSF flow across the foramen magnum. There was a low incidence of postoperative complications, and the average length of hospital stay was 1 day. For 19 of 22 cases, the symptoms completely resolved or markedly improved, and each of the patients who attended the last follow-up demonstrated syrinx resolution.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience with this technique, when used to assist in foramen magnum decompression of Chiari malformation I, the minimally invasive tubular retractor is a useful tool, providing the surgeon with enhanced visualization of the operative field, while reducing potential damage to tissue and optimizing surgical outcomes.

TI Spontaneous Spinal Epidural Hematomas in Pregnancy: A Systematic Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Decompression; Hematoma; Spine
ID PATIENT
AB BACKGROUND: Spontaneous spinal epidural hematomas (SSEH) are rare yet severe conditions. In pregnancy, this condition is challenging to diagnose and treat because of the risks to the mother and fetus. This study reviews the literature on SSEHs in pregnancy.
   METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the English literature on SSEHs from 1990 until 2018. Outcome measures were mode of presentation, risk factors, initial neurologic findings, diagnostic investigations, site and size of the SSEH, treatment, neurologic recovery, and survival.
   RESULTS: Fourteen publications (16 patients) were included. Two patients presented in the second trimester, with the remainder in the third trimester. All patients presented with back pain, and 15 subsequently developed spinal cord dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in all cases. The cervicothoracic region was the most commonly affected, and the average hematoma size extended across 3.9 vertebral levels. All patients with neurologic dysfunction underwent surgical decompression. In women under 32 weeks' gestation, caesarean section was not routinely performed. In contrast, women of gestational age of 32 weeks or more underwent a caesarean section prior to spinal decompression. Women without neurologic dysfunction underwent a caesarean section and neurologic monitoring without decompression. All patients with abnormal neurology improved after surgery, except 1 patient. No patients died.
   CONCLUSIONS: In pregnancy, SSEHs typically present in the second or third trimesters with back pain, predominantly in the cervicothoracic region, followed by progressive neurologic dysfunction. MRI is diagnostic, and the treatment depends on the patient's neurologic dysfunction and gestational age.

AB OBJECTIVE: To present an adaptation of the anaglyph photography technique to be used with radiological images from computed tomography angiograms, enabling stereoscopic visualization of a patient's individual abnormal vascular anatomy for teaching, case discussion, or surgical planning purposes.
   METHODS: Traditional anaglyph procedures with actual objects yield 2 independent photographs, simulating the image perceived by each eye. Production of anaglyphs from angiograms involve 3 basic procedures: volume rendering, image capture, and image fusion. Volume renderings were reconstructed using a free, open-source DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) reader. Subsequently, the virtual object was positioned to mimic the operator's angle of view, and different perspectives of the reconstructed volume could be obtained through exclusively horizontal rotation. The 2 images were then fused after their color composition was modified so that each eye would perceive only 1 image when using anaglyph glasses.
   RESULTS: Forty-three angiograms were reviewed for the purpose of this study and a total of 6 examinations were selected for illustration of the technique. Stereoscopic display was possible for all of them and in the 3 types of support tested: computer monitor, tablet, and smartphone screens.
   CONCLUSIONS: Anaglyph display of computed tomography angiograms is an effective and low-cost alternative for the stereoscopic visualization of a patient's individual intracranial vascular anatomy.

AB Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) represent novel adjuncts for neurosurgical planning in neuro-oncology. In addition to established use in surgical and medical training, VR/AR are gaining traction for clinical use preoperatively and intraoperatively. To understand the utility of VR/AR in the clinical setting, we conducted a literature search in Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE with various search terms designed to capture the use of VR/AR in neurosurgical procedures for resection of cranial tumors. The search retrieved 302 articles, of which 35 were subjected to full-text review; 19 full-text articles were included in the review. Key findings highlighted by the individual authors were extracted and summarized into themes to present the value of VR/AR in the clinical setting. These studies included various VR/AR systems applied to surgeries involving heterogeneous pathologies and outcome measures. Overall, VR/AR were found to be qualitatively advantageous due to enhanced visualization of complex anatomy and improved intraoperative lesion localization. When these technologies were compared with existing neuronavigation systems, quantitative clinical benefits were also reported. The capacity to visualize three-dimensional images superimposed on patient anatomy is a potentially valuable tool in complex neurosurgical environments. Surgical limitations may be addressed through future advances in image registration and tracking as well as intraoperatively acquired imaging with the ability to yield real-time virtual models.

AB BACKGROUND: This study aimed to report the case of a patient who presented with depression, cognitive impairment, ataxic gait, and urinary incontinence associated with vitamin B12 deficiency.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Serum vitamin B12 level was low in this patient, and anti-intrinsic factor antibody was positive. Neuroimaging revealed abnormal hyperintense signals in the cerebellum and dorsal and lateral columns of the spinal cord, and obstructive hydrocephalus. A biopsy of the stomach revealed chronic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and atrophy. After 3 months of initiating methylcobalamin therapy, significant improvement was noticed clinically, and brain magnetic resonance imaging was near to normal.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study was novel in reporting subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord and hydrocephalus associated with vitamin B12 deficiency in adults.

TI Middle Meningeal Artery Embolization for the Treatment of an Expanding
   Epidural Hematoma
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Endovascular treatment; Epidural hematoma; Middle meningeal artery;
   Middle meningeal artery embolization
AB INTRODUCTION: Epidural hematomas (EHs) usually originate from traumatic injury to the middle meningeal artery (MMA). Although large Ells may need to be emergently evacuated, the management of smaller EHs is less clear, especially in the absence of significant mass effect or neurologic deficits. Endovascular treatment via MMA embolization for epidural hematomas has only been recently reported. Herein, we present a case whereby MMA embolization was performed to prevent further growth of an expanding, right-sided EH after a larger left EH was surgically evacuated.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 31-year-old male patient was brought to the emergency department after he was found down by the police at his house. He was initially conversant but quickly became obtunded within a few minutes. An initial scan showed bilateral (left larger than right) acute EHs, and the patient was taken to the operating room for a left craniotomy. Immediate postoperative imaging demonstrated an expanding right-sided EH. The patient was emergently taken to the endovascular suite and obvious contrast extravasation was noticed from the parietal branch of the MMA. The MMA was embolized via a transradial approach. Follow-up imaging revealed stable hematoma size without the need for additional surgery. The patient was discharged without any neurologic deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we report the successful endovascular treatment of an expanding EH following a contralateral craniotomy. Active bleeding of the MMA was observed via angiography and may predict further EH expansion. Endovascular exploration and possible treatment can be justified in patients with EH that do not have a clear surgical indication.

DT Article
DE Ganglioneuroma; Lumbar; Paravertebral body
ID FILUM TERMINALE; PARAGANGLIOMA
AB BACKGROUND: Ganglioneuroma is a well-differentiated benign tumor that develops from the ganglion cells of the posterior mediastinum, retroperitoneum, cervical spine, and adrenal glands. The paravertebral body, in which the sympathetic trunk exists, is a common tumor site, and tumor sometimes invades the spinal canal through the intervertebral foramen. There have been no reports regarding tumors with intradural and extradural continuity. We report a paravertebral ganglioneuroma extending between the intradural and extradural spaces and its surgical treatment.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 33-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with progressive left lower limb numbness. A dumbbell-type tumor progressing to the spinal canal via the left intervertebral foramen from the paravertebral body at L1-2 was detected, and intradural calcified lesions were found. Pathologic examination of a computed tomography-guided biopsy sample revealed a ganglio-glioma. The extradural tumor was removed; however, the left lower limb pain gradually worsened. As complete block was observed on myelography, the intradural tumor was removed 8 months later. Intraoperative findings revealed that the intradural and extradural tumors were continuous through the L1 nerve root.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first known reported case of paravertebral ganglioneuroma presenting in continuity between the intradural and extradural spaces.

ID HEMATOMA
AB OBJECTIVE: When performing burr hole endoscopic neurosurgery, it is necessary to get enough surgical corridor. We have used various instruments to extend burr hole size, but it was cumbersome to use so many tools.
   METHODS: In this report, we describe a novel instrument-a dilator attachment with a cordless handle to make it simple and safe to extend a burr hole. We developed this burr hole dilator attachment with blades on the side and an arc form on the bottom to prevent dural damage. It can be used to drill safely and efficiently. We describe some experiences of using this device.
   RESULTS: It is important to balance the maximization of operation range and surgical invasiveness for endoscopic neurosurgery. This new dilator for extending a burr hole is a safe, useful device to get enough surgical view and easily perform a surgical procedure in endoscopic surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our dilator for expanding a burr hole improves the work of endoscopic surgery on intracranial hemorrhagic lesions.

In this paper, we review the literature to present an overview of the remarkable historical journey that brought our forefathers to trace the pathway of individual cranial nerves from origin to destination. In particular, we discuss the evolution of the naming of the cranial nerves and highlight relevant eponymous descriptions. We also include some poignant illustrations of cranial nerves by ancient anatomists that set the scene to their discoveries. In reviewing this legacy, we summarize the important product of centuries of discoveries and investigations and the limitations of cranial nerve classification systems.

DE Francesco Durante; Neurosurgery; Surgical procedure
ID SURGERY
AB Francesco Durante was born in Sicily, precisely Letojanni Gallodoro. He contributed to the history of neurosurgery in not only Italy but the whole world. In June 1884, he removed a left frontal meningioma, describing a personal technique of craniotomy with a discontinuous osteotangential section flap. It was the first such operation to be performed in any country after which the patient had a long survival. The important and pioneering contribution made by Durante to the history of neurosurgery is testified by his Treaty on Pathology and Surgical Therapy. Durante's procedure for craniotomy remained the best for several years. His contributions are still valid in medicine today, within not only the neurosurgical community but also other surgical disciplines, because he also developed innovative practices in the fields of oncology, general surgery, and orthopedics in addition to designing special surgical instruments.

ID DE-NOVO ANEURYSM; EXTRACRANIAL-INTRACRANIAL BYPASS; INTRACEREBRAL
   HEMORRHAGE; RUPTURED ANEURYSM; SURGERY; PSEUDOANEURYSM
AB BACKGROUND: Direct extracranial to intracranial (EC-IC) bypass is a valuable treatment option for symptomatic occlusive cerebrovascular disease and complex intracranial aneurysms. Aneurysm formation at or near the anastomotic site is a rarely reported phenomenon, and the pathophysiology and appropriate management of such de novo aneurysms are not clear.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we present the case of a superficial temporal to middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomosis that was complicated by aneurysm formation at the anastomotic site. This was treated with microsurgical clipping with preservation of the bypass. Pathologic analysis of the lesion was consistent with a pseudoaneurysm. We provide a literature review of this phenomenon, which is most often associated with low-flow STA-MCA bypasses, including review of the pathologic findings associated with it.
   CONCLUSION: Pseudoaneurysm formation at the site of an EC-IC bypass is a rare phenomenon that should be recognized and treated to prevent further growth and rupture.

ID TUMORS; GUIDELINES; PET/CT; BRAIN
AB BACKGROUND: Neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) originates with neuroendocrine cells and is mainly found in the pancreas, lungs and gastrointestinal tract. We surgically treated a case of primary unknown NEC with only cerebral metastasis that mimicked hemangioblastoma. Recurrence was seen at the fornix, and no primary lesion had been identified as of 2 years after treatments despite careful examination.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 61-year-old man presented with dizziness. Past medical history included hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia and colon polyp. We performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the cause of dizziness, revealing tumor with enhancement and peritumoral edema at the right cerebral lesion. Contrast-enhanced whole-body computed tomography (CT) showed no other lesions. We suspected hemangioblastoma from examinations and decided on surgical resection. Neuropathologically, the resected tumor was diagnosed as brain metastasis of NEC, but CT, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography, gastrointestinal endoscopy, and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy all failed to reveal the primary lesion. As postoperative MRI showed enhancement around the resection cavity and at the right fornix, radiotherapy was performed. No other lesions were seen at 24 months post-operatively. We are continuing careful monitoring and no chemotherapy has been administered.
   CONCLUSIONS: We treated brain metastasis from NEC of unknown primary and mimicking hemangioblastoma using only local treatment. When an enhancing, single, solid tumor is seen in the cerebellum, brain metastasis from NEC of unknown primary is 1 differential diagnosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial metastasis is a common complication of systemic malignancy. A rare subset of intracranial masses constitutes tumor-totumor metastasis, in which an extracranial neoplasm hematogenously spreads to an existing intracranial lesion.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we present the unique case of a 59-year-old man with known hepatocellular carcinoma who presented with acute headaches, double vision, vertigo, and gait instability in the context of 2 years of right-sided hearing loss. Head imaging showed a heterogeneous right cerebellopontine angle mass extending into the porus acousticus with adjacent cerebellar edema. Histopathologic analysis after resection found coexisting hepatocellular carcinoma within a vestibular schwannoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Tumor-to-tumor metastasis is an important consideration in the diagnostic work-up and treatment of patients with known systemic malignancy who present with a new intracranial lesion. This pathologic entity could be missed if this patient were treated with single-fraction radiosurgery such as Gamma Knife.

ID ARTERY
AB BACKGROUND: Spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas are the most common spinal vascular pathology, accounting for up to 70% of spinal vascular malformations. They most commonly present with insidious and progressive myelopathy and bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction. Although noninvasive imaging (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography) may suggest the presence of a spinal arteriovenous fistula (AVF), the diagnosis requires confirmation with spinal angiography.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 65-year-old woman presented with progressive myelopathy. Traditional spinal angiography of the paired radicular arteries failed to demonstrate any vascular malformation. However, injection of the right internal iliac artery demonstrated an AVF arising from the artery of Desproges-Gofteron with retrograde venous drainage to the upper thoracic region.
   CONCLUSIONS: Selective transarterial catheterization and embolization with n-butyl cyanoacrylate resulted in complete occlusion of the AVF. Clinical improvement was also noted on postprocedural day 1. This case highlights the importance of internal iliac injections as a critical component of spinal angiography during an evaluation for vascular malformation.

TI Case Report of De Novo Cavernous Carotid Artery Aneurysm After an Acute

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article

   Embolization; Flow diversion
ID ISCHEMIC-STROKE; DISSECTION; AGE
AB BACKGROUND: Arterial dissections are a common cause of stroke in second decade-fourth decade patients, but may occur at any age. There are no previous reports of an intracranial carotid artery dissection that evolved spontaneously into both complications (i.e., stroke, pseudoaneurysm). To our knowledge, this is the first case of arterial dissection complicated by an occlusion and a pseudoaneurysm occurring at the same site.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient is a 57-year-old woman who was found by a family member with complete right-side weakness and without the ability to communicate. On admission, her National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 18 and her cerebral angiogram showed a left cavernous carotid occlusion. Mechanical thrombectomy failed to open the occlusion; therefore, an enterprise stent was deployed. Four weeks after the left internal carotid artery (ICA) stent placement, the patient presented with a complete ptosis of the left eye with minimally reactive pupil and a third nerve palsy. Computed tomography angiogram showed an 8-mm aneurysm of the left cavernous ICA. A cerebral angiogram was performed and showed a 10- x 7-mm cavernous pseudoaneurysm. The decision was made to treat the aneurysm with Pipeline-assisted coiling. The procedure went well without any complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial dissection/occlusion is a frequent cause of brain infarction, especially in mid-adulthood. Clinical signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage, compressive nerve palsies, and epistaxis in a patient who had endovascular treatment for an intracranial arterial dissection occlusion should be considered as signs for pseudoaneurysm formation, and an angiography should be obtained as soon as possible.

AB BACKGROUND: Spontaneous isolated carotid artery (CA) or vertebral artery (VA) dissection in the absence of coarctation has rarely been reported in the literature. We report the case of a 20-year-old woman with Turner syndrome (TS) who developed an acute left middle cerebral artery territory ischemic stroke from a spontaneous left internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection. We also conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify prior studies establishing an association or other case reports of isolated CA or VA dissection in TS. We queried 5 databases: MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Central, and CINAHL EBSCO, We used a standardized search clause across databases. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to articles retrieved. Studies were excluded based on title alone, abstract, or after vetting the data presented in the paper.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Three case reports of patients with TS presenting with spontaneous intracranial and/or extracranial dissection of the ICA or VA were identified and included in this review.
   CONCLUSIONS: We present a case of bilateral spontaneous dissection of the ICA in a patient with TS. Only 3 reported cases of spontaneous extra- or intracranial dissection of the CA or VA were identified via a systematic review of the literature. Arterial dissection of the CA or VA, especially in absence of aortic coarctation, in individuals affected with TS suggest the possibility of systemic vasculopathy. More research is needed to establish a better understanding of the phenotypic effects of TS in macro- and microvascular structures.

   DIAGNOSIS; PATHOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND: Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an uncommon, yet life-threatening postoperative neuropathic complication that is easily neglected, and hence, timely treatment is not provided in the clinics. This review aims to summarize the clinical features of postoperative GBS, and thus, improve the understanding of postoperative GBS.
   METHODS: We reviewed the literature on postoperative GBS and assessed de-graphic information, clinical manifestation, operation, time of onset of postoperative GBS, and prognosis.
   RESULTS: A total of 33 cases of postoperative GBS were included in this study. The average age of patients with postoperative GBS was 46.9 years, and there was a peak in occurrence of GBS between ages 50 and 70 years. Men seemed more likely to have postoperative GBS than did women, with a ratio of 2.67:1. Progressive muscular weakness, present in 31 of the cases, was the most common presentation. Patients with spinal surgery were at further increased risk for GBS, and 84.8% of the patients with GBS had a good prognosis after prompt treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgery is probably a potential risk factor for the occurrence GBS. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are imperative to reduce mortality.

ID ORBITOZYGOMATIC CRANIOTOMY; MENINGIOMAS; EXPERIENCE; ANTERIOR; TIPS
AB BACKGROUND: The extended supraorbital approach through a modified eyebrow incision is a minimally invasive variant of the frontotemporal or pterional approach that enriches a neurosurgeon's armamentarium for the treatment of pathologies lateral to the anterior clinoid process, by advancing laterally with frontal facial nerve branches monitoring. To demonstrate the steps of the approach, we studied 2 formalin-fixed and artery/vein silicone-injected adult cadaveric heads, and reviewed 1 of the 3 clinical cases operated on to illustrate the applicability of the approach.
   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old woman presented with a history of seizures and a complaint of headache that started 2 months ago. She underwent an examination with brain magnetic resonance imaging that showed a dural-based lesion at the medial third of the lesser wing of sphenoid (which is consistent with meningioma). The patient underwent craniotomy with an extended supraorbital approach through a modified eyebrow incision that allowed Simpson grade II removal to be performed and good aesthetic outcome to be achieved.
   CONCLUSIONS: The extended supraorbital approach through a modified eyebrow incision is a minimally invasive approach that can add to a neurosurgeon's armamentarium and be used with microscopy, assisted by endoscope, or both to reach the anterior and middle cranial fossae.

LA English
DT Article
DE Coil embolization; Persistent primitive trigeminal artery; Stent;
   Traumatic carotid-cavernous fistula
AB BACKGROUND: Persistent primitive trigeminal artery (PPTA) is the most common type of fetal carotid-basilar persisting communication in adulthood; however, carotid-cavernous fistulas (CCFs) associated with PPTA are rare.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 84-year-old woman presented with traumatic CCF associated with PPTA manifesting as vascular bruit. Transarterial embolization was performed. Although a detachable coil was deployed at the fistula point, it was easy to migrate into the cavernous sinus because of the high-flow shunt. Therefore, a stent was deployed in the PPTA, and the inner lumen of the stent with a focus on the fistula point was occluded by using coils. Subsequently, the CCF completely disappeared.
   CONCLUSIONS: In-stent coil embolization was effective and reasonable for the high-flow CCF associated with the PPTA. This method reduced the number of coils required and operating time. However, careful preservation of perforators is needed.

   ADENOMA; SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Pituitary apoplexy may occur when a large tumor compresses or outgrows its nutrient supply, resulting in ischemic necrosis and hemorrhage. Although once deemed a neurosurgical emergency, increasing evidence suggests that conservative management of pituitary apoplexy leads to favorable neuro-ophthalmologic and endocrinologic outcomes as well. Spontaneous remission after pituitary apoplexy has been described in functioning pituitary adenomas, but it is a rare occurrence in nonfunctioning tumors.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a man that presented with pituitary apoplexy of a nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenoma that was managed conservatively and treated hormonally for hypopituitarism during a 2-year follow-up period, with serial neuroimaging demonstrating significant tumor volume reduction with almost complete resolution resulting in partial empty sella. In addition, a short literature review was performed pertaining to the management of pituitary anoplexy with emphasis on a more conservative approach.
   CONCLUSIONS: A subset of patients with pituitary apoplexy without altered consciousness and nonprogressive or mild ophthalmologic deficits may be managed conservatively; however, lifelong periodic assessment, preferably by a specialized multidisciplinary pituitary team, is essential until clinical outcomes become clear.

AB BACKGROUND: The optimal approach of blood blister-like aneurysms (BBAs) is debated. Wrapping has been reported to be an effective strategy, but artificial materials have often been used. In addition, perforator protection is difficult using this technique. In this case, we report a ruptured BBA of the left internal carotid artery (ICA) treated with a clip-reinforced wrapping technique using Y-shaped autologous temporalis fascia to protect the posterior communicating artery (PComA). The outcome was favorable.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 48-year-old woman was admitted for subarachnoid hemorrhage. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed a BBA located opposite the PComA origin. A frontotemporal craniotomy was performed. The temporalis fascia was isolated from the temporalis muscle, and then tailored into a Y shape for the PComA to pass through. The diseased segment and the BBA were then wrapped by the Y-shaped temporalis fascia circumferentially. Two clips were applied to the fascia to reinforce the wrapping to fit snugly enough around the parent artery subsequently. DSA and computed tomography angiography scan postoperation showed that the BBA had not recurred, the supraclinoid segment of the left ICA had reconstructed well, and the PComA was unobstructed. The patient recovered without any sequelae during the 1-year follow-up period.
   CONCLUSIONS: A clip-reinforced wrapping technique using Y-shaped temporalis fascia may be an effective method for treating BBAs located opposite the PComA origin. Long-term follow-up and large sample size studies, however, are necessary to validate this approach.

ID SUBACUTE COMBINED DEGENERATION; DORSAL COLUMN MYELOPATHY; METHOTREXATE;
   NEUROTOXICITY; DEXTROMETHORPHAN; HOMOCYSTEINE; CHILDREN
AB BACKGROUND: Myelopathy of the dorsal columns is a rare complication of intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy that occurs most frequently with IT methotrexate and cytarabine. This diagnosis is made with a combination of magnetic resonance imaging, somatosensory evoked potentials, and elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein levels, particularly myelin basic protein.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 73-year-old man with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm and known central nervous system involvement underwent standard treatment, including 5 doses of IT cytosine arabinoside. Following this, he had documented CSF clearance of disease. One year later, he developed progressive lower extremity weakness, numbness, and bowel/bladder dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging and repeat CSF analysis demonstrated recurrence, and he underwent further IT administration of methotrexate and cytarabine. CSF clearance of malignant cells was again established. However, weakness progressed to quadriplegia; loss of bowel/bladder control; and severe sensory loss, particularly vibration and proprioception. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated high signal intensity in bilateral posterior columns. A lower thoracic spine dorsal column biopsy revealed cord destruction and diffuse macrophage infiltration with profound destruction of the neuropil.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although dorsal column myelopathy has previously been described in association with IT chemotherapy, this has solely been diagnosed on the basis of clinical examination, electrodiagnostic criteria, radiographic findings, and CSF analysis. This case provides a pathologic evaluation of an antemortem obtained specimen revealing diffuse macrophage infiltration and profound destruction of the neuropil. Whereas the mechanism underlying spinal cord toxicity following IT chemotherapy remains largely unknown, this case demonstrates a potentially macrophage-mediated process.

   Transdural herniation
AB BACKGROUND: Intradural lumbar disc herniation is rare, with an incidence of 0.3%-1%, but has been well reported in the literature. Transdural migration of the disc penetrating both ventral and dorsal dura is extremely rare, and there is a dearth of literature in the pathophysiology and surgical management of transdural herniation. Lack of knowledge on this type of presentation can cause intraoperative surprises and inadvertent cauda equina root injuries and lead to prolonged operative time. We report 1 such case, describe our surgical experience, and discuss the pathological mechanisms and signs.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 30-year-old woman presented to outpatient clinic with chronic cauda equina syndrome due to massive L4-L5 disc herniation. 14-15 decompression and transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion were planned. Unexpectedly, however, surgery revealed a transdural herniation, which was effectively managed with laminectomy, extension of durotomy, discectomy, repair of both dorsal and ventral dura, and interbody fusion, but at the expense of prolonged surgical time.
   CONCLUSIONS: Transdural herniation of a lumbar disc is very rare presentation. It can be effectively managed with laminectomy, extension of durotomy, discectomy and repair of both dorsal and ventral dura. It can be diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging preoperatively only if read with suspicion of such presentation.

DT Article
DE Dural sinus stenting; Malignant increased intracranial hypertension;
   Posttraumatic cerebral venous sinus thrombosis
ID SKULL FRACTURE; HEAD-INJURY
AB BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a major complication after head injury. Impaired venous outflow caused by CVST leads to increased intracranial pressure (IICP) refractory to medications and surgical decompression and often results in devastating consequences. Currently, there is no consensus on the treatment strategy.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Here we report a case of posttraumatic CVST in a young male motorcyclist involved in a high-speed traffic accident. On admission, the patient immediately underwent decompressive hemicraniectomy. However, refractory malignant IICP developed within 24 hours after the operation. Computed tomography venography revealed compression of the right sigmoid sinus by the fractured temporal bone and extensive thrombosis toward the jugular bulb. Dural sinus thrombectomy and stenting were performed accordingly. After the procedure, IICP was alleviated immediately and the sedatives and medications were tapered off within days. The patient gradually recovered from deep comatose status and underwent cranioplasty 5 weeks later. Finally, the patient was discharged with only mild left wrist weakness.
   CONCLUSIONS: Acute cerebral sinus thrombosis caused by trauma may result in malignant IICP refractory to medications and surgical decompression. We have demonstrated that endovascular angioplasty and sinus stenting are effective in restoring venous outflow and reducing intracranial pressure. We have also demonstrated that appropriate and timely interventions are important to ensure quick and good recovery in patients with CVST.

   Friedrich Panse; Ludwig Guttmann; Postwar Germany
AB Sir Ludwig Guttmann's pioneering work in the treatment of spinal injury not only improved the care for patients with paraplegia up to now but revolutionized basic principles of neurorehabilitation. A wide selection of publications honors the personal and academic life of this singular German neurologist and neurosurgeon of Jewish descent. When the Nazis came into power, Guttmann was dismissed from his hospital workplace, humiliated, and later forced to leave Germany. Surprisingly, after the Second World War, the psychiatrist Friedrich Panse, who had been a member of the Nazi party, initiated Guttmann's academic rehabilitation up to his nomination as emeritus professor of Cologne University in 1964. The present article recounts the difficult academic restitution and poses the question why Guttmann sought to re-establish connections to Germany, a country that had expelled him so harshly some decades before.

ID INTRACRANIAL MENINGIOMA; ANGIOMA; MIMICKING; MALFORMATION
AB BACKGROUND: Dural presentation of a cavernous hemangioma is a rare occurrence. Classically an intraparenchymal lesion with varying symptomatology including mostly headaches, seizures, and neurologic deficits depending on its location, a few cases have been reported along the convexity of the brain, even less eroding the calvaria, with none occasioning abnormal movements as the initial presentation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This is a case of a 67-year-old male who presented to the clinic for atypical progressive choreiform movements of the right side of his body and a soft subgaleal mass. Radiographic imaging showed a parietal tumor with intradural and extradural invasion mimicking a meningioma, which does not provide, given its location, a clear explanation of the symptoms. A craniotomy was performed on 29 January, 2018, during which the tumor was resected along with the invaded dura mater and calvaria.
   CONCLUSIONS: A pathology report was positive for cavernous hemangioma, an unexpected diagnosis based on the tumor's characteristics. After surgery, the patient recovered completely without residual symptoms, suggesting a compressive mass effect causing the atypical movement disorders.

AB BACKGROUND: The benefit of prophylactic antibiotic use in endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery (EETS) for pituitary lesions is controversial. Many surgeons administer antibiotics perioperatively not based on clear guidelines but to he safe. The purpose of this study was to determine if antibiotic prophylaxis use reduces the risk of infection (e.g., meningitis, sinusitis) within 30 days after the surgery in adult patients with pituitary lesions undergoing EETS.
   METHODS: A systematic review was performed to assess the effectiveness of perioperative antibiotic use in preventing infectious complications in patients undergoing EETS. Data sources included Ovid Databases, Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Grey Literature. The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, observational studies, and case series of prophylactic antibiotic perioperative use for EETS. The study end points were the rates of meningitis and sinusitis as infectious complications after EETS.
   RESULTS: A total of 282 articles were identified by the initial literature search. Four studies met the inclusion criteria: 3 retrospective cohort and 1 prospective case series studies. All patients included in each study received different antibiotic regimens perioperatively. The quality of studies did not permit performance of a meta-analysis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Even though there are no clear practice guidelines regarding the antibiotic prophylaxis need in EETS, various antibiotic regimens have been used by surgeons. Our systematic review identified a limited number of published studies assessing this question, all observational. Randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic use in patients with pituitary lesions undergoing EETS.

AB BACKGROUND: Extra-axial cavernoma (EAC) at the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) is a rare clinical entity that can mimic radiologically several lesions encountered at this location. We report a case of EAC-CPA and present a review of the literature.
   METHODS: A PubMed research was conducted looking for EAC-CPA lesions described in literature. After reviewing all the relevant articles, the following data were extracted and organized into a single table: patients' symptoms, radiological characteristics, surgical procedure, histopathology, and outcome.
   RESULTS: Eighteen cases (including ours) were identified from these reports. Mean age at diagnosis was 42 with a male:female ratio of 2.6:1. The most commonly involved cranial nerves were the vestibulocochlear complex followed by the trigeminal nerve. The lesions were iso-to hypodense on computed tomography. On magnetic resonance imaging, the EAC-CPA can be solid or cystic. All lesions were approached using retrosigmoid craniotomies. Histologically, both intra- and extra-axial cavernomas are identical, consisting of devoid vascular sinusoids with endothelial lining. The outcome was favorable in 16/18 of the described cases. One case presented a worsened facial paresis and 1 patient died from excessive intraoperative bleeding and subsequent complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that EAC-CPA are rarely encountered, it should be kept in mind in the list of differential diagnosis, preparing both the surgeon and anesthesiologist for the surgery of a vascular lesion. Specific radiological features, especially an associated developmental venous anomaly could point to the diagnosis.

DE DIC; Intracranial hemorrhage; LIC; Multiple; Venous malformation
AB BACKGROUND: Venous malformations are classified as slow-flow vascular malformations. Coagulation abnormalities are known to be frequent among patients with venous malformations. We report a case of repeated intracranial hemorrhage after delivery, induced by coagulopathy associated with multiple venous malformations.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 28-year-old woman presented with left chronic subdural hematoma 1 month after successfully giving birth. She had a history of multiple venous malformations around the pubic region and hips. The hematoma was evacuated by burr hole surgery. Three hours later, her level of consciousness rapidly deteriorated and computed tomography showed acute epidural hematoma. The hematoma was removed immediately by craniotomy under general anesthesia. No bleeding points were apparent in the operative field. Continuous bleeding around the dura mater and subdural space were encountered, and hemostasis was not achieved by electrocoagulation. After using fresh frozen plasma, hemostasis was achieved. Level of consciousness and neurologic symptoms improved postoperatively. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple venous malformations in bilateral lower extremities and the pelvis. Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy was diagnosed, and thrombo modulin and blood coagulation factor XIII were administered. She was discharged home without any neurologic deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: The delivery activated localized intravascular coagulopathy in the venous malformations and induced chronic subdural hematoma. Surgical interventions then resulted in progression of the coagulopathy to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, inducing acute epidural hematoma.

   Note
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Laminoplasty; Spinal cord neoplasm; Thoracolumbar spine
ID CERVICAL LAMINECTOMY; LUMBAR; RECONSTRUCTION; SPINE
AB BACKGROUND: Various methods such as laminectomy, laminoplasty, and/or laminotomy can be used to remove intraspinal lesions. However, laminoplasty has generally been known to be able to prevent postoperative instability and deformity and avoid local scarring at operative site. We have described a new laminoplasty technique that can preserve the interspinous ligament during thoracolumbar intraspinal surgery.
   METHODS: Ten patients undergoing laminoplastic tumor excision were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively with neurologic examinations, a pain visual analog scale, and the Oswestry Disability Index. Instability and fusion were evaluated with plain radiography and computed tomography. The operative time, complications, and hospital stay were also assessed.
   RESULTS: We assessed the data from 10 patients (12 disc levels with intradural extramedullary tumor who had undergone a ligament-saving laminoplasty procedure. Of the 10 tumors, 6 were schwannoma, 2 were meningioma, 1 was extra-adrenal paraganglioma, and 1 was metastatic adenocarcinoma. Spinal computed tomography was performed 6 months postoperatively. Complete union of the laminoplasty site was achieved for all 10 patients. The flexion-extension view of the plain radiograph was compared with the preoperative images to evaluate the stability of the operated level. No patient had range of motion limitation or instability.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ligament-saving laminoplasty can provide an appropriate surgical view and allow for anatomical reconstruction of the spinal posterior element after excision of spinal cord tumors. This procedure might offer an alternative to classic techniques for selected patients to preserve spinal biomechanical function.

SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Review
DE Bypass; Embolization; Posterior inferior cerebellar artery; Vertebral
   artery dissecting aneurysms
ID SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE
AB BACKGROUND: Ruptured vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms (VADAs) involving the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) are the most difficult to treat among variations of VADAs but require prompt treatment. The major challenge is to preserve the PICA while occluding the aneurysm. Despite advances in the management of ruptured VADAs involving the PICA, each treatment, whether it is combined or not, is associated with a significant degree of risk.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: This study presents 4 cases of ruptured VADAs involving the PICA that were successfully treated using a staged, combined method. Embolization of the rupture point in the acute stage was followed 3-4 weeks later by occlusion of the proximal vertebral artery (VA) and PICA origin after occipital artery-PICA bypass in the chronic stage.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although it is sometimes very difficult to determine the exact rupture point of VADAs, ruptures tend to occur at distal segments of a dissecting aneurysm presenting as bleb. Also, when planning a trapping of the VA, careful examination of angiography is needed to assess the contralateral VA and rupture point. Our staged and combined strategy may provide another valuable treatment option for treating VADAs involving the PICA with special emphasis on the safety and efficacy in our method.

   resection; Surgical seeding
ID SURGICAL PATHWAY
AB BACKGROUND: Scalp metastases from anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO) are extremely rare and mostly involve intracranial recurrence or widely metastatic disease. Here we describe an exceptional case of histopathologically proven scalp metastasis of AO 6 years after surgical resection and postoperative adjuvant radiation.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 42-year-old woman presented with several months of progressive headache and dizziness. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an irregular enhancing lesion in the left frontal lobe extending to the ependymal surface. Left frontal craniotomy was performed through a corona! approach, and gross total resection was achieved. Pathologic examination confirmed a World Health Organization grade III AO. The patient subsequently received 60 Gy of external beam radiotherapy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks. During 8 years of follow-up, the patient remained symptom free, and no evidence of intracranial recurrence was found. However, 6 years after intracranial tumor resection, the patient noticed a subcutaneous mass in her right frontal scalp, which was the site contralateral to her craniotomy. MRI revealed a homogeneously marked enhancing nodular lesion in the subcutaneous tissue of the right frontal scalp without intracranial recurrence. Gross total resection was performed, and the pathologic findings, which identified the mass as an AO, were consistent with those of the primary left frontal tumor.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a rare case of long-term AO scalp metastasis without intracranial recurrence. lntraoperative seeding and longer survival for oligodendroglial tumors may cause this rare entity. Optimal surgical strategies and standard operative procedures can promote the prevention of iatrogenic seeding.

TI Neurogenic Bladder Dysfunction as Signal of Late Failure of Endoscopic
   Third Ventriculostomy in Child with Spina Bifida
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Long-term outcome; Neurogenic bladder; Pediatric hydrocephalus; Third
   ventriculostomy
ID HYDROCEPHALUS; MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an option for hydrocephalus treatment in patients with myelomeningocele, mostly after a previous shunt dysfunction. Late failure of ETV is a rare event, traditionally associated with dramatic symptoms of intracranial hypertension. In patients with myelodysplasia and neurogenic bladder dysfunction, urodynamic deterioration can be a signal of neurologic worsening as a consequence of tethered cord or shunt problems.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe here a rare case of a 12-year-old female patient with myelomeningocele and evidence of a failure 10 years after a previously successful ETV whose initial symptoms were worsening of urinary complaints. After 2 months, she was admitted to the emergency department with seizures and acute hydrocephalus and was shunted.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric neurosurgeons must follow myelomeningocele patients with successful ETV for a long time and take care of subtle alterations of organic functions that have a close relationship with central nervous system integrity. A multidisciplinary approach can facilitate this strategy and avoid a tragic outcome.

TI Hormonal Fertility Therapy as Potential Risk Factor for Cerebrospinal
   Fluid Leak After Endoscopic Endonasal Surgery: Case Study and Literature
   Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE CSF leak; Endonasal endoscopic approach; Intracranial hypertension;
   Leuprolide
ID IDIOPATHIC INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION; SKULL-BASE RECONSTRUCTION; MODEL
AB BACKGROUND: Endoscopic endonasal approaches have been shown to be as effective as transcranial approaches for sinonasal malignancies involving the skull base. Although they are associated with less risk than an open cranial resection, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks remain a main concern. Some drugs can raise the intracranial pressure and exacerbate the risk of a postoperative CSF leak. In this case report, we present a 32-year-old woman who was treated via endoscopic endonasal approach for an olfactory neuroblastoma and later underwent fertility preservation treatment with leuprolide, which likely led to a delayed CSF leak.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 32-year-old woman diagnosed with a large invasive olfactory neuroblastoma underwent resection via an endonasal transcribriform approach and repair of skull base defect using a pericranial flap. Forty-seven days post operation the patient returned, presenting with a clear nasal discharge. Magnetic resonance imaging raised concern for focal flap necrosis, while computed tomography cisternogram revealed a defect in the pericranial flap. The defect was debrided and repaired; a postoperative lumbar drain was placed and showed an opening pressure of 26 cm of water. Discussion with the patient revealed that she received fertility preservation treatment with leuprolide followed by oocyte retrieval 32 days before presentation of her delayed CSF leak.
   CONCLUSIONS: Leuprolide or any drug that can potentially increase intracranial pressure should be held for 3 months after surgery or until after a skull base defect has fully healed.

   EXPERIENCE; OCCLUSION; VISION
AB BACKGROUND: To systematically assess the efficacy and safety between flow diversion and coiling for patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms.
   METHODS: Potential academic articles were identified from Cochrane Library, Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, and other databases. The time range we retrieved from was the inception of electronic databases to February 2019. Gray studies were identified from the references of included literature reports. STATA version 11.0 was used to analyze the pooled data.
   RESULTS: A total of 11 articles (10 retrospective studies and 1 prospective study) were involved in our study. The overall participants of the coiling group were 611, whereas 576 were in the flow diversion group. Our meta-analysis showed that flow diversion was preferable for unruptured intracranial aneurysms as its lower value of total cost per case (weighted mean difference, 5705.906; 95% confidence interval [CI], [4938.536, 6473236]; P < 0.001), fluoroscopy time per case (weighted mean difference, 25.786; 95% CI, 17.169-34.377; P < 0.001), and retreatment rates (odds ratio [OR], 7.127; 95% CI, [3.525, 14.410]; P < 0.001), at the same time, a higher rate of immediate completed occlusion (OR, 0.390; 95% CI, [0.224, 0.680]; P = 0.001) and follow-up completed occlusion (OR, 0.173; 95% CI, [0.080, 0.375]; P < 0.001) was demonstrated in the flow diversion group. There was no difference on intraoperative complication rates (P = 0.070), procedure-related mortality (P = 0.609) and rupture rates (P = 0.408), modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-2 at discharge (P = 0.077), and mRS 0-2 at follow-up (P = 0.484).
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of flow diversion for the treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms may reduce total cost per case, fluoroscopy time per case, retreatment rates, and increases immediate completed occlusion and follow-up completed occlusion rates without affecting the results of mRS and intraoperative complication.

DE Clipping; Kinked; Perforator
ID MIDDLE CEREBRAL-ARTERY
AB BACKGROUND: Adverse outcomes after aneurysm clipping can be potentially reversible, when managed appropriately.
   METHODS: This is a case report describing kinking of a perfactor due to clipping of parent vessel aneurysm.
   RESULTS: Complete recovery of a high-grade motor deficit was achieved after instant reintervention with application of smaller clips in combination with gelfoam soaked in papaverine.
   CONCLUSION: Use of evoked potentials and intraoperative digital subtraction angiography are recommended and may help in preclinical diagnosis. Knowledge of delayed perforator kinking as a complication may lead to a more rapid diagnosis and management.

AB With the increasing interest in big data and health services research, use of administrative databases is becoming commonplace in health care studies, including in neurosurgery. Administrative data offer the unique advantage of accessing large amounts of information previously collected from a population-based sample with geographic diversity. When using administrative data sets, researchers can benefit from application of risk adjustment instruments, which help stratify patients and tailor the original sample for specific research questions. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index are 2 of the most common indices. The Pediatric Medical Complexity Algorithm and Clinical Classification Software are other promising tools. Understanding of these tools may assist neurosurgeons who wish to critically assess research findings relevant to their clinical practice. In this review, an overview is presented of risk adjustment tools commonly used in adult as well as pediatric populations and their history, uses, limitations, and applications in neurosurgical research are summarized.

TI Cystic Degeneration of Cerebellar Tonsil 1 Year After Chiari I
   Malformation Surgery. A Case Report and Review of the Literature
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Cerebellar tonsil; Chiari I malformation surgery
ID SYRINGOMYELIA; ASSOCIATION; CORD
AB BACKGROUND: Chiari malformation results from a bony structural anomaly of the skull base. The structural defect causes downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum. The herniated tonsils block the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid, which causes a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms.
   CASE REPORT: In May 2015, a 16-year-old girl was referred to our center because of a 1-year history of occipital headache, most often triggered by exercise and physical activity at school. She had experienced new-onset numbness in both hands, more severe on the right side, associated with some degrees of weakness. Eventually, an evaluation of her condition included magnetic resonance imaging in T1 and T2 sequences, which revealed a 20-mm downward migration of the cerebellar tonsils, associated with a cervical cord syrinx at the level of the fourth and fifth cervical vertebrae. The patient underwent posterior fossa decompression and C1 and partial C2 laminectomies. Postoperatively there were no complications, and the patient was discharged on day 3. Postoperatively, she experienced some improvement in her symptoms. After 2 months of routine outpatient follow-up, she was better, the headaches had subsided, she could resume some activities, and there was no paresis in her limbs.
   CONCLUSIONS: In cases of progressive symptoms of Chiari malformation, decompression is important and should be considered after shunt insertion to the hindbrain.

ID DURAL RECONSTRUCTION; SURGERY; FASCIA; BONE; MALIGNANCIES; OUTCOMES;

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe a novel bilaterally pedicled pericranial flap for anterior cranial base reconstruction after removal of complex frontobasal cancers extending to the frontal region, thus precluding the use of standard reconstructive techniques.
   METHODS: In selected oncologic cranial base surgeries,the use of the standard galea frontalis pericranial flap for reconstructive purposes may be precluded by tumor infiltration. In such cases, dura mater reconstruction and exclusion of frontal sinuses from the intracranial space can be performed using a large superficial temporal artery bilaterally pedicled pericranial flap obtained from both temporoparietal regions. Surgical technique, indication, contraindication, complications, and degree of resection are recorded to evaluate the efficacy of this surgical method.
   RESULTS: A 48-year-old man affected by a recurrence of frontbasal squamous cell carcinoma was surgically treated by combined transcranial and endoscopic endo-nasal resection. A large pericranial flap pedicled bilaterally on the parietal branches of the superficial temporal artery was obtained, transposed anteriorly, carefully watertight sutured to the dural defect, and used to exclude cranialized frontal sinuses as well. The reconstruction was successful, and the patient was discharged home on the tenth postoperative day without any complications and/or development of cerebrospinal fluid leak. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging 3 months after surgery was clear from disease with consolidated surgical outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: This novel pericranial flap seems to be easily obtained and effective for anterior cranial base reconstruction when the use of a traditional galea frontalis flap is precluded for oncologic reasons and there are concerns for the possible development of contaminations and cerebrospinal fluid leaks.

AB BACKGROUND: Suprasellar epidermoid cysts (SECs) constitute a large portion of so-called pearly tumors. Despite their insidious development and infiltration into vital neurovascular structures, they have a friable consistency, which particularly facilitates their resection; the only alternative to surgery is wait-and-see policy. We present a case of SEC in a patient with bitemporal hemianopia and no other significant symptoms and results of analysis of data on surgical treatment of 71 similar cases reported in the last 4 decades.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 29-year-old man presented with 1 year blurred vision. Bitemporal hemianopia was detected by perimetry. The patient was otherwise fit and well, with no significant past medical history. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an extra-axial suprasellar lesion with expansion toward the prepontine cistern, which showed restricted diffusion. The patient was operated on via a binostril endoscopic transtuberculum-transplanum endonasal approach. Pathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of epidermoid cyst. The postoperative course was complicated by third cranial nerve palsy, rhinorrhea, which required reoperation, and diabetes insipidus. Otherwise, the patient made a good recovery and reported subjective improvement of visual acuity. Gradually, the left third cranial nerve function improved and there was neither any long-term complication nor recurrence on 6 months follow-up study.
   CONCLUSIONS: A suprasellar location frequently impedes the gross total resection of epidermoid cysts. Endoscopic endonasal approaches might be more effective in resection of lesions that do not extend laterally beyond the cranial nerves. The introduction of magnetic resonance imaging and surgical endoscopy were fundamental achievements in SEC management. There is a constant need for quality case reports on the management of these intracranial tumors.

It is most frequently observed in children and develops in midline structures, including the brainstem, thalamus, and spine. We describe a rare diffuse midline glioma with an H3 K27M mutation arising in the hypothalamus of an adult.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 27-year-old woman was admitted to our department complaining of amenorrhea, polydipsia, and diuresis for the previous 3 months, and headache and lethargy for approximately 10 days. Computed tomography scan showed an oval isodense solid mass extending from the pituitary toward the suprasellar cistern. A gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a strongly heterogeneous enhanced solid lesion and nonenhanced cystic lesion. The patient underwent surgery and chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide. Histologic and immunohistochemical analyses revealed H3 K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma. The patient underwent another resection for a recurrent tumor 5 months after the first surgery. Three months after the second operation, the patient relapsed, with MRI revealing spinal cord and meningeal metastases; she died shortly afterward.
   CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse midline glioma with an H3 K27M mutation occurring in the hypothalamus of an adult is rare but should be considered in differential diagnoses. Because histone H3 K27M mutations are associated with aggressive clinical behavior and poor prognosis, molecular analyses should be used to determine the clinical and histopathologic features of such tumors. This will contribute to developing targeted drugs and gene therapy going forward.

AB Cerebral revascularization is used in the treatment of complex aneurysms and acute and chronic cerebral occlusive disease. Although superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery remains the workhorse of extracranial-intracranial bypass, several approaches have been developed during the past half century. The maxillary artery has shown feasibility in cadaveric studies, and usefulness in living patients, for achieving successful surgical revascularization. Although technically challenging and unfamiliar, maxillary-intracranial bypass offers the advantages of higher flow, good caliber matching, shorter graft length, calvarial protection of the interposition graft, and versatility for revascularizing multiple intracranial targets, including the intracranial internal carotid, proximal and middle cerebral, posterior cerebral, and superior cerebellar arteries. We discuss and review the evolution of, operative approaches for, and clinical applications of maxillary artery to intracranial bypass.

ID SKULL BASE METASTASIS
AB BACKGROUND: The trigeminal ganglion is an atypical site for metastasis, especially for renal clear cell carcinoma.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report 2 clinical cases of a 66-year-old man and a 58-year-old man with trigeminal symptoms. Both patients had a history of renal clear cell (RCC) that was considered to be cured at 6 and 9 years, respectively. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a trigeminal ganglion lesion with increased gadolinium enhancement associated with petrous apex erosion. The main diagnostic hypothesis based on MRI was trigeminal schwannoma for both patients. One patient underwent subtotal removal, the other a biopsy. Histologic examinations resulted in the diagnosis of RCC metastasis. Body computed tomography revealed pancreatic metastasis for both but no renal recurrence. The patients were treated by local radiotherapy, and 1 of the patients had associated chemotherapy. We added to these clinical cases a literature review of skull base metastasis of RCC.
   Trigeminal ganglion metastasis of RCC is very rare and can persist until 10 years after the first RCC diagnosis. It seems that the best treatment is surgical removal. To date, the role of local radiotherapy is not demonstrated, and the prognosis seems to be poor.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the case of trigeminal symptoms, rapid tumoral growth on brain MRI, or a history of RCC, we think that a body computed tomography should be performed, and surgery should be considered.

   RESECTION
AB BACKGROUND: Preoperative embolization is often considered mandatory in highly vascularized brain tumors to contain blood loss. However, not all lesions are amenable to endovascular preoperative embolization. In the literature, cases of preoperative and intraoperative embolization are described only by arterial catheterization, whereas experiences of tumor embolization through direct puncture of the lesion are anecdotal; furthermore these cases lack an intraoperative control method to assess the effects of the embolizing procedure itself.
   METHODS: We describe the association of contrast enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) and color Doppler ultrasonography (CDUS) to perform intraoperative embolization in an illustrative case of a posterior cranial fossa hemangioblastoma not amenable to a preoperative endovascular procedure. The combination of CEUS and CDUS was tested as an option for the intraoperative devascularization of tumors in which preoperative embolization is considered risky or not possible.
   RESULTS: The association of CEUS and CDUS provided real-time intraoperative data that directly guided the intraoperative embolization and provided reliable data about the hemodynamic effects produced after the direct injection of an embolizing agent. The technique offered a true real-time definition of the anatomic characteristics of the lesion and its relationships with the adjacent structures while distinguishing feeding from draining vessels.
   CONCLUSIONS: This technique has been proved to be a valuable tool in the surgical resection of highly vascularized tumors and in the treatment of intracranial and spinal vascular lesions and can be considered an option in those cases in which preoperative embolization is not possible. It is a feasible, modern, and cost-effective intraoperative imaging technique that allows identification of unexposed anatomic structures, hence minimizing surgical exposition and surgical manipulation.

In some particular cases, trepanation may be associated with other peculiar evidence concerning funerary practices. The aim of this paper is to present the case of a woman from the Recent Bronze Age site of Castello del Tartaro (Verona, Italy), who was buried in a prone position and whose skeletal remains presented evidence of probable frontal trepanation. The association between a deviant burial and trepanation could be of interest in better understanding the history and perception of neurosurgical practices during prehistory.

AB BACKGROUND: Metastatic meningiomas (MMs) are rare (0.1 of 100 cases). Their treatment requires a multimodal approach, with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and radiosurgery, which allows a long-term local control (LC) and an extension of free survival. In this study, the authors performed a review of the literature and reported 2 cases of patients affected by extracranial MMs, with long-term follow-up.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: Case 1: A 48-year-old woman was admitted for resection of an extra-axial falx lesion (meningioma G1). After 2 years, the lesion got a local recurrence, resected with a histologic diagnosis of meningioma G3. During the next 9 years, the patient underwent 5 Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) procedures for local recurrence. At 56 years, she was readmitted for a surgical local recurrence (histologic definition: anaplastic meningioma G3). At the age of 62, the patient underwent a right lobectomy for a lung mass (histologic diagnosis: anaplastic meningioma G3). After that, multiple lesions at soma L5 and adrenal gland were discovered and then monitored. Case 2: A 48-year-old woman was operated for a lesion involving torcular herophili (meningioma G2). After 3 years, a local recurrence requires GKRS combined with tamoxifen. In the next 7 years, she underwent 5 GKRS procedures for local recurrence. The patient also underwent chemotherapy with octreotide. At the age of 61, she discovered multiple lesions in both lungs, liver, and kidney. A hepatic biopsy showed anaplastic meningioma G3. Also this patient does not suffer from any neurologic or clinical deficits.
   CONCLUSIONS: LC in malignant meningioma is achievable through a multimodal approach; GKRS makes possible LC, but a novel aspect of these lesions is opened to discussion: the metastases. These reports show that multimodal treatment for MMs is an effective approach with good LC and improvement of overall survival. However, a long survival may allow systemic diffusion of the disease, in particular, when sagittal sinus is involved.

DT Review
DE Aneurysm; Stem cells; Stroke; Subarachnoid hemorrhage
ID STROKE; TRANSPLANTATION
AB BACKGROUND: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is associated with high mortality (30%-40%) and morbidity with long-term physical, neurologic, and psychological impairments; most patients present with high initial Hunt and Hess grade. In view of the great need for efficacious therapies for high-grade SAH, recent animal studies have demonstrated improved outcomes with administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a potential neuro-regenerative strategy. We present the first case of human intravenous administration of MSCs after aneurysmal SAH.
   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: An 80-year-old man presented with sudden severe headache with nausea and vomiting. Computed tomography demonstrated SAH with hydrocephalus from a ruptured basilar tip aneurysm. Initial examination of the patient showed Hunt and Hess grade 5 and World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade 5. The patient was treated with external ventricular drain placement and coiling of aneurysm. The patient received an infusion of intravenous bone marrow-derived allogeneic MSCs on day 3 post-bleed. The patient made a better recovery than anticipated with a modified Rankin Scale score of 3 at 6 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: Several studies using models of ischemic brain injury have found that administration of MSCs may improve functional neurologic recovery and decrease brain lesion volume. Although there have been limited human studies in patients with stroke, the role of stem cell therapy for aneurysmal SAH remains unclear. This is the first case of use of MSCs in a patient for treatment of aneurysmal SAH. In conjunction with the promising results in animal studies, this encouraging preliminary case report supports the need for additional dinical trials.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) in reducing the blood loss and transfusion volume during open spinal deformity surgery.
   METHODS: A systematic search was conducted for all studies written in English published on or before October 2018 in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library that compared antifibrinolytic agents with placebos for open spinal deformity surgeries. The primary outcomes included the total blood loss, intraoperative, and postoperative blood loss, transfusions volume and complication rate.
   RESULTS: Seven studies that included 525 patients who were diagnosed with spinal deformity. Compared with placebo, the patients who received EACA showed a reduction in the postoperative blood loss (mean difference [MD] -249.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] -375.65 to -123.95; P = 0.0001) and total blood loss (MD -670.30; 95% CI -1142.63 to -197.98; P = 0.005). Furthermore, the patients treated with EACA received approximately 1.67 fewer units of blood (MD -1.67; 95% CI -3.10 to -0.24; P = 0.02). However, in this cohort, no statistically significant differences were observed in the intraoperative blood loss (MD -45219; 95% CI -108221 to 177.83; P = 0.16) and complication rate (odds ratio 0.73; 95% CI 0.16-3.24; P = 0.68).
   CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrated that EACA could he safe and potentially efficacious for reducing blood loss and transfusions volume in patients with spinal deformity surgeries when compared with placebo. In light of the significant heterogeneity, the findings of this meta-analysis should be confirmed in methodologically rigorous and adequately powered clinical trials.

TI Surgical Treatment of Lipomatosis of Nerve: A Systematic Review
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Fibrolipomatous hamartoma; Lipofibromatous hamartoma; Lipomatosis of
   nerve; Macrodactyly; Overgrowth
ID MEDIAN NERVE; LIPOFIBROMATOUS HAMARTOMA
AB BACKGROUND: Lipomatosis of nerve (LN) is one part of the spectrum of adipose lesions of nerve. Nerve-territory overgrowth is present in approximately 62% of cases. Given the wide variability in published reports, there is substantial need to understand the results of surgical treatment and outcomes in this disorder.
   METHODS: Raw data from the published systematic review of LN were used for this analysis. PubMed and Google Scholar databases were also screened for any additional papers. The cases were sorted into 2 groups: (1) definite LN cases and (2) probable LN cases (lacked definite proof of LN diagnosis). For statistical analysis, P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
   RESULTS: The total number of 486 definite and 160 probable LN cases (646 cases combined) was included for analysis. The most commonly performed procedure was nerve decompression in both definite (n = 104; 21.4%) and combined definite and probable LN groups (n = 107; 16.6%). Improvement of symptoms was most often reported after nerve decompression (n = 52). A soft-tissue debulking procedure had the highest association with improvement (odds ratio 144.6, 95% confidence interval: 13.8-1516.2, P <0.001) in the definite LN group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Treatment options for IN ranges widely, although notable consistencies exist. The most conservative procedure involving nerve decompression was the most commonly performed procedure, with reported good outcomes. In contrast, worsening of symptoms was most commonly reported when nerve resection was performed. All treatment modalities were associated with improvement compared with no treatment. Diagnostic biopsy should be avoided.

   SERIES
AB BACKGROUND: Dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) in the anterior cranial fossa constitute approximately 1%-1.5% of intracranial vascular malformations. Depending on the drainage patterns, the diagnosis of ethmoidal DAVFs should prompt treatment because of the high risk of bleeding. Available treatments strategies are surgical treatment and the endovascular approach.
   OBJECTIVE: To compare the surgical treatment with the endovascular therapy in terms of complete obliteration and perioperative adverse events.
   METHODS: This study was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Eligible studies were identified through a search of PubMed and Cochrane until February 2019. A random effects model meta-analysis of odds ratios (OR) was conducted and the I-square was used to assess heterogeneity. Good outcome was defined as no neurologic deterioration within 30 days after the procedure.
   RESULTS: Five studies comprising 81 patients were included in the metaanalysis. Surgical disconnection was superior to endovascular therapy in terms of postprocedural complete obliteration rate (surgery group, 100% [n = 65/65]; endovascular therapy, 47% [n = 15/32]; OR, 32.19; 95% confidence interval, 5.46-189.72; I-2 = 9.9%) and 30-day good outcome (surgery group, 98% [n = 63/64]; endovascular therapy, 47% [n = 15/32]; OR, 21.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.94-247.27; I-2 = 53.6%). No significant differences in terms of 30-day stroke, transient ischemic attack; visual deficit, new-onset seizure, and intracranial hemorrhage were identified.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment was superior to endovascular therapy in terms of complete obliteration and overall good outcome. Adverse event rates were similar between the 2 groups. Future studies should be conducted to validate our results.

TI The Wishbone: A Cranial Midline Localizing Device

DT Article
DE Midline localizing device; Parietal shunt; Posterior shunt; Posterior
   ventriculoperitoneal shunt
ID PLACEMENT
AB OBJECTIVE: The Wishbone device is designed to enable surgeons to quickly and accurately localize the cranial midline. It is intended to be of particular use when localizing the burr hole site during posterior ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) surgery.
   METHODS: The Wishbone is a simple mechanical device with 2 adjustable caliper arms that reversibly attach to a patient's left and right external auditory canals. The Wishbone's laser localizer illuminates the midline scalp. The Wishbone was used to localize the posterior midline in a pilot series of patients undergoing VPS surgery. Midline localization and ventricular catheter placement accuracy were determined using findings from postoperative computed tomography scans.
   RESULTS: The Wishbone is a mechanically robust device and proved easy for surgeons to use. Forty patients underwent VPS surgery using the Wishbone to localize the posterior midline. The localization procedure took less than 3 minutes. The average distance separating the Wishbone-localized midline scalp location and the computed tomography-defined anatomical midline was 2.9 mm (95% confidence interval 1.6-4.1 mm). In all cases, the ventricular catheter entered the ipsilateral lateral ventricle. The catheter tips were placed in the ipsilateral (n = 34) or contralateral (n = 5) frontal horn in all but 1 patient. In 1 patient, the catheter tip entered the parenchyma due to a burr hole localization error in the rostrocaudal dimension, unrelated to the Wishbone.
   CONCLUSIONS: We describe a simple, efficient, and cost-effective system for accurately localizing the posterior cranial midline. A larger patient series is required to definitively compare its clinical utility relative to frameless stereotaxis-based midline localization methods.

ID MALFORMATION
AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are vascular lesions consisting of a pathologic high-flow connection between dural arteries and veins or dural sinuses. Small DAVFs shunts have been demonstrated to exist physiologically, but as their estimated diameter is around 8-12 mu m, they are not visible even on high-quality angiography studies.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report 2 cases of immediate development of a DAVF after embolization with microparticles of the middle meningeal artery for treatment of chronic subdural hematoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: This report represents the first description of sudden development of a DAVF after endovascular embolization of an intracranial artery and may shed light on the pathophysiology and development of DAVFs.

   Tetraplegia
ID GREAT AURICULAR NERVE; RECONSTRUCTION
AB BACKGROUND: Tetraplegia caused by cervical spinal cord injury is devastating for patients and represents a significant public health problem in both developed and developing countries. Improved functional outcomes after nerve transfers are increasingly reported in the literature, but thus far, no options exist for injuries above the C5 level.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the cases of 2 patients with C4 spinal cord injury American Spinal Injury Association A, who underwent successful bilateral spinal accessory nerve transfers, on 1 side to the triceps nerve with long intervening sural graft and on the other side direct transfer to the motor fascicles of the middle trunk. Patients improved from Medical Research Council 0 to 4 on the side of the nerve graft and 0 to 2 or 3 on the side of the direct transfer. Both patients also underwent transfer of the greater auricular nerve to sensory fascicles of the middle trunk, and they experienced sensory recovery in the C6 distribution. Notably, both patients were far removed from the traditional window of nerve transfer surgery at 4 years and almost 11 years out from injury.
   CONCLUSIONS: We describe 2 successful cases of the first and to date only option for motor and sensory reinnervation in high cervical spinal cord injuries. These procedures provide a robust nerve transfer option capable of improving quality of life in tetraplegic patients. There may be a significant undertreated population of patients with cervical spinal cord injury patients in the United States who were previously considered outside the window for benefiting from nerve transfers but who would benefit from these techniques.

ID SPINAL-CORD STIMULATION; REGIONAL PAIN SYNDROME; NEUROMODULATION;
   PREVALENCE; MANAGEMENT; COUNTRIES; TARGET
AB BACKGROUND: Neuromodulation is an evolving therapy for chronic pain. Aiming to meet the limitations of traditional spinal cord stimulation, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation targets pain in a dermatomal distribution at the site of pain transmission. Despite these advantages, lead migration is a significant complication that hinders the long-term efficacy of DRG stimulation. This study aims to identify risk factors for lead migration requiring revision in DRG stimulation.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all subjects who had DRG stimulators implanted at T10-S2 by a single physician over a 2-year period. Their history was reviewed for the following: age, sex, diagnosis, lead placement, reported symptom relief, complications, and postoperative activity.
   RESULTS: In total, 19 cases of DRG stimulator implantation were identified. All patients reported pain relief, with 84.2% (16/19) describing >50% relief. In total, 31.6% of patients (6/19) developed lead migration and 15.8% of total implanted leads (9/57) migrated. Of the migrated leads, 4% (4/9) occurred at S1 and 33.3% (3/9) occurred at L4. The underlying etiology of lead migration was clear and preventable in 66.7% of patients (4/6). All patients who developed lead migration were women.
   CONCLUSIONS: Premature activity, hardware manipulation, and female sex appear to be associated with an increased risk for lead migration. Leads on the S1 and L4 locations may he more likely to migrate. Large trials are necessary to gain a more conclusive understanding of these risk factors for lead migration.

AB OBJECTIVE: Meningeal melanocytomas of the central nervous system are extremely rare, with an incidence of 1 per 10 million individuals. Cases of primary cerebellopontine angle melanocytoma (PCPAM) have only been described in single case reports. The goal of the present study was to analyze the surgical management of PCPAM, with a particular focus on early and late treatment outcomes and recurrence rates.
   METHODS: The patients who had undergone surgery for PCPAM from January 2004 to May 2018 were identified by a local database query. The patients were evaluated for initial symptoms, pre- and postoperative facial and cochlear nerve function, complications, and recurrence rate by reviewing the patient's medical records.
   RESULTS: We identified 4 patients with PCPAM of >1500 cerebellopontine angle lesions ( - 0.2%) that had been surgically treated at our department in the past 14 years. Of the 4 patients, 2 were men and 2 were women, with a mean age of 47 years. Anatomical facial and cochlear nerve preservation was achieved in all 4 patients. One patient experienced a new moderate facial palsy immediately after surgery (House-Brackmann grade III). Of the 4 patients, 3 had undergone radiotherapy and 1 had undergone ion beam therapy for tumor recurrence (6 years after surgery). Of the 4 patients, 3 had presented with tumor recurrence at 2, 3, and 6 years of follow-up respectively. The long-term follow-up examination had not yet been conducted for 1 patient.
   CONCLUSIONS: At long-term follow-up, 3 patients had developed recurrence. Because of the high recurrence rate of PCPAM, we believe that radiotherapy in addition to surgery should be considered in the future to avoid early recurrence.

AB BACKGROUND: After showing the success of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in treating large-vessel occlusion stroke, the target population has been expanded to include patients with smaller and more distal vessels including the M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery. We compared the procedural and clinical outcomes of patients undergoing MT using direct aspiration (ADAPT [A Direct Aspiration at first Pass Technique]) between superior or inferior divisions of M2 and M1.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a database of patients undergoing MT between June 2013 and July 2018 at our center for clinical and procedural variables. Patients with isolated M1 or M2 occlusions were included. M2 occlusions were classified into superior and inferior divisions. Functional outcomes were collected at 90 days.
   RESULTS: A total of 205 patients with M1, 65 with M2 superior division (middle cerebral artery M2 superior segment [M2S]), and 57 with inferior division (middle cerebral artery M2 inferior segment [M2I]) stroke were included. M1 and M2S patients had comparable National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at presentation, but higher than M2I (P < 0.01). Compared with M1, M2 occlusions had longer procedure times and required more aspiration attempts (P < 0.05). M2S thrombectomy had a significantly lower rate of successful recanatization (P < 0.05). Rates of good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) were 46% in M1, 34% in M2S, and 44% in M2I, and postprocedural hemorrhage rates were comparable between groups. On multivariate analysis, M2S occlusion was associated with longer procedure times, lower odds of good outcomes, and lower TICI recanalization scores (P < 0.05) compared with M1.
   CONCLUSIONS: ADAPT is safe and effective in M2 stroke. The procedural success and efficacy of ADAPT in M2 stroke are influenced by the anatomic division with less favorable clinical and technical outcomes in the M2S division.

AB INTRODUCTION: Implant-related infections carry a high morbidity. Infectious rates for neuromodulation implants range from 1% to 9% for deep brain stimulation (DBS), 0% to 10% for spinal cord stimulation (SCS) systems, and 3% to 15% for intrathecal (IT) pump systems. Meanwhile, studies of care bundles report infection rate reduction to 1.0% for SCS and 0.3% for cardiac implants. Herein, we evaluate the effectiveness of an infection prevention bundle (IPB) in minimizing infections after surgeries for neuromodulation implants.
   METHODS: An IPB focused on preoperative checklists, screening questionnaires, methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus decolonization, weight-based antibiotic prophylaxis, strict draping and surgical techniques, and wound care education was implemented in our functional neurosurgery division in April 2015. We retrospectively reviewed all surgeries for implantation or replacement of SCS, DBS, and IT pump system components from March 2013 to October 2017. The patients were divided into pre-IPB and post-IPB groups. All procedures were performed by a single surgeon. Each surgical site was considered a unique surgical case. Infection rates were calculated for pre-IPB and post-IPB groups.
   RESULTS: A total of 688 patients underwent 1161 unique surgical procedures (222 DBS electrodes, 419 IPG, 203 SCS, 317 IT pumps) during the study period. There were 546 pre-IPB and 615 post-IPB surgical procedures. The pre-IPB infection rates were 0%, 1.3%, and 8.7% for SCS, DBS, and IT pumps, respectively. The post-IPB infection rates were 0%, 0.3%, and 1.8% for SCS, DBS, and IT pumps, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a standardized IPB approach reduced the number of infections for all neuromodulation implants studied. This approach can be adopted within any specialty to potentially decrease the incidence of implant-related infections.

AB BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a common type of stroke in young adults and associated with 8% mortality. High intracranial pressure (ICP) and brain herniation are the most common causes of death in these patients. In contrast with malignant arterial middle cerebral infarction, there are few studies reporting the efficacy of decompressive craniectomy (DC) for treatment of high ICP in patients with CVT. In this study, we assess the clinical outcome of patients with CVT with impending brain herniation treated with DC versus medical management.
   METHODS: In this retrospective study, medical records of all patients with CVT admitted to our hospital were reviewed. Patients with the following inclusion criteria were entered into the study: 1) CVT proven by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venogram and/or computed tomography venogram, 2) malignant CVT (impending brain herniation according to imaging and clinical finding), and 3) age between 16 and 80 years. Patients with deep venous system thrombosis, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3, and bilateral nonreactive midposition pupils or mydriasis on admission were excluded. Patients were classified into 2 groups: surgical group (DC group) including patients who received medical treatment and DC and medical group (MG) including patients who received only medical treatment. Outcomes and complications were assessed and compared between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: Of 357 patients with CVT hospitalized in our center, 48 patients entered into the study. Twenty-three patients were managed medically, and 25 patients were managed surgically. There was no significant difference between the groups concerning age, sex, presenting symptoms, transient and permanent risk factors of CVT, GCS score on admission, and pupils' reactivity on admission. All patients in the MG died during hospitalization in comparison with 8 patients in the DC group (100% vs. 32%, P < 0.001). Favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale score 0-2) was achieved in 52% of the DC group and 0% of the MG group (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study confirmed that in contrast with DC, medical treatment could not prevent transtentorial herniation. DC is not only lifesaving for patients with CVT with impending brain herniation but also results in favorable outcome in most patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Approaching the thalamus from any angle remains a challenge because of its deep-seated location and intimate relations with adjacent important neurovascular structures and functions such as relaying sensory and motor signals and cognition. Our aim was to explore the relationship of the white matter tracts of the cerebrum to the thalamus using a fiber dissection technique, to delineate anatomic principles of approaches to the thalamus, and to discuss the tracts at risk in relation to each approach.
   METHODS: The thalamus was subdivided into 6 different regions and 13 approaches were examined in an attempt to describe a surgical road map.
   RESULTS: To reach the anteroinferior, medial, and lateral parts of the thalamus, the anterior and middle group approaches were used, and to reach the posterosuperior and posteroinferior thalamus, posterior and middle group approaches were used. The anteroinferior zone was the most difficult site to be accessed and the posterosuperior thalamus had the maximum number of alternative approaches. The distal transsylvian approach to the posterosuperior thalamus and the supracarotid infrafrontal approach to the anteroinferior thalamus had the highest number of neural structures severed within the surgical corridor. The infratentorial approaches and the suboccipital transtentorial approach preserve most of the white matter tracts en route to the posterosuperior and medial posteroinferior parts of the thalamus.
   CONCLUSIONS: When the surgical approaches for thalamic lesions are defined, white matter tracts along the surgical route should be taken into consideration.

AB OBJECTIVE: The thoracolumbar (TL) area marks the transition of the rigid thoracic spine into the mobile lumbar spine, and it is considered to be the weakest part of the spine. This study was designed to develop a finite element (FE) model of the TL junction (T9-L3) to provide data that could help the clinician and researcher to answer the question of whether short-segment posterior fixation is sufficient for biomechanical performance. In addition, the aim was to examine whether long-segment posterior fixation carries a greater risk of the development of adjacent segment disease.
   METHODS: This was a biomechanical finite element model analysis. FE analysis of the spine was conducted with posterior instrumentation under multidirectional loading conditions in order to evaluate the kinematics of the instrumented lumbar spine, as well as stresses in the posterior spinal instrumentation. We analyzed the following: 1) the range of motion of the T9-L3 region; and 2) the von Mises stress nephograms of the pedicle screws, rods, vertebrae, endplates, and intervertebral discs of 2 fixation FE models.
   RESULTS: Long-segment stabilization was found to be beneficial in terms of reducing total stress on the spine. However, it is possible to reduce the stress on the system by incorporating the spinal fracture into the stabilization system. Therefore, short-segment stabilization is sufficient to create a safe and robust stabilization system and to maintain neighboring intact vertebrae.
   CONCLUSIONS: Short-segment posterior fixation is sufficient to stabilize fractures at the TL junction, where the spinal fracture is included in the stabilization system.

AB BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a life-threatening condition characterized by growing incidence worldwide, particularly in the aging population, in which the primary goal of treatment appears to be avoidance of chronic institutionalization.
   METHODS: To identify independent predictors of 30-day mortality or vegetative state in a geriatric population and calculate an intuitive scoring system, we screened 480 patients after TBI treated at a single department of neurosurgery over a 2-year period. We analyzed data of 214 consecutive patients aged >= 65 years, including demographics, medical history, cause and time of injury, neurologic state, radiologic reports, and laboratory results. A predictive model was developed using logistic regression modeling with a backward stepwise feature selection.
   RESULTS: The median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score on admission was 14 (interquartile range, 12-15), whereas the 30-day mortality or vegetative state rate amounted to 23.4%. Starting with 20 predefined features, the final prediction model highlighted the importance of GCS motor score (odds ratio [OR], 0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.32); presence of comorbid cardiac, pulmonary, or renal dysfunction or malignancy (OR, 2.86; 9 5% CI, 1.08-7.61); platelets <= 100 x 10(9) cella (OR, 13.60; 95% CI, 3.33-55.49); and red blood cell distribution width coefficient of variation .14.5% (OR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.09-7.78). The discovered coefficients were used for nomogram development. It was further simplified to facilitate clinical use. The proposed scoring system, Elderly Traumatic Brain Injury Score (eTBI Score), yielded similar performance metrics.
   CONCLUSIONS: The eTBI Score is the first scoring system designed specifically for older adults. It could constitute a framework for clinical decision-making and serve as an outcome predictor. Its capability to stratify risk provides reliable criteria for assessing efficacy of TBI management.

AB BACKGROUND: Endoscopic endonasal anterior skull base malignant sinonasal tumor resection and reconstruction remains a challenge. We describe our septal flip flap (SFF) reconstruction, a new surgical technique for repairing anterior skull base defects and report our outcomes.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 24 patients who underwent skull base reconstruction using a SFF following endoscopic resection with transnasal craniectomy. We raise the SFF from the contralateral nasal septum based on the septal branches of the anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries; the SFF is then rotated laterally for anterior skull base reconstruction after transnasal resection with craniectomy.
   RESULTS: The SFF was used for multiple tumor types including, most commonly, intestinal-type adenocarcinoma, followed by olfactory neuroblastoma, squamous cell carcinoma, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma, and other types. All of the cases had either preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy. All flaps remained viable postoperatively. Postoperatively, nasal crusting was significantly reduced with faster healing of the surgical cavity.
   CONCLUSIONS: The SFF adds to the clinical armamen-tarium the opportunity to provide vascularized mucosal coverage extending from the frontal recess hack to the planum sphenoidalis. The use of SFF requires careful consideration when dealing with paranasal sinus cancers so as not to infringe oncologic principles.

TI Perspectives on the Earlier Use of Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson
   Disease from a Qualitative Study of US Clinicians
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Deep brain stimulation; Parkinson disease; Perspectives
ID SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; STAGE; NEUROSTIMULATION
AB BACKGROUND: In November 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) "of at least four years duration and with a recent onset of motor complications, or motor complications of longer-standing duration that are not adequately controlled with medication." Although the full implications of this more recent approval are yet to be determined, to date, there are no strict criteria defining appropriate earlier use of DBS. As such, confusion remains regarding the actual meaning of early DBS initiation. To better inform responsive policy, we sought the perspectives of movement disorder neurologists and neurosurgeons regarding the earlier use of DBS. Insights from these clinicians are key to developing appropriate clinical guidelines and determining how early is too early. The objective of this study is to explore attitudes among clinicians toward the earlier use of DBS for PD.
   METHODS: Twelve Michigan-based clinicians were interviewed both about DBS referral/use processes and their perspectives regarding the earlier use of DBS in PD. We used a structured interview with closed- and open-ended questions. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a mixed-method approach.
   RESULTS: We found that most clinicians considered earlier use not solely to be time dependent but instead determined by patient symptoms. Only 16.8% were aware of the FDA's recent indication of early use of DBS, with 25% of our respondents being unsure as to whether it should be seen as an early treatment modality. On average, neurologists suggested DBS as the next treatment option, after medications have been exhausted, typically 6 years after diagnosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: There remain wide variations in terms of clinician's parameters for referrals and timing of DBS. Larger studies are needed to support or refute our findings.

ID MYELOPATHY
AB BACKGROUND: The Hoffmann sign is usually used as an indicator of upper motor neuron lesion, but its clinical effect remains controversial in previous reports.
   METHODS: A retrospective case control study including 107 patients with cervical complaints was carried out. According to the presence of Hoffmann sign, patients were divided into 2 groups. The radiographic results were assessed and the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and false positive and false negative values of Hoffmann sign for cervical pathology, segment, cervical spine canal ratio, and S-index were calculated.
   RESULTS: There were 56 patients in the positive Hoffmann group and 51 patients in negative group. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and false positive and false negative values of Hoffmann sign for cervical pathology were found to be 61.6%, 85.7%, 94.6%, 35.3%, 14.3%, 38.4% and 60.5%, 81.0%, 92.9%, 33.3%, 19.0%, 39.5%, respectively. The ratio of cervical spine canal was lower in the positive Hoffmann group than in control group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the Hoffmann sign is not foolproof in the diagnosis of cervical spinal cord compression, it can be used to assess symptomatic patients. The narrower the cervical spine canal or the higher the cervical segment compression, the higher of the incidence of positive Hoffmann sign.

AB OBJECTIVE: To establish microscope-based augmented reality (AR) support for degenerative spine surgery.
   METHODS: Head-up displays of operating microscopes were used to establish AR in a series of 10 patients. Segmentation of the vertebra and additional target structures, which were visualized by AR, was based on preoperative magnetic resonance and computed tomography (CT) images, that were nonrigidly fused to low-dose intraoperative CT (iCT) data. AR registration was achieved by automatic registration applying iCT and microscope calibration.
   RESULTS: AR support could be smoothly implemented in the surgical workflow. AR allowed to visualize the target structures reliably in the surgical field, facilitating surgical orientation. Flexible placement of the reference array enabled AR implementation for anterior, lateral, posterior median, and posterior paramedian approaches. Identification of bony and artificial landmarks allowed validating registration accuracy; the measured target registration error was 1.11 +/- 0.42 mm (mean +/- standard deviation). The effective dose for registration scanning ranged from 0.52 to 8.71 mSv, which is on average about one-third of a standard diagnostic spine scan. This depended mainly on the scan length (mean scan length cervical/thoracic/lumbar: 99/218/118 mm). Longest scan ranges were in the mid-thoracic region to ensure unambiguous vertebra assignment as prerequisite for reliable nonlinear registration (mean cervical/thoracic/lumbar effective dose: 0.52/614/2.99 mSv).
   CONCLUSIONS: Reliable microscope-based AR support is possible because of automatic registration based on intraoperative imaging. Application of AR in degenerative spine surgery has a big potential; it might be especially helpful in complex anatomical situations and resident education.

AB BACKGROUND: The decision to replace deep brain stimulation (DBS) generators in end-stage Parkinson disease (PD) is based on the patients' clinical status and the risks of this surgery. The infection rates of initial DBS implantation surgery and generator replacement surgery are well established. But the risks of DBS generator replacement for the severely disabled end-stage PD patient have not been described.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all DBS procedures (n = 446) for PD spanning 20 years in a single institution was performed. The focus was on generator replacement procedure performed in end-stage PD. Infections related to DBS surgery were evaluated.
   RESULTS: Perioperative infections (<90 days) after generator replacements occurred in 0.6% of 172 cases and 2.5% of 232 primary lead implantation. Delayed infections (>90 days) occurred in 2.7% of all cases. Generator replacement was performed in 11 end-stage PD patients. None of these patients developed perioperative or delayed infections, and none were readmitted for medical or surgical complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: DBS generator replacement surgery is low risk, even in patients who have end-stage PD.

   neuralgia
ID PAIN; QUALITY
AB OBJECTIVE: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a common cranial nerve disease. Meanwhile, it is suggested in some studies that orofacial pain can also lead to some psychological diseases. Therefore, the current study was carried out aiming to explore the relationship between depression as well as anxiety and TN; at the same time, the effect on the postoperative outcome of microvascular decompression (MVD) would also be explored.
   METHODS: The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores, as well as the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) scores in TN cases were compared with those among patients without TN. Multiple logistic regression models were also used to assess the associations of HDRS and HARS scores with TN. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the MVD outcome in TN patients, and the HDRS and HARS scores were between pain-free patients and those who still suffered from pain.
   RESULTS: The HDRS and HARS scores in TN patients were evidently increased relative to those observed in normal individuals. HDRS and HARS scores were found to be positively associated with the Visual Analog Scale pain score and onset duration in TN patients. Additionally, remarkably higher HDRS and HARS scores were observed in the persistent pain group than in pain-free group.
   CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study reveal that depression and anxiety are closely associated with the incidence of TN, which may also affect the outcome of patients undergoing MVD.

AB BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody debridement and fusion (MiTLIDF) with percutaneous pedicle screw instrumentation (PSI) is a less invasive treatment for lumbar spondylodiscitis.
   METHODS: Patients with single-level lumbar spondylodiscitis were surgically treated by interbody debridement and fusion through an anterior or transforaminal approach combined with open or percutaneous PSI (group A: anterior debridement and interbody fusion with open posterior PSI; group B: transforaminal lumbar interbody debridement and fusion [TLIDF] with open posterior PSI; group C: anterior debridement and interbody fusion with percutaneous PSI; group D: MiTLIDF with percutaneous PSI). Perioperative data, fusion status, infection-free survival, and clinical outcome measurements were compared among the 4 surgical groups.
   RESULTS: A total of 82 patients were included in this study. TLIDF was associated with shorter operative time when compared with the anterior approach (group A: 302.8 +/- 59.9 minutes; group B: 209.2 +/- 31.0 minutes; group C: 260.6 +/- 62.5 minutes; group D: 207.1 +/- 33.6 minutes; P < 0.001). Percutaneous PSI resulted in less intraoperative blood loss (group A: 907.5 +/- 253.7 mL; group B: 859.4 +/- 201.2 mL; group C: 532.9 +/- 193.7 mL; group D: 399.1 +/- 84.3 mL) and reduced immediate postoperative pain (group A: 5.5 +/- 0.9; group B: 4.9 +/- 0.9; group C: 3.9 +/- 0.7; group D: 3.2 +/- 0.7) than open PSI (P< 0.001). There were no significant differences in terms of overall infection-free survival (P = 0.936).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated MiTLIDF with percutaneous PSI is a safe and effective treatment for lumbar spondylodiscitis while incurring no adverse effects in terms of fusion rate, functional recovery, and infection eradication.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in patients with multiple intracranial meningiomas (MIMs).
   METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of 42 consecutive patients (7 men and 35 women) with MIMs who underwent GKRS. The median age of the patients at the time of GKRS was 57.5 years (range, 27-77 years). A total of 115 tumors among 42 patients were identified through imaging or postoperative histopathologic examination, of which 90 were treated with GKRS.
   RESULTS: Follow-up imaging studies were available for 75 tumors in 36 patients (83.3%), with a mean follow-up period of 45.0 months (range, 6.6-90.4 months); 41 patients (97.6`)/0) received clinical follow-up for 16.7 to 106.7 months (average, 57.1 months). Local tumor control was achieved in 68 tumors (90.7%) at the last follow-up. On univariate analysis, surgical resection before GKRS more than once (P = 0.048) and high World Health Organization (WHO) classification (grades II and III) (P = 0.001) were associated with tumor progression. Patients with worsening clinical manifestation showed correlation with peritumor edema (P < 0.001) and had >2 lesions treated by GKRS (P < 0.001) on univariate analysis.
   CONCLUSIONS: GKRS is a safe and effective treatment for MIMs. Variables including surgical resection before GKRS more than once, high grade WHO classification, peritumor edema, and >2 tumors treated by GKRS are predictors of unfavorable outcome after GKRS.

AB OBJECTIVE: To provide anatomic evidence of preoperative assessment of oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) for Chinese patients.
   METHODS: From the hospital picture archiving and communication system, 400 lumbar magnetic resonance imaging studies of adults performed between November 2016 and January 2017 were selected. L2-3, L3-4, L4-5, and L5-S1 transverse and sagittal images were studied, and anatomic parameters associated with OLIF surgery, including bare window and psoas window, were measured and recorded. SPSS software was used for data summarization, sorting, and analysis to explore the significance of various anatomic parameters.
   RESULTS: OLIF surgical corridors to the L2-S1 discs were found in most magnetic resonance imaging scans studied. The size of the psoas affects the difficulty of psoas muscle traction. It is relatively easy to perform OLIF surgery in older women. Most of the human iliac arteries were bifurcated and aggregated in front of the L4-5 intervertebral disc. The lower the aggregate level of the common iliac vein, the less likely it was to have the OLIF surgical corridor in the L5-S1 segment. The most frequently used lengths for a lumbar interbody cage for OLIF for Chinese patients are 50 mm and 55 mm.
   CONCLUSIONS: OLIF can be a good choice for lumbar intervertebral fusion, including L5-S1 segment, in most Chinese patients. Older women are likely to have more scope of OLIF surgery. As a routine preoperative examination, lumbar magnetic resonance imaging is of great importance to OLIF surgery preoperative assessment.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND: Sagittal translations (STs) secondary to osteotomy for the correction of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) kyphosis have drawn great attention, which is considered closely related to neurologic deficits and terrible fusion. Despite being discussed in several cases, there were no relevant reports about the transformation of ST and the spinal canal remodeling in AS patients.
   METHODS: Retrospective analysis was conducted on 16 patients with ST for the treatment of AS kyphosis through pedicle subtraction osteotomy during January 2011 to December 2014 in our hospital. Full-length free-standing spinal radiographs were available for all patients before and after surgery and also at the final follow-up. Radiologic parameters including global kyphosis (GK), thoracolumbar kyphosis (ILK), lumbar lordosis (LL), sagittal vertical axis (SVA), and ST were measured. Rates of ST transformation after the surgery and at 1-year follow-up were compared.
   RESULTS: The average follow-up was 22 months, ranging from 12-36 months. There was no internal fixation failure during this period. The preoperative GK was 59.9 +/- 21.0 degrees, TLK was 38.0 +/- 13.0 degrees, LL was 7.4 +/- 26.5 degrees, and SVA was 27.2 +/- 8.6 mm. The postoperative GK was 15.7 +/- 2.1 degrees, TLK was 5.6 +/- 2.6 degrees, LL was -36.1 +/- 2.9 degrees, and SVA was 6.1 +/- 4.3 mm. ST was 7.1 +/- 2.7 mm after surgery and 1.2 +/- 1.0 mm at 1-year follow-up. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05).
   The rate of ST transformation was 84.9% +/- 9.7%. According to Scoliosis Research Society surveys, the preoperative and the final follow-up satisfaction score was 1.6 +/- 0.3 and 4.7 +/- 0.4 respectively (P < 0.05). Remodeling of the spinal canal happened to all the patients with different degrees.
   CONCLUSIONS: All patients with ST after pedicle subtraction osteotomy for AS kyphosis occurred with spontaneous remodeling of the spinal canal at 1-year follow-up, by which ST can decrease in different degrees or even disappear, and favorable fusion can be achieved even without bone grafting into the osteotomy vertebra.

AB BACKGROUND: The fornix is a region of greatest neurosurgical interest in regards to its complex anatomy and surgical approaches to this area. The objective of this study was to evaluate the morphology of the triangular recess (TR) and its role in the growth pattern of the colloid cysts (CC) within the third ventricle and in the choice of the surgical approach for their removal. Furthermore, to compare the results of the dissections with measurements performed on a magnetic resonance imaging scan.
   METHODS: In the anatomic study, 20 cadaveric specimens were dissected and analyzed. In the radiologic study, a magnetic resonance imaging scan was performed in 20 healthy volunteers. In the clinical study, a retrospective analysis of all the patients affected with CCs micro-surgically removed at our institute between 2010 and 2018 was conducted.
   RESULTS: In the anatomic study, the width, height, and the area of the TR were respectively 0.31 cm, 0.33cm, and 0.051 cm(2). In the radiologic study, 3 different typologies of TR were identified: open recess in ventriculomegaly (7 patients); open recess in physiologic ventricular system (3 patients); closed or blind recess (10 patients). Three different growth patterns of CCs were identified: type 1) CCs localized at the foramen of Monro growing behind the fornix and below the third ventricular roof; type 2) CCs growing rostrally between the column of fornix; and type 3) CCs growing above the plane of the third ventricular roof.
   CONCLUSIONS: The anatomy of the TR influences the growth pattern of CC within the ventricular cavity and determines the surgical strategy for their removal.

   VASCULAR DECOMPRESSION
AB BACKGROUND: Although microvascular decompression (MVD) is a durable treatment for medically refractory trigeminal neuralgia, hemifacial spasm, or glossopharyngeal neuralgia attributable to neurovascular conflict, few national studies have analyzed predictors of postoperative complications.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and risk factors for adverse events after MVD.
   METHODS: Patients who underwent MVD were extracted from the prospectively collected National Surgical Quality Improvement Program registry (2006-2017). Multivariable logistic regression identified predictors of 30-day adverse events and unplanned readmission; multivariable linear regression analyzed predictors of a longer hospital stay.
   RESULTS: Among the 1005 patients evaluated, the mortality was 0.3%, major neurologic complication rate 0.4%, and 2.8% had a nonroutine hospital discharge. Patient age was not a predictor of any adverse events. Statistically significant independent predictors both of any adverse event (9.2%) and of a longer hospitalization were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification III-IV designation and longer operative duration (P <= 0.03) The 30-day readmission rate was 6.8%, and the most common reasons were surgical site infections (22.4%) and cerebrospinal fluid leakage (14.3%). Higher ASA classification, diabetes mellitus, and operative time were predictors of readmission (P< 0.04).
   CONCLUSIONS: In this National Surgical Quality Improvement Program analysis, postoperative morbidity and mortality after MVD was low. Patient age was not a predictor of postoperative complications, whereas higher ASA classification, diabetes mellitus, and longer operative duration were predictive of any adverse event and readmission. ASA classification provided superior risk stratification compared with the total number of patient comorbidities or laboratory values. These data can assist with preoperative patient counseling and risk stratification.

DE Ascending lumbar vein; Iliolumbar vein; Lateral approach to spinal
   surgery; Vascular injury
ID INTERBODY FUSION; ASCENDING LUMBAR; ANTERIOR; COMPLICATIONS; SURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE: Safe surgical approaches to the anterolateral lumbar spine require a good working knowledge of the anatomy and anatomic variations of this region. As the iliolumbar vein is in the vicinity of both oblique and lateral transpsoas approaches to the lower lumbar spine, the following study was performed to better elucidate its anatomy, variations, and position during such surgical procedures.
   METHODS: Fifteen (30 sides) fresh frozen adult cadavers underwent dissection of the iliolumbar vein (ILV). The origin, course, variants, relations, and morphometrics of each vein were documented. Fluoroscopy of the vessels was performed. Lastly, anterior oblique and lateral transpsoas approaches to the lumbar spine were carried out in order to evaluate for potential ILV injury.
   RESULTS: An ILV was found on all but 2 sides (93.3%). It arose as a common trunk from the common iliac vein on 14 sides. Left ILVs tended to have a more distal origin than right ILVs. ILVs had a mean length of 3.7 cm and a mean width of 0.9 cm and were significantly larger on right versus left sides (P < 0.05). Left-sided ILVs tended to have more branches than right-sided veins. The majority of vertical branches of the ILV traveled anterior to the ventral rami of the lumbar spinal nerves, most commonly L4. The ILV and, in particular, its vertical branches coursed next to the L4 and L5 vertebrae.
   CONCLUSIONS: The ILV should be considered during both oblique and lateral transpsoas approaches to the lumbar spine.

AB OBJECTIVE: The management of residual nonfunctional pituitary tumors after surgical resection remains controversial. In this study, we compared the prognosis of postoperative radiation therapy and observation only in patients with residual nonfunctional pituitary adenoma and reviewed the long-term complications after radiation therapy.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 90 patients who underwent surgery for nonfunctional pituitary adenomas from January 2008 to April 2012. Residual tumors were classified by size, location, and pathologic staining. Tumor progression was defined as volume progression >= 15% with or without clinical symptoms. Postoperative radiation therapy was performed <1 year after the last surgery. We compared the progression and 3-year and 5-year progression-free survival between the observation group and postoperative radiation therapy group. Postradiation complications including hypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus, deterioration in visual field or acuity, cranial nerve palsy, and hydrocephalus were also analyzed.
   RESULTS: More of the patients who received postoperative radiation therapy had a tumor progression-free survival of >= 3 years than did those who did not receive postoperative radiation therapy. Postoperative radiation therapy was significantly beneficial for the patients with a tumor size >= 3 cm or with tumors in the cavernous sinus. The most frequent complication after radiation therapy was hypopituitarism and a few cases had third cranial nerve palsy; however, there were no significant relationships with radiation therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this study, immediate radiation therapy after tumor resection was an effective and relatively safe treatment for residual or progressive nonfunctional pituitary adenomas. Moreover, the long-term complications of radiation therapy were mild.

AB BACKGROUND: Ventricular shunting is one of the Primary modalities for addressing hydrocephalus in both children and adults. Despite advances in shunt technology and surgical practices, shunt failure is a persistent challenge for neurosurgeons, and shunt revisions account for a substantial proportion of all shunt-related procedures. There are a wealth of studies elucidating failure patterns and patient demographics in pediatric cohorts; however, data in adults are less uniform. We sought to determine the rates of all-cause and shunt failure readmission in adults who underwent the insertion of a ventricular shunt.
   METHODS: We queried the Nationwide Readmissions Database from 2010 to 2014 to evaluate new ventricular shunts placed in adults with hydrocephalus. We sought to determine the rates of all-cause and shunt revision-related readmissions and to characterize factors associated with readmissions. We analyzed predictors including patient demographics, hospital characteristics, shunt type, and hydrocephalus cause.
   RESULTS: Analysis included 24,492 initial admissions for shunt placement in patients with hydrocephalus. Of patients, 9.17% required a shunt revision within the first 6 months; half of all revisions occurred within the first 41 days. There were 4044 (16.50%) 30-day and 5758 (28.8%) 90day all-cause readmissions. In multivariable analysis, patients with a ventriculopleural shunt, Medicare insurance, and younger age had increased likelihood for shunt revision. Notable predictors for all-cause readmission were insurance type, length of hospitalization, age, comorbidities, and hydrocephalus cause.
   CONCLUSIONS: Most shunt revisions occurred during the first 2 months. Readmissions occurred frequently. We identified patient factors that were associated with all-cause and shunt failure readmissions.

AB OBJECTIVES: Although a number of studies have implicated ischemia and hypoxia in the pathogenesis of cervical spondylosis, quantification remains difficult and the role of ischemia and hypoxia on disease progression and disease severity in human cervical spondylosis remains largely unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess spinal cord perfusion and oxygenation in human cervical spondylosis and examine the relationship between perfusion, degree of spinal cord compression, and neurological status.
   METHODS: Twenty-two patients with cervical spondylosis with or without myelopathy received a dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI exam consisting of a novel spin-andgradient echo echoplanar acquisition before, during, and following gadolinium-based contrast injection. Estimation of relative spinal cord blood volume (rSCBV), the reversible relaxation rate (R-2(sic)), and relative oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF = R-2(sic)/rSCBV) was performed at the site of compression and compared with anterior-posterior spinal cord diameter and modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score, a measure of neurological impairment.
   RESULTS: rSCBV was linearly correlated with both anterior-posterior cord diameter (R-2 = 0.4667, P = 0.0005) and mJOA (R-2 = 0.2274, P = 0.0248). R-2(sic) was linearly correlated with mJOA (R-2 = 0.3998, P = 0.0016) but not cord diameter (R-2 = 0.055; P = 0.2950). Also, rOEF was correlated with both cord diameter (R-2 = 0.3440, P = 0.0041) and mJOA (R-2 = 0.4699, P = 0.0004).
   CONCLUSIONS: Results support the hypothesis that spinal cord compression results in ischemia and hypoxia, and the degree of ischemia and hypoxia is proportional to the degree of neurological impairment.

AB OBJECTIVE: The widespread over-use of narcotics has been increasing. However, whether narcotic use impacts surgical outcomes after complex spinal fusion remains understudied. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether there is an association between preoperative narcotic use with perioperative complication rates, patient-reported pain scores, and ambulatory status after complex spinal fusions.
   METHODS: The medical records of 134 adult (age >= 18 years) patients with spinal deformity undergoing elective, primary complex spinal fusion (>= 5 levels) for deformity correction in a major academic institution from 2005-2015 were reviewed. Patient demographics, comorbidities, intra-operative and postoperative complication rates, pain scores, and ambulatory status were collected for each patient.
   RESULTS: Patient demographics and comorbidities were similar between both cohorts, except that the Narcotic-User cohort had a greater mean age (57.5 years vs. 50.7 years; P = 0.045) and prevalence of depression (39.4% vs. 16.2%; P = 0.003). Complication rates were similar between both cohorts. The Narcotic-User cohort had significantly higher pain scores at baseline (6.7 +/- 2.4 vs. 4.0 +/- 3.4; P < 0.001) and at the first postoperative pain score reported (6.7 +/- 2.8 vs. 5.3 +/- 2.9; P = 0.013), but had a significantly greater improvement from baseline to last pain score (Narcotic-User: -2.5 +/- 3.9 vs. Non-User: -0.5 +/- 4.7; P = 0.031). The Narcotic-User cohort had significantly greater ambulation on the first postoperative ambulatory day compared with the Non-User cohort (103.8 +/- 144.4 vs. 56.4 +/- 84.0; P = 0.031).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the preoperative use of narcotics may impact patient perception of pain and improvement after complex spinal fusions (>= 5 levels). Consideration of patients' narcotic status preoperatively may facilitate tailored pain management and physical therapy regimens.

AB BACKGROUND: Various studies have suggested that age >= 80 years is associated with a higher rate of complications after carotid artery stenting (CAS). The Buffalo Risk Assessment Scale (BRASS) predicts complications in symptomatic patients undergoing CAS. Application of the BRASS has shown the ability to improve patient selection. We used the BRASS system to evaluate whether the higher rate of complications associated with CAS in the elderly is related to vascular anatomy.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of CAS was performed at our institution over 7 years. Demographic information, anatomic characteristics, BRASS categorization, and outcome measures were compared between elderly (>= 80 years) and younger patients (<80 years).
   RESULTS: The study included 447 patients: 335 patients (75%) <80 years and 112 patients (25%) >= 80 years. There were significantly more elderly patients in the high-risk BRASS category (P < 0.01), and more young patients in the low-risk BRASS category (P = 0.04). The complication rates in the 2 groups were similar. Older patients were more likely to harbor complex vascular anatomy: they had significantly higher rates of types II and III aortic arches (P = 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively), higher percentage of tortuous carotid vessels (P < 0.01), and higher rates of hostile anatomy for deployment of distal embolic protection devices (P = 0.02).
   CONCLUSIONS: Complex vascular anatomy, rather than age, is the key factor behind the higher CAS-associated complication rate in the elderly. Complications can be avoided through proper patient selection and stratifying patients based on anatomic characteristics, which can be achieved through the BRASS scoring system.

AB BACKGROUND: Variable Moyamoya disease (MMD) genotypes and phenotypes between different races have been suggested previously. This study investigates differences in surgical complications and response to revascularization among Asian patients with MMD compared with other ethnicities in North America .
   METHODS: From a database of 185 patients with moyamoya presenting to our institution between 1994 and 2015, 85 patients with MMD underwent surgery and constituted the study cohort. Baseline characteristics before surgery, procedure-related complications, length of hospital stay, and outcome variables including stroke and functional outcome were compared between Asian and non-Asian patients. Kaplan -Meier survival analyses were used to compare time to ipsilateral stroke and any cerebrovascular event after bypass.
   RESULTS: Our surgical cohort consisted of 27% (23/85) Asian and 73% (62/85) non-Asian patients with MMD with a bimodal age distribution. Among the subset of patients who presented with stroke (n = 55), hemorrhage was significantly more common among Asian patients (P = 0.007). In 120 revascularization procedures, per-operative complication rates were greater among Asian patients while controlling for age, type of surgery, and stroke history (odds ratio 2.94; 95% confidence interval 1.16-7.48; P = 0.02). The mean follow-up time after surgery was 4.57 years. Ipsilateral cerebrovascular event rates were 4.77 per 100 person-years in non-Asian patients and 6.51 per 100 person-years in Asians (P = 0.66). Unfavorable modified Rankin Scale scores (>2) were found in 22% of Asian patients and 8% of non-Asian patients on last follow-up (P = 0.13).
   CONCLUSIONS: Asian patients with MMD may be more susceptible to surgical complications and may differ from other races in their response to revascularization. Further long-term prospective studies are needed to investigate these findings.

AB BACKGROUND: Diagnostic methods of the epileptogenic area continue to be a challenge in epilepsy surgery research. We hypothesized that temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) will result in white matter changes that can be detected using diffusion tensor imaging. Measurement of white matter diffusivity will therefore be useful for presurgical assessment.
   METHODS: Twelve patients with TLE who had undergone temporal lobectomy and amygdalohippocampectomy were included. In 6 patients, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis (m-TLE), whereas the 6 remaining MRI studies were informed without any abnormality (nl-TLE). All had excellent outcomes from surgery. Patients were compared with 12 age and sex-matched controls. Five pairs of white matter fiber tracts were traced, and fiber tract fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were calculated.
   RESULTS: There were several alterations in diffusion parameters in white matter tracts, both ipsilateral and on the contralateral side, these alterations were more pronounced in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the epileptogenic focus. m-TLE patients had more alterations on ipsilateral side than nl-TLE patients, but similar alterations on contralateral side and bilateral fornix. The discriminant function analysis successfully lateralized all the patients with left TLE, 83.3% of the patients with right TLE, and all nl-TLE.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that there are alterations in diffusion parameters in white matter tracts both in m-TLE and nl-TLE patients. Diffusion tensor imaging could be a useful presurgical tool to help establish the laterality of TLE, including patients with "normal" MRI. Further studies with a larger number of patients would be necessary to confirm these results.

ID ANALGESIA; MANAGEMENT; MORPHINE
AB BACKGROUND: Protocols for effective postoperative pain control in patients undergoing spinal surgery are not standardized. In our study, we compared the effects of hemostatic absorbable gelatin sponge impregnated with ropivacaine versus normal saline when applied to the transverse process of the operated vertebrae on the postoperative pain following instrumentation spine surgery.
   METHODS: A prospective double-blind randomized study was conducted on 30 patients undergoing spine surgery. At the end of surgery, the hemostatic gelatin sponge was applied by the surgeon on the transverse process of the operated vertebra containing either ropivacaine 0.5% or normal saline NaCl 0.9. Pain was assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) every 4 hours for 48 hours postoperatively in the 2 groups (ropivacaine vs. normal saline). The total amount of postoperative opioid use was also recorded.
   RESULTS: The VAS score was significantly lower in patients receiving hemostatic gelatin sponge impregnated with local anesthetics as compared with patients receiving gelatin sponge impregnated with normal saline 48 hours postoperatively; the mean total dose of meperidine given in the first 48 hours postoperatively was significantly lower (53.5 +/- 51.0 mg) in patients receiving gelatin sponge impregnated with local anesthetics as compared with patients receiving hemostatic gelatin sponge impregnated with normal saline (140.5 +/- 102 mg).
   CONCLUSIONS: Use of intraoperative hemostatic gelatin sponge impregnated with ropivacaine applied on the transverse process of the operated vertebrae intraoperatively resulted in decreasing the postoperative pain in patients undergoing lumbar instrumentation surgery as manifested by the decrease in the VAS score and the total dose of opioids.

AB OBJECTIVE: Vertebral hemangiomas (VHs) are the most common incidental lesions of vertebral body, but they are very challenging to treat if they become symptomatic. Several treatments have been proposed hut none was superior to others. The aim of this study is to analyze blood loss and long-term clinical and neurological results of aggressive VHs treated with arterial embolization the day before operation, followed by vertebroplasty, posterior decompression, and short segment stabilization.
   METHODS: Ten patients (4 males and 6 females) were treated for aggressive VHs with polyvinyl alcohol microparticles embolization, posterior short segment stabilization, and poly methyl methacrylate. Clinical and neurological outcomes were assessed with visual analog, Nurick, and American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scales.
   RESULTS: At last follow-up mean, visual analog scale was 1.8 +/- 1.3, with a significant difference with preoperative values (P = 0.00018). Neurological deficits persisted in 4 patients (ASIA scale: C in 1 patient [10%], D in 3 patients [30%]), but they improved from baseline in all cases. Also, Nurick scale rating improved in all patients (0 in 3 patients [30%], 1 in 4 patients [40%], 2 in 2 patients [20%], and 3 in the last one [10%]). A statistically significant difference between pre- and postoperative values was observed for both scores (ASIA, P = 0.0102; Nurick, P = 0.026). Relapse of pathology was recorded in 2 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Polyvinyl alcohol microparticles embolization, short segment fixation, and vertebroplasty is an effective treatment option for aggressive VHs, with a fast surgical time, poor blood loss, and improvement of preoperative clinical and neurological outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic literature review is to evaluate recent attempts in creating a standardized multidisciplinary approach combining tumor treatment with current vertebral stabilization techniques for palliative treatment of vertebral metastasis in patients who do not fall into the NOMS (neurologic, oncologic, mechanical, systemic) framework.
   METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search for studies using a tumor modality in conjunction with kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty. In addition, the bibliographies of selected articles were examined for additional studies not viewed in database searches, which led to the use of additional search terms.
   RESULTS: A total of 563 articles were found after our database search. Eighteen studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Articles were then divided into categories based on combinations of tumor modality. Multiple studies reported significant decreases in visual analog scale scores after combined procedures with very low rates of symptomatic complications. Studies that compared their combination with control treatment groups showed greater clinical efficacy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although multidisciplinary management of spinal metastasis using a combination of tumor ablation techniques with vertebral stabilization has been recommended in the previous literature, this review shows that no combination of treatment carried demonstrably different results in pain score reduction, reduced analgesic intake, or improved quality of life. In addition, there is no consensus of standardized variables to evaluate efficacy of treatment, limiting the efficacy of treatment results for the analyzed studies. Although not explicitly included in the initial NOMS framework, our results support the consideration of concomitant percutaneous kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty in these patients on a case-by-case basis.

AB BACKGROUND: Prognostic factors affecting outcome of traumatic brain injury (TBI), despite their importance, are still under discussion. The purpose of this study was to describe risk factors of in-hospital mortality and outcome at 1 year in a homogeneously treated population of patients with moderate/severe TBI.
   METHODS: A total of 193 consecutive patients with moderate or severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score 13-3, including patients with initial GCS score of 13 at high risk for subsequent neurologic deterioration), admitted to the intensive care unit, were retrospectively analyzed. Inhospital mortality and unfavorable outcome at 1 year, based on a Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended score <= 4, were considered as primary and secondary outcomes.
   RESULTS: At 1 year, unfavorable outcome occurred in 47.2%, including an in-hospital mortality of 19.7%. Increasing age, GCS motor score <3, coagulation disorders, and intracranial hypertension were acute risk factors of inhospital mortality. In the 155 remaining survivors, Oxford Handicap Scale (OHS), posttraumatic cerebral infarction, cerebrospinal fluid disturbances, and length of intensive care unit stay were associated with unfavorable outcome at 1 year, in univariate analysis. A cutoff OHS score >= 3 discriminated the probability of an unfavorable outcome (area under the curve, 0.87; P < 0.001; specificity, 74%; sensitivity, 84%). Combining the effect of acute and subacute variables in a multivariate analysis, increasing age and OHS score were independent predictors of outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective study confirmed age as the main acute risk factor and identified OHS as new potential subacute predictor of unfavorable outcome in moderate and severe TBI.

TI The Purely Endoscopic Supracerebellar Infratentorial Approach for
   Resecting Pineal Region Tumors with Preservation of
   Cerebellomesencephalic Vein: Technical Note and Preliminary Clinical
   Outcomes

ID MICROSURGICAL ANATOMY; GALEN
AB BACKGROUND: The cerebellomesencephalic vein (CMV) was frequently sacrificed in surgery approached via the supracerebellar infratentorial (SCIT) route for resecting pineal region tumors, which resulted in potential risk of neurologic deficit. Preserving the CMV in the SCIT approach could enhance the safety and effectiveness of this natural corridor surgery. The aim of this article was to identify the probability and safety of preserving the CMV through the application of neuroendoscopy in the SCIT approach.
   METHODS: Clinical data of patients who underwent pineal region tumor resection through a purely endoscopic SCIT approach were retrospectively analyzed, focusing on surgical techniques and clinical outcomes.
   RESULTS: The study included 8 patients with pineal region tumors. The CMV was preserved intact in all patients. Total tumor removal was achieved in 7 of 8 patients. In 1 patient with 2 tumors in the pineal region and roof of the third ventricle, the tumor in the pineal region was resected completely, followed by subsequent chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy, after which the other tumor disappeared totally. All patients recovered normally with uneventful postoperative outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: The advantage of close observation and panoramic view provided by neuroendoscopy combined with meticulous manipulation improved the ability to preserve the CMV in resecting pineal region tumors via the SCIT approach. The neuroendoscopic technique enhances the safety and efficacy of the SCIT approach.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect and safety of transforaminal percutaneous endoscopic decompression for lower thoracic spinal stenosis.
   METHODS: We reviewed 6 patients receiving transforaminal percutaneous endoscopic thoracic decompression for sympathetic symptoms in the lower extremities. Pre- and postoperative Frankel grade and Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale (JOA) score, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score, and visual analog scale (VAS) scores of back and lower extremities were also evaluated and recorded. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed for statistical analysis.
   RESULTS: All 6 patients completed the follow-up. Mean follow-up was 12.6 months. Frankel grade in all patients improved to normal at the third month after operation. JOA scores significantly increased from 4.4 (range, 3.5-5.0) preoperatively to 5.5 (range, 5.0-6.5) postoperatively, to 6.5 (range, 6.0-7.0) at 3 months, to 6.6 (range, 6.2-7.0) at 6 months, and to 6.6 (range, 6.2-7.1) at 12 months (P < 0.05). ODI scores significantly decreased from 71.2 (range, 6578) preoperatively to 50.2 (range, 45-60) postoperatively, to 30.3 (range, 25-40) at 3 months, to 12.2 (range, 0-20) at 6 months, and to 10.2 (range, 0-15) at 12 months (P < 0.05). VAS back scores decreased from 7.8 (range, 7.0-9.0) preoperatively to 6.9 (range, 6.0-7.5) postoperatively, to 3.3 (range, 3.0-4.0) at 3 months, to 2.3 (range, 2.0-3.0) at 6 months, and to 1.9 (range, 1.5-3.0) at 12 months (P < 0.05). VAS lower extremity scores decreased from 8.7 (range, 8.0-9.0) preoperatively to 3.0 (range, 2.5-3.6) postoperatively, to 1.1 (range, 0.5-1.3) at 3 months, to 0.9 (range, 0.2-1.2) at 6 months, and to 0.3 (range, 0.1-1.0) at 12 months (P < 0.05). Four patients reported excellent results and 2 reported good results at the last follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous endoscopic transforaminal thoracic decompression is effective and safe in settling lower thoracic spinal stenosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Brainstem hemorrhage (BSH) is the most dangerous and devastating subtype of intracerebral hemorrhage and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. However, to date, no effective prevention methods or specific therapies have been available to improve its clinical outcomes. We preliminarily explored the efficacy of deferoxamine (DFO), a clinical chelator known for its iron-scavenging activities, in a rat model of BSH induced with collagenase infusion.
   METHODS: DFO or saline was administrated 6 hours after BSH induction and then every 12 hours for <= 7 days. The survival curve of the rats was created, and the neurological scores were examined on days 1, 3, and 7 after BSH. The rats were sacrificed after 1, 3, and 7 days of DFO treatment for histological examination and immunohistochemistry.
   RESULTS: The results showed that administration of DFO delayed erythrocytes lysis, reduced iron deposition, reduced reactive oxygen species generation, reduced heme oxygenase-1 expression, and alleviated brain injury such as neuron degeneration and myelin sheath injury. However, DFO did not improve the survival rate and neurobehavioral outcomes in this model.
   CONCLUSIONS: Administration of DFO had limited therapeutic effects on collagenase-induced brainstem hemorrhage in rats. Some potential explanations were proposed, and more preclinical work is required to clarify the controversial curative effect of DFO in ICH.

AB OBJECTIVE: We conducted a retrospective analysis to explore the prognostic effect of the cumulative score based on neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and fibrinogen in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
   METHODS: The clinical data of patients with GBM from January 2014 to December 2017 in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. X-tile software was used to identify the optimal cutoff points of NLR and fibrinogen in predicting prognosis of GBM. Fibrinogen-NLR (F-NLR) score was calculated as following: fibrinogen >3.4 g/dL and NLR >4.1 was identified as F-NLR score of 2, only 1 abnormal index was defined as F-NLR score of 1, and no abnormal indices were classified as F-NLR score of 0.
   RESULTS: A total of 187 patients with primary GBM were enrolled in this study. Of these patients, 116 patients were men and 71 were women, and the mean age was 55 +/- 13.55 years. The cutoffs of lymphocyte, NLR, fibrinogen, and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) identified by X-tile were 1.8 x 10(9)/L, 4.1 x 10(9)/L, 3.4 mg/dL, and 228.6. There were 87 patients with F-NLR score of 0, 50 patients with F-NLR score of 1, and 50 patients with F-NLR score of 2. In the univariate survival analysis, age, lymphocyte count, fibrinogen, NLR, PLR, F-NLR score of 2, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy were significant predictors of overall survival (OS) in patients with GBM (all P < 0.05). After excluding related parameters, F-NLR score of 2 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.103; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.401-3.155; P < 0.001) and chemotherapy (HR, 0.650; 95% CI, 0.432-0.977; P = 0.038) were predictive factors of OS for patients with GBM. When stratified by extent of resection, age, and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, F-NLR score maintained the prognostic value in patients with GBM (all P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: F-NLR score of 2 was a risk predictor of prognosis for patients with GBM.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with brain metastasis from melanoma have a dismal prognosis with poor survival time. Gamma Knife (GK) is an effective treatment to control brain metastasis from melanoma. Thymoquinone (TQ) has emerged as a potential therapeutic option due to its antiproliferative effects on various cancers. The purpose of the study was to assess the effect of GK on B16-F10 melanoma cells in vitro and intracerebral melanoma in vivo, and its synergistic effect in combination with TQ.
   METHODS: The effects of GK and combination treatment of GK and TO were studied on B16-F10 melanoma cells by evaluating cytotoxicity with an adenosine triphosphate assay, apoptosis by acridine orange staining, and genotoxicity by comet assay. Western blot analysis was performed to investigate the expression of STAT3, p-STAT3 (Tyr705), JAK2, p-JAK2, caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, survivin, and beta-actin. Expression of inflammatory cytokines was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. GK alone and in combination with TQ was assessed in an established intracerebral melanoma tumor in mice.
   RESULTS: The effects of GK on cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and apoptosis were enhanced by TQ in B16-F10 melanoma cells. GK induced apoptosis through inhibition of p-STAT3 expression, which in turn regulated pro- and antiapoptotic proteins such as caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, and survivin. Adding TQ to GK irradiation further enhanced this apoptotic effect of GK irradiation. GK was shown to reduce the levels of tumor-related inflammatory cytokines in B16-F10 melanoma cells. This effect was more pronounced when TQ was added to GK irradiation. GK with 15 Gy increased the survival of mice with intracerebral melanoma compared with untreated mice. However, despite the additive effect of TQ in addition to GK irradiation on B16-F10 melanoma cells in vitro, TQ did not add any significant survival benefit to GK treatment in mice with intracerebral melanoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that TQ would be a potential therapeutic agent in addition to GK to enhance the antitumor effect of irradiation. Further studies are required to support our findings.

   PREVENTION; HOSPITALS; CSF
AB BACKGROUND: External ventricular drain (EVD) infections are a significant cause of morbidity among neurosurgical patients and have been correlated with increased length of hospital stay and longer requirements for intensive care. To date, no studies have examined the financial impact of EVD infections.
   METHODS: Patients who underwent EVD placement between December 2010 and January 2016 were included in the study. Clinical records were retrospectively reviewed and health care cost data were obtained from the hospital's finance department. Clinical information included patient demographics, details from the hospital course, and outcomes. Total costs, direct/indirect, and fixed/variable costs were analyzed for every patient.
   RESULTS: Over the 5-year study period, 246 EVDs were placed in 243 patients with an overall infection rate of 9.9% (N = 24). The median EVD duration for infected versus noninfected patients was 19 and 9 days, respectively (P< 0.0001). Median length of intensive care unit stay also was increased for patients with EVD infection (30 days vs. 13 days, P < 0.0001). Total health care costs were significantly greater for infected patients (US$ 168,692 vs. US$ 83,919, P< 0.0001). This trend was comparable for all other cost subtypes, including fixed-direct costs, fixed-indirect costs, variable direct costs, and variable-indirect costs.
   CONCLUSIONS: EVD infection has a substantial effect on clinical morbidity and healthcare costs. These results demonstrate the imperative need to improve EVD infection prevention, particularly in the setting of a value-based health care system.

AB BACKGROUND: Clazosentan, an endothelin-1 receptor antagonist, has been shown to prevent the development of large vessel angiographic vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). It has been hypothesized that clazosentan can also reverse established angiographic vasospasm.
   METHODS: The REVERSE (resynchronization reverses remodeling in systolic left ventricular dysfunction) study was a prospective, multicenter, open-label, 2-stage pilot study of adult patients with aSAH who had received intravenous clazosentan (15 mg/hour) after developing moderate-to-severe angiographic vasospasm. The primary efficacy endpoint was the reversal of global cerebral vasospasm in large cerebral artery segments 3 hours after clazosentan initiation. The secondary endpoints included large artery vasospasm reversal at 24 hours and the maximum change in the angiographic cerebral circulation time. The change in vasospasm severity in the proximal and distal segments was investigated in an exploratory analysis.
   RESULTS: The primary efficacy endpoint was met in 3 of 11 evaluable patients (27.3%; 95% confidence interval, 6.0-61.0). However, recruitment was stopped after stage 1 in accordance with the predefined interim analysis criteria. In the exploratory analysis, 50.0% and 77.8% of the patients showed a significant reversal of vasospasm or improvement to the admission :date in >= 2 distal segments at 3 and 24 hours and 28.6% and 77.8% in >= 2 proximal segments, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the main analysis showed a reversal of large vessel vasospasm 3 hours after clazosentan initiation in a few patients, the exploratory analysis indicated a clear pharmacodynamic dilating effect on vasospastic cerebral vessels at 24 hours in most patients, in particular, in the distal arterial beds. This observation supported the inclusion of patients with established vasospasm in the ongoing REACT (prevention and treatment of vasospasm with clazosentan) trial.

AB BACKGROUND: Thirty-day readmissions (30dRAs) and 90-day readmissions (90dRAs) are being increasingly scrutinized as quality metrics for hospital and provider performances. Little information regarding risk factors for 30dRA and 90dRA after elective cerebral aneurysm clipping (CAC) of unruptured cerebral aneurysms is available. We sought to characterize risk factors with a nationally representative administrative database.
   METHODS: The Nationwide Readmissions Database was used to identify patients who underwent elective CAC between 2010 and 2014. The outcomes of interest were unplanned readmissions occurring within 30 or 90 days of discharge. Binary logistic regression was used to identify variables related to patients' demographics, comorbidities, and index hospital admission that were associated with readmission. A Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used to evaluate for changes in annual readmission rates.
   RESULTS: A total of 1123 patients met the inclusion criteria for 30dRA analysis and 946 patients were eligible for 90dRA analysis. The 5-year 30dRA and 90dRA readmission rates were 9.1% and 14.9%, respectively. The annual rate of readmission between 2010 and 2014 did not change. Greater Charlson Comorbidity Index (odds ratio [OR], 2.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-6.28) and nonroutine discharge after the index admission (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.04-3.14) were associated with greater odds of 30dRA. Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR, 3.45; 95% CI, 1.57-7.56) and treatment at a metropolitan teaching hospital (OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.06-4.60) were associated with increased odds of 90dRA. Wound infection was the most common reason for readmission.
   CONCLUSIONS: Readmission rates after elective CAC remained unchanged between 2010 and 2014, suggesting that improved methods for reducing unplanned readmissions after CAC are needed.

AB OBJECTIVE: The economic pressures widely discussed in health care have a large impact on spine practices. This current study is the first to look at characteristics associated with revenues from an outpatient spine clinic.
   METHODS: All clinic visits to spine providers were identified at a single academic institution spanning the dates June 1, 2014, to June 1, 2018. All payment information was calculated using Medicare reimbursement values for Current Procedural Terminology codes. Relevant clinical, surgical, and cost structure data was collected for each patient.
   RESULTS: On average, providers had 21.9 average appointments over the course of 7.6 hours per clinic day. The average ratio of new to follow-up patients was 39.3%, with an average new patient to surgery conversion rate of 15.0%. The adjusted average total procedural revenue per new patient, controlled for scheduled appointment length and actual appointment length, was $686.02. The adjusted average procedural revenue per surgery was $3444.64 and average procedural revenue per hour in spine clinic was $552.40. With a 1% and 5% increase in new patient visits, total procedural revenue increases 2.7% and 13.5%, respectively. With a 1% and 5% increase in conversion rate, total procedural revenue increases 6.7% and 33.3%, respectively. With a decrease in new patient appointment length from 30 minutes to 25 minutes, the opportunity for 1.7 new patient appointments per day was created resulting in a net increase in procedural revenue per clinic day of $837.57.
   CONCLUSIONS: Incremental changes in practice structure can significantly affect procedural revenue. Significant heterogeneity also exists among spine providers.

AB BACKGROUND: Chordoma is a type of rare bone tumor and is a relatively slow-growing, low-grade malignancy that is locally invasive and aggressive. The nomogram is widely used in the field of cancer because it can provide a clear picture for clinicians to predict the survival rate, which can lead more accurate decisions in clinical treatment.
   METHODS: Overall, 875 patients with a primary spinal chordoma were identified and collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry databases (1973-2015). The nomogram was established based on 425 patients with complete data. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of the nomogram were determined by the concordance index (C-index) and calibration curve.
   RESULTS: The statistical nomogram was built on 10 independent prognostic factors: age, sex, race, disease stage, surgery, year of diagnosis, marital status, primary site, radiation, and tumor size, with C-indices of 0.76. The calibration curve to determine the probability of survival showed good agreement between the predictions by the nomogram and actual observation. Tumor diameter >10 cm (hazard ratio [HR] 2.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.77-4.90, P < 0.001), regional invasive (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.16-2.53, P< 0.01), and distant metastasis (HR 3.44, 95% CI 1.98-5.96, P< 0.001) were independent risk factors for poor survival. Undergoing subtotal resection or gross total resection (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.25-0.56, P< 0.001; HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.17-0.41, respectively) and a primary site located in the sacrum/pelvis (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.34-0.78, P < 0.01) were prognostic factors for better survival.
   CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram provided more accurate prognostic predictions for patients with spinal chordoma. Moreover, our study suggests that tumor diameter >5 cm, distant metastasis, and not performing resection are major risk factors that can dramatically decrease the survival time of patients with spinal chordoma.

AB BACKGROUND: In patients with breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM), time between primary tumor diagnosis and appearance of brain metastases varies widely. Despite being a readily available clinical parameter, it remains unclear whether brain metastasis-free interval (BMFI) carries prognostic value among breast cancer patients. The aim of this study was to compare characteristics and overall survival among patients with varying BMFIs and to assess the prognostic role, if any, for BMFI.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 3 institutional databases of adult female patients who were treated for BCBM between 1996 and 2017. Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to determine prognostic value of BMFI for survival.
   RESULTS: A total of 503 patients were included. Median age at first brain metastasis was 52 (interquartile range [IQR]: 45-58) years. Median BMFI was 38 months (IQR: 18-66), and median overall survival was 17 months (IQR: 8-31). In univariate Cox proportional hazards model, younger age at BCBM, estrogen receptor (ER)+ /human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)+ tumor subtype, and the absence of liver or lung metastases were associated with longer survival. BMFI >3 years was not associated with longer survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.13; P = 021). In multivariate analysis, only subtype (ER +/HER2 + vs. ER-/HER2-; HR = 0.77; P = 0.02) and liver metastases (HR = 1.36; P = 0.01) were prognostic for survival. There was no significant association between BMFI and overall survival (HR = 0.99; P = 0.91).
   CONCLUSIONS: In this large, retrospective cohort of breast cancer patients, BMFI was not prognostic for overall survival.

AB BACKGROUND: One third of patients with epilepsy fail to gain optimal control using antiepileptic drugs. New advances in epilepsy surgery have reshaped some diagnostic and therapeutic modalities into less invasive approaches. To understand the cortical epileptogenic net works, stereoelectroencephalography uses depth electrodes as a tool for invasive intracranial monitoring. These electrodes are now being placed using a robot instead of the traditional Talairach stereotactic grid and frame with comparable accuracy and the advantage of shortened surgical time. Whereas accuracy is important for correct cortical sampling and surgical morbidity, the factors that play a role in the deviation of the electrode's trajectory are not yet understood. The aim of this study was to determine if the angle the planned trajectory makes with the skull impacts the final accuracy of placement.
   METHODS: Twenty-five patients with 319 stereotactic trajectories were examined. Skew angle and accuracy measurements were computed based on preoperative and postoperative computed tomography scans fused with trajectories planned using ROSA robot software.
   RESULTS: Trajectories with a planned angle of >30 degrees (oblique group) had significantly higher radial error (2.05 mm vs. 1.45 mm, P < 0.001) than trajectories with planned angles <30 degrees (orthogonal group).
   CONCLUSIONS: The ROSA robotic system is a powerful tool that increases the speed and efficiency of stereotactic neurosurgery. Care should be taken when planning trajectories to avoid high skew angles. If a high skew angle is unavoidable, care should be taken to ensure a larger margin of safety.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess early complications, mortality rate, and cement leakage in elderly patients who had undergone navigation-based pedicle screw placement of the thoracic and lumbar spine.
   METHODS: Eighty-six patients older than 65 years of age who had received cement-augmented pedicle screws for various conditions were retrospectively included between May 2008 and December 2016. Complications, mortality, and cement leakage were determined. All patients had a radiograph as a control. In patients with cement leakage seen on radiographs, a computed tomography scan of the surgical area was also obtained.
   RESULTS: Average age was 73.4 years (range 65-86 years). A total of 319 vertebral bodies with 637 screws were inserted, of which 458 screws were cement-augmented; 348 (76%) of the augmented screws were placed in the lumbar spine and 110 (24%) in the thoracic spine. Cement leakage occurred in 55 of 86 patients, of whom 52 (60%) were asymptomatic. In all cases with cement leakage (asymptomatic or symptomatic), cement could be found in the perivertebral veins: in the inferior vena cava in 25%, in the epidural space in 7%, in the azygos vein in 5%, and in pulmonary arteries in 7%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that the use of cement correlates with a high risk of cement leakage in elderly patients. Using computed tomography navigation for screw placement did not reduce the risk of venous cement leakage, but leakage into the epidural space or through a cortical defect seems to be low.

TI Division of Sacrospinous and Sacrotuberous Ligaments Expands Access
   Through Greater Sciatic Foramen: Anatomic Study with Application to
   Resection of Greater Sciatic Foramen Tumors

   Sacrotuberous ligament; Sciatic nerve
ID DEEP PELVIC ABSCESSES; TRANSGLUTEAL APPROACH; DRAINAGE
AB OBJECTIVE: Tumors of the greater sciatic foramen remain difficult to treat. They often have both intrapelvic and extrapelvic components that may limit visualization and make safe resection of the tumor difficult. Therefore the goal of the present anatomic study was to quantitate how much additional surgical working space could be gained by transection of the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments.
   METHODS: Sixteen sides from 9 fresh-frozen Caucasian cadaveric torsos underwent transgluteal dissection and exposure of the greater sciatic foramen and associated liagments. With the piriformis in place, the vertical and horizontal diameters of the greater sciatic foramen were measured. Next, the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments were cut at their ischial attachments. The vertical diameter of the now confluent greater and lesser sciatic foramina (V-2) was measured.
   RESULTS: The mean vertical diameter of the greater sciatic foramen (V-1) was 54.8 +/- 9.7 mm. The horizontal diameter of the greater sciatic foramen had a mean of 44.3 +/- 6.1 mm with a range of 30-52 mm. After transection of the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments, the vertical distance of the greater and lesser sciatic foramina (V-2) had a mean of 74.8 +/- 6.8 mm with a range of 60.1-90 mm. The mean ratio of V-2 to V-1 was 1.40.
   CONCLUSIONS: The vertical length of the greater sciatic foramen increased, on average, 40% after resection of the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments. The results of this study support an alternative technique for resecting large intrapelvic tumors via a transgluteal approach.

DT Article
DE Anatomy; Low back pain; Lumbar vertebrae; Nerve compression syndrome;
   Pseudosciatica
ID LOW-BACK-PAIN; ENTRAPMENT NEUROPATHY
AB OBJECTIVE: Superior cluneal nerve (SCN) entrapment neuroapathy can result in low back pain and thus be confused with other pathologies (e.g., lumbar disk disease). Therefore we performed cadaveric dissection of the SCN to better understand its anatomy and segmental origin.
   METHODS: Twenty sides from 10 Caucasian fresh frozen cadavers (6 females and 4 males) were used in this study. The diameter of the SCN, distance between the exit point of the SCN from the thoracolumbar fascia and midline, and distance between the exit point of the SCN from the thoracolumbar fascia and the posterior superior iliac spine to the medial and lateral SCN were measured. The segmental origins of the SCNs were verified.
   RESULTS: Seventy-five percent of the dorsal rami of L1, 90% of L2, 95% of L3, 45% of L4, and 10% of L5 contributed to the SCN. The SCN was formed by 3 vertebral levels in 55% and by 4 vertebral levels in 30%. Three SCNs pierced the thoracolumbar fascia in 45%.
   CONCLUSIONS: The origin of the SCN, which has been described in the textbook and literature for a long time, should be reconsidered on the basis of our study results.

AB BACKGROUND: There is a lack of literature guiding treatment of giant cell glioblastoma (gcGBM), a rare subtype of glioblastoma (GBM). We used a national hospital-based registry to explore treatment patterns and outcomes associated with gcGBM.
   METHODS: Adult patients (age >= 18 years) diagnosed with gcGBM or GBM between 2004 and 2014 were identified from the National Cancer Database. chi(2) analysis and Wilcoxon rank sum testing were used to compare characteristics between the gcGBM and GBM cohorts. Kaplan-Meier statistics, univariable and multivariable Cox regression, and propensity score matching were used to evaluate association between patient, tumor and treatment factors, and survival outcomes. Correlation analysis was used to evaluate historical trends in the treatment of gcGBM. Landmark analysis allowed for accounting of immortal time.
   RESULTS: In total, 683 patients with gcGBM were identified. Patients with gcGBM had improved survival compared with patients with GBM (15.5 months from landmark vs. 11.7; P < 0.001). Increased age (P < 0.001) was associated with worse survival whereas being of female sex (P = 0.023) and having a median income >$63,000 (P = 0.004) predisposed patients to improved outcomes. Patients receiving trimodal therapy (biopsy and/or surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) experienced better outcomes compared with those receiving either biopsy and/or surgery only or biopsy and/or surgery and radiotherapy without systemic therapy (median survival, 17.55 months vs. 6.68 months; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: gcGBM has favorable prognosis compared with GBM and should be aggressively managed with trimodal therapy. Prospective studies of gcGBM are warranted to better characterize gcGBM treatment outcomes.

   Prone position; Propensity score-matching; Wilson frame
ID INTRAABDOMINAL PRESSURE; BLOOD-LOSS; COMPLICATIONS; RISK; MORTALITY
AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Increased intra abdominal pressure with prone positioning for spinal surgery is associated with intraoperative hemodynamic alterations and the potential for postoperative complications. This study investigated the incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing spine surgery on a Jackson spinal table or a Wilson frame.
   METHODS: A total of 1374 patients who underwent spine surgery were divided into 2 groups: Jackson spinal table (n= 598) and Wilson frame group (n = 776). After 1:1 propensity score matching, a final analysis was performed on 970 patients. The primary endpoint was a comparison of the incidence of AKI in the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: After propensity score matching analysis, the mean +/- standard deviations of spine surgery invasiveness index were 4.7 +/- 3.5 and 2.1 +/- 1.4 in patients with the Jackson spinal table and the Wilson frame, respectively (P < 0.001). Considering the differences in surgical invasiveness, operative time, estimated blood loss, and administration of packed red blood cells were higher in the Jackson spinal table group than in the Wilson frame group (P < 0.001). However, the incidence of AKI was less with the Jackson spinal table than with the Wilson frame (1.7% vs. 3.7%, 2.25 [0.978-5.175), P = 0.056), not reaching statistical significance.
   CONCLUSION: This analysis showed that postoperative AKI in patients undergoing spine surgery in the prone position was not different with the Wilson frame than in the Jackson spinal table despite higher surgical severity, longer operative times, and more blood loss in the latter group. In spine surgery, the appropriate selection of prone positioning apparatus can potentially be an important consideration in reducing the risk of AKI.

AB BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairments have been reported in patients with pituitary adenomas (PAs). The aim of this research was to demonstrate the effects of hormones and age on cognitive decline in patients with PAs.
   METHODS: A total of 64 patients with PA and 69 healthy control subjects (HCs) were recruited for this study. Both PAs and HCs were divided into a younger group (<50 years of age) and an older group (>= 50 years of age). Neurocognitive domains were assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Chinese Revision (WAIS-RC) and Wechsler Memory Scale-Chinese Revision (WMS-RC) tests. Furthermore, we also investigated the relationship between cognitive domains and tumor volume, and the hormone levels and age of patients with PA.
   RESULTS: Several of the cognitive impairments found on the WAIS-RC and WMS-RC tests were more frequently observed in untreated patients with PA. Importantly, no significant correlations were found between cognitive domains and tumor volume after controlling age, sex, and educational levels. Furthermore, several significant correlations were found between cognitive domains and hormone levels, such as free thyroxine and adrenocorticotropic hormone, after controlling age, sex, and educational levels. Finally, the age of the patients was found to correlate with a decrease in memory after controlling sex and educational levels.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate a significant decline in the cognitive performance of patients with PA prior to medical treatment, especially in older patients, which suggests that hormones and age have the ability to interact and aggravate cognitive decline in patients with PA.

AB OBJECTIVE: The craniocervical junction permits a certain amount of mobility for the cervical spine. The biomechanical properties of occipital bone-atlas joint mainly depend on the bony structure, and atlas-axis joint biomechanical properties mainly depend on ligamentous structure. The underlying etiologic factor of Chiari malformation (CM) is debatable. Nowadays, some researchers argue that stabilization difference is one of the suspicious factors for etiopathogenesis. We aim to analyze the ligamentous morphometric differences of CM.
   METHODS: Magnetic resonance images of 93 adult healthy subjects (n = 93) without any craniocervical junction development abnormalities and 25 (n = 25) adult patients with craniocervical junction development abnormalities (Arnold CM) were evaluated. Length, width, and length-width ratios of ligaments were evaluated.
   RESULTS: Length of transverse ligament (mean: 23 +/- 3.6 [range: 12.1-31.4]) in the normal population was significantly longer than transverse ligament length in CM patients (mean: 21.3 +/- 2.5 [range: 17.2-24.9]). Length of alar ligament (mean: 10.7 +/- 2 [range: 5.1-15.4]) in the normal population was significantly longer than alar ligament length in CM patients (mean: 8.8 +/- 3.8 [range: 1.1-16.6]) (P = 0.007).
   CONCLUSIONS: Craniocervical ligaments play an important role in maintaining stability and motion capacity of this region. This study promoted better understanding of craniocervical junction anomalies and provided data that facilitate performing more precise surgical treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: Perioperative neurologic complication after an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is uncommon but may have significant clinical consequences.
   OBJECTIVE: We aim to estimate the incidence of perioperative neurologic complications, identify their risk factors, and evaluate their impact on morbidity and mortality after ACDF.
   METHODS: ACDF cases (n = 317,789 patients) were extracted from the National Inpatient Sample between 1999 and 2011. Based on their Elixhauser-van Walraven score (VWR), patients were classified as low (VWR < 5), moderate (5-14), or high risk (>14) for surgery. The primary outcome was perioperative neurologic complications. Secondary outcomes included morbidity (hospital length of stay >14 days or discharge disposition to a location other than home) and in-hospital mortality.
   RESULTS: The rate of perioperative neurologic complications, morbidity, and mortality after ACDF was 0.4%, 8.4%, and 0.1%, respectively. Perioperative neurologic complications were highly associated with in-house morbidity (odds ratio [OR], 3.7 [3.1-4.4]) and mortality (OR, 8.0 [4.1-15.5]). The strongest predictors for perioperative neurologic complications were moderate- (OR, 3.1 [2.6-3.7]) and high-risk VWR (OR, 5.4 [3.3-8.9]), postoperative hematoma/seroma formation (OR, 5.4 [3.9-7.4]), and obesity (OR, 1.9 [1.6-2.3]). The rate of perioperative neurologic complications increased from 0.2% to 0.7% from 1999 to 2011, which was temporally associated with the rise in moderate- (P = 0.002) and high-risk patients (P = 0.001) undergoing ACDF.
   CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative neurologic complications are independent predictors of in-hospital morbidity and mortality after ACDF. Both morbidity and perioperative neurologic complications have increased between 1999 and 2011, which may be due, in part, to increasing numbers of moderate- and high-risk patients undergoing ACDF.

AB BACKGROUND: Conventional craniotomy (CC) is generally favored for treating large intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but the feasibility of minimally invasive stereotactic aspiration for large ICH is controversial. We investigated the efficacy and safety of stereotactic aspiration with multicatheter insertion (SAMCI) for large ICH (>= 50 mL).
   METHODS: In January 2014, we implemented SAMCI for large ICH. The inclusion criteria for SAMCI were as follows: 1) spontaneous supratentorial ICH, 2) ICH volume >= 50 mL, 3) Glasgow Coma Scale score >= 5, and 4) no bilateral fixed dilated pupils. Forty-seven patients who underwent SAMCI from January 2014 to July 2018 composed the SAMCI group, and 34 patients who underwent CC between January 2010 and December 2013 and retrospectively met the inclusion criteria for SAMCI composed the control group (CC group).
   RESULTS: The mean preoperative ICH volume in the SAMCI and CC groups was 73.1 +/- 22.8 and 72.4 +/- 21.5 mL, respectively. There were no significant differences between the groups in baseline characteristics except for ICH location. The deep portion of the ICH was higher in the SAMCI group than in the CC group. Postoperative mortality and rebleeding rates were significantly lower in the SAMCI group than in the CC group (4.3% vs. 26.5% and 0% vs. 14.7%, respectively; P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that SAMCI contributed to a decrease in the mortality rate (odds ratio, 0.04; P = 0.008).
   CONCLUSIONS: SAMCI is a feasible therapeutic option for large ICH and has low complication rates.

AB BACKGROUND: Concomitant atherosclerotic stenoses are commonly encountered in emergent large vessel occlusion. This study attempted to prove whether or not the pattern of atherosclerotic stenosis other than symptomatic occlusion is associated with pretreatment collateral status among patients with emergent large vessel occlusion.
   METHODS: The study included 115 patients with middle cerebral artery territory infarct within 6 hours of stroke onset who were considered for endovascular revascularization therapy. All patients underwent pretreatment conventional computed tomography angiography using a 128-detector high-definition computed tomography scanner. Based on maximum intensity projection images, <= 50% filling of the occluded territory was considered to indicate poor collaterals, whereas >50% filling was considered to indicate good collaterals. Finding of >50% stenosis on computed tomography angiography was considered significant, and the stenosis patterns were classified into intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis and extracranial atherosclerotic stenosis according to the location of the stenosis.
   RESULTS: All patients had symptomatic M1 (47.8%), M2 (20.0%), or internal carotid artery (32.2%) occlusion. There were 44 patients with poor collaterals (38.3%) and 71 patients with good collaterals (61.7%). Univariate analysis revealed that poor collateral status was associated with advanced age (>= 65 years), hypertension, high National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, symptomatic internal carotid artery occlusion, and concomitant atherosclerotic stenosis. Multivariate analysis showed that poor collateral circulation was associated with concomitant intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis and symptomatic internal carotid artery occlusion (vs. a more distal occlusion).
   CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis other than symptomatic occlusion might be a crucial factor associated with pretreatment collateral status among patients with emergent large vessel occlusion.

AB BACKGROUND: In patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), brain volume loss can occur in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the hematoma. However, contralateral hemispheric volume change after ICH is not well known. The present study aimed to investigate contralateral brain volume changes in patients with ICH who had not undergone surgery.
   METHODS: Of the 2213 patients with ICH admitted to our hospital between January 2010 and December 2017, 46 patients without surgical intervention were included in the present study. We measured contralateral hemispheric brain volume in the axial images of brain computed tomography at the time of ICH onset and after 12 months. We analyzed the relationship between various factors and volume changes in the contralateral hemisphere.
   RESULTS: The mean change percentage between the initial and follow-up contralateral parenchyma volume was 96.84%. The average volume decreased by 3.16% (P = 0.001). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models revealed no significant factors associated with contralateral brain volume loss. Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test showed no statistical significance (P = 0.824, P = 0.122) between ICH volume groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Contralateral parenchymal volumes were significantly decreased at follow-up brain computed tomography scanning; these changes may provide important clinical information on the remote effect of focal lesion and symptoms in the course of ICH treatment. However, further investigation is required to determine the mechanisms underlying these volume changes.

AB BACKGROUND: Microsurgical management of blood blister aneurysms of the internal carotid artery is challenging because of the special characteristics of these aneurysms. We reviewed our diverse surgical methods with long-term clinical and radiologic follow-up.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients with blood blister aneurysms presenting with subarach-noid hemorrhage that were treated with microsurgical obliteration between 1993 and 2017. Baseline characteristics of patients and aneurysms, surgical methods, and clinical and radiologic outcomes were analyzed.
   RESULTS: This study included 36 patients. The patients were treated using microsurgery with direct clipping (2 patients; 5.6%), cotton-assisted clipping (24 patients; 66.7%), wrapping-clipping (5 patients; 13.9%), or wrapping-clipping with suturing (5 patients; 13.9%). Complete occlusion of aneurysm was achieved in 34 of 36 patients (94.4%). Severe vasospasm developed in 18 of 36 patients (50%). Ischemic events occurred in 8 patients (22.2%), 2 of whom remained with severe disability. Regrowth or recurrence occurred in 1 patient (0.28%), which required additional stent-assisted coil embolization. Mean modified Rankin Scale score was 2.0 (median, 1.0; range, 0-4) at discharge and 1.3 (median, 1.0; range, 0-4) at the last follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Direct clipping is ideal if possible; however, direct clipping is challenging in most blood blister aneurysms. Assisted clipping with cotton is mainly used and could be an effective technique for reinforcement of the friable wall, with good clinical outcomes in our series. Moreover, suturing followed by wrapping-clipping is also useful for managing intraoperative rupture.

AB OBJECTIVE: A new stent-screw - assisted internal fixation (SAIF) minimally invasive cement-augmentation technique has been introduced to treat patients with extreme osteolytic lesions of the vertebral body. The aim of the current finite element study, employing a spine model with an extreme osteolytic defect, was to assess the effect of the SAIF technique in reducing strains in the vertebral body in comparison with a standard surgical short posterior fixation.
   METHODS: Different finite element models of a L1-S1 spine were developed, representing an intact condition (reference configuration), an extreme osteolysis condition, and its treatment, respectively with stand-alone SAIF, SAIF and posterior fixation, and with stand-alone posterior fixation. Each model was loaded to reproduce standing and upper body bending. Principal strains were calculated on the superior endplate, anterior and posterior cortical walls. A paired Wilcoxon test with a 0.05 significance level was performed to statistically analyze the results.
   RESULTS: Median strains on the bony structures increased in the osteolysis model compared with the intact model, and the SAIF technique was effective in reducing such strains under both standing and flexion conditions. Additional posterior fixation, combined with the SAIF technique, produced minimal further reduction of the median strains on the bony structures. Stand-alone posterior fixation only shielded the osteolytic vertebra avoiding excessive displacements but failed in restoring the axial stiffness to values typical of the intact vertebra.
   CONCLUSIONS: The new SAIF technique resulted effective in restoring the load-bearing capacity of the extensively osteolytic vertebra; additional posterior fixation provided only further minor advantages.

AB BACKGROUND: Intracranial meningioma is the most common brain tumor operated in the 2 teaching hospitals in Ethiopia. This study reviews the clinical outcome of intracranial meningiomas in a resource-limited setup.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective study undertaken at 2 neurosurgical teaching hospitals: Black Lion Specialized Hospital and Myungsung Christian Medical Center. It includes all operated patients with intracranial meningioma during the time period January 2009 to December 2013. Patient data regarding sociodemographics, presenting complaint, focal neurologic deficit, preoperative imaging, postoperative neurologic findings, intra-operative findings, and histopathologic results were collected and analyzed.
   RESULTS: A total of 91 patients were enrolled in the study. Tumor size was estimated in 79 cases (86.8%). Fifty-one tumors (64.6%) were >5 cm in diameter, whereas 28 (35.4%) were <= 5 cm. Only 4 patients had tumors <3 cm (5.1%). Tumor size was shown to be related to postoperative functional outcome (P = 0.032). The surgical mortality rate, which was defined as death within 1 month, was 14.3%. Among 88 patients with a postoperative Karnofsky Performance Status Scale score, 43% achieved a postoperative score >= 70.
   CONCLUSIONS: Meningioma size determines the outcome of the patients. It was shown that the functional outcome of patients is encouraging even though further improvement on neurosurgical care is needed.

AB OBJECTIVE: The atrium is the taus common location for masses in the lateral ventricle. However, access to this area is limited owing to its deep location and adjacent eloquent neurovascular structures, such as the choroidal arteries, perisylvian white matter (WM) tracts, and optic radiations. We investigated the feasibility and safety of an endoscopic approach to the atrium via the anterior middle temporal gyrus (MTG).
   METHODS: Radiological assessment of a minimally invasive surgical trajectory to the atrium was achieved in 10 patients. Surgical simulation to assess the feasibility of our endoscopic approach was performed on 24 cadaveric specimens using a transzygomatic corridor and temporal craniotomy. Preoperative computed tomography was performed to confirm the surgical trajectory using neuro-navigation. Using Klinger's method, 5 hemispheres were dissected to assess the relationship of our approach to the WM tracts.
   RESULTS: The optimal entry angle to reach the atrium through the anterior MTG was related to the temporal horn in the axial plane and to the Sylvian fissure in the sagittal plane. Our entry point in the anterior MTG was 19 +/- 1.92 mm from the temporal pole. The transparenchymal distance to atrium was 24.55 +/- 4.3 mm. The WM dissections confirmed that our approach did not violate the optic radiations, uncinate fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, or superior longitudinal fasciculus.
   CONCLUSION: Our findings have confirmed the feasibility of an anterior endoscopic approach to the atrium through the anterior MTG, with preservation of the functional integrity of the eloquent cortex and WM tracts.

AB BACKGROUND: Craniotomies carry inherent risks of postoperative complications that may have a negative impact on patients' status. Recognizing and preventing surgical complications is of paramount importance, especially in meningioma surgery, where most of these tumors are benign and current management protocols are effective in terms of disease control and maintenance of higher quality of life.
   The objective of this study was to describe the early complications after surgery and their predictive factors in patients undergoing resection of intracranial meningiomas.
   METHODS: A partly retrospective, partly prospective review was conducted in a Norwegian population-based cohort of 1469 consecutive cases of meningioma surgery treated at the university hospitals of Oslo, totaling 11,414 patient-years of follow-up.
   RESULTS: 2.6% of patients had a postoperative hematoma, 2.7% a postoperative infection, 3.9% a postoperative worsening of neurologic status; 5.4% of patients died during a 30-day period after surgery. Predictive factors of increased risk of postoperative complications were patient's age for the hematoma, a non-skull base meningioma for infection, and postoperative hematoma for the risk of neurologic worsening or 30-day mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS: Early postoperative complications in meningioma surgery have a negative impact on patient survival and postoperative neurologic status, in a disease where survival is usually not limited by the meningioma itself. In this study, we identified risk factors for early postoperative complications, the identification of at-risk populations may help to prevent the occurrence of these risk factors.

TI Carotid Cavernous Fistulas and Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas of the
   Cavernous Sinus: Validation of a New Classification According to Venous
   Drainage
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

ID ENDOVASCULAR MANAGEMENT; MALFORMATIONS; PROPOSAL; SYSTEM
AB BACKGROUND: Multiple carotid cavernous fistula (CCF) classifications have been proposed. However, they lacked predictive factors for the clinical presentation, natural history, and hemorrhagic risk. Our aim was to externally validate a new classification according to venous drainage (i.e., the Thomas classification [TC]) to assess its relationship with symptoms, endovascular treatment, and outcomes.
   METHODS: We performed a multicenter retrospective review of CCFs at 2 major academic institutions. The CCFs were classified using the Barrow classification (BC) and TC systems.
   RESULTS: The data from 94 patients with a diagnosis of CCF were collected during a study period 23 years, 4 months. Of these 94 patients, 89 had undergone CCF treatment and 5 had experienced spontaneous occlusion. Complete occlusion was achieved in 89.9% of the treated patients. Complications occurred in 5.3% of the patients, including permanent deficits in 2.1%. TC type 4 was associated with cortical symptoms compared with type 2 (P = 0.003) and type 3 (P < 0.001). The BC was not able to detect significant differences among the symptom types. Significant differences were found using the TC for the transarterial-only, transvenous anterior-only, and transvenous posterior-only approaches (P < 0.001, P = 0.03, and P = 0.001, respectively). The transvenous posterior and transvenous anterior approach were significantly associated with type 2 and 3 TC, respectively. Excluding direct CCFs, the BC was not related to the treatment approach. No significant differences in the outcomes were found. However, a trend toward a lower occlusion rate for TC type 4 compared with type 3 was observed.
   CONCLUSION: The TC provided useful information regarding the fistula anatomy and venous hemodynamics, which correlated with the clinical symptoms and treatment strategy.

AB OBJECTIVE: C5 palsy and axial pain are significant factors affecting the quality of life after posterior cervical surgery; however, there has been no clear and supportive conclusion on which method is more suitable in a certain case. As a result, we compare the clinical outcomes, complication rates, and anatomical changes between open-door laminoplasty (ODL) and laminectomy and fusion (LF) for cervical spondylotic myelopathy. This is a systematic literature review and meta-analysis.
   METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library. The following outcomes were extracted and analyzed: the cases of C5 palsy and axial pain patients, Japanese Orthopaedic Association, range of motion (ROM), and cervical curvature. Data analysis was conducted with RevMan 5.3. The I-2 statistics were used to evaluate heterogeneity.
   RESULTS: A total of 9 studies were included in the final analysis, all of which were prospective or retrospective cohort studies. The pooled data showed that the incidences of C5 palsy and axial pain in IF were higher than those in ODL. The study indicated that there was no significant difference in pre- and postoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores, preoperative cervical ROM, pre- and postoperative cervical curvature between the 2 groups, but there was significant difference in ROM after operation. These results indicate that ODL was superior to IF in maintaining cervical ROM.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the lower incidence of C5 palsy and axial pain can be achieved by using ODL compared with IF. However, current data only provide weak support, if any, favoring ODL over for clinical improvement in reduce these 2 complications.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore related factors that influence time to recurrence and prognosis of gliomas.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis of pathologic and clinical data of patients with glioma who underwent surgery for the first time and had a recurrence between 2009 and 2018 in West China Hospital was performed. Clinical characteristics of patients were reviewed, and survival analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors for the recurrent time. Molecules with differential changes in the paired samples were included in the survival analysis.
   RESULTS: A total of 84 patients met our inclusion requirements and were included in the study; other related factors were also considered in detail in the integrated analysis. Significant differences among O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (positive/negative), isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (positive/negative), and Ki-67 were determined by statistical analysis of paired samples (P = 0.013, P = 0.014, P = 0.017). Univariate analysis demonstrated that Ki-67 (low expression, medium expression, high expression), initial World Health Organization grade (low or high), tumor side (left, right, middle), age (>= 50 years, <50 years), and extent of resection were significantly correlated with time to recurrence (log-rank P = 0.008, P < 0.001, P = 0.015, P < 0.001, P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis results showed that Ki-67 lower expression (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.585, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.146-2.336, P = 0.448), medium expression (HR = 0.256, 95% CI = 0.084-0.784, P = 0.017), and high expression (HR = 1 as a reference) together with the initial World Health Organization grade (HR = 0.148, 95% CI = 0.029-0.749, P = 0.021) were independent predictive factors for glioma recurrence.
   CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive analysis revealed that initial World Health Organization grade and Ki-67 proliferative index were independent prognostic factors that predict the time to recurrence of glioma in patients after first surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the results of full-endoscopic decompression (FED) in lumbar lateral recess stenosis via an interlaminar or transforaminal approach.
   METHODS: A total of 102 patients with lumbar lateral recess stenosis who underwent FED from February 2015 to June 2016 in our hospital were enrolled. A total of 58 patients underwent interlaminar FED (IL-FED) and 44 patients underwent transforaminal FED (TF-FED). The intraoperative radiation and operation time, length of hospital stay, time to return to work, and complications were compared between both groups. The surgical effectiveness was assessed according to the visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and modified MacNab criteria.
   RESULTS: In the IL-FED group, the mean operation time was 59.4 +/- 8.5 minutes, and the intraoperative radiation time was 0.50 +/- 0.16 seconds. In the TF-FED group, the mean operation time was 64.1 +/- 10.2 minutes, and the intraoperative radiation time was 7.50 +/- 1.25 seconds. There were significant differences in the operation and radiation time between the 2 groups (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scoring between both groups either in the pre- or postoperation (P> 0.05). Based on the modified MacNab scores at the final follow-up, the satisfactory rate in the IL-FED group was 91.4% and that in the TF-FED group was 88.6%, no significant difference was observed between the 2 groups (P> 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: FED could provide satisfactory clinical outcomes for lumbar lateral recess stenosis. However, the IL-FED procedure demonstrated shorter operation time and lesser radiation exposure, but higher risk for anesthetic when compared with the TF-FED procedure.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of allograft bones combined with poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK) cages or titanium mesh cages (TMCs) in the management of cervical spinal tuberculosis.
   METHODS: A total of 16 patients with cervical spinal tuberculosis who underwent anterior debridement, reconstruction with allograft bones combined with PEEK cages or TMCs, and anterior plate fixation between 2013 and 2016 were retrospectively studied. Neck pain, neurologic status, operating time, intraoperative blood loss, cervical spine alignment, bony fusion, and self-reported clinical outcomes were reviewed.
   RESULTS: Six patients underwent 1 level reconstruction using PEEK cages and 10 patients received TMCs reconstruction. Patients received a mean follow-up time of 45.9 +/- 13.1 months. Neck pain was greatly relieved, as visual analog scale scores decreased from 4.6 +/- 1.3 preoperatively to 0.7 +/- 0.5 at the final follow-up (P < 0.05). Neurologic status was improved in all patients with neurologic deficits, with 9 patients improving by 1 grade and 1 patient by 2 grades. Kyphosis angle was corrected from 1.3 +/- 12.0 degrees preoperatively to -5.4 +/- 10.2 degrees post-operatively (P < 0.05) and remained at -3.6 +/- 9.6 degrees at the final follow-up (P < 0.05). Bony fusion was achieved in all patients, with a mean time to the fusion of 3.8 +/- 1.3 months. There was no implant failure or signs of cervical spinal tuberculosis recurrence. Excellent results, good results, and fair results were reported in 37.5%, 56.25%, and 6.25% of patients, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Allograft bone combined with PEEK cages and TMCs could bring about favorable clinical results in patients with cervical spinal tuberculosis. This method could be an alternative to autologous bone grafting method in the management of certain cases.

ID CLASSIFICATION; MALFORMATIONS
AB OBJECTIVE: Acquired pial arteriovenous fistula (pAVF) is an extremely rare intracranial vascular malformation, with few case reports in the English literature. This study presents a thorough review and analysis of all acquired pAVF cases from the literature in addition to an illustrated case.
   METHODS: We report a case with de novo development of intracranial pAVF after craniotomy. A medical literature database search between 1975 and 2018, including the Medline, Ovid, and PubMed databases, was performed to identify all reports with possible acquired lesions. Differences between these acquired lesions and previously reported primary lesions were evaluated.
   RESULTS: A total of 8 patients with de novo formation of acquired pAVF were included in this series. Most of these pAVFs were fed and drained via a similar arteriovenous pattern, from distal/cortical branches of the middle cerebral artery (6/8, 75%) to the superficial middle cerebral vein (6/8, 75%). Compared with a previously reported primary pAVF series, acquired pAVF tended to be asymptomatic (P < 0.0001) and found essentially in adults (P = 0.0061). Fewer venous varices (P = 0.0049) and associated intracranial mass effect (P = 0.0189) were found in the cases of acquired pAVF. All 4 reported acquired pAVFs that were treated microsurgically resulted in complete angiographic obliteration (4/4, 100%). The overall outcome was good or stable even with observation only (7/8, 87.5%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Acquired pAVF is highly correlated with sentinel neurosurgical procedures or venous occlusion events. These lesions should be regarded as a different disease entity from primary pAVF because of the relatively low-flow shunting and benign clinical course.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with frontal glioma might experience cognition alterations together with potential dysfunction of resting-state networks (RSNs). To understand the altered patterns of the intrinsic activity and underlying network interactions between the cognitive-related RSNs is of great importance.
   OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of the altered RSNs, including default mode network, executive control network, and salience network and further elucidate the possible functional reorganization of RSNs in patients with frontal glioma.
   METHODS: Thirteen patients with frontal glioma and 10 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. Independent component analysis was performed to identify the characteristics of the selected RSNs activity. Further, functional connectivity analysis was applied to investigate the relationship between the altered regions. Subsequently, partial correlation analysis was performed to examine associations between the neural activity of RSNs and neurocognitive characteristics.
   RESULTS: Compared with the HCs group, the patient group exhibited significant differences in functional connectivity among default mode network, executive control network, and salience network. In addition, the number of the significant functional connectivities between the paired seeds observed in the patients was greater than that in HCs and significantly increased functional connectivity was detected between left posterior cingulate cortex and right angular gyrus. Furthermore, altered neural activities in the RSNs of patients with frontal glioma were positively associated with certain aspects of cognitive function.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested underlying network functional reorganization of the triple unifying RSNs in patients with frontal glioma, providing novel insights for improving understanding of brain function.

TI Biomedical Glue Sling Technique in Microvascular Decompression for
   Trigeminal Neuralgia Caused by Atherosclerotic Vertebrobasilar Artery: A
   Description of Operative Technique and Clinical Outcomes
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Atherosclerotic vertebrobasilar artery; Biomedical glue sling;
   Microvascular decompression; Trigeminal neuralgia
ID FACIAL-PAIN; ECTASIA; SERIES; NERVE
AB BACKGROUND: Microvascular decompression (MVD) is the most definitive surgical treatment for trigeminal neuralgia (TN). In the case in which an atherosclerotic vertebrobasilar artery (aVBA) offends the trigeminal nerve, the postoperative outcomes have been reported to be less satisfactory in terms of symptom recurrence and complications. In this study, the authors present their experience using a biomedical sling for MVD in patients with aVBA-associated TN.
   METHODS: A retrospective study of 22 consecutive patients who underwent the biomedical glue sling technique in MVD for TN with aVBA was conducted between September 2016 and June 2017.
   RESULTS: Intraoperatively, aVBA was regarded as the direct or indirect offending vessel in 22 patients. In addition to aVBA, other vessels involved in neurovascular conflict included superior cerebellar artery in 12 patients, veins in 1, and anterior inferior cerebellar artery in 6. All 22 patients underwent the biomedical glue sling technique. Postoperatively, TN was completely resolved in 20 (91%) patients and partially relieved in 2 (9%) patients. During the follow-up period of 18-27 months, pain developed severely in those 2 patients but could be relieved with carbamaze-pine. As for complications, postoperative hypoacusia occurred immediately in 1 case, with complete resolution in 2 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: The biggest advantage of the biomedical glue sling technique is its simplicity in achieving complete decompression, requiring relatively less space and time. Because the outcome of traditional MVD regarding aVBA-associated TN remains controversial, the biomedical glue sling technique in MVD provides an alternative decompressive method for patients with TN associated with aVBA. However, further studies with a larger series and control group are required to prove the high effectiveness of this method.

   FIXATION; SPINAL-CORD; DISC; COMPRESSION; SUBLUXATION
AB BACKGROUND: The anterior-only surgical procedure, including discectomy, open reduction, fusion, and fixation, is a recommended approach in the treatment of cervical facet dislocations. This approach has a reduction failure rate of up to 40%. When it fails, a posterior approach is usually required.
   OBJECTIVE: To report a novel anterior-only surgical approach for reduction and fixation in patients with cervical facet dislocation, even for severe vertebral fracture, articular process fracture, and delayed surgical management.
   METHODS: Sixty-three consecutive patients with unilateral/bilateral facet dislocation of the subaxial cervical spine were treated with this anterior-only procedure. After discectomy, kyphotic paramedian distraction reduction with Caspar pins plus vertebral screw plate fixation was performed. If the reduction failed, anterior facetectomy reduction plus anterior cervical pedicle screw plate fixation was introduced.
   RESULTS: Among the 63 patients treated, 52 patients achieved successful reduction with the technique of kyphotic paramedian distraction with Caspar pins; the remaining 11 patients with failure of the former technique experienced successful reduction with the anterior facetectomy technique. No supplemental posterior approach surgery was performed. The American Spinal Injury Association grade was improved by at least 1 grade in 23 patients after this procedure, and no neurologic deterioration occurred in any of the patients. After at least 12 months of follow-up, all patients achieved satisfactory fusion, and there was no implant failure.
   CONCLUSIONS: An anterior-only surgical procedure including kyphotic paramedian distraction with Caspar pins, anterior facetectomy, and anterior pedicle screw plate fixation is safe and effective for subaxial cervical facet dislocations.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine whether fat infiltration in the multifidus muscle would predict surgical prognosis in patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS).
   METHODS: This ambispective cohort study enrolled 118 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for 14-5 single-segment DLSS. Fat infiltration rate (FIR) on magnetic resonance images of the multifidus muscle at L5-S1 were measured using ImageJ software. The enrolled patients were divided into FIR <25% and FIR >= 25% groups according to their FIR of the multifidus muscle at L5-S1. The 2 groups of patients who finished follow-up were further matched for the baseline covariates based on propensity scores. Patients' reported outcomes including the visual analog scale score for back pain and leg pain, and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score were compared between groups at follow-up and further adjusted using generalized linear models.
   RESULTS: Patients in the FIR <25% group showed statistically significantly greater reduction in ODI at 6 and 18 months after surgery than did patients in the FIR >= 25% group in either cohort regardless of adjustment; however, the 2-point between-group difference was smaller than the predefined minimum clinically important difference. In addition, more patients in the FIR <25% group achieved clinically significant improvement in ODI than those in the FIR 25% group in either complete cohort or matching cohort (63.8% vs. 21.1%, P < 0.001; 70.3% vs. 24.1%, P < 0.001, respectively) before and after adjustment (63.3% vs. 27.8%, P < 0.001; 69.1% vs. 31.0%, P < 0.001, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Fat infiltration in multifidus muscle at L5-S1 could be a potential predictor of functional improvement after surgery in patients with 14-5 single-segment DLSS.

   PROLIFERATION
AB OBJECTIVE: The current standard treatment of malignant glioma is maximal resection followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Temozolomide (TMZ) has been the first-line chemotherapeutic agent used, although to achieve a satisfactory clinical effect. TMZ chemoresistance could result from glioblastoma stem cells, which are critical for tumor initiation, recurrence, and therapeutic resistance and are potential targets. Moreover, signals mediated by the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) can positively regulate proliferation and tumorigenesis of glioma cells.
   RESULTS: To enhance TMZ's antitumor effect, we treated glioma cells with combinations of TMZ and DRD2 antagonists (DDRAs). The combined application of TMZ and DDRAs (haloperidol or risperidone) had synergistic effects and inhibited proliferation of glioma cells more significantly than did monotherapy. The combined treatment increased the levels of gamma H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) more significantly than did TMZ alone, although DDRAs alone had no effect on gamma H2AX levels. Moreover, the expression of DRD2 transcripts in U251 glioma cells and glioblastoma stem cells were significantly elevated after TMZ treatment, suggesting crosstalk between TMZ- and DRD2-mediated signaling. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we measured the expression of prosurvival proteins after treatment with either TMZ or DDRAs alone or combined. The results showed that DDRAs could inhibit the extracellular signal-related kinase signaling pathway and block TMZ-induced protective autophagy, which could explain why DDRAs increased the cytotoxicity of TMZ.
   CONCLUSIONS: We have provided evidence showing the synergistic effects of TMZ and DDRAs on suppressing glioma cell growth. Our study has provided novel insights on enhancing the effectiveness of chemotherapy against malignant glioma and eventually improving the clinical outcomes of patients with glioblastoma multiforme.

AB OBJECTIVE: The impact of antithrombotic agents on patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains controversial, especially patients who require emergent craniotomy. This study was undertaken to evaluate clinical outcomes in operated patients with ICH with and without previous antithrombotic agents.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study. Between January 2001 and December 2013, all patients with ICH who received emergent craniotomy and who were present in Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database were screened and divided into those with previous antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulant therapy, and nonantithrombotic therapy according to their health care claims data within 3 months of index admission. The primary end points included in-hospital mortality and complications and short-term outcome.
   RESULTS: Of 18,872 eligible patients, 16,251 (87.1%) did not receive any antithrombotic therapy, 2267 patients had antiplatelet therapy, and 354 patients had anticoagulation therapy. After propensity score matching, significantly more blood transfusions and craniectomies were identified in the patients with previous antithrombotic treatment compared with those undergoing nonantithrombotic therapy. Compared with the nonantithrombotic treatment cohort, patients under previous anticoagulant treatment had significantly higher in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 2.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.45-3.10). Furthermore, during the 6-month follow-ttp period, previous anticoagulant therapy was independently associated with a greater risk of all-cause mortality (P = 0.001). The in-hospital and 6-month all-cause mortality of patients with previous antiplatelet treatment was not significantly different from patients with nonantithrombotic treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested an increased risk of in-hospital mortality and poor short-term outcome among operated patients with ICH with previous antithrombotic therapy, particularly anticoagulant therapy, but not with antiplatelet therapy.

ID ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; CEREBRAL-ARTERIES; FLOW
AB BACKGROUND: Laminar wall sheer stress (LWSS) modulates inflammatory activity of the endothelium and may be a contributing factor in many cerebrovascular pathologies. There is a lack of consensus whether significant differences in LWSS exist between feeding vessels in brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) and healthy vessels. A systematic review of LWSS research in bAVM was undertaken, including the methods used and the assumptions made in determining LWSS.
   METHODS: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus electronic databases were systematically searched from inception for articles calculating LWSS in bAVM cases. LWSS values were extracted for comparison between ipsilateral bAVM feeding arteries and healthy contralateral vessels or healthy normative data.
   RESULTS: Three retrospective cohort studies were identified, reporting on 42 adult and pediatric bAVM cases. Mean LWSS (mLWSS) in healthy vessels (contralateral vessels or normative controls) typically ranged from 1.2-2.7 Pa, while mLWSS values in untreated bAVM feeding arteries typically ranged from 1.6-3.6 Pa. All studies had mixed cohorts of ruptured and unruptured cases, obscuring the relationship between LWSS and bAVM history.
   CONCLUSIONS: mLWSS values in healthy arteries and bAVM feeding vessels tend to be low and overlapping. Further research of high scientific and methodologic quality is necessary to improve understanding of how LWSS hemodynamics relate to bAVM formation, rupture, and treatment.

AB OBJECTIVE: Atypical (World Health Organization grade II) meningiomas (AMs) have been associated with a substantial risk of recurrence even after complete, gross total resection (GTR). The present study evaluated the clinical and AM tumor histopathological features that might predict for the risk of recurrence and survival within this patient population.
   METHODS: The data from 72 consecutive patients who had undergone primary GTR for AM from 2007 to 2016 and corresponding tumor specimens at a single institution were reviewed. The preoperative patient and tumor characteristics were correlated with the post-resection outcomes, including recurrence and 1-year survival. Cox regression models on recurrence-free survival (RFS) and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were performed.
   RESULTS: The overall 1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS estimates for the AM cohort were 100.0%, 82.4%, and 78.1% after resection, respectively. A high mitotic index was an independent predictor of RFS on Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio, 1.26; P = 0.008), and the tumor volume showed a trend toward a significant association (hazard ratio, 0.93; P = 0.079). Patient age and the mitotic index were significantly associated with 1-year mortality (odds ratio, 1.11 and 1.36, respectively; P = 0.028 and P = 0.045, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: AM tumors with a high proliferative index showed an increased likelihood of recurrence and short-term survival even after complete GTR. A smaller tumor volume might also have contributed to an increased risk of recurrence for patients with AM. Although other histopathological features were not linked to recurrence or mortality for patients with AM, the biopsy findings can indicate key predictive information, and further molecular analysis might reveal additional prognostic markers.

AB PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the feasibility, safety, and fusion results of posterior transarticular stand-alone screw (SAS) instrumentation of C1-C2 with a minimally invasive technique to those of a posterior midline exposure.
   METHODS: Between 2008 and 2016, 164 patients underwent surgical treatment for traumatic injuries to the upper cervical vertebrae at our institution. We included 38 patients (27 men and 11 women; age range, 17-81 years) in the study. The posterior midline approach (PMA) group (23 patients) included patients who underwent surgery by means of a conventional midline incision after percutaneous screw insertion. The transmuscular approach (TMA) group (15 patients) included patients who underwent SAS fixation by use of a minimally invasive technique. The mean follow-up period was 58 months (range, 12-118 months).
   RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed that the operative time, blood loss volume, and severity of postoperative pain were lower in the TMA group. No significant excess of radiation exposure to the surgical team and the patients occurred in TMA group compared with the PMA group. C1- C2 fusion was observed in 37 patients. Stable fibrous fusion between the C1 and C2 vertebrae was found in 1 patient.
   CONCLUSIONS: A minimally invasive technique by use of a paravertebral transmuscular approach provides an alternative to routine posterior transarticular SAS fixation of C1 and C2 through a posterior midline approach. The minimally invasive technique reduces the duration of surgery and the volume of blood loss, decreases the severity of postoperative pain, and does not increase the amount of radiation exposure for the surgical team and the patient.

AB OBJECTIVE: The rectus capitis lateralis (RCL) is a small cervical muscle that arises from the transverse process of Cl and is intimately related to the jugular process and jugular foramen. We describe its morphology, neurovascular relationships, and its utility as one of the key surgical landmarks in approaches to the jugular foramen.
   METHODS: Eight cadaveric heads were used to perform far-lateral and transmastoid approaches to the jugular foramen. The neurovascular relationships of the RCL were studied.
   RESULTS: The RCL originates from the transverse process of C1 and inserts onto the jugular process. It can be found in the muscular interval between the posterior belly of the digastric muscle and the superior oblique muscle with the occipital artery coursing between it and the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. It lies directly posterior to the internal jugular vein and cranial nerves (CNs) IX-XI as they exit the jugular foramen. The vertebral artery courses medially to the RCL as it exits foramen transversarium of C1. As the facial nerve exits the stylomastoid foramen, it is anterolateral to the RCL before turning to enter the parotid gland. The CN XII is seen between the RCL and the occipital condyle from a posterior view.
   CONCLUSIONS: The RCL usually is preserved unless jugular process needs to be removed to expose the jugular foramen. The RCL is an important surgical landmark for the early identification of the vertebral artery, internal jugular vein, facial nerve, and CNs IX-XII in approaches to the jugular foramen.

AB OBJECTIVE: Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are largely underdiagnosed and may have persistent refractory consequences. Current assessments for acute TBI are limited to physical examination and imaging. Biomarkers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), and S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B) have shown predictive value as indicators of TBI and potential screening tools.
   METHODS: In total, 37 controls and 118 unique trauma subjects who received a clinically ordered head computed tomography (CT) in the emergency department of a level 1 trauma center were evaluated. Blood samples collected at 0-8 hours (initial) and 12-32 hours (delayed) postinjury were analyzed for GFAP, UCH-L1, and S100B concentrations. These were then compared in CT-negative and CT-positive subjects.
   RESULTS: Median GFAP, UCH-L1, and S100B concentrations were greater in CT-positive subjects at both timepoints compared with CT-negative subjects. In addition, median UCH-L1 and S100B concentrations were lower at the delayed timepoint, whereas median GFAP concentrations were increased. As predictors of a positive CT of the head, GFAP outperformed UCH-L1 and S100B at both timepoints (initial: 0.89 sensitivity, 0.62 specificity; delayed: 0.94 sensitivity, 0.67 specificity). GFAP alone also outperformed all possible combinations of biomarkers.
   CONCLUSIONS: GFAP, UCH-L1, and S100B demonstrated utility for rapid prediction of a CT-positive TBI within 0-8 hours of injury. GFAP exhibited the greatest predictive power at 12-32 hours. Furthermore, these results suggest that GFAP alone has greater utility for predicting a positive CT of the head than UCH-L1, S100B, or any combination of the 3.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze the stability of lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) and compare various methods of supplemental fixation in adjacent-segment disease.
   METHODS: Four fresh-frozen human cadaveric lumbar spines (L1 to sacrum) were used for motion analysis in extension, flexion, and lateral bending. The L4 - L5 level was secured with a lateral interbody cage and pedicle screws to simulate a fused segment. The adjacent segment (L3- L4) was evaluated with flexibility testing sequentially under the following conditions: native disc (control), LLIF cage, cage with lateral plate, pedicle screws with z-rod, and single-rod construct. The difference in mean displacement (millimeters) between groups was studied by the analysis of variance and post-hoc Tukey test.
   RESULTS: Mean displacement (millimeters) on averaging motion in all planes was 0.741 for native disc, 0.273 for cage, 0.183 for cage with plate, 0.086 for pedicle screws and z-rod, and 0.106 for the single-rod construct. All 4 constructs led to a significant reduction (P < 0.001) in displacement in extension and flexion, as compared with native disc. There was no demonstrable superiority between the 4 constructs as the mean displacements were not significantly different from each other.
   CONCLUSIONS: LLIF with and without supplemental fixation reduced motion significantly at the adjacent segment as compared with intact disc. There was a trend toward increasing rigidity with supplemental fixation (plate and pedicle screw constructs). Further biomechanical studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these initial findings.

AB OBJECTIVE: The natural history and long-term durability of Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC) embolization is still unknown. We hypothesize a stepwise decrease in durability of embolized cerebral aneurysms as stratified by the Modified Raymond-Roy Classification (MRRC).
   METHODS: First-time GDC-embolized cerebral aneurysms were retrospectively reviewed from 2004 to 2015. Loss of durability (LOD) was defined by change in aneurysm size or patency seen on serial radiographic follow-up. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to evaluate embolization durability. Multivariate Cox regression modeling was used to assess baseline aneurysm and patient characteristics for their effect on LOD.
   RESULTS: A total of 427 patients with 443 aneurysms met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 89 (21%) aneurysms met LOD criteria. Grade 1 aneurysms had statistically significantly greater durability than did all other MRRC grades. Grade 3b aneurysms had significantly worse durability than did all other aneurysm grades. There was no difference in durability between grade 2 and 3a aneurysms. Of aneurysms with LOD, 26 (29%) experienced worsening of MRRC grade. Thirty-five (24%) initial MRRC grade 2, 72 (45%) initial MRRC grade 3a, and 6 (22%) initial MRRC grade 3b aneurysms progressed to MRRC grade 1 without retreatment. In our multivariate analysis, only initial MRRC grade was statistically significantly associated with treatment durability (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: MRRC grade is independently associated with first-time GDC-embolized cerebral aneurysm durability. Achieving MRRC grade 1 occlusion outcome is significantly associated with greater long-term GDC durability. Although few aneurysms experience further growth and/or recanalization, most incompletely obliterated aneurysms tend to remain stable over time or even progress to occlusion. Grading scales such as the MRRC are useful for characterizing aneurysm occlusion but may lack sensitivity and specificity for characterizing changes in aneurysm morphology over time.

AB BACKGROUND: Skull base chordoma can be a challenging surgical entity because of its invasive nature.
   OBJECTIVE: In this study, the role of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) to optimize the resection of skull base chordomas is evaluated.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of operated patients with skull base chordomas in the setting of iMRI. The clinical records, operative notes, radiologic images, tumor volumetry, location of the residual tumor, and surgical outcome were evaluated.
   RESULTS: Fifteen patients were operated on for resection of skull base chordomas between 2010 and 2017 in our institution. Gross total resection was planned and achieved in 8 patients and partial resection in 7 patients. In 8 patients (53.3%), the preoperatively planned volume of resection was achieved and confirmed in the first iMRI control. In 7 patients, repeated iMRI controls were required to achieve the surgical target. In 3 patients, the tumor residual requiring further resection was located in the clivus and in 4 patients in the intradural space. The improvement of the preoperative deficits showed a significant statistical association with the resection of the intradural component and decompression of the brainstem.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that iMRI is a safe method for intraoperative assessment of the degree of resection and the volume and location of residual tumor when resecting skull base chordomas. When gross total resection of the tumor is not feasible, iMRI can be a useful tool for targeted tumor resection.

ID FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SPONTANEOUS FLUCTUATIONS; NETWORK
AB OBJECTIVE: In this study, we present our experience using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in preoperative planning. We performed group analysis to demonstrate the effects of brain tumor on resting-state networks (RSNs).
   METHODS: Thirty patients with supratentorial gliomas were included in the study. Preoperative rs-fMRI and structural magnetic resonance imaging were performed in all cases. The rs-fMRI was preprocessed (realignment, slice time correction, coregistration to structural images, normalization, and smoothing). The structural images were segmented and normalized. Band filtering and denoising were applied to the functional images. Connectivity analysis was performed using seed-based connectivity analysis (SCA) at single subject level and group level. Correlation algorism has been used with r > 0.5.
   RESULTS: RSNs could be detected in all patients. They showed similarity to the results of the task-based fMRI, when task-based fMRI was feasible. Detection of the networks was also possible in patients with neurologic deficits, in whom task-based fMRI was not possible. We could use SCA in patients under anesthesia. High-level networks (default mode, salience, and dorsal attention networks) were detectable but showed a wide spectrum of spatial alterations and component disconnections.
   CONCLUSIONS: rs-fMRI is a feasible method for extended brain mapping. Diverse RSNs could be detected in patients with brain tumors and could be applied in preoperative planning. SCA was a robust and direct approach for data analysis and could answer specific clinically relevant questions. However, further studies are needed to validate the technique and its clinical impact.

TI Presence of an Anterior Communicating Artery as a Prognostic Factor in
   Revascularization for Anterior Circulation Acute Ischemic Stroke
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Acute ischemic stroke; Anterior communicating artery; Revascularization
AB BACKGROUND: No reports have evaluated collateral circulation using simpler measures involving magnetic resonance imaging. Because an anterior communicating artery (A-com) is important in collateral circulation, we investigated whether the presence of an A-com affected the clinical revascularization outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in the anterior circulation.
   METHODS: The present retrospective study included 73 patients who had undergone continuous administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and revascularization for AIS in the anterior circulation from April 2014 to September 2018. The presence of an A-com was evaluated using preoperative time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography. The patient characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared, and we investigated the influence of the presence or absence of an A-com on these clinical outcomes. The clinical outcomes were analyzed using multiple logistic regression.
   RESULTS: The clinical outcomes did not significantly correlate with age, sex, or occlusion location but did significantly correlate with the preoperative National Institute of Health stroke scale score, diffusion-weighted Alberta Stroke Program early computed tomography score, reperfusion >50% (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grade >2b), and onset to recanalization time. The presence of an A-corn correlated significantly with good clinical outcomes (modified Rankin scale score 0-3; P = 0.0081) and reduced mortality (P = 0.03). Multiple logistic regression predicted for significantly good clinical outcomes with the presence of an A-com (odds ratio, 17.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.85-157.10; P = 0.012).
   CONCLUSIONS: The presence of an A-com on preoperative time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography is a good prognostic factor for revascularization in patients with anterior circulation AIS, confirms collateral circulation, and allows for faster and safer endovascular treatment.

AB INTRODUCTION: Contemporary approaches it . o surgical site infections have evolved significantly over the last several decades in response to the economic pressures of soaring health care costs and increasing patient expectations of safety. Neurosurgeons face multiple unique challenges when striving to avoid as well as manage surgical implant infections. The tissue compartment, organ system, or joint is characterized by biological factors and physical forces that may not be universally relevant. Such implants, once rare, are now routine. Although the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of surgical site infections involving neural implants has advanced, guidelines are ever changing, and the incidence still exceeds acceptable levels. We assess the impact of these factors on a new class of implantable neuromodulation devices.
   METHODS: The available evidence along with practice patterns were examined and organized to establish relevant groupings for continuing evaluation and to propose justifiable recommendations for the treatment of infections that might arise in the case of intradural spinal cord stimulators.
   RESULTS: Few studies in the modern era have systematically evaluated preventive behaviors that were applied to intradural neural implants alone. We anticipate that future efforts will focus even more on the investigation of modifiable factors along a continuum from bacterially repellant implants to weight management. Early diagnosis could offer the best hope for device salvage but to date has been largely understudied.
   CONCLUSIONS: Historically, prevention is the cornerstone to infection mitigation. However, immediate diagnosis and hardware salvage have not received the attention deserved, and that approach may be especially important for intradural devices.

   indication; Treatment strategy
ID MANAGEMENT; INCIDENTALOMAS; APOPLEXY
AB BACKGROUND: The availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has led to an increase in the detection of pituitary incidentaloma (PI). However, there are no robust data on surgical treatment of PI on which to base therapeutic recommendations. This study was performed to investigate the significance of surgery for asymptomatic nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA) among PIs.
   METHODS: A total of 180 patients that underwent tumor resection of pituitary adenoma via the transsphenoidal approach between 2005 and 2017 were reviewed. Thirty-three consecutive patients with subjectively asymptomatic NFPA were included in this study. Our surgical indications for asymptomatic NFPAs were categorized as follows: macroadenoma with optic chiasma compression (group A, n = 14), solid tumor >= 2 cm in size (group B, n = 7), and tumor growth on follow-up MRI (group C, n = 12). The clinical outcomes were analyzed accordingly.
   RESULTS: Seven patients (50%) in group A showed subjective improvement of visual function after tumor resection even though they had no complaints preoperatively. On the other hand, no changes occurred in any cases in group B or group C. Although there were no critical complications in this series, the incidence of nonnegligible nasal complications was relatively high (24.2%) and may decrease the patient's quality of life.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgery should be recommended for asymptomatic NFPA with optic chiasma compression to improve visual outcome. On the other hand, immediate intervention for other asymptomatic NFPA to reduce the likelihood of the appearance of tumor-related symptoms remains questionable considering its invasiveness to the nose.

AB BACKGROUND: The telemedicine program in Albania includes a specialized teleneurotrauma program. There is only 1 national trauma center with neurosurgery capability in the capital city of Tirana. Patients with isolated head or spine injury who require consultation with neurosurgeons located at the National Trauma Center receive telemedicine consultation. The aim of this follow-up study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a nationwide teleneurotrauma network in preventing unnecessary transfers for neurotrauma.
   METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed of prospectively collected data on all telemedicine consultations for isolated neurotrauma from March 2014 to February 2018. All teleconsultations were coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision coding system (codes S00, S01-S010).
   RESULTS: Of 590 teleconsultations for neurotrauma, most patients (76%) were male (median age 46.5 years; range, 1-93 years); 403 (68.31%; mean age 45.12 years) did not require a transfer to the tertiary center, and 187 (mean age 42.47 years) were transferred. An average 12.5 (monthly average range, 8.5-16) patients were seen monthly with a steady increase to a mature telemedicine program at the present time. Most teleconsultations (70.67%) occurred during business hours (8:00 AM 4:30 PM); 173 (29.32%) occurred at night and on weekends. Analysis by diagnosis indicated that most cases of low severity were not transferred, whereas higher severity cases were twice as likely to be transferred (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Structured and coordinated telemedicine for neurotrauma increases access to care for neurosurgery patients in countries that do not have widespread neurosurgery services. Nearly 70% of patients may be treated locally by nonneurosurgeons.

AB BACKGROUND: Microscopic delineation and clearance of tumor cells at neurosurgical excision margins potentially reduce tumor recurrence and increase patient survival. Probe-based in vivo fluorescence microscopy technologies are promising for neurosurgical in vivo microscopy.
   OBJECTIVE: We sought to demonstrate a flexible fiberoptic epifluorescence microscope capable of enhanced architectural and cytological imaging for in vivo microscopy during neurosurgical procedures.
   METHODS: Eighteen specimens were procured from neurosurgical procedures. These specimens were stained with acridine orange and imaged with a 3-dimensional (3D)-printed epifluorescent microscope that incorporates a flexible fiberoptic probe. Still images and video sequence frames were processed using frame alignment, signal projection, and pseudo-coloring, resulting in resolution enhancement and an increased field of view.
   RESULTS: Images produced displayed good nuclear contrast and architectural detail. Grade 1 meningiomas demonstrated 3D chords and whorls. Low-grade meningothelial nuclei showed streaming and displayed regularity in size, shape, and distribution. Oligodendrogliomas showed regular round nuclei and a variably staining background. Glioblastomas showed high degrees of nuclear pleomorphism and disarray. Mitoses, vascular proliferation, and necrosis were evident.
   CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the utility of a 3D-printed, flexible probe microscope for high-resolution microscopic imaging with increased architectural detail. Enhanced in vivo imaging using this device may improve our ability to detect and decrease microscopic tumor burden at excision margins during neurosurgical procedures.

DT Article
DE Beta 2 transferrin; Diagnosis; Malfunction; Ventriculoperitoneal shunt
ID CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; DIAGNOSIS
AB OBJECTIVE: Ventriculoperitoneal shunt is the most common cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedure to treat hydrocephalus. With the change of physiologic cerebrospinal fluid absorption site from arachnoid granulations to the peritoneum, beta 2 transferrin enters the systemic circulation. Therefore, the detection of beta 2 transferrin in the blood can possibly be used as a noninvasive method to assess the functional status of the shunt. The objective of this study was to study the presence of beta 2 transferrin in patients with functional shunts and in shunts suspected of being malfunctional.
   METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from a group of 20 patients with functional ventriculoperitoneal shunts, from a control group of 10 age-matched healthy volunteers, and from 8 patients with suspected shunt malfunction (6 ventriculoperitoneal, 2 lumboperitoneal). Blood serum beta 2 transferrin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with specific anti-beta 2 transferrin antibodies.
   RESULTS: The mean age in the ventriculoperitoneal shunt group was 36.5 years (range, 24-50 years). The mean age in the control group was 39.5 years (range, 32-48). There was no statistical difference in age between the groups. Beta 2 transferrin levels were 1.99 +/- 1.02 ng/mL in the ventriculoperitoneal shunt group and 0.05 +/- 0.02 ng/mL in the control group; the statistical difference was strongly significant (P < 0.001). Patients presenting with suspected shunt malfunction had preoperative low beta 2 transferrin levels (0.10 +/- 0.12). Postoperatively, their beta 2 transferrin levels increased to 1.75 +/- 0.46 ng/ml, and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.012).
   CONCLUSION: Blood beta 2 transferrin can be used as a noninvasive test to assess the functional status of a shunt.

DT Article
DE Classification; Consistency; Predictive factor; Rathke's cleft cyst
ID CLINICAL-FEATURES; MR; MANAGEMENT; MANIFESTATIONS; HEADACHE
AB Objective: Rathke's cleft cysts (RCCs) may have various anatomic, clinical, and radiologic characteristics, which may be related to their differences in texture or consistency. The purpose of the study was to investigate RCCs based on consistency.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 25 cases of patients with RCCs who underwent endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery between 2008 and 2018. Cases were divided into 3 types based on cyst consistency: fluid (serous) or type A (n = 4); semi-fluid (mucoid) or type B (n = 17); and non-fluid (caseous) or type C (n = 4). Demographic, clinical, radiologic, and surgical characteristics for each group were analyzed.
   Results: All type A RCCs (100%) had visual impairment. The mean age (42.8 +/- 13 years) and cyst volume (2442.5 +/- 533.6 mm(3)) were higher in these patients. T1-weighted images were hypointense and T2-weighted images were hyperintense on magnetic resonance imaging. Type B RCCs were more frequently encountered (68%). Although headache was the most common (82.3%) symptom, endocrine disorders were also prevalent (52.9%). T1-weighted images were typically isointense or hyperintense on magnetic resonance imaging. Type C RCCs had the youngest patient population (30.3 +/- 10.2 years) and T2-weighted images were predominantly hypointense in this group.
   Conclusions: The proposed novel consistency classification of RCCs will provide a practical tool for more accurately estimating the nature of the pathology, because each type has its own specific characteristics. Furthermore, the new classification of RCCs may aid in planning a consistency-specific surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-pMRI) to predict certain immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarkers of glioblastoma (GB) in this pilot study.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 36 patients (male/female, 25:11; mean age, 53 years; age range, 29-85 years) who had pretreatment DCE-pMRI with IHC analysis of their excised GBs. Regions of interest of the enhancing tumor (ER) and nonenhancing peritumoral region (NER) were used to calculate DCE-pMRI parameters of volume transfer constant, back flux constant, volume of the extravascular extracellular space, initial area under enhancement curve, and maximum slope. IHC biomarkers including Ki-67 labeling index, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (OLIG2), isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), and p53 mutation status were determined. The imaging metrics of GB with IHC markers were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman correlation analysis.
   RESULTS: Among 30 patients with available IDH1 status, 14 patients (46.6%) had IDH1 mutation. EGFR amplification was present in 24/36 (66.6%) patients. Mean Ki-67 labeling index was 29% (range, 1.5%-80%). p53 mutation was present in 20/36 GBs (55%), whereas OLIG2 expression was positive in 29/36 GBs (80.5%). Various DCE-pMRI parameters gathered from the ER and NER were significantly correlated with IDH1 mutation, EGFR amplification, and OLIG2 expression (P < 0.05). Ki-67 labeling index showed a strong positive correlation with initial area under enhancement curve (r = 0.619; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: DCE-pMRI could determine surrogate IHC biomarkers in GB via tumoral and peritumoral approach, potential targets for individualized treatment protocols.

AB BACKGROUND: Data regarding the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after spine surgery are scarce. Identifying ideal candidates for pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis and balancing the risk of thromboembolic complications against the risk of permanent neurologic deficits from a spinal epidural hematoma (SEH) are difficult. Even guidelines cannot suggest the standard of thromboprophylaxis.
   OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify the incidence of and risk factors for VTE after spine surgery in the Korean population. In addition, the rate of pharmacoprophylaxis and the incidence of SEH after spine surgery were analyzed.
   METHODS: The study cohort was generated by extracting patients with disease codes of spine surgery and VTE from the Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service National Inpatient Sample in 2014.
   After analyzing the incidence of VTE after spine surgery, a univariate comparison was performed to examine the possible relationship between the incidence of VTE and the independent variable. Variables found to be significant were included in a multivariable analysis model for further analysis.
   RESULTS: The incidence of VTE was 2.09% among all 21,261 patients who had spine surgery, and prophylaxis was applied to 7.89% of all patients who had spine surgery. Comorbidities and surgery-related risk factors were venous disease, cancer, respiratory disease, prolonged surgery hours, and increased total blood loss. Hospital-related risk factors were the location and hospital size.
   CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the incidence of VTE and the risk factors, more active prophylaxis is suggested for patients in the Korean population who undergo spine surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the immediate postoperative clinical outcomes and perform a preliminary analysis of the effectiveness of biportal endoscopic approaches to lumbar decompressive laminectomy in the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis.
   METHODS: All participants (64 patients) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the biportal endoscopic lumbar decompressive laminectomy (BE-D) group or the mini-open microscopic lumbar decompressive laminectomy (MI-D) group. Early postoperative outcomes were evaluated using clinical and surgical technique-related outcomes. The visual analog scale (VAS) pain score was measured at 6 time points after surgery (at 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48 hours and 2 weeks). Surgical technique-related outcomes were also analyzed.
   RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the preoperative demographics between the 2 groups. The VAS pain score from 8 to 48 hours (P < 0.05) was significantly lower in the BE-D group than in the MI-D group. Moreover, the total amount of fentanyl usage was higher in the MI-D group than in the BE-D group after surgery (P = 0.026). The length of hospital stay was lower in the BE-D group than in the MI-D group (P = 0.048). The operative time and creatinine phosphokinase level were not significantly different between the groups (P >0.05). Postoperative drainage was significantly higher in the BE-D group than in the MI-D group.
   CONCLUSIONS: BE-D was associated with rapid pain recovery, low fentanyl usage, and early discharge after surgery, but its other benefits have not yet been shown.

AB OBJECTIVE: The Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS) is widely used to assess mechanical instability in metastatic spine disease. We sought to identify a cutoff within the "potentially unstable" category, above which lesions were more likely than not to be stabilized.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients consulted for metastatic spine disease over a 1-year period. Patients were included if they were neurologically intact and had complete medical records, including preoperative imaging of every tumor-involved level. Examined variables included epidural spinal cord compression, SINS, revised Tokuhashi grade, age at consultation, and Karnofsky Performance Status. The primary endpoint was whether or not the lesions were stabilized.
   RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 51 patients (average age, 61 +/- 2 years) with a total of 436 lesions; 50.5% were lytic, and 31.4% were blastic. The most common primaries were lung (n = 12), breast (n = 10) and prostate (n = 8). The median SINS across all lesions was 5. In both lesion- and patient-based analysis, a SINS >= 10 portended a >50% probability of undergoing stabilization; only 11% of all patients with a SINS <= 9 underwent instrumented fusion. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that SINS (odds ratio [OR], 2.44; P < 0.01) and Karnofsky Performance Status (OR, 1.10; P < 0.01) were independent predictors of stabilization.
   CONCLUSIONS: For vertebrae affected by metastatic disease, the decision to stabilize remains dependent on both the radiographic lesion properties and the patient's clinical picture. However, our results suggest that lesions with a SINS of <= 9 might not require stabilization.

TI Embolization of very small (<= 3 mm) unruptured intracranial aneurysms:
   A large single-center experience on treatment of unruptured versus
   ruptured cases
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE Balloon; Coil; Embolization; Very small aneurysms

AB OBJECTIVE: In selected cases, embolization can be indicated for very small unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Previous studies reported high intraprocedural rupture rates. Recent improvements of endovascular devices and availability of small, soft platinum coils may lead to improved safety and efficacy profiles.
   METHODS: Retrospective review of embolizations for unruptured and ruptured intracranial aneurysms with maximal diameter <= 3 mm between January 1, 2009, and January 15, 2018. Infectious aneurysms were excluded. Patient files were used to extract aneurysm characteristics, complications, and immediate and long-term results.
   RESULTS: We identified 99 embolizations for 97 patients with 100 aneurysms, of which 70 aneurysms were unruptured. Initial success rate was 92.9%. We observed 1 asymptomatic intraprocedural perforation of an unruptured aneurysm, accounting for 1.4% of unruptured cases (1% of all embolizations). Neurological morbidity was 2.8% for unruptured aneurysms and 3.3% for ruptured aneurysms (P = 0.89). There was no procedural mortality. Follow-up was available for 85 (93.4%) patients. After 28.2 months (2-77), there was no aneurysmal bleeding; 2 (2.2%) aneurysms needed retreatment. Long-term results (30.5 months [3-77]) were available for all unruptured aneurysms. Among 64 successfully embolized unruptured aneurysms, 5 (7.8%) had residual neck filling and 1 (1.5%) needed retreatment. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics or complications between ruptured and unruptured aneurysms.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the context of technical evolution of endovascular devices, we observed a procedural perforation rate lower than previously reported, low morbidity and no mortality. Further prospective studies are warranted to update our knowledge about safety of embolization for very small intracranial aneurysms.

AB BACKGROUND: The Pipeline embolization device (PED) is commonly used for the treatment of distal internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms, which often require placing the stent across the origin of the precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA-A1). We sought to characterize the clinical and angiographic consequences of this maneuver.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database of patients treated with the PED at a single academic center from 2011 to 2017 to find patients for whom the PED was extended across the origin of the ACA-A1. The patient demographic data, pretreatment angiographic imaging findings, sizing of the bilateral A1 and ipsilateral M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA-M1), and follow-up angiographic and clinical imaging findings were recorded.
   RESULTS: A total of 27 patients were included in the present study (8 men and 19 women; age, 52 + 14.9 years). Follow-up angiography was conducted at a median of 9.2 months (interquartile range, 6; range, 5-84). The covered A1 segment was patent in 17 patients (63%). The covered ACA-A1/ipsilateral MCA-M1 ratio was 1.43 times greater for the patent ACA-A1 segments than those that were occluded (P = 0.0006). Similarly, the covered ACA-A1/contralateral ACA-A1 ratio was significantly larger statistically (1.64; P < 0.0001) for the patent ACA-A1 segments than that for those that were occluded. None of the patients developed clinical or radiographic signs of ACA stroke. The modified Rankin scale worsened for 1 patient during follow-up owing to a further decline of presenting vision loss.
   CONCLUSIONS: The PED can be used to treat aneurysms with deployment from the MCA-M1 to the ICA without resulting in ACA stroke. Ipsilateral A1 segment dominance might be predictive of continued blood flow into the ACA after deployment at this location.

AB BACKGROUND: Fluorescein-guided surgery of high-grade gliomas (HGGs) increases the extent of tumor resection but its efficacy has been questioned, especially for tumors located close to functional networks. In these cases, navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) may be used to plan and guide a safe resection. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of these techniques combined with intraoperative neurophysiologic mapping (IONM) to achieve the maximal safe resection of tumors located in the motor area.
   METHODS: We collected data of patients operated using a multimodal combination of sodium fluorescein-guided resection, nTMS motor planning, and IONM for HGGs in the motor area. The nTMS planning accuracy, extent of resection, and postoperative motor and functional status were compared with a matched control group of patients with HGG operated on only by IONM-guided resection.
   RESULTS: Forty-one patients treated by multimodal approach (group A) and 41 controls (group B) were included. The nTMS-based planning reliably identified the tumor/motor pathway spatial relationship (accuracy, 92.68%). We obtained in group A versus controls a higher gross total resection rate (73.17% vs. 51.22%; P = 0.04), and a reduction of cases with new permanent motor deficits (9.75% vs. 29.27%; P = 0.04) or Karnofsky Performance Status worsening (12.19% vs. 31.71%; P = 0.03).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the role of the combination of sodium fluorescein-guided resection and nTMS-based planning for surgery of HGGs close to the motor pathway. This multimodal approach in combination with IONM may lead to customized preoperative planning, increased extent of resection, and improved functional outcome, compared with standard IONM-guided surgery.

   COIL EMBOLIZATION; SAFETY; EXPERIENCE
AB OBJECTIVE: Despite the development of 4 grading scales of angiographic outcome after flow diversion for cerebral aneurysms, none have been widely adopted in the neurosurgical literature, nor have any been validated in an independent dataset. We evaluated the reported grading scales for their ability to predict aneurysm occlusion at follow-up.
   METHODS: Four reported grading scales were applied in a retrospective analysis of our prospectively maintained institutional database of patients with intracranial aneurysms treated with flow-diverting stents. Analysis of patient factors, aneurysm factors, and outcomes was made to compare the grading scales' ability to predict aneurysm occlusion.
   RESULTS: Ninety-nine aneurysms in 90 patients treated at our institution between 2011 and 2018 were included in the analysis. Lower Flow-Diverting Stent Score (FDSS) scores were associated with higher rates of aneurysm occlusion at final follow-up (P=0.004). The OKM, Kamran-Byrne, and SMART scales scores were not associated with aneurysm occlusion at final follow-up even after adjustments for baseline differences. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the FDSS was 0.675 (0.534-0.816).
   CONCLUSIONS: Although the FDSS was the only reported grading scale that was significantly associated with occlusion at follow-up, its ability to predict occlusion fell below the typical level for widespread clinical utility. The high rate of eventual occlusion of most aneurysms after flow diversion likely limits the clinical utility of a grading score for this application.

AB BACKGROUND: Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is a serious and frequent complication following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The pathophysiology behind DCI remains poorly understood, but inflammation has been proposed to play a significant role. This study investigated the relationship between plasma levels of some of the most important inflammatory markers and DCI, cerebral vasospasm, and functional outcome in patients with SAH.
   METHODS: In 90 patients with SAH, interleukin-6, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (HsCRP), interleukin-8, interleukin-10, interferon gamma, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were measured in peripheral blood day 3 and day 8 after SAH. Any occurrence of DCI or infection was recorded, and computed tomography angiography was performed on day 8. Clinical outcome was assessed after 3 months.
   RESULTS: HsCRP on day 3 was higher in patients with angiographic vasospasm (P = 0.003), and HsCRP on day 8 was higher in patients with poor outcome (P = 0.014). No association with DCI, vasospasm, or outcome was found for any of the remaining analyzed substances.
   CONCLUSIONS: High plasma levels of HsCRP were significantly associated with angiographic vasospasm and clinical outcome. Plasma levels of interleukin-6, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, interleukin-8, interleukin-10, interferon gamma, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were not associated with DCI, angiographic vasospasm, or clinical outcome at 3 months.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate malfunctioning of ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) valves in patients with brain tumors compared with patients with VPS for nontumoral etiologies to identify risk factors for shunt malfunction.
   METHODS: Medical charts of all adult patients who underwent VPS surgery for hydrocephalus between 2011 and 2016 were reviewed. Incidence and risk factors for revision surgery due to valve malfunction were identified in patients with brain tumors (group A) and patients without brain tumors (group B).
   RESULTS: Group A comprised 89 patients, and group B comprised 164 patients. The median follow-up time was 17 months for the entire cohort (9.4 months for group A vs. 25 months for group B, P< 0.001). VPS revision was performed in 60 patients (23.7%); 11 revisions involved valve failures necessitating valve replacement. Valve failures were significantly more common in group A (10 group A patients vs. 1 group B patient, P < 0.001). The distal or proximal shunt revision rate for reasons other than the valve was similar for both groups. Group A patients had a significantly higher cerebrospinal fluid protein level (44.5 mg/dL vs. 27.79 mg/dL, P< 0.05), and patients with valve failure had a 3-fold higher cerebrospinal fluid protein level compared with group A patients who experienced any type of shunt failure (96.3 mg/dL vs. 30.6 mg/dL, P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Shunt malfunction occurred mainly in patients with brain tumors and high cerebrospinal fluid protein levels. These patients are at high risk of valve failure and should be closely observed for emergent valve revision.

AB BACKGROUND: Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is a common neurosurgical condition, especially among elderly patients. Here we have analyzed our institutional experience with surgical management of CSDH. We aimed at identifying predictors of hematoma recurrence and cure, and the respective time course.
   METHODS: Pertinent data were collected from all 208 patients (136 males; median age, 78 years) treated for unilateral CSDH in our department from 2014 to 2016 after exclusion of cases with CSDH following previous head surgery or missing postoperative imaging. Pre- and post-operative neuroimaging studies were subjected to computer-assisted volumetric analyses. CSDH composition and anatomy were assessed using a modified Nakaguchi classification.
   RESULTS: A total of 67.8% of the patients presented with neurologic deficits, and 51.4% were at least on 1 anticoagulant agent. Burr hole trephinations were performed in 94.7%. The median residual hematoma volume was 35.0 mL (44.1 mL including air). Surgical recurrences were seen in 17.8%. The median time to repeat surgery was 17 days, and 91.9% of recurrences occurred within 60 days. Recurrence rates varied between 36.4% (separated or trabecular subtypes and postoperative CSDH volume >= 35.0 mL) and 3.7% (all other subtypes and postoperative CSDH volume <35.0 mL). A neuroimaging proven cure could be documented in an estimated 90% of cases at 145 days after first surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative CSDH volume and the Nakaguchi classification subtypes proved the most powerful predictors of recurrence, cure, and the time to recurrence and cure. Although our results demonstrate the important impact of CSDH volume, composition, and anatomy, they also show that other so far unknown factors play a significant role as well.

AB OBJECTIVE: Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) will be associated with hydrocephalus in <= 13% of cases. Currently, very little data are available describing the actual etiologies and treatment options of NF1-associated hydrocephalus. We, therefore, have described our experience in treating NF1-associated hydrocephalus.
   METHODS: We completed a retrospective data analysis 1020 patients with NF1 treated at the Gilbert's Israeli International Neurofibromatosis Center during a period of 20 years. The patients presenting with, and treated for, related hydrocephalus were included. The clinical, radiological, and surgical data are presented.
   RESULTS: We included 22 patients (2.1% of the entire patient cohort), with 17 aged <19 years. Twenty patients had obstructive hydrocephalus. The most common etiologies included aqueductal or third ventricular obstruction, Of the 22 patients, 15 had underwent endoscopic procedures (14 third ventriculostomies) and 7 had undergone shunt procedures. The corresponding failure rates (including the need for additional cerebrospinal fluid procedures) were 60% and 71%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hydrocephalus in the context of NF1 been caused mostly by obstructive etiologies. A tailored treatment approach is recommended to address the specific etiology. Regardless of the treatment approach, a relatively high rate of failure has been described.

AB BACKGROUND: Tethered cord syndrome (TCS) refers to a clinical constellation of signs and symptoms associated with tension in the spinal cord and associated with pathologies related to abnormally low-lying conus medul-laris. As minimally invasive spinal operations have become more prevalent in the past decade, we applied expanding indications to selected intradural procedures, such as tethered cord release (TCR). We present the first series of minimally invasive muscle-sparing TCR in the pediatric population.
   METHODS: A retrospective review of the Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, neurosurgical database was conducted for patients who underwent TCR between 2010 and 2017. Charts were reviewed to determine the source of TCS and whether surgery was conducted in a minimally invasive fashion. To establish a cohort of control population, age-matched cases of open TCR were selected in the same. Exclusion criterion was non-fatty filum sources of TCS. The length of stay, operative time, estimated blood loss, and postoperative complications were recorded.
   RESULTS: Eleven patients underwent minimally invasive TCR. Mean age of the patients was 10.1 years. All patients underwent L4-5 tubular laminotomy and cord detethering by 2 pediatric neurosurgeons at Texas Children's Hospital. The average length of stay in the hospital was 2.6 days. The average operative time was 167 minutes and average estimated blood loss was 8.2 mL. Ten patients reported clinical improvement and 1 patient was lost to follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive TCR is a safe and represents a viable alternative to the open approach with advantages such as minimal estimated blood loss, shortened length of stay, and postoperative pain control.

AB BACKGROUND: Although endovascular coiling of unruptured aneurysms is widely accepted, the endovascular treatment of wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms remains one of the most challenging morphologies. Our purpose was to describe our experience with 24-month follow-up for the treatment of unruptured intracranial bifurcation aneurysms using the PulseRider (Cerenovus, New Brunswick, NJ).
   METHODS: This study is a single-center, single-arm registry performed under institutional review board control to evaluate efficacy and safety of the PulseRider. Patients with bifurcation aneurysms were identified and enrolled prospectively. Angiography immediately after treatment and at 6 months, and magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography at 12- and 24-month follow-up were retrospectively analyzed. A modified Rankin score was obtained prior to procedure, at discharge, and at 6-, 12- and 24-month follow-up visits.
   RESULTS: Eight patients with a mean age of 66 years were treated with the PulseRider. All patients had bifurcation aneurysms (2 anterior communicating, 2 carotid terminus, and 4 basilar apex). The aneurysm diameters ranged from 4.6 to 13.6 mm (mean 7.4 mm) with dome/neck ratio ranging from 1.4 to 2.2 (mean 1.6). In all cases, the PulseRider was successfully deployed. Complete occlusion was demonstrated at 6-month follow-up on 6 of 8 (75%), near complete occlusion in 1 of 8 (12.5%), and residual aneurysm in 1 of 8 (12.5%) patients. There was no change or recurrence on magnetic resonance angiography, nor clinical complication after the procedure through 24-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with 24-month followup demonstrated favorable efficacy in the treatment of intracranial wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms using the PulseRider.

AB BACKGROUND: The safety and effectiveness of endovascular mechanical thrombectomy in patients with acute vertebrobasilar occlusion (VBO) are debatable and undergoing evaluation. We report the clinical outcome and prognostic factors in a prospective cohort of acute ischemic stroke patients with VBO.
   METHODS: In total, 48 consecutive patients with acute VBO underwent mechanical thrombectomy using Solitaire. We analyzed clinical and imaging data and searched for predictors of good clinical outcome (modified Rankin scale score: 0-3).
   RESULTS: The median prethrombectomy National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 22.0. The median duration from symptom onset to recanalization was 493.5 minutes. A total of 35.4% of the patients received rescue therapy. Recanalization (modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction: 2b-3) was successful in all patients. Clinically relevant intracranial hemorrhage was observed in 2 patients. After 90 days, good outcomes were obtained in 27 patients. The baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, posterior circulation Acute Stroke Prognosis Early CT Score (pc-ASPECTS), anesthesia type, and posterior communicating artery (PComA) patency were significantly associated with outcomes at 90 days in univariate analysis. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that high pc-ASPECTS at admission and PComA patency were independent predictors of good outcome at 90 days.
   CONCLUSIONS: Up to 60.4% of the patients reached good outcomes after endovascular treatment and 35.4% of the patients received rescue therapy, suggesting that mechanical thrombectomy using Solitaire in patients with stroke with VBO is safe and effective and that rescue therapy is readily required and employed. High baseline pc-ASPECTS and PComA patency were associated with better outcomes after thrombectomy in these patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Endovascular coiling is generally considered as an effective treatment option for ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Increasing operator experience and quality of tools determined an improvement of endovascular cerebral aneurysms' treatment. However, procedure-related complications still occur.
   The purpose of this study is to report a series of rescue stenting procedures with the Neuroform Atlas (NA) opencell stent, for intraprocedural complications during coil embolization in patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms.
   METHODS: Between April 2016 and January 2018, 12 consecutive coil protrusions that occurred during ruptured aneurysms' embolizations were rescued using NA stenting together with tirofiban therapy.
   Follow-up was performed with initial magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) at 1 month and then MRA plus standard digital subtraction angiography at 11-13 months after the procedure.
   RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in 100% of patients. No NA stent delivery/deployment complication occurred. Initial MRA showed complete occlusion of the aneurysm, with evidence of blood flow into parent vessels in 12 out of 12 cases.
   At 11-13 months, MRA and digital subtraction angiography showed 10 complete occlusion cases and 1 partial occlusion case. At 2 months, 1 death occurred due to subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   CONCLUSIONS: The open-cell NA stent represents a rescue option for coil protrusion during endovascular treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms allowing regular restoration of blood flow and minimizing thromboembolic events.

TI Comprehensive Anatomic Assessment of Ipsilateral Pterional Versus

AB OBJECTIVE: Medially pointing aneurysms of the ophthalmic segment of the internal carotid artery (oICA) represent a neurosurgical challenge. Conventional ipsilateral approaches require internal carotid artery and optic nerve (ON) mobilization as well as anterior clinoidectomy (AC), all associated with increased surgical risk. Contralateral approaches could provide a better exposure of the superomedial aspect of the oICA, ophthalmic artery, and superior hypophyseal artery, sparing AC and internal carotid artery or ON mobilization. However, the microsurgical anatomy of this approach has not been systematically studied. In the present work, we exhaustibly analyzed the anatomic and morphometric characteristics of contralateral approaches to the oICA and compared them with those from ipsilateral approaches.
   METHODS: We assessed 36 ipsilateral and contralateral approaches to the oICAs in cadaveric specimens and live patients, using for the latter a three-dimensional virtual reality (VR) system.
   RESULTS: Contralateral approaches spared sylvian fissure dissection and required only minimal frontal lobe retraction. The ipsilateral and contralateral oICA were found at a depth of 49.21 +/- 1.8 mm (VR, 50.1 +/- 2.92 mm) and 65.1 +/- 1.5 mm (VR, 66.05 +/- 3.364 mm) respectively. The exposure of the superomedial aspect of oICA was 7.25 +/- 0.86 mm (VR: 6 +/- 1 mm) contralaterally without ON mobilization and 2.44 +/- 0.51 mm (VR, 2 +/- 1 mm) ipsilaterally even after AC. Statistical analysis showed that, for nonprefixed chiasm, contralateral approaches achieved a significantly higher exposure of the ophthalmic artery, superior hypophyseal artery, and the superomedial aspect of the oICA with its perforating branches (all P< 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Contralateral approaches may enable successful exposure of the oICA and related vascular structures, reducing the need for AC or ON mobilization. Systematic clinical/surgical studies are needed to further determine the effectiveness and safety of the approach.

TI A Hemodynamic Safety Checklist Can Improve Blood Pressure Monitoring in
   Patients with Acute Spinal Cord Injury
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Blood pressure; Checklist; MAP; Monitoring; Spinal cord injury
ID TRAUMA; MANAGEMENT
AB OBJECTIVE: The American Association and Congress of Neurological Surgeons recommended mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) in patients with acute spinal cord injury (SCI) should be 85-90 mm Hg for the first 7 days. We evaluated whether hemodynamic management differed between a primary-receiving and tertiary hospital in the first 24 hours for patients with acute SCI and assessed whether use of a checklist could improve hemodynamic management.
   METHODS: Observational review was performed of 79 patients with acute SCI before and after introduction of a blood pressure monitoring checklist and staff educational program designed to improve tertiary center management. Hemodynamic management in the primary-receiving hospital was compared with the tertiary center before and after checklist introduction.
   RESULTS: At the primary-receiving center, mean number of documented MAP readings/hour was 2.2 and 3 before and after checklist introduction. The proportion having >50% of MAP recordings <80 mm Hg was 26% and 22%. The proportion having >50% of MAP recordings <70 mm Hg was 8.5% and 7%. At the tertiary center, mean number of MAP readings/hour was 1.3 and 2.7 before and after checklist introduction (P = 0.02). The proportion having >50% of MAP recordings <80 mm Hg decreased from 36.5% to 16% after checklist introduction (P = 0.05). The proportion having >50% of MAP recordings <70 mm Hg decreased from 9% to 5.5% (P = 0.6). Polytrauma, inotrope use, and head injury significantly correlated with low MAP recordings (P < 0.05). Polytrauma was an independent risk predictor for low MAP recordings (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Achieving MAP targets for patients with acute SCI is challenging. Checklist use and staff education were associated with improved hemodynamic management. Presence of polytrauma identified patients at particular risk.

   Trauma: Not Prophylactic or Necessary
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DE Spine fractures; Surgical drains; Surgical site infections; Trauma
ID SURGICAL SITE INFECTION; RISK-FACTORS; SURGERY; PREVENTION; GUIDELINE
AB BACKGROUND: Antibiotics after spine instrumentation are often extended while the surgical drain is in place, particularly for traumatic injuries. We sought to study if continuing antibiotics past 24 hours affected outcomes.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study of all patients who underwent spine fixation with hardware and surgical drains for trauma at our institution. We compared the effect of perioperative (<= 24 hours of antibiotics) versus prolonged (>24 hours) antibiotics on surgical outcomes. Bivariate and multivariable logistic and linear regression statistics were performed
   RESULTS: Three hundred and forty-six patients were included in the analysis. On multivariate analysis, antibiotic duration >24 hours did not predict surgical site infection (odds ratio, 2.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-8.10, P = 0.08) or mortality (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.10-3.44; P = 0.56).
   CONCLUSIONS: Continuing antibiotics past 24 hours after traumatic spine instrumentation was not associated with improved outcomes. A prospective study to verify these findings may be warranted.

ID CEREBRAL-ARTERY ANEURYSMS; CLASSIFICATION; OCCLUSION; UPDATE
AB BACKGROUND: We describe the Hook technique enabling coil embolization in unfavorable M1 bifurcation aneurysms and analyze the morphologic variations in M1 bifurcation to evaluate how often such aneurysms can be seen.
   METHODS: Among 42 MCA aneurysms treated by stent-assisted coil embolization, aneurysms arising at the acute-angled hypoplastic M1 branch (n = 14) were treated by the Hook technique, in which a short stent was deployed only to protect the aneurysm neck after micro-catheter selection of the hypoplastic M2, followed by subsequent coiling of the aneurysm. Outcome was evaluated, including Raymond classification, coil packing density, final modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and recurrence. Separately, 100 middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation aneurysms were analyzed to assess the proportion of such unfavorable aneurysms.
   RESULTS: Procedural success of the Hook technique was obtained in 13 of 14 patients (93%). A mean packing density of 30% was achieved. Magnetic resonance angio-graphic follow-up at a median 4 months (range, 1-26 months) showed complete occlusion in 11 patients and residual neck filling in 3 patients. There was no clinical event (mRS = 0) over a median 17 months (range, 2-26 months) of clinical follow-up. One patient had a thrombotic occlusion during the procedure, which was resolved after tirofiban infusion, without evidence of an infarct or deficit. Of the 100 MCA bifurcation aneurysms, aneurysm arising in asymmetric hypoplastic M2 division was the most common type (48%).
   CONCLUSIONS: The Hook technique enabled stent-assisted coiling of M1 bifurcation aneurysm with extension along the asymmetric hypoplastic M2 division and also securing the M2 branch.

AB OBJECTIVE: Ventriculoperitoneal shunt infections are common and result in significant morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditure. The objective of this study was to create an evidence-based perioperative shunt infection prevention protocol and analyze its efficacy by comparing the incidence of shunt infection before and after implementation at one institution.
   METHODS: A perioperative ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery protocol was developed based on a systematic literature review with the goal of reducing infection rates. Patients undergoing shunt surgery at Upstate Medical University Hospital, from before and after implantation of the perioperative shunt surgery protocol, were retrospectively analyzed and compared. Retrospective data collection included shunt infection incidence as a primary outcome and clinical features of patients from both cohorts.
   RESULTS: The pre-protocol and post-protocol cohorts included 226 and 285 patients, respectively. Twenty (8.8%) pre-protocol shunt infections and 16 (5.6%) post-protocol shunt infections were identified (P = 0.156). The relative risk of shunt infection between cohorts was 0.97 (95% confidence interval: 0.92-1.02).
   CONCLUSIONS: Although shunt infection rates pre-protocol and post-protocol were not significantly different, a trend toward fewer shunt infections was observed with protocol implementation. Suboptimal compliance at our institution may have limited assessment of protocol efficacy. Similar future studies may benefit from objectively assessing protocol compliance.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 develop bilateral vestibular schwannomas with progressive hearing loss. Auditory brainstem implants (ABIs) stimulate hearing in the cochlear nuclei and show promise in improving hearing. Here, we assess the impact of ABI on hearing over time by systematically reviewing the literature and re-analyzing available individual patient data.
   METHODS: A multidatabase search identified 3 studies with individual patient data of longitudinal hearing outcomes after ABI insertion in adults. Data were collected on hearing outcomes of different sound complexities from sound to speech using an ABI +/- lip reading ability plus demographic data. Because of heterogeneity each study was analyzed separately using random effects multilevel mixed linear modeling.
   RESULTS: Across all 3 studies (n = 111 total) there were significant improvements in hearing over time from ABI placement (P < 0.000 in all). Improvements in comprehension of sounds, words, sentences, and speech occurred over time with ABI use + lip reading but lip reading ability did not improve over time. All categories of hearing complexity had over 50% comprehension after over 1 year of ABI use and some subsets had over 75% or near 100% comprehension. Vowel comprehension was greater than consonant, and word comprehension was greater than sentence comprehension (P < 0.0001 in both). Age and sex did not predict outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: ABIs improve hearing beyond lip reading alone, which represents baseline patient function prior to treatment, and the benefits continue to improve with time. These findings may be used to guide patient counseling regarding ABI insertion, rehabilitation course after insertion, and future studies.

AB BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke is a devastating condition resulting in significant morbidity. Mechanical thrombectomy is now standard for large vessel occlusive stroke. Neuroinflammation is known to play important roles in ischemic stroke. Our aims were to examine our thrombectomy procedures and preliminarily examine systemic immune response in relation to thrombectomy changes.
   METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on mechanical thrombectomy cases from July 2011 through December 2015. Primary outcomes were time to recanalization, final Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score, procedural complications, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale improvement, and changes in white blood cell (WBC) count.
   RESULTS: One-hundred and twenty-nine procedures performed. We found a significant difference between WBC count on admission and WBC count post thrombectomy day 1 for patients with >90 minutes to recanalization (P = 0.006107). There was a positive association between WBC change and absolute National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale change among females (P = 0.0273) but not among males.
   CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found that systemic immune response has close relationships with speed of recanalization and preliminarily may shift differently on the basis of sex.

AB BACKGROUND: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a cause of dementia that can be reversed when treated timely with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion. Understanding CSF dynamics throughout the development of hydrocephalus is crucial to identify prognostic markers to estimate benefit/risk to shunts.
   OBJECTIVE: To explore the cerebral aqueduct CSF flow dynamics with phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a novel rodent model of adult chronic communicating hydrocephalus.
   METHODS: Kaolin was injected into the subarachnoid space at the convexities in Sprague-Dawley adult rats. 11.7-T Bruker MRI was used to acquire T2-weighted images for anatomic identification and phase-contrast MRI at the cerebral aqueduct. Aqueductal stroke volume (ASV) results were compared with the ventricular volume (VV) at 15, 60, 90, and 120 days.
   RESULTS: Significant ventricular enlargement was found in kaolin-injected animals at all times (P < 0.001). ASV differed between cases and controls/shams at every time point (P = 0.004, 0.001, 0.001, and <0.001 at 15, 60, 90, and 120 days, respectively). After correlation between the ASV and the VV, there was a significant correlation at 15 (P = 0.015), 60 (P = 0.001), 90 (P < 0.001), and 120 days. Moreover, there was a significant positive correlation between the VV expansion and the aqueductal CSF stroke between 15 and 60 days.
   CONCLUSIONS: An initial active phase of rapid ventricular enlargement shows a strong correlation between the expansion of the VV and the increment in the ASV during the first 60 days, followed by a second phase with less ventricular enlargement and heterogeneous behavior in the ASV. Further correlation with complementary data from intracranial pressure and histologic/microstructural brain parenchyma assessments are needed to better understand the ASV variations after 60 days.

AB BACKGROUND: Concerns exist that neurosurgery might fail to lead the field of endovascular surgical neuroradiology (ESN), as other specialties are allowed to train and practice ESN. This study aimed to assess the current breakdown of specialties and their relative academic productivity in accredited ESN fellowship programs.
   METHODS: A list of fellowship programs was obtained from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and Committee on Advanced Subspecialty Training directories. Primary specialty (i.e., residency) training for each faculty member in these programs was determined using information provided by the programs. A bibliometric search was performed for each member using Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA). Cumulative and ESN-specific h indices were calculated; h indices were compared between each specialty group and between international medical graduates and US medical graduates, regardless of specialty training.
   RESULTS: Thirty-one ESN fellowship programs with 88 faculty members were included. Neurosurgeons constituted 61.4% (n = 54) of the total ESN faculty, followed by radiologists with 30.7% (n = 27), and neurologists with 7.9% (n = 7). The mean ESN-specific h index for neurosurgery-trained ESN faculty was 16.2 +/- 14.6 compared with 14.4 +/- 10.9 for radiologists and 13.0 +/- 12.6 for neurologists (P = 0.76). There were 12 IMGs and 76 USMGs. The mean ESN-specific h index was greater for IMGs than USMGs, 24.7 +/- 14.3 versus 14.0 +/- 12.7 (P = 0.008), respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgery is leading the ESN field in numbers; however, the h index is not significantly different among ESN faculty based on primary training. The number of IMGs is relatively small, yet IMGs have significantly higher mean h indices.

AB OBJECTIVE: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) often is encountered in patients with high-grade gliomas. The un-derlying mechanisms are unclear, as is the optimal prophylactic protocol. The purpose of the present study was to identify risk factors of VTE and examine the validity of early VTE detection in high-grade gliomas.
   METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 165 patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma treated at Niigata University Hospital during the years 2009 to 2016. If the serum D-dimer levels increased to 5.0 mu g/mL or more, computed tomography was performed to detect VTE. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry with antibodies against podoplanin was performed on available 101 tumor tissues.
   RESULTS: Of the 165 patients, 44 (26.7%) developed VTE. Of the 44 patients, 34 (79.5%) developed VTE within 7 days after surgery. No fatal VTE occurred and major complications secondary to anticoagulation occurred in only 2 (1.2%) patients. On multivariate analysis, lower Karnofsky Performance Scale status, podoplanin expression, and isocitrate dehydrogenase-wildtype status were independently associated with the risk of VTE (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: We found that most VTEs occurred early in the postoperative period and commonly in patients with lower Karnofsky Performance Scale status and isocitrate dehydrogenase-wildtype gliomas, which expressed podoplanin.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy and feasibility of one-stage surgical treatment for consecutive multisegment thoracic spinal tuberculosis with kyphosis by posterior-only debridement, interbody fusion, and instrumentation.
   METHODS: Sixty-two patients who underwent posterior debridement, interbody fusion, and instrumentation were reviewed for radiographic fusion, region kyphosis, neurologic status, and clinical outcomes. Thoracic Cobb's angle and Frankel grading system were used to assess kyphosis and neurologic improvements, respectively. Operation time, blood loss, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, visual analogue scale score, and postoperative complications were recorded to evaluate efficacy and feasibility.
   RESULTS: The surgery duration was 234.5 +/- 91.3 minutes, with blood loss of 761.3 +/- 598.5 mL. The levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein in all patients decreased gradually to normal within 3 months after the surgery. Kyphosis angle was corrected from 16.9 +/- 10.9 degrees preoperatively to 10.4 +/- 6.3 degrees postoperatively (P < 0.001, t = 5.2) and remained at 12.0 +/- 6.6 degrees at final follow-up (P < 0.001, t = 4.6). Twenty-seven patients obtained neurologic improvement by 1-3 grades. The average visual analogue scale score decreased from preoperative 3.7 +/- 1.0 to postoperative 0.7 +/- 0.9 (P < 0.001, t = 16.4), and then to 0.5 +/- 0.3 at final follow-up (P < 0.001, t = 21.5). All patients achieved bony fusion. Recurrence of tuberculosis was not found in all patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: One-stage posterior surgery of debridement, interbody fusion and instrumentation could serve as an efficient way to cure patients with consecutive multisegment thoracic spinal tuberculosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Dysfunction of endothelial cells (ECs) constitutes a critical factor in the formation of intracranial aneurysms (IAs). However, little is known about the response of ECs to hemodynamic insults and its contribution to IA formation.
   METHODS: IAs models were constructed in both adult female New Zealand white rabbits and male Sprague-Dawley rats. Morphologic changes of vessel wall were detected by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Molecular and cellular changes, including p120-catenin (p120ctn) and vascular endothelial- cadherin, in the median sagittal section of the artery bifurcation were analyzed by fluorescent staining.
   RESULTS: Destructive aneurysmal remodeling and the formation of morphologic IAs were observed at the basilar termini of experimental rabbits and the anterior cerebral artery-olfactory artery bifurcation of rats. The expression of p120ctn colocalized with vascular endothelial - cadherin in ECs decreased. Moreover, the expression of p120ctn colocalized with nucleus of ECs increased. These events suggested that p120ctn was transported from the membrane to the nucleus of ECs.
   CONCLUSIONS: The potential mechanism, that IAs are always localizing in the bifurcation apices, may be that the endothelium injury of vessel wall can be induced by different hemodynamic conditions. Hemodynamic changes in artery bifurcation may initiate the formation of IAs.

AB OBJECTIVE: The prognosis of patients with breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) was dismal and the prognoses varied according to different prognostic factors. In this study, we used the SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) database to identify prognostic factors with the BCBMs.
   METHODS: We identified and built a robust prognostic model and developed reliable nomograms to estimate the individualized overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) of patients with BCBM. A total of 789 patients with newly diagnosed BCBM were identified from the SEER database and randomly divided into training (n = 554) and testing (n = 235) cohorts. The log-rank tests and the Cox proportional hazards model were applied to evaluate the prognostic effects of multiple clinicopathologic variables on the survival of training cohorts. Significant prognostic factors were combined to build the nomograms that were evaluated using the concordance index and calibration plots for internal and external validations.
   RESULTS: Two nomograms shared the common prognostic indicators including age, tumor subtype, chemotherapy, surgery, number of metastatic sites except the brain, and median household income. In the training cohort, the Harrell concordance index for the constructed nomogram to predict OS and BCSS was 0.668 and 0.676, respectively. The calibration plots were consistent between nomogram-predicted survival probability and actual survival probability. These results were reproducible when nomograms were applied to the testing cohort for external validation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Nomograms that predicted 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year OS and BCSS for patients with newly diagnosed BCBM with satisfactory performance were constructed to help physicians in evaluating the high risk of mortality in patients.

AB OBJECTIVE: To describe the operative methods and to investigate the efficacy of ventral neural decompression under microscopic vision with oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF).
   METHODS: Twelve patients with extruded or sequestered disk were treated with ventral neural decompression under microscopic vision via the working corridor of routine OLIF Their clinical data were gathered and analyzed retrospectively. The clinical efficacy was evaluated by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), visual analog scale (VAS), and relevant radiographic parameters.
   RESULTS: All operations went smoothly, with average operative time of 151.7 +/- 24.5 minutes and blood loss of 58.5 +/- 21.3 mL. Well-decompressed canal observed in postoperative magnetic resonance imaging, significant improvements in VAS score for leg (P< 0.01) and ODI score (P < 0.01) confirmed satisfactory ventral neural decompression. Radiographic parameters including disk height (P< 0.01) and segmental disk angle improved significantly (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference between pre- and postoperative lumbar lordosis (P = 0.255). During the follow-up, end plate fracture was observed in 1 case. No major vessels, neural, or dural injury was observed.
   CONCLUSIONS: Microscopic ventral neural decompression with OLIF could achieve satisfactory clinical results with minimal complications in selected patients with extruded or sequestered disk.

   METHODS: Neural stem cells (NSCs) isolated from newborn rats were induced and differentiated into GABAergic neurons.

The effects of grafting on spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) were examined and hippocampal GABA content was measured after grafting.
   RESULTS: In the GABA group, the frequency of electroencephalography decreased significantly compared with the PBS group (P< 0.001), but there was no significant difference between the GABA group and NSCs group. Compared with the PBS group, the overall frequency and duration of SRS significantly decreased in the transplantation group, especially in the GABA group (P< 0.01). The number of GABAergic neurons was highest in the GABA group compared with the other groups (P < 0.001). Furthermore, hippocampal GABA concentrations significantly increased in the GABA group.
   CONCLUSIONS: We show that GABAergic neurons generated in vitro from NSCs and grafted into the hippocampi of chronically epileptic rats can significantly reduce the frequency of electroencephalography and frequency and duration of SRS via increasing GABA-associated inhibition mediated by the addition of new GABAergic neurons.

AB BACKGROUND: In situations in which posterior atlanto-occipital fixation might not be possible or might require supplemental fixation, anterior fixation might add stability in obtaining arthrodesis. The present study aimed to provide a radiographic evaluation of the safety and feasibility in the anterior approach.
   METHODS: The bilateral craniocervical computed tomography slices of 60 patients were examined. The anterior screw entry point was the lowest point at the middle anterior aspect of C1 (atlas) lateral mass. To avoid hypoglossal canal and craniocerebral injury, the height of the hypoglossal canal and occipital condyle and occipital condyle width were obtained. The mandible occlusion angle (MOA), anterior screw trajectory above, under, and distal to the hypoglossal canal (AHA, UHA, and DHA) relative to the tangent line of C1 front border were measured, together with the maximum screw length under each angle (AHL, UHL and DHL). An independent samples t test was used for statistical analysis.
   RESULTS: The height of the hypoglossal canal and occipital condyle and occipital condyle width were all larger in the men than in the women. The MOA, AHA, UHA, and DHA were 55.0 degrees , 18.7 degrees , 41.0 degrees, and 55.0 degrees, respectively, and were similar between genders. The AHL, UHL, and DHL were 34.5, 30.9, and 31.3 mm, with the measurements for the men generally longer than those for the women by 3-4 mm. A total of 10 of 120 bilateral measurements showed the possibility of mandible occlusion, and the potential success rate of the anterior approach could reach 91.7%.
   CONCLUSIONS: The ideal entry angle for anterior atlanto-occipital fixation ranges from 41.0 degrees to 55.0 degrees, with a safe screw length from 30.9 to 31.3 mm. The potential success rate could reach >90%.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare one-time accuracy rate between simulated freehand (SFH) and navigation simulated (NS) pedicle screw insertion, assuming no second chance to correct screws.
   METHODS: A simulated, comparative, cross-sectional study was conducted on 69 patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery. An intraoperative registration system captured the planned point of entry and trajectory of pedicle screws for both SFH under direct visualization and NS under navigation-aided visualization. Pedicle screw insertion was simulated for each captured image (370 screws) using Surgimap. Rajasekaran's method helped evaluate the point of entry accuracy and trajectory.
   RESULTS: Accuracy rate was better for the NS method than for the SFH method (63.8%). Of 370 screws in the SFH group, 134 penetrated the cortex, with 31 resulting in >4 mm penetration. Of 370 screws in the NS group, 8 penetrated the cortex, <4 mm penetration. Of 134 misplaced screws in the SFH group, 64 were due to error in the point of entry, 63 were due to error in the trajectory angle, and 7 were due to both errors. Of 8 errors in the NS group, 7 were due to the point of entry.
   CONCLUSIONS: lntraoperative navigation had significantly better one-time accuracy of pedicle screw insertion than freehand insertion and should be used to avoid injury to the pedicle and surrounding tissue from screw reinsertion.

ID SURGERY
AB OBJECTIVE: We aimed to discuss the surgical strategies, safety and clinical efficacy of percutaneous endoscopic transforaminal decompression for the treatment of patients with migrated lumbar disc herniation.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective study. From May 2014 to April 2017, a total of 56 patients (32 men and 24 women) with migrated lumbar disc herniation were operated on by percutaneous endoscopic decompression via transforaminal approach. All enrolled patients had clinical symptoms with radiculopathy, and were identified as single-level, soft herniated disc by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical efficacy were evaluated chiefly by leg pain visual analogue scale score, Oswestry disability index score, and modified MacNab criteria.
   RESULTS: Patients were all successfully treated by percutaneous endoscopic transforaminal decompression, with an mean operation time of 63 +/- 12 minutes. The patients were followed up for a mean duration of 15 +/- 2.7 months (range 12-18 months). The leg pain visual analogue scale score was dropped from 8.2 +/- 1.9 preoperatively to 2.4 +/- 1.5, 2.2 +/- 1.3, and 1.8 +/- 1.1 at 1, 6, and 12 months after the operation, respectively. Similarly, the Oswestry disability index score was also decreased from 62.4 +/- 8.2 preoperatively to 18.4 +/- 6.2, 12.6 +/- 5.1, and 9.2 +/- 3.4 at 1, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. There were 38 excellent cases, 13 good cases, and 5 fair cases by the assessment method of modified MacNab criteria at 12 months after the operation, with an excellent and good rate of 91.07%. Two cases were complicated with low extremity numbness, which were recovered by conservative treatment in 3 weeks. No persistent neurological deficit or infection occurred in this group postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: We consider that percutaneous endoscopic decompression via transforaminal approach provided a safe, effective and minimally invasive alternative for the treatment of patients with migrated lumbar disc herniation.

AB OBJECTIVE: Cranioplasty is a technically simple procedure intended to repair defects of the skull to provide protection after craniectomy, improve functional outcomes, and restore cosmesis. Several materials have been used for the restoration of skull defects, including autologous bone grafts (AGs), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) flaps, and titanium mesh (T-mesh). However, the long-term results of cranioplasty after use of these materials are controversial.
   METHODS: Medical records of 596 patients who underwent cranioplasty at our medical center between 2009 and 2015 with at least 2.5 years of follow-up were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to the materials used: AG, three-dimensional PMMA, and T-mesh. Demographic and clinical characteristics and postoperative complications were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Cranioplasty with AG had the highest bone flap depression rate (4.9%; P = 0.02) and was associated with a 26% long-term bone flap resorption. Younger age was a risk factor for bone flap resorption. T-mesh had a higher risk of postoperative skin erosion and bone exposure (17%; P = 0.004). Patients with diabetes, previous craniotomy, or hydrocephalus showed a higher risk of postoperative skin erosion. PMMA was associated with the highest rate of postoperative infection (14.4% <3 months, 28.1% >3 months; P < 0.05), and previous craniotomy may increase the infection risk after cranioplasty with PMMA.
   CONCLUSIONS: Complications after cranioplasty are high, and the various types of cranioplasty materials used are associated with different complications. Surgeons need to be aware of these potential complications and should choose the appropriate material for each individual patient.

AB OBJECTIVE: The National Cancer Database (NCDB) and the SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) program are the 2 largest cancer registries in the United States. However, considerable differences exist between them regarding the sampling frame as well as the participating facility characteristics. In this study, NCDB and SEER are compared for primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors with the aims of discussing the implications for researchers and evaluating the generalizability of both databases.
   METHODS: Patients with primary CNS (brain and spinal cord) tumors from 2004 to 2013 were identified using the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition topographic codes. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and treatment-related variables were compared between the 2 databases using standardized differences, with values >0.1 denoting statistical significance.
   RESULTS: A total of 588,534 primary brain tumor (NCDB, 416,162; SEER, 172,372) and 34,827 primary spinal cord tumor (NCDB, 26,602; SEER, 8225) cases were identified. We found significant differences regarding age (sd. diff., 0.16 for brain; 0.13 for spinal cord), and Hispanic origin (sd. diff., 0.34 for brain; 0.61 for spinal cord). For NCDB and SEER patients, estimated 5-year overall survival was 59% and 64%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of 623,361 patients with primary CNS tumors, which are identified using both the NCDB and SEER databases, showed significant differences in age, histopathologic classification of tumors, tumor behavior, and treatment of tumors between 2 databases. Overall, the differences observed between 2 databases provide helpful points for the researchers who would like to use NCDB or SEER. These observations should be taken into account when researchers design studies using these databases and discuss the generalizability of their findings.

AB BACKGROUND: Recurrent stroke after surgical revascularization is still a big issue for moyamoya disease (MMD). This study aims to identify predictors for postoperative stroke and unfavorable outcome in ischemic-type MMD.
   METHODS: We identified a consecutive series of patients with ischemic-type MMD who underwent revascularization between January 2005 and December 2012. Predictors for postoperative stroke and functional outcomes were assessed with logistic and Cox regression analysis.
   RESULTS: A total of 346 patients underwent 437 revascularization procedures and the mean follow-up period was 4.0 years. The incidence of perioperative stroke was 6.9%. Being adult at onset (odds ratio [OR], 5.033; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.447-17.506; P = 0.011) and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) stenosis (OR, 3.364; 95% CI, 1.588-7.265; P = 0.002) before surgery were predictors of perioperative stroke. The annual subsequent stroke rate beyond 30 days after surgery was 1.2%. Subsequent stroke events tended to occur throughout the first 5 years after surgery in adults, whereas in children they mainly occurred within the first 2 years after surgery. Age at onset (OR, 1.025; 95% CI, 1.003-1.048; P = 0.023), ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack at presentation (OR, 2.703; 95% CI, 1.062-6.875; P = 0.037), and PCA involvement (OR, 2.664; 95% CI, 1.462-4.854; P = 0.001) were associated with higher risk of overall postoperative stroke. PCA involvement (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.33-5.15; P = 0.005), internal carotid artery supraclinoid segment occlusion (OR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.27-6.03; P = 0.011), and older age at onset (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05; P = 0.033) were predictive of unfavorable outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ischemic-type MMD at an older age and more severe angiopathy might be at higher risk of recurrent stroke and unfavorable outcome after revascularization.

AB OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous full-endoscopic anterior cervical discectomy (PEACD) and posterior cervical foraminotomy (PCF) have been reported as effective treatments for the cervical spondylosis radiculopathy (CSR), but the biomechanical effects on the discs and facet joints of PEACD and PCF remain largely unclear. The purpose of this paper is to investigate and compare the biomechanical changes on cervical spine after PECAD and PCF procedures, thus providing evidences for surgeons to select a more appropriate approach.
   METHODS: An intact cervical C5-C6 digital model was constructed and then modified to obtain the PCF and PEACD models using finite element method. All the models were subjected to a 73.6N preload accompanied by a 1.8 Nm moment during flexion, extension, axial rotation, lateral bending. The range of motion (ROM), intervertebral disc pressure (IDP), facet joint contact area, and contact pressure were calculated under different loading conditions.
   RESULTS: The ROM of the PCF model changed slightly (0.28%), whereas that of the PEACD model increased significantly (20.49%) compared with intact model. The trend of IDP changes in these 2 surgical models were similar to ROM in the corresponding motion state. The contact pressure on the facet joint of the PEACD model increased by 20.53%, 33.38%, and 17.46% during extension, lateral bending, and axial bending, respectively, compared with the intact model, and the PCF increased by 33.53% and 16.16% during extension and lateral bending, respectively, whereas it decreased 0.97% in axial rotation. The facet joint contact area of the PCF model increased by 85.71%, 1.54%, and 2.17% during extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation, respectively, and the area of the PEACD model increased by 157.14% and 36.96% during extension and axial rotation, whereas it decreased by 13.85% during lateral bending.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first biomechanical finite element study comparing PEACD with PCF for the treatment of CSR. Our results showed that PEACD led to hypermobility with high IDP within the cervical segment undergone surgery, whereas the ROM and IDP changed slightly after PCF. The variations of the contact stress indicated that both procedures changed the transmission path of the force on the facet joint and may accelerate the degeneration of the facet joint. PCF may be a better choice for the treatment of CSR compared with PEACD.

ID SPONDYLITIS; DIAGNOSIS
AB OBJECTIVE: Differentiating pyogenic spondylitis (PS) and tuberculous spondylitis (TS) is challenging but critical in clinical practice. Accurate diagnosis and early treatment are crucial to preventing further progression of disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the best method for the diagnosis of spinal infection, but results remain imprecise; therefore, by comparing and analyzing the MRI findings of spinal infections, we intend to identify key distinguishing features between PS and TS, and with that establish a systematic scoring method to help clinicians.
   METHODS: The MRI features of 70 cases of spinal infection (32 cases of PS, 38 cases of TS), confirmed by pathology or clinical diagnosis, were retrospectively analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to analyze the diagnostic efficacy of the MRI parameter scores in PS and TS.
   RESULTS: Among the 70 cases, the average age was 54.5 years, and 43 were male. Sixteen parameters were significantly different between the PS and TS groups. We hypothesized that a diagnosis of PS could be made when the number of parameters characteristic of PS exceeded the number of parameters characteristic of TS, and vice versa. We randomly selected 70% (49 patients) of the 70 patients for analysis, and then validated in the remaining 30% (21 patients) of cases. Using 0.5 as the cutoff value, of the remaining 21 patients, the correct coincidence rate was 95.23%, sensitivity was 91.67%, specificity was 100%, false-positive rate was 0%, and false-negative rate was 8.3%. The MRI parameter scores of PS and TS were analyzed with the receiver operating characteristic; area under the curve was 1.00.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic scoring system of MRI parameters is helpful in differentiating PS and TS.

AB OBJECTIVE: Because of its vascular supply and neurovascular contents, the cavernous sinus (CS) is a challenging area to dissect in the setting of skull base tumors with intracavernous extension or invasion. In the present study, we report the clinical outcomes of 14 patients with tumors with CS invasion that were surgically treated using a direct transcavernous sinus approach for endoscopic endonasal resection of their intracavernous sinus tumors.
   METHODS: Fourteen patients had undergone surgery using a direct endoscopic endonasal transcavernous sinus approach. The pathologic entities included Knosp grade 3-4 pituitary adenomas (n = 8), meningioma (n = 3), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 2), and chondrosarcoma (n = 1). The indications, surgical technique, and outcomes are discussed.
   RESULTS: Gross total resection was achieved in 11 patients (78.6%). All patients experienced resolution or improvement of symptoms. One patient experienced a transient oculomotor nerve palsy, which had resolved within 2 months postoperatively. No other complications occurred. For those tumors that had been grossly resected, no recurrence developed in any patient (mean follow-up, 40.4 +/- 24.8 months; range 10-84).
   CONCLUSIONS: Depending on the space created by intracavernous sinus tumors, use of the transanterior wall for the CS approach in endoscopic endonasal surgery could adequately treat most patients in our case series. This approach provided good visualization of the CS and can be used to treat tumors with favorable outcomes and a low incidence of complications in appropriately evaluated patients.

AB BACKGROUND: The increase of intradiskal pressure on the upper segment resulting from intervertebral distraction after lumbar intervertebral fusion decreases intervertebral height and aggravates degeneration. However, the incidence rate and risk factors of the adjacent intervertebral disk height decrease phenomenon have not been studied. The purpose of this study was to identify the incidence rate and risk factors of the adjacent intervertebral disk height decrease phenomenon after single-level transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) of the lumbar spine.
   METHODS: A retrospection of 68 patients who underwent L4-5 TLIF. Patient age, sex, and body mass index were collected. Lumbar lordosis, facet sagittalization, Pfirrmann classification, L4-5 distraction height, and L3-4 reduction height were evaluated by radiologic image. The patients were divided into 2 groups based on whether their L3-4 intervertebral height decreased.
   RESULTS: Forty of 68 patients (58.8%) had L3-4 interver-tebral height decrease. The patients' mean age was 62.05 +/- 10.90 years in the L3-4 interver-tebral height decrease positive (IHDP) group, significantly higher than the 56.14 +/- 12.06 years in the L3-4 intervertebral height decrease negative (IHDN) group (P = 0.039). The mean facet sagittalization angle in the IHDP group was 67.5 degrees +/- 20.36 degrees , significantly larger than the 55.43 degrees +/- 14.97 degrees in the IHDN group (P = 0.010). The preoperative lumbar lordosis was significantly higher in the IHDP group (P = 0.049). No significant effects of other factors on L3-4 height decrease were observed (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Distraction of the L4-5 intervertebral space by cage insertion leads to a reduced height on the adjacent 13-4 segment in some patients. In addition, the decrease in 13-4 intervertebral height resulting from L4-5 distraction was correlated with age, preoperative lumbar lordosis, and facet joint sagittalization.

AB Vipera palaestinae is responsible for many venomous incidents in the Middle East. However, this species is not included in the antigenic pool of venoms for the production of the regionally available polyvalent antivenoms. In an attempt to develop a potential complementary altemative therapy for snakebite patients, this study is investigating the antagonistic effect of Eryngium creticum against V. palaestinae venom. In this context, the concentration of the venom as well as the electrophoretic profile, and the venom LD50 were determined by intraperitoneal injection (ip). The methanolic leaf extract was prepared, and its safety on rats was examined. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 8 groups (n = 6); G1-G3 were injected subplantar in the right hind paws with 2.5, 3.125, and 3.75 mg kg(-1) then 200 mg kg(-1) extract ip. G4-G6 were given the same venom dose with no extract, respectively. Controls were G7 that only had the extract ip, and G8 that was injected subplantar with PBS. The swollen paws were measured at Hour 0 (before injection), Hour 1, Hour 6, and Hour 24. IL-6 and TNF-alpha were measured in serum using ELISA. Histopathological changes were examined in paw sections. The pooled venom concentration was 176.93 +/- 35.81 mg ml(-1) revealed 10 protein bands (5-80 kDa), and the LD50 via ip rout was 6.56 mg kg(-1). Paw edema peaked at Hour 1. At Hour 6, edema in G1 was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) compared to G6, while at Hour 24 there was no significant difference between all groups including the controls. Treated animals in G1-G3 expressed IL-6 significantly lower (p < 0.001) than untreated G4-G6, respectively. Levels of TNF-alpha in G1 and G2 were significantly (p < 0.001) lower than G3-G6, while G5 and G6 were significantly (p < 0.001) higher than G1-G4. Histopathological changes showed intensifying edema, hemorrhage, and inflammation with incrementing venom doses. Sections from treated animals expressed less adverse changes compared to untreated animals. Together, the outcomes are encouraging future utilization of E. creticum as a supportive remedy for snakebite cases.

AB Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is an important pathogen that can cause serious public health problems. Currently, therapeutic drugs for toxoplasmosis present serious side effects, researches on more effective and novel substances with relatively low toxicity are urgently needed. Spider venoms comprise diverse novel pharmacological compounds. However, the anti-T. gondii activity of spider venoms remains largely unknown. This study was carried out to evaluate the anti-parasitic effect of spider venoms from Ornitoctonus huwena (HWVM) and Chilobrachys jingzhao (JZVM) against T. gondii tachyzoites in vitro and in vivo. Cytotoxic activity of HWVM and JZVM to HeLa cells was determined by MTT cell viability assays. Low doses (3.125, 6.25 and 12.5 mu g/mL) of HWVM and JZVM displayed low toxicity to HeLa cells. Trypan blue exclusion assay indicated that either of HWVM and JZVM affected the viability of tachyzoites in a time-dependent manner. Both spider venoms inhibited the invasion and proliferation of tachyzoites in vitro (p < 0.05). Moreover, Mice treated with HWVM after infection with 2 x 10(3) T. gondii tachyzoites showed a better survival rate than mice treated with saline alone (p < 0.05), while mice treated with JZVM did not. Our findings indicate that HWVM is a promising agent for the treatment of toxoplasmosis.

AB Almonds and peanuts are a rich source of proteins, vitamins and unsaturated fatty acids. However, they can be also contaminated by mycotoxigenic fungi; a reason that has enhanced to investigate efficient strategies of management of these fungal contaminations. Some Lactic acid bacteria have been proven capable of inhibiting growth and mycotoxin production in livestock and transform it into nontoxic derivatives. In this work, four lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were tested for their abilities to inhibit the growth and mycotoxin production of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus carbonarius. Antifungal activity was evaluated in agar medium as well as in almonds and peanuts. Results showed that LAB significantly inhibited Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus carbonarius in agar medium but none of the strains were able to completely inhibit fungal growth. The highest fungal growth inhibition was obtained using L. kefiri FR7 (51.67% and 45.56% growth inhibition of A. flavus and A. carbonarius, respectively). The cell-free supernatants (CFS) from LAB reduced fungal growth with average growth inhibitions ranging from 13.33% to 40.56% and 12.78% to 37.78% for A. flavus and A. carbonarius, respectively. We noted also that cell-free supernatants at pH7 (CFS-pH7) from the entire tested LAB did not inhibit fungal growth. L. kefiri FR7 was the most effective strain in mycotoxin suppression with a reduction percentage reaching 97.22%, 95.27% and 75.26% for AFB1, AFB2 and OTA respectively. Moreover, the inoculation of L. kefiri FR7 in almonds artificially contaminated with A. flavus decrease 85.27% of AFB1 and 83.94% of AFB2 content after 7 days of incubation. On the other hand, application of L. kefiri FR7 in peanuts artificially contaminated with A. carbonarius reduced OTA content to 25%. Our study revealed the potential use and application of L. kefiri FR7 in the control of fungi growth and mycotoxins production in almonds and peanuts.

AB Scars can have a dramatic impact on patients' physical appearance and function. Injection of botulinum toxin has been used to prevent scar formation at the site of injury and to remodel scars that have already formed. The purpose of this review is to assess the safety and efficacy of botulinum toxin for scar management compared to placebo or no treatment.
   MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and PubMed Central were searched. Nine randomized controlled trials comparing injections of botulinum toxin versus placebo or no treatment for individuals of any age with scars were included and were assessed by two independent review authors. Cochrane risk of bias was used to assess trial quality, sensitivity analyses was conducted and trial sequential analysis was employed to assess the risk of random error. Mean difference (MD), standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% CI were calculated for continuous outcomes. Risk ratios (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for all dichotomous outcomes.
   The MD for the Vancouver scar scale (VSS) was -0.87 (95%CI, -1.73 to -0.02), and for the visual analogue scale (VAS) was 1.30 (95%0, 1.05 to 1.54). The SMD for scar width was -1.05 (95%Cl, -1.29 to -0.81). The safety of botulinum toxin therapy was evaluated by calculating adverse events and complications (RR 0.36; 95%CI, 0.09 to 1.45).
   Evidence from this study has documented the clinical benefits of botulinum toxin versus placebo or no treatment in the prevention and remodeling of scars. Injection of botulinum toxin is both safe and effective. Future studies should focus on the different doses needed and differences in effects between pre-surgical and post-surgical injection periods.

AB Bites by Micrurus snakes in Brazilian Amazon represent about 0.4% of snakebite registered in that area. There is not information available about the M. annellatus snakebites In this report, we describe a case of envenoming caused by Micrurus annellatus bolivianus recorded in the municipality of Cruzeiro do Sul, state of Acre, western Brazilian Amazon. On admission, the patient was suffering from mild pain, mild edema and paraesthesia restricted to the site of the bite, darkened vision and nausea. Laboratorial evaluation revealed unclottable blood which improved only after 3 days of follow-up. Envenoming was classified as moderate, and 50 ml of antielapid serum was administered. The next day after the incident, vital signs were normal and the patient had mild thrombocytopenia (133,000/mm3). The patient did not present any bleeding during the hospitalization. On the fourth day after admission, the patient was discharged alleging no complaints. The patient showed coagulopathy, a rare condition in cases of Micrurus bites. Some areas where there is a lack of knowledge on coral snakebites are listed in this manuscript.

AB A comparative venom proteomic analysis of the Brazilian southern coral snake, M. frontalis, the Amazon coral snake M. spixii spixii, and the aquatic coral snake M. surinamensis is reported. Venoms from M. frontalis and M. s. spixii were composed mainly (> 90% of the total venom proteome) by 3FTxs and PLA(2)s in different proportions, and minor proteins from 2 to 5 protein families. Conversely, the aquatic coral snake expressed a streamlined (95%) 3FTx venom with low abundance (4.2%) of PLA(2) molecules. A compositional-lethal activity for natural prey correlation analysis suggests that M. surinamensis venom may has evolved under strong pressure to quickly immobilize aquatic prey. On the other hand, venoms from M. frontalis and M. s. spixii, whose diet consist mainly of amphisbaenians and colubrid snakes, may have been shaped through balancing selection. Our work provides strong evidence for the occurrence in M. frontalis venom, but not in those from M. s. spixi and M. surinamensis, of a KUN-PLA(2) complex homologue to heterodimeric venom toxins from some long-tailed monadal coral snakes that target acid-sensing receptors ASIC1 a/2 evoking pain. The M. frontalis protein would represent the first example of a KUN-PLA(2) heterodimer in a South American short-tailed triadal coral snake venom.

AB 'Go Slow myopathy' (GSM) is a suspected toxic myopathy in dogs that primarily occurs in the North Island of New Zealand, and affected dogs usually have a history of consuming meat, offal or bones from wild pigs (including previously frozen and/or cooked meat). Previous epidemiological and pathological studies on GSM have demonstrated that changes in mitochondrial structure and function are most likely caused by an environmental toxin that dogs are exposed to through the ingestion of wild pig. The disease has clinical, histological and biochemical similarities to poisoning in people and animals from the plant Ageratina altissima (white snakeroot). Aqueous and lipid extracts were prepared from liver samples of 24 clinically normal dogs and 15 dogs with GSM for untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Group-wise comparisons of mass spectral data revealed 38 features that were significantly different (FDR < 0.05) between normal dogs and those with GSM in aqueous extracts, and 316 significantly different features in lipid extracts. No definitive cause of the myopathy was identified, but alkaloids derived from several plant species were among the possible identities of features that were more abundant in liver samples from affected dogs compared to normal dogs. Mass spectral data also revealed that dogs with GSM have reduced hepatic phospholipid and sphingolipid concentrations relative to normal dogs. In addition, affected dogs had changes in the abundance of kynurenic acid, various dicarboxylic acids and N-acetylated branch chain amino acids, suggestive of mitochondrial dysfunction.

AB After a snakebite accident, species identification is of vital importance. However, the existence of intraspecific differences in the body coloration patterns of venomous snakes can generate confusion and delay a convenient and effective treatment. This is the situation for Porthidium lansbergii lansbergii from Colombia, for which two distinctive color morphs occur, and the relationship of these morphs with venom toxicity is unknown. Therefore, venom samples from specimens of these two morphs were collected from the Colombian Caribbean region, and their protein profiles compared. Likewise, their venom functional activities were evaluated in vitro and in vivo in BALB/C mice. Additionally, using sequences of the mitochondria] cytochrome b (Cyt-b) gene, the relationship between these Colombian P. lansbergii lansbergii morphotypes was investigated, and their phylogenetic positions were determined for the first time using Bayesian inference. Despite the noticeable coloration divergence between the individuals analyzed, similar protein profiles of their venoms were observed. Additionally, neither their lethality nor biochemical activities were notably different. In general, both venoms were highly proteolytic, lacked a coagulant effect in vitro, and extended the clotting time due to the action of venom components, such as disintegrins and proteases, that induce defibrination. These results agreed with the result of our phylogenetic analysis, suggesting that the two chromatic morphs do not represent isolated populations. The phylogenetic analyses also supported the currently recognized P. lansbergii lansbergii subspecies as a monophyletic complex. In conclusion, the results of this investigation suggest similar clinical manifestations regardless of body coloration after a P. lansbergii lansbergii envenomation, and pools can therefore be used for antivenom development, medical treatments, and further research efforts.

AB The amelioration of aflatoxicosis in ducklings was examined by feeding molecular imprinted polymer (MIP) synthesized to target the aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) analog molecule [5, 7-dimethoxycoumarin (DMC)] as a smart and novel toxin binder in comparison to a commercial toxin binder (CTB). MIP was characterized with some techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) that showed morphology and thermal resistance of MIP, respectively. The SEM showed that more pores and big cavities were formed in the network of the MIP. TGA plots of MIP showed dehydration at temperatures of about 31 degrees C-200 degrees C and gradual decomposition until 300 degrees C. The in vitro and in vivo ability of MIP and CTB to adsorb some minerals (Ca, Cu, Mg, P and Zn) was evaluated. The in vivo efficacy of MIP as an aflatoxins (AFs) binder in duckling exposed to aflatoxin-contaminated feed from 4 to 18 d of age was also compared to that of the CTB. A total of 240 4-d-old ducklings were assigned to experimental diets. Each diet was replicated four times with 10 birds in each pen, and the initial body weight classes were considered as blocks. The experimental treatment diets included: 1-Control (basal diet without any additive or AFs), 2- MIP (5 g/kg diet), 3- CTB (5 g/kg diet), 4- AFs (0.2 mg/kg diet), 5- AFs + MIP (0.2 mg/kg + 5 g/kg diet), and 6- AFs + CTB (0.2 mg/kg + 5 g/kg diet). In vitro study may clearly reflect the possibility of adsorbing minerals by CTB as compared to MIP whilst the results were not confirmed by in vivo study and it seems that reduction in plasma levels of minerals is related to the adverse effects of AFs. Livers showed histopathological alterations, with bile-duct proliferation of all aflatoxin fed ducklings. Macroscopic study indicated liver of birds fed diets containing AFs showed abnormal signs including yellowish, friable and rounded shape without protective effect of MIP and CTB. The results obtained from in vivo study indicate the partial alleviation of the adverse effects of AFs in ducklings by dietary supplementation of MIP and CTB (5 g/kg) on plasma albumin, Zn, Mg and Ca.

AB Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is a freshwater phytoplanktivorous fish species reported to accumulate and tolerate large amounts of cyanotoxins such as microcystins (MCs). The present study aimed to investigate molecular responses to the acute exposure of Nile tilapia to the Microcystin-LA analogue (MC-LA). Thus, the specimens were sublethally exposed to 1000 mu g kg(-1) of MC-LA for 12, 24, 48, and 96 h. Gene expression of PP1, PP2A, GST, GPX and actin was analyzed by quantitative PCR. The protein abundance profile of PP2A was determined by immunoblotting, while the integrity of its biological function was assessed by a phosphatase enzymatic assay. PP2A activity was significantly and strongly reduced by MC-LA. A resulting feedback mechanism significantly increased PP2A gene expression and protein abundance in all assessed times. However, a recovery of that phosphatase activity was not observed. In this study, the observed increase in GPX gene expression was the only response that could be directly related to the unknown factors associated to the fish survival to such high dose exposure.

AB Introduction: North Central Florida is the home to several venomous snakes. The most clinically significant pit vipers include the Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake, the Water Moccasin, and less commonly the Timber Rattlesnake. Many of the dogs and cats that become envenomated by these particular snakes have moderate to severe clinical signs requiring the use of antivenom in doses that can range from 1 to 20 vials with the average case requiring two vials. Oftentimes, the pet owners' financial limitations restrict the amount of antivenom that can be administered initially to severely envenomed cases. Most of these patients will become clinically stable after the first 48 hours of treatment, but there are rare instances where some patients will follow this same initial course, and then revert back to the initial signs of envenomation associated with delayed absorption of redistributed venom from other tissue sites in addition to the bite site. This report describes three dogs that showed signs of persistent and/or recurrent envenomation requiring additional doses of antivenom.
   Methods: The medical records of three dogs showing signs of persistent envenomation were reviewed by the author who was available and provided assistance during the course of the dogs' respective hospitalizations. The dog's signalment, time of year of the envenomation, clinical signs, treatment, and outcome are provided in each case.
   Results: Each of these three dogs showed severe signs of envenomation characterized by marked mental depression, prostration, hemorrhagic lymphedema, and evidence of prolonged coagulation times. Initial treatment in each consisted of intravenous crystalloid solution and polyvalent crotalid antivenom that exceeded the usual average dose as reported in the literature. After the coagulation test normalized during the first three days, all of them reverted to abnormal prolonged clotting times with signs of clinical deterioration requiring additional doses of antivenom. Clinical stability was eventually reached and all dogs survived to be discharged.
   Conclusions: The clinical course of the three dogs described in this study showed that veterinary patients can experience persistent envenomation in a similar manner as described in humans. It behooves the veterinary practitioner to be aware of this complication and to be prepared to extend antivenom treatment as deemed necessary.

AB The present study evaluated the hepatoprotective role of ethanol extract of P. integrifolia leaves (EEPL) on aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-induced toxicity in mice. Mice were administered with AFB1 (0.1 mg/kg b. wt., orally) for 90 days, EEPL (400 and 600 mg/kg b. wt., orally) and silymarin (100 mg/kg b. wt., orally) in combination with AFB1. The study shows the protective effect of EEPL by the restoration of altered hematological indices and liver marker enzymes. Restoration of lipid peroxidation and glutathione content, along with activities of antioxidant enzymes, suggest amelioration of oxidative stress in AFB1-intoxicated mice. In addition, EEPL attenuated apoptosis and histopathological alterations in liver tissue. In conclusion, the current study suggests that EEPL protect mice liver against AFB1 toxicity by inhibiting oxidative stress and apoptosis. The protective activity of EEPL may be due to the enrichment of flavonoids (neohesperidin, apigenin-7-O-glucoside, catechin hydrate, cyanidin chloride, quercetin-3-galactoside, diosmin, genistein, malvin chloride, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid, kaempferol-3-O-alpha-L-arabinoside, myricitrin, poncirin, vitexin and tiliroside) in the extract as identified by UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS.

AB Sleep is a fairly diverse and complex construct to operationalize in a scientific and naturalistic context. We report a systematic review and meta-analysis of reviews published in the last 5 years on poor sleep and developmental outcomes. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 42 articles (or 1117 studies) qualified. They reported outcomes related to poor sleep investigated as sleep disorders (38.1%), sleep 'in general' (26.2%), sleep duration (23.8%), in terms of circadian rhythm (4.8%), intra-individual variability (2.4%), and napping (2.4%). Sleep was primarily subjectively reported (30.2%), yet the methodology of sleep assessment was often neither tabulated nor discussed. Overall, most papers had a health-scope, being primarily weight problems expressed as body mass index. Its relationship with performance was measured with the Wechsler intelligence tests, the child behavior checklist and the continuous performance test, whereas meta-analytic papers specifically focused on cognition with sleep disorder (i.e. sleep-disordered breathing; 38.6%), on health (i.e. weight) with sleep duration (25%) and behavior with sleep 'in general' (15.9%), having a high true variance. Nevertheless, an aggregated effect size d of 0.35 (95% confidence interval: 0.27-0.42) suggests that poor sleep is moderately affecting a child's performance and health.
   In conclusion, poor sleep can no longer be disregarded, yet methodologies that are more rigorous and a scope beyond health may foster a better understanding of the role of (poor) sleep across childhood neurodevelopment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Few studies on the relationship between sleep quantity and/or quality and cognition have been conducted among preschoolers from the healthy general population. We aimed to identify, among 3-year-old children, early polysomnography (PSG) sleep factors associated with estimated intelligence quotient (IQ) using the Weschler Preschool and Primary Scale Intelligence-III test (WPPSI-III) and its indicators: full-scale (FISQ), verbal (VIQ), and performance (PIQ) intelligence quotients.
   Methods: We included full-term children from the French birth-cohort AuBE with PSG recording at term (M0) and/or six months (M6), and available WPPSI-III scores at three years. Sleep and arousal characteristics of these infants were evaluated during day and night sleep periods. Relationships between IQ scores and sleep parameters were estimated using models with the child as a repeated effect adjusted for time (night/day), maturation (M0/M6), tobacco exposure (yes/no), anxiety-depressive scores during pregnancy, maternal age, duration of breastfeeding and child's gender.
   Results: A total of 118 PSG recordings were obtained, representing a total of 78 unique children (38 with one PSG and 40 with two PSG). No correlations were found between night and day sleep durations at M0 or M6. Mean VIQ, PIQ, and FSIQ scores were within normal ranges. In multivariate models, longer sleep duration and higher sleep efficiency during the day were negatively associated with all IQ scores. More frequent arousals during the night were associated with lower VIQ scores.
   Conclusion: Early sleep characteristics such as night sleep fragmentation or longer naps could be associated with impaired cognitive function at three years of age. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Sleep problems, neuro-developmental development, and sleep-disordered-breathing (SDB), are reported as more prevalent in premature infants than in full-term infants. We investigated the relationship between neuro-development, and SDB in preterm infants at 24 months corrected age (CA) with a narrow palatal presentation over time.
   Methods: We enrolled infants 40 weeks or younger at birth collecting obstetric and birth data. Participants were followed up at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months CA. We evaluated craniofacial development by inspecting and photo documenting hard palate; sleep using sleep diary, actigraphy and night-time polysomnography-PSG-; and development using Bayley-Scales-of-Infant-Development and Denver-Developmental-Screening-Test (DDST) at each visit and comparing results at six months and two years.
   Results: 244 premature infants [139 (57.0%) boys, [at birth: mean gestational age-GA- 31.5 +/- 3.2 weeks, 1691.9 +/- 593.9 g, 40.2 +/- 5.2 cm], and 30 full term infants (50% boys), [mean GA 39.3 +/- 1.0 weeks, 3131.0 +/- 390.0 g, and 49.38 +/- 2.0 cm] were enrolled in the study. At 6 and 24 months, 65.2% premature infants had a narrow hard palate (NHP). At 24 months, 79% had an apnea-hypopnea-index (AHI) > 1 events/hour at PSG, with a mean AHI of 3.00 +/- 2.95. Only 10% of full term infants had NHP at birth and the mean AHI was 0.5 +/- 0.2 event/hour at 24 months.
   Conclusion: Preterm infants have a higher occurrence of NHP at birth. At two years of age they have more sleep problems, most commonly associated with obstructive-SDB, and a higher rate of development delays. Frequency of NHP is still abnormally high, suggesting not only abnormal orofacial growth over-time, but also impact of this abnormal growth in the genesis of the obstructive-SDB.

AB Objective: Prior to sleep onset in human adults, distal body temperatures change progressively from wakefulness levels (low skin temperatures and a high core temperature) to sleep levels (high skin temperatures and a low core temperature) due to distal skin vasodilation and greater body cooling. It is not known whether this sleep preparedness exists in preterm neonates, even though sleep has a key role in neonatal health and neurodevelopment. The present study's objectives were to determine whether sleep preparedness (as observed in adults) can be evidenced in preterm neonates, and to assess repercussions on thermal stress.
   Methods: During a 12-h night-time polysomnography session, skin temperatures (recorded with an infrared camera), sleep, and wakefulness episodes were measured in 18 nine-day-old preterm neonates.
   Results: Fifteen wakefulness episodes were considered. Our results highlighted significant pre-sleep distal skin vasodilation (mainly at the foot: an increase of 0.38 degrees C in the 20 min preceding sleep onset) for the first time in preterm neonates. This vasodilation occurred even though (1) most factors known to influence pre-sleep vasodilation in adults were not present in these neonates, and (2) the neonates were nursed in a nearly constant thermal environment. The vasodilatation-related increase in body heat loss corresponded to a 0.15 degrees C/h fall in mean body temperature (calculated using partitional calorimetry).
   Conclusion: Compensation for this body heat loss and the maintenance of body homeothermia would require a 4% increase in metabolic heat production. In neonates, this type of energy expenditure cannot be maintained for a long period of time. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   PRESSURE; APNEA; NASAL; CHILDHOOD; OBESITY
AB Objective: To characterize sleep-disordered breathing patterns not related to hypoxia resulting in fragmented sleep in children.
   Methods: We reviewed the polysomnogram (PSG) data of children with sleep complaints who were being evaluated for sleep-disordered breathing and had an apnea-hypopnea-index <= 3. These data were compared to the recordings of the same children with nasal CPAP administered for one night and to 60 control subjects (children without any sleep complaints). A subgroup of children was monitored with esophageal manometry, but nasal cannula flow data was recorded in all cases.
   Results: Abnormal breathing patterns, particularly flow limitation, could be seen with more severity and frequency compared to apnea or hypopnea. The observed abnormal breathing patterns were associated with EEG disturbances.
   Conclusions: Patterns such as flow-limitation, mouth-breathing, changes in inspiratory and expiratory time, rib-cage and expiratory muscle activity, transcutaneous CO2 electrode changes and snoring noises are all variables that should be systematically reviewed when analyzing nocturnal PSG. Current scoring guidelines emphasizes apnea-hypopnea and hypoxic-sleep disordered breathing and therefore treatment is often much delayed in this population of children with evidence of abnormal breathing patterns. Analysis of the various patterns of abnormal breathing noted above allows recognition of "non-hypoxic" sleep-disordered-breathing (SDB). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   MANAGEMENT; ACCURACY
AB Background: Assessments of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are underutilized across Canada due to a lack of resources. Polysomnography (PSG) measures OSA severity through the average number of apnea/hypopnea events per hour (AHI), but is resource intensive and requires a specialized sleep laboratory, which results in long waitlists and delays in OSA detection. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of OSA are crucial for children, as untreated OSA is linked to behavioral deficits, growth failure, and negative cardiovascular consequences. We aim to assess the performance of a portable pediatric OSA screening tool at different AHI cut-offs using overnight smartphone-based pulse oximetry.
   Material and methods: Following ethics approval and informed consent, children referred to British Columbia Children's Hospital for overnight PSG were recruited for two studies including 160 and 75 children, respectively. An additional smartphone-based pulse oximeter sensor was used in both studies to record overnight pulse oximetry [SpO(2) and photoplethysmogram (PPG)] alongside the PSG. Features characterizing SpO(2) dynamics and heart rate variability from pulse peak intervals of the PPG signal were derived from pulse oximetry recordings. Three multivariate logistic regression screening models, targeted at three different levels of OSA severity (AHI >= 1, 5, and 10), were developed using stepwise-selection of features using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The "Gray Zone" approach was also implemented for different tolerance values to allow for more precise detection of children with inconclusive classification results.
   Results: The optimal diagnostic tolerance values defining the "Gray Zone" borders (15, 10, and 5, respectively) were selected to develop the final models to screen for children at AHI cut-offs of 1, 5, and 10. The final models evaluated through cross-validation showed good accuracy (75%, 82% and 89%), sensitivity (80%, 85% and 82%) and specificity (65%, 79% and 91%) values for detecting children with AHI >= 1, AHI >= 5 and AHI >= 10. The percentage of children classified as inconclusive was 28%, 38% and 16% for models detecting AHI >= 1, AHI >= 5, and AHI >= 10, respectively.
   Conclusions: The proposed pulse oximetry-based OSA screening tool at different AHI cut-offs may assist clinicians in identifying children at different OSA severity levels. Using this tool at home prior to PSG can help with optimizing the limited resources for PSG screening. Further validation with larger and more heterogeneous datasets is required before introducing in clinical practice. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID RAPID MAXILLARY EXPANSION; PALATAL EXPANSION; COMPLICATIONS; BORNE;
   DISTRACTION; CHILDREN
AB Objective: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the results of an outpatient surgical procedure known as endoscopically-assisted surgical expansion (EASE) in expanding the maxilla to treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adolescent and adults.
   Methods: Thirty-three patients (18 males), aged 15-61 years, underwent EASE of the maxilla. All patients completed pre- and post-operative clinical evaluations, polysomnography, questionnaires (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] and Nasal Obstruction Septoplasty Questionnaire [NOSE]) as well as cone beam computed tomography (CBCT).
   Results: With EASE, the overall apnea hypopnea index (AHI) improved from 31.6 +/- 11.3 to 10.1 +/- 6.3. The oxygen desaturation index (ODI) improved from 11.8 +/- 9.6 to 1.8 +/- 3.7, with reduction of ESS scores from 13.4 +/- 4.0 to 6.7 +/- 3.1. Nasal breathing improved as demonstrated by reduction of the NOSE scores from 57.8 +/- 12.9 to 15.6 +/- 5.7. Expansion of the airway from widening of the nasal floor was consistently evident on all postoperative CBCT; the anterior nasal floor expanded 4.9 +/- 1.2 mm, posterior nasal floor expanded 5.6 +/- 1.2 mm, and the dental diastema created was 2.3 +/- 0.8 mm. Mean operative time was 54.0 +/- 6.0 min. All patients with mild to moderate OSA were discharged the same day; patients with severe OSA were observed overnight. All patients returned to school or work and regular activities within three days.
   Conclusions: EASE is an outpatient procedure that improves nasal breathing and OSA by widening the nasal floor in adolescents and adults. Compared to current surgical approaches for maxillary expansion, EASE is considerably less invasive and consistently achieves enlargement of the airway with minimal complications.

   DIMENSIONS; CHILDREN; MORPHOLOGY; THERAPY
AB Introduction: Midface retrusion creates a size deficiency problem in the upper airway that has been improved in children using surgical midface advancement and orthopedic protraction of the maxilla. The results of these treatments have been mostly promising at enlarging the pharyngeal airway. Recently introduced bone anchored maxillary protraction (BAMP) uses implant inserted devices in the jaws to pull the maxilla forward against a backward pressure to the lower jaw. This is a pilot study that examines the use of BAMP as a strategy to treat maxillary retrusion, malocclusion and children with obstructive sleep apnea.
   Methods: 15 children, ages 9-16 years with maxillary retrusion creating a skeletal malocclusion were treated with bone anchored maxillary protraction (BAMP) and the results were compared against an untreated control group. 8 children in the treatment group also had sleep disordered breathing/obstructive sleep apnea. All subjects had lateral cephalograms before and after BAMP therapy. The OSA cohort completed the pediatric sleep questionnaire (PSQ) and polysomnography prior to and at the end of BAMP.
   Results: The majority of the OSA children (n = 5) showed improvement in their apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and OSA symptoms after BAMP. Preliminary results of BAMP therapy show improvement in respiratory and airway parameters in OSA children with a highly significant change in the forward position of the upper jaw and enlargement in the nasopharyngeal to oropharyngeal junction as compared to an age and sex matched untreated control group. The outcomes were dependent on the age of treatment initiation and patient compliance.
   Conclusions: This preliminary work suggests that bone anchored maxillary protraction may be considered as an adjunctive treatment option in adolescents for improving midface retrusion and sleep apnea, but further work is needed to explore this therapy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP-APNEA; CHILDREN
AB Backgrounds: Myofunctional therapy has been reported to be a valid adjunct treatment to OSA, but compliance was mentioned as an issue. We performed a prospective study on age matched randomized children submitted to myofunctional therapy (MFT) or to a functional device used during sleep (passive MFT).
   Methods: 110 children 4 to 16 were recruited for the study, 54 children were in the MFT group [A] while 56 were in the "nocturnal device" group [B]. Clinical evaluation, polysomnography and cephalometric X-Rays were performed at baseline, 6 months and 12 months, with clinical follow-up at 3 months.
   Results: MFT group show very important absence of compliance, at six months only 23 subjects participated and only 10/23 had been compliant with treatment. None came back for research investigation at 12 months. 48/56 of passive MFT children ended the research protocol at 12 months. Comparison of baseline to 6 and 12 months data showed that all children with passive MFT improved (PSG and cephalometrics) and had nasal breathing during sleep at 1 year, and no negative effect of device were noted. The 10 children compliant with MFT showed clear improvement of sleep related breathing with also changes at cephalometric -X-rays.
   Conclusion: Compliance is a major problem of MFT, and MFT will have to take into consideration the absolute need to have continuous parental involvement in the procedure. Passive MFT gives many more positive results, but potential negative effects of device on other jaw will have to be continuously evaluated. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID UPPER AIRWAY; ADENOTONSILLECTOMY; OUTCOMES; CBCT
AB Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the skeletal effects of rapid maxillary expansion (RME) therapy performed using teeth as anchors, in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) children, by low-dose computed tomography (CT) of the midpalatal suture opening, maxillary base width, nasal cavities width, first molar angulation and, unlike most studies in the literature, on the pterygoid processes distance.
   Methods: Fourteen children (mean age 8.68 years) with OSA presenting a malocclusion characterized by upper-jaw contraction had 16-Multislice CT (MSCT) scans taken before (T0) and after (T1) RME. All exams were performed using a rigid protocol to ensure reproducibility of image collection over time, with a 16-row MSCT scanner equipped with a Dentascan reconstruction program. Scanning parameters were as follows: scout view in the anteroposterior (AP) and laterolateral (LL); 1.25-mm slice thickness with 0.6-mm collimation from the dentoalveolar and basal areas of the maxilla up to the nasal cavity, parallel to the palatal plane; 80 kV, 100 mA with an 11.25-mm table speed/rotation, rotation time 0.6 s. Matrix size was 512 x 512.
   Results: Opening of the midpalatal suture was demonstrated in all cases. The results showed statistically significant T0 to T1 increments in all treated cases and clear imaging findings.
   Conclusion: Use of three-dimensional (3D)-CT for follow-up studies requires a very rigid protocol to maintain reproducible positions in the scanner over time. The images confirm the real remodeling of craniofacial structure. However, to be valid such an imaging approach needs great attention to reproducibility of anatomic images over time. The changes in volume of the UA, even with a rigid protocol, cannot be affirmed with 3D-CT. There is a need to improve the definition of markers using this imaging approach when performing longitudinal studies; currently this issue is unresolved. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Deficient sleep is highly prevalent in disadvantaged adolescents and contributes to a range of adverse health and behavioral outcomes. We examined mediating mechanisms and strategies that adolescents adopt to improve sleep, and possible levers for promoting sleep in this population.
   Methods: We conducted three focus groups (N = 27 total, age 14-18 years) in adolescents living in lowand middle-income racially/ethnically diverse neighborhoods of Boston, Massachusetts. Participants completed a survey on their sleep and health habits prior to the moderator-led discussions. Discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed.
   Results: The study population did not meet the minimum sleep recommendations, and we found a high prevalence of "social jet-lag." We also identified a disconnect between the acknowledgment of the importance of sleep and actual behavior, especially for electronic use. Phone use and screen time were the most commonly cited barriers to a good night's sleep, along with caffeine consumption, which was also high in this sample. There was also a general lack of awareness of sleep hygiene practices and recommendations. Participants reported regulating food intake and physical activity, using allopathic sleep aids, creating a comfortable sleeping environment, and a routine as some strategies to improve sleep.
   Conclusion: Results from this study suggest facilitating the linkage between participant-generated mediating factors and strategies for better-designed interventions. These include making the negative impact of sleep on health more explicit, improving youth awareness about sleep hygiene, targeting caffeine consumption and electronic use, and introducing sleep recommendations through appropriate and effective channels.

AB Objective: Later school start times for adolescents have been implemented in the US and associated benefits found, although no randomised controlled trials (RCT) have been undertaken. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of two school interventions in the UK, a delayed start time and a sleep education programme, on students' academic performance, sleep outcomes and health-related quality of life.
   Methods: The study had an RCT design to enable an investigation into the differential effects of two interventions or a combination of both: schools were to delay their start time to 10:00am and/or provide a classroom-based sleep education programme. The recruitment target was 100 state (non-fee-paying) secondary schools. Participants were to be students in Year 10/11 (14-16-year-olds).
   Results: Despite much media coverage, only two schools volunteered to take part in the RCT. The main challenges faced in recruitment fell under three categories: research design, school, and project-specific issues. The delayed start time and prospect of randomisation to this intervention were the overwhelming reasons cited for not taking part. Facilitators and barriers to research were identified. Recommendations include carrying out a feasibility study prior to a main trial, allowing adequate time for recruitment, involving stakeholders throughout the decision-making process, incorporating independent (fee-paying) schools in recruitment, focusing on students not taking important examinations or involving an older year group with greater independence.
   Conclusion: The Teensleep study provides supporting evidence that evaluating the effects of a change in school start times through an RCT is unfeasible in the UK. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: To investigate associations between sleep duration and health-related measures, and factors associated with short sleep, in adolescents in an East Asian society with strong emphasis on academic achievement.
   Methods: Adolescents aged 13-19 years (n = 2346) from eight schools in Singapore (five local, three international) took part in a cross-sectional survey of sleep habits, school life, and health. Self-rated health, overweight (International Obesity Task Force Criteria), and depression symptoms were compared in adolescents with short (< 7 h), moderately short (7 to < 8 h), or an appropriate amount of sleep (8-10 h) on school nights.
   Results: Short sleep on school nights was associated with poorer self-rated health, increased odds of being overweight (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj] = 2.56, 95% confidence interval = 1.39-4.70), and increased odds of feeling depression symptoms (sadness, irritability, worthlessness, low motivation, difficulty concentrating, anhedonia, anxiety, and thoughts of self-harm/suicide) compared with an appropriate sleep duration (ORadj = 2.10-4.33, p < 0.05 for each symptom). Barriers to healthy sleep included later preferred sleep timing (a relative indicator of later chronotype), lower parental supervision of bedtime, longer study time, early school start time, and longer travel time. Students at local schools were less likely to have a parent-set bedtime, and spent more time on homework/studying. Later bedtime in local schools attenuated the benefit of later school start time on nocturnal sleep duration.
   Conclusions: Short sleep may contribute to poorer adolescent health and well-being. Strategies for improving sleep in hard-driving East Asian societies should take into account sociocultural factors that may impede removal of barriers to healthy sleep. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Bedtime electronic media use and caffeine consumption are risk factors for insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality during adolescence, which are in turn risk factors for mental wellbeing. Our study tested the effectiveness of a brief school-based psychoeducative intervention to primarily increase sleep duration, by decreasing bedtime electronic media use and caffeine consumption. Secondary outcomes included improving sleep quality and difficulties, daytime tiredness, and mental wellbeing.
   Method: A pilot cluster-randomised controlled study was conducted involving a 25-min psychoeducative school-based intervention combined with parent information. 352 adolescents from seven schools participated (Intervention Group/IG = 192 students vs. Control Group/CG = 160 students; age: Mean = 15.09 years; SD = 1.65 years; Females = 163). The intervention included information on the importance of sleep and good sleep hygiene habits, particularly emphasizing behavioural rules of avoiding electronic media use at night and evening-time caffeine consumption. A leaflet containing the rules was also sent to parents of IG participants. Baseline and post-intervention sessions were held approximately four weeks apart.
   Results: Multilevel analyses revealed a significant but modest decrease in electronic media use for participants in the IG versus CG, but showed no effect on caffeine consumption or sleep duration. Moreover, the intervention did not impact any secondary outcome.
   Conclusions: Findings indicate the potential effectiveness of a short and easily administrable intervention to decrease electronic media use at night, which may be incorporated into school curricula and standardised for wider use in primary prevention. However, no further benefits of the intervention were found. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Children and adolescents who are referred to residential care facilities (RCFs) have a history of neglect, abuse, or other familial or environmental deficiencies, all of which may contribute to a higher risk of sleep problems. The purpose of this study was to explore sleep patterns of young adolescents living in RCFs and to examine whether these patterns are reflected in their self-figure drawings and accompanying narrative descriptions.
   Method: The study compared quantitative subjective (self-report) and objective (actigraphy) measurements of sleep patterns in young adolescents living in RCFs (n = 26) and at home (n = 33), and explored a quantitative indicators analysis of "self-figure drawing while sleeping" and qualitative analysis of accompanying narrative descriptions.
   Results: Adolescents in RCFs went to bed at least an hour earlier and woke up at least half an hour earlier than their home-residing counterparts (p < 0.001). Based on actigraphy, their sleep duration and sleep latency were longer (p < 0.01). They frequently drew themselves in a closed boundary, viewed from above, and used monochromatic colors. Analysis of the narratives revealed themes of exclusion, which reflect the need to exclude oneself from threatening and anxiety-provoking experiences.
   Conclusions: Adolescents in RCFs take longer to fall asleep; however, imposed early sleep schedules in RCFs enable good sleep hygiene practices that allow for longer sleep duration compared with homeresiding peers and can prevent additional sleep problems. The need for protection and a sense of security emerged from the drawings and the accompanying narratives. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: A case-control study was performed to test the hypothesis that children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have chronic sleep deprivation and may be classified into specific sleep-related phenotypes.
   Methods: Thirty outpatients with ADHD (nine females, mean age 10.1 +/- 2.1 years) were recruited consecutively, and given a comprehensive sleep assessment, including blood exams, sleep questionnaires, laboratory video-polysomnographic recordings (v-PSG), multiple sleep latency tests, and one-week actigraphy. The PSG parameters were compared to those of 25 age-matched controls (12 females, mean age 10.34 +/- 1.54 years) who underwent only the v-PSG.
   Results: ADHD children were classified as follows: a narcolepsy-like phenotype was found in four; delayed sleep onset insomnia in five; obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in 15; periodic limb movements in eight, and sleep epileptiform discharges in 10 children. All subjects had a total sleep time shorter than 9 h at actigraphy, ferritin levels lower than 60 mcg/L, and a history of sleep problems (mainly OSA and insomnia). Compared to controls, the ADHD group had a higher apnea-hypopnea index at PSG.
   Conclusions: A full sleep assessment in children with ADHD confirmed the validity of the sleep phenotypes hypothesis, and revealed a much higher percentage of sleep problems than that found in the literature. Beyond the sleep phenotypes, all children reported a history of sleep problems and slept less than 9 h per night, indicating chronic sleep deprivation that should be evaluated as a possible unifying marker of ADHD.

AB Objective/background: The purpose of this study was to examine the associations of diabetes management and sleep duration with glycemic control in youth with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
   Patients/methods: 111 participants (mean age = 13.59 +/- 2.11 years, 52.3% male, 50.5% non-white) wore actigraphy (average duration = 5.5 nights) and completed self-reported daily sleep diaries (average duration = 5.3 nights). Parents and participants each completed the Diabetes Management Scale (DMS) as part of a neurobehavioral evaluation. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and daily frequency of self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) were collected from patient medical records.
   Results: Youth with T1DM slept below the recommended amount of sleep for this age group (M = 7.45, SD = 0.74), which is approximately 9 h for school aged youth. They were in poor glycemic control with an average HbA1c of 9.11% (SD = 1.95) and their SMBG frequency was 4.9 (SD = 2.71). Average sleep duration from actigraphy was significantly correlated with average SMBG frequency and inversely related to HbA1c, indicating that less sleep was associated with worse management and glycemic control. When entered into a mediation model, diabetes management (SMBG frequency) completely mediated the relationship between sleep duration and glycemic control (HbA1c). Different sleep parameters of sleep quality, time to sleep, and sleep consistency also significantly correlated with HbA1c, SMBG, and parent and child-reports of various aspects of diabetes management. In particular, later bedtimes and a greater social jetlag predicted worse glycemic control.
   Conclusions: In a sample of sleep deprived and poorly controlled youth with T1DM, diabetes management was an intermediary factor between sleep duration and glycemic control. Additional analyses of data supported circadian influences on glycemic control. These results highlight the importance of addressing sleep duration, quality, and consistency as part of routine diabetes management in this population. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To determine associations among objectively-measured nocturnal sleep time, bedtime and obesogenic behaviors, including dietary intake, timing of intake, and physical activity, in a diverse sample of school-aged children who presented for behavioral treatment to enhance sleep duration.
   Methods: Eighty-seven children (8-11 y, 66.7% female, zBMI: 0.86 +/- 1.0) who self-reported sleeping < 9.5 h/night were studied for one week using wrist actigraphy to estimate sleep; hip-worn accelerometers to measure physical activity; and 24 h dietary recalls to capture dietary intake and meal timing. Pearson and Spearman's rho correlations and linear regressions controlling for age, gender and race were used for statistical analyses.
   Results and conclusion: Mean bedtime was 10: 31 PM (+/- 58.2 min) and mean nocturnal sleep time was 7.7 h (+/- 37.5 min). Although later bedtime was associated with shorter sleep time (r = -0.61, p < 0.001), the two variables were differentially related to obesity risk factors. Later bedtime, but not sleep time, correlated with greater daily fat intake, later first meal of the day, and greater after-dinner intake (all p < 0.05). Nocturnal sleep time, but not bedtime, correlated with zBMI (p = 0.04). Both sleep time and later bedtime were associated with a later last meal of the day (all p < 0.05). Findings remained consistent after controlling for demographic factors. In short-sleeping school-aged children, bedtime may be more predictive of dietary obesity risk factors whereas sleep duration may be more predictive of zBMI. Results suggest that health providers should consider both bedtime and sleep duration for reducing obesity risk in children. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The objective of this review was to evaluate the effect of mandibular advancement appliances (MAAs) for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children. To this end, several electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library) were systematically searched until 18 June 2018. Randomized and non-randomized clinical trials were included. Articles of high-quality were included for the meta-analysis. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted by two independent reviewers. Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and three non-RCTs were finally included in the review; of these, two RCTs of high-quality were included in the meta-analysis. The mean difference in apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) change for mandibular advancement group compared with control group was -1.75 events/h (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.07, -1.44), p < 0.00001. Sensitivity analysis including the quasi-randomized RCT and non-RCTs showed stable favorable results for MAAs.
   The meta-analysis showed supportive evidence for MAA treatment in pediatric OSA patients. Subgroup analysis suggested that MAA can be effective for mild to severe patients before the end of the pubertal peak. Long-term treatment (at least six months) may be more effective than short-term treatment. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: Depressed baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) is reported in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Improvement of BRS short-term after surgical treatment is also reported. We tested the hypothesis that surgical treatment not only improves clinical outcomes, but also improves BRS after 18 months.
   Methods: Cardiovascular autonomic tests, polysomnography (PSG), and biochemical testing were prospectively evaluated in 54 OSA patients at three time points (preoperatively, 6 months and 18 months postoperatively) and compared with 20, age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched, healthy controls.
   Results: The BRS increased after surgical treatment at 18-month follow-up, with results similar to the healthy control. Additionally, average O-2, mO(2) <90% (% per night), and lowest O-2 showed an increase after surgical treatment at the 18-month follow-up.
   Conclusions: Besides improvement in clinical outcomes, depressed BRS in OSA patients is reversible and these patients have the potential for total recovery of baroreflex function after 18 months of treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: We aimed to investigate the association between the use of various sedative-hypnotics and the incidence of overall and individual cancers in a large, population-based, retrospective cohort study.
   Methods: We selected a 5% random sample of individuals aged 50 years or older from data maintained by the Korean National Health Insurance Service for the years 2002-2015, excluding individuals with a prior diagnosis of cancer and with any sedative-hypnotic use in the initial two years of follow-up, leaving 236,759 participants for the final analysis. Exposure to sedative-hypnotics was defined by type of drug, standardized to a defined daily dose, and coded as a time-varying variable. Cox proportional hazard models were applied after adjusting for sex, socio-economic status, and comorbidities.
   Results: We observed increased risk for overall cancer among men and women who used sedative-hypnotics (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01-1.13 for men; HR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.09-1.25 for women) compared with non-users after full adjustment. In the fully adjusted model, women with any sedative-hypnotic use had significantly increased risk for thyroid (HR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.24-1.87), breast (HR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.04-1.61), ovarian (HR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.10-2.46), and lung cancer (HR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.17-1.69) compared with non-users. Men with sedative-hypnotic use had increased risk for prostate (HR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.16-1.58), brain (HR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.04-2.69), and lung cancer (HR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.07-1.35) compared with non-users.
   Conclusion: We found a significant increase in overall cancer incidence among participants who used sedative-hypnotics, and both male and female sedative-hypnotic users had significantly increased risk for certain types of cancer. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Sleep, which plays an important role in health and well-being, is socially patterned such that certain demographic groups have worse sleep health than others. One possible mechanism driving sleep disparities is social capital. The current study examines the association between social capital and self-reported sleep variables (eg, duration, insomnia symptoms, and daytime sleepiness) among a sample of 1007 participants from the Sleep Health and Activity, Diet and Environment Study (SHADES).
   Methods: Logistic regressions were used to estimate whether the sleep variables were associated with social capital measures. All models control for age, sex, race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White, Black/African-American, Hispanic/Latino, Asian, and multicultural/other), income, and education (less than high school, high school graduate, some college, and college graduate).
   Results: Lower likelihood of membership in groups was seen for long sleepers (>9hrs, p-value<0.05) and beliefs that neighbors rarely/never help each other was more likely among short sleepers (5-6hrs, p-value<0.05), relative to 7-8 h sleepers. A decreased sense of belonging was seen among short sleepers (5-6hrs, p-value<0.05). Decreased likelihood of trust was reported by those with moderate-severe insomnia (p-value<0.05). Similarly, neighborhood improvement efforts were less likely among individuals with moderate-to-severe insomnia (p-value<0.05).
   Conclusions: Results of our study show that short and long sleep duration, as well as insomnia, were inversely related to measures of social capital, such as group memberships and a sense of neighborhood belonging. Future research may explore the directionality of the relationship between social capital and sleep and perhaps consider future interventions to improve low social capital and/or poor sleep in community samples.

ID PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; SEDENTARY BEHAVIOR; LONG-SLEEP; CONSEQUENCES;
   RESTRICTION; DURATION; BENEFITS; PAIN
AB Objective/Background: It is widely established that insufficient sleep can lead to adverse health outcomes. Paradoxically, epidemiologic research suggests that individuals who report habitual nightly sleep greater than 9 h also are at risk for adverse health outcomes. Further, studies have shown that long sleepers have decreased activity levels, which may partially explain the relationship between long sleep duration and mortality. The influence of sleep extension (longer time in bed) on levels of daily activity has not yet been established. The current study examined whether a week of sleep extension altered activity levels within the subsequent daily waking active and sleep period in order to determine whether increased time in bed indeed is related to decreased activity levels.
   Methods: A total of 26 healthy volunteers wore wrist accelerometer devices (Actiwatch 2.0, Philips) in order to objectively measure sleep and activity for six days during their normal schedules and for six days during a sleep extension (10 h time in bed) intervention.
   Results: There were no significant or clinically-relevant differences in 24-h activity or activity during the active or sleep period between baseline and sleep extension conditions. There were no main or interaction effects of day and condition when daily activity counts were compared between baseline and sleep extension conditions for the 24 h period (Day: F-(5,F- 21) = 1.92, p = 0.12; Condition: F-(1,F-25) = 2.93, p = 0.09; Day by Condition: F-(5,F-21) = 0.32, p = 0.83), Active Waking Period (Day: F-(5,F-25) = 1.53, p = 0.18; Condition: F-(1,F-25) = 0.26, p = 0.61; Day by Condition: F-(5,F-21) = 0.55, p = 0.74) or Nightly Sleep (Day: F-(5,F-21) = 0.86, p = 0.51; Condition: F-(1,F-25) = 1.78, p = 0.19; Day by Condition: F-(5,F-21) = 0.79, p = 0.56) periods. In contrast, there was a main effect of condition when examining sleep duration by day between conditions (Day: F-(5,F-21) = 1.60, p = 0.16; Condition: F-(1,F-25) = 167.31, p < 0.001; Day by Condition: F-(5,F-21) = 2.31, p = 0.07), such that sleep duration was longer during the sleep extension condition.
   Discussion: Sleep duration increased during six days of a sleep extension protocol but activity levels remained similar to their baseline (normal) sleep schedule. The current findings suggest that extending time in bed alone does not alter waking activity counts in young healthy adults. The link between extended sleep and adverse health outcomes may be attributable to other phenotypic factors, or other biological correlates of extended sleep and poor health. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI Clinical phenotypes of obstructive sleep apnea after ischemic stroke: a
   cluster analysis
SO SLEEP MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Stroke; Obstructive sleep apnea; Cluster analysis; Cerebrovascular
   accident; Sleep-disordered breathing; Latent class analysis
ID RISK
AB Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent in patients with ischemic stroke. Untreated OSA is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and OSA treatment may improve neurological recovery in stroke survivors, yet OSA in stroke patients remains poorly characterized. The goal of this study is to identify clinical phenotypes of ischemic stroke patients with OSA.
   Methods: Participants (n = 451) with ischemic strokes and OSA (respiratory-event-index, (REI) >= 10/hour based on home sleep apnea testing) were identified from the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project. Latent class analysis was performed based on the following variables: age, sex, race/ethnicity, REI, pre-stroke snoring, pre-stroke tiredness/fatigue, pre-stroke sleep duration, prior stroke history, NIHSS at presentation, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and chronic heart failure.
   Results: A model with three phenotype clusters provided the best fit. Cluster 1 (n = 55, 12%) was defined by higher NIHSS scores. Participants in cluster 2 (n = 253, 56%) were younger and had relatively low NIHSS scores. Cluster 3 (n = 143, 32%) included participants with severe OSA and higher prevalence of medical comorbidities.
   Conclusion: Ischemic stroke survivors with OSA can be categorized into three clinical phenotype clusters characterized by differences in stroke severity, OSA severity, age and medical comorbidities. This highlights the heterogeneity of post-stroke OSA. Awareness of the different faces of OSA in patients with ischemic stroke may help clinicians identify OSA in their patients, and inform research concerning the pathophysiology, treatment and prognostic impact of post-stroke OSA.

AB Objective: to produce the Brazilian version of the Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) with evidence of reliability and validity.
   Method: The cultural adaptation was carried out in the following stages: translation, synthesis of translations, back-translation, evaluation by an expert committee and pre-test with 30 participants. Next, the psychometric properties were evaluated with 104 participants who answered the Brazilian version of the BQ and underwent polysomnography (PSG). They also completed a sociodemographic and clinical characterization instrument and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Reliability was assessed concerning homogeneity of the items (internal consistency), and criterion validity was tested by comparing the Brazilian version of the BQ with the apnea and hypopnea index (AHI) obtained through PSG.
   Results: The Brazilian version of the BQ presented evidence of semantic-idiomatic, conceptual and cultural equivalence, with good acceptability and feasibility. The findings demonstrated the reliability of the measure (Cronbach's alpha 0.74). The instrument presented a sensitivity of 81.3%, 86.2%, and 93.8%, and specificity of 82.5%, 54.7% and 50.0% for the risk stratification of obstructive sleep apnea according to the AHI >= 5, >= 15 and >= 30 events per hour, respectively. It should be emphasized that the BQ is a screening instrument for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and should be combined with a clinical evaluation and later confirmed with PSG.
   Conclusion: The Brazilian version of the Berlin Questionnaire was reliable and valid in the study population. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; SACCADE VELOCITY; PATHOLOGY; ABNORMALITIES; DISEASE;
   STAGE; SCA2
AB Background: Sleep spindles and K-complexes are electroencephalographic hallmarks of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep that provide valuable information into brain functioning, plasticity and sleep functions in normal and pathological conditions. However, they have not been systematically investigated in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA). To close this gap, the current study was carried out to quantify sleep spindles and K-complexes in SCA2 and to assess their relationship with clinical and molecular measures, as well as with memory and attention/executive functioning.
   Methods: In this study, 20 SCA2 patients, 20 preclinical carriers and 20 healthy controls underwent whole-night polysomnographic (PSG) recordings as well as sleep interviews, ataxia scoring and neuropsychological assessments. Sleep spindles and K-complexes were automatically detected during non-REM sleep stage 2 (N2). Their densities were evaluated as events/minute.
   Results: Compared to controls, sleep spindle density was significantly reduced in SCA2 patients and preclinical subjects. By contrast, K-complex density was specifically and significantly decreased only in SCA2 patients. Reduced spindle activity correlated with measures of verbal memory, whereas reduced K-complex activity correlated with age, ataxia severity and N3 sleep percentage in SCA2 patients.
   Conclusions: Findings document an impairment of N2 sleep microstructure in SCA2 already in prodromal stages, suggesting an early involvement of thalamo-cortical and/or cortical circuits underlying the generation of sleep spindles and K-complexes. Thus, sleep spindle density may serve as useful biomarker for deficits of neural plasticity mechanisms underlying verbal memory alterations in patients. It may also serve as promising outcome measure in further therapeutical trials targeting memory decline in SCA2. With regard to K-complexes, they have potential usefulness as marker of sleep protection. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID POLYSOMNOGRAPHY; VALIDATION; ACTIGRAPHY; VALIDITY
AB Objective/Background: Recent technological advances and emerging commercially-available consumer-friendly sleep assessment products affords researchers with a host of tools to consider for capturing free-living sleep in children. The purpose of this study was to compare free-living sleep characteristics (duration and bed/wake times) across different measures in children.
   Methods: Elementary school-aged children (N = 30, mean age 7.2 years, 63% boys, 87% non-Hispanic white) wore an ActiGraph GT9X Link (c) and Fitbit Charge HR (c) on the non-dominant wrist, with a Beddit 3 Sleep Monitor (c) affixed to their mattress for two consecutive weekend nights of free-living sleep. Parents completed a sleep log of bed and wake times. Absolute differences in bed and wake times were examined and Bland Altman plots assessed the level of agreement across sleep measures.
   Results: Across the four sleep measures, total sleep time (TST) ranged from 458 min/night (ActiGraph GT9X Link (c)) to 613 min/night (Parent report). Mean bed and wake times ranged from 8:46(PM) to 9:03(PM), and 6:52(AM) to 7:16(AM), respectively. Pearson correlation coefficients were moderate between all four sleep measures (range r = 0.30-0.71). Bland-Altman plots indicated the highest level of agreement for TST was between Beddit 3 Sleep Monitor (c) and Fitbit Charge HR (c) (mean difference -11.7, limits of agreement: 119.0, -142.4 min).
   Conclusions: The findings from this study show a high level of agreement of when a child goes to sleep and wakes up across a variety of sleep measures; however, more work is needed to classify TST once the sleep period has commenced. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Poor sleep poses negative health consequences for youth, yet few longitudinal actigraphy studies have examined basic developmental trends in sleep across adolescents' transition to young adulthood. In this longitudinal actigraphy study, stability of individual differences and trajectories of sleep during and after high school were examined. The degree to which sleep trajectories differed by college attendance status was also studied.
   Methods: A total of 343 youth with Asian, Latino, and European American backgrounds completed eight days of wrist actigraphy at two-year intervals in Wave 1 (n = 295, M-age = 16.39), Wave 2 (n = 211 including 34 new participants to refresh the sample, M-age = 18.31), and Wave 3 (n = 144, M-age = 20.29). Sleep duration, efficiency, and latency were estimated for weekdays and weekends. Intra-individual variability in duration across nights was also obtained.
   Results: Sleep parameters were correlated modestly between Wave 1 and Wave 2, but not correlated between Wave 1 and Wave 3, indicating modest shorter-term and little longer-term stability of individual differences. Multilevel growth models demonstrated declines in weekday sleep duration and efficiency across high school and post-high school years. Intra-individual variability in duration increased over the years. Latency trajectories changed more for non-college attendees compared with college attendees.
   Conclusions: Overall the findings suggest developmental trends of worsening sleep during adolescents' transition to young adulthood. Interventions to improve sleep may need to target specific issues faced by youth at that particular period in their lives. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Appropriate total sleep time is reported to be associated with several important health outcomes. However, the relationship between total sleep time and all cancer mortality is not well defined because of inconsistent results from published studies, and no dose-response meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the exact dose-response relationship.
   Methods: We conducted a literature search of PubMed and Web of Science to identify all relevant epidemiological studies published before August 9, 2018. We performed categorical and non-linear dose-response meta-analyses to quantify the association between total sleep time and all cancer mortality.
   Results: Finally, we included 14 cohort studies in the present meta-analyses enrolling 866,877 participants with 43,021 cancer deaths. We found that total sleep time less than seven hours was not significantly associated with increased risk of all cancer mortality [relative risk (RR) = 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.99-1.05]. However, four to five hours total sleep time was related to an 8% increased risk of all cancer mortality (RR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.02-1.13) in dose-response meta-analysis. Furthermore, long total sleep time (>= 8 hours) was weakly associated with all cancer mortality (RR = 1.05; 95% CI = 1.02-1.08). However, the increment in total sleep time longer than nine hours was notably associated with an increased risk of cancer mortality.
   Conclusion: The current meta-analysis provides evidence of a positive association between total sleep time of four to five hours and total sleep time longer than eight hours with the risk of all cancer mortality among the general population. Additional studies are needed to establish causality. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) has been associated with vascular diseases, including cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases. Among the various mechanisms in RLS, peripheral vascular endothelial dysfunction in patients with RLS has recently been proposed as a vascular pathophysiology of RLS. This study investigated arterial stiffness related to RLS in acute ischemic stroke patients and its influence on stroke outcome.
   Methods: RLS in patients with acute ischemic stroke was assessed based on the four essential criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group described in 2003. The patients' clinical and laboratory characteristics, arterial stiffness, small vessel disease occurrence, and burden on brain MRI were recorded. Stroke severity was determined using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and clinical outcomes were determined using the modified Rankin Scale.
   Results: Of 296 patients with acute ischemic stroke, 16 (5.4%) were diagnosed with restless legs syndrome. Logistic regression analysis showed that a 1 m/s increase in brachial arterial pulse wave velocity was associated with the diagnosis of RLS (odds ratio, 1.092; 95% confidence interval, 1.019-1.170, p = 0.012). Diagnosis of RLS in patients with acute ischemic stroke was associated with poor clinical outcome three months after stroke (modified Rankin Scale 3-6) (odds ratio, 4.263; 95% confidence interval, 1.229-14.792, p = 0.022) along with initial NIHSS score.
   Conclusion: RLS in patients with acute ischemic stroke is associated with increased arterial stiffness and poor clinical outcomes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The present study aimed to explore the interaction between work schedule (shift work versus non-shift work), genetic variability in SLC6A4 and insomnia symptoms.
   Methods: The study was based on a national probability sample survey of 987 Norwegian employees drawn from The Norwegian Central Employee Register by Statistics Norway. Insomnia symptoms were assessed by three items reflecting problems with sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and early morning awakenings. Genotyping concerning SLC6A4 (the 5-HTTLPR S versus L and the SNP rs25531 A versus G) was carried out using a combination of gel-electrophoresis and TaqMan assay.
   Results: Using the LALA genotype as a reference a main effect of the SS genotype (B = 0.179; 95% CI = 0.027-0.330) was found. In addition, a main effect of work schedule (0 = non shift, 1 = shift work) was found (B = 0.504; 95% CI = 0.185-0.823). The genotype x work schedule interaction was significant for all genotypes; SLA (B = -0.590; 95% CI = -0.954-0.216), LALG (B = -0.879; 95% CI = -1.342-0.415), SLG (B = -0.705; 95% CI = -1.293-0.117) and SS (B = -0.773; 95% CI = -1.177-0.369) indicating higher insomnia symptom scores among LALA-participants compared to participants with other genotypes when working shifts.
   Conclusions: The ability to cope with shift work is associated with the combination of the SLC6A4 variants 5-HTTLPR and SNP rs25531. Our findings demonstrated that the LALA-genotype increases the risk of insomnia symptoms among shift workers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The relationship between sleep quality and all-cause, CVD and cancer
   mortality: the Southall and Brent REvisited study (SABRE)
SO SLEEP MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Sleep quality; Cardiovascular; Mortality; Ethnic differences
ID DISTURBANCES; DURATION
AB Background: Both long and short sleep duration increase risk of mortality. Most previous studies have been performed in Europeans and have focused on sleep duration. Thus, we aimed to investigate the association between sleep quality and mortality across three different ethnic groups.
   Methods: We used data from the Southall and Brent REvisited Study (SABRE) cohort, which comprises first generation migrant South Asian and African Caribbean men and women, aged 40-69 years, recruited between 1988 and 1991. In sum, 4399 participants provided complete data at baseline and follow-up. Of those, 1656 died by December 2017. Our exposures (eg, difficulty falling asleep, early morning waking and waking up tired in the morning) were self-reported and our primary outcome was mortality. We used Cox proportional hazards models to analyse our data, adjusting for baseline-measured confounders.
   Results: None of the sleep measures were strongly associated with all-cause mortality in Europeans or African Caribbeans, whilst in South Asians difficulty falling asleep was related to an increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.01; 1.61). In Europeans, early morning waking was associated with a moderately increased risk of cardiovascular death (HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.05; 1.63); alternately, this association was not as strong in the other groups.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the relationship between sleep quality and mortality may differ by ethnic group, but formal heterogeneity tests indicated that the strongest difference in HRs was observed for early morning waking and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality across the three groups (Cochran's Q test p = 0.036). As such, these results are novel and provide support for ethnic differences in sleep quality and mortality, and may have implications for precision medicine. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: There is conflict between living according to our endogenous biological rhythms and our external environment, with disruptions resulting in negative consequences to health and performance. This is often documented in shift work and jet lag, but 'societal norms' (eg, typical working hours) can create profound issues for 'night owls', people whose internal biological timing predisposes them to follow an unusually late sleep-wake cycle. Night owls have also been associated with health issues, mood disturbances, poorer performance and increased mortality rates.
   Methods: This study used a randomized control trial design aimed to shift the late timing of night owls to an earlier time (phase advance), using non-pharmacological, practical interventions in a real-world setting. These interventions targeted light exposure (through earlier wake up/sleep times), fixed meals times, caffeine intake and exercise.
   Results: Overall, participants demonstrated a significant advance of similar to 2 h in sleep/wake timings as measured by actigraphy and circadian phase markers (dim light melatonin onset and peak time of the cortisol awakening response), whilst having no adverse effect on sleep duration. Notably, the phase advance was accompanied by significant improvements to self-reported depression and stress, as well as improved cognitive (reaction time) and physical (grip strength) performance measures during the typical 'suboptimal' morning hours.
   Conclusions: Our findings propose a novel strategy for shifting clock timing towards a pattern that is more aligned to societal demands that could significantly improve elements of performance, mental health and sleep timing in the real world. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Clay mineralogy and elemental geochemistry of Core S018401 on the Vietnam Shelf are used to reconstruct the history of weathering and erosion in central Vietnam over the past 13.2 ka. The variability of the clay species across the 13.2 ka BP together with the age model allows a subdivision into four temporal stages. Provenance analysis based on clay mineralogy indicates that small mountainous rivers in southern-central Vietnam are the major sources of terrigenous sediments on the central Vietnam Shelf. Smectite and kaolinite originated from the chemical weathering of Mesozoic and Neogene-Quaternary basaltic rocks and Paleo-Mesozoic felsic intrusive rocks, respectively, under warm and humid climate conditions; whereas illite and chlorite were mainly derived from physical weathering of Paleo-Mesozoic felsic intrusive rocks and Precambrian metamorphic rocks in central Vietnam. Accordingly, smectite/(illite + chlorite) ratio, together with elemental ratios of Al2O3/K2O, TiO2/Al2O3, and SiO2/Al2O3, can be utilized to reflect the relative importance between chemical weathering and physical weathering/erosion of the parent rocks in southern-central Vietnam. Higher smecdte/(illite + chlorite) and Al2O3/K2O ratios indicate a more important role of chemical weathering, and higher TiO2/Al2O3 and SiO2/Al2O3 ratios suggest enhanced contribution of physical weathering and erosion. A combination of these mineralogical and elemental proxies allows the distinction of four stages of weathering and erosion evolution in southern-central Vietnam over the Holocene and Younger Dryas periods. Enhanced physical weathering and erosion took place during the periods similar to 13.2-11.0 ka BP (Stage I) and similar to 3.9-2.0 ka BP (Stage III), associated with relatively arid conditions. By contrast, strengthened chemical weathering occurred during the periods similar to 11.0-3.9 ka BP (Stage II) and 2.0 ka BP to present (Stage IV), corresponding to more warm and humid climatic conditions. Our study suggests that the weathering and erosion history of southern-central Vietnam over the Holocene is mainly controlled by the East Asian monsoon climate.

AB Since the Ms 7.0 earthquake occurred in Lushan on April 20, 2013, five years after the Wenchuan Ms 8.0 earthquake, the seismogenic potential of southern Longmen Shan has been a considerable concern. Comparative studies of active faults and deep structures of the Lushan and Wenchuan earthquakes are important to evaluate Longmen Shan potential. Terrace measurements, geophysical surveys and borehole drilling reveal that late Quaternary fault activity in the southern segment of the Longmen Shan thrust belt is weaker than that along the central segment, Magnetotelluric data across the southern segment of the Longmen Shan thrust belt show that the central fault and the front-range fault are the electrical boundaries of the crust and that the Longmen Shan thrust belt is a high-resistivity body. The Lushan earthquake occurred at the boundary zone between the high and low-resistivity bodies, and the crustal structure of the southern Longmen Shan thrust belt matches the multiunit combination seismogenic model, indicating a potential large earthquake in Longmen Shan. Compared to conditions along the central segment, the low-resistivity layer of the upper and lower crust on the western side of the Songpan-Ganzi block develops along the Xianshuihe fault, which may reduce the strain accumulated from the Songpan-Ganzi block to the southern Longmen Shan thrust belt. This interpretation suggests that the main crustal shortening is accommodated by foreland thin fold structures, whereas the structural deformation accommodated by the thrust belt accounts for only a small proportion; thus, the seismogenic potential of southern Longmen Shan is weaker than that of the central segment.

AB A suite of bimodal volcanic rocks in the Kyrgyz North Tianshan belt is composed of totally similar to 100-m-thick basalt and basaltic andesite layers of the Karakastek Formation and totally similar to 700-m-thick rhyolite layers of the Kastek Formation, with minor amounts of interlayered felsic to intermediate tuff/ignimbrite. Zircon grains from a rhyolite sample have a weighted mean Pb-206/U-238 age of 416 +/- 8 Ma, which is considered to be the crystallization age of the rhyolite. The zircon grains have delta O-18 ranging from +6.5 to +7.3 parts per thousand. The calculated zircon saturation temperatures (T-Zr) range from 850 to 900 degrees C. Rhyolites have high total alkaline, Zr, Y and Nb contents and high Ga/Al similar to A(1)-type granitoids formed in an antra-plate setting. Mafic volcanic rocks have SiO2 ranging from 49.4 to 55.3 wt% and FeO2/MgO from 1.4 to 2.4, showing a tholeiitic trend. They have negative Nb and Ta anomalies on the primitive mantle-normalized trace element patterns and have epsilon(Nd)(t) of -1.5 to 0. There is a positive correlation between epsilon(Nd)(t) and Delta epsilon(Hf)(t) of the mafic volcanic rocks, indicative of crustal contamination. However, one least evolved basalt sample has Mg# of 57 with low Zr and Hf concentrations, indicating insignificant crustal contamination. Modeling results indicate that the mafic volcanic rocks may have been derived from a dry, garnet-bearing lherzolite mantle source. They have epsilon(Hf)(t) and epsilon(Nd)(t) varying along the "Island arc array", which is interpreted as the mantle source was metasomatized by slab-derived melts rather than fluids. In addition, the rhyolites have epsilon(Nd)(t) of -2.4 to -2.9, much lower than the mafic volcanic rocks, and were thus unlikely produced by the fractionation of basaltic magmas. The rhyolites show Nd-Hf isotope decoupling, which is interpreted as a result of the anataxis of Precambrian lower crust associated with the breakdown of garnet. Therefore, the early Devonian bimodal volcanic suite in the Kyrgyz North Tianshan belt was considered to have formed in an intra-plate setting.

AB The Proto-South China Sea (PSCS) represents the lithosphere that formerly occupied the region southeast of South China where the present-day South China Sea is located. The subduction and demise of the PSCS have attracted wide attention, whereas the pre-subduction history (particular the Mesozoic) of the region remains relatively neglected. In this paper, the radiolarian paleobiogeography of the region is analyzed to identify the paleobiogeographic affinity and paleo-connectivity of the PSCS with the Pacific and Tethys oceans during the Mesozoic. Then the continent-ocean configuration and tectonic evolution of the PSCS and adjacent areas are discussed through the integration of paleobiogeographical results and associated paleomagnetic, stratigraphic, and petrologic data. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) During the Triassic, the PSCS was situated in the transition zone between the Pacific and Tethys oceans, and its paleobiogeography was influenced by both oceans. The PSCS was characterized by complex tectonic overprinting by the Pacific and Tethyan tectonic regimes. (2) In the Early-Middle Jurassic, the PSCS was well connected to the Pacific Ocean but poorly connected to the Tethys Ocean, consistent with the paleobiogeography of the PSCS being mainly constrained by the Pacific Ocean. The PSCS was part of the Paleo-Pacific slab. (3) During the Late Jurassic-Cretaceous, the PSCS was in a semi-closed environment. The Late Jurassic-early Late Cretaceous PSCS was part of a west-facing Andean-type subduction zone, and the late Late Cretaceous PSCS was situated in an extensional tectonic setting.

AB The Longquan Shan fault zone (LQSF) locates in the Sichuan Basin of China, parallel to the well-known Longmen Shan fault zone. Different models for the LQSF indicate different understanding of the geological evolution of the Tibetan Plateau. In this paper, we provide evidences which demonstrate that the LQSF is a normal and deep buried fault zone. Firstly, we find distinct extensional strains around the LQSF based on Global Positioning System (GPS) observations. We also find that the downward GPS velocities across the LQSF decrease suddenly from 4 to 5 mm/yr at the west to roughly zero at the east. Secondly, we collate focal mechanism solutions to earthquakes of M >= 3.0 in the Sichuan Basin and find that 12 out of 21 earthquakes are normal earthquakes. The surrounding extensional strains and the high proportion of normal earthquakes indicate that the shallow part of the LQSF is normal at present. Thirdly, based on the migration section obtained from deep seismic reflection profiling, we outline the geometric structure of the LQSF. It is a deep-buried fault zone that reaches the Moho, with two branches at the top. Such a fault model corresponds with the realities of the low seismic activities around the Longquan Shan anticline, and the scattered earthquakes beneath the Chengdu plain. Finally, we propose a three-stage evolutional model about the Longquan Shan fault system, which includes the formation of anticline in Late Triassic, the uplift of the Mountain in Oligence, and the stage of normal characteristics of the fault zone from Late Miocene.

AB Extensive Mesoproterozoic magmatism occurred in the Karbi Hills Massif, NE India, providing a key to understanding the early geodynamic evolution of Karbi Craton during the Columbia (Nuna) supercontinent cycle. We present here LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb ages, Lu-Hf isotopic and geochemical data of Panbari-Geleki-Dallamara and Kuthori granitoids in the Kaziranga area in northern Karbi Craton. These granitoids occur as stock like bodies intruded into the Late Archean-Paleoproterozoic Basement Gneissic Complex, supracrustals and previously emplaced mafic magmatics. Due to subsequent tectono-thermal activities, the older magmato-sedimentary sequences suffered variable degrees of metamorphism and deformations. The U/Pb zircon geochronology indicates that these granitoids were emplaced over a span of about 94 m.y., subsequent to the emplacement of mafic dykes, sills and stocks in a post collision rift basin, now represented by the 'Shillong Basin'. The Karbi Hills granitoids are younger (1644 +/- 33-1550 +/- 25 Ma) than the Meghalaya felsic magmatics (1778 +/- 37-1620 +/- 9.2). Basin formation and sedimentation began in the Shillong Basin (Shillong Group) as early as 1900 Ma and continued till 1400 Ma, coinciding with the assembly and dismantling of Columbia supercontinent. Early Proterozoic psammopelitic sedimentation prior to and/or after the mafic-felsic intrusions is now represented by the 'Shillong Group'. The mafic magmatics occur in the craton, present a continental flood basalt character. The chemical makes up state that the granitoids bear mostly metaluminous but weakly per-aluminous, A-type, within plate characters. The granitoids are highly potassic and silica saturated (up to 74.3 wt % SiO2), REE deficient, K, Rb and Ba enriched but Nb, Ti and P depleted. The zircon epsilon(Hf(t)) for granitoids show a variation up to 7 eHf units (+1.5 to + 9.9), however, 13% grains possess negative epsilon Hf(t) values. This is particularly ascribed to minor mixing of magmas sourced from depleted mantle and metasomatised continental crust. There is, however, no record of any vestige of ophiolite preserved in the craton that would support an active subduction mechanism responsible for this part of early Mesoproterozoic magmatic episode.

AB The Karaburun Peninsula, which is considered to be a part of the Anatolide-Tauride Block, is situated between western Anatolia and the eastern part of the Aegean Sea, in a post-collisional extensional environment, and is located within the Izmir-Balikesir Transfer Zone. The Paleozoic - Mesozoic basement rocks of the peninsula are cut and covered by Miocene volcanic successions, comprising mostly andesitic lavas and volcanoclastic deposits that interfinger with detrital lacustrine deposits. A NW-SE elongated andesitic exogenous composite lava dome structure (major axis is 4 km and minor axis is 1 km) was identified and dated to be 16.39 +/- 0.34 Ma in age. It cuts and covers the Algal andesitic pyroclastic and epiclastic deposits of the Ildir peninsula. Internal structures and igneous fabrics indicate a composite exogenous lava dome structure with short distance lava flows over a flat floor of Algal ignimbrite. Emplacement of this Ildir composite lava dome was controlled by fissure-like volcanic activity along multiple fault lineaments as a result of extensional duplex negative palm-tree lineaments which are related to the Miocene NW-SE directed sinistral strike-slip transtensional fault zone of the Karaburun peninsula. Comparison of the andesitic Ildir lava dome to all volcanic rocks of the Karaburun peninsula implies that the parental (more mafic) magma which formed the lava dome was generated by partial melting of a highly contaminated mantle source which had been modified by subduction-derived fluid/melt components. The Ildir melts were subsequently differentiated by fractional crystallization and crustal assimilation processes in the crust.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) subsurface seismic data acquisition and modeling are rarely undertaken; consequently, the complex effects of oblique thrusting on the 3D morphology and kinematics of folds are still poorly understood. We use 3D seismic data to produce five 3D geometric models and compare our results with structural models of the Yanjinggou anticline in the Longmen Shan fold-and-thrust belt, to investigate the effects of oblique thrusting on 3D fold evolution. 3D geometric modeling results reveal that oblique thrusting may cause fold asymmetry, vertical axis rotation, and a curved fold axis. 3D seismic interpretations and structural modeling suggest that the Yanjinggou anticline developed as a trishear fault-propagation fold and experienced a maximum shortening amount of 1.2 +/- 0.1 km. The 3D structural and geometric models are consistent with paleomagnetic results, suggesting that the anticline was affected by oblique thrusting at an angle of 55 above a listric thrust fault with three fault ramps (19, 30, and 40), causing the fold to rotate and develop a curved morphology. The integrated method used in this study to investigate the effects of oblique thrusting on 3D fold morphology and kinematics can be applied to regional oblique thrusting in the Longmen Shan and other fold-and-thrust belts worldwide.

AB Alkaline and ultrapotassic volcanic rocks in the Afyon volcanic complex are regarded as the first products with asthenospheric signature after post-orogenic magmatism in western Turkey. The Yagcikoy volcanic complex (YVC), a key locality in the western off-axis of the Afyon volcanic complex, comprises three units consisting of domes, dykes, lava flows and associated volcaniclastic rocks intercalated with Middle Miocene fluvial/lacustrine deposits. Emplacement of the domes and dykes appears to have been controlled by NE-trending faults in a rift environment. The YVC is alkaline and shoshonitic in character, and all the volcanic units in the complex have similar geochemical patterns (enriched in LILE and LREE and depleted in Nb, Ta and Ti). The Sr-87/Sr-86 and Nd-143/Nd-144 ratios range from 0.704989 to 0.706662 and 0.512492 to 0.512595, respectively. The geochemical and isotopic data suggest that fractionation of parental basaltic trachyandesite magmas generated a magma chamber with chemically normal zonation. The geochemical data and modeling results suggest that the YVC originated from a spinel peridotite-bearing lithospheric mantle source that had been metasomatized by subduction components. The rifting environment that hosts the volcanic products is thought to have resulted from slab tear that caused the rise of fertile asthenospheric material to relatively shallow depths. The upwelling of hot asthenospheric melts through a tear subsequently melted the spinel peridotite-bearing lithospheric mantle source.

AB tTo reconstruct the chemical weathering history in Luzon, Philippines, since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), major and trace elements (Ti, Al, Fe, K, Ba, Rb, V, Sc, Cr, and Th) and grain size were determined for core MD06-3054 as well as the bulk and detrital fractions of three core-top samples from the western Philippine Sea (WPS). In combination with previously published Sr-Nd isotopes, our new results indicate that Ti-normalized elemental ratios in the study samples were not controlled by the quantity of biogenic, authigenic, or diagenetic materials, sediment provenance, or grain size. Instead, variations in Ti-normalized elemental ratios mainly reflect changes in chemical weathering intensity, with lower values representing stronger chemical weathering in Luzon. To assess long-term integrated chemical weathering patterns, we defined a stacked chemical weathering index (SCWI) based on all elemental ratios in the study core. Downcore SCWI records indicate that sediments deposited during the LGM underwent a degree of chemical weathering equal to that during the Holocene, and sediments deposited during the last deglaciation exhibit rapid changes in chemical weathering, with higher intensity during the Heinrich event 1 (H1) and Younger Dryas (YD), and lower intensity during the Bolling-Allerod (B/A) in the WPS. These observations are in excellent agreement with chemical weathering proxies, such as the K/Al ratios and chemical index of alteration when applied to the same core. We infer that persistent sea-level lowstand and induced reworking of poorly consolidated sediments on the eastern Luzon continental shelf during the LGM accounted for equal or slightly stronger chemical weathering for the LGM sediments relative to the Holocene sediments. Rainfall, rather than air temperature, in Luzon was responsible for the rapid changes in chemical weathering during the last deglaciation, with higher precipitation generating stronger chemical weathering during the H1 and YD than during the B/A. Our observations, combined with existing data, suggest that strong weathering of marine sediments during colder intervals of the middle late Quaternary is likely to be a general feature of the tropical West Pacific, although the mechanism that underlies this phenomenon remains controversial.

TI Evidence for three Cenozoic phases of upper crustal shortening of the

AB Cenozoic crustal shortening across the Longmen Shan (LMS) fold-and-thrust belt records the eastward growth of the Tibetan Plateau. Although the structural geometries of individual structures in the region have been studied, the kinematics and rates of deformation across these structures remain unclear. In this study, we construct a geological cross section to derive the subsurface structural architecture of the Xiongpo structure in the LMS piedmont using one seismic reflection profile, and data from two boreholes. The structure displays a superimposed deep fault-bend fold and shallow structural wedge with three splay thrust faults. Using two-dimensional kinematic models, based on fault-bend folding algorithm, we reconstruct three episodes of upper crustal shortening, with 7.0 +/- 0.3 km of total shortening. Combining with previously published low-temperature thermochronology data, we further estimate that the structure has experienced an average shortening rate of similar to 0.2 mm/yr since 40-25 Ma. We infer that the structure acted as the deformation front of the LMS fold-and-thrust belt between 40 and 25 Ma and 15-10 Ma driven by the eastward growth of the Tibetan Plateau. Finally, we review the shortening rates of other five structures within the LMS piedmont, and find that these six structures (including the Xiongpo structure) individually have undergone an average shortening rate < 0.5 mm/yr on each fault, suggesting that strain is partitioned along several structures within the LMS fold-and-thrust belt. We also show that the southern LMS piedmont has absorbed more upper crustal shortening than the central LMS, similar to 0.5-0.7 mm/yr, since similar to 2.6 Ma.

AB On 8th November 1997, the M-w 7.5 Manyi earthquake ruptured the left-lateral strike-slip Manyi fault in the central Tibetan Plateau. Despite its large magnitude, a comprehensive geological study on the co-seismic surface rupture has not yet been reported so far. Here we reported on our new results of the co-seismic surface ruptures and left-lateral offsets caused by the earthquake based on detailed interpretation of recently acquired high-resolution WorldView and SPOT-5 images. We recognized a primary similar to 185-km-long surface rupture that trends N80 degrees E, in consistence with previous results. Along the poorly developed segment at the eastern end of the Manyi fault, a new rupture is also identified, which trends N57 degrees E and extends similar to 17 km, The co-seismic surface rupture zone exhibits many distinct features such as stepovers, extensional cracks, ponds, restraining and releasing bends in relation to fault geometrical complexities. By visual analysis of the displaced geomorphic features using satellite imagery, we measured 198 co-seismic offsets along the similar to 200 km fault trace. The results show a similar to 3.7 m average offset and a maximum offset of up to similar to 7.5 m near the epicenter area. The newly found similar to 17-km-long rupture is interpreted to be linked to the main fault during the event. If the Manyi fault continues this northeastward propagation for additional 100 km, it will separate the BayanHar Block into two sub-blocks. Such a new hypothetical block model will influence assessment of seismic potential near the block boundaries and estimate of deformation of the BayanHar Block and the central Tibetan Plateau.

AB Homogenites are homogeneous and structureless, fine-grained rocks. They have been studied extensively in marine settings and are typically interpreted as being related to catastrophic events such as earthquakes. However, studies on lacustrine homogenite-like rocks are limited. New core data from the Shulu Sag in China reveal that thick massive calcilutites exist in the lower Shahejie 3 Formation, which formed during the middle Eocene rifting stage. Based on petrographic, geochemical, and mineralogical data, these massive calcilutites are interpreted as homogenites and grouped into two types. Type A homogenite is composed of intrabasinal materials characterized by high calcite, total organic carbon (TOC) content, and delta C-13 value. Type A homogenite has two facies successions, the first of which is characterized by homogeneous appearance capped by an erosional interface and the second is characterized by repeated massive-laminated calcilutite successions. Type B homogenite contains abundant allochthonous materials displaying relatively high dolomite content and low calcite, TOC, and delta C-13 content. Type B homogenite represents the topmost finer portion of a graded megabed which includes, from base to top, grain supported carbonate conglomerates, slumped deformed portions, and debrites. The whole unit can be considered as a megaturbidite. Earthquakes are the most reasonable triggers of homogenite formation in the Shulu Sag. Type A homogenites are thought to be derived by fluidification, resuspension, and decantation of lacustrine fines due to shock waves generated by an earthquake. Type B homogenites might be deposits of distal turbidity currents and turbid clouds transformed from other gravity flows. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the formation of homogenites caused by earthquakes in a confined lacustrine basin.

AB The Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis (EHS), as one of the most tectonically active regions on the Earth, is one of the best places to explore the relationship between tectonics and surface exhumation process. The uplift and exhumation history are often by one of two leading models: a stationary or localized "tectonic aneurysm" or a northeasterly "migrating crustal antiform". Previous researchers have placed great emphasis on the core zone of Namche Barwa antiform. However, the Dongjiu-Milin Fault Zone (DMFZ), which forms the northwestern boundary of the antiform and plays an important role for deformation process in the EHS, is still poorly understood. In this study, we focus on differential late-Cenozoic uplift across the DMFZ. We collected 10 bedrock samples in two vertical transects, one on the northwest side of the DMFZ on the Lhasa block and one on the southeast side on the Namche Barwa antiform, and conducted apatite fission track and zircon fission track analyses. Ten samples collected from the two vertical transects yield AFT ages between 3.2 million years ago (Ma) and 10.3 Ma and ZFT ages between 9.9 Ma and 12.9 Ma. A finite-element analysis reveals that the two sides of the DMFZ have undergone quite different uplift histories and processes in the late-Cenozoic: The Lhasa block is uniformly uplifted, while the Namche Barwa antiform is nonuniformly uplifted similar to a buckle fold. The phenomenon revealed in this study is best explained by a mechanism whereby the EHS is characterized by the northeasterly migration of an antiform.

AB The effects of supercritical CO2 (ScCO2) on reservoir property changes of the Chang 7 Member tight sandstones of the Yanchang Formation, Ordos Basin, China, were investigated using CO2-brine flow-through experiments, in conjunction with detailed rock and fluid characterization (pre- and post-experiment) using X-ray diffraction mineral analysis, 3D computed tomography scanning, high-resolution scanning electron microscopy, and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrophotometry. An in situ 3D model was developed to define porosity-mineral evolution. Experiments on three contrasting samples show that minerals such as potassium (K) feldspar, albite, and calcite are variably dissolved during CO2-brine-mineral interactions. The dissolution, migration, and re-precipitation of clay minerals are common and are characterized by the dissolution of chlorite and the re-precipitation of kaolinite, calcium montmorillonite, and sodium montmorillonite. The original chlorite-kaolinite framework of the host rocks was destroyed. Precipitated and re-migrated clay particles (e.g., kaolinites and smectites) that were released by the dissolution accumulated in pore throats, resulting in changes to the pore system and in the physical properties of the host rocks. Physical property change pathways vary among the studied samples, with porosity being reduced by 4.5% and 12.8% or increased by 13.7% by the end of the experiments. Permeability reduction was 33.3%-81.2% and is positively correlated to host rock clay mineral content. The influence of the type and content of clay minerals on porosity requires further evaluation. The findings of the study have implications for the large-scale injection of CO2 into reservoirs during enhanced oil recovery programs and for carbon capture, utilization, and storage programs.

AB The last interglacial contains information about how climate behaves during a warm period comparable to the current interval. However, there is no consensus on the key signatures and force of the last interglacial climate changes at present. Here we present a high-resolution stalagmite oxygen isotope record from central China, which spans from 123.3 to 116.8 ka. The stalagmite delta O-18 time-series bears a resemblance to changes in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation before the demise of the last interglacial, like the condition during the Holocene. Superimposed on the long-term delta O-18 record is a pronounced shift to more positive values at around 121.6 ka, indicating a switch of the Asian monsoon mean state into a weaker condition. This monsoon shift correlates with a decrease in the mean state of the South American Summer Monsoon, and a well-known abrupt mid-Eemian cooling event at high latitudes. These correlations indicate broad-scale features of the climate shift over the warm last interglacial. Another positive delta O-18 shift of up to 3.5 parts per thousand occurred at around 120 ka, representing the demise of the last interglacial Asian monsoon. By comparing the stalagmite delta O-18 records against changes in ice volume and summer insolation during the last interglacial and recent Holocene, respectively, we conclude that the decreasing Northern Hemisphere summer insolation dominated the rapid demise of the last interglacial in the Asian monsoon region.

AB Different tectonic episodes from Late Triassic to recent times in the eastern Binalud Mountains have resulted from convergence and transpression between the Turan and Central Iran plates. Heterogeneous deformation and variable portions of pure and simple shear, demonstrated by finite strain and vorticity analysis in the Mashhad metamorphic rocks, indicate strain partitioning during the first tectonic episode. Modern strain partitioning is characterized by reverse and strike-slip faulting along the Neyshabur fault system and Shandiz fault zone in the southern and northern flanks of the eastern Binalud, respectively. Time-transgressive regional deformation migrated from the hinterland of the belt into the foreland basin, from northeast to the southwest of the mountains. Different generations of deformation resulted in obliteration of the subduction-related accretionary wedge, and growth of an orogenic wedge resulted from collision between the Central Iran and Turan plates.

TI The Tamrau Block of NW New Guinea records late Miocene-Pliocene

AB The Tamrau Block is a geological terrane located in the Bird's Head Peninsula of NW New Guinea. Relatively little is known about this terrane and how it relates to other parts of western New Guinea. The geological history and provenance of this terrane is difficult to resolve because it is found at the boundary between the Australian, Philippine Sea, Caroline, and Pacific plates. This segment of the plate boundary records episodes of deformation, magmatism, and exhumation associated with the interaction of these three tectonic plates. For instance, the southern edge of the Tamrau Block is bounded by a major strike-slip fault zone (the Sorong Fault Zone), previous studies imply that the terrane may have been translated some distance along this fault zone during the Cenozoic. We seek to understand the geological history and provenance of the Tamrau Block. To do this, we report new field observations made during a three-month field campaign in a poorly exposed region, together with new petrographic and geochronology data. U-Pb detrital zircon age spectra were obtained from five sedimentary and metamorphic sequences and the results were combined with existing biostratigraphic age data to reassess the stratigraphy and tectonic history of the region. The oldest rocks in the Tamrau Block (the Tamrau Formation) represent Jurassic-Cretaceous passive margin sediments. These were deformed and metamorphosed in at least three distinct events - the first phase of which involved amphibolite fades conditions (and produced the first reported instance of metamorphic kyanite from the Bird's Head), possibly in the Oligo-Miocene. These Jurassic-Cretaceous rocks are unconformably overlain by the Ajai Limestone. Both units are cross-cut and overlain by intrusives and eruptives of the middle Miocene Moon Volcanics. The heat associated with these intrusives baked the Tamrau Formation and the overlying Ajai Limestone, resulting in andalusite growth in the Tamrau Formation and hornfelsing of the limestones. Deposition of the overlying Koor Formation occurred from the middle-late Miocene, and was partially contemporaneous with volcanism. An episode of crustal shortening occurred after the deposition of the Koor Formation with the development of asymmetric folds and steeply-inclined reverse faults. This is marked by a late Miocene-Pliocene break in deposition between the Koor Formation and undeformed Opmorai Formation (similar to 10.5-4.5 Ma) and records the collision of part of an oceanic island arc (Tosem Block) to the Tamrau Block, an event also recognised in other parts of New Guinea. A comparison of the U-Pb detrital zircon age spectra from sedimentary rocks within the Tamrau Block and those reported in other studies indicate that there is no relationship between the rocks of the Tamrau and Kemum blocks (which are in faulted contact). Instead, the U-Pb detrital age data share similarities with rocks from the Lengguru Fold and Thrust Belt and Weyland Overthrust in the south-east. We therefore propose that the Tamrau Block was transported westwards similar to 300 km to its current position along the Sorong Fault Zone after the late Miocene-Pliocene collision between the Tosem Block and the northern margin of the Australian Plate.

AB The Yanxi and Duiershi formations of the Middle-Upper Ordovician in South China are composed of black, grayish black, and dark gray thin-bedded cherts and siliceous slates, rich in carbonaceous materials and pyrite. Horizontal beddings are developed. The strata contain randomly distributed fossils. Radiolarians are discovered in the Loudi, Yongzhou, Hengyang, Ji'an and Ganzhou sections. The Radiolaria from two sections are identified as Protoentactinia sp. Abundances of radiolarian in the central area of Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces are higher than in the southern area. The strata become thickened while the amounts of siliceous materials are decreased and argillaceous contents are increased from northwest to southwest for the Yanxi and Duiershi formations. The lithology gradually changes from carbonate rocks in the north to elastic rocks in the south. delta Si-30 values of chert and siliceous slate range from -0.6 to 1.18 with AL(2)O(3)/(Al2O3 + Fe2O3), MnO/TiO2, LaN/CeN, Ce/Ce*, and (La/Yb)(N) ratios of 0.65-0.97, 0.01-0.16, 0.99-1.27, 0.85-1.10, and 0.91-1.66, respectively. The SiO2 and TiO2 average contents are 89.08% and 0.27%. The SiO2 contents decrease while the TiO2 increase from northwest to southeast. They have similar the REE concentration with no obvious Eu anomalies. The Yanxi and Duiershi formations were deposited predominately in a bathyal environment on the continental slope-basin and the seawater was stagnant. In the Middle-early Late Ordovician, the Nanhua basin occupied a rather large area and sedimentary rocks in the region around Hengyang-Jian were deposited in the basin center with terrigenous source derived from the southeast.

AB In this study, we employed cosmogenic nuclide Be-10 analysis to determine the formation ages of the Yellow River terraces in the Mijia Shan and the Laolongwan Basin at the northeastern periphery of the Tibetan Plateau. The aim of this study is to determine local fluvial incision rates and the effect from tectonic activities. The two sets of terraces were surveyed in field and dated by cosmogenic Be-10 exposure dating method. The results show that the best-fitting terrace ages in the Mijia Shan are respective 68.0(-9.4)(+11.2)V ka for T11 and 174.7(-38.4)(+52) ka for T14. In addition, in the Laolongwan basin, sample S3 constrains an age of 123.9 +/- 2.7 ka and S2 yields an age of 45.0 +/- 1.8 ka. Combining the strath heights of the sampled terraces, the fluvial incision rates were determined. The results showed that the fluvial incision rate of the Yellow River is similar to 1.94 mm/a in the Mijia Shan over the last 175 ka, while a much lower incision rate of similar to 0.73 mm/a is yielded in the Laolongwan Basin since the last similar to 120 ka. The incision rate in the Mijia Shan is almost twice more than that in the Laolongwan Basin. Considering the same climatic condition in both the Mijia Shan and the Laolongwan Basin, the difference between the two incision rates (similar to 1.21 mm/a) might be due to local tectonic deformation which is derived from the Haiyuan active strike-slip fault. Consequently, our results showed that the Haiyuan fault plays an important role in accelerating the incision rate in the Mijia Shan. Hence, it is suggested that the role of the main geological structures across the main river should also be considered when studying the evolution of terraces of big rivers.

AB Giant vein-type bitumen deposits in the Wuerhe region within the northwestern Junggar Basin of NW China are representative examples of similar bitumen deposits that are found in a number of other locations in both China and elsewhere. These deposits can provide information on regional tectonics as well as insights into hydrocarbon and bitumen exploration, but the origin of the deposits remains unclear. This study focuses on determining the origin of the Wuerhe bitumen deposit using field, petrological, and geochemical data. Results show that the bitumen veins are generally hosted by shallow high-angle fault systems located within the nose of the Wuerhe fault-fold. The bitumen is of low maturity and has an organic origin, having formed by secondary alteration (most likely biodegradation) of crude oil sourced from the lower Permian Fengcheng Formation (P(1)f). The bitumen contains high concentrations of beta-carotane and gammacerane, low concentrations of Ts and diasteranes, and comprises (in ascending order of concentration) C-20-C-21-C-23 tricyclic terpanes and C-27-C-28-C-29 regular steranes. The bitumen was most likely formed during the Early Cretaceous under the control of faults. A fault-controlled model is presented for hydrocarbon migration and accumulation and the subsequent formation of this bitumen within the northwestern Junggar Basin. This model suggests that future hydrocarbon exploration should focus on the cores of fault-fold noses and areas of minor-fold nose near deep-seated fault zones, especially where these areas correspond to potential moderate- to shallow-depth Jurassic-Cretaceous reservoirs. The new model should be able to guide exploration in other basins with similar tectonic settings of this study, i.e., superimposed thrusting, compression, and transtension.

AB We studied the low- and high-frequency source processes of the 2017 Jiuzhaigou earthquake, and focused on when and where the high-frequency (2.0-10.0 Hz) seismic energy was radiated in relation to the low-frequency (0.02-0.5 Hz) seismic energy. The low-frequency source processes were jointly inverted using teleseismic P and SH broadband waves combined with near-field strong motion data. A three-dimensional model considering real topography was used to compute the near-field Green's function. The high-frequency wave radiation was in versed using the envelope of acceleration seismograms of near-field records and the empirical Green's function by the differential evolution algorithm. The results showed the 2017 Jiuzhaigou earthquake was a typical strike-slip earthquake with a seismic moment of about 6.9 x 10(18) N m and maximum slip of about 1.5 m. During the 2 s following the initial rupture, the earthquake radiated large high-frequency waves but small low-frequency waves. Then, the rupture broke the high stress drop area in the up-dip direction of the hypocenter, generating an obvious asperity located just above the hypocenter. About 60% of the seismic moment of the earthquake was released during about 2-6 s after initiation of the rupture. The high-frequency radiation areas were mostly located on the lower periphery of the asperity, in accordance with the complementary relationship between the distribution of high-frequency waves and zones of large slip, which might be attributable to both the initiation of the rupture and the breaking of the high stress drop area. Parts of the high-frequency radiation areas overlapped the lower part of the asperity, where the high-frequency radiation occurred about 2 s earlier than the low-frequency radiation. The stress drop of the 2017 Jiuzhaigou earthquake was considerably lower than average for global intraplate earthquakes, but similar to that of the 2013 Lushan earthquake.

AB Linking volcanic and plutonic systems and examining them, together is critical to evaluate magma chamber processes and mantle-crust, interactions in lithospheric scale. Solarya Volcano-plutonic complex, (SVPC) is one of the major volcano-plutonic complexes located in NW, Turkey and it is remarkable for its coeval and cogenetic plutonic, hypabyssal and volcanic rocks. Solarya pluton (22 Ma) is an epizonal, pluton which consists of three main rock groups; K-feldspar, megacrystalline granodiorite, microgranodiorite and haplogranite. Plutonic rocks pass into hypabyssal association, represented by, granodiorite/quartz-diorite porphyry sheet intrusive rocks which were, injected into the ring and radial faults concurrently with the, emplacement of the pluton. Hypabyssal and volcanic rocks cut one another, and fragments of hypabyssal rocks are found in volcanic rocks. Volcanic, association, is formed from trachyandesite, andesite and dacite lavas, with associated pyroclastic rocks. New Ar-40/Ar-39 radiometric ages of, volcanic and hypabyssal associations display that, they have Ar-40/Ar-38, biotite ages changing from 23.1 +/- 0.2 to 21.0 +/- 0.2 indicating that they, are coeval with Solarya Plutonic Association. Petrographical features of, SVPC display disequilibrium textures such as oscillatory zoning, sieve, and honeycomb textures in plagioclase, reverse mantled biotite and, hornblende crystals as indicatives of open system magma chamber processes, (mixing/mingling and/or AFC). Plutonic, hypabyssal and volcanic, associations of SVPC show similar major-trace and Sr-Nd-Pb-O isotopic, compositions indicating a common magma source and similar magma chamber, processes. They are medium to high-K talc-alkaline rocks and display, enrichment in LILE and depletion in Nb, Ta, P and Ti. The geochemical and, isotopic characteristics of SVPC are considered to reflect an enriched, mantle (EMII) or sub-continental lithospheric mantle source. Bulk mixing, model between epsilon Nd and Sr-87/Sr-86 isotopic data suggests that, the crustal, contribution to the enriched mantle source is about 25-45%. Evaluation of all these data suggests that, Solarya Volcano-plutonic, Complex with early Miocene age was developed under syn-convergent, extensional regime concurrent with the exhumation of other major volcanoplutonic, and core complexes (eg. Kozak, Menderes, Kazdag, Cataldag) in NW, Anatolia.

AB We investigate significant earthquake sequences in the observation period between 2000 and 2018 along the Tuz Golu Fault Zone in Central Anatolia. These sequences include a series of strong events with moment magnitudes (M-w) > 5.0, e.g. 30 July 2005 Bala-Ankara M-w 5.2, 20 December 2007 Bala-Ankara M-w 5J and 26 December 2007 M-w 5.6 Afar-Ankara earthquakes. The mainshocks are shallow focus strike-slip events with minor normal component at depths of 12-15 km. Focal depths of aftershocks range from 2 to 30 km. The focal mechanisms of the aftershocks are mainly normal faulting with variable strike-slip components. The geometry of focal mechanisms reveals a normal faulting regime with E-W and also NE-SW trending directions of T-axis in the entire activated region. A stress tensor inversion of focal mechanism data is performed to acquire a more accurate picture of the Tuz Gou Fault Zone stress field. The stress tensor inversion results display a predominant normal stress regime with a NNE SSW oriented maximum horizontal compressive stress (S-H). According to high-resolution hypocenter relocations of the Tuz Golu Fault Zone seismic sequences, eight clusters are revealed. The aftershock activities in the observation period between 5 March 2000 and 2 June 2018 extend from NW to SE direction. Seismic cross-sections show that a complex pattern of the hypocenter distribution with the activation of Tuz Gold Fault Zone segments. The western clusters are associated with a fault plane trending mainly N-S and dipping towards almost vertical, while the eastern clusters are related to a fault plane trending NW and dipping towards SE direction. The best constrained focal depths are mainly confined in the crust (depth < 30 km) and range from 2 to 30 km. In this study, we compare the results of an analysis of b-values from seismicity and stress tensors of focal mechanism solutions to understand their coupling in terms of faulting and earthquake hazard implications. In particular, this comparison allows to investigate the spatiotemporal correlation between b-values and stress distributions and it is therefore able to locate fault segments that have a high potential of generating large earthquakes. According to recent seismicity, b-values range from 0.5 to 1.5 along the Tuz Golu Fault Zone in Central Anatolia. The maximum horizontal compressive stress (S-H) indicates N-S and NE-SW directions while the minimum horizontal compressive stress (Sh) displays E-W. These results represent that low stress variances are correlated with high b-values. Low b-values are predominant in areas with high stress rates, consistent with a high heterogeneity of focal mechanisms.

AB This study investigated the evolution of the middle reach of the Yellow River by examining the latest Cenozoic (similar to 5.0-0.15 Ma) sedimentary history of the Weihe and Sanmenxia basins in the Weihe region of North China. Although the development of the two basins and the evolution of the Yellow River have long been related to the rapid uplift of the Tibetan Plateau, the relationship between the landform evolution and regional tectonics is still poorly understood. Here, we report the results of a detailed study on sedimentation and provenance of the two basins and their spatial and temporal relationships to regional fault development. The results show that the two basins were possibly originally isolated from each other, between similar to 5 Ma and similar to 2.8-2.6 Ma, but later connected by the Yellow River at similar to 2.8-2.6 Ma. This process is recorded in the coarsening-upward sequence of the Weihe Basin strata and the coeval fining-upward succession of the Sanmenxia Basin strata. At similar to 1.0 Ma, the Sanmenxia Basin strata developed a coarsening-upward trend, which we interpret as an indication of the formation of the Yellow River in the region. In addition, changes in the drainage system at similar to 2.8-2.6 Ma and at similar to 1.0 Ma have been recorded as dramatic provenance changes in the sediments of the Sanmenxia Basin.

AB We present here new mineral chemistry and major trace element and Sr-Nd-Pb-O isotope data as well as detailed field and petrographic studies of the Topuk Pluton (TP; ca. 48 Ma) and its hypabyssal counterparts. We aim to constrain the granitic magma genesis and emplacement and magmatic processes within the framework of post-collisional evolution of NW Anatolia. The TP is a shallow level intrusion (1.5-2.1 kbar, 680-760 degrees C, and 4.5-6.3 km depth) which is characterized by a dominant granodiorite composition and presents holocrystalline porphyritic texture. The pluton includes mafic microgranular enclaves (MMEs) of diorite/quartz diorite composition. During its emplacement, the pluton developed radial and ring fractures around itself, and aplite, porphyry dykes, and stocks were emplaced coeval with the pluton along these ring and radial fractures. The TP shows metaluminous and calc-alkaline I-type characteristics. Normal-mid ocean ridge basalt-normalized trace element patterns show that the samples are enriched in large-ion lithophile elements and light rare earth elements but depleted in Nb, Ti, and Ta elements. Granodiorite, MMEs, and hypabyssal rocks present similar initial Sr-87/Sr-86 and Nd-143/Nd-144 isotopic values, which lie in the ranges 0.705860-0.706247 and 0.512455-0.512584, respectively. The (206)pb/(204)pb, (207)pb/(204)pb, (208)pb/Pb-206, and Pb-207/(20)6Pb ratios are 18.831-19.046, 15.673-15.748, 2.0621-2.0725, and 0.82816-0.83321 values, respectively, while the delta O-18 isotope values range from 9.6 to 10.7.
   These similar Sr-Nd-Pb-O isotopic features of MMEs and host granodiorites indicate a common igneous precursor as the magma source. We infer that the magma-forming TP originated from enriched mantle type II (EMIT) with contribution from the lower crust. The results of numerical modelling indicate that this lower crustal input ranges from 5 to 20%. The Eocene melt generation was most probably caused by the upwelling asthenosphere due to the break-off of Neo-Tethys slab in NW Anatolia.

AB The Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) is one of the largest and long-lived accretionary collages worldwide, and provides an ideal opportunity to address the fundamental geological processes and continental growth of accretionary orogens. However, the tectonic history of the CAOB is still controversial, Previous studies mainly focused on the process and model of accretion and subduction, but did not pay much attention to oceanic intraplate volcanoes. In this paper, we provide an overview of the salient features of twelve OIB-hosting accretionary complexes with ages from Late Neoproterozoic to Early Carboniferous in western the CAOB, and distinguish rock association of typical seamounts from accretionary complexes and shear zones, including pillow basalt, volcanic breccia, limestone, olistostromes and terrestrial elastic rocks. Combined with unique structural features of seamount, the stratigraphic framework of seamount was preliminarily reconstructed in Paleo-Asian Ocean, but the distribution and scale of seamounts is still not clear. Geoehemically, volcanic rocks from sea-mounts are mainly alkaline basalts with litte tholeiitic basalts. The alkaline basalts are characterized by LREE enrichment and HREE depletion, and no obvious Nb, Ta and Ti negative anomalies, suggesting typical OIB affinity. The Nd, Sr and Pb isotopic features indicate that magma sources have enriched components and show fluid metasomatism. In short, this is consistent with geochemical features of Louisville, Ontong Java and Hawaiian seamounts which are related to mantle plumes, but do not contain high-Mg picrite and komatitic basalt. Based on our observations, and in combination with previous work, we present an innovative model in which the CAOB was involved multiple intra-oceanic arc with seamounts subduction and accretion, which is similar to the present-day Pacific and can better explain the tectonic evolution of the CAOB. However, further studies are needed to document the distribution, scale and mantle dynamics of seamounts in the CAOB.

AB The relatively low Mesoproterozoic oxygen concentrations in atmospheric and marine environments remained controversial because the marine chemical evolution has not been sufficiently researched. To provide a better understanding of the secular redox conditions of shallow-water sedimentary environments and to perform global isotopic comparisons, we present new data of rare earth elements and yttrium (REE + Y), redox-sensitive elements (RSEs), and carbonate carbon-oxygen isotopes from Mesoproterozoic marine succession in the Shennongjia Group of the Yangtze Shennongjia area. Seawater-like REE + Y distribution patterns with significantly negative Ce anomalies, which had previously been screened to avoid detrital effects in the leached carbonates, illustrate the oxidation of shallow seawaters during the deposition of this group. Although the Ce/Ce* and (Pr/Yb)(SN) values remain relatively low in carbonate samples throughout the Mesoproterozoic, these values are higher than those of the modern oxygenated ocean, indicating less intense oxygenation. This conclusion is supported by the high enrichment factors of the RSEs in screened samples resulting from a considerable marine reservoir for dissolved RSEs in a constantly oxidized environment. Under these circumstances, the delta C-13(carb) chemostratigraphy is moderately varied, with values near +3.5 parts per thousand and lower than +5 parts per thousand, and more dynamic variability is observed over time, which is related to progressively smaller marine dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) reservoirs. In addition, the significant negative excursion of delta C-13(carb) near to or less than 0 parts per thousand in this lower subgroup is globally matched in different blocks and may correspond to the oxidation of isotopically light organic matter in oceans. A worldwide comparison indicates that the delta C-13(carb) chemostratigraphies combined with limited geochronological data may constrain this extended negative excursion to ca. 1.3-1.2 Ga and the Shennongjia Group to ca. 1.3-1.1 Ga.

As the Mesoproterozoic Xiong'er Group in the southern NCC is regarded as the oldest volcanic-sedimentary succession after the final amalgamation of the NCC, we reviewed the sedimentary environments and provenances of Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic sedimentary sequences above the strata in order to understand tectono-sedimentary evolution of the southern NCC during this period. The early Mesoproterozoic sedimentary rocks were deposited in alluvial-fan to fluvial and (fan-) delta-coastal environments suggesting an initial stage of basin development. Fine-grained clastic sedimentary rocks interlayered with carbonate deposition formed on the southern NCC later, and implied a broad subsidence before ca. 1611 Ma. After that, depositional breaks caused by regional tectonic uplifts led to different sedimentary sequences and lateral migration of the depocenter from the north to the south (to the current co-ordinates). The unconformably overlying sedimentary rocks in the north of the southern NCC were deposited in restricted marine basins during late Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic as a whole. However, the enlargement of shallow-marine shelf led to the thick accumulation of carbonates in the southernmost NCC characterized by a deepening-upward trend from the late Mesoproterozoic sequence. The Neoproterozoic sedimentary sequence is typified by sharp increasing terrigenous supplies and frequent changes in environment, and could be deposited in a tectonically active basin in consideration of its close association with volcanism. Detrital zircon grains from the oldest clastic sequence (i.e., the Bingmagou Formation) overlying the Xiong'er volcanic-sedimentary rocks and from the earliest Paleozoic sedimentary rocks (i.e., the Xinji Formation) are used to track changes of provenances. Detrital zircon grains from the Bingmagou Formation display two dominant age peaks at ca. 1850 and 2500 Ma and three secondary peaks at ca. 2100, 2350 and 2700 Ma. In contrast, detrital zircon grains from the Xinji Formation have three major age peaks at ca. 1850, 2200 and 2500 Ma and three subordinate populations of 950, 1100 and 1450 Ma. In combination with the uplifts during the Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic, Neoproterozoic magmatism, and a large amount of detrital zircon derived from Rodinia-related orogenesis in the southern NCC, it is very likely that the major changes of basin configuration could be related to significant tectonic readjustment along with the evolution of the Rodinia Supercontinent.

AB In this study, we present a new crustal thickness model of mainland China created from the inversion of EIGEN-6C4 global gravity model. We took advantage of a high-resolution gravimetric data and the regularized inversion, based on the Gauss-Newton formulation of Bott's equation to resolve the Moho topography. The inversion process uses tesseroids to account for the earth curvature. Moho depth modeling for such a massive landmass cannot ignore the earth's curvature. The Bouguer effect, terrain effect, and gravity effect due to sediments were also corrected and calculated in a spherical approximation. The resulting crustal thickness model was validated with 2992 seismological data points and compared with continental-scale crustal thickness models for mainland China. The final crustal thickness model shows a minimum value of similar to 26 km in Eastern China to a thick crust of over 75 km under the Tibetan Plateau. Nevertheless, the results also show a considerable difference in unconstrained areas of the Tibetan plateau with a crustal thickness of similar to 20 km and similar to 6 km in sedimentary areas. The tectonic terranes show similar depth estimates for all the continental scale models of mainland China, but the lateral variation differs considerably. The results also expose two East-West fold belt trends on the Tibetan Plateau, a 44 km thick crust between Western and Eastern China, and a 37 km NNE trend line, which separates the stable eastern cratonic blocks from the thinned crustal blocks. Overall, our high-resolution model yields an improved representation of crustal features over previously gravity crustal thickness models of mainland China.

AB Temperature increase caused by thermal discharge from power plants promotes phytoplankton growth and frequent bloom in eutrophic subtropical waters, particularly in cold seasons. Suspension filter-feeding bivalves show size-selective grazing on phytoplankton. Thus, we hypothesized that algal bloom under thermal stimulation could be controlled and that phytoplankton community was structured by oyster farming. Here, ten cruises were conducted in two oyster farms (OFs) and control areas (CAS) adjacent to the Ninghai Power Plant in the upper section of Xiangshan Bay during 2009-2015. We found that thermal discharge induced severe winter algal blooms, Phytoplankton abundance and chlorophyll a (chla) were significantly lower (46.3% and 28.3%, respectively) in OF than in CA, indicating a high filtration efficiency by oysters and the associated biofouling assemblages. In addition, oyster farming significantly increased species richness (by 26.3%), Shannon-Wiener diversity (by 38.3%), and Pielou's evenness indices (by 28.8%) and reduced suspended solids (by 12.2%), total organic carbon (by 18.4%), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (by 1.5%), and phosphorus (by 3.7%). Furthermore, oyster farming considerably reduced (increased) micro-chla contribution (pheophytin/chla) by 34.8% (71.1%), suggesting a strong size-selective grazing on phytoplankton. Analysis of similarity revealed a significant difference in phytoplankton community composition between OF and CA. However, after the removal of culture rafts, all the abundance, chla, species diversity, dominant species, size structure, and community composition of phytoplankton showed no significant difference. Our study demonstrated that oyster farming effectively alleviated eutrophication and algal bloom and enhanced phytoplankton diversity, which provides guidance for aquaculture and ecological restoration in subtropical coastal eutrophic waters.

AB Heterogeneous photochemical reactions associated with natural iron (hydr)oxides and oxalic acid have attracted a great deal of scientific attention in the application of organic pollutants degradation. However, the reaction mechanism is still unclear due to the complicated iron cycles and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In this study, the in situ attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was implemented to investigate the adsorption process and photochemical behavior of oxalic acid on the surface of ferrihydrite. A comprehensive reaction mechanism from the perspective of charge transfer process, including homogeneous-heterogeneous iron cycling and ROS generation, was illustrated in detail. We found that oxalic acid was first adsorbed on the surface of ferrihydrite with a mononuclear bidentate binding geometry. Interestingly, this mononuclear bidentate complex on the surface of ferrihydrite was stable under visible light irradiation. Subsequently, the whole complex departed from ferrihydrite surface through non-reduction dissolution with the form of Fe(C2O4)(+). In the solution, the Fe(C2O4)(+) complexes would quickly convert to Fe(C2O4)(2)(-) complexes. Under visible light irradiation, the electrons generated from the photolysis of Fe(C2O4)(2)(-) complex reacted with O-2 to form O-2(center dot-)/center dot OOH. Meanwhile, Fe(III) was reduced to Fe(II). Finally, the produced O-2(center dot-)/center dot OOH could react with Fe(II) through a one-step way to generate center dot OH, which possessed higher center dot OH formation efficiency than that through the two-step way of H2O2 as the intermediates. This study helps us with understanding of in-situ photochemical reaction mechanism of ferrihydrite-oxalic acid system, and also provides guidance to effectively utilize widespread iron (hydr)oxides and organic acids in natural environment to develop engineered systems for water treatment.

AB Sub-visible particles, an often-overlooked fine particle (0.45-10 mu m) with a size between sludge solids and soluble microbial products (SMP), have recently been identified as a critical foulant in anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBRs), and our recent new insights into the size-fractionation and composition of sub-visible particles in AnMBRs have enabled fouling to be understood in more depth. Here, we investigated the microbial diversity of the sub-visible particles in three size fractions (i.e., 5-10, 1-5, and 0.45-1 mu m) from bulk and cake solutions in a lab-scale AnMBR, and their fouling potential was further explored based on their filtration behavior and biofilm formation. Results show that with decreasing particle size, a significant shift in microbial communities was observed for the sub-visible particles in both bulk and cake solutions; (a) with notable decreases in filamentous microbes in the order SJA-15, GCA004, and Anaerolineales of phylum Chioroflexi, and, (b) with substantial increases in sulfate-reducing bacteria (i.e., the family Syntrophobacteraceae, genus DCE29 of family Thermodesulfovibrionaceae, Desulfovibrio, and Geobacter). More importantly, the filamentous microbes associated with micro-particles (5 -10 mu m) led to higher cake fouling resistances while free living cells in the form of colloidal particles (0.45-1 Am) induced severer pore blocking. Moreover, the micro-particles had an enhanced capacity to favor biofilm formation (00595 = 1.0-2.5, categorized as highly positive), thus potentially aggravating biofouling. This work advances our knowledge on the effect of particle size on communities and underlying fouling behavior of microbes associated with fine particles in AnMBRs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nitrilotris-methylenephosphonic acid (NTMP) has been widely used as an antiscalant in reverse osmosis (RO) desalination and other industrial processes to inhibit scaling from calcium and other hardness ions. Removal of NTMP from RO concentrate can induce the precipitation of oversaturated scale-forming substances, enable additional water recovery from RO concentrate, and reduce the risk of eutrophication after brine disposal. This study investigated the kinetics and mechanisms of oxidative degradation of NTMP by UV photolysis of persulfate at 254 nm. Results showed that NTMP was effectively degraded by persulfate photolysis and the reaction followed pseudo first-order kinetics. The degradation of NTMP was favorable at circumneutral pHs but significantly inhibited in highly alkaline conditions (e.g., pH of 11.5), mainly due to the reduced concentration of SO4 center dot-. Using a competition reaction kinetics approach, the second -order rate constants of NTMP with SO4 center dot- and HO center dot were determined to be (2.9 +/- 0.6) x 10(7) M-1 s(-1) and (1.1 +/- 0.1) x 10(8) M-1 s(-1), respectively. SO4 center dot- had a predominant contribution to NTMP degradation (62%-95%), because the steady-state concentration of SO4 center dot- was 11-54 times higher than that of HO center dot at pHs between 4 and 11.5. NTMP degradation rate increased with an increase in persulfate dosage and a decrease in NTMP concentration. In the real RO concentrate, NTMP degradation rate was impacted by the presence of chloride and bicarbonate. The degradation of NTMP started with the cleavage of C-N bonds, and then generated intermediates including iminodi(methylene)phosphonate, hydroxymethylphosphonic acid and aminotris(methylenephosphonic acid), which were eventually mineralized into ammonia, phosphate and carbon dioxide. This study demonstrated that UV/persulfate is a promising technology to remove phosphonate antiscalants from RO concentrate. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although landfill is suspected to be releasing microplastics to the environment, there is few empirical researches carried out. To clarify suspicions of landfills as potential sources of microplastics, twelve leachate samples from four active and two closed municipal solid waste landfills were investigated. Microplastics were found in all the landfill leachate samples. In total, seventeen different types of plastics were identified in the leachate samples with calculated concentration ranging from 0.42 to 24.58 items/L. Polyethylene and polypropylene were the predominant polymer types. 99.36% microplastics were derived from the fragmentation of plastic waste buried in landfills. The size of 77.48% microplastics was between 100 and 1000 mu m. The study shows that the generation, accumulation and release of micro plastic in landfills is a long-term process. The results of our study provide preliminary evidence and validate that landfill isn't the final sink of plastics, but a potential source of microplastics. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Hydroxyl radical and non-hydroxyl radical pathways for trichloroethylene

AB Catalyzed H2O2 propagations (CHP) is characterized by the most robust reactivity of any of the in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) technologies because it generates the strong oxidant hydroxyl radical along with nucleophiles + reductants, such as superoxide radical. The most common groundwater contaminants, trichioroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE), were used as model contaminants in evaluating the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) dosage on contaminant destruction kinetics. Both TCE and PCE degradation rates increased with H2O2 dosages up to 0.1 M, and then decreased with higher H2O2 dosages. Parallel reactions conducted with the addition of the hydroxyl radical scavenger 2-propanol and the hydroxyl radical -specific probe nitrobenzene confirmed that hydroxyl radical is primarily responsible for TCE and PCE degradation; however, 5-20% of their degradation was attributed to a non-hydroxyl radical mechanism. Reactions conducted with the superoxide probe tetranitromethane showed that superoxide generation rates increased with increasing H2O2 doses. These results were confirmed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Therefore, the non-hydroxyl radical pathway for TCE and PCE degradation at H2O2 >= 0.5 M was likely via nucleophilic attack by superoxide. The results of this research demonstrate that contaminants present in the aqueous phase that are reactive with hydroxyl radical require only low doses of H2O2 (<= 0.1 M), but subsurface systems contaminated with species not reactive with hydroxyl radical (e.g., carbon tetrachloride) require H2O2 concentrations >= 0.5 M.

AB Nitrogenous disinfection by-products (N-DBPs) in chlorinated drinking water are receiving increasing attention due to their elevated toxicities. An effective strategy to control the formation of N-DBPs is to reduce their nitrogenous precursors (e.g., amino acids [AAs], believed to be the important N-DBP precursors) before disinfection. So far, little information is available about the effectiveness of conventional microbial degradation at controlling the formation of N-DBPs. In this study, the biodegradability of 20 AAs was investigated, and the impacts of microbial degradation for the selected 6 typical AAs on the formation of N-DBPs (haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides) and traditional carbonaceous DBP (chloroform) were investigated. The results indicated that glycine, arginine, aspartic acid, asparagine, alanine and serine were susceptible to biodegradation, and the formation potentials (FPs) of DBPs were remarkably reduced after biodegradation. The highest chloroform FP reduction rates from tryptophan and tyrosine were 85.4% and 56.2%, respectively. The FPs of dichloroacetonitrile and trichloroacetamide were also reduced after biodegradation of the all selected AA samples during chlor(am)ination. Dichloroacetamide FPs decreased continuously with incubation time during chlorination for phenylalanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, and the mixed AAs, and the highest reduction rates were 78.7%, 74.6%, 46.7% and 35.3% respectively. The results of integrated toxicity analysis indicated that the pre-treatment of microbial degradation significantly decreased the integrated toxicity of DBPs formed from AAs. Moreover, the microbial community analysis revealed that Proteobacteria was predominant at phylum level in the mixed AA sample, and the dominant genera were Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas. Proteobacteria may play an important role in controlling DBP precursor. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Arsenic (As) contamination of groundwater is a public health concern, impacting the lives of approximately 100 million people in India. Chronic exposure to As significantly increases mortality due to the occurrence of several types of cancer, respiratory and cardiac diseases. Uttar Pradesh is a part of the middle Indo-Gangetic plains and has been found to be severely affected by As contamination of groundwater, as established by several small-scale studies. The current study incorporates a hybrid method based on a random forest ensemble algorithm and univariate feature selection using 1473 data points for predicting As in the region. Twenty direct/proxy predictor variables were considered to describe the geochemical environment, aquifer conditions and topography that are responsible for As enrichment in groundwater. The map of As predicted through the hybrid random forest ensemble model shows an overall accuracy of 84.67%. The hybrid random forest model performs better than the univariate, logistic, fuzzy, adaptive fuzzy and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems, which have been widely used for As prediction. The projected number of rural populations at risk due to high As exposure is 12% of the total population of the region, which accounts for 23.48 million people who are at risk. The predictive map provides insight for the regions where future testing campaigns and interventions for mitigation should be prioritized by policymakers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biochars are low-cost and environmental-friendly materials, which are promising in wastewater treatment. In this study, biochars were manufactured from C-phycocyanin extracted (C-CP) Spirulina residue (SDBC) via thermal pyrolysis. Simultaneously, N-doping was also achieved from the protein in the algae for obtaining a high-performance carbocatalyst for peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation. The SDBC yielded large specific surface areas, nitrogen loading, and good conductivity, which demonstrated excellent oxidation efficiencies toward a wide array of aqueous microcontaminants. An in-depth mechanistic study was performed by integrating selective radical scavenging, solvent exchange (H2O to D2O), diverse organic probes, and electrochemical measurement, unveiling that SDBC/PDS did not rely on free radicals or singlet oxygen but a nonradical pathway. PDS intimately was bonded with a biochar (SDBC 900-acid, pyrolysis at 900 degrees C) to form a surface reactive complex that subsequently attacked an organic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) adsorbed on the biochar via an electron-transfer regime. During this process, the SDBC 900-acid played versatile roles in PDS activation, organic accumulation and mediating the electron shuttle from SMX to PDS. This nonradical system can maintain a superior oxidation efficiency in complicated water matrix and long-term stable operation. More importantly, the nonradical species in SDBC 900-acid/PDS system were capable of inactivating the bacteria (Escherichia coli) in wastewater. Therefore, the biochar based nonradical system can provide a mild and high-efficiency strategy for disinfection in waste and drinking water by green carbocatalysis. This study provides not only a value-added biochar catalyst for wastewater purification but also the first insight into the bacteria inactivation via nonradical oxidation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) has been proposed as a sustainable platform to simultaneously achieve wastewater treatment, renewable energy generation and chemicals production. Currently, the CO2 valorization via MES is restricted by the low production rate, while that via electrochemical reduction is limited by the production of Cl products with high efficiency and selectivity. The electrocatalyst-assisted MES could potentially solve these bottlenecks of both MES and electrochemical reduction technology by increasing the production rate and expanding the product range. Here, four types of metals were evaluated for mixed culture-based, electrocatalyst-assisted MES with the fabrication of electrical-biological hybrid cathodes. Cathodes based on In, Zn, Ti and Cu showed high parallelism at 30 A/m(2). However, no parallelism was observed at 50 A/m(2), and only Zn experienced a further increase of the maximum acetic acid production rate (1.23 +/- 0.02 g/L/d, 313 +/- 5 g/m(2)/d) and titer (9.2 +/- 0.1 g/L), with the highest value of the production rate normalized to the project area of the fiber cathodes. Other volatile fatty acids and ethanol were below 0.5 g/L. Moreover, it was the sharp H-2 generation, which mainly caused the fluctuation of coulombic efficiency. The application of such Zn-based electrical-biological hybrid system shall provide a more efficient route for CO2 valorization. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the lack of robust ways to quantify aggregations, fouling of two-foulant aggregations is poorly understood. This work systematically reports the ultrafiltration membrane fouling by aggregations formed from two oppositely charged organic foulants (i.e., humic acid (HA) and lysozyme (LYS)) with the aid of resonance light scattering (RLS) technique. RLS provides an effective approach to detecting the aggregation concentration and reveals that the HA-LYS aggregations were formed at a mass ratio of m(LYS)/m(HA)= 2.77. During the filtration of the mixture of HA and LYS, aggregations over individual foulants were identified to be the main substances deposited on the membrane surface, where the mass of deposition had a good linear relationship with the feed concentration of the aggregations. The HA-LYS aggregations might decrease the total fouling due to their large size, but reduce the fouling reversibility. In the pH range of 5.5-9.2, the pH value had limiting effects on the concentration of HA-LYS aggregations, as well as the consequent fouling. At low ionic strength, the membrane fouling by HA-LYS aggregations decreased as the ionic strength increased due to the reduction of the aggregation concentration. Oppositely, at high ionic strength, this tendency was reversed due to the electrical double layer compression effect. These results suggest that RLS is a simple and effective way to quantify the aggregations of foulants, and the aggregations of foulants have distinct fouling behaviors compared with the individual foulants.

AB Benzophenone derivatives, including benzophenone-1 (C13H10O3, BP1), benzophenone-3 (C14H12O3, BP3) and benzophenone-8 (C14H12O4, BP8), that used as UV filters are currently viewed as emerging contaminants. Degradation behaviors on co-exposure benzophenone derivatives using UV-driven advanced oxidation processes under different aqueous environments are still unknown. In this study, the degradation behavior of mixed benzophenone derivatives via UV/H2O2 and UV/peroxydisulfate (PDS), in different water matrices (surface water, hydrolyzed urine and seawater) were systematically examined. In surface water, the attack of BP3 by hydroxyl radicals (HO center dot) or carbonate radicals (CO3 center dot-) in IN/H2O2 can generate BP8, which was responsible for the relatively high degradation rate of BP3. Intermediates from BP3 and BP8 in UV/PDS were susceptible to CO3 center dot-, bringing inhibition of BP1 degradation. In hydrolyzed urine, Cl- was shown the negligible effect for benzophenone derivatives degradation due to low concentration of reactive chlorine species (RCS). Meanwhile, BP3 abatement was excessively inhibited during co-exposure pattern. In seawater, non-first-order kinetic behavior for BP3 and BP8 was found during UV/PDS treatment. Based on modeling, Br- was the sink for HO center dot, and the co-existence of Br- and Cl- was the sink for SO4 center dot-. The cost-effective treatment toward target compounds removal in different water matrices was further evaluated using EE/O. In most cases, UV/H2O2 process is more economically competitive than UV/PDS process. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The combination of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and electrolysis with an activated carbon fiber (ACF) as cathode (E-ACF-PMS) was systematically investigated. A synergistic effect was observed in the E-ACF-PMS process. Compared with the E-ACF-PDS process, the E-ACF-PMS process spent one-third as much energy for elimination of carbamazepine (CBZ). Increased PMS concentration, current density, and pH value significantly enhanced CBZ elimination. It was also noted that the presence of phosphate (PO43-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), and humic acid (HA) inhibited CBZ removal, while the presence of chloride ion (Cl-) accelerated it. According to radical scavenging experiments and the estimation of relative contribution, reactive oxygen species oxidation (including 'OH, SO4 center dot-, and O-1(2)) played an important role in CBZ degradation, accounting for 75.67%. We systematically explored the production mechanism for O-1(2) and the results demonstrated that O-1(2) was mainly generated on the cathode, rather than generated by O-2(center dot-) or O-2 reported by other researchers. Possible degradation pathways for CBZ in E-ACF-PMS process were also proposed. Finally, the potential for practical applications was explored and compared with E-ACF-PDS. The results of SEM images, BET, and nitrogen adsorption isotherm before and after ACF reuse for 50 times suggested that ACF could maintain its adsorption capacity and catalytic ability in the E-ACF-PMS process. Testing also suggested that the protection of ACF in electrochemical oxidation was based on its relatively high current intensity and removal efficiency. The removal efficiencies of other organic pollutants, including nitrobenzene (NB), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), diclofenac (DC), and tetracycline (TC) were also evaluated. In addition, experiments were conducted to study the effects of different water matrices and toxicology implications and results demonstrated that substituting PMS for PDS in an E-ACF system could create a more efficient, sustainable, and with less secondary toxicity process for wastewater treatment.

AB This study aims at testing the effectiveness of Positive Matrix Factorization in characterizing ground-water and surface water quality, in terms of identifying main hydrochemical features and processes (natural and anthropogenic) that govern them. This method is applied in a hydro-system featured by a strong interrelation between groundwater and surface water and highly impacted by agricultural activities. Therefore, a holistic approach considering groundwater together with the surface water bodies, consisting in lake, several rivers and springs, was used.
   Multivariate statistical analysis, in particular Factor Analysis, has been proved to be effective in elaborating and interpreting water quality data highlighting the information carried within them, but it presents some limitations: it does not consider data uncertainty and it groups variables which are correlated positively and negatively. Moreover, in some cases the resulting factors are not clearly interpretable, describing each one various overlapping features/processes.
   Here, Positive Matrix Factorization is applied to groundwater and surface water quality data, and the results are compared to those obtained through a Factor Analysis in terms of both factor profiles and their spatial distribution through a GIS approach. Results of isotopes analysis are used to validate PMF output and support interpretation. Positive Matrix Factorization allows to consider data uncertainty and the solution respects two positivity constraints, based on the concept of chemical mass balance, which leads to a more environmentally interpretable solution.
   Results show that Positive Matrix Factorization identifies five different factors reflecting main features and natural and anthropogenic processes affecting the study area: 1) surface water used for irrigation, 2) groundwater subjected to reducing processes at advanced stages, 3) groundwater subjected to reducing processes at early stages, 4) groundwater residence time and 5) the effects of the agricultural land use on both groundwater and surface water.
   Positive Matrix Factorization leads to a more detailed understanding of the studied system as compared to Factor Analysis which identifies only three factors with overlapping information. Based on the results of this study, Positive Matrix Factorization could be a useful technique to perform groundwater and surface water quality characterization and to reach a deeper understanding of the phenomena that govern water chemistry.

AB Enhanced biological denitrification for nitrogen removal using sludge alkaline fermentation liquid (SAFL) as an alternative carbon source has been widely reported in previous studies, while limited studies focused on the degradation of the organics presented in SAFL. In this study, an SAFL driven anoxic denitrification sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was established, the mechanism of organics utilization was characterized and the refractory dissolved organic matters (rDOM) was identified. Denitrification could rapidly proceed with the presence of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) initially, while the denitrification rate largely decreased after the VFAs depleted. A great deal of rDOM, which was hard to be utilized by denitrifying microorganism, was found in the effluent. A prolonged hydraulic retention time (HRT) led to the further transformation of particles and colloids to smaller colloids and soluble organics. Extended HRT promoted the degradation of soluble microbial by-product (SMP), but had minor effect on the removal of humic-like, and fulvic acid-like substances. The characterization of the effluent demonstrated the building blocks, were dominated in the rDOM (43.79%-48.78%), followed by high molecular weight protein (HMW-PN) (13.37%-1739%), HMW polysaccharide (HMW-PS) (12.84%-15.9%), low molecular weight (LMW) neutrals (11.28%-13.65%), and hydrophobic dissolved organic carbon (HO-DOC) (8.0%-12.62%). Moreover, it was found that the building blocks were relatively easy to be degraded with the extension of HRTs, followed by LMW-PS, LMW-PN, LMW neutrals, HMW-PN, and HMW-PS. However, further extended HRT >24 h could not improve the removal of building blocks, LMW-PS and LMW neutrals. This study, for the first time, provided insights into the transformation of organic matters produced by SAFL in a denitrification system and acted as a guide for the subsequent advanced treatment.

AB Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have been regarded as an emerging pollutant in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents due to their potential risk to human health and ecological safety when reused for landscape and irrigation. Conventional wastewater treatment processes generally fail to effectively reduce ARGs, especially extracellular ARGs (eARGs), which are persistent in the environment and play an important role in horizontal gene transfer via transformation. Herein, an integrated process of pre-coagulation and microfiltration was developed for removal of ARGs, especially eARGs, from wastewater effluent. Results show that the integrated process could effectively reduce the absolute abundances of total ARGs (tARGs) (>2.9 logs) and eARGs (>5.2 logs) from the effluent. The excellent performance could be mainly attributed to the capture of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and eARGs by pre-coagulation and co-rejection during subsequent microfiltration. Moreover, the integrated process exhibited a good performance on removing common pollutants (e.g., dissolved organic carbon and phosphate) from the effluent to improve water quality. Besides, the integrated process also greatly reduced membrane fouling compared with microfiltration. These findings suggest that the integrated process of pre-coagulation and microfiltration is a promising advanced wastewater treatment technology for ARGs (especially eARGs) removal from WWTP effluents to ensure water reuse security.

AB Floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) are a plant-based treatment technology shown to remove excess nutrients and metals from surface waters under a variety of conditions. Plants established in FTWs can accumulate and store nutrients within their tissues, but the amount of uptake and storage is dependent on plant species and nutrient influent concentration. This research was designed to quantify the influence of nutrient load and two plant species on nutrient uptake and partitioning patterns within plant tissues (shoots and roots) so that management recommendations for FTWs can be developed to better protect surface water quality. Treatments consisted of (1) two nutrient loads: a high concentration of 15 mg.L-1 nitrogen (N) and a low concentration of 5 mg.L-1 N supplied as water soluble fertilizer, and (2) four mesocosm treatments: (a) open water, (b) artificial mat only, no plants, (c) artificial mats planted with Pontederia cordata L, and (d) artificial mats planted with Juncus effusus L. Plant growth, N, and phosphorus (P) uptake of both P. cordata and J. effusus were greater in the high nutrient treatment than in the low. Pontederia cordata facilitated the highest rates of N (0.31 mg.L.day(-1)) and P (0.34 mg.L.day(-1)) removal. The nutrient removal rates facilitated by Juncus effusus in the high nutrient treatment were much lower for both N (0.03 mg.L.day(-1)) and P (0.02 mg.L.day(-1)). Peak N and P accumulation in J. effusus occurred in September within both root (50 g N and 4.8 g P) and shoot tissues (98 g N and 12.5 g P). The uptake of N and P in P. cordata was highest in root tissues in August (307 g N and 30.5 g P) and in shoot tissues in September (1490 g N and 219.5 g P). In both species, shoots accumulated more N and P than the roots, resulting in a small root:shoot ratio at all stages of the experiment. Harvest of plants from FTWs should occur before plants senesce in the fall, which using P. cordata and J. effusus as model species, occurred from mid- to late-September in USDA Hardiness Zone 8a in the Southeastern United States.

AB Algal treatment was combined with ozone pretreatment for treatment of synthetic reverse osmosis concentrate (ROC) prior to microfiltration. The research mainly focused on minimizing the fouling of polyvinylidene-fluoride membranes and maximizing the restoration of membrane permeability. The algal treatment alone was only moderately effective for the mitigation of fouling in microfiltration, while a markedly improved performance was achieved when the algal treatment followed ozonation. The combination of ozonation and algal treatment reduced membrane permeability decline and significantly (p <0.05) increased the reversibility of fouling after hydraulic washing. A longitudinal evaluation was also performed with a goal of achieving a robust removal of contaminants. Ozonation followed by algal treatment was very effective in attenuating both caffeine and carbamazepine, as well as removing organic matter and inorganic nutrients from ROC in a single bioreactor. In this study, an alkaline condition (similar to pH 12), produced by microalgae in the light without supplemental aeration was applied for in situ cleaning of fouled membranes. The result showed that the algal-induced cleaning successfully restored the permeability of organic-fouled membranes during the filtration of both raw and algal treated ROC. This in-situ strategy offers a novel option for periodic cleaning of fouled membranes while maintaining operational simplicity, especially for existing submerged membrane filtration facilities.

AB A compilation and analysis of experimentally determined microbial growth yields for syntrophic volatile fatty acid (VFA), lactate oxidisers and methanogens in anaerobic digestion (AD) systems is presented. Only studies based on experimental determinations or sound model-to-data fitting that specifically address parameter identifiability, have been considered. The experimentally determined values are compared and discussed with estimations based on bioenergetic correlations. Only for acetoclastic methanogens the experimentally determined microbial yields appear in good consistency with bioenergetic estimations. For syntrophic microbial groups, the experimetal yield values reported appear much higher than those expected from the low amount of metabolic energy available. These large deviations imply either inaccuracy on the microbial biomass quantification methods or that the syntrophic interspecies electron transfer occurs under mechanisms, or hydrogen equivalent intermediate activities, much below those ever observed in methanogenic environments. In addition, the microbial growth yield values most widely adopted in AD model applications (those reported in the IWA Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1)) are even higher than the experimental determinations from literature. It is therefore proposed that microbial growth yield values should be restricted by the maximum harvestable ATP calculated through a detailed bioenergetic pathway analysis. Model simulations with different parameter configurations for different yield sources (default ADMI, experimentally determined and bioenergetically estimated values) displayed low sensitivity of the simulations with respect to the yield values as long as the maximum specific microbial growth rate (lima.) remain the same. This suggests that model calibrations could target the accuracy of mu(max) maintaining the bioenergetic upper limit for microbial growth yields. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in municipal wastewater treatment plants represents a real risk to human health. For the first time, this paper shows that the inactivation rate of cefotaxime resistant bacteria is the same as total bacteria when secondary effluents are treated by the solar photo-Fenton process. To obtain this result, an exhaustive and comparative kinetic study on the inactivation of both total and cefotaxime resistant bacteria (Total coliform, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus sp) was carried out, taking into account the effects of the main operation conditions, such as solar irradiance and iron concentration, and operation mode (batch and continuous). In all the operation conditions studied, no significant differences were found between the first order inactivation rate constants, of total and cefotaxime resistant bacteria. Additionally, lc; increased with solar irradiance and iron concentration. As for the effect of the operation mode, the main finding of this work is much quicker inactivation in continuous flow mode than in batch mode, pointing out its potential application at large scale. The best continuous operation condition to inactivate the bacteria to the detection limit (1 CFU mL(-1)), was at 22.4 min of hydraulic residence time with 5 mg Fe2+ L-1 and 30 mg H2O2 center dot L-1. This treatment time is approximately a third of that reported in batch mode. The efficiency, in terms of figure of merits, of the continuous flow operation was 2.7 m(2) of solar collector area to reduce one log of E. coli concentration per m(3) of treated water and per hour, in comparison with 2137 m(2) calculated for batch operation under the same solar UVA irradiance, 30 W m(-2). This paper encourages research into continuous solar disinfection processes due to its enhanced efficiency with regard to the commonly used batch wise operation and shows that efficient removal of total bacteria ensures the removal of antibiotic resistant bacteria.

AB This study addressed whether digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) could improve sensitivity and specificity of human-associated Bacteroidales genetic markers, BacHum and B. theta, and their quantification in environmental and fecal composite samples. Human markers were quantified by qPCR and ddPCR platforms obtained from the same manufacturer. A total of 180 samples were evaluated by each platform including human and animal feces, sewage, and environmental water. The sensitivity of ddPCR and qPCR marker assays in sewage and human stool was 0.85-1.00 with marginal reduction in human stool by ddPCR relative to qPCR (<10%). The prevalence and distribution of markers across complex sample types was similar (74-100% agreement) by both platforms with qPCR showing higher sensitivity for markers in environmental and composite samples and ddPCR showing greater reproducibility for marker detection in fecal composites. Determination of BacHum prevalence in fecal samples by ddPCR increased specificity relative to qPCR (from 0.58 to 0.88) and accuracy (from 0.77 to 0.94), while the B. theta assay performed similarly on both platforms (specificity = 0.98). In silico analysis indicated higher specificity of ddPCR for BacHum was not solely attributed to reduced sensitivity relative to qPCR. Marker concentrations measured by ddPCR for all sample types were consistently lower than those measured by qPCR, by a factor of 2.6 +/- 2.8 for B. theta and 18.7 +/- 10.0 for BacHum. We suggest that differences in assay performance on ddPCR and qPCR platforms may be linked to the characteristics of the assay targets (that is, genes with multiple versus single copies and encoding proteins versus ribosomal RNA) however further work is needed to validate these ideas. We conclude that ddPCR is a suitable tool for microbial source tracking, however, other factors such as cost-effectiveness and assay-specific performance should be considered.

AB In order to better understand the occurrence of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) in tap water and their real impacts on consumers, this study made a one-year long survey of the temporal variations of a series of DBPs before and after a point-of-use (POU) treatment facility installed in a building serving for similar to 300 people. Water samples were collected every week at a fixed location and time for 1 year, and frequent samplings were carried out every 6 h a day for 1 month at selected seasons, which ultimately amounted to 322 samples. The results show that the concentrations of DBPs were higher in the summer than other seasons, with the lowest DBP levels being observed in spring. Within one week, higher levels of halo acetic acids (HAAs) were identified on weekdays than those on weekends. Diurnally, trihalomethanes, HAAs, and haloacetaldehydes were found to be higher at noon but lower in the evening. Consistent with other studies, the variations of most DBP5 were somewhat positively related to the changes of temperature and organic matter, but negatively related to the quantity of free chlorine. With the use of a POU facility, which equips with two activated carbon cartridges and a boiler in sequence, most of DBPs were dramatically reduced, leading to 62-100% lower cytotoxicity for the measured DBPs. The study hence provides a real-water evidence about the DBP occurrences in a typical distribution system endpoint and the efficiency of a typical POU on mitigating DBP risks. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We investigated semiquantitative changes in almost 1000 dissolved organic matter (DOM) features during oxidation with 1 mg of O-3 per liter (mg OA), 4 mg O-3/L, or 4 mg O-3/L + 2.5 mg of H2O2 per liter (advanced oxidation process, AOP) by unknown screening analysis with Orbitrap mass spectrometry. The consequential effects on formation of unknown disinfection by-products (DBPs) by chlorination were evaluated in laboratory-scale experiments. Several hundred unsaturated DOM features with positive oxygen-subtracted double bond equivalents per carbon ((DBE-O)/C) were decomposed by the ozone only treatment and AOP. The AOP decomposed some saturated (negative (DBE-O)/C)) and reduced molecules, which had negative carbon oxidation states (C-os). Several hundred saturated oxidation by-products were detected after ozonation and the AOP. After chlorination, the samples pre-treated with ozone alone resulted in higher formation of unknown DBPs than the AOP pre-treated sample or the sample without oxidation. Over half of the DBP precursors, estimated by electrophilic substitution, were not totally decomposed by any oxidation process, but they were increased after the ozone-only process and AOR DBP precursors produced by the ozone-only process or AOP formed unique unknown DBPs. Therefore, post-treatment processes after oxidation and before chlorination are important to minimize formation of unknown DBPs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria convert ammonium and nitrite into N-2 in a chemolithoautotrophic way, meaning that they utilize CO2/HCO3 solely as their carbon sources. Such autotrophic behavior limits their competitiveness with heterotrophic microorganisms in both natural environments and engineered systems. Recently, environmental metagenomic results have indicated the capability of anammox bacteria to metabolize short-chain fatty acids, further confirmed by limited experimental evidence based on highly enriched cultures. However, clear evidence is difficult to get because of the limits of traditional methodologies which rely on the availability of a pure anammox culture. In this study, we identified and quantified the uptake of acetate and propionate, on a single-cell level, by an anammox consortium that was dominated by Candidatus Jettenia asiatica (relative abundance of 96%). The consortium, growing in granular form with an average relative abundance of anammox bacteria of 96.0%, was firstly incubated in a(13)C-labelled acetate or propionate medium; then microtome sections were scanned by a nanometer-scale secondary ion mass spectrometer (NanoSIMS). The NanoSIMS scannings revealed that the consortium enriched acetate and propionate at a >10 times higher efficiency than bicarbonate incorporation. Our results also suggest that acetate or propionate was likely not assimilated by J. asiatica directly, but firstly oxidized to CO2, which then served as carbon sources for the follow-up autotrophy in J. asiatica cells. Furthermore, more [N-15]ammonium was enriched by the propionate-fed consortium than the acetate-fed consortium despite that exactly the same amount of C-13 atoms were supplied. Our study strongly indicates an alternative lifestyle, namely organotrophy, in addition to chemolithoautotrophy of anammox bacteria, making it more versatile than often expected. It suggests that the niche of anammox bacteria in both natural and engineered ecosystems can be much broader than usual assumed. Recognising this is important for their role in wastewater treatment and the global nitrogen turn-over rates. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
