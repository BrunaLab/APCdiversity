AB Ag3PO4 nanospheres were simply prepared by chemical precipitation method through introducing a little amount of NaHCO3 into the NaH2PO4 solution at room temperature. NaHCO3 mainly increased the amount of Ag3PO4 crystalline nucleus and reduced the grain size of Ag3PO4 finally. Ag3PO4 nanospheres had weaker crystallinity and visible light absorption ability, however, it achieved much higher photocatalytic activity than Ag3PO4 microspheres for contaminants elimination under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm). The enhanced activity of Ag3PO4 nanospheres was testified by transient photocurrent and photoluminescence spectra. This is a facile and rapid synthesis method to obtain Ag3PO4 nanospheres with excellent and stable visible light activity. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The adhesion strength and microstructure of single splats significantly influence the properties of cold sprayed coatings. Here, we compare the adhesion strength and microstructural changes of Ti6Al4V spherical powder (SP) particles with a martensitic microstructure and irregular powder (IP) particles with an equiaxed microstructure deposited by cold spray (CS). Splat adhesion tests were performed to determine the adhesion strength and electron channelling contrast imaging was done for microstructural analysis of splat cross-sections. IP splats formed a continuous bonded interface with the substrate resulting in a greater adhesion strength when compared to SP splats. IP splat cross-sections revealed ultrafine grains (UFG) near the interface followed by a highly deformed microstructure. SP splat cross-sections also showed UFG at the interface but largely retained the initial microstructure in the top portion of the splat due to poor deformability. The irregular morphology of the IP led to more adherent deposits while the equiaxed microstructure resulted in highly deformed post spray microstructures. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Polyaniline/cellulous-derived highly porous activated carbons (PANI/C-ACs) composites have been synthesized for high-performance supercapacitors via a simple and economical method. The obtained three-dimensional and hierarchical porous structure of PANI/C-ACs, not only exhibited high specific surface area and electron conductivity, but also promoted electrolyte ion transportation, facilitated fast and stable surface redox reactions, hence synergistically improved the overall capacitive performance. The as-designed PANI/C-ACs composites exhibited a specific capacitance of 765 F/g at 1 A/g and capacitance retention of two-electrode cell was as high as 91% after 5000 cycles. Moreover, evident pseudocapacitive behavior can be well maintained at high current densities, indicating superior rate capability for these hierarchically structured composites, making them promising electrode materials for high performance supercapacitors.

AB This work reports the strain dependence of the offset voltage in an AlGaN/GaN van der Pauw device under mechanical strain. The AlGaN/GaN heterostructure was grown on a sapphire (0 0 0 1) wafer by using a metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) process. Taking advantage of the four-terminal configuration, the fabricated van der Pauw device exhibited an excellent repeatability and linearity with a significant change of the offset voltage under application of tensile and compressive strains. In particular, the sensitivity of the device to the applied strain was found to be as large as 3 (mu V/V)/ppm, indicating the feasibility of using this effect for mechanical sensing applications. The sensing mechanism of the device is explained via the alteration of the sheet carrier concentration at the AlGaN/GaN interface and the asymmetric current flux in the 2DEG van der Pauw device.

AB In this study, heat treatment and extrusion were used respectively to optimize the microstructure of a novel Mg-2Y-1Zn-0.4Zr alloy, and its mechanical property, degradation behavior and cytocompatibility were investigated. Stress-strain curves showed that both heat treatment and extrusion could improve the mechanical properties of the alloy. Electrochemical results indicated that, comparing with as-cast specimen, the heat treated and as-extruded samples showed lower corrosion rate and less susceptibility to pitting corrosion. The cytotoxicity was evaluated using the methylthiazolyl diphenyltetrazolium bromide method via mouse fibroblast L929 cells. The results revealed that the cytocompatibility of Mg-2Y-1Zn-0.4Zr alloy was enhanced by heat treatment and extrusion. Besides, as-extruded alloy showed favorable mechanical property, the best degradation behavior and cytocompatibility which suggests that as-extruded may be a good candidate to be used in biomedical applications.

AB The micro-sized materials have low processing difficulty, which ought to be more suited for practical applications. Here, a novel micron-sized NiCo2O4 pompon is first obtained by the synergistic effect observed in the co-template method. The obtained product has a larger specific surface area of 109.62 m(2)/g and higher pore volume of 0.30 cm(3)/g than that of blank sample. Aided by the unique morphological superiority, it exhibits high specific capacitance of 2201.7 F/g at 2 A/g, good rate performance of 1296.8 F/g even at 20 A/g, and desirable cyclic stability of 14.2% degradation over 3000 continuous cycles at 10 A/g. The performance is better compared to most NiCo2O4 electrodes in similar reports. The co-templates controlled synthesis shows advantages of simpleness, practicality and high efficiency, and should bring high application value in electrode synthesis. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB A nanocomposite with mesoporous Co3O4 loaded on nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon (Co3O4@NMC) has been constructed by a facile post-grinding process. The electro-catalytic experimental results show that Co3O4@NMC (1:3) can be regarded as the low-cost alternative ORR/OER bi-functional catalyst compared with commercial noble Pt/C + IrO2 catalysts. The potential difference (Delta E) between between E-1/2 and E-j10 for Co3O4@NMC (1:3) sample is only 21 mV larger. Moreover, we observed no obvious degeneration in both ORR and OER activity during ADT tests. The enhancement of electro-catalytic activity can be attributed to the effective charge transfer process as suggested by the Tafel analysis due to the synergistic effect. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The effect of twins in secondary hardening ultrahigh-strength steel (UHSS) on the precipitation of carbides is unclear. In this study, secondary hardening UHSS Ferrium S53 was studied both before and after an aging treatment. The morphology and distribution of twins and their role during the aging process were analyzed and discussed. The results show that three types of twins are found in the sample before aging, and the twin interfaces become the most favorable nucleation sites for precipitates during aging. The precipitates in Ferrium S53 are M2C carbides that possess the following orientation relationship with the matrix: [2 1 1] M2C//[1 3 5]alpha and (1 1 1) M2C//(1 2 1)alpha. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, we report the experimental observation of five-fold annealing twin in the nanocrystalline Au/Pd thin film without external stress by annealing the film for 20 min at 473 K using atomic-resolution high angle annular dark field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) employing Cs aberration-corrected electron microscopy. As per the knowledge of the authors, this is the first time that five-fold annealing twin has been observed for Au/Pd thin films. Furthermore, the spectroscopic elemental analysis shows the uniform distribution of palladium in the film, indicating no palladium grain boundary segregation. Strain analyses have been performed by geometric phase analysis (GPA) across the five-fold structures. GPA method shows the non-uniform strain distribution across the various segments of the five-fold structure. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These CMTFs not only exhibit superior transmittance and low resistance (a sheet resistance of 0.5 Omega sq(-1) at similar to 80% transmittance), but also demonstrate remarkable mechanical properties after bending test and high catalytic activity towards I /I-3 redox in DSSCs. What is more, a novel photoelectrochromic smart window (PECSW) with large color range is successfully fabricated and its transmittance can be automatically adjusted by the CMTF based DSSCs according to the intensity of sunlight.

AB ZSM-22 hollow spheres (ZSM-22-HSs) were fabricated by a novel two-stage hydrothermal method. The structure of the zeolites were characterized by XRD, XRF, SEM, TEM and N-2 adsorption-desorption. ZSM-22 nanorods were formed in first-stage crystallization, and self-assembled to form hollow spheres with intercrystalline mesopores in second-stage crystallization assisted by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. Hierarchical pore structures for ZSM-22-HSs was also well developed by this method. The formation of these ZSM-22-HSs may be due to the developed grain boundaries of ZSM-22 nanorods.

AB Structural, electronic and hydrogen storage properties of Ti-doped boron(B)/nitrogen(N) substituted benzene complexes are studied and compared with Ti-doped benzene (BTi) complex using ab initio calculations. The H-2 uptake capacity is increased and decreased for B-substituted BTi (BBTi) and N-substituted BTi (BNTi) complexes respectively than that for BTi complex. However, H-2 molecules interact more strongly with BNTi than BTi and BBTi complexes. The BBTi is an electron deficient structure and accepts an additional electron which is responsible for the adsorption of one extra H-2 molecule than BTi and BNTi complexes. More number of states are introduced above the highest occupied molecular orbitals after B-substitution than N-substitution. The charge on Ti in BBTi is more positive than BTi and BNTi complexes. There is a Kubas type interaction between adsorbed H-2 molecules and Ti atom for all the complexes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Silicon-graphene composites show large lithium capacity and very small volume expansion during charge processes. However, further study on atomic structure-property relationship of the system is very challenging for current experimental technologies. In this work, the lithiation mechanism of silicon-graphene electrode is investigated by first principle calculations. The calculated densities of states indicate that Si/Gra with higher Si concentration is more energetically favorable for Li incorporation. The formation of Si-C bonds near silicon-graphene interface and C-Li bonds near graphene layers is considered as the main origin of irreversible capacity loss, and a reversible capacity is obtained by excluding the Li atoms related to the irreversible atomic structures. The predicted reversible capacity of Si/Gra(1) (75.7 wt% Si) is 2383 mAhg(-1), which is comparable to reversible capacity of 2497 mAhg(-1) for the composite with similar composition (72 wt% Si) in experiment.

ID NB3AL PRECURSOR STRAND
AB In order to reduce the long-term annealing process and prevent excessive grain growth, we attempted to fabricate MgB2 superconducting wires by the rapid heating and quenching (RHQ) method. In this paper, we have successfully prepared MgB2 superconductive wires with self-made RHQ equipment, and the effect of various Joule heating currents on the properties of MgB2 was investigated. The XRD results showed that the sample had relatively strongest diffraction peaks and least heterogenous peaks when the loading heating current was 350 A, so the superconducting transition temperature (T-c) could reach 38.5 K. Because the MgB2 phase particles were small and uniformly distributed, there was a good critical current density (J(c)). That is, in the self-field, the J(c) value of the 350 A sample reached up to 1.39 x 10(5) A/cm(2), and the downward trend was the flattest. When the magnetic field was 7 T, the critical current density was still as high as 300 A/cm(2). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Results show that the Zn-2Cu alloy consisted of Zn matrix and CuZn5 phase, but TiZn16 phase newly formed with Ti addition. As Ti content increased, CuZn5 phase was further refined; TiZn16 phase gradually changed from fibrous to discontinuous reticular morphology.

AB Graphitic mesoporous carbon (GMC) supported Ce-doped nickel catalyst was prepared by a simple incipient wetness impregnation and calcination method. The catalytic performance of the prepared catalyst was tested by catalytic steam reforming of toluene (a biomass tar model compound). Compared with mesoporous SBA-15 supported catalyst, the GMC supported catalyst has a higher toluene conversion efficiency of 98% at 700 degrees C and remained stable during 24 h of continuous reaction. The excellent catalytic performance is mainly attributed to the better dispersion of Ni nanoparticles on GMC support and the reduced carbon deposition because of the Ce-doping. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB A coaxial poly(phthalazinone ether sulfone ketone)/polyvinylidene fluoride fibrous membrane used for lithium-ion batteries was prepared by the electrospinning technique. The suitable processing parameters were chosen to obtain the core PPESK fibers with small diameter and shell PVDF fibers with large diameter simultaneously. The prepared coaxial PPESK/PVDF fibrous membranes exhibit superior thermal shutdown property and thermal dimensional stability. Meanwhile, the coaxial PPESK/PVDF membranes show larger porosity, better electrolyte wettability and higher ionic conductivity in comparison with the commercial PP/PE/PP separators. In addition, the coins cells using coaxial PPESK/PVDF membranes show excellent cycle performance, which demonstrates the membranes have the potential to be used as separators for high-performance lithium-ion batteries.

AB Selenium has received increasing attention as a potential alternative to sulfur cathode for rechargeable lithium batteries because of its high electronic conductivity and better electrochemical performance. However, the shuttle effect of polyselenides in lithium-selenium batteries, similar to that of polysulfides in lithium-sulfur batteries, is still one of the main drawbacks. Here, we designed and synthesized a new pomegranate-like porous carbon/Se (PPC/Se) cathode that could effectively improve the shuttle effect of polyselenides. The pomegranate-like carbon nanoparticles used as the host materials for Se were prepared via carbonization of well-assembled ketjen black nanosubunits. The batteries assembled with such new-synthesized PPC/Se cathodes exhibit relatively high specific capacity of 380 mA h g(-1) at 1 C and high Coulombic efficiency of similar to 98% due to the restrained dissolution of polyselenides.

AB Nanoporous carbon (NPC) composites embedded with magnetic nanoparticles have been widely studied for applications in microwave absorption. Herein, highly porous rambutan-like carbon composites decorated with controllable carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and Co nanoparticles were synthesized through a thermal decomposition of Co-doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-8 (ZIF-8) under different temperatures. The MOF-derived carbon nanocomposites with the cobalt content accounting for 30% of the total mass of cobalt and zinc, carbonized at 700 degrees C, exhibited excellent microwave absorption property of -30.2 dB. Characterizations exhibit that the in-situ generated Co nanoparticles are uniformly embedded into NPC matrix, which are surrounded by highly graphitized CNTs. The research presents a facile and promising route for rapid mass production of metal-doped NPC/CNTs composites for high-efficiency microwave absorption. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dye sensitized solar cells are promising class of photovoltaic cells with the capability of generating green energy at low production cost since no expensive equipment is required in their fabrication. Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods were synthesized by hydrothermal method and their performance as photoanodes in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with dye extracts from fruits of Phytolacca icosandra and Phyllanthus reticulatus as sensitizers was analyzed. Detailed structural and surface characterization of the ZnO nanorods were accomplished using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM). XRD results revealed that the synthesized ZnO material exhibited hexagonal crystal structure which was found to be highly stable and crystallite. The dye extracts were subjected to UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis. The short-circuit photocurrent; the open-circuit photovoltage, and the power conversion efficiency of DSSC were measured using J-V measurement system. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A hybrid membrane successfully fabricated via chemical vapor deposition can be used as a visible-light photocatalyst to effectively degrade water-soluble methylene dye. High pyrolysis temperatures cause urea precursor to form thin g-C3N4 nanosheets and to grow on the surface of carbonized cellulose-based filter paper, which functions as a stable substrate and charge transfer carrier. Via oxygen plasma treatment, the hybrid membrane exhibits wettability in water, which is beneficial in terms of adsorbing organic pollutions. Consequently, as a static photocatalyst and flow-through membrane, it presents higher levels of photocatalytic activity for degrading methylene blue. Meanwhile, the hybrid membrane maintains a steady flux and high levels of degrade efficiency after 5 cycles under visible-light irradiation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present work is focused on the antibacterial potentials, tribological properties and corrosion resistances of silver (Ag) or nitrogen (N)-doped diamond-like carbon (DLC) films deposited by a hybrid ion beam deposition system onto titanium substrates that were pretreated by micro arc oxidation (MAO). The results revealed that the DLC and N-DLC films had remarkable sealing effects on the porous MAO-coated substrate. Although the MAO/(Ag:N)-DLC coating still presented porous features, it had the lowest average wear rate of all the samples (4.40 x 10(-16) m(3)/N.m) in an SBF solution and eradicated 100% of the E. coli bacteria. The corrosion current density (1.06 x 10(-10) A/cm(2)) of the MAO/DLC coating was two orders of magnitude greater than that of the other three coatings. It can be speculated that doped DLC films deposited onto MAO-coated substrates could significantly reduce the risk of the titanium implant. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the attempt of developing post-lithium technologies for electrochemical energy storage devices, rechargeable batteries based on fluoride shuttle have recently attracted attention due to the perspective of achieving high energy densities. In this study, we present relatively high voltage room temperature rechargeable fluoride ion batteries (FIBs) using a liquid electrolyte. FIBs were built using LiPF6 as an electrolyte, Mg + MgF2 as an anode, and BiF3 and SnF2 as cathodes. We have investigated two types of FIB systems such as Mg+MgF2/LiPF6/BiF3, and Mg+MgF2/LiPF6/SnF2 at room temperature. The electrochemical analyzes were performed on sealed steel case coin cells containing a FIB pellet. A current density of 38 mu A cm(-2) was applied. First discharge capacities of 160 and 185 mA.h.g(-1) were obtained for the Mg+MgF2/LiPF6/BiF3 and Mg+MgF2/LiPF6/SnF2 electrochemical systems, respectively. The reaction mechanisms of these FIBs were investigated by X-ray diffraction, impedance measurements, cyclic voltammetry and constant current battery cycling. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Laser welding of TC4 titanium alloy and AISI 316L stainless steel was performed by inserting Cu/Nb bilayer. If high laser power was employed, microstructure of fusion zone of titanium alloy side was mainly composed of (Nb, Ti) solid solution, and Ti-Cu phases would be produced near fusion zone between Cu and Nb. If relatively low laser power was applied, the formation of cracks could be slightly inhibited, and microstructure in fusion zone between Cu and Nb was replaced by (Cu, Nb) solid solution. Owing to the formation of cracks, maximum tensile strength of weld joints was only 114 MPa. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel high-entropy oxides (i.e. multiple-cation solid solutions with high configurational entropies) with the composition of 10La(2)O(3)-20TiO(2)-10Nb(2)O(5)-20WO(3)-20ZrO(2) (LTNWZ) were successfully prepared by containerless solidification through aerodynamic levitation. The glass transition temperature T-g was 688 degrees C and the crystallization onset temperature T-x was 757 degrees C, between which the difference (Delta T) was 69 degrees C. The Vicker's hardness of LTNWZ glass was 6.8 GPa. The area of transmission largely ranged from 354 nm to 7.28 mu m wavelength. In this area, the glass remained colorless and optically transparent. The optical energy gap E-opt was about 3.18 eV. The refractive index of as-prepared glass was 2.22 which was much higher than those of most optical glasses, and the Abbe number was 61 in the visible light range. In conclusion, the LTNWZ systems have potential applications from the visible to infrared region. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Monolayer graphene with high quality was synthesized by pyrolysis of 6H-silicon carbide single crystal in a medium frequency induction heating furnace. The obtained graphene was systematically studied via Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The characterized results showed that monolayer graphene with high quality was obtained when the growth temperature, Ar flow, and growth pressure was 2000 degrees C, 150 sccm, and 15 Torr, respectively. Our results showed that growth temperature, Ar flow, and growth pressure had great influence on the quality of the obtained monolayer graphene. Compared with the conventional monolayer graphene preparation methods, our method is simple, controllable, and repeatable, which greatly expands the application prospect of graphene.

AB The near-infrared band luminescence from Er3+/Pr3+/Nd3+ tri-doped tellurite glasses were investigated in this work. The tellurite glasses were prepared by melt-quenching method and under the excitation of 488 nm laser, an ultra-broadband emission from 1260 to 1650 nm with FWHM about 256 nm was found to appear owing to the perfect overlapping of emission bands from Er3+, Pr3+ and Nd3+, respectively. Additionally, the studied tellurite glasses possess high glass transition temperature with T-g > 420 degrees C. The ultra-broadband and flat emission properties as well as good thermal stability indicates that Er3+/Pr3+/Nd3+ tri-doped tellurite glass has great application prospect in near-infrared band broadband fiber amplifiers.

AB Mesoporous ZnO was successfully synthesized via nanocasting method using the disordered mesoporous carbon as a hard template. The structure and chemical composition of the sample were characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. A study on their gas sensing properties for NO2 reveals that the sensor utilizing mesoporous ZnO displays low detection concentration, high response, good selectivity, fast response behaviour toward NO2. It is supposed that the outstanding gas sensing properties of mesoporous ZnO sensor is arisen from the large surface area and high porosity, which lead to highly effective surface interaction on between the target gas molecules and the surface active sites in mesoporous ZnO sensor.

Structural elucidation of prepared ferrites, carrired out using X-ray Diffraction, confirms the purity of spinel phase. Effect of Mn-Zr amount on the structural parameters is studied. Morphological characterization evidences that increase in doping amount leads to increased uniformity of grains. Electromagnetic and absorption properties of prepared ferrites are investigated in X-band (8.2-12.4 GHz). Effects of grain size and porosity on X-band properties are scrutinized thoroughly.

AB Al and Al alloys electrodeposited from a dimethylsulfone (DMSO2) bath are typically contaminated with S and Cl. Electrodeposited Al and Al alloys suffer from limited ductility since undesired impurities decrease plastic deformability. Herein, we report an electrodeposition process involving the use of a DMSO2 bath that realizes an Al product with tensile elongation as large as similar to 30%. Doping of tin chloride in the DMSO2 bath resulted in a micrometer-scale grain microstructure with sub-mu m Sn precipitates distributed along the grain boundaries of the electrodeposited Al. These Sn precipitates on the electrodeposits prevented S and Cl contamination, which is likely the main factor underlying the large tensile elongation in the electrodeposited Al. Furthermore, electrodeposition with varying concentrations of tin chloride pointed to that tin chloride showed enough impurities reducing ability even in trace amounts. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ID HYDROXYAPATITE
AB Porous fluorhydroxyapatite (FHA)/magnesium (Mg)/gelatin (Gel) scaffolds with various amounts of FHA (30, 40, 50 wt%) were fabricated through freeze-drying procedure. Microscopic investigations indicated a porous microstructure with pores diameter in the range of 150-250 mu m, which is acceptable for osteoblastic cells to proliferate. Additionally, successful replacement of fluorine ion in the structure of hydroxyapatite and suitable incorporation of compounds in the scaffolds were verified. Hence increasing the amount of fluohydroxyapatite in the structure of scaffolds has also played a significant role in improving mechanical properties and promoting biological aspects. The results showed that using Mg, Gel and FHA as a fuctional compound, due to the development of non-toxic aspects and mechanical properties, can lead to a massive evolution in bone tissue engineering applications.

AB In this study, the effect of grain size and precipitates on tensile properties of Zn-1.0Cu alloy were investigated. The alloy was cold rolled and annealed to manipulate the grain size and precipitation of CuZn4 particles at grain boundaries. Cold rolling resulted in an almost ultrafine-grained structure alongside precipitation of nano-sized CuZn4 particles. Strain induced precipitates triggered room temperature superplasticity through activation of Zn/CuZn4 boundary sliding, exhibiting maximum elongation of 470% at the strain rate of 1.0 x 10(-4) s(-1). Short-time annealing led to significantly reduced strain rate sensitivity due to the reduction of CuZn4 fraction, while the grain size remained nearly intact. This suggests that precipitates rather than grain size mainly influence the mechanical properties of Zn alloys. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the formation mechanism of graphite nanospheres (GNS) in W-C-Co system under high current pulsed electron beam (HCPEB) irradiation is necessary for its application on surface modification of WC-Co cemented carbide. With this aim, XRD, SEM, EDS and TEM were used to investigate the effect of HCPEB irradiation on surface microstructure and phase composition. Results showed the micro-WC grains and Co were melted and transformed into nano-grained composite structure in the surface layer similar to 1.29 mu m. Two general scales of GNS were discerned in two types of element composition ambiences, i.e. similar to 100 nm in Co-rich region and similar to 50 nm in Co-poor region. Thermodynamic analysis suggested that they were the results of different routes in the non-equilibrium melting and re-solidification process. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present a design for a sensitive, label-free nanoparticle sensor based on triple-layer-coated microsphere resonators. The surfaces of the microsphere structure are coated with three layers that have high, low, and high refractive indexes from inside to outside, respectively. We theoretically and numerically investigate two cladding modes, we call the inner mode and outer mode. The resonance wavelengths of the two modes are used to detect the resonance wavelength shift caused by a single-nanoparticle. Numerical calculation suggests that if we change the thickness of the middle layer, the device offers another degree of freedom to obtain higher detection sensitivity. We build a model to accurately describe a nanoparticle close to the microsphere. The method for the sensors may promote the design of biosensing applications. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A new decision-aiding approach for multiple criteria sorting problems is proposed for considering the non-monotonic relationship between the preference and evaluations of the alternatives on specific criteria. The approach employs a value function as the preference model and requires the decision maker (DM) to provide assignment examples of a subset of reference alternatives as preference information. We assume that the marginal value function of a non-monotonic criterion is non-decreasing up to the criterion's most preferred level, and then it is non-increasing. For these non-monotonic criteria, the approach starts with linearly increasing and decreasing marginal value functions but then allows such functions to deviate from the linearity and switches them to more complex ones. We develop several algorithms to help the DM resolve the inconsistency in the assignment examples and assign non-reference alternatives. The algorithms not only incorporate the DM's evolving cognition of the preference, but also take into account the trade-offs between the capacity for satisfying incremental preference information and the complexity of the preference model. The DM is guided to evaluate the results at each iteration and then provides reactions for the subsequent iterations so that the proposed approach supports the DM to work out a satisfactory preference model.

AB Interactive image segmentation is a topic of many studies in image processing. In a conventional approach, a user marks some pixels of the object(s) of interest and background, and an algorithm propagates these labels to the rest of the image. This paper presents a new graph-based method for interactive segmentation with two stages. In the first stage, nodes representing pixels are connected to their k-nearest neighbors to build a complex network with the small-world property to propagate the labels quickly. In the second stage, a regular network in a grid format is used to refine the segmentation on the object borders. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method can perform the task with high accuracy. Computer simulations are performed using some real-world images to show its effectiveness in both two classes and multi-classes problems. It is also applied to all the images from the Microsoft GrabCut dataset for comparison, and the segmentation accuracy is comparable to those achieved by some state-of-the-art methods, while it is faster than them. In particular, it outperforms some recent approaches when the user input is composed only by a few "scribbles" draw over the objects. Its computational complexity is only linear on the image size at the best-case scenario and linearithmic in the worst case. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Clustering of multi-view data has received increasing attention since it explores multiple views of data sets aiming at improving clustering accuracy. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a well-known population-based meta-heuristic successfully used in cluster analysis. This paper introduces two hybrid clustering methods for multi-view relational data. These hybrid methods combine PSO and hard clustering algorithms based on multiple dissimilarity matrices. These methods take advantage of the global convergence ability of PSO and the local exploitation of hard clustering algorithms in the position update step, aiming to improve the balance between exploitation and exploration processes. Moreover, the paper provides adapted versions of 11 fitness functions suitable for vector data aiming at dealing with multi-view relational data. Two performance criteria were used to evaluate the clustering quality using the two proposed methods over eleven real-world data sets including image and document data sets. Among new findings, it was observed that the top three fitness functions are Silhouette index, Xu index and Intra-cluster homogeneity. The performance of the proposed algorithms was compared with previous single and multi-view relational clustering algorithms. The results show that the proposed methods significantly outperformed the other algorithms in the majority of cases. The results reinforce the importance of the application of techniques such as PSO-based clustering algorithms in the field of expert systems and machine learning. Such application enhances classification accuracy and cluster compactness. Besides, the proposed algorithms can be useful tools in content-based image retrieval systems, providing good categorizations and automatically learning relevance weights for each cluster of images and sets of views.

AB It is a very challenging and important task to adaptively adjust the scale factor F and the crossover rate Cr for Differential Evolutionary (DE) algorithms. Most recent adaptive techniques were designed to generate parameters randomly based on successful trial values during the previous evolving process, lacking explicit guidelines to generate appropriate values. This paper proposes a novel parameter adaption strategy, which could incorporate promising F and Cr pairs extracted by using Association Rule Mining (ARM) into DE algorithms. First, all successful F and Cr values generated by their original methods are recorded during the whole evolution, resulting in an increasing dataset. Second, we discretize the dataset and extract the most frequent itemset of parameters by using a modified version of the widely used Apriori algorithm. Third, a greedy operator is developed to generate new parameters in the next generation by comparing the presented ARM-based and original-method-based fitness values. The presented technique provides an additional pair of F and Cr values to be evaluated, without replacing existing strategies for the control parameters. The main contribution of this paper is that we propose a novel way, which utilizes information generated during the evolutionary process, to enhance exploration capabilities by adjusting control parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ARM-based parameter adaptive strategy is able to enhance performances of some state-of-the-art DE variants. Further, this methodology might be helpful for other control parameters of Evolutionary Algorithms (EA). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms have been widely used to provide personalized recommendations in e-commerce websites and social network applications. Among them, Matrix Factorization (MF) is one of the most popular and efficient techniques. However, most MF-based recommender models only rely on the past transaction information of users, so there is inevitably a data sparsity problem. In this article, we propose a novel recommender model based on matrix factorization and semantic similarity measure. Firstly, we propose a new semantic similarity measure based on semantic information in the Linked Open Data (LOD) knowledge base, which is a hybrid measure based on feature and distance metrics. Then, we make an improvement on the traditional MF model to deal with data sparsity. Specifically, the MF process has been extended from both the user and item sides with implicit feedback information and semantic similar items, respectively. Experiments on two real datasets show that our proposed semantic similarity measure and recommender model are superior to the state-of-the-art approaches in recommendation performance.

AB The Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm is a popular algorithm in motion planning problems. The optimal RRT (RRT*) is an extended algorithm of RRT, which provides asymptotic optimality. This paper proposes Quick-RRT* (Q-RRT*), a modified RRT* algorithm that generates a better initial solution and converges to the optimal faster than RRT*. Q-RRT* enlarges the set of possible parent vertices by considering not only a set of vertices contained in a hypersphere, as in RRT*, but also their ancestry up to a user-defined parameter, thus, resulting in paths with less cost than those of RRT*. It also applies a similar technique to the rewiring procedure resulting in acceleration of the tendency that near vertices share common parents. Since the algorithm proposed in this paper is a tree extending algorithm, it can be combined with other sampling strategies and graph-pruning algorithms. The effectiveness of Q-RRT* is demonstrated by comparing the algorithm with existing algorithms through numerical simulations. It is also verified that the performance can be further enhanced when combined with other sampling strategies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the success of the electronic recruitment, now it is easier to find a job offer and apply for it. However, due to this same success, nowadays, human resource managers tend to receive high volumes of applications for each job offer. These applications turn into large quantities of documents, known as resumes or curricula vitae, that need to be processed quickly and correctly. To reduce the time necessary to process the resumes, human resource managers have been working with the scientific community to create systems that automate their ranking. Until today, most of these systems are based on the comparison of job offers and resumes. Nevertheless, this comparison is impossible to do in data sets where job offers are no longer available, as it happens in this work. We present two methods to rank resumes that do not use job offers or any semantic resource, unlike existing state-of-the-art systems. The methods are based on what we call Inter-R sum Proximity, which is the lexical similarity between only resumes sent by candidates in response to the same job offer. Besides, we propose the use of Relevance Feedback, at general and lexical levels to improve the ranking of resumes. Relevance Feedback is applied using techniques based on similarity coefficients and vocabulary scoring. All the methods have been tested on a large corpus of 171 real selection processes, which correspond to more than 14,000 resumes. The developed methods can rank correctly, in average, 93% of the resumes sent to each job posting. The outcomes presented here show that it is not necessary to use job offers or semantic resources to provide high quality results. Furthermore, we observed that resumes have particular characteristics that as ensemble, work as a facial composite and provide more information about the job posting than the job offer. This certainly will change how systems analyze and rank resumes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The sine cosine algorithm (SCA) is a relatively novel population-based optimization technique that has been proven competitive with other algorithms and it has received significant interest from researchers in different fields. However, similar to other population-based algorithms, SCA tends to be trapped in local optima and unbalanced exploitation. Additionally, to our limited knowledge, the present SCA and its variants have not been applied to the high-dimensional global optimization problems. This paper presents an improved version of the SCA (ISCA) for solving high-dimensional problems. A modified position-updating equation by introducing inertia weight is proposed to accelerate convergence and avoid falling into the local optima. In addition, to balance the exploration and exploitation of the SCA, we present a new nonlinear conversion parameter decreasing strategy based on the Gaussian function. The effectiveness of the proposed ISCA is evaluated using 24 benchmark high-dimensional (D=30, 100, 500, 1000, and 5000) functions, large-scale global optimization problems from the IEEE CEC2010 competition, and several real world engineering applications. The comparisons show that the proposed ISCA can better escape from local optima with faster convergence than both the traditional SCA and other population-based algorithms.

AB This work presents a text mining context and its use for a deep analysis of the messages delivered by politicians. Specifically, we deal with an expert systems-based exploration of the rhetoric dynamics of a large collection of US Presidents' speeches, ranging from Washington to Trump. In particular, speeches are viewed as complex expert systems whose structures can be effectively analyzed through rank-size laws. The methodological contribution of the paper is twofold. First, we develop a text mining-based procedure for the construction of the dataset by using a web scraping routine on the Miller Center website - the repository site collecting the speeches. Second, we explore the implicit structure of the discourse data by implementing a rank-size procedure over the individual speeches, being the words of each speech ranked in terms of their frequencies. The scientific significance of the proposed combination of text mining and rank-size approaches can be found in its flexibility and generality, which let it be reproducible to a wide set of expert systems and text mining contexts. The usefulness of the proposed method and of the speeches analysis is demonstrated by the findings themselves. Indeed, in terms of impact, it is worth noting that interesting conclusions of social, political and linguistic nature on how 45 United States Presidents, from April 30, 1789 till February 28, 2017 delivered political messages can be carried out. Indeed, the proposed analysis shows some remarkable regularities, not only inside a given speech, but also among different speeches. Moreover, under a purely methodological perspective, the presented contribution suggests possible ways of generating a linguistic decision-making algorithm. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper considers a scheduling problem of processing jobs on two uniform parallel machines. The objective is to minimize total tardiness, subject to the constraint that the total cost cannot exceed a given threshold. The problem is NP-hard even if there is no constraint on machine cost. Two machines are defined, one being fast with a higher processing cost and the other being slow with a lower processing cost. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model is established for the problem. We propose two heuristics with an improvement procedure to obtain initial solutions. To improve the quality of initial solutions, an algorithm based on simulated annealing (SA) approach is developed. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested through random data and evaluated against optimal solutions obtained by Cplex. The results indicate that the algorithm is efficient and performs well. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We propose a new heuristic algorithm for the well-known Orienteering Problem, which aims at maximising the prize collected at vertices of a graph, visiting them through a simple closed tour whose length (also known as travel time) is limited by an upper bound. The algorithm is based on the Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search metaheuristic paradigm, and uses a clustering of the graph to operate on groups of nearby vertices. Extensive computational results show that the proposed algorithm is able to find very good solutions (it produced 27 new best known solutions on a set of benchmark instances) and that it fares favourably compared with other state-of-the-art heuristics when tested with both long and short computation time budgets.

AB Longstanding diabetes mellitus is today known as the primary reason for kidney failure in the patients having that condition. While the prior research has studied the confounding role of some frequently prescribed diabetes medications in developing acute renal failure, some rarely prescribed medications are still under-studied in this regard. In addition, even for those drugs studied in the past, inconsistent findings have been reported. In the present study, by extending a data mining framework from the prior research and equipping that with some standard statistical metric from the medical literature we investigate the general confounding role of the common diabetes medications in developing acute renal failure in a large group of patients with diabetes mellitus (Type II). In addition, we assess the stability of the identified confounding roles by taking into account the potential drug-drug interactions between those diabetes medications with a group of drugs already known to have negative effect on the kidney function. Our results suggest the general dominant confounding role for each of the diabetes medications, but also suggests that these roles are unstable across various prescription combinations due to potential drug-drug interactions, thereby provide an explanation for the inconsistent findings in the literature.

ID AWARE
AB With the wide adoption of service-oriented computing and cloud computing, service-based systems (SBSs), a kind of software systems that can offer certain functionalities by leveraging one or more Web services, become increasingly popular. A challenging issue in SBS development is to find suitable services from a variety of available (semantics different) services. Towards this issue, we propose a new service recommendation approach that can integrate diverse information of SBSs and their component services. In this research, SBSs, services, their respective attributes (e.g. content and categories) and SBS-service composition relations are modeled as a heterogeneous information network (HIN); and several semantic similarities between SBSs are measured on a set of meta-paths in the HIN. Particularly, a word embedding technique is used to learn word vectors from the content of SBSs and services, which contribute to better functional similarities between SBSs. Afterwards, the combinational weights of different similarities are optimized using a Bayesian personalized ranking algorithm. Services are finally recommended based on collaborative filtering. We identify two recommendation scenarios with different SBS requirements. By conducting a series of experiments on a real-world dataset crawled from the ProgrammableWeb, we validate the effectiveness of our approach and find out the optimal combinations of SBS similarities for those two scenarios.

AB The vast amounts of data being collected and analyzed have led to invaluable source of information, which needs to be easily handled by humans. Automatic Text Summarization (ATS) systems enable users to get the gist of information and knowledge in a short time in order to make critical decisions quickly. Deep neural networks have proven their ability to achieve excellent performance in many real-world Natural Language Processing and computer vision applications. However, it still lacks attention in An The key problem of traditional applications is that they involve high dimensional and sparse data, which makes it difficult to capture relevant information. One technique for overcoming these problems is learning features via dimensionality reduction. On the other hand, word embedding is another neural network technique that generates a much more compact word representation than a traditional Bag-of-Words (BOW) approach. In this paper, we are seeking to enhance the quality of ATS by integrating unsupervised deep neural network techniques with word embedding approach. First, we develop a word embedding based text summarization, and we show that Word2Vec representation gives better results than traditional BOW representation. Second, we propose other models by combining word2vec and unsupervised feature learning methods in order to merge information from different sources. We show that unsupervised neural networks models trained on Word2Vec representation give better results than those trained on BOW representation. Third, we also propose three ensemble techniques. The first ensemble combines BOW and word2vec using a majority voting technique. The second ensemble aggregates the information provided by the BOW approach and unsupervised neural networks. The third ensemble aggregates the information provided by Word2Vec and unsupervised neural networks. We show that the ensemble methods improve the quality of ATS, in particular the ensemble based on word2vec approach gives better results. Finally, we perform different experiments to evaluate the performance of the investigated models. We use two kind of datasets that are publically available for evaluating ATS task. Results of statistical studies affirm that word embedding-based models outperform the summarization task compared to those based on BOW approach. In particular, ensemble learning technique with Word2Vec representation surpass all the investigated models. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Tor network hosts a significant amount of hidden services related to suspicious activities. Law Enforcement Agencies need to monitor and to investigate crimes hidden behind the anonymity provided by Tor. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, named ToRank, that ranks hidden services in Tor better than the known algorithms used for the Surface Web. We also thoroughly analyze the content present in Tor, creating a dataset, DUTA-10K, that extends the previous Darknet Usage Text Address (DUTA) dataset. We quantitatively compared ToRank with some of the most popular ranking algorithms, like PageRank, HITS, and Katz. Results showed that our proposal obtains a higher harm to the Tor network robustness than all of them, what indicates its superiority for this problem. The analysis of DUTA-10K reveals that only 20% of the hidden services that can be accessed are related to suspicious activities, and 48% are associated with normal ones. We also discovered that domains related to suspicious activities usually present multiple clones under different addresses, what could be used as an additional feature for identifying them. We consider that our new algorithm, the extended dataset, and the findings obtained from the analysis carried out are helpful for LEAs to fight against crimes that take place in the Tor hidden services.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Heterogeneous information network (HIN) is a kind of large-scale network which contains different types of objects and complex links. It is distinguished from a homogenous network for its heterogeneity of objects represented as nodes and complexity of links, which also makes the object classification more difficult. A meta-path can denote the relationship between nodes in HINs, and the path information can be enriched by extracting jump-paths. Based on this idea, the problem of data sparseness can be alleviated effectively. As multiple meta-paths represent different semantics, we propose an active weight learning method for each type, which aims to maximize the weight of meta-path with strong correlation and lower the weight if the correlation is weak. The feature matrix based on the meta-path is constructed and the Random Forest classifier is trained to implement the node classification in HIN5. The experimental results show that our method achieves better performance in the complex network by using the fewer labeled data. The active learning strategy is effective for identifying objects to label for training. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, since the length, frequency, and period of snoring episodes (SE) differ according to the individual being measured, it is very difficult to develop a general reference point to classify snoring. Therefore, in order to classify different snoring patterns and noise for different individuals, a learning-based snoring classification algorithm is essential. To this end, this study proposes a classification method based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) that can classify SEs and non-snoring episodes (NSEs) by learning the features of an individual's SEs and NSEs, measured in daily life based on the subjects' sleep recordings using smartphone. The method proposed in this study can be largely divided into segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. The performance of this study was evaluated through statistical parameters. Despite the fact that the proposed RNN-based classifiers were trained using a relative small dataset, they exhibited an extremely high accuracy of 98.9%. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Detecting key story elements such as protagonist, opponent, desire, turning points, battle, and victory, etc. is essential for various narrative work applications including content retrieval and content recommendation systems. The task of automatically identifying story elements is challenging because of its complexity and subjectiveness and currently, there are no available algorithms for this task. In this paper, we focus on identifying turning points in a story of a cartoon movie. The proposed methodology extends the novel two-clocks theory, originally validated on scripts of theatre plays, to video stories. The assumption behind the two-clocks theory is that the perception of time is different when some special event happens to a certain agent (e.g., time flows slower for a patient and quicker for a tourist). The story timeline is monitored with two clocks: an event clock, which measures the regular time flow of the story; and a weighted clock, which measures the timing of the story events. We have conducted an experiment on 28 episodes of a cartoon series and achieved promising results: 78.6% precision for turning points identification and 100% precision for key scene detection. The proposed approach is the first step towards development of intelligent systems for automated understanding of stories in narrative works such as cinema movies and even amateur videos uploaded to the Internet.

AB In the literature, a wide variety of methods exist for solving fully fuzzy linear programming (FFLP) problems. However, there is still no method to find the unique optimal fuzzy value of FFLP problems with inequality constraints having unrestricted L-R fuzzy parameters and decision variables. Alternatively, some researchers introduce non-negative fuzzy slack and surplus variables to transform the FFLP problems with inequality constraints into FFLP problems having only equality constraints. Others, replace each fuzzy inequality constraint with a set of crisp linear inequalities. However, these two approaches cannot guarantee solutions with unique optimal fuzzy values and may lead to unfeasible problems. In this paper, based on the total order properties of a lexicographic criterion for ranking L-R fuzzy numbers, a method to find the unique optimal fuzzy value of FFLP problems with equality and inequality constraints having unrestricted L-R fuzzy parameters and decision variables is proposed. By following the steps of the proposed method, the FFLP problem is transformed into an equivalent mixed 0-1 lexicographic non-linear programming (MLNLP) problem. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the proposed method, and the results are compared with those obtained by other alternative methods, showing that the proposed method overcomes the shortcomings and limitations of the existing ones.

AB We describe an expert system to monitor the stability of insurance markets. It consists of two components: an agent-based simulation component and a temporal data mining component. Like other financial markets, insurance markets experience destabilizing cycles and suffer episodic crises. The expert system assists market regulators by monitoring the financial position of individual insurers and of the overall market, and by forecasting cycles and impending insolvencies. The agent-based simulation component runs a forward simulation allowing for interaction among insurers in a competitive market, and between insurers and customers. The temporal data mining component extracts useful information for market regulators from the simulations. A prototype of the system is applied to the automobile insurance market. We show how the system may be used to forecast cycles, investigate stability, and analyze insurers' herding behavior on the market. A practical policy conclusion is that regulators should monitor individual insurers' pricing pattern because aggressive price undercutting creates a "winner's curse", with subsequent losses and market instability.

AB In real applications, noises are often present in the obtained data, which would considerably affect the performance of machine learning models. Although support vector machine (SVM) is a classic and efficient learning model, however, it is sensitive to noises in the training data. In this paper, a novel support vector machine named as reconstructed training-set SVM (RTS-SVM) is proposed to implement classification for high-noise data, where the roulette cooperative coevolution algorithm (R-CC) is used to optimize the parameters of RTS-SVM. The proposed SVM model is applicable to make the classification of high-noise data by tackling with the sensitive effect of the "soft margin" of SVM on the original training set. By means of the hierarchical relations existing in feature sets, hierarchical grouping (HG) algorithm is applied to construct feature subsets, based on which R-CC coordinates the parameters of RTS-SVM to achieve the optimization of the whole model. The application of the proposed scheme in the classification of financial time series is mainly discussed. Besides, the proposed model is also verified by using synthetic data with high noises and daily life data sets. Examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Technology enhanced learning (TEL) represents an expert and intelligent paradigm in which technological affordances are used to facilitate learners' acquisition of domain knowledge (DK), where Ubiquitous-Learning (u-learning) is a TEL instance that recreates situated and immersive settings. However in such settings, learners are stressed by diverse, heterogeneous, and simultaneous stimuli that challenge their cognitive skills, increase the cognitive load, trigger emotional reactions, and bias conduct. Thus this research proposes a smart Sequencing approach that enables TEL systems to lead students to regulate their learning process. The essence of the proposal is a holistic self-regulated learning (SRL) model that encourage students to develop higher-order thinking through the practice of metacognitive skills, motivational factors, and behavioral affairs to become aware of their own learning endeavors. The approach was applied as part of the sequencing module of a u-Learning system, where students follow its suggested cognitive strategies to assist them during the programming of control equipment. Results show that, although experimental subjects had to deal with higher cognitive load, they are expected to reach higher learning achievements than their control peers. The experience reveals how TEL systems are enabled to foster learners to handle their own apprenticeship processes. As a consequence, the smart sequencing functionality of TEL is cognitively enhanced to facilitate students the simultaneal acquisition DK and development of higher-order thinking.

AB The process of determining relevant landmarks within a certain region is a challenging task, mainly due to its subjective nature. Many of the current lines of work include the use of density-based clustering algorithms as the base tool for such a task, as they permit the generation of clusters of different shapes and sizes. However, there are still important challenges, such as the variability in scale and density. In this paper, we present two novel density-based clustering algorithms that can be applied to solve this: K-DBSCAN, a clustering algorithm based on Gaussian Kernels used to detect individual inhabited cores within regions; and V-DBSCAN, a hierarchical algorithm suitable for sample spaces with variable density, which is used to attempt the discovery of relevant landmarks in cities or regions. The obtained results are outstanding, since the system properly identifies most of the main touristic attractions within a certain region under analysis. A comparison with respect to the state-of-the-art show that the presented method clearly outperforms the current methods devoted to solve this problem. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Recently, heterogeneous network representation learning has attracted a lot of attentions due to its potential applications. Our works in this paper are concentrated on how to leverage the output of network representation learning by combining with the topic similarity between nodes in content-based heterogeneous information network (C-HIN). These unique challenges come from the shortage of topic similarity evaluation between text-based nodes which limit the accuracy of the similarity search as well other network mining tasks. Moreover, the massive sizes of current real-world network also raises challenges for traditional standalone-based heterogeneous network analysis models. Different from previous network representation learning models, such as: Node2Vec or Metapath2Vec, our proposed W-MethPath2Vec model uses the topic-driven meta-path-based random walk mechanism for generating heterogeneous neighborhood of nodes as the learning features. Then, these learning nodes' features are used to train the learning model which is used for solving various heterogeneous network mining tasks such as: node similarity search, clustering, classification, link prediction, etc. The W-MethPath2Vec model enables the simultaneous modeling of structural and topic correlations between nodes in heterogeneous networks. Moreover, the W-MethPath2Vec model is implemented in the Apache Spark-based distributed framework which enables the capability of handling large-scaled networks. We tested our W-MethPath2Vec model with the previous state-of-the-art approaches in the real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB For multi-objective problems, most corresponding methods will terminate when the non-dominated set (Pareto set) is acquired, while some redundant systems may exist in it. The same situation may appear in the weapon system portfolio selection as it always tends to be a multi-objective problem. The paper employs a baseline-based method to decide whether to select a redundant system. First, the problem is analyzed in depth to demonstrate the connotation of baseline and related concepts are defined. Then, based on the definition of the redundancy system, baseline system, and baseline value, the weapon system portfolio selection approach with regard to a baseline value is proposed. Starting from the two core parts of the approach, selection strategy analysis, and weapon systems ranking, the strategy analysis of weapon system selection under a single objective and multiple objectives were performed. Subsequently, the interval number theory was employed to extend the VIKOR method to the E-VIKOR method, with a linear programming model as the weighting method under uncertainties to rank the candidate weapon systems. Finally, a case with three different ranking results of candidate weapon systems are studied under different weighting schemes. Based on the ranking results, baseline value, and selection strategy, the weapon system portfolio refining was developed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Feature engineering forms an important component of machine learning and pattern recognition. It is a fundamental process for off-line writer identification of handwritten documents, which continues to be an interesting subject of research in various forensic and authentication areas. In this work, we propose an efficient, yet computationally and conceptually simple framework for off-line text independent writer identification using local textural features in characterizing the writing style of each writer. These include Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Local Ternary Patterns (LIP), and Local Phase Quantization (LPQ). Our approach focuses on exploiting the writing images at small observation regions where a set of connected component sub-images are cropped and extracted from each handwriting sample (document or set of word text line images). These connected components are seen as texture images where each one of them is subjected to feature extraction using LBP, LPQ or LTP. Then, a histogram sequence concatenation is applied to the feature image after dimensionality reduction followed by image subdivision into a number of non-overlapping regions. For classification, the 1-NN (Nearest Neighbor) classifier is used to identify the writer of the questioned samples based on the dissimilarity of feature vectors computed from all components in the writing. Experiments on IFN/ENIT (411 writers/Arabic), AHTID/MW (53 writers/Arabic), CVL (309 writers/English), and IAM (657 writers/English) databases demonstrate that our proposed system outperforms old and recent state-of-the-art writer identification systems on Arabic script, and demonstrates a competitive performance on English ones.

AB Motivation and Objectives: Smartphones are emerging as personal fitness assistants, collecting data through in-built or external sensors. The next frontier for these devices is to use advanced sensors and machine learning algorithms to offer more personalized and advanced medical assessments. Along these lines, the objective of this paper is to develop a multi-label classification model to detect heart complications through electrocardiograms (EKGs) collected by an FDA-approved single-lead EKG sensor attached to a smartphone. The EKG sensor produces a standard EKG chart, but for such a sensor to be useful to a consumer, an interpretation of the graph is necessary.
   Materials and Method: We adapt a machine-learning approach to detect multiple heart conditions simultaneously from the generated EKG graph. Three different multi-label machine learning models (binary relevance, label powerset and multi-perceptron neural network) were built and compared to categorize five different heart states: Normal, Atrial Fibrillation, Atrioventricular Block, Sinus Bradycardia and Sinus Tachycardia. The binary relevance model was selected based on the accuracy.
   Results and Implications: The model generated rules inductively from the data to interpret nine out of every ten heart conditions correctly. Our model is being adapted for commercial use by a company (as a part of their App) that markets the EKG sensor for smartphones. Our model is usable in a cardiovascular disease alert expert system that will potentially allow users to monitor their heart health continuously and prevent a serious illness by providing this information in the early stages.

AB The element concentration in lettuces grouped in 5 categories (baby variety, cultivated in agricultural soils with low or high percentages of spent coffee grounds-SCG, without SCG and with NPK) were measured. Lettuces cultivated in agricultural soils amended with SCG had significantly higher levels of several essential (V, Fe, Co, V, and probably Mn and Zn) and toxic elements (Al and probably As), without reaching their toxicological limits. Additionally, blocking of N uptake and therefore plant biomass, and probably Cd absorption from agricultural soil was observed. Organic farming with SCG ameliorates element concentrations in lettuces vs. NPK fertilization. The linear correlations among element uptake and the amendment of SCG could be related with their chelation by some SCG components, such as melanoidins and with the decrease in the soil pH. In conclusion, the addition of SCG produces lettuces with higher element content.

AB Phenolic compounds are a large class of plant secondary metabolites with various health-promoting effects, and are known for their structural diversity. Therefore, high efficiency characterization of phenolic profiles is of key importance in identifying their potential bioactivity. In the present study, Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) Molecular Networking was applied to trace the phenolic compounds in plants, which allowed the characterization of 9 procyanidins and 11 flavonoid glycosides (di-, tri-, or tetra-saccharides of kaempferol, quercetin, isorhamnetin and myricetin) in litchi pulp extracts. Six compounds were reported for the first time in litchi pulp. In addition, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside-(1 -> 2)-O-rhamnoside, the most abundant flavonoid glycoside in litchi pulp, was proved to have considerable a-glucosidase inhibitory activity, illustrating the anti-diabetic potential of phenolic-rich litchi pulp extracts.

AB The aim of the present work was to develop an amperometric biosensor for tyramine (Tyr) measurement in food and beverages. The biosensor architecture is based on tyrosinase (Tyrase) immobilization on glassy carbon electrode modified by a nanocomposite consisting of gold nanoparticles (AuNP) synthesized by a green method and poly(8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulphonic acid) modified glassy carbon electrode. Under optimized experimental conditions for fixed potential amperometric detection, the biosensor exhibited a linear response to tyramine in the range 10-120 mu M and the limit of detection was estimated to be 0.71 mu M. The novel platform showed good selectivity, long-term stability, and reproducibility. The strong interaction between tyrosinase and the nanocomposite was revealed by the high value of the Michaelis-Menten constant (79.3 mu M). The fabricated biosensor was successfully applied to the determination of Tyr in dairy products and fermented drinks with good recoveries, which makes it a promising biosensor for quantification of tyramine.

AB Minor lipids in cereals (such as phytosterols and alkylresorcinols) can be important for human nutrition and/or be used as biomarkers for cereal intake. However, the analysis of cereal lipids is very challenging due to the complex lipidome comprising several hundred individual compounds present over a wide range of concentrations.
   Here we present a method for the profiling of cereal lipids using high temperature gas chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (GC/Q-TOF MS). The method was used to investigate the lipid profiles of 77 samples of bread wheat, spelt, einkorn, emmer, barley, rye and oats.
   Distinct differences in the patterns of alkylresorcinols, free and conjugated sterols and tocopherols between the cereals could be observed. Furthermore, traces of tocomonoenols and diunsaturated and methyl-alkylresorcinols (not previously reported in cereals) could be detected. Finally, the lipid patterns in the cereals could be used to separate the cereals by Principal Component Analysis.

AB Current work presents a modified QuEChERS method for the determination of 207 pesticide residues in honey by LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS. Acetate buffered acetonitrile extraction with Z-Sep + and PSA dispersive-SPE cleanup were used for sample preparation. Optimised conditions allows determination of neonicotinoids as well as other insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, acaricides, growth regulators and veterinary drugs in honey samples. Validated method enable sensitive analysis at least at concentrations from 0.001, 0.005 or 0.01 mg/kg for 45%, 41% and 14% of pesticides, respectively. Method was utilised for the analysis of 155 honey samples from Poland during 2015-2017. Residues of 21 pesticides were determined in honey. Cyano-substituted neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, thiacloprid) were quantified in 77% of samples and were the most frequently detected pesticides. Concentrations of acetamiprid was from 0.001 to 0.13 mg/kg whilst thiacloprid from 0.001 to 0.2 mg/kg. Fungicides were determined in 50% and amitraz metabolites in 35% of honey samples.

AB High cost and enzyme deactivation in purification process are the two main obstacles for the use of enzyme as green catalyst. The objective of this work was to overcome these limitations by developing a cost-effective aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) for efficient purification of enzymes with remarkable separation efficiency and high retention of enzyme activity. The ATPS was formed by thermo-responsive block copolymer PEG113-bPNIPAM149 and salt as phase-forming components combining economy, recovery and sustainability. This strategy fabricated block copolymer with specified molecular weight and low LCST, which not only achieved better phase splitting but also ensured easy recycling for block copolymer. The developed ATPS demonstrated excellent extraction and biocompatibility for bromelain in real sample with 94.87% separation efficiency and 77.06% activity, which were remarkably higher than those obtained in EOPOEO-based ATPS. The recycling of copolymer was introduced to minimize cost, with recovery efficiency of 90% in the five cycles.

AB The adsorption capacity of principal phenolic compounds onto cell walls from three apple varieties was investigated. Isothermal adsorption modelled with Langmuir, Freundlich and Redlich-Peterson equations were carried out over a range of concentrations from 0.5 to 30 mM before and after cell walls were subjected to boiling, oven-drying or freeze-drying. The isotherm data were best fitted by the Langmuir model in all cases. Polyphenols selectively adsorbed onto cell walls with maximum binding capacities ranging from 140 to 580 mu g/mg cell walls depending on surface charge. Increased pectin in apple cell walls caused a 129%-311% decrease in the adsorption of negatively charged polyphenols, presumably due to electrostatic repulsive forces. Boiling had limited effect on cell wall polysaccharides and polyphenol-cell wall interactions. However, more than twofold reduction in binding capacities of polyphenols was induced after drying by altering the structural (i.e. binding sites) and compositional (i.e. pectin degradation) characteristics of cell walls.

AB The effect of high pressure homogenization (HPH) on physical and bioactive properties of rosehip nectar was investigated. Rosehip nectar has a sedimentation problem while waiting on the market shelf during the sale, for solving this problem, nectars were passed 1, 2 and 3 times through 75, 100 and 125 MPa pressures. Mean particle size decreased as pressure and pass number increased (p < 0.05), whereas zeta potential did not change (p > 0.05). Microstructural images revealed that HPH treatment disrupted the cells and caused to release of cell materials to serum. HPH treatment increased the.E values (from 2.48 to 6.03). HPH treated samples showed no sedimentation during storage for 15 days. All samples showed shear thinning behavior and were characterized as weak gel network (G' > G ''). Total phenolic content and ascorbic acid results were decreased by HPH treatments due to increasing outlet temperatures of product, however, antioxidant capacity of nectars increased after treatment due to increasing total carotenoid content. This study indicated that HPH treatment could solve the sedimentation problem during shelf life with minimally affecting bioactive and physical properties of rosehip nectar.

AB Honey, as a commercial product, is a target of adulteration through inappropriate production practices and deliberate mislabelling of botanical origin. Floral nectar protein could be a good marker for determining the source flowers of honey, especially monofloral honeys. Here, nectar and monofloral honey from Eriobotrya japonica Lindl. (loquat) were systematically compared, especially regarding proteomic and enzymatic activity. Using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, only bee-originated proteins were detected in loquat honey. Xylosidase, thaumatin, and two kinds of chitinases were detected in loquat floral nectar, and their activity in loquat nectar and honey were quantified. Following gel electrophoresis, loquat honey had similar chitinase activity profiles to loquat nectar, but both were clearly distinguishable from Camellia sinensis nectar and Brassica napus honey. To our knowledge, this is the first examination of nectar-origin enzyme activity in honey. Zymography of chitinases is a potential marker for determining or authenticating the botanical origin of honeys.

AB Paracentrotus lividus gonads are gastronomic delicacies widely appreciated in Europe. Two commercially exploited populations of sea urchins were characterized, for the first time, in terms of gonad quality (market-related traits such as colour, texture and nutritional value) and safety (contaminants levels) to define the best season for harvesting this valuable resource. Spawning occurred between spring-summer, yet gonad index peaked only in one population during winter. In both populations, the strongest yellow colouration and highest gonad firmness, protein, lipid, polyunsaturated fatty acids and carotenoid contents as well as the lowest contents of mineral were registered in fall. Inorganic and organic contaminants levels were, in general, similar among sites and seasons, being found at trace levels in seawater and gonads, with low risk for consumers. For these populations, high-quality gonads can be harvested during fall, despite being safe for human consumption all year round.

AB The use of infrared spectroscopy for the screening of 229 unprocessed durum wheat samples naturally contaminated with OTA has been investigated. Samples were analysed by both Fourier Transform near-and midinfrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR, FT-MIR). Partial-Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and Principal Component-Linear Discriminant Analysis (PC-LDA) classification models were used to differentiate highly contaminated durum wheat samples from low contaminated ones and the performances of the resulting models were compared. The overall discrimination rates were higher than 94% for both FT-NIR and FT-MIR range by using a cut-off limit set at 2 mu g/kg OTA, independently from the classification model used thus confirming the reliability of the two statistical approaches used. False compliant rates of 6% were obtained for both spectral ranges and both classification models.
   These findings indicate that FT-NIR, as well as FT-MIR analysis, might be a promising, inexpensive and easyto- use screening tool to rapidly discriminate unprocessed wheat samples for OTA content.

AB A one-step method to immobilize xylanase onto cellulosic material by fusion of expansin from Bacillus subtilis to xylanase LC9 without the requirement of prior purification of enzyme has been developed. Fusion enzyme EXLX-R2-XYN was specifically adsorbed onto corncob residue with high loading capacity due to bio-affinity adsorption of expansin onto cellulose. The immobilization yield was close to 100%, with a recovered activity of 82.4%. The immobilized EXLX-R2-XYN retained 45.3% of its activity after incubation at 70 degrees C for 3 h, whereas only 16.3% of the activity was left in free form under the same conditions. The conversion yield of XOS by using immobilized EXLX-R2-XYN reached up to 515 mg/g xylan from 2% corncob extracted xylan, which was higher than that of the free enzyme. The hydrolysis products were mainly xylobiose (57.5%) and xylotriose (38.4%), without undesirable xylose production. After five cycles of hydrolysis, more than 70% of conversion was obtained.

AB Kefir, a probiotic beverage prepared from fermented milk, has been associated with antihypertensive activity. However, the bioactive molecules responsible for this activity still remain unclear. Therefore, in this study we aim to evaluate the mechanisms of the antihypertensive effects of Kefir in the two-kidney one-clip hypertension model, and to bioprospect for bioactive peptides identified by proteomic methodologies. Treatment with Kefir was performed via gavage, and resulted in a 37 mmHg reduction in systolic arterial pressure and 19% inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity. For the proteopeptidomic study, the protein extract of Kefir beverage and non-fermented bovine milk were analysed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and their tryptic digestion products sequenced via Shotgun proteomics (Q-Exactive mass spectrometer). A list of 35 peptides with potential hypertensive activity due to ACE inhibition were identified. These results demonstrate the benefits of Kefir products, and may guide the design of new antihypertensive drugs.

AB This work has proposed the application of optimized dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) in order to extract acrylamide from brewed coffee samples for its subsequent determination by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). DLLME achieved superior results employing 300 mu L of brewed coffee, 100 mu L of dichloromethane, 400 mu L of acetonitrile and without sodium chloride addition. Quantitative analyses were carried out by the standard addition method, and the limits of detection and quantification were 0.9 and 3.0 mu g L-1, respectively. Recoveries ranged from 97 to 106%, and the intra-and inter-assay precisions ranged from 6 to 9%. The proposed analytical method was applied to seventeen brewed coffee samples prepared in a filter coffee maker, and acrylamide amounts varied from 10.5 to 28.5 mu g L-1. Therefore, the suggested DLLME-UPLC-MS/MS method is promising for routine analysis in order to guarantee the quality control of acrylamide in brewed coffee.

AB Glucosinolates (GLS) have been reported to have significant anti-oxidative, antimicrobial, and anti-cancer activities. The current study was aimed to develop an analytical method for glucosinolate quantitation in eight Brassica species from Gwangju, Republic of Korea. For this purpose the UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS technique was used and validated for optimal extraction conditions, detection and quantitation limits, linearity, precision, and accuracy. According to the results of GLS profiling, the total GLS concentration decreased in the order of cabbage > broccoli > cauliflower > mustard > kimchi cabbage > young radish similar to kale. All Brassica species contained glucoerucin (GER) and glucobrassicin (GBR) as major GLS with the high levels in cabbage (5.913 mu M/g) and broccoli (1.723 mu M/g), respectively. The contents of minor GLS were species-dependent, and could therefore be used for Brassica species classification.

AB The aim of this study was to provide new approach in creating gluten-containing and gluten-free breads without additives by combining thermal and hydrothermal pretreatments of flours (rye, oat, sorghum and millet).
   The applied methodology included determinations of chemical composition of flours and breads, water absorption index, empirical and fundamental rheological measurements, and scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, colour, textural and sensory evaluations of breads.
   Novel rye, oat, sorghum and millet breads based on the blend of heat treated and extruded corresponding flours in ratio 70: 30 were produced by conventional breadmaking process. All breads were characterized by increased fibre content and had appearance similar to common wheat bread. Gluten-free breads were harder, less elastic with more granular structure due to higher degree of starch crystallinity. Mixolab curves indicated on many possible ways for further breads optimisation.

AB Ochratoxin A (OTA) poses a serious threat to the health of human beings and animals. In this paper, a simple and sensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) aptasensor was constructed to detect OTA based on electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET) and a nicking endonuclease-powered DNA walking machine. Originally, the signal of cadmium sulfide semiconductor quantum dots (CdS QDs) was quenched efficiently by Cy5. After the addition of OTA, the walker autonomously hybridized with Cy5-labeled DNA and released plenty of Cy5-DNA from the electrode surface with the help of a nicking endonuclease. As a result, the signal of CdS QDs recovered efficiently. As an artificial and popular signal amplification technique, the DNA walking machine greatly improved the sensitivity. Under optimal conditions, the aptasensor not only detected OTA in a linear range from 0.05 nM to 5 nM with a detection limit of 0.012 nM (S/N= 3), but also showed an excellent selectivity for OTA over other mycotoxins.

AB The statistical method of random uncertainties has been adopted for the uncertainty calculation of chemical measurements, since it is a good estimator of the overall uncertainty. Type B (inherited) uncertainties are usually insignificant when compared to type A (experimental) uncertainties. In quantitative measures, the mean is the most probable value of the measurand and the standard deviation of the mean is the best estimate of its standard uncertainty. Measurement uncertainty of qualitative measures may be estimated by the probability of taking right or wrong decisions. Thus, performance data of analytical methods are the main source of uncertainties. However, uncertainties obtained from limited observations should be used with caution to represent the overall uncertainty. This study demonstrated the influence of random uncertainties on the results of experimental approaches to estimate the uncertainty in chemical assays. The different profiles of uncertainty were demonstrated depending on the analytical technique and food composition.

AB Toona sinensis (A. Juss.) M. Roem. (TS) possesses a unique and pleasant flavor and is consumed as a popular seasonal vegetable in certain parts of eastern and southeastern Asia. The potent odorants in raw and cooked TS were identified by combined sensory and instrumental analysis techniques, including sensory descriptive aroma profiling and two complimentary volatile isolation methods combined with gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) techniques. Highly volatile odorants were determined by static headspace dilution analysis (SHDA)-GCO, while those of intermediate-and semi-volatility were determined by solvent-assisted flavor evaporationaroma extract dilution analysis (SAFE-AEDA). Among the numerous odorants identified by SHDA and SAFEAEDA, (E, E)-bis-(1-propenyl) disulfide was found to be predominant in both raw and cooked TS. In agreement with results of sensory descriptive analysis, hexanal, (Z)-3-hexenal, (E)-2-hexenal and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol contributed green, grassy and leafy aroma notes; while hydrogen sulfide, methyl thiirane, (E, E)-bis-(1-propenyl) disulfide and (E, Z)-bis-(1-propenyl) disulfide contributed pungent, sulfurous and alliaceous notes in TS.

AB Germinated brown rice (GBR) flours were prepared by hammer milling and jet milling. The effect of the milling on the physicochemical and pasting properties of the resultant flours were investigated. The jet milling of GBR resulted in flour with different particle sizes, which were air-classified into coarse and fine size fractions. As the particle size decreased, the amount of damaged starch increased. The WAI, WSI, and oil absorption of the jetmilled GBR flour was slightly lower than that of the hammer-milled flour. Increased alpha- and beta-amylase activities were observed in the coarse fraction of the jet-milled GBR flour compared with the hammer-milled and jet-milled fine fractions. The RVA viscosity profiles of the fine fraction of the jet-milled GBR flour were significantly higher than those of the hammer-milled or the coarse fraction of the jet-milled GBR flour. Compared with the hammermilled flour, jet milling increased in vitro starch hydrolysis.

ID RISK-FACTORS
AB Despite increasing global measles vaccination coverage, progress toward measles elimination has slowed in recent years. In China, children receive a measles-containing vaccine (MCV) at 8 months, 18-24 months, and some urban areas offer a third dose at age 4-6 years. However, substantial measles cases in Tianjin, China, occur among individuals who have received multiple MCV doses. This study describes the vaccination history of measles cases 8 months - 19 years old. Data came from measles cases in Tianjin's reportable disease surveillance system (2009-2013), and from a case control study (2011-2015). Twenty-nine percent of those in the surveillance dataset and 54.4% of those in the case series received at least one dose of MCV. The minimum and median time-to-diagnosis since vaccination revealed an increase in time since vaccination for incremental doses. Considerable measles cases in Tianjin occur in vaccinated children, and further research is needed to understand the reasons for vaccine failure. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   DISCLOSURE
AB Objectives: The effectiveness of vaccines is known to be altered by a range of psychological factors. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effects of psychological interventions on the ability of vaccines to protect against disease, as measured by antibody responses.
   Methods: Electronic databases (EMBASE, Medline, PsychINFO, CINAHL) were searched from their inception to 6th February 2018.
   Results: The search yielded 9 eligible trials conducted with 1603 participants and four broad categories of intervention: meditation/mindfulness (n = 3), massage (n = 3), expressive writing (n = 2) and cognitive behavioural stress management (n = 1). Some evidence of benefit on the antibody response to vaccination was observed in 6/9 of all trials and in 4/7 of randomised controlled trials. However, effects on antibody levels were often mixed, with only 3 of 6 trials showing benefit demonstrating an improvement in all antibody outcomes and at all time points assessed. Trials demonstrating benefit also provided direct or indirect evidence of adequate adherence with the intervention; and in 50% of these trials, there was also evidence that the intervention was effective in changing the mediating psychological constructs targeted by the intervention.
   Conclusions: This literature is characterised by considerable heterogeneity in terms of intervention type, vaccine type, age of participants and the temporal relationship between vaccination and intervention. We conclude that there is early evidence to suggest that psychological interventions may enhance the antibody response to vaccination. However, the effects are inconsistent, with the greatest likelihood of benefit seen in trials evidencing adequate adherence with the intervention. Future work would benefit from rigorous intervention development that focuses on achieving adequate adherence and large well-controlled randomised trials with a focus on an agreed set of outcomes.

AB Immunizing pregnant women is a promising strategy to reduce infectious disease-related morbidity and mortality in pregnant women and their infants. Important pre-requisites for the successful introduction of new vaccines for immunization in pregnancy include political commitment and adequate financial resources: trained, committed and sufficient numbers of healthcare workers to deliver the vaccines; close integration of immunization programs with antenatal care and Maternal and Child Health services; adequate access to antenatal care by pregnant women in the country (especially in low and middle-income countries (LMIC)); and a high proportion of births occurring in health facilities (to ensure maternal and neonatal follow-up can be done). The framework needed to advance a vaccine program from product licensure to successful country-level implementation includes establishing and organizing evidence for anticipated vaccine program impact, developing supportive policies, and translating policies into local action. International and national coordination efforts, proactive planning from conception to implementation of the programs (including country-level policy making, planning, and implementation, regulatory guidance, pharmacovigilance) and country-specific and cultural factors must be taken into account during the vaccines introduction.

AB Introduction: The 2009 influenza pandemic highlighted challenges for vaccine post-marketing monitoring in Europe, particularly the need to have appropriate infrastructures to strengthen public-private collaborations (PPCs) with suitable processes to improve stakeholder interactions and collection and analysis of safety and effectiveness data. The ADVANCE consortium comprises public and private stakeholders who have worked together to build and test new system components for vaccine post-marketing projects, one component being a governance framework for efficient, transparent and trustworthy PPCs.
   Methods: Based on the results of a landscape analysis and screening of formalised existing governance structures, we identified the elements of a governance framework and developed recommendations to support stakeholders willing and able to implement collaborative projects. These proposals and their implementation were discussed by 70 experts during a workshop to gain from their experience.
   Results: We identified core governance principles and defined five fundamental functions (decision-making, scientific advice, quality control and audit, implementation and management, and financial administration) that can be attributed to individual partner organisations or to a committee with representatives from more than one partner organisation. We propose a generic governance model with options for its adaptation to specific contexts and projects. The advantages and disadvantages of PPCs were also examined. Stakeholders' concerns (e.g. scientific integrity and public trust) were addressed through recommendations about transparent decision-making rules and conflict of interest management.
   Conclusions: No one-size-fits-all solution for PPC governance exists but our recommendations could be used to set-up a tailored-made and fully transparent governance structure supporting collaborative projects in the European vaccine post-marketing environment. To allow the rapid establishment of robust projects, the next steps will involve this guidance being used by real-world collaborations to assess what works and what does not work and what added-value can be obtained from these collaborations.

TI New vaccine introductions in Africa before and during the decade of

ID IMMUNIZATION
AB Vaccines are excellent investments with far-reaching rewards beyond individual and population health, but their introduction into national programs has been historically slow in Africa. We provide an overview of the introduction of new and underutilized vaccines in countries of the WHO African Region by 2017, using data from the WHO-UNICEF Joint Reporting Form. By 2017, all 47 countries had introduced vaccines containing hepatitis B (compared to 11% in 2000 and 98% in 2010) and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) (compared to 4% in 2000 and 91% in 2010). The proportion of countries that had introduced other vaccines by 2017 was 83% for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) from 7% in 2010, 72% for rotavirus vaccine from 2% in 2010, 55% for the second dose of a measles-containing vaccine (MCV2) (compared to 11% in 2000 and 17% in 2010), and 45% for rubella-containing vaccines (RCV) (compared to 4% in 2000 and 7% in 2010). From 2000 to 2010, there was no significant difference between countries eligible (N = 36) and those not eligible (N = 10) for Gavi support in the introduction of hepatitis B and PCV. However, Gavi eligible countries were more likely to introduce Hib and non-Gavi eligible countries were more likely to introduce MCV2 and RCV. From 2010 to 2017, the only significant differences that remained between the two groups of countries were with mumps, inactivated polio and seasonal influenza vaccines; which non-Gavi eligible countries were more likely to have introduced. There has been significant progress in the introduction of new childhood vaccines in Africa, mostly driven by Gavi support. As many countries are expected to transition out of Gavi support soon, there is need for countries in the region to identify predictable, reliable and sustainable immunization funding mechanisms. This requires commitments and actions that go beyond the purchase of vaccines. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objectives: We evaluate safety of routine vaccination among adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in five healthcare organizations in the United States.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of HIV-infected adults who received inactivated influenza vaccines, hepatitis B vaccines, pneumococcal vaccines, or tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccines between 2002 and 2013. We conducted self-controlled case series analysis to estimate the relative risk (RR) for 11 pre-specified adverse events (AEs) requiring medical attention.
   Results: Among 20,417 HIV-infected adults (90.2% male), a total of 137,674 vaccine doses were administered. Based on ICD-9 codes, we detected an increased risk of cellulitis and infection (RR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.03-1.35) among all patients, and an increased risk of stroke/cerebrovascular diseases among patients with an HIV viral load >10,000 copies/ml (adjusted RR: 3.94, 95% CI: 1.32-11.72). Further analyses on chart confirmed cases of stroke/cerebrovascular diseases indicated no statistically significant increased risk (adjusted RR: 1.72, 95% CI: 0.41-7.24). There was no evidence of increased risk for other AEs following routine vaccination in HIV-infected adults.
   Conclusions: Routinely administered vaccines are generally safe for HIV-infected adults. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Influenza infection is associated with a significant health burden in children, especially in developing countries. The influenza vaccine is an important preventive strategy for flu illness. Aim of this study to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) related to influenza illness and vaccination in children in the Jordanian population and to study the effect of awareness campaigns on changing the attitudes of parents toward vaccinating their children against influenza.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among families visiting shopping malls and parks in November 2016. A questionnaire was administered via in-person interviews. Answers to KAP questions regarding influenza illness and vaccination were summed, with a total KAP score of 30. Facts about influenza illness and vaccination were explained to parents and provided in printed pamphlets.
   Results: There were 1241 respondents. 10.9% of participants had vaccinated their children during the last season 2015/2016. The mean KAP score (standard deviation) was 16.21 (4.61). People living in urban areas, with high monthly income >600 JD and healthcare workers had higher KAP scores than their counterparts. Compared to other sources of information about the influenza vaccine, health resources correlated most with vaccinating children. Awareness and educational pamphlets changed attitudes positively in 29% of parents who refused the influenza vaccine for their children.
   Conclusions: Awareness about influenza illness and vaccination is insufficient, and the coverage rate of influenza vaccination in children is low in the Jordanian population. Implementing public health policies is necessary to spread knowledge about influenza illness and vaccination and to promote the practice of receiving the influenza vaccine in children. Educational campaigns are helpful in changing the attitudes of parents toward vaccinating their children against the flu. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: In Italy, free HPV vaccination has been offered to 12 years-old girls since 2007, while for males only since 2015. The aims of our study were: to measure HPV vaccination coverage among young women; to assess willingness to receive HPV vaccination among unvaccinated males and females; to evaluate the association of coverage and attitudes with knowledge regarding HPV and with sexual behavior.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in an Italian region among 18-30 year-old students attending medical and healthcare professions schools. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire exploring knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to HPV infections, sexually transmitted diseases and their prevention. Information on vaccination status was also verified for each student through the immunization records provided by the participants during the occupational medical visit.
   Results: 517 students were enrolled, with a 97% response rate. Of female participants, 40.5% had received at least one dose of HPV vaccine, while among unvaccinated participants, 60.5% stated their willingness to be vaccinated. A negative attitude towards HPV vaccination was associated with an older age, whereas a correct knowledge that both sexes are at risk of HPV infection, and the knowledge that vaccine protects against cervical cancer were confirmed to be associated to a willingness to receive HPV vaccination.
   Conclusions: Our results showed low HPV vaccination coverage among young women and high reported willingness to receive vaccination among both sexes. More active education on the link between HPV and all related cancers could be beneficial to help prevent significant burden of the HPV-related diseases. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Novel live-attenuated V4020 vaccine was prepared for Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), an alphavirus from the Togaviridae family. The genome of V4020 virus was rearranged, with the capsid gene expressed using a duplicate subgenomic promoter downstream from the glycoprotein genes. V4020 also included both attenuating mutations from the TC83 VEEV vaccine secured by mutagenesis to prevent reversion mutations. The full-length infectious RNA of V4020 vaccine virus was expressed from pMG4020 plasmid downstream from the CMV promoter and launched replication of live-attenuated V4020 in vitro or in vivo. BALB/c mice vaccinated with a single dose of V4020 virus or with pMG4020 plasmid had no adverse reactions to vaccinations and developed high titers of neutralizing antibodies. After challenge with the wild type VEEV, vaccinated mice survived with no morbidity, while all unvaccinated controls succumbed to lethal infection. Intracranial injections in mice showed attenuated replication of V4020 vaccine virus as compared to the TC83. We conclude that V4020 vaccine has safety advantage over TC83, while provides equivalent protection in a mouse VEEV challenge model. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: We evaluated safety and immunogenicity of the first mRNA vaccines against potentially pandemic avian H1ON8 and H7N9 influenza viruses.
   Methods: Two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 1 clinical trials enrolled participants between December 2015 and August 2017 at single centers in Germany (H1ON8) and USA (H7N9). Healthy adults (ages 18-64 years for H1ON8 study; 18-49 years for H7N9 study) participated. Participants received vaccine or placebo in a 2-dose vaccination series 3 weeks apart. H1ON8 intramuscular (IM) dose levels of 25, 50, 75, 100, and 400 a and intradermal dose levels of 25 and 50 mu g were evaluated. H7N9 IM 10-, 25-, and 50-pg dose levels were evaluated; 2-dose series 6 months apart was also evaluated. Primary endpoints were safety (adverse events) and tolerability. Secondary immunogenicity outcomes included humoral (hemagglutination inhibition [HAI], microneutralization [MN] assays) and cell-mediated responses (ELISPOT assay).
   Results: H10N8 and H7N9 mRNA IM vaccines demonstrated favorable safety and reactogenicity profiles. No vaccine-related serious adverse event was reported. For H1ON8 (N = 201), 100-mu g IM dose induced HAI titers >= 1:40 in 100% and MN titers >= 1:20 in 87.0% of participants. The 25-mu g intradermal dose induced HAI titers >= 1:40 in 64.7% of participants compared to 34.5% of participants receiving the IM dose. For H7N9 (N = 156), IM doses of 10, 25, and 50 mu g achieved HAI titers >= 1:40 in 36.0%, 96.3%, and 89.7% of participants, respectively. MN titers >= 1:20 were achieved by 100% in the 10- and 25-mu g groups and 96.6% in the 50-mu g group. Seroconversion rates were 78.3% (HAI) and 87.0% (MN) for H1ON8 (100 mu g IM) and 96.3% (HAI) and 100% (MN) in H7N9 (50 mu g). Significant cell-mediated responses were not detected in either study.
   Conclusions: The first mRNA vaccines against H1ON8 and H7N9 influenza viruses were well tolerated and elicited robust humoral immune responses. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Accumulating literature revealed that human mucosa was likely one of the important routes for EBOV attachment and further infection. Therefore inducing effective mucosal immune responses play key role in preventing the virus infection. Vaccinia virus Tiantan strain (VV) was a remarkably attenuated poxvirus, which has been broadly exploited as a multifunctional vector during the development of genetically recombinant vaccine and cancer therapeutic agent. In this study, we generated a recombinant VV harboring EBOV gp (VV-(Egp)) that was used to immunize mice, followed by assessing immune responses, particularly the mucosal immune responses to EBOV GP. A stable and further attenuated VV-(Egp) in which the VV ha gene was replaced with the EBOV gp, was generated. In BALB/c mouse model, intranasal immunization with VV-(Egp) elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses, including high level of neutralizing serum IgG and IgA against EBOV, and a large amount of GP-specific IFN-gamma secreting lymphocytes. More importantly, EBOV GP-specific neutralizing secreted IgA (sIgA) in nasal wash and both sIgA and IgG in vaginal wash were induced. In summary, immunization with a safe and stable recombinant W carrying a single EBOV gp conferred robust systemic immune response and mucosal neutralizing antibodies, indicating that the recombinant virus could be utilized as a viral vector for plug-and-play universal platform in mucosal vaccine development.

AB The intracellular nature of Brucella leads to rise in oxidative stress due to bacterial invasion, particularly at the site of predilection spleen and lymph nodes. The present study aimed to evaluate the erythrocytic and tissue specific oxidative stress responses induced during oil adjuvant killed Brucella melitensis vaccination. The results of the study clearly implicated a significant increase in level of catalase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and lipid peroxidation (LPG), and total protein content in erythrocytes after vaccination. The activity of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) was unaltered during the period of experiment. The catalase activity and GSH content was significantly increased in lung and spleen tissues. The tissues GST levels increased significantly in all tissues, while tissue SOD level increased significantly only in lung tissues. Thus, it can be inferred that oil adjuvant based Brucella vaccine induces negligible signs of inflammatory pathophysiology and supports the development of significant level of protection against virulent Brucella challenge.

AB Background: Few studies have measured the burden of adult pneumococcal disease after the introduction of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) into the US infant vaccination schedule. Further, most data regarding pneumococcal serotypes are derived from invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), which represents only a fraction of all adult pneumococcal disease burden. Understanding which pneumococcal serotypes cause pneumonia in adults is critical for informing current immunization policy. The objective of this study was to measure the proportion of radiographically-confirmed (CXR+) community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by PCV13 serotypes in hospitalized US adults.
   Methods: This observational, prospective surveillance study recruited hospitalized adults aged >= 18 years from 21 acute care hospitals across 10 geographically-dispersed cities in the United States between October 2013 and September 2016. Clinical and demographic data were collected during hospitalization. Vital status was ascertained 30 days after enrollment. Pneumococcal serotypes were detected via culture from the respiratory tract and normally-sterile sites (including blood and pleural fluid). Additionally, a novel, Luminex-based serotype-specific urinary antigen detection (UAD) assay was used to detect serotypes included in PCV13.
   Results: Of 15,572 enrolled participants, 12,055 eligible patients with CXR+CAP were included in the final analysis population. Mean age was 64.1 years and 52.7% were aged >= 65 years. Common comorbidities included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (43.0%) and diabetes mellitus (28.6%). PCV13 serotypes were detected in 552/12,055 (4.6%) of all patients and 265/6347 (4.2%) of those aged >65 years. Among patients aged 18-64 years PCV13 serotypes were detected in 3.8-5.3% of patients depending on their risk status.
   Conclusions: After implementation of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccination program in US children, and despite the herd protection observed in US adults, a persistent burden of PCV13-type CAP remains in this population. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB There is a growing interest in the possible relationship between rotavirus (RV) vaccine and hospitalizations due to childhood seizures. We explored variation in hospitalization rates after 9 years of vaccination against pre-vaccination period for children <5 years of age from Galicia (Northwest Spain) before and after the introduction of the RV vaccines. Hospitalization rates for childhood seizures in Galician children were compared before and after RV vaccine introduction (in 2007) using different statistical approaches, including time series analyses. Our study cohort totaled 7,712 children <5 years of age admitted to hospital between 2002 and 2015 for "all kind of childhood seizures". Hospitalization rates decreases steadily with reductions ranging from 22.3% (95% CI: 15.0-29.1) in 2008, to 50.9% (95% CI: 45.5-55.7) in 2014, and significant results were also observed for <1, 1, and 2-year-old children in comparison with pre-vaccination period hospitalization rate. Regression models indicate a negative association between RV vaccination and hospitalizations for all kind of seizures. In addition, time series analyses are consistent with this finding and predict that vaccination coverage will affect hospitalization rates for "all kind of seizures" after 9 months. The results strongly support that RV vaccination has significantly reduced hospitalization rates due to childhood seizures. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The qualitative study aims to understand and conceptualize Chinese medical students' practices and perceptions towards vaccination. Focus groups (n = 5) were conducted through convenience sampling in a medical university in October 2016 in Anhui, China. Two years later, 6 participants among them were follow-up interviewed. All the interviews were audio-recorded, then transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using constant comparative method. Opinions of 22 participants (13 females, 9 males) were collected. Results revealed that hepatitis B vaccination was discussed the most frequently, and most of participants were vaccinated against (or had documented immunity to) hepatitis B before or during their clinical internship. None of the participants reported other vaccines uptake. Three dimensions of themes were identified: (i) at individual level, the factor "feeling less infection risk" might strengthen their perceived barriers. The factors "laziness" and "fluke mind" would be used to rationalize their inactive practices about vaccination; (ii) at social level, themes involved "inactive organizational behaviors", "suggestions from people around", and "social norms". Decision-making of medical students' vaccination was more relying on themselves and influenced more by their classmates before or during their internship, rather than being influenced more by their families/universities as before. (iii) at professional level, there are two contradictions about the participants' behaviors and attitudes. One is that they may have inappropriate behaviors because of their lack of knowledge, but sometimes they seem too satisfied about their medical knowledge to vaccination. The other is that there are both vigilance response and desensitization to occupational infection risk. It is suggested that efforts should be strengthened to spread scientific knowledge of infectious diseases and immunization as long as medical students enter the university. Publicity and organizational activities should be strengthened, and related researches should be carried out by the government or scholars. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) plays an important role in regulating the activities of other components downstream of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and maintaining the normal reproductive cycle of animals. However, the molecular mechanisms by which GnRH synthesis and secretion are regulated in sheep remains unclear. In this study, a series of eight recombinant vectors with deletion fragments were constructed and cotransfected with pGL3-Basic and pRL-SV40 into sheep hypothalamic neuronal cells. After treatment with 1 nM kisspeptin, the core promoter of the sheep GnRH gene was identified to be in the region of -1912 bp to -1461 bp by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Bioinformatics analysis showed that there was a binding site for the transcription factor Otx-2 in the core promoter region (- 1786 to -1770 bp) that was highly conserved among different species. The expression patterns of Kiss-1, Otx-2 and GnRH in the sheep hypothalamus were the same, and the expression of Kiss-1, Otx-2 and GnRH was significantly higher in the breeding season than in nonbreeding season (P < 0.01). In addition, when hypothalamic neurons were cultured in vitro with kisspeptin, kisspeptin induced the expression of GnRH and Otx-2. In conclusion, these results provide evidence that the core promoter region (-1786 to -1770 bp) of the GnRH gene is involved in the regulation of hypothalamic activity by kisspeptin and that binding of the transcription factor Otx-2 mediates this activation.

AB Epigallocatechin-3-O-(3-O-methyl) gallate (EGCG3 '' Me) in tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) is a major source of O-methylated catechin and renowned for a wide range of health effects. However, the transcriptional regulation mechanisms of EGCG3 '' Me biosynthesis remain unclear. In the present work, the basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factor, designated as CsbHLH62, belonging to GBOF group of bHLH families, was isolated and characterized from Camellia sinensis. CsbHLH62 contains an Open Reading Frame of 1662 bp and encodes a polypeptide of 553 amino acids. Subcellular location and transcriptional activity analysis showed it as a nucleus protein and possessed transcriptional inhibition activity. Furthermore, the expression of CsbHLH62 was decreased during EGCG3 '' Me accumulation. More importantly, E-box motifs (5'-CANNTG-3') were found in the promoters of CCoAOMT, CsLAR, and CsDFR, and further transient expression assays showed that CsbHLH62 repressed the transcription of CCoAOMT, CsLAR, and CsDFR. Collectively, these results suggest that CsbHLH62 acts as a transcriptional repressor that might be negatively affecting the accumulation of EGCG3 '' Me. These findings provide novel insights into the regulatory mechanism of EGCG3"Me biosynthesis, which might help to breed high EGCG3 '' Me-content tea plants.

AB Purpose: Asthenozoospermia (ASZ) is a condition characterized by reduced sperm motility in semen affecting approximately 19% of infertile men. Major risk factors, particularly gene mutations, still remain unknown. The main aim of the present study was to identify novel genes and mutations that may influence human sperm motility.
   Methods: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on a large pedigree of infertile men (n = 5) followed by bioinformatics analyses. Candidate pathogenic variants were screened in a control cohort of 400 ancestry-matched Iranian fertile men, 30 unrelated men with idiopathic ASZ, and public databases.
   Results: A rare mutation in GFPT2 gene (c.1097G > A; p.Arg366Gln) located in the SIS 1 domain was segregated with the phenotype and was consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. The in silico analyses revealed that the mutation might affect the function of SIS 1 domain and abolish its carbohydrate-binding ability.
   Conclusion Homozygosity of the GFPT2 p.Arg366Gln mutation was associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in spermatozoa and decreased sperm motility.

AB Watercress (Nasturtium officinale R. Br.), an aquatic leafy vegetable of the Brassicaceae family, is known as a nutritional powerhouse. Here, we de novo sequenced and assembled the complete chloroplast (cp) genome of watercress based on combined PacBio and Illumina data. The cp genome is 155,106 bp in length, exhibiting a typical quadripartite structure including a pair of inverted repeats (IRA and IRB) of 26,505 bp separated by a large single copy (SSC) region of 84,265 bp and a small single copy (SSC) region of 17,831 bp. The genome contained 113 unique genes, including 79 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNAs and 4 rRNAs, with 20 duplicate in the IRs. Compared with the prior cp genome of watercress deposited in GenBank, 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 27 indels were identified, mainly located in noncoding sequences. A total of 49 repeat structures and 71 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were detected. Codon usage showed a bias for A/T-ending codons in the cp genome of watercress. Moreover, 45 RNA editing sites were predicted in 16 genes, all for C-to-U transitions. A comparative plastome study with Cardamineae species revealed a conserved gene order and high similarity of protein-coding sequences. Analysis of the Ka/Ks ratios of Cardamineae suggested positive selection exerted on the ycf2 gene in watercress, which might reflect specific adaptations of watercress to its particular living environment. Phylogenetic analyses based on complete cp genomes and common protein-coding genes from 56 species showed that the genus Nasturtium was a sister to Cardamine in the Cardamineae tribe. Our study provides valuable resources for future evolution, population genetics and molecular biology studies of water-cress.

AB Angiogenesis is essential for tumor metastasis. Our previous study has revealed that miR-622 inhibits colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis. Here, we aimed to explore the effects and potential molecular mechanisms of action of miR-622 on angiogenesis. We found that overexpression of miR-622 inhibited CRC angiogenesis in vitro, according to suppression of proliferation, migration, tube formation, and invasiveness of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with a tumor cell-conditioned medium derived from Caco-2 or HT-29 cells. Likewise, enhanced miR-622 expression suppressed CRC angiogenesis in vivo as determined by the measurement of Ki67 and VEGFA levels and microvessel density (by immunostaining). CXCR4, encoding a positive regulator of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), was shown to be a direct target of miR-622. Overexpression of CXCR4 attenuated the inhibition of VEGFA expression by miR-622 and reversed the loss of tumor angiogenesis caused by miR-622. Taken together, these data show that miR-622 inhibits CRC angiogenesis by suppressing the CXCR4-VEGFA signaling axis, which represents a promising target for developing a new therapeutic strategy against CRC.

AB Ribes diacanthum Pall. (Grossulariaceae), a species with dioecious, unixsexual flowers, has great economic and medicinal value and is widespread in northeastern China. After the initiation of intact floral organs, male flowers develop an abnormal stigma, and female flowers develop fading stamens incapable of pollination. To explore the genes governing dioecious unisexual floral development in R. diacanthum, we used high-throughput sequencing to obtain transcriptome data for male and female inflorescences and analyzed expression patterns of candidate genes at various developmental stages of male and female flowers. The combined transcriptomic data were successfully assembled into 72,791 transcripts (N50 = 1467) and 48,600 unigenes (N50 = 1378); 62% of the unigenes were annotated by NR, Swissprot, KEGG, GO and COG database based on orthology. Analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed that 2785 annotated genes were differentially expressed, and significantly more genes were male-biased than were female-biased in expression in the inflorescences. Both male and female flowers were found to be complete hermaphroditic flowers during early floral development; sex determination was a late event. Several MADS-box genes such as comp53946_c0 (putative AGL11) might be directly correlated with the establishment of sexual dimorphism. The sex-specific transcripts and genes identified may regulate coordinated events during floral development and be involved in the molecular regulation of dioecious, unisexual floral development in R. diacanthum. The transcriptome from the male and the female inflorescences will provide a valuable reference for further functional research on the development of dioecious, unisexual flowers.

AB Epigenetic regulatory changes alter the gene regulation function of DNA repeat elements in cancer and consequently promote malignant phenotypes. Some short tandem repeat sequences, distributed throughout the human genome, can play a role as cis-regulatory elements of the genes. Distributions of tandem long (>= 10) and short (< 10) A-T repeats in the genome are different depending on gene functions. Long repeats are more commonly found in housekeeping genes and may regulate genes in harmonious fashion. Mononucleotide A-repeats around transcription start sites interact with Argonaute proteins (AGOs) to regulate gene expression. miRNA-bound AGO alterations in cancer have been reported; consequently, these changes would affect genes containing mononucleotide A- and T-repeats. Here, we showed an unprecedented hallmark of gene regulation in cancer. We evaluated the gene expression profiles reported in the Gene Expression Omnibus and found a high density of 13-27 A-T repeats in the up-regulated genes in malignancies derived from the bladder, cervix, head and neck, ovary, vulva, breast, colon, liver, lung, prostate, kidney, thyroid, adrenal gland, bone, blood cells, muscle and brain. Transfection of cell-penetrating protein tag AGO1 containing poly uracils (CPP-AGO1-polyUs) to the lung cancer cell lines altered gene regulation depending on the presence of long A-T repeats. CPP-AGO1-polyUs limited cell proliferation and the ability of a cancer cell to grow into a colony in lung cancer cell lines. In conclusion, long A-T repeats up-regulated many genes in cancer that can be targeted by AGO1 to change the expression of many genes and limited cancer growth.

AB Plants with purple leave attain interest because of their biological importance. A new rice mutant, purple leaf (pl) was isolated from an indicia cultivar Zhenong 34, which was induced by ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis. The genetic analyses substantiated that pl was corroborated by one recessive allele and confirmed by map based cloning using Insertion-Deletion (InDel) markers located on the long arm of chromosome 5. DNAseq data of the candidate part showed one bp insertion (`C' insertion) at +901 bp position in the 3rd exon of OsPL gene. The pl was characterized as purple leaves, sheaths and leaf senescence phenotype at late grain filling stage of growth cycle. It possessed abnormal cell with distorted chloroplasts, less chlorophyll, and increased anthocyanin content in leaves. The anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, OsPAL, OsCHS, OsANS, and OsMYB55 showed up-regulation in pl plants compared to wild type (WT). High super oxide dismutase enzyme (SOD), catalase enzyme activity (CAT), total soluble sugar (TSS) and malondialdehyde activity (MDA) were detected in the pl; contrastingly, photosynthesis linked genes were down-regulated. The germinated pl seeds showed comparatively higher temperature stress tolerance than WT. The phytohormones abscicic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA) and indole acetic acid (IAA) content were increased significantly in the pl plants. This research work will be provided information on better understanding of the molecular mechanism toward the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in rice. Therefore, OsPL gene could be a good genetic tool in marker aided backcrossing or gene editing for improving the rice cultivation in future.

AB Toxoplasma gondii is an important protozoan pathogen that infects many wild and domestic animals and causes infections in immunocompromised humans. However, there has been little investigation of the molecular evolutionary trajectories of this pathogenic protozoa using comparative genomics data. Here, we employed a comparative evolutionary genomics approach to identify genes that are under site- and lineage-specific positive selection in nine strains of T. gondii, including two closely related species, Neospora caninum and Hammondia hammondi. Based on the analyses of five coccidian core genomes, 4.5% of the 5788 core genome genes showed strong signals for positive selection in the site model. In addition, the branch-site model analyses in the nine T. gondii core genomes indicated that 2 to 20 genes underwent significant positive selection along each lineage leading to T. gondii strains. Many of the protein products encoded by the positively selected genes are secretory or surface proteins that have previously been implicated in host pathogenesis. The adaptive changes in these positively selected genes might be related to dynamic interactions between the host immune systems and might play a crucial role in the infection and pathogenic processes of T. gondii.

AB Transcriptional regulation is impacted by the organization of the genome into chromatin compartments and domains. We previously reported the application of a biochemical fractionation protocol to isolate highly enriched transcribed DNA from chicken polychromatic erythrocytes. In conjunction with next-generation DNA and RNA sequencing as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation-DNA sequencing, we identified all the active chromosomal compartments and determined their structural signatures in relation to expression levels. Highly expressed genes were found in broad dynamically highly acetylated, salt-soluble chromatin compartments, while poorly or moderately expressed genes exhibited a narrow stretch of salt-soluble chromatin limited to their 5' or body region. Here, we present the detailed characteristics, including the location of nucleosome-free regions and CpG islands, of several transcriptionally active chromatin compartments. These chromatin patterns illustrate how the salt solubility profile of a genomic region aids in the annotation of genes expressed in erythroid cells and contributes to the identification of functional features such as regulatory regions.

AB The new technologies for data analysis, such as decision tree learning, may help to predict the risk of developing diseases. The aim of the present work was to develop a pilot decision tree learning to predict overweight/obesity based on the combination of six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) located in feeding-associated genes. Genotype study was performed in 151 healthy individuals, who were anonymized and randomly selected from the TALAVERA study. The decision tree analysis was performed using the R package rpart. The learning process was stopped when 15 or less observation was found in a node. The participant group consisted of 78 men and 73 women, who 100 individuals showed body mass index (BMI) >= 25 kg/m(2) and 51 BMI < 25 kg/m(2). Chi-square analysis revealed that individuals with BMI >= 25 kg/m(2) showed higher frequency of the allelic variation Ala67Ala in AgRP rs5030980 with respect to those with BMI < 25 kg/m(2). However, the variant Thr67Ala in AgRP rs5030980 was the most frequently found in individuals with BMI < 25 kg/m(2). There were no statistical differences in the other analyzed SNPs. Decision tree learning revealed that carriers of the allelic variants AgRP (rs5030980) Ala67Ala, ADRB2 (rs1042714) Gln27Glu or Glu27Glu, INSIG2 (rs7566605) 73 + 9802 with CC or GG genotypes and PPARG (rs1801282) with the allelic variants of Alal2Ala or Prol2Pro, will most likely develop overweight/obesity (BMI >= 25 kg/m(2)). Moreover, the decision tree learning indicated that age and gender may change the developed three decision learning associated with overweight/obesity development. The present work should be considered as a pilot demonstrative study to reinforce the broad field of application of new data analysis technologies, such as decision tree learning, as useful tools for diseases prediction. This technology may achieve a potential applicability in the design of early strategies to prevent overweight/obesity.

AB Currently, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still the most common malignancy worldwide. Although miR-889 has been reported to play an important role in various malignancies, the physiological function of miR-889 in NSCLC remains unknown. This paper places emphasis on the influence of miR-889 on the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer. To detect the expression level of miR-889 in NSCLC tissues and cell lines, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay and In Situ Hybridization (ISH) were adopted in this study. Cell proliferation and colony forming ability were examined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays. Furthermore, transwell experiments were conducted to determine the influence of miR-889 on migration. KLF9 expression was evaluated by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. First, miR-889 expression was increased in the cancer tissues of non-small cell lung cancer patients (n = 40) compared with adjacent tissues. Subsequently, knockdown of miR-889 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration, while overexpression of miR-889 had the opposite effect. KLF9 may be a potential target of miR-889. In addition, upregulation of miR-889 promotes tumorigenesis in vitro, and KLF9 protein levels are also reduced. The current study suggests that miR-889 may play a potential therapeutic role for NSCLC by targeting KLF9 to control NSCLC proliferation and migration.

AB Introduction Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase deficiency (FBPase deficiency) is a rare inborn error of metabolism that affects gluconeogenesis. Ketotic hypoglycemia is the main symptom and can occur at any age, usually after long periods of fasting or during illness. The diagnosis may be achieved by measurement of the enzyme activity in a liver sample, but FBP1 analysis has become the most common approach.
   Aim To characterize the genotype of Southern Brazilian FBPase-deficient patients.
   Methodology: The FBP1 gene of six unrelated patients (one had consanguineous parents) with previous diagnoses of FBPase deficiency (enzymatic, pts A, B, D, E; genetic through Next-Generation Sequencing-NGS, pt F; enzymatic and Sanger sequencing, pt C) was first analyzed through NGS. Pathogenic variants found in NGS were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The pathogenicity of novel missense variants was evaluated through in silico analysis.
   Results: Five patients (pt A, B, D, E, F) had their genotype identified by NGS, all of them being homozygous. In Pt C, NGS detected only one pathogenic variant. Among the 11 alleles analyzed, only three variants were found, two being novel: c.958G > A and c.986T > C. In silico analysis indicated the pathogenicity of both variants. Interestingly, the three variants seem to be linked to specific haplotypes, indicating that an endogamy effect may be acting on these alleles in the population of Southern Brazil.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that NGS is a good tool for the diagnosis of FBPase deficiency. Variants c.958G > A and c.986T > C are the most prevalent variants in the country.

DT Review
DE SKIV2L; Undiagnosed; Next generation sequencing; RNA exosome; SKI
   complex
AB Tricho-hepatic-enteric syndrome (THES) is a genetically heterogeneous rare syndrome (OMIM: 222470 (THES1) and 614602 (THES2)) that typically presents in the neonatal period with intractable diarrhoea, intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR), facial dysmorphism, and hair and skin changes. THES is associated with pathogenic variants in either TTC37 or SKIV2L; both are components of the human SKI complex, an RNA exosome cofactor.
   We report an 8 year old girl who was diagnosed with THES by the Undiagnosed Disease Program-WA with compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in SKIV2L. While THES was considered in the differential diagnosis, the absence of protracted diarrhoea delayed definitive diagnosis. We therefore suggest that SKIV2L testing should be considered in cases otherwise suggestive of THES, but without the characteristic diarrhoea. We expand the phenotypic spectrum while reviewing the current knowledge on SKIV2L.

AB Cyclin-dependent protein kinase 6 (CDK6) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the cell cycle and cell proliferation in mammals, and disruption of its expression by various microRNAs has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple human cancers. In mammals, miR-34a acts as a downstream effector of p53, and thus indirectly targets Cdk6, abrogating its effects. However, no studies have been done so far to examine the mechanistic involvement of miR-34a in the silencing of cdk6 in fish. In the present study, we found that the cDNA sequence of whitefish cdk6 has a 3'UTR region that contains a binding site for miR-34a. Using a luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrated that whitefish cdk6 is a direct target of miR-34a in vitro. In order to confirm this relationship in vivo, we measured the miR-34a and cdk6 mRNA expression patterns in the liver of whitefish after short-term (8, 24, and 48 h) and long-term (14 and 28 days) exposure to microcystin-LR (MC-LR), a known hepatotoxin and tumor promoter. In contrast to the in vitro findings, we noticed an up-regulation of miR-34a and cdk6 expression after long-term MC-LR treatment. While these results indicate that both, miR-34a and cdk6 are responsive to MC-LR treatment, they do not support the presence of a miR-34a:cdk6 mRNA regulatory pair in the MC-LR-challanged whitefish liver in vivo. On the other hand, our findings suggests that cell regulatory elements, partnering with either miR-34a or cdk6, are worthy of further screening to better understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the physiological response of fish challenged with hepatotoxic environmental pollutants like microcystins.

AB Abnormal expression of miRNAs is critical for gastric cancer progression. Here, we aimed to identify the differential expression of miRNAs in normal and cancerous gastric tissues and build a nomogram for effectively predicting the survival of patients with gastric cancer. We used high-throughput miRNA data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database for this study. The discriminative capabilities and predictive accuracy of the nomogram depended on the calibration curve and concordance index (C-index), and comparisons were made between the nomogram and current gastric cancer staging systems. Data of 87 patients collected from TCGA as bootstrap resamples were used to validate the results. In total, 129 miRNAs were differential expressed, of which, prognostic function was associated with five miRNAs using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the target genes of these miRNAs were involved in various cancer-related pathways. Age, metastasis, lymph node status, T stage and the five-miRNA signature were selected as independent survival variables, in the nomogram for primary cohort multivariate analysis. According to the survival probability calibration curve, the nomogram predictions were consistent with the actual observations. The survival predicting nomogram showed a C-index of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.78), which was significantly higher than the C-index of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) seventh edition (0.60; P < 0.001). We suggest that the proposed nomogram could be used to accurately predict the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer.

AB Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology is highly expected to help researchers disclose the complexity of alternative splicing and understand its association with carcinogenesis. Alternative splicing alterations are firmly associated with multiple malignancies, in terms of functional roles in malignant transformation, motility, and/or metastasis of cancer cells. One perfect example illustrating the connection between alternative splicing and cancer is the human protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1 ) gene, previously cloned from members of our research group and involved in a variety of processes including transcription, DNA repair, and signal transduction. Two splice variants of PRMT1 (variants v.1 and v.2) are downregulated in breast cancer. In addition, PRMT1 v.2 promotes the survival and invasiveness of breast cancer cells, while it could serve as a biomarker of unfavorable prognosis in colon cancer patients. The aim of this study was the molecular cloning of novel alternative splice variants of PRMT1 with the use of 3' RACE coupled with NGS technology. Extensive bioinformatics and computational analysis revealed a significant number of 19 novel alternative splicing events between annotated exons of PRMT1 as well as one novel exon, resulting in the discovery of multiple PRMT1 transcripts. In order to validate the full sequence of the novel transcripts, RT-PCR was carried out with the use of variant-specific primers. As a result, 58 novel PRMT1 transcripts were identified, 34 of which are mRNAs encoding new protein isoforms, whereas the rest 24 transcripts are candidates for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD).

AB Background: Detecting heteroplasmic variations in the mitochondrial genome can help identify potential pathogenic possibilities, which is significant for disease prevention. The development of next-generation sequencing changed the quantification of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy from scanning limited recorded points to the entire mitochondrial genome. However, due to the presence of nuclear mtDNA homologous sequences (nuMTs), maximally retaining real variations while excluding falsest heteroplasmic variations from nuMTs and sequencing errors presents a dilemma.
   Results: Herein, we used an improved method for detecting low-frequency mtDNA heteroplasmic variations from whole genome sequencing data, including point variations and short-fragment length alterations, and evaluated the effect of this method. A two-step alignment was designed and performed to accelerate data processing, to obtain and retain the true mtDNA reads and to eliminate most nuMTs reads. After analyzing whole genome sequencing data of K562 and GM12878 cells, similar to 90% of heteroplasmic point variations were identified in MitoMap. The results were consistent with the results of an amplification refractory mutation system qPCR. Many linkages of the detected heteroplasmy variations were also discovered.
   Conclusions: Our improved method is a simple, efficient and accurate way to mine mitochondrial low-frequency heteroplasmic variations from whole genome sequencing data. By evaluating the highest misalignment possibility caused by the remaining nuMTs-like reads and sequencing errors, our procedure can detect mtDNA heteroplasmic variations whose heteroplasmy frequencies are as low as 0.2%.

AB Oral tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells, such as periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) and gingival mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs), possess different biological characteristics, but the molecular mechanism remains unclear, which restricts their application in tissue engineering. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to be significant regulators of gene expression, but our knowledge about their roles in the regulation of stem cell biological properties is still limited. This study compared the lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles between PDLSCs and GMSCs through microarray analysis, and applied bioinformatics methods to analyze and predict the function and connection of differentially expressed genes, aiming to screen potential key regulators of diverse biological characteristics in PDLSCs and GMSCs. Microarray analysis showed that 2162 lncRNAs and 1347 mRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between PDLSCs and GMSCs. Gene ontology (GO) analysis and pathway analysis indicated that these differentially expressed genes were involved in diverse biological processes and signaling pathways. The gene signal network and pathway relation network predicted some potentially important regulators. The coding-noncoding gene coexpression network (CNC network) revealed many potential lncRNA-mRNA connection pairs that participated in the regulation of biological behaviors. These results stressed the roles of lncRNAs in controlling stem cell biological behaviors and provided guides for molecular mechanistic study of different biological characteristics in PDLSCs and GMSCs.

AB The fundamental objective pursued in this work is to investigate how liposomes formed with a thermodynamically optimized molar composition formed by the main components of the stratum corneum matrix behave on the human skin surface when used as drug delivery systems. To this purpose we engineered liposomes using phosphatidylcholines, ceramides and cholesterol. The specific molar ratio of the three components was established after studying the mixing properties of the lipid monolayers of the lipid components formed at the air-water interface. Liposomes loaded and unloaded with ibuprofen and hyaluronic acid were characterized by quasi-elastic light scattering and fluorescence polarization. Optimized liposomes, with and without drugs, were applied onto human skin and the structures formed evaluated using atomic force microscopy. Since penetration enhancers improve the permeation of the drugs encapsulated, we also examined the effects of Tween (R) 80 on the physical properties of the liposomes and on their extensibility over skin.
   In the present work we were able to observe the deposition and extension of liposomes in suspension onto human skin demonstrating the potential of liposomes without a secondary vehicle for releasing drugs in transdermal applications.

AB Particle size distribution (PSD) variability in excipients is widely thought to affect the mixing process and the achievement of blend homogeneity. Yet, few studies have addressed this issue by attempting to ascertain the relationship and elucidate its mechanism. To address this, the model material, lactose, was modified to reflect commercially relevant PSD variations and mixed with microcrystalline cellulose and chlorpheniramine in a double-cone blender. Multivariate modelling and avalanche testing were applied to elucidate the relationship and mechanism. PSD variability can cause significant change in mixing time, by 8 times and 3 times (p = 0.00) for high and low dose drug formulations, respectively. Achievement of blend homogeneity depended on the dispersive mixing mechanism (r(2) = 0.99). Dispersive mixing was adversely affected by powder cohesiveness and powder dilation, which increased as the proportion of fine particles in lactose powder increased. This study yielded three conclusions. Firstly, PSD variability in pharmaceutical grade excipients can cause unacceptable prolongation in mixing time. Secondly, the impact of PSD variability on continuous mixing and other batch mixing of various scales, requires investigation. Lastly, the current findings can contribute to the development of robust mixing operations in the form of offline pre-emptive measures and inline process control strategies.

AB Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a naturally occurring, powerful anti-oxidant with the potential to deliver numerous benefits to the skin when applied topically. However, topical use of this compound is currently restricted by an instability in traditional formulations and the delivery and eventual fate of precursor compounds has been largely unexplored. Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) is an emerging technique in the field of skin research and offers detailed chemical analysis, with high mass and spatial resolution, as well as profiling capabilities that allow analysis as a function of sample depth. This work demonstrates the successful use of ToF-SIMS to obtain, in situ, accurate 3D permeation profiles of both ascorbic acid and a popular precursor, ascorbyl glucoside, from ex vivo porcine skin. The significant permeation enhancing effect of a supramolecular hydrogel formulation, produced from an amphiphilic gemini imidazolium-based surfactant, was also demonstrated for both compounds. Using ToF-SIMS, it was also possible to detect and track the breakdown of ascorbyl glucoside into ascorbic acid, elucidating the ability of the hydrogel formulation to preserve this important conversion until the targeted epidermal layer has been reached. This work demonstrates the potential of ToFSIMS to provide 3D permeation profiles collected in situ from ex vivo tissue samples, offering detailed analysis on compound localisation and degradation. This type of analysis has significant advantages in the area of skin permeation, but can also be readily translated to other tissue types.

AB Dense colonization of mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa within the self-secreted extracellular matrix (mainly alginate), called biofilm, is a principal reason for the failure of antimicrobial therapy in cystic fibrotic patients. Alginate is a key component in the biofilm of mucoid P. aeruginosa and responsible for surface adhesion and stabilization of biofilm. To overcome this problem, alginate lyase functionalized chitosan nanoparticles of ciprofloxacin were developed for the effective treatment of P. aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis patients. The developed nanoparticles were found to have desired quality attributes and demonstrated sustained release following the Higuchi release kinetics. Drug compatibility with the chitosan was confirmed by FTIR while powder X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the entrapment of drug within the nanoparticle matrix. Lactose adsorbed NPs showed promising aerodynamic property. Nanoparticles showed prolonged MIC and significant reduction in biofilm aggregation and formation in planktonic bacterial suspension. Nanoparticles exhibited significantly higher inhibitory effect against biofilm of P. aeruginosa and reduced the biomass, thickness and density confirmed by confocal microscopy. Furthermore, developed nanoparticles were haemocompatible and did not exhibit any toxicity in vitro MTT assay and in vivo on lungs male Wistar rats. The data in hand collectively suggest the proposed strategy a better alternative for the effective treatment of cystic fibrosis infections.

AB This work evaluated the suitability of various mesoporous silicas as carriers for developing an oral formulation endowed with improved dissolution properties of glibenclamide, hypoglycemic agent poorly water-soluble. The different silicas were examined for solid-state, morphology, and technological and physical-chemical properties (granulometry, specific surface area, wettability, water content, water activity, apparent density, flowability, compactability). A pairwise comparison allowed a ranking, by importance order, of the parameters examined and, for each parameter, a score was assigned to each silica type. Data statistical treatment (JMP software) indicated Neusilin (R) US2 and Syloid (R) XDP3150 as the best materials. Different loading methods were tested: physical mixing; addition of drug dissolved in a volatile solvent, subsequently evaporated; addition of drug dissolved in a solvent. Methods involving drug dissolution enabled drug amorphization and intimate dispersion within the silica porous structure. Dissolution tests indicated Syloid (R) XDP3150 as the most effective silica in enhancing drug dissolution properties, providing a release rate clearly faster than from commercial tablets. Drug amorphization, improved wettability, increased surface area of the drug, finely dispersed into the highly porous silica, were the main factors responsible for this finding. Moreover, the obtained results suggested that drug dissolution rate can be properly tuned, based on the suited choice of the silica type.

AB Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) has a great variety of pharmacological effects especially liver cancer therapy, but its poor solubility, bioavailability and liver targeting have limited its clinical use. In order to solve the aforementioned shortcomings, the TPGS-modified proliposomes loaded with ISL (ISL-TPGS-PLP) was prepared in this study. ISL-TPGS- PLP was fabricated via thin-film dispersion method and was characterized by the appearance, particle size, zeta potential and morphology. HPLC was used to evaluate entrapment efficiency (EE), in vitro release and stability of ISL-TPGS-PLP single or combined while appropriate physicochemical parameters were measured with DLS. Meanwhile, the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution were also studied after oral administration. The results demonstrated that ISL-TPGS-PLP had a mean size of 23.8 +/- 0.9 nm, high EE of 97.33 +/- 0.40%. More importantly, nearly 90% ISL was released from ISL-TPGS-PLP within 24 h while only 50% was released from ISL suspension. In the pharmacokinetics study, the area under the curve (AUC(0-24h)) of ISL-TPGS-PLP was 1.53 times higher than that of ISL suspension. The Tissue distribution study showed that the ISL released from ISL-TPGS-PLP was higher in the liver than the free ISL suspension. Altogether, ISL-TPGS-PLP could ameliorate the ISL solubility, bioavailability and liver targeting ability, suggesting that ISL-TPGS-PLP could serve as a promising nanocarrier for liver cancer therapy.

AB Polysorbate 80 is one of the most widely used solubilizing agents in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Influences of different classes of solubilizates and additives on its self-assembly characteristics are however, not sufficiently understood yet. In this manuscript, we show how common water structure making salt NaCl, and lipophilic phytochemicals like curcumin and lavender oil help in modulating the structure of Polysorbate 80 micelles in aqueous medium. Our DLS, SANS and rheological studies show that NaCl induces sphere-to-rod growth of polysorbate 80 micelles at the room temperature. Micellar solubilizations of the phytochemicals, which were found to be facilitated with increase in temperature, induce only a marginal growth of the micelles up to the highest level of solubilization. Their presence however, helps in modulating the NaCl induced micellar growth behavior in the tween 80 solutions leading to observation of micelle-to-vesicle structural transition at 2% lavender oil concentration. The phytochemical solubilized micellar solutions could be converted to alginate based hydrogel beads and patches that can freely release micellar phytochemical in aqueous medium. Our results shed light on possible ways of modulating the solubilization behavior, self-assembly characteristics and rheological properties of aqueous system of polysorbate 80, which could be important for their applications.

AB Spray drying is emerging as a promising technique to produce thermally stable powder vaccines containing viral vectors. One of the most important factors in developing dry powder vaccines is the selection of the excipient carrier, however this process is time intensive, and uses large amounts of costly viral material. In this work, an acoustic levitator modified with a hot air delivery system was evaluated for its ability to mimic spray drying and acts as a screening method for excipient selection. The ability of three binary excipient blends to stabilize a human type 5 adenovirus was evaluated through an in vitro activity assay based on the expression of green fluorescent protein. Dried particle size and shape, glass transition temperature, moisture content, and crystallinity of powders produced by levitation and spray drying were compared. The particles created in the acoustic levitator under moderate heat can be considered representative of the powders that would be produced via spray drying. Viral vector titre losses differ between the methods, however, the trends with respect to excipient performance remain the same. Key material characteristics such as particle morphology and thermal properties are conserved when using the levitator. The acoustic levitator is a good starting point for dry powder vaccine development, and can be used to identify promising excipients while consuming minimal amounts of the viral vector.

AB We present a systematic study of the role of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) content in NPs on drug skin absorption. Cholecalciferol-loaded NPs of 100 nm of diameter were prepared by flash nanoprecipitation from PLA-b-PEG copolymers of various PEG lengths. As PEG content increased in the polymer, we observed a transition from a frozen solid particle structure to a more dynamic particle structure. Skin absorption studies showed that polymer composition influenced drug penetration depending on skin condition (intact or impaired). In intact skin, highly PEGylated NPs achieved the best skin absorption, even if the penetration differences between the NPs were low. In impaired skin, on the contrary, non-PEGylated NPs (PLA NPs) promoted a strong drug deposition. Further investigations revealed that the strong drug accumulation from PLA NPs in impaired skin was mediated by aggregation and sedimentation of NPs due to the release of charged species from the skin. In contrast, the dynamic structure of highly PEGylated NPs promoted wetting of the surface and interactions with skin lipids, improving drug absorption in intact skin. Since NPs structure and surface properties determine the drug penetration mechanisms at the NP-skin interface, this work highlights the importance of properly tuning NPs composition according to skin physiopathology.

AB This study is directed towards the gentle transdermal delivery of Neurotoxin (NT) and study of the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in rats by NT loaded dissolving Microneedles (DMNs-NT). The DMNs-NT fabrication involved a two-step centrifugation method. The quadrangular pyramid shape needles had great mechanical strength. The upper part of the needle contained 15.4 +/- 0.5 mu g of drug per patch. Blank DMNs showed favorable biocompatibility and low toxicity on the chondrocyte cells. Both NT and DMNs-NT displayed anti-inflammatory capabilities ex-vitro. The results of ex-vitro evaluation of DMNs the skin penetration depth of DMNs-NT rats was higher than 70 mu m and the cumulative penetration of NT in DMNs could reach 95.8% in 4 h, whereas, the NT solution could barely penetrate the skin, thereby proving the favorable facilitation of NT transdermal delivery. The needle structure dissolved completely after 10 min in vivo and the channel on the Stratum Corneum (SC) was closed after 6 h. There was no significant adverse reaction on the skin after 15 days of administration. The pharmacodynamic study showed that DMNs-NT significantly reduced the toe swelling of RA rats and reduced the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta in serum to alleviate the injury of the ankle joints. DMNs-NT held favorable stability in 3 months. All these results established that DMNs-NT could penetrate the skin of rats in a biocompatible manner, and have a strong therapeutic effect on rat RA by transdermal delivery.

AB Excipient-free isoniazid aerosol formation and pulmonary delivery in mice are studied. An evaporation-nucleation route is used for the generation of isoniazid aerosol. Particle diameters and number concentrations are measured with an aerosol spectrometer consisting of a diffusion battery, condensation chamber, and photoelectric counter. The pulmonary delivery of isoniazid particles is studied in both nose-only (NO) and whole-body (WB) inhalation chambers for the particle mean diameter and number concentration to be 600 nm and 6 x 10(6) cm(-3), respectively. It is found that the rate of drug systemic absorption in the WB chamber is 27% higher than that for the NO one because of an additional consumption of drug orally from the fur in the WB chamber. The particle deposition efficiency epsilon in the mouse respiratory tract is measured as a function of mean diameter. The quantity e is equal to 0.7 for the particle diameter d = 10 nm and decreases to 0.2 with the diameter increasing to 300 nm, and then, at d > 300 nm the deposition efficiency increases with diameter to 0.5 at d = 2000 nm. The bioavailability of the aerosol form of isoniazid (72 +/- 10%) is very close to that for the peroral form (61 +/- 10%).

AB This research attempts to bring together the positive aspects of lipid nanoparticles and Quality by Design (QbD) approach for developing a novel drug delivery system for skin cancers and aktinic keratosis. Lipid nanoparticles which is one of the most efficacious options for topical treatment of skin diseases were prepared due to their ability to overcome the complex structure of skin barrier and to enhance the skin penetration. Since the formulation development contains complex variables of active ingredients, raw materials or production method; all the variables of the product should be elaborated. QbD approach which refers to design and develop formulations and manufacturing processes to maintain the prescribed product quality was also successfully adopted to achieve a time- and cost-saving process ensuring a high-quality product.
   5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) loaded lipid nanoparticles, both solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers, were developed and characterized by following QbD steps. Optimal lipid nanoparticle formulation with guaranteed quality which was within the design space has been reached through the artificial neural networks. The optimal lipid nanoparticle formulation which is a NLC formulation with a mean particle size of 205,8 +/- 9,34 nm, narrow size distribution (0.279 +/- 0.01) and negative zeta potantial -30,20 +/- 0,92 was produced by high pressure homogenization method. Cytotoxicity profiles of the optimal NLC was determined by cell culture studies on epidermoid carcinoma cells and human keratinocyte cells. Optimal NLC showed significantly higher anticancer effect on epidermoid carcinoma cells than free 5-FU and also less cytotoxicity towards human keratinocyte cells. Optimal NLC was formulated in hydrogel formulation for ease of application which has suitable occlusive and mechanical properties, viscocity and pH for patient complience. The cumulative amount of 5-FU in dermal tissues of rat skin was found 20.11 +/- 2.14 mu g/cm2 and 9.73 +/- 0.87 mu g/cm2 after application of NLC enriched hydrogel and 5-FU hydrogel respectively.
   In conclusion, this study showed that a time and cost saving process ensuring a high-quality product can be obtained by QbD guided formulation development study with the help of artificial neural networks. A novel semisolid dosage form enriched by NLC which is promising for topical treatment of skin cancers was developed.

AB Manufacturability of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is often evaluated by an empirical approach during development due to limited material availability. This brings challenges in designing flexible yet robust manufacturing processes under highly accelerated timelines. Hence, good utilisation of a limited material dataset is key to accelerate the delivery of high quality final drug product into the market at minimum cost and maximum process capacity. In this study, we present a data-driven method to investigate a raw materials database where the integration of multivariate analysis and machine learning modelling aids the selection of new incoming materials based on their manufacturability. The procedure was applied to an industrial representative database of thirty-four APIs and seven excipients where eight measurements relevant to flow properties for each of those forty-one materials were collected. The models identified four clusters of materials with different flow properties. These models can serve as a risk assessment tool for new API in early product development phases based on the nearest surrogate material which behave similarly, as well as to identify targeted and material sparring experiments to address key risks during secondary process selection.

DT Article
DE Die filling; Powder flow; Suction filling; Gravity filling; Rotary press
ID FLOW BEHAVIOR; AIR; DENSITY
AB In pharmaceutical tablet manufacturing, the powder formulation is filled into a die and compacted into a tablet using rigid punches. Die fill is important because it limits the productivity of tablet presses and determines key quality attributes of tablets including weight and content uniformity.
   Die fill occurs due to gravity and suction fill mechanisms. A model linear shoe-die filling system has been instrumented with pressure measurement devices for detailed characterisation of air pressure evolution as the powder mass is delivered in the die. Systematic experiments were carried out using a range of microcrystalline cellulose powders to explore the role of powder properties (such as particle size and bulk density) and operating parameters (such as shoe and die geometry, shoe and suction punch kinematics and powder filling level) on powder delivery. Existing models were found inadequate to describe the mass flow rate of powders under a diversity of gravity and suction filling conditions. The pressure measurements enabled the development of a new die fill model using the Buckingham theorem. The model includes separate terms for the contribution of the mass of powder delivered under gravity and suction fill mechanisms. The experimental procedures required to extract the parameters of the model are described. The model is applicable to the handling and dosing of fine and cohesive powders where small differences in air pressure have a significant impact on the powder flow process. The practical application of the model for predicting die filling behaviour in a high-speed rotary tablet press is demonstrated by assuming operating conditions of a typical rotary tablet press. This approach can be adapted to assist formulation design and process development for operations involving handling and dosing of fine and cohesive powders.

AB Spray drying biologics and small-molecule drugs can increase their thermal stability relative to liquid dosage forms and allow for widespread distribution to developing countries without cold chain infrastructure. In this study, pullulan trehalose powder is spray dried for inhalation. The powder is characterized in terms of manufacturability, physical stability, device compatibility, and aerosol performance. The manufacturability is demonstrated by reasonable spray drying yield and powder flowability. The powder has relatively low cohesiveness and high compressibility without semi-elastic deformation. Short-term physical stability for ambient temperature dry storage and 40 degrees C storage in commercial pressurized metered-dose inhaler propellants HFA 134a and HFA 227 is shown. A theoretical model predicts a high glass transition temperature near the surface of the microparticles where biologics are expected to reside. Emission from a commercial dry powder inhaler demonstrates high dispersibility, optimal size for inhalation, and adequate total lung dose, exceeding many commercial inhalation devices. The powder can be filled, stored, and actuated from a pressurized metered-dose inhaler without changes in particle morphology or solid phase. The pullulan trehalose platform thus appears promising for respiratory delivery.

AB This study aimed to originally investigate the roles of a surfactant in hydrophilic-hydrophobic polymer blend solid dispersions (SDs) to enhance drug dissolution. Different formulations of SDs containing a hydrophilic polymer, a hydrophobic polymer or a hydrophilic-hydrophobic blend were prepared with/without surfactant, and the crystal changes, wettability, and molecular interactions were investigated. The wettability was investigated by analysing the contact angle. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to study the physicochemical properties of the SDs. This study showed that the surfactant improved the wettability of hydrophilic-hydrophobic blend SDs. Moreover, the incorporation of the surfactant led to the minimization of drug crystals in SDs. In particular, the surfactant showed an effectiveness in drug crystalline changes with hydrophobic polymers compared to hydrophilic polymers. The maximization of reducing drug crystals was observed in an optimized blending ratio of hydrophilic-hydrophobic polymers. This result indicated that the surfactant played a key role in assisting a hydrophilic-hydrophobic polymer blend, which has been demonstrated as a dominant strategy for SDs, to enhance the dissolution rate of a poorly water-soluble drug.

AB Liposomes are promising delivery vehicles and offer the added drawcard of being able to be made functional to target tissues such as cardiac muscle and cancerous cells. Current methods to manufacture liposomes need to be improved and supercritical fluid (SCF) technologies may offer a solution. Herein, the dispersibility of six different phospholipids (PLs) was determined in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)). 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) showed the highest post-processing dispersibility, while 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), and 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) showed no dispersibility in scCO2 at the assessed experimental conditions. The zetasizer results showed that the SCF conditions at 37 degrees C, 250 bar and 200 RPM for 60 min provided nanoparticles with the narrowest polydispersity index (PDI) and a spherical shape as shown by cryo-transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM). The mean diameter of liposomes using the SCF method for DSPC-PEGylated and DOPC-PEGylated liposomes was 98.3 +/- 3.3 nm and 124.5 +/- 4.1 nm, while using the thin film method it was 153.6 +/- 4.5 nm and 131.3 +/- 3.4 nm, respectively. A size-based stability evaluation of the scCO(2)-prepared liposomes stored at different temperatures (25 degrees C, 4 degrees C and -20 degrees C) was compared to that of the thin film method over a period of 3 months. The current study provides a possible green alternative SCF method to preparing liposomes that is less laborious, time saving, and a low energy process.

AB Over the recent decade, benefits of continuous manufacturing (CM) of pharmaceutical products have been acknowledged widely. In contrast to batch processes, the product is not physically separated into batches in CM, which creates a few challenges. Product release is done for batches that should have a uniform quality over time, materials need to be tracked along the line, and locations to reject product must be established. To enable these, the residence time distributions (RTDs) of all unit operations must be known. In this paper, three CM tableting lines, each employing a different granulation technique, were investigated. The RTDs of their main unit operations were characterized, utilizing different measurement techniques successfully. All of these RTD measurement techniques could have been performed in any of the lines. The differences were related to the techniques themselves. Overall, external tracer with in-line Near-Infrared detection or color tracer with video recording proved most usable techniques, with few limitations. The RTDs for full lines were calculated by convoluting the unit operation RTDs, which enables material tracking through entire lines. The lines exhibited both truly continuous and quasi-continuous unit operations. Quasi-continuous unit operations divide the material stream into lots that can be utilized for tracking and rejection.

AB Based on the cell penetrating ability of tryptophan-containing peptides, eight linear hexapeptides have been designed, synthesized and explored their efficiency toward the synthesis of gold nanoparticles under sunlight. The peptide generated gold nanoparticles (LP-GNPs) have been characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) techniques. The binding ability of LP-GNPs toward siRNA, evaluated by gel electrophoresis indicates that sequence-selective-GNPs without any surface modifications exhibit strong affinity toward negatively charged biomolecules. Cellular uptake studies suggest that LP-GNPs exhibit significant uptake of fluorescence-labeled siRNA inside the cells as evidenced from Fluorescence Microscopy. In vitro gene silencing efficiency using newly generated GNPs revealed that above mentioned LP-GNPs efficiently down-regulate the level of GAPGH gene in colon cancer cells. Comparative gene silencing efficiency results indicate that anisotropic LP7-GNPs exhibit comparable efficacy to other existing carrier systems, such as Lipofectamine 2000 in presence of serum, mimicking in-vivo system. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that peptide-GNPs based delivery system for siRNA emerges to be effective to deliver RNAi therapeutics, uncovering new avenue in oncotherapy.

AB Biopharmaceutical development is progressing rapidly. It is imperative that novel drug delivery systems are designed to protect the integrity of the biopharmaceutical, and, at the same time, transport and distribute the drug efficaciously to the target site. Administration of highly specific and sensitive molecules, like therapeutic proteins or nucleic acid-based drugs, present distinct challenges. In this study, we investigate the topical drug delivery of 10-23 DNAzymes; short single-stranded oligonucleotides with RNA-cleaving properties. We developed different hydrogel formulations based on chitosan. These natural-based polymers are particularly suitable for biopharmaceuticals due to their high biocompatibility and biodegradability. We tested these hydrogels for penetration enhancement and for protective efficacy against DNAzymes degradation. Additionally, we examined the physicochemical characteristics and the storage stability of several hydrogel preparations. The formulations developed in this study demonstrate adequate antimicrobial activity, even without the addition of preservatives. A DNAse II degradation assay confirmed their ability to prevent enzymatic degradation of the oligonucleotide. The recovery of intact oligonucleotides in full thickness porcine skin samples indicated that hydrogel formulations composed of DNA/chitosan polyplexes provided satisfactory skin penetration.

AB Silymarin (SLM) is a hepatoprotective herbal drug characterized by low aqueous solubility and, consequently, low oral bioavailability. The objective of this study was to enhance the physiochemical properties of SLM, through preparation and optimization of lyophilized nanosuspension tablets (LNTs). LNTs were prepared by sonoprecipitation technique followed by a freeze-drying process using both polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as stabilizer and binder, and mannitol as cryoprotectant and disintegrating agent. 32 full factorial design (FFD) was applied to study the effect of independent variables at different concentrations of both PVA (X-1) and mannitol (X-2) on the dependent variables that included mean particle size (Y-1), disintegration time (Y-2), friability % (Y-3) and time required to release 90% of the drug (Y-4). Several physicochemical evaluations were implemented on the optimized formula; for instance differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffractometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. These analyses demonstrated that the drug was in an amorphous state, stable in nanosize range and displayed no chemical interaction with the polymer. Moreover, the optimized formula had highly porous structure, rapid disintegration, friability with less than 1% and noticeable improvement in saturation solubility and dissolution rate.

AB Bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeting drug, is widely used as an off-label therapeutic for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). To reduce the monthly administration frequency, this study investigated microspheres comprising a poly(D, L-lactide-co-glycolide)/poly(cyclohexane-1,4-diyl acetone dimethylene ketal) (PLGA/PCADK) blend that could be loaded with bevacizumab-dextran particles using solid-in-oil-in-water (S/O/W) emulsification. Control microspheres were also prepared through water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) emulsification. The structural stability of bevacizumab in the polymer monomers was analyzed using dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), size exclusion chromatography (SEC-HPLC), circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopy. Subsequently, microspheres were prepared and evaluated in terms of their morphology, encapsulation efficiency and release behavior. PLGA/PCADK microspheres prepared by the S/O/W method with < 20% PCADK showed a smooth spherical structure with a uniform distribution of bevacizumab. The microspheres exhibited a release behavior comprising a slight initial burst and an increasing total release over 50 days both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, the microspheres were well tolerated by ocular tissue. Finally, a chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay revealed that the bioactivity of bevacizumab was retained by PCADK. In conclusion, these results suggest the potential for bevacizumab-loaded PLGA/PCADK microspheres prepared by the S/O/W method as a means of intravitreal therapy for ocular diseases.

AB In this work, lignin was spray dried with sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) in order to improve the compaction properties of lignin. Bulk level and physicochemical properties of spray dried formulations were measured and compared to as-received lignin and lactose which was used as a reference excipient. Single component tablets from individual powders were prepared and the mechanical properties of these powders were investigated by analysing force-displacement curves recorded during tableting, using a series of compaction equations. Moreover, the performance of these excipients in binary blends containing an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) was investigated. A positive effect of SLS on the mechanical properties and bulk level properties of the spray dried formulations was observed. Spray dried formulations containing SLS showed superior flow properties to pure spray dried lignin while retaining similar particle size distributions. Spray dried formulations containing up to 10 w/w% SLS also showed superior compactibility in binary blends to as-received materials at porosity levels relevant for immediate release tablets. This study highlights the importance of understanding the compaction mechanics of single component powders as a means of predicting their behaviour in multi-component blends.

AB Azelaic acid (AZA) is a dicarboxylic acid that is topically used in the treatment of acne and rosacea since it possesses antibacterial and keratolytic activity. The primary objective of this study was to develop an AZA nanocrystal suspension. It is expected that improved solubility and dissolution rate will result in advanced biopharmaceutical properties, primarily the dermal bioavailability. Furthermore, a topical nanocrystal AZA-loaded hydrogels composed of Pluronic (R) F127 and hyaluronic acid mixture that are able to deliver AZA into the stratum corneum and deeper skin layers were considered. This study was conducted in order to: 1) determine the effect of non-ionic Polysorbate 60 on the stabilization and particle size of the AZA nanocrystals, as well as the effect of Pluronic (R) F127, used as an in situ gelation agent, and hyaluronic acid on the viscoelastic properties and the drug release of composed hydrogels, 2) determine the relationship between the rheological properties of the gels and the penetration of AZA into the stratum corneum. The composed hydrogels revealed pseudoplastic flow behaviour. The increase in Pluronic (R) F127 concentration induced a domination of elastic over viscous behaviour of the gels. The gel containing 15% of Pluronic (R) F127, 1% of hyaluronic acid and lyophilised 10% nanocrystal AZA suspension was considered to be an optimal formulation, since it possessed the rheological and drug delivery properties desirable for an in situ gelling platform for dermal application.

AB Data provided by in situ sensors is always affected by some level of impreciseness as well as uncertainty in the measurements due to process operation disturbance or material property variance. In-process data precision and reliability should be considered when implementing active product quality control and real-time process decision making in pharmaceutical continuous manufacturing. Data reconciliation is an important strategy to address such imperfections effectively, and to exploit the data redundancy and data correlation based on process understanding. In this study, a correlation between tablet weight and main compression force in a rotary tablet press was characterized by the classical Kawakita equation. A load cell, situated at the exit of the tablet press chute, was also designed to measure the tablet production rate as well as the tablet weight. A novel data reconciliation strategy was proposed to reconcile the tablet weight measurement subject to the correlation between tablet weight and main compression force, in such, the imperfect tablet weight measurement can be reconciled with the much more precise main compression force measurement. Special features of the Welsch robust estimator to reject the measurement gross errors and the Kawakita model parameter estimation to monitor the material property variance were also discussed. The proposed data reconciliation strategy was first evaluated with process control open-loop and closed-loop experimental data and then integrated into the process control system in a continuous tablet manufacturing line. Specifically, the real-time reconciled tablet weight measurements were independently verified with an at-line Sotax Auto Test 4 tablet weight measurements every five minutes. Promising and reliable performance of the reconciled tablet weight measurement was demonstrated in achieving process automation and quality control of tablet weight in pilot production runs.

AB Pharmaceutical companies are relying more often on external sources of innovation to boost their discovery research productivity. However, more in-depth knowledge about how external innovation may translate to successful product launches is still required in order to better understand how to best leverage the innovation ecosystem. We analyzed the pre-approval publication histories for FDA-approved new molecular entities (NMEs) and new biologic entities (NBEs) launched by 13 top research pharma companies during the last decade (2006-2016). We found that academic institutions contributed the majority of pre-approval publications and that publication subject matter is closely aligned with the strengths of the respective innovator. We found this to also be true for candidate drugs terminated in Phase 3, but the volume of literature on these molecules is substantially less than for approved drugs. This may suggest that approved drugs are often associated with a more robust dataset provided by a large number of institutes. Collectively, the results of our analysis support the hypothesis that a collaborative research innovation environment spanning across academia, industry and government is highly conducive to successful drug approvals.

AB The current study aimed to develop an effective transdermal nanovesicular carrier of diflunisal that provides enhanced delivery through the skin. Two types of nanovesicles, ethosomes and transfersomes, were investigated and compared to conventional liposomes. Ethosomes with variable ethanol contents (10, 30 and 50%) and transfersomes using different edge activators, including sodium deoxycholate, sodium cholate and sodium taurocholate, were prepared and characterized. The obtained vesicles revealed good entrapment efficiencies (46.73-65.99%), nanometric vesicle sizes (453.10-796.80 nm) and negative zeta potential values (-45.40 to -86.90 mV). Ethosomes with 30% ethanol and sodium deoxycholate-containing transfersomes were incorporated into hydrogels to evaluate their in vitro release and permeation patterns. Nanovesicular hydrogels exhibited more sustained diflunisal release than did corresponding dispersions. Compared to liposomal hydrogel, both carriers proved the superiority of diflunisal permeation and flux across the skin. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed improved penetration of rhodamine-loaded nanovesicles through skin layers with a wider distribution and higher fluorescence intensity. Compared to liposomes, selected nanovesicles exhibited remarkable antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects manifested by significant reduction in number of writhings and significantly higher inhibition of paw oedema. Hence, the developed nanovesicles could be considered promising carriers for transdermal delivery of diflunisal for pain and inflammation management.

AB Acoustic Emission (AE) measurement technology has gained wide appreciation in material sciences and process monitoring. In inhalation research, AE has been used for adherence indicating applications in clinical studies. Promising results from feasibility studies using AE combined with multivariate data analysis (AE-MVDA) in the analysis of devices for inhalation have prompted a broader study reported in this paper. This work presents the novel application of AE-MVDA for assessment of the combined inhalation device and formulation performance. The purpose is to evaluate the benefits that this technology can provide to inhalation product development programs. The work was carried out using two different dry powder inhaler device model systems while investigating different performance features. The devices were filled with dry powder formulations with both placebo and with active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). The acquired AE data was analyzed using multivariate data analysis tools such as Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projections to latent structures (OPLS). The AE profiles were indicative for device and formulation performance. Normal and deviating performances were readily picked up in the AE data. Moreover, performance trends between doses withdrawn from the inhalers were also observable. Lastly, differences in the AE profile between the formulations could be detected. The overall conclusion from the AE-MVDA measurement approach evaluation is that it has the potential to add value as a cost-effective, non-invasive quality and performance monitoring technology both in development and in production of inhaled medicines.

AB Nanoparticles such as liposomes have been applied for the treatment of various diseases such as cancer and inflammatory diseases by utilizing the enhanced permeability and retention effect. However, their entry into inflammation sites is still limited since passive delivery of nanoparticles is often hampered by the presence of endothelial barriers. As leukocytes can pass through the inflamed endothelium via utilizing membrane protein functions, we hypothesized that incorporating leukocyte membrane proteins onto liposomal membranes may impart leukocyte-mimicking functions to liposomes, allowing for their adherence to and active passage through the inflamed endothelium. Herein, we developed leukocyte-mimetic liposomes (LM-Lipo) by leukocyte membrane protein transfer and evaluated their function in vitro. Transfer of membrane proteins from human leukemia cells onto liposomal membranes allowed for significant association of the liposomes with inflamed human endothelial cells, and subsequent passage through inflamed endothelial cell layer. The confocal images showed that LM-Lipo significantly induced vascular endothelial-cadherin displacement. These results indicate that LM-Lipo adhered to and regulated intercellular junctions of inflamed endothelial cell layer, resulting in passage through the layer, by mimicking the function of leukocytes. Furthermore, it is suggested that liposomes possessing leukocyte-like functions could be useful for drug delivery to inflammation sites by overcoming endothelial barriers.

AB Rational design of novel ionizable lipids for development of lipid-nucleic acid nanoparticles (LNP) is required for safe and effective systemic gene delivery for osteoporosis. LNPs require suitable characteristics for intravenous administration and effective accumulation in bone marrow for enhanced transfection. Hence, lipids with C18 tail and ionizable headgroup (Boc-His-ODA/BHODA and His-ODA/HODA) were synthesized and characterized physicochemically. LNPs were prepared with bone morphogenetic protein-9 gene (BHODA-LNP, HODA-LNP, and bone-homing peptide targeted HODA-LNP - HODA-LNPT). Thorough physicochemical (electrolyte stability, DNase I and serum stability) and biological (hemolysis, ROS induction, cytotoxicity and transfection) characterization was carried out followed by acute toxicity studies and therapeutic performance studies in ovariectomized rat model. Lipids with pH dependent ionization were successfully synthesized. LNPs thereof were similar to 100 nm size with stability against electrolytes, DNase I and serum and exhibited low hemolytic potential demonstrating suitability for intravenous administration. LNPs exhibited minimal cytotoxicity, non-significant ROS induction and high transfection. In vivo studies demonstrated safety and improved bone regeneration in OVX rats with HODA-LNPT showing significantly better performance. Synthesized ionizable lipids offer safe and effective alternative for preparation of LNPs for gene delivery. Targeted BMP-9 LNP show potential for systemic osteoporosis treatment.

AB Knowledge-based experimental design can aid biopharmaceutical high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments needed to identify critical manufacturability parameters. Prior knowledge can be obtained via computational methods such as protein property extraction from 3-D protein structures. This study presents a high-throughput 3-D structure preparation and refinement pipeline that supports structure screenings with an automated and data-dependent workflow. As a case study, three chimeric virus-like particle (VLP) building blocks, hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) dimers, were constructed. Molecular dynamics (MD) refinement quality, speed, stability, and correlation to zeta potential data was evaluated using different MD simulation settings. Settings included 2 force fields (YASARA2 and AMBER03) and 2 pKa computation methods (YASARA and H++). MD simulations contained a data-dependent termination via identification of a 2 ns Window of Stability, which was also used for robust descriptor extraction. MD simulation with YASARA2, independent of pKa computation method, was found to be most stable and computationally efficient. These settings resulted in a fast refinement (6.6-37.5 h), a good structure quality (-1.17- -1.13) and a strong linear dependence between dimer surface charge and complete chimeric HBcAg VLP zeta potential. These results indicate the computational pipeline's applicability for early-stage candidate assessment and design optimization of HTS manufacturability or formulability experiments.

AB Sustained pulmonary delivery of tobramycin from microparticles composed of drug/polymer nanocomplexes offers several advantages against traditional delivery methods. Namely, in patients with cystic fibrosis, microparticle delivery can protect the tobramycin being delivered from strong mucoadhesive interactions, thus avoiding effects on its diffusion toward the infection site. Polymeric ion-pair complexes were obtained starting from two synthetic polyanions, through impregnation of their solid dissociated forms with tobramycin in aqueous solution. The structure of these polymeric systems was characterized, and their activities were examined against various biofilm-forming Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Once dried, the nanocomplexes can change their aggregation state, to form microparticle-based aggregates with a spherical shape and a micrometer size. In aqueous dispersions, the ion-pair complexes produced had nanometric size, negative zeta potential, and high biocompatibility toward human bronchial epithelium cells. The antibiofilm activity of these formulations was more efficient than for free tobramycin, with the antibiofilm activity against P. aeruginosa mucoid and nonmucoid end-stage strains isolated from cystic fibrosis lungs being of particular relevance.

AB In order to further explain the ability of gelatin 50PS and bovine serum albumin (BSA) to generate supersaturation of a series of poorly soluble drugs (carbamazepine, cinnarizine, diazepam, itraconazole, nifedipine, indomethacin, darunavir (ethanolate), ritonavir, fenofibrate, griseofulvin, ketoconazole, naproxen, phenylbutazone and phenytoin), drug-polymer binding was investigated using solution NMR and equilibrium dialysis experiments. Binding characteristics of the biopolymers were compared to those of PVP, PVPVA and HPMC. Since both biopolymers are prone to enzymatic digestion, we evaluated the influence of proteolytic enzymes like pepsin and pancreatin on the dissolution properties of poorly soluble compounds when formulated as amorphous solid dispersions with gelatin 50PS and BSA. Evidence is being presented that supports the importance of drug-polymer binding in inducing and stabilizing supersaturation of poorly soluble drugs and enhancing dissolution from ASDs. In fact, BSA displayed drug binding with nearly all tested model drugs while in case of gelatin 50PS binding was observed for 5 out of 12 drugs. Addition of pepsin or pancreatin during dissolution of the biopolymer-containing ASDs leads to a drop in the concentration of the drug pointing to enzymatic digestion of the gelatin and BSA. However, after digestion, these formulations still outperformed their crystalline counterparts.

AB The dynamic properties of water and polymer molecules in xanthan hydrogels at different polymer mass fractions were investigated through the combination of conventional and fast-field cycling NMR relaxation to obtain the information about dynamics in different time scales. The results showed that water dynamics were faster in diluted than in concentrated hydrogels. However, the type of polymer-chain dynamics did not change for xanthan fractions from 0.1 to 0.5, although they slowed at higher xanthan fractions as the system approached transition to the glass state. The addition of the nonionic small drug molecules pentoxifylline did not change the dynamics in the hydrogels, but they were affected by the medium pH. The water and polymer-chain dynamics were faster in the hydrogels for the neutral than the acid medium. These differences resulted in slower swelling and thinner and more rigid hydrogel layer of the matrix tablet in the acid medium that was less susceptible to erosion. Consequently, pentoxifylline release from xanthan tablets in acid medium is dominated by drug diffusion. At neutral pH, the molecular mobility is greater, which resulted in rapid and extensive swelling of the hydrogel, leading to erosion-dominated drug release.

AB Ceramides (Cers) are significant constituents of the stratum corneum (SC), the uppermost skin layer responsible for skin barrier properties. Cers are a heterogeneous group of lipids whose mutual interactions are still unclear. To better understand these interactions, we characterized model membranes containing stearic acid, cholesterol, cholesterol sulfate and one or more of the following ceramides: N-stearoyl-sphingosine (CerNS), N-stearoyl-phytosphingosine (CerNP) and N-(2-hydroxy) stearoyl-phytosphingosine (CerAP). Small angle X-ray scattering and FTIR spectroscopy were used to study lipid arrangement, phase separation and thermotropic behaviour. In the one-Cer systems, the membranes with CerNP showed strong hydrogen bonding and significant phase separation, even after phase transition, while the systems containing CerAP and CerNS had increased lipid miscibility. The multi-Cer systems exhibited different behaviour. In particular, the membrane containing all three Cers was a highly miscible system with narrow one-step phase transition, which, of all the studied samples, occurred at the lowest temperatures. Our results show that even a small variation in Cer structure results in substantially different phase behaviour, which is further affected by the presence of other Cer subclasses. Interestingly, the phase behaviour of the most complex three-Cer system was simpler than that of the others, highlighting the importance of lipid diversity in real SC.

AB Fast dissolution of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is a prerequisite from patient perspective. However, most NSAIDs are slowly dissolving acidic compounds. Caffeine, a commonly used analgesic adjuvant with NSAIDs showed high potential as eutectic co-former for acidic compounds. The study investigated eutectic forming potential of caffeine with meloxicam, aceclofenac and flurbiprofen. Each drug was co-ground with caffeine in various ratios and the products were characterized by thermal analysis to determine the optimum eutectic composition from phase diagram and Tamman's triangle. The optimum systems were subjected to X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and dissolution studies. Co-ground systems at dose ratio were also assessed for drug dissolution and anti-inflammatory effect using carrageenan induced rat paw edema method. Eutexia was confirmed by thermal analysis with the optimum composition being 1: 1, 1: 1 and 1: 2 (NSAID: caffeine) for aceclofenac, flurbiprofen and meloxicam, respectively. Eutexia did not alter FTIR spectra with minor changes being recorded in XRPD patterns. The eutectic systems underwent fast liberation of drugs with fast dissolution being retained even at dose ratios. Dissolution enhancement was associated with enhanced anti-inflammatory response. The study introduced caffeine as eutectic forming analgesic for fixed dose combination with NSAIDs to enhance drug dissolution and anti-inflammatory effect.

AB The time-temperature superposition principle (TTSP) was applied to the destabilization kinetics of a pharmaceutical emulsion. The final goal of this study is to predict precisely the emulsion stability after long-term storage from the short-period accelerated test using TTSP. As the model emulsion, a cream preparation that is clinically used for the treatment of pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease was tested. After storage at high temperatures ranging from 30 to 45 degrees C for designated periods, the emulsion state was monitored using magnetic resonance imaging, and then the phase separation behaviors observed were analyzed according to the Arrhenius approach applying TTSP. The Arrhenius plot showed a biphasic change around 35 degrees C, indicating that the separation behaviors of the sample were substantially changed between the lower (30-35 degrees C) and higher (35-45 degrees C) temperature ranges. This study also monitored the coalescence behavior using a backscattered light measurement. The experiment verified that the destabilization was initiated by coalescence of oil droplets and then it eventually led to obvious phase separation via creaming. Furthermore, we note the coalescence kinetics agreed well with the phase separation kinetics. Therefore, in the case of the sample emulsion, the coalescence behavior has a dominant influence on the destabilization process. This study offers a profound insight into the destabilization process of pharmaceutical emulsions and demonstrates the promising applicability of TTSP to pharmaceutical research.

AB The aim of this study is to establish a contamination-free milling method using ice beads instead of conventional hard beads such as metal or ceramics. Ice beads, which melt after the milling process to form water, would solve the contamination issue attributed to bead breakage or abrasion. The technique/method for preparing spherical ice beads of mono-dispersed size ranging from 150 to 3000 mu m was newly developed. An oscillation beads milling apparatus was used for pulverization. In the initial stages of ice beads milling, the process is dry, but as time passes, the surface of the ice beads begins to melt, resulting in a transition to wet beads milling. It was found that ice beads are an effective milling media for beads milling, and that milling efficiency is strongly affected by the temperature of the coolant, with the peak efficiency occurring when the temperature was set to -2 degrees C and ice beads around 1500 mu m in diameter were used. The spray-dried powder obtained from suspension after ice beads milling had dissolution improvement equivalent to that obtained after zirconia beads milling, resulting from its spontaneous rapid dispersion into nanosuspension.

AB Intranasal delivery of nebulized drugs with the consideration of the nasal anatomy is not adequately studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate nasal and paranasal drug delivery with nebulizers, with and without pulsating airflow, in three anatomically-different nasal models in different age groups, considering normal and bidirectional breathing techniques. Anatomically-accurate nasal models of 2-, 5-, and 50-year old subjects were developed and tested to quantify sub-regional deposition of an aqueous solution of a model drug, nebulized with PARI SinuStar (TM) and Sinus (TM) nebulizers. Paranasal delivery was significantly enhanced using pulsating nebulization under bidirectional breathing administration technique for all subjects (p < 0.05). Airway morphology resulted in significantly different drug delivery efficiency (p < 0.05). Use of a modified nasal adaptor enhanced the inhaled dose and resulted in significantly higher percent recovery, 68.41 +/- 13.56%, compared to the standard design, 10.35 +/- 1.75%. In the adult subject, paranasal delivery was equal to 19.34 +/- 1.21%, and 5.99 +/- 0.95% using PARI Sinus (TM) nebulizer, with and without pulsating airflow, respectively. In the pediatric subjects, pulsating paranasal delivery was 12.80 +/- 0.28%, but without pulsating airflow no drug reached the target. This study confirmed that bidirectional breathing and pulsating airflow are beneficial for improved paranasal aerosol delivery in children similar to previous findings for adults.

AB The development of an injectable biomaterial that supports cell survival and maintains or promotes nucleus pulposus (NP) phenotype could aid delivery of cells to degenerated NPs causing low back pain. Mesenchymal cells were loaded and grown in a synthetic peptide gel, PuraMatrix (R). Cells were observed within the gels over 0-28 days, and accumulation of glycosaminoglycans were detected by histological staining. The mechanical properties of the cell-loaded constructs, and the change of the mechanical properties were studied using stress relaxation of the gels under compression and confinement. The PuraMatrix (R) gel was shown to relax fast on compression indicating that the fluid could easily flow out of the gel, and thus indicating the presence of large pores/voids. The presence of these pores/voids was further supported by high mobility of dextran molecules, determined using fluorescence recovery after photo bleaching. The stress required to deform the cell-loaded constructs to a specific strain increases at day 21, at which point the presence of glycosaminoglycans within the cell-loaded constructs was also observed. The results provide evidence of changes in mechanical properties of the PuraMatrix (R) matrix upon excretion of the extracellular matrix by the cells.

AB The aim of this study was to develop an innovative in situ gelling suspension for effective nasal delivery of fluticasone. Pectin, gellan gum and sodium hyaluronate were used as gelling/thickening agents, and Tween 80 as a suspending agent. The influence of the formulation and/or administration parameters on formulation sprayability and nasal deposition was explored with an appropriate experimental design with the range for parameters in the design obtained from previous research and domain knowledge. All formulations exhibited appropriate sprayability and instant gelation upon mixing with simulated nasal fluid exhibiting weak gel properties convenient for nasal delivery. Targeted turbinate deposition depended on administration and formulation parameters, including their interactions. Decrease in the administration angle from horizontal plane, increase in inspiratory flow and presence of sodium hyaluronate significantly increased deposition in turbinate region. Parameters in interactions included concentration of polymers, surfactant and fluticasone, as well as administration angle. Selected formulations with high turbinate deposition exhibited significant increase in viscosity upon gelation, showing potential to prolong the drug retention at the nasal mucosa. The highest effect on the gel viscosity, strength and fluticasone release profile was observed for gellan gum, thus recognised as crucial parameter for the optimisation of overall therapeutic effect.

AB In present study, monodisperse photoresponsive hollow-shell structured molecularly imprinted polymers (PHSMIPs) were fabricated based on surface imprinting technique and first proposed for selective recognition and adsorption of alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CD) from complex samples. The structure and the binding properties of PHSMIPs and photoresponsive surface molecularly imprinted polymers (PSMIPs) were compared. Results showed the average diameter of PHSMIPs were about 480 nm with an approximately 40 nm shell. PHSMIPs possessed BET surface areas of 273.4 m(2)/g, the pore volume of 0.333 cm(3)/g, and average pore diameters of 4.3 nm. PHSMIPs displayed higher binding capacity, better recognition ability, and faster mass transfer rate toward alpha-CD than PSMIPs. Furthermore, PHSMIPs was successfully used in the separation of alpha-CD in real reaction solution, indicating potential application for purification and selective extraction of alpha-CD from complex environment.

AB This study attempted to improve Robusta sensory properties by modifying the beans chemical composition. Building on our previous work, which modified bean pH through acid pre-treatment, a model system was developed where, sugar solutions (glucose, fructose, sucrose) were used to pre-treat Robusta coffee beans with the aim to modify the concentration/availability/location of these aroma precursors. Beans were then dried to equal water activity, subjected to equal roast intensity and ground to comparable particle size distributions. The treatment significantly impacted aroma generation during roasting leading to an altered level of pyrazines, furans, ketones, organic acid and heterocyclic nitrogen-containing compounds (p < 0.05). The optimum treatment was 15 g/100 g fructose. 80% treated Robusta could be blended with Arabica in coffee brew without significant aroma differences being perceived when compared to 100% Arabica brew. Furthermore the aroma of the fructose treated Robusta was more stable than Arabica over six weeks accelerated shelflife storage.

AB In this study, rice glutelin isolated from glutinous rice was modified by sodium tripolyphosphate at different sodium tripolyphosphate concentrations (1%, 4%, 7%). The structural, functional and rheological properties of phosphorylated rice glutelin were investigated. The results indicated that phosphorylated rice glutelin samples showed small particle size and high absolute zeta potential values. Phosphorylation reaction was occurred between -OH and -NH2 groups in rice glutelin and sodium tripolyphosphate, as confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The particle surface of phosphorylated rice glutelin samples became very rough and exhibited some small convex and concave holes. Moreover, the solubility, emulsifying and foaming properties, thermal stability and apparent viscosity of phosphorylated rice glutelin samples were significantly increased. These results suggest that the solubility, emulsification and rheological properties of rice glutelin are significantly improved after phosphorylation, which will be beneficial to expand the application of rice glutelin in food industry.

AB Anthraquinones, a class of naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds, exhibit a wide range of bioactivities. However, most free anthraquinones are lipophilic bioactive compounds. Bovine beta-lactoglobulin (beta LG), a major whey protein, has a high affinity for small hydrophobic compounds. In this study, the interactions between anthraquinones (rhein, emodin, and chrysophanol) and beta LG were investigated by using fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and docking studies. These anthraquinones bound to the site near Trp19-Arg124 on beta LG with a binding constant (Ka) between 10(3) and 10(5) L mol(-1) to form complexes, which changed the secondary structure of beta LG, inducing an alpha-helix to beta-sheet structure transition. The order of binding increased with an increasing polarity in the order of rhein > emodin > chrysophanol. In addition, the degree of radical scavenging capacity masking increased with an increasing binding affinity. Complexation with beta LG significantly increases the hydrosolubility of anthraquinones.

AB D-Psicose/allulose is a rare sugar and it has high potential benefits for pharmaceutical and food industry. The existed analytical methods have its own limitations to quantify fructose and D-psicose mixtures. Hence there is a need for the development of an effective, efficient and sensitive analytical method for quantification of D-psicose in presence of other sugars. Quantification of sugars by capillary electrophoresis (CE) have been previously reported. However, the list does not include D-psicose. In this study, D-psicose is successfully quantified for the first time in the presence of D-fructose and glucose with a good resolution. Standard curves for all the sugars are established in a concentration range of 0.1mM (0.0018% w/v) to 3.0 mM (0.0540% w/v) with a coefficient of determination of > 0.99. The scope of this method can be extended to quantify D-psicose and their processed impurities in food products with minor modifications in sample preparation.

AB To determine organic mercury (Hg) species that could not be detected by ultraviolet (UV), a highly automated on-line complexation method was established, which combined with normal stacking by capillary electrophoresis-diode array detector. The approach was based on the fact that the compounds and complex reagent interacted to form hydrophilic chelates under the effect of the separation voltage, which was effectively separated and detected by UV. Key parameters, such as the type and concentration of complex reagent, separation voltage and so on were systematically investigated. Under the optimized conditions, the precision and repeatability were in the range of 0.16-3.31% and 0.17-1.21%, respectively. Furthermore, PhHg, EtHg and MeHg were effectively separated and determined in fresh fish (Silver carp) muscle and kelp (Kombu) with the recoveries of 84.63-111.39% and 75.68-114.76%, respectively. The proposed method had the advantages of easy-operating, cost-efficient, stable and reliable compared to off-line complexation method.

   PERCEPTION
AB This work presents a headspace-solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) method for the analysis of solid food samples in extended experiments. The final procedure was used to quantify 30 volatile compounds in fresh beef. The strategy adds robustness to the classic SPME methods for solid samples, by including a control solution that solves several challenges. The control solution contained one representative compound for each studied family of beef, and two internal standards. Response factors were calculated for each family, and were subsequently applied to every compound belonging to the same family. This strategy allowed control of the quantification procedure even when the fibre, column or control solution changed. Repeatability and reproducibility had relative standard deviation values below 17%, except for phenylacetaldehyde, (E)-2-nonenal and (E,Z)-2,4-decadienal. Although the method described here was applied to animal products, it has also been successfully used to distinguish between samples from different lipid oxidation stabilities.

ID LABEL-FREE DETECTION; MILK; SULFONAMIDES; RESIDUES
AB A photonic crystal (PC) sensor was prepared through molecular imprinting by using dispersed SiO2 microspheres as PC, sulfaguanidine (SG) as template, methacrylic acid as monomer, and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as crosslinker. The preparation conditions were optimized as follows: molar ratio of template, monomer, and crosslinker was 1:10:4; pH was 6.0 in phosphate buffer; and volume fraction of methanol was 15%. The relationship between wavelength shift of reflection peak and SG concentration was found as: Delta lambda= 7.8887 lg (C) + 79.9664. The response time was only 5 min. The limit of detection was 2.8 x 10(-10) mol L-1. The sensor exhibited higher specificity for SG than its sulfonamide analogs. The sensor maintained original sensing performance after five cycles of usage. The recoveries of SG ranged from 93.8% to 111.2% in lake water and from 88.5% to 115.2% in fish samples. This finding suggested that the sensor can be used in food samples with complicated matrix.

ID FATTY-ACID PROFILE; QUALITY; PEANUT; CHEMISTRY; SAMPLES
AB Protein extraction from goat meat was carried out based on the combination of response surface methodology and factorial design to optimize the variables: temperature (25-50 degrees C), extraction time (8-20 min), volume (3-10 mL) and extractor concentration (0.05-0.1 mol L-1). The proposed model did not present a lack of fit, explaining 96% of the total data variance (R-2 = 0.96). The optimum extraction conditions were: 0.05 mol L-1 for extractor concentration, extraction time of 10 min, temperature of 44 degrees C and extractor volume of 3.5 mL. The protein content (19.3 g/100 g) obtained by the optimized method was higher than some results reported in the literature. HPLC-SEC-DAD analysis revealed that the extraction conditions used did not significantly modify the protein structure. The proposed method proves to be simple, fast, robust, cheap and adequate for native protein extraction, being a potential approach for proteomic research focusing in goat meat.

AB This paper describes a robust multivariate model for quantifying and characterizing blends of Robusta and Arabica coffees. At different degrees of roasting, 120 ground coffee blends (0.0-33.0%) were formulated. Spectra were obtained by two different techniques, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and paper spray mass spectrometry (PS-MS). Partial least squares (PLS) models were built individually with the two types of spectra. Nevertheless, better predictions were obtained by low and medium-level data fusion, taking advantage from the synergy between these two data sets. Data fusion models were improved by variable selection, using genetic algorithms (GA) and ordered predictors selection (OPS). The smallest prediction errors were provided by OPS low-level data fusion model. The number of variables used for regression was reduced from 2145 (full spectra) to 230. Model interpretation was performed by assigning some of the selected variables to specific coffee components, such as trigonelline and chlorogenic acids.

AB This study's aim is to establish a new sensory sweetness definition and conversion method for five sugars. A "closed-type" question based on triangle test and paired comparison was used for sensory evaluation. The absolute threshold and nine sensory difference threshold values were determined and used to generate a sweet sensory difference strength curve. Defining absolute threshold of sucrose sweetness as 1, the sucrose sweetness at any concentration could be calculated via the curve. After taking the logarithm of each curve, sweetness index was calculated as 1, 1.12, 0.94, 1.29, and 1.25 for sucrose, glucose, fructose, lactose and maltose, respectively. Based on this, each sugar concentration and sweetness could be converted and calculated. Single sugar and mixed-sugars sweetness comparison experiments verified the new sweetness index and sweetness values were more accurate (83.3-100%) than those reported in previous studies. Therefore, this new definition and conversion method established more reliable references for sweet taste sensory applications.

AB Fipronil is a highly toxic insecticide, and fipronil egg scandal greatly threaten people's health. Herein, a precise and reliable method was developed for the determination of fipronil and three metabolites in chicken egg by GC-EI-MS. Sample pretreatment took about 20 min and baseline separation of four analytes were realized within 12 min by GC-MS. Moreover, the limits of detection were 0.2-0.5 ng g(-1) and the limits of quantitation was 0.5-1 ng g(-1) with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower that 3.32%. Satisfactory recoveries were get in the range of 81.16-103.57% for three levels of spiked samples. Finally, the developed method has been applied for the analysis of egg samples from four sources. Results showed that fipronil and fipronil-sulfone were detected in three samples, while fipronil-desulfinyl and fipronil-sulfide were totally absent. The method showed great promising in quantification of fipronil and its metabolites in food safety affairs.

AB Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157: H7) is a potential threat to human health; thus, a rapid and sensitive method for detecting it is necessary. We designed a single-stranded DNA that contained an appended block and anchoring block. The appended block acted as a scaffold to prepare fluorescent Ag nanoclusters (AgNCs). The anchoring block contained Poly A, which bound with the surface of gold nanoparticles to quench the fluorescence of AgNCs. An interesting ELISA approach for detecting E. coli O157:H7 was established via fluorescent quenching of DNA-stabilized AgNCs by using a sandwich complex. The changes in fluorescence intensity of AgNCs were used to quantitatively detect E. coli O157:H7. The sensitivity for detecting E. coli O157: H7 reached 1.905 x 10(3) CFU/mL with a good linear range. Compared with conventional ELISA, the sensitivity of this technique increased by 30-fold. Moreover, this method demonstrated specificity and reproducibility and could be used in food samples.

AB For the first time, thinned young kiwifruits (TYK) have been investigated as a source of deserted agriculture resource and evaluated for their phenolic characteristics along with antioxidant capacity. Two batches of TYK in different maturity stages (TYK1 and TYK2) and mature kiwifruits (MK) were sourced from three New Zealand cultivars. Comparing with MK, the TYK, especially TYK1, exhibited significantly higher contents of total phenolics (7.92 fold), total flavonoids (17.56 fold) and total flavanols (10.11 fold) as well as elevated and phenoliccorrelated antioxidant capacities. A novel UPLC-QqQ-MS/MS method with low limit of detection (0.010-0.240 mg/L) and high accuracy (RSDs < 6.79%) was established to quantify 15 phenolics in the kiwifruit extracts. Epicatechin was the prevailing antioxidant in both TKY and MK, with the highest level of 2989.23 mu g/g FDW present in TYK1 of 'Zesy002' cultivar. These results provide good evidence for the development and utilization of TYK of these cultivars in food and nutraceuticals.

AB Melanoidins formed from different carbohydrates, such as D-glucose, D-fructose, and D-xylose, and their typical degradation products, such as hydroxymethylfurfural, furfural, glyoxal, and methylglyoxal, with L-alanine were analyzed with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Characteristic infrared bands were identified representing spectral differences between the investigated melanoidin species due to their different molecular compositions. With the help of principal components analysis (PCA) the IR data allowed for a fast discrimination between the different model melanoidins. From this study it is inferred that the intensity and relative absorption wavelength of C-O single versus C=O double bonds are characteristic features of the investigated melanoidins. Melanoidins formed from carbohydrates exhibit less carbonyl functions in comparison to melanoidins from the degradation products, the situation is opposite for the C-O bond. The amount of C=O is additionally correlated with a higher absorption at 420 nm indicating that strong colored melanoidins contain more carbonyl functions.

AB Crude extracts were prepared from residues of Rubus glaucus Benth by using food-grade solvents. Their efficacy protecting lipid oxidation of an oil in water (O/W) emulsion as well as of a bulk oil was tested. Stability of lipids during storage of an O/W emulsion was tested by the hydroperoxides and thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) measurements. Bulk oil stability was measured by the Rancimat method. Fruit pomace crude extracts were the best controlling lipid oxidation of an O/W emulsion, with crude extracts from overripe fruit and bush pruning residues acting as pro-oxidants as measured by the hydroperoxides levels. Neither of the crude extracts was able to inhibit lipid oxidation of the bulk oil. Mathematical modelling revealed that despite total phenolic content and partition coefficient of the crude extracts are important parameters to control lipid oxidation of an O/W emulsion, they do not totally explain their behavior in food-like systems.

AB Insects are rich in major nutrients, such as protein and fat. Recently, minor nutrients like vitamins have become the subjects of interest in insects. Hence, this study reports on the development and validation of a method for the determination of vitamin B-12 in mealworm (Tenebrio molitor larvae), cricket (Gryllus assimilis), grasshopper (Locusta migratoria) and cockroach (Shelfordella lateralis), using an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography approach with preliminary immunoaffinity chromatography sample preparation. The method was validated regarding linearity, specificity, accuracy and precision, as well as limits of detection/quantification, and was found to be satisfactory for the desired application. Found levels of vitamin B-12 were 1.08 mu g/100 g for mealworm, 2.88 mu g/100 g for cricket, 0.84 mu g/100 g for grasshopper, and 13.2 mu g/100 g dry weight for cockroach, representing the first validated report on the content of vitamin B-12 in edible insects. Observed interferences are likely caused by the presence of pseudovitamin B-12.

AB The effect of processing on allergenicity of peanut, a major allergic food remains uncertainty. To discover the influence of thermal processing, extraction and assessment methods on potential allergenicity, protein was extracted by three methods or digested in the form of defatted peanut powder (DPP). The components of extracted allergens were analyzed using electrophoresis and mass spectrometry; the advanced structures (the secondary structure and the tertiary structure) were characterized through spectroscopies; the potential allergenicities were assessed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Biolayer interferometry (BLI) and KU812 cell degranulation assay. Results demonstrated that extraction influenced the allergenicity assessment significantly, and the assessment method was also important. The potential allergenicity of protein changed after processing, it increased after roasting, while decreased after boiling. Additionally, digested DPP combined with basophilic granulocyte degranulation model might be a good allergenicity assessment method.

AB For simultaneous determination of lignans (i.e. sesamin, sesamolin and sesamol) in sesame oils, a highly efficient ultrasonic-assisted liquid-liquid microextraction (UALLME) technique was developed based on deep eutectic solvents (DESs) composed of choline chloride and p-cresol. Compared with the common polyols-based DESs (i.e. choline chloride-ethylene glycol), the phenolic DESs exhibited higher extraction efficiency for both polar lignans (i.e. sesamol) and non-polar lignans (i.e. sesamin and sesamolin) due to the p-p interaction between lignans and DES. After the UALLME process, DES phase was analyzed by HPLC-UV. Under optimized condition, all three lignans showed good linear calibration curves and low limit of detection. The recoveries were in the range of 97.3-120%, and the intra-day and inter-day precisions were less than 0.97%. Moreover, this method was used for simultaneous determination of lignans in 15 commercial oil samples. The results showed that the new microextraction technique achieved similar efficiency as the conventional liquid-liquid extraction method.

AB The aim of this study was to determine the possibility of the use of Cornelian cherry (CC) juices in brewing technology. We analyzed basic physicochemical properties, concentration of polyphenols and iridoids, and antioxidative activity of brewed beer. The concentration of total polyphenols (F-C) in CC beer ranged from 398.1 to 688.7 mg GAE/L beer. The antioxidative activity measured with the DPPH% and FRAP assays was the highest in the beer with the addition of juice from red-fruit CC cultivar. Among the identified iridoids, loganic acid was the predominating compounds and its highest concentration, accounting for 184.6 mg LA/L beer, was found in the beer with juice made of coral-fruit CC cultivar. The identified polyphenols included anthocyanins and flavonol derivatives. The novelty of this study was to brewed beers containing compounds from the group of iridoids.

AB Three phenolic-rich legume varieties underwent in vitro simulated gastrointestinal proteolytic digestion after a wide range of thermal treatments. Total phenolic content (TPC), DPPH free radical scavenging activity (DPPH), degree of hydrolysis (DH), angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of hydrolysates showed significant differences among thermal treatments. TPC values of hydrolysates were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than their corresponding undigested counterparts. The DPPH values were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than their corresponding undigested counterparts. DH had no correlations (p > 0.05) with ACE inhibitory activity for all three legumes. When compared with undigested legumes, the simulated gastrointestinal tract proteolytic digestion induced marked changes not only in the content, but also in the type of individual free phenolic acids. The present study clearly implied that literature data of phenolics and their potential health benefits derived from undigested legumes cannot accurately represent the real situations after the digestion process.

AB Glucose oxidase (Gox) has many applications in numerous industries. However, thermal instability is a major drawback that prevents its broader use. Here, Gox from Aspergillus niger (GoxA) was selected for laboratory evolution for purposes of enhancing thermostability and catalytic efficiency through random and rational mutagenesis. The most active mutant, M4, accumulated six amino acid substitutions. The T-50 of M4, the temperature corresponding to a 50% loss of maximal enzyme activity, increased by 7.5 degrees C and thermal inactivation half-lives (t(1/2)) at 60 degrees C and 70 degrees C increased 8.4-fold and 5.6-fold, respectively, compared to wild-type GoxA. Concomitantly, M4 demonstrated a 1.86-fold increase in k(cat), resulting in a 1.78-fold increase in catalytic efficiency. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed diverse mechanisms underlying the effects of each mutation on thermostability and catalytic efficiency. These results suggest that key properties of glucose oxidase can be modified in vitro by laboratory evolution, which may have remarkable economic importance.

AB Double (W1/O/W2) emulsions of 0.8 %wt PGPR-0.25 %wt BC-1 %wt WPI and NaCl (1.6-8 %wt) were characterized regarding their microstructure, droplet size, stability and viscosity. Droplet size increased with salt concentration. Salt addition at 4-5 %wt limited the instability rate. Viscosity increased with NaCl concentration up to 4.8 %wt, above which it decreased. Eventually, the emulsion with 4.3 %wt salt was selected for catechin incorporation. In order to increase its antioxidant activity, Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG) was esterified with stearic acid. Esterification was partial and a mixture of esters was obtained. Both EGCG and its esterified derivatives were incorporated in the double emulsion. Storage reduced encapsulation. Encapsulation efficiency was reduced in the order "EGCG in the W1 phase" emulsion > "EGCG in the O phase" emulsion > "esterified EGCG in the W1 phase" emulsion. The presence of both catechins did not have a great effect on retarding emulsion oxidation.

AB Brazilian native fruits (BNF) remain unexplored and underutilized resources with a high potential to improve human health and wellness. In our study, five new BNF (Eugenia stipitata, Sageretia elegans, Byrsonima arthropoda, Spondias mombin and Rubus rosaefolius) were evaluated for their phenolic composition by LC-ESI-QTOF-MS; and for their ROS and RNS scavenging effects (ROO center dot, O-2(center dot-), NO center dot, HOCl); in vivo anti-inflammatory activity (neutrophil migration); and in vivo acute toxicity in Galleria mellonella. Eighty-six phenolic compounds were identified, including hydroxybenzoic acids, hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonoids, anthocyanins and ellagitannins, several of which had never been reported in BNF. The BNF exhibited high antioxidant effects against biologically relevant radicals, and treated animals showed decreased neutrophil influx and NF-kB activation. Thus, these BNF are good sources of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory molecules that can be beneficial for human health as functional foods. Based on their bioactivity, they can be considered as new Brazilian superfruits.

AB Anthocyanin-rich fractions isolated from blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum L.) including delphinidin-3-O-glucoside, delphinidin-3-O-rutinoside, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside were enzymatically acylated with lauric acid. All the four anthocyanins were successfully monoacylated, and their relative proportions did not affect the conversion yield. The acylation occurred at the 6''-OH position of the glucosides and at the rhamnose 4'''-OH of the rutinosides. The rutinoside moieties of the anthocyanins were successfully acylated for the first time, and the corresponding acylation sites were verified by NMR analysis. The acylation enhanced the lipophilicity. The hydrophilic anthocyanin rutinosides were more lipophilic after acylation. Introducing lauric acid into the anthocyanins significantly improved the thermostability and capacity to inhibit lipid peroxidation and maintained UV-vis absorbance and antioxidant activity. This research provides important insights into acylation of mixed anthocyanins with different glycosyl moieties.

AB Aspartic proteases are promising fining agents used in the production of fruit juices. In this study, a novel aspartic protease gene (Tlap) was identified in Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802 and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris. Using casein as the substrate, purified recombinant TlAP showed optimal activities at pH 3.0 and 55 degrees C with a specific activity of 1795.4 +/- 62.8 U/mg, and remained stable over a pH range of 3.0-6.0 and at temperatures of 45 degrees C and below. Moreover, the enzyme was highly resistant to most metal ions and chemical reagents except for Fe3+ and beta-mercaptoethanol. When added to apple, orange, grape and kiwi fruit juice, it showed excellent proteolytic activity against haze-forming proteins, decreasing the turbidity by up to 49.9 nephelometry turbidity units (NTU). These favorable enzymatic properties make TlAP attractive for potential use in the juice industry.

AB Spray drying is a fast and low-cost method of drying lactic acid bacteria, but it features a low survival rate. A pretreatment was designed to increase the survival by embedding bacteria in basic or acidic proteins with the principle of opposite charges attraction. Transglutaminase (TGase)-induced cross-linking then tightened the cell-protein complexes. The results showed that mixing of basic proteins with acidic proteins and TGase treatment increased the survival rates of spray-dried Lactobacillus bulgaricus sp1.1. 84.78% of cells in the TGase-treated milk basic protein (MBP)-soy protein isolate (SPI) bacterial solution remained after drying. Positively charged MBP adhered to more bacteria (negative charge) and formed tight closed loop-shaped complexes with SPI (negative charge) by electrostatic attraction, and TGase enhanced this attraction by strengthening of the hydrogen, C=O and C-N bonds and exposing the inner a-helix. Imbedding bacteria in TGase-treated acid-ic-basic protein can increase efficiency of the current formulation.

AB Oxidative deterioration is one of the most important factors limiting shelf-life of fatty food products, where the use of active packaging produced with natural antioxidants is a strategy to minimize these reactions. Poly(acid lactic) (PLA) films were produced with carotenoids extracts rich in beta-carotene, lycopene, and bixin. The kinetics of carotenoids' release to a fat simulant was evaluated and successfully explained by a new mathematical release model which considered the degradation of the migrants after their release. In the presence of light, films with lycopene and beta-carotene protected sunflower oil mainly by their light barrier properties, and secondly by their barrier to oxygen and antioxidant gradual releasing. The films produced with bixin presented the best performance as antioxidant active packaging to sunflower oil, where differences found in films barrier properties and in the transfer coefficients among the carotenoids were influenced by their molecular structures.

AB Catechins and methylxanthines are natural molecules in guarana (Paullinia cupana) that are associated with antioxidant and stimulatory effects in the human body. There are few natural sources of these antioxidants. The most popular molecule used in foods and beverages is caffeine, which, most of the time, is derived from synthetic sources. In this work, cold hydroalcoholic (CHM), hot hydroalcoholic (HHM), and aqueous enzymatic maceration (AEM) were applied to crude (CG) and waste guarana seeds (WG) to process these materials into natural added-value products with enhanced levels of catechin, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate, caffeine, theobromine and theophylline. The highest level of catechins and methylxanthines was extracted with HHM. Nevertheless, AEM enhanced the global yield in the extract, probably due to the solubilization of other substances. The maceration procedures applied to guarana contributed to the valorization of this plant crop by providing antioxidant sources with clear applications in food and nonfood industries.

AB The International Agency for Research on Cancer recently classified cured meats as carcinogenic for humans and red meats as probably carcinogenic. Mutagens can be formed during meat process or digestion. In a previous study, we used a dynamic artificial digestive system (DIDGI (R)) to investigate protein oxidation and N-nitrosation during bovine meat digestion. This new paper completes the previous one by focusing on the endogenous heme iron nitrosylation. Low nitrosylation due to nitrate initially present in meat and to ammonia oxidation in the stomach was observed in the digestive tract even in conditions in which no nitrite was added to the model. The endogenous addition of nitrite (1 mM) considerably increased heme iron nitrosylation while a significant decrease was observed with prior meat cooking (30 min at 60 and 90 degrees C).

AB A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method with selected ion monitoring (SIM) was developed and validated for identification and quantitative analysis of three phytosteryl esters, i.e., campesteryl oletate, stigmasteryl oletate and beta-sitosteryl oletate. The method is simple and efficient and achieved good separation of the three phytosteryl esters in 10 min without saponification and liquid-liquid extraction. A calibration curve for the three phytosteryl esters had a correlation coefficient (R-2) better than 0.993. Detection limits were 0.42 mg/mL for campesteryl oletate, 0.32 mg/mL for stigmasteryl oletate and 0.80 mg/mL for beta-sitosteryl oletate. The relative standard deviations (RSD) were within 5.47% for precision and stability for three edible oil samples. Recoveries were from 89.85% to 97.65% for each of the phytosteryl esters. These results suggest that the method can be used to identify and quantify the phytosteryl esters in oil samples.

AB Cyanidin-3-O-glucosylrutinoside and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside were isolated from sour cherry juice concentrate (SCJC). Sucrose and copigments [gallic acid (GA), cherry stem extract (CSE) and pomegranate rind extract (PRE)] were added to these anthocyanins. Effects of sucrose and copigments on the isolated anthocyanins were studied during storage at 20 degrees C for 140 days. All copigment sources provided protection against degradation effect of sucrose on the isolated anthocyanins before storage. Although GA increased the stabilities of both isolated anthocyanins, only CSE had copigmentation effect on both isolated anthocyanins. Copigmentation effect on cyanidin-3-O-glucosylrutinoside continued throughout storage. However, this effect on cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside continued for only 56 days of storage. Cyanidin-3-O-glucosylrutinoside containing three sugar moieties was more prone to copigmentation than cyanidine-3-rutinoside containing two sugar moieties. Results showed that the presence of more than one anthocyanin in a media changed stability of copigmentation. We recommend CSE for enhancement in colour density, but GA for enhancement in anthocyanin stability.

AB Lipid hydrolysis and oxidation occurred in Argopecten irradians adductor muscle during hot air drying. Using an in vivo imaging system, we found that antioxidants of bamboo leaves (AOB) could diffuse into the adductor muscle upon marinating. Both tea polyphenols (TP) and AOB efficiently retarded lipid oxidation but had a slight effect on lipid hydrolysis during drying process. The in situ antioxidant mechanisms of AOB as well as TP were revealed, including quenching of free radicals detected by electron spin resonance, chelating metal ions determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy and inhibiting lipoxygenase. Less than 8% of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in AOB and TP marinated adductor muscle were decreased compared to more than 28% decrease in control adductor muscle during the drying process. Overall, these natural antioxidants, TP and AOB, efficiently maintained high nutritive value of adductor muscle, especially, their lipid quality.

AB Green coffee extracted by pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) was found to undergo a roasting process similar to traditional roasting. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to investigate the chlorogenic acid (CGA) composition and profiling changes by PLE under different extraction conditions and showed almost identical generation and degradation of CGAs occurring during traditional coffee roasting. Compared with the traditional extraction of roasted coffee, optimized PLE coffee showed three- and two-fold higher antioxidant activity and total CGA contents, respectively.
   Composition diversity and the content of volatile compounds in PLE coffee were found to increase as the PLE temperature increased but were lower than those of traditionally roasted coffee. The sensory attributes of PLE coffee were also evaluated to have be associated with a profile change in the volatile compounds and nonvolatile CGA compounds.

The toxicity of arsenic greatly depends on its species, so the speciation analysis of arsenic is of critical importance. The aim of the present review is to highlight recent advances in arsenic speciation analysis in edible mushrooms. We summarized the contents and distribution of arsenic species in some edible mushrooms, the methods of sample preparation, and the techniques for their identification and quantification. Stability of the arsenic species during sample pretreatment and storage is also briefly discussed.

AB Yerba mate tea contains various biochemically active substances. However, it can contain toxic metals. Thus, this work reports the total concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb and Al in the commercial products, as well as the concentrations in infusions prepared. The bioaccessibility of these metals in these infusions was determined for the first time by in vitro digestion. For Al, its bioaccessibility was estimated in the presence of other ingredients used in tea consumption. In addition, the concentrations of phenolic compounds in infusions were also determined. All metals studied were detected in the samples ranging from 76 ng g(-1) (Cd) to 526 mu g g(-1) (Al). In general, Cd and Cu were the most bioaccessible metals, while Al was found in a relatively inert form. The addition of sugar and honey in infusions decreased the Al bioaccessibility. The relationship between the phenolic and the leaching of Al for the beverages was observed.

AB Holder pasteurization (62.5 degrees C, 30 min) of human milk denatures beneficial proteins. The present paper aimed to assess whether this can affect the kinetics of peptide release during digestion at the preterm stage. Raw (RHM) or pasteurized (PHM) human milk were digested in triplicates using an in vitro dynamic system. Mass spectrometry and multivariate statistics were conducted. Pre-proteolysis occurred mostly on beta-casein, for which cumulative peptide abundance was significantly greater in PHM over 28% of the hydrolysed sequence. Eight clusters resumed the kinetics of peptide release during digestion, which differed on seven clusters (69% of the 1134 peptides). Clusters associated to the heat-denaturated proteins, lactoferrin and bile salt-stimulated lipase, presented different kinetics of release during digestion, unlike that for beta-casein. Some bioactive peptides from beta-casein presented significant different abundances between PHM and RHM before digestion (1-18, 185-211) or in during intestinal digestion (154-160, 161-166). Further physiological consequences should be investigated.

AB In this research, the novel environmentally-friendly analytical method, Centrifuge-less deep eutectic solvent based magnetic nanofluid-linked air-agitated liquid-liquid microextraction (CL-DES-MNF-AALLME) coupled with ETAAS was proposed for simultaneous preconcentration of heavy metals of lead, arsenic, cadmium, and copper. In CL-DES-MNF-AALLME, the extraction solvent is novel magnetic nanofluid consists of DES based magnetic multiwall carbon nanotubes which can easily be separated from the media with no need to centrifugation. The detection limits of 4.2, 3, 3.5 and 3.6 ng L-1 were acquired for cadmium, lead, copper, and arsenic respectively. The proper closeness of enrichment factors in the range of 635-644.5 to preconcentration factor (640), confirm the quantitatively of the proposed extraction method with relative standard deviation of 2.5-3.1(%) (n= 7). The potential of the CL-DES-MNF-AALLME was considered in walnut, rice, tomato paste, spinach, orange juice, black tea, and water samples which showed high capability of the proposed method for application in the complex matrixes.

AB An efficient and specific liquid chromatography (LC)-based assay was developed to monitor the production of recombinant HIV-1 trimeric envelope glycoprotein (HIV Env trimer), a candidate vaccine for HIV-1 infection, in cell culture media to support scale-up process development. In this method, titer measurement was achieved by coupling a weak anion exchange chromatography (IEC) column with a size exclusion chromatography (SEC) column. This assay was specific, accurate, precise, and has been qualified for its intended purpose, with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 10 mu g/mL. This tandem separation strategy offered a reliable and timely analytical support to directly monitor the titer of HIV Env trimer during cell growth, without any extra sample purification steps.

AB Over the past decade, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has emerged as a major cause of mosquito-borne disease with transmission reported in over 100 countries worldwide. Although several strategies have been pursued for the development of a CHIKV vaccine, none has been approved yet. In this study, we describe the development of several vaccine vectors that express the structural proteins of the La Reunion CHIKV strain LR2006-OPY1. Protection from virus-induced pathologic changes was observed in vaccinated C57BL/6 mice, an important model for CHIKV vaccine development because of their ability to recapitulate several signs shown in infected humans. This study uniquely demonstrates the capacity of a mucosally-administered adenovirus vaccine to induce serum antibody responses and confer protective efficacy in a pre-clinical model. Our data provide further evidence in support of the clinical development of this oral Ad-CHIKV vaccine strategy in populations at high risk of contracting the disease. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Vaccination against measles has reduced disease, although measles virus antibody (MVAb) levels are lower after vaccination than natural infection. lmmunoglobulin (IG) preparations thus contain decreasing MVAb titers. US IG lot release requires a minimum titer of MVAb, yet equivalent information is not available for other geographies. Using a measles virus neutralization assay, IG fractionated from US or EU plasma is shown to contain similar levels of MVAb always above US regulatory requirements, supportive of equivalent protection against MV infection. Thus, the dosage for post-exposure prophylaxis in the EU could be aligned with the US FDA's treatment recommendations. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The modular binding sites on the influenza A(H3N2) hemagglutinin protein are under significant pressure to acquire mutations in order to evade human antibody recognition. Analysis of these hemagglutinin epitopes in the strains circulating during 2017/18 and early 2018/19 identified the emergence of a new antigenic cluster that has grown from 4% of circulating strains to 11%. We regressed our module-based antigenic distance, p(epitope), with A(H3N2) vaccine effectiveness from recent studies conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (r(2) = 0.92), and we used this to estimate that the 2018/19 vaccines will protect against most circulating A(H3N2) strains. The pEpitope model is useful for A(H3N2) influenza vaccine virus selection and development, and it has the potential to aid national or regional regulatory authorities in making geographically localized decisions.

There are currently >98 known serotypes; the most burdensome are covered by current pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) such as PCV10 (Synflorix (R)) and (Prevnar 13 (R)) PCV13. However, at present no PCV is available on the National Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI) in Thailand.
   Methods: Here we report a systematic review of studies regarding pneumococci associated with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and non-IPD in Thailand. The NCBI PubMed database and Google Scholar were used to identify relevant papers published from 1st January 1990 to 21st August 2017. The quantitative analysis was reported as the distribution of serotypes across two age groups, <= 5 and >5years old, as these were the most commonly reported. Where age was not stated, or data was combined, data were categorised as all ages.
   Results: The search returned 15 relevant articles. From these the five most common disease-causing serotypes, in rank order, were 6B, 23F, 14, 19A and 19F. Vaccine coverage would be 55.3% for PCV10 and 69.7% for PCV13. There was insufficient data to draw conclusions regarding non-invasive disease-causing pneumococcal serotypes.
   Conclusion: This review demonstrates that the serotypes which were most responsible for disease in Thailand are included in PCV10 and PCV13. Better surveillance data of IPD and non-IPD are required for monitoring vaccine effectiveness if PCV is implemented nationally. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In conjugate, inactivated, recombinant, and toxoid vaccines, adjuvants are extensively and essentially used for enhanced and long-lasting protective immune responses. Depending on the type of diseases and immune responses required, adjuvants with different design strategies are developed. With aluminum salt-based adjuvants as the most used ones in commercial vaccines, other limited adjuvants, e.g., AS01, AS03, AS04, CpG ODN, and MF59, are used in FDA-approved vaccines for human use. In this paper, we review the uses of different adjuvants in vaccines including the ones used in FDA-approved vaccines and vaccines under clinical investigations. We discuss how adjuvants with different formulations could affect the magnitude and quality of adaptive immune response for optimized protection against specific pathogens. We emphasize the molecular mechanisms of various adjuvants, with the aim to establish structure-activity relationships (SARs) for designing more effective and safer adjuvants for both preventative and therapeutic vaccines.

AB Introduction: Although a vaccine-preventable disease, influenza causes approximately 3-5 million cases of severe illness and about 290,000-650,000 deaths worldwide, which occur primarily among people 65 years and older. Nonetheless, prevention of influenza and its complications rely mainly on vaccination. We aimed to systematically evaluate influenza vaccine effectiveness at reducing healthcare utilization in older adults, defined as the reduction of outpatient visits, ILI and influenza hospitalizations, utilization of antibiotics and cardiovascular events by vaccination status during the influenza season.
   Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and considered any seasonal influenza vaccine, excluding the pandemic (2009-10 season) vaccine. Reviewers independently assessed data extraction and quality assessment.
   Results: Of the 8308 citations retrieved, 22 studies were included in the systematic review. Overall, two studies (9%) were deemed at moderate risk of bias, thirteen (59%) at serious risk of bias and seven (32%) at critical risk of bias. For outpatient visits, we found modest evidence of protection by the influenza vaccine. For all-cause hospitalization outcomes, we found a wide range of results, mostly deemed at serious risk of bias. The included studies suggested that the vaccine may protect older adults against influenza hospitalizations and cardiovascular events. No article meeting our inclusion criteria explored the use of antibiotics and ILI hospitalizations. The high heterogeneity between studies hindered the aggregation of data into a meta-analysis.
   Conclusion: The variability between studies prevented us from drawing a clear conclusion on the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine on healthcare utilization in older adults. Overall, the data suggests that the vaccine may result in a reduction of healthcare utilization in the older population. Further studies of higher quality are necessary. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

AB The development of a group B Streptococcus (GBS) vaccine for maternal immunization constitutes a global public health priority, to prevent GBS-associated early life invasive disease, stillbirth, premature birth, maternal sepsis, adverse neurodevelopmental consequences, and to reduce perinatal antibiotic use. Sample size requirements for the conduct of a randomized placebo-controlled trial to assess vaccine efficacy against the most relevant clinical endpoints, under conditions of appropriate ethical standards of care, constitute a significant obstacle on the pathway to vaccine availability. Alternatively, indirect evidence of protection based on immunologic data from vaccine and sero-epidemiological studies, complemented by data from opsonophagocytic in vitro assays and animal models, could be considered as pivotal data for licensure, with subsequent confirmation of effectiveness against disease outcomes in post-licensure evaluations. Based on discussions initiated by the World Health Organization we present key considerations about the potential role of correlates of protection towards an accelerated pathway for GBS vaccine licensure and wide scale use. Priority activities to support progress to regulatory and policy decision are outlined. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the USA with some strains increasing the risk of certain cancers. The HPV vaccine, introduced in 2006, has reduced the infection rate, although racial/ethnic disparities in vaccination exist. Asian college students are among those with the lowest vaccination rates, however there has been little exploration as to why. The purposes of this study were to assess (a) knowledge and attitudes regarding HPV and its vaccine, (b) HPV vaccination practices, and (c) factors associated with HPV-related knowledge and attitudes, and vaccination among Chinese college students in the USA. This cross-sectional quantitative survey collected data face-to-face and online from 449 participants. The mean scores for HPV knowledge and attitudes were 40.87 and 2.36 indicating a low-to-moderate level of knowledge but a moderately positive attitude regrading HPV transmission and vaccination. Only half (50.8%) knew that the vaccination could be received after the age of 18 years. Only 38.3% reported having receiving at least one dose of the vaccine, with 92.4% receiving their first HPV vaccines in the USA. Multiple logistic regression showed that men and non-health sciences majors had lower knowledge about HPV. Older students, those without a primary care provider, and those who completed the survey in English had more negative attitudes about the HPV and vaccine. Participants who were younger, female, had a higher level of knowledge, had more positive attitudes, and completed the survey online were associated with better vaccination status. Findings from this study provide insight into Chinese college students' knowledge and attitudes about HPV and HPV vaccination and may be used to develop culturally sensitive programs that address the risk of HPV and the benefits of HPV vaccine.

AB Vaccination is the primary preventative measure against outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). The efficacy of inactivated FMD vaccines is mainly determined by the integrity of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) particles (referred to as 146S particles), and impurities in the inactivated vaccines could result in side effects. In this study, we developed an effective affinity purification method for the purification of FMDV from cellular lysates, referred to as GEM-PA-nanotrap. To develop the GEM-PA-nanotrap, a nanobody (Nb205) against FMDV vaccine strain O/MYA98/BY/2010 146S particles was selected from a non-immunized library and fused to a peptidoglycan-binding protein anchor (PA). The PA-Nb205 fusion protein was non-covalently coupled to the surface of Gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particles, which were prepared from the non-living, non-genetically modified, Gram-positive, food-grade Lactococcus lactis bacteria. The GEM-PA-nanotrap was used to purify FMDV from cellular lysates through a simple incubation and centrifugation step. The FMDV recovery rate was more than 99%, the efficiency of nonviral protein removal was about 98.3%, and the purification process had almost no effect on the integrity and immunogenicity of 146S particles. Therefore, the GEM-PA-nanotrap has potential as an effective method for the recovery and purification of FMDV during the vaccine manufacturing process. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Yellow fever (YF) is a high-lethality viral disease, endemic in tropical regions of South America and Africa, with a population of over 900 million people under risk. A highly effective attenuated vaccine, produced in embryonated eggs, has been used for about 80 years. However, egg-based production limits manufacturing capacity, and vaccine shortage led to the emergency use of a fractional dose (1/5) by the WHO in an outbreak in Africa in 2016 and by Brazilian authorities during an outbreak in 2018. In addition, rare but fatal adverse events of this vaccine have been reported since 2001. These two aspects make clear the need for the development of a new vaccine. In an effort to develop an inactivated YF vaccine, Bio-Manguinhos/FIOCRUZ started developing a new vaccine based on the production of the attenuated 17DD virus in serum-free conditions in Vero cells propagated in bioreactors, followed by chromatography-based purification and beta-propiolactone inactivation.
   Virus purification was studied in this work. Capture was performed using an anion-exchange membrane adsorber (Sartobind (R) Q), resulting in a virus recovery of 80.2 +/- 4.8% and a residual DNA level of 1.3 +/- 1.6 ng/dose, thus in accordance with the recommendations of the WHO (<10 ng/dose). However, the level of host cell proteins (HCP) was still high for a human vaccine, so a second chromatography step was developed based on a multimodal resin (Capto (TM) Core 700). This step resulted in a virus recovery of 65.7 +/- 4.8% and decreased HCP levels to 345 +/- 25 ppm. The overall virus recovery in these chromatography steps was 52.7%. SDS-PAGE of the purified sample showed a band with molecular mass of 56 kDa, thus consistent with the virus envelope protein (E) and corresponding to 96.7% of identified proteins. A Western blot stained with an antibody against the E protein showed a single band, confirming the identity of the sample. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Leishmaniasis is a growing health problem in many parts of the world and efforts to find vaccine against the disease are a public health priority. Live attenuated vaccines are the gold standard for protection against intracellular pathogens such as Leishmania spp. Defined genetic alteration of the Leishmania genome can be achieved using a gene-targeted disruption strategy that allows for the selection of parasites lacking genes essential for long-term survival and virulence. Previously, we demonstrated that genetically modified live attenuated Leishmania major, lacking the p27gene (Lmp27(-/-)) is safe and induces cellular immunity in BALB/c mice. p27 is a component of the COX complex that is responsible for ATP synthesis. In the current study, the Lmp27(-/-) strain was assessed as a live attenuated vaccine. Overall protective immunity and efficacy were evaluated at various time periods following Leishmania major (L, major) and Leishmania infantum (L infantum) challenges separately in BALB/c mice. Cytokine and anti-Leishmania antibody levels, splenocyte proliferation, delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH), skin lesion development, and parasite burden in the liver and spleen were the measured variables. The results demonstrated that immunized mice had a significant T-helper type 1 (Th1) response, smaller skin lesions and lower parasite burdens in their liver and spleens following a L major challenge. Furthermore, the Lmp27(-/-) mutant also granted cross-protection against L. infantum infection.
   These results suggest that immunization with Lmp27(-/-) parasites provide significant protective immunity and efficacy against infection with homologous as well as heterologous species of Leishmania parasites. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effect of propensity of seeking medical care on the bias of the
   estimated effectiveness of rotavirus vaccines from studies using a
   test-negative case-control design
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Rotavirus vaccines; Test-negative design; Vaccine effectiveness;
   Confounding bias; Selection bias; Probability models
AB Background: Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe diarrhea among children worldwide, and vaccines can reduce morbidity and mortality by 50-98%. The test-negative control (TNC) study design is increasingly used for evaluating the effectiveness of vaccines against rotavirus and other vaccine-preventable diseases. In this study design, symptomatic patients who seek medical care are tested for the pathogen of interest. Those who test positive (negative) are classified as cases (controls).
   Methods: We use a probability model to evaluate the bias of estimates of rotavirus vaccine effectiveness (VE) against rotavirus diarrhea resulting in hospitalization in the presence of possible confounding and selection biases due to differences in the propensity of seeking medical care (PSMC) between vaccinated and unvaccinated children.
   Results: The TNC-based VE estimate corrects for confounding bias when the confounder's effects on the probabilities of rotavirus and non-rotavirus related hospitalizations are equal. If this condition is not met, then the estimated VE may be substantially biased. The bias is more severe in low-income countries, where VE is known to be lower. Under our model, differences in PSMC between vaccinated and unvaccinated children do not result in selection bias when the TNC study design is used.
   Conclusions: In practice, one can expect the association of PSMC (or other potential confounders) with the probabilities of rotavirus and non-rotavirus related hospitalization to be similar, in which case the confounding effects will only result in small bias in the VE estimate from TNC studies. The results of this work, along with those of our previous paper, confirm the TNC design can be expected to provide reliable estimates of rotavirus VE in both high- and low-income countries.

AB Leucine aminopeptidase (FhLAP) and cathepsin L1 (FhCL1) of Fasciola hepatica play a critical role in parasite feeding, migration through host tissue, and immune evasion. These antigens have been tested for immune protection as single components with variable degrees of success. The chimeric-protein approach could improve protection levels against fasciolosis. Previously, we reported the design and construction of a chimeric protein composed of antigenic sequences of FhLAP and FhCL1 of F. hepatica. The goal of the present study was to express and evaluate the immune-protective capacity of this chimeric protein (rFhLAP-CL1) in sheep. Animals were randomly allocated into five groups with five animals in each group. Groups 1, 2 and 3 were immunized twice with 100 mu g, 200 mu g and 400 mu g of rFhLAP-CL1 emulsified with Quil A adjuvant, whereas groups 4 and 5 were the adjuvant control and infection control groups, respectively. The animals were then challenged with 200 metacercariae two weeks after the rFhLAP-CL1 booster. The fluke burden was reduced by 25.5%, 30.7% (p < 0.05) and 46.5% (p < 0.01) in sheep immunized with 100 mu g, 200 mu g and 400 mu g of chimeric protein, respectively, in comparison to the infection control group. There was a reduction of 22.7% (p < 0.05) and 24.4% (p < 0.01) in fecal egg count in groups 2 and 3, respectively, compared to the infection control group. Sheep immunized with chimeric protein produced F. hepatica excretion-secretion product-specific total IgG antibody, which were increased after challenge. Moreover, the levels of rFhLAP-CL1-specific IgG1 and IgG2 isotypes in immunized sheep increased rapidly two weeks after the first immunization and were significantly more elevated than those of the control groups, indicating a mixed Thl/Th2 response. This is a preliminary evaluation of the chimeric protein rFhLAP-CL1 as a possible immunogen against F. hepatica infection in sheep. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a viral disease that can have a severe clinical course and considerable long-term morbidity. As no curative treatment exists, vaccination is the primary means of prevention. Long-term antibody seropersistence 2-5 years after the 3-dose primary immunization and 3-10 years after first booster was evaluated, as well as booster responses in children, adolescents and young adults.
   Methods: Subjects who participated in these phase 4 prospective, open-label follow-up studies received all vaccinations with FSME-IMMUN. After 3-dose primary immunization, subjects were followed for 25 years. Overall, 205 out of 358 subjects (57%) received the first booster and 179 of these subjects (87%) enrolled in a further 10-year follow-up. Antibody seropersistence was assessed annually. Subjects with a TBE antibody titer below a pre-specified cut-off at the yearly blood draw received a booster. Seropositivity rates and geometric mean fold rises (GMERs) were assessed.
   Results: In children who received their 3-dose primary immunization between 1 and 15 years of age, the seropositivity rate 5 years after the 3rd dose was 84.9% by NT and 72.0% by ELISA. One month post-first booster, all subjects were seropositive by NT and 98.5% by ELISA. Response to first booster by GMFR ranged from 3.7 to 11.4. At 5 years post-first booster, seropositivity was 99.4% by NT and 97.5% by ELISA, and at 10 years, was 90.3% by NT and 87.7% by ELISA. Although seropositivity rates differed between age groups, all subjects (100%) who received a second booster responded with a robust increase of TBEV antibodies.
   Discussion: Long-lasting seropersistence of TBEV antibodies after the 3-dose primary immunization and first booster was demonstrated as well as a competent immune memory response in those who received a first or second booster at any time during the 15-year follow-up. Therefore, an extension of FSME-IMMUN booster interval up to 10 years after the 3-dose primary immunization seems warranted. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although articular cartilage degeneration in osteoarthritis represents a major public health problem, there is still no molecular approach to prevent this pathology by blocking specific molecules. We have previously applied genome-wide expression analyses with porcine samples to identify specific markers of either growth plate or articular cartilage. Since the molecular differences were also found in cultured chondrocytes derived from both sites, we utilized primary porcine articular chondrocytes (PPACs) for the present study and analyzed, if and how they respond to synoviocyte-derived molecules. PPACs were treated by conditioned medium from porcine synovial fibroblasts (SF-CM) for 2, 6 and 24 h. Gene expression was subsequently monitored by qRT-PCR and microarray analysis. We found that short-term administration of SF-CM to PPACs significantly reduced expression of chondrocyte markers, while it induced expression of SDC4, encoding syndecan-4, a positive regulator of articular cartilage breakdown. Consistently, expression of MMP3, a putative downstream effector of syndecan4 was strongly induced by SF-CM in PPACs. We identified an MMP3-inducing fraction in the range of 40 kDa after gel filtration, and we confirmed our findings in three-dimensional PPAC cultures, where SF-CM also reduced the glycosaminoglycan content. Taken together, our data suggest that synovial fibroblasts secrete one or more molecule(s) that activate specific signaling events in articular chondrocytes. Identifying a responsible ligand receptor pair(s) might pave the way to develop molecular therapies to reduce the severity of osteoarthritis.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one type of the most common malignancies. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the development of HCC remain unknown. To identify the candidate genes in the progression of HCC, gene expression profiles GSE14520, GSE54236, GSE57957 and GSE64041 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO). A total of 405 tumor and 399 para-carcinoma samples from patients with HCC were examined to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by function enrichment analyses including Gene Ontology (GO) functions and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. A total of 78 DEGs were screened, including 62 downregulated genes and 16 upregulated genes. Subsequently, the protein-protein interaction network (PPI) was constructed using the Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database. The module analysis and Hub genes validation were performed using Cytoscape software. Hierarchical clustering of hub genes was evaluated using UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser. Survival analyses of Hub genes were performed using Kaplan Meier Plotter database. Genes specifically expressed in the liver were analyzed using GENEVESTIGATOR database. CYP2C8 was identified as one of the most promising molecules among all the candidate genes. The expression profile of CYP2C8 in HCC was analyzed using ONCOMINE and UALCAN database. The expression levels of CYP2C8 in HCC samples and hepatoma cells were verified using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry analysis. In summary, DEGs and hub genes were identified in the present study, which provides novel insight on the development of HCC. CYP2C8 was downregulated in HCC and could be a potential prognostic biomarker.

AB Adult stem cells are self-renewing populations that originate from embryonic progenitor cells during organogenesis and retain multipotency to support tissue and organ regeneration throughout the lifetime of an organism. The hair follicle (HF) is a small organ that is ideal for studying the biology and regulation of adult stem cells. A distinct, permanent pool of adult stem cells is located in the HF bulge region. Most methods used to isolate hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) begin with mouse or human follicles. Here, we describe two methods of isolating HFSCs from newborn Yangtze River Delta White Goats. A suitable method was found. The cell viability and expression of HFSC marker proteins differed in the two methods. CD49f-positive (integrin alpha 6) HFSCs were sorted by fluorescence activated flow cytometry. Sorted HFSCs can be used in various in vivo grafting models and are useful as an in vitro model to study multipotency, quiescence and activation.

AB Synbiotics are the bioactive compounds that synergistically combine effects of prebiotics and probiotics. In poultry, synbiotics can be used to reprogram animal's intestinal microbiota upon perinatal in ovo injection on day 12 of eggs incubation. Optimally composed synbiotic delivered in ovo efficiently stimulates the host's intestinal microflora, which in turn exerts beneficial effects on the host and improves its physiological functions. The aim of the study was to estimate long-term changes in the chicken transcriptome after a single in ovo administration of two different synbiotics. On day 12 of eggs incubation, 5850 eggs of broiler chicken were distributed to experimental groups and injected with synbiotic 1 (S1)- Lactobacillus salivarius with galactooligosaccharides (GOS) or synbiotic 2 (S2) Lactobacillus plantarum with raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFO). On day 21 post hatching cockerels were sacrificed and immunological (cecal tonsils and spleen), intestinal (jejunum) and metabolic (liver) tissues were collected (n = 5). Isolated RNA served as a template for the whole-transcriptome analysis using GeneChip Chicken Gene 1.1. ST Array Strip (Affymetrix). Data analysis was performed using Affymetrix Expression Console and Transcriptome Analysis Console software, Venn diagrams, DAVID and CateGOrizer. The highest number of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG) was detected in cecal tonsils (160 DEG) after S1 in ovo injection, and in liver (159 DEG) after S2 injection. The influence of S1 on transcriptome modulation was demonstrated by a strong activation of the genes taking part in the pathways related to metabolism and immune response in cecal tonsils. S2 injection led to modulation of the gene expression associated with metabolic and developmental signaling pathways in the liver. Obtained results let us conclude that synbiotics delivered in ovo have significant impact on chicken transcriptome and their effect depends on the composition of the bioactive compound.

AB MicroRNA-499 (miR-499) rs3746444 polymorphism has been associated with the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). However, results from several studies are inconsistent. This meta-analysis aimed to further investigate the possible association between miR-499 rs3746444 polymorphism and CHD risk. A total of 9 case-control studies included 5063 CHD cases and 4603 healthy subjects. The A allele at rs374644 was associated with significantly decreased CHD risk in the total population according to the allelic model (OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.68-0.93, P = 0.005), homozygous model (OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.39-0.71, P < 0.001) and heterozygous model (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.43-0.77, P < 0.001). A similar trend was found specifically in Asian and Chinese populations. In contrast, the wild-type GG genotype at rs374644 was associated with significantly increased CHD risk in the total population, according to the dominant model (OR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.39-2.42, P < 0.001), and a similar trend was found in Asian and Chinese populations. These results indicate that in the total population, as well as in Asian and Chinese populations, the wild-type GG genotype at rs374644 may be related to increased susceptibility to CHD, while the A allele may be protective against CHD.

AB Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a key role in several diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, HIV-associated neurological diseases (HAND), multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, certain viral infections of the central nervous system, cancer, and hepatitis C virus. MMPs have been explained with regards to extracellular matrix remodeling, which occurs throughout life and ranges from tissue morphogenesis to wound healing in various processes. MMP are inhibited by endogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Matrix metalloproteases act as an interface between host's attack by Tat protein of HIV-1 virus and extracellular matrix, which causes breaches in the endothelial barriers by degrading ECM. This process initiates the dissemination of virus in tissues which can lead to an increase HIV-1 infection. MMPs are diverse and are highly polymorphic in nature, hence associated with many diseases. The main objective of this review is to study the gene expression of MMPs in HIV-related diseases and whether TIMPs and MMPs could be related with disease progression, HIV vulnerability and HAND. In this review, a brief description on the classification, regulation of MMP and TIMP, the effect of different MMPs and TIMPs gene polymorphisms and its expression on HIV-associated diseases have been provided. Previous studies have shown that MMPs polymorphism (MMP-1, MMP-2 MMP3, and MMP9) plays an important role in HIV vulnerability, disease progression and HAND. Further research is required to explore their role in pathogenesis and therapeutic perspective.

AB Aim: We analysed multiple microarray datasets in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) DataSets for messenger RNAs (mRNAs) whose expression is apparently increased in human cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) samples, compared with that in the adjacent normal biliary epithelial tissue. The results revealed that the expression of tripartite motif-containing 59 (TRIM59) was significantly increased in the CCA tissue samples. TRIM59 is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family, which contains a highly conserved N-terminal an interesting new gene (RING) domain regulating transcriptional factors and tumorigenesis. In the present study, we investigated the effects of TRIM59 expression on tumour growth in CCA.
   Materials and methods: After analyzing the microarray datasets from the TCGA database and GEO DataSets, we screened out 291 target genes, which are significantly overexpressed in CCA tissues, and TRIM59 was one of them. The quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were performed to determine the expression of TRIM59 in CCA tissues (n = 65) and cell lines. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted to assess the prognosis of TRIM59 in patients with CCA. A specific siRNA (siRNA-1008) was used to inhibit the expression of TRIM59 in HCCC9810 and HUCCT1 cell lines. The effects of TRIM59 silencing on cell proliferation were assessed by the CCK-8, colony-formation, and EDU incorporation assays. Furthermore, the effects of TRIM59 knockdown on cell apoptosis and cell cycle were determined by flow cytometry. The in vivo effects were evaluated using a mouse tumorigenic model. Western blotting was also performed to verify the relationship between knockdown of TRIM59 and activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
   Results: TRIM59 was highly expressed in CCA tissues. The knockdown of TRIM59 obviously reduced the proliferation and colony formation abilities of CCA cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the cell apoptosis analysis results showed that TRIM59 silencing apparently promoted CCA cell apoptosis by the mitochondrial pathway. Our preliminary results indicate that the down-regulation of TRIM59 levels might restrict the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway.
   Conclusions: Our study revealed that TRIM59 is up-regulated in CCA tissues and cell lines and promoted CCA cell proliferation, possibly by affecting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway.

AB Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) family genes play important roles in regulating plant growth and abiotic stress response. Based on the sequenced Gossypium genomes, we performed comprehensive analysis of PEPC homolog genes in cotton, which six, six, eleven and ten PEPC genes were identified in Gossypium arboreum (A(2)), G. raimondii (D-5), G. hirsutum (AD(1)) and G. barbadense (AD(2)), respectively. These genes were divided into six subgroups: PEPC-i, PEPC-ii, PEPC-iii, PEPC-iv, PEPC-v and PEPC-vi; PEPC genes in each subgroup displayed conserved gene structure and motifs. Segmental duplication and whole genome duplication (WGD) events yielded the expansion of PEPC genes. Expression assays showed that the duplicated PEPC genes displayed diverse expression patterns, indicating that they experienced functional divergence. Of which, genes in PEPC-iv subgroup played crucial role for substrate distribution in cottonseed. Cis-elements, putative miRNAs and expression analyses showed that GhPEPC homologs might respond to abiotic stresses, expression levels of GhPEPC1 and GhPEPC2/GhPEPC2D genes were larger induced than other GhPEPC genes under cold, heat, salt, and drought stresses, indicating the crucial roles in abiotic stresses response. Present study serves new information to decipher the evolution and function of PEPC genes in Gossypium.

AB The edible sea urchin, Mesocentrotus nudus, is both an economically important mariculture species and an excellent model for studying reproductive development. The gonads are the only edible parts of sea urchins and increasing market demand for high-quality gonads has prompted increasing amounts of research into the molecular mechanisms of reproduction. Using a high-throughput sequencing technology, we performed transcriptome sequencing on the gonads of females and males, sampled before the spawning season, to identify genes involved in sex determination, sex differentiation and gametogenesis. Through a de novo transcriptome assembly approach, we obtained 104,039 unigenes, of which 40,471 (38.90%) showed homologies with known proteins in public databases. By comparing the expression levels of these unigenes in females and males, 15,368 differentially-expressed unigenes (DEGs) were identified. Compared with males, 9473 were up-regulated and 5895 were down-regulated in females. Multiple candidate genes were identified that may play important roles in spermatogenesis, oogenesis, and germ cell development. Furthermore, we identified and characterized several genes involved in sex determination and sex differentiation, such as dmrt1 and foxl2. The current study provides valuable molecular resources for studying the underlying mechanisms of reproduction in sea urchins.

AB Differential co-expression is a cutting-edge approach to analyze gene expression data and identify both shared and divergent expression patterns. The availability of high-throughput gene expression datasets and efficient computational approaches have unfolded the opportunity to a systems level understanding of functional genomics of different stresses with respect to plants. We performed the meta-analysis of the available microarray data for reoviridae and sequiviridae infection in rice with the aim to identify the shared gene co-expression profile. The microarray data were downloaded from ArrayExpress and analyzed through a modified Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) protocol. WGCNA clustered the genes based on the expression intensities across the samples followed by identification of modules, eigengenes, principal components, topology overlap, module membership and module preservation. The module preservation analysis identified 4 modules; salmon (638 genes), midnightblue (584 genes), lightcyan (686 genes) and red (562 genes), which are highly preserved in both the cases. The networks in case of reoviridae infection showed neatly packed clusters whereas, in sequiviridae, the clusters were loosely connected which is due to the differences in the correlation values. We also identified 83 common transcription factors targeting the hub genes from all the identified modules. This study provides a coherent view of the comparative aspect of the expression of common genes involved in different virus infections which may aid in the identification of novel targets and development of new intervention strategy against the virus.

AB Background: Metadherin (MTDH) is an oncogene that has been overexpressed in numerous types of malignancies including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, few investigations associated with the biological behavior of MTDH in CRC have been performed. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of modification of MTDH gene expression (knockdown and overexpression) on the biological behavior of CRC in vitro.
   Methods: MTDH gene expression was analyzed in two CRC cell lines (Caco-2 and HCT116) by qPCR. MTDH was down-regulated via siRNA-mediated knockdown of human MTDH in HCT116 cells, which express high endogenous levels of MTDH gene. Also, MTDH gene was up-regulated via transfection of Caco-2 cells, which express low endogenous levels of MTDH gene, with a plasmid carrying human MTDH gene.
   Results: Knockdown of MTDH gene expression significantly decreased the gene expression of multidrug resistance gene (MDR1), Snail and NF-kappa B p65, but increased the gene expression of E-cadherin. Furthermore, MTDH-knockdown significantly decreased anaerobic glycolysis (glucose consumption and lactate production), cell proliferation ability and transformation into cancer stem cell. Moreover, up-regulation of MTDH gene significantly increased the gene expression of MDR1, Snail and NF-kappa B p65, deceased the gene expression of E-cadherin, enhanced cell proliferation, and anaerobic glycolysis and activated transformation into cancer stem cells.
   Conclusions: MTDH has an important role in promoting CRC aggravation. Also, inhibition of MTDH expression may attenuate the carcinogenic behavior of CRC cells. Furthermore, MTDH-associated NF-kappa B p65 signaling pathways may be involved in mediating the biological behavior of CRC.

AB The knowledge of cancer cell response to conventional therapies is crucial in order to choose the correct therapy of patients affected by cancer. The major problem is generally attributed to the lack of specific biological processes able to predict the therapy efficacy. Here, we optimized a computational method for the analysis of gene networks able to detect and quantify the effects of a drug in a pan-cancer study. Overall, our method, using several network topological measures has identified a cancer gene network with a key role in biological processes. The gene network, able to classify with a good performance cancer vs normal samples, was modulated in silico to evaluate the effects of new or approved drugs. This computational model could offer an interesting hint to decipher molecular mechanisms contributing to resistance or inefficacy of drugs.

AB Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene is associated with increased risk of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and plays a role in neuroplasticity, cognition and memory. BDNF has strong potential as a therapeutic target as studies have shown that antidepressants, electroconvulsive treatment and exercise modulate BDNF expression and methylation. In this study we examined the role of BDNF methylation and expression in PTSD and the implications of exercise in mediating these effects.
   BDNF DNA methylation and gene expression analysis was performed in a sample of 96 male Vietnam veterans. Cases were combat-exposed veterans with current PTSD (n = 48) and controls were combat exposed veterans with no past or current PTSD diagnosis (n = 48).
   No association between BDNF mRNA and PTSD was identified. PTSD was associated with decreased methylation at three BDNF CpG sites (cg01546433 P = 0.004835; cg24650785 P = 0.000259 and cg002298481 P = 0.000672). Differential BDNF methylation was associated with exercise, with active exercise associated with lower methylation levels at three CpG sites (cg04481212 P = 0.005; cg01546433 P = 0.025 and cg00298481 P = 0.035). Given that exercise mediates BDNF action on cognitive plasticity, exercise may be a non-invasive, drug free option in the treatment of PTSD.

AB Ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins have been shown to be abnormally expressed in different cancers. To investigate the expression pattern of TET proteins in HepG2 cells, sodium ascorbate was used to treat HepG2 cells. Our results showed that TET1, TET2 and TET3 expression was increased after sodium ascorbate treatment. The TET proteins catalyze the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), thus, 5mC and 5hmC levels were examined. The results suggested that 5hmC was increased after sodium ascorbate treatment. To further determine the biological function of the TET proteins, si-TET1, si-TET2 and si-TET3 were transfected into HepG2 cells. The results showed that a knock down of TET3 expression stimulated cell proliferation of HepG2 cells. To further understand the effects of TET3 expression on cell proliferation, sodium ascorbate was added to the cells after transfection with si-TET3. The results demonstrated that sodium ascorbate could rescue TET3 expression and inhibit cell proliferation. Taken together, these results indicate that TET3 expression regulated cell proliferation, which is associated with 5hmC in HepG2 cells.

AB Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are crucial coordinators of intracellular signalling in response to the extracellular stimulators. Hyperactivation of PI3K signalling cascades is one among the most ordinary events in human cancers. Focusing on the PI3K pathway remains both a chance and a challenge for cancer therapy. The high recurrence of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway adjustments in cancer has led to a surge in the progression of PI3K inhibitors. Recent developments incorporate a re-assessment of the oncogenic mechanisms behind PI3K pathway modifications. Receptor tyrosine kinases upstream of PI3K, the p110a catalytic fractional unit of PI3K, the downstream kinase, AKT, and therefore the negative regulator, PTEN, are all often altered in cancer. In this review, we consider about the phosphoinositide 3-kinases family and mechanisms of PI3K-Akt stimulation in cancer.

AB Rainbow trout have, as salmonid fish species, undergone sequential genome duplication events in their evolutionary history. In addition to a teleost-specific whole genome duplication approximately 320-350 million years ago, rainbow trout and salmonids in general underwent an additional salmonid lineage-specific genome duplication event approximately 80 million years ago. Through the recent sequencing of salmonid genome sequences, including the rainbow trout, the identification and study of duplicated genes has become available. A particular focus of interest has been the evolution and regulation of rainbow trout gluconeogenic genes, as recent molecular and gene expression evidence points to a possible contribution of previously uncharacterized gluconeogenic gene paralogues to the rainbow trout long-studied glucose intolerant phenotype. Since the publication of the initial rainbow trout genome draft, resequencing and annotation have further improved genome coverage. Taking advantage of these recent improvements, we here identify a salmonid-specific genome duplication of ancestral mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 isoenzyme, we termed pck2a and pck2b. Cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1) and, more recently mitochondrial Pck2, are considered to be the rate-limiting enzymes in de novo gluconeogenesis. Following in silico confirmation of salmonid pck2a and pck2b evolutionary history, we simultaneously profiled cytosolic pck1 and mitochondrial pck2a and pck2b expression in rainbow trout liver under several experimental conditions known to regulate hepatic gluconeogenesis. Cytosolic pck1 abundance was increased by nutritional (diets with a high protein to carbohydrate ratio compared to diets with a low carbohydrate to protein ratio) and glucoregulatory endocrine factors (glucagon and cortisol), revealing that the well-described transcriptional regulation of pck1 in mammals is present in rainbow trout. Conversely, and in contrast to mammals, we here describe endocrine regulation of pck2a (decrease in abundance in response to glucagon infusion), and nutritional, social-status-dependent and hypoxia-dependent regulation of pck2b. Specifically, pck2b transcript abundance increased in trout fed a diet with a low protein to carbohydrate ratio compared to a diet with a high protein to carbohydrate ratio, in dominant fish compared to subordinate fish as well as hypoxia. This specific and differential expression of rainbow trout pck2 ohnologues is indicative of functional diversification, and possible functional consequences are discussed in light of the recently highlighted gluconeogenic roles of mitochondrial pck2 in mammalian models.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in the world, with characteristics of high morbidity and mortality. Identifying clinically practical targets and uncovering the potential mechanism for HCC were urgent for us. Though aberrantly expressed miR-99b-3p has been reported in several cancers, the expression and roles of miR-99b-3p in HCC remain uncovered. In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that miR-99b-3p was overexpressed in HCC by our findings and data from GEO datasets. Statistical analysis revealed that highly expressed miR-99b-3p was closely related to malignant clinicopathological characteristics and poorer prognosis of HCC patients. Furthermore, results from Wound healing assay, Transwell assays, 344,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)assay and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay revealed that miR-99b-3p played a promoting role in migration, invasion and proliferation of HCC cells. Then, by bioinformatics tools, luciferase reporter gene assay, integrative database analysis, and Pearson correlation analysis and so on, protocadherin 19 (PCDH19) was identified as the target of miR-99b-3p in HCC cells. Furthermore, rescue experiments were conducted to confirm the mediator role of PCDH19 for miR-99b-3p. Collectively, we demonstrate that miR-99b-3p promotes HCC metastasis and proliferation by directly targeting PCDH19. MiR-99b-3p may become a potential therapy target for HCC.

AB Objective: Investigating the expression of the lnc RNAs screened above between normal and insulin resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Addressing the mechanism underlying the regulation of inflammation response by lnc TINCR.
   Methods: 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiate into mature adipocytes. Oil red 0 staining was used to find the fat droplets in mature adipocytes. Mature adipocytes were randomized to normal control group and Tri-DAP (NOD1 ligand) group. After the establishment of insulin resistance model, we used deep RNA sequencing(RNA-Seq) to identify lncRNAs that are regulated during NODI activation in mouse adipocytes. Real-time PCR was used to analyze the expression of lnc TINCR, proinflammatory IL-6, TNF-alpha, Cxcl1 and RIPK2 in the presence or absence of Tri-DAP(10 mu g/ml). We employed siRNA against lnc TINCR to confirm its effects in inflammatory response.
   Results: Deep RNA sequencing identified 81 lncRNAs and 167 coding genes that were significantly up-related while 78 lncRNAs and 82 coding genes that were significantly down-related greater than twofold during NOD1 activation in adipocytes. We discovered that lnc TINCR, termed lnc TINCR(Tri-DAP-inducible non-protein coding RNA) is greatly upregulated in Tri-DAP activated adipocytes. Moreover knockdown of lnc TINCR dampens the proinflammatory response (P < 0.05; in adipocytes).
   Conclusions: lnc TINCR is a positive regulator of inflammation-induced insulin resistance presumably via activation of NOD1 signaling pathways.

AB Pathological cardiac hypertrophy (CH) is associated with increased heart failure risk and sudden cardiac death. Several transcription factors (TFs) and miRNAs were implicated in CH, and their high combinatorial action in gene expression regulation is becoming more clear. We adopted a systems biology approach to construct a comprehensive TF-miRNA co-regulatory network in CH and systematically characterize its structure, from node to systems-level properties. Parallel expression profiles for miRNAs and messenger RNA (mRNA) from an in vitro model of CH were integrated with experimentally validated interactions from seven curated databases to build the CH-related TF-miRNA regulatory network. To leverage this network, we proposed a completely unsupervised approach to identify core regulatory elements, based on Borda count aggregation of distinct network-based properties. By combining node scores derived from motif-based centrality, active pathways, and k-shell index, our approach was able to prioritize biologically meaningful TFs (e.g., MYC, SP1, AKR1B1, EGR1, NFKB1, and ETS1) and miRNAs (e.g., hsa-let-7i-5p, hsa-let-7e-5p, hsa-miR-21a-5p, and hsa-miR-27b-5p) as central nodes in the network and point potential active regulatory pathways in CH. Our findings suggest distinct roles of TFs and miRNAs, which tend to act mostly as network bottlenecks and hubs, respectively. Moreover, we identified feed forward loop motifs and recurrent associations in the crosstalk between TFs and miRNAs, observing extensive synergistic regulation of common targets and cascade signaling among regulators. Interestingly, most TFs and miRNAs were engaged in specific regulatory roles or interconnection patterns (i.e., master regulator, intermediate regulator, co-regulation of a common target gene, reciprocal regulation, or downstream target) within this network, while few had multiplicity observed in their network function. The constructed CH-related regulatory network has the potential to provide new insights about key regulators, molecular mechanisms, and the interplay between miRNAs and TFs in the pathogenesis of CH, which after proper experimental validation may contribute to the search for new therapeutic approaches.

AB Coronary artery disease (CAD) is primarily caused by atherosclerosis, which is a series of chronic inflammatory processes leading to the initiation and progression of vascular endothelial cell injury enhancing plaque formation. As critical components of the immune system, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) actively crosstalk with pathophysiological conditions induced by endothelial cell injury, reflecting in altered PBMC expression pattern. This study explored PBMC expression levels of miR-21, miR-25 and PTEN in patients with angiographically proven significant coronary stenosis (the CAD group), patients with insignificant coronary stenosis (the ICAD group) and healthy subjects, and assessed potentials of PBMC expressions in discriminating groups of study subjects. In-silico analysis was also performed to obtain insights into CAD-related pathways and biological processes that may be influenced by altered miRNA expressions. A reduced level of PBMC miR-21 was observed in the ICAD group compared to the CAD group (P: 0.004) or healthy controls (P: 0.0001). PBMC miR-21 level was negatively correlated with the PTEN expression (Spearman r: -0.43, P: -3.9e - 09). The PTEN expression was increased in the CAD or ICAD group compared to the control group (CAD vs. controls P: 0.0003, ICAD vs. controls P: 0.03). A stepwise increase in PBMC miR-25 levels was observed from healthy controls to ICADs and CAD patients (Kruskal-Wallis P: 7.68e - 12). PBMC gene expressions had reasonable power to discriminate between pairs of study groups. PBMC miR-21 levels were able to discriminate ICADs from both CADs and controls and miR-25 levels had potentials to differentiate among all pairs of study groups (i.e. CADs-ICADs, CADs-controls, CADs-all other subjects, ICADs-controls). PBMC PTEN expression was able to discriminate patients with CAD or ICAD from control subjects. Overrepresentation enrichment analysis of experimentally validated targets of miR-21 and miR-25 highlighted key biological processes and pathways, such as "angiogenesis" and "leukocyte cell-cell adhesion", that may be influenced by dysregulation of PBMC miR-21 and miR-25. In conclusion, these findings suggest that patients with insignificant coronary stenosis may have a distinct PBMC miRNA expression profile than those with significant stenosis or healthy controls.

AB Objective: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ginger supplementation on the expression of some immunity and inflammation intermediate genes in patients who suffer from RA.
   Methods: In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, seventy active RA patients were allocated randomly into two groups who either received 1500 mg ginger powder or placebo daily for 12 weeks. Disease activity score and gene expression of NF-kappa B, PPAR-gamma, FoxP3, T-bet, GATA-3, and ROR gamma t as immunity and inflammation intermediate factors were measured using quantitative real-time PCR before and after the intervention.
   Results: After the intervention, FoxP3 genes expression increased significantly within ginger group and between the two groups (P-value = 0.02). Besides, T-bet and ROR gamma t genes expression decreased significantly between the two groups (P-value < 0.05). In ginger group, PPAR-gamma genes expression increased significantly (P value = 0.047) but the difference between the two groups wasn't statistically significant (P-value = 0.12). The reduction in disease activity score was statistically significant within ginger group and between the two groups after the intervention.
   Conclusion: It seems that ginger can improve RA by decreasing disease manifestations via increasing FoxP3 genes expression and by decreasing ROR gamma t and T-bet genes expression.

AB Background: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene plays a key role in angiogenesis and tumor growth. The relationship between VEGF gene polymorphisms and bladder cancer (BCa) risk was studied extensively in recent years. However, the currently available results are controversial. To ascertain whether VEGF polymorphisms are associated with the susceptibility to BCa, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Materials and methods: Relevant studies were collected systemically from PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of Science databases and the Cochrane Library. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated using random or fixed effects models by Stata statistical software. This systematic review protocol was registered at International prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) under number CRD42018099279.
   Results: A total of eight articles including twenty case-control studies with 3206 BCa cases and 3645 controls were enrolled for this meta-analysis. By pooling all eligible studies, we found that rs3025039, rs833052 and rs25648 polymorphisms were significantly associated with BCa risk. However, in subgroup analyses by stage, we identified a decreased association between the rs699947 A-allele and Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer (MIBC) under allele contrast, homozygous and recessive genetic models (A vs C: OR = 0.76; AA vs CC: OR = 0.49, 95%CI = 0.27-0.90, I-2 = 0.0%, P = 0.021; AA vs CA + CC: OR = 0.60, 95%CI = 0.38-0.96, I-2 = 0.0%, P = 0.034). As to ethnicity subgroup analysis, rs699947 and rs3025039 polymorphisms were thought as a risk factor for BCa risk in Asian population, while a decreased association was revealed between rs699947 (C > A) A-allele and BCa risk in African population under dominant, recessive, homozygous, heterozygous and allele contrast genetic models. While for other polymorphisms, null results were found.
   Conclusion: Our meta-analysis suggested that rs3025039 (C > T), rs833052 (C > A) and rs25648 (C > T) polymorphisms of VEGF gene increased susceptibility to BCa risk. And our study also demonstrated homozygous TT genotype in rs3025039, homozygous AA genotype in rs833052 and homozygous TT genotype in rs25648 were significantly relevant to elevated BCa risk. In the meanwhile, it is worth noting that rs699947 (C > A) A allele should be thought as a protective factor for MIBC.

AB The 11th African Rotavirus Symposium was held in Lilongwe, Malawi from May 28th to 30th 2017. Over 270 delegates (73% from Africa) from 40 countries of which 30 (75%) were from African countries attended the symposium. Participants in this symposium included research scientists, clinicians, immunization managers, public health officials, policymakers and vaccine manufacturers. At the time of the symposium, 38 of the 54 (70%) countries in Africa had introduced rotavirus vaccines into their national immunization schedules. Delegates shared progress from rotavirus surveillance and vaccine impact monitoring, demonstrating the impact of the vaccine against rotavirus diarrheal hospitalizations. Data supported the beneficial effect and safety of WHO pre-qualified available vaccines up to 2017 (RotaTeq, Rotarix). This symposium highlighted the dramatic impact of the rotavirus vaccination, called for urgent adoption of these vaccines in remaining countries, particularly those with high disease burden and large birth cohorts (e.g. Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo) to attain the full public health benefits of rota virus vaccination in Africa.

AB Vaccines play an essential role in preventing infectious diseases. Their registration in importing countries is often cumbersome and unpredictably lengthy, leading to delays in vaccine access for populations that need them most. This report builds on a previous publication identifying challenges for registration of vaccines in emerging countries. As a matter of social responsibility, it was judged necessary to address the challenges and offer a set of solutions for open dialogue. Based on regular exchange of information and experiences, a group of regulatory experts from the vaccine industry developed three sets of proposals for consideration by vaccine stakeholders, with a view to improving the situation, by fostering regulatory convergence, with viable options for streamlining registration procedures through reliance on other experienced regulators or international agencies. Further, it offers options for alignment of structure and contents of Common Technical Document modules and presents a harmonized template application form that could potentially be used by all countries.

DE Social media; Conspiracy beliefs; Vaccines; Political ideology
ID ONLINE; SEARCH
AB Background: Conspiracies about vaccination are prevalent. We assessed how the health information sources people rely upon and their political ideologies are associated with acceptance of vaccine conspiracies.
   Methods: Online survey (N = 599) on Amazon's Mechanical Turk crowdsource platform. Hypotheses were tested via structural equation modeling.
   Results: Acceptance of vaccine conspiracy beliefs was associated positively with greater reliance on social media for health information (coef. = 0.42, p < .001), inversely related to use of medical websites (coef. = -0.21, p < .001), and not significantly related to use of providers for health information (coef. = -0.13, p = .061). In addition, liberal political orientation was negatively associated with acceptance of vaccine conspiracies (coef. = -0.29, p < .001).
   Conclusions: An understanding of vaccine conspiracy acceptance requires a consideration of people's health information sources. The greater susceptibility of political conservatives to conspiracy beliefs extends to the topic of vaccination. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: This study aimed to (1) assess the accuracy of parental recall of adolescent (11-17 years) daughters' HPV vaccine initiation in a low-income, urban Hispanic population, and (2) describe the correlates of accurate recall.
   Methods: We compared parental recall of HPV vaccine naivety to daughter's electronic medical records to calculate the proportion of parents accurately reporting HPV naive status. We used mixed effects logistic regression to identify correlates of accurate recall.
   Results: We verified vaccination status for 1103 daughters of participants who reported their daughters were HPV vaccine-naive; 69.3% of parents accurately reported their daughters as HPV vaccine-naive. Parents of older daughters (13-17 years) compared to younger daughters (11-12 years) had significantly lower odds of accurately reporting daughters as unvaccinated (AOR = 0.60; 95% CI 0.42-0.83).
   Discussion: Underreporting of vaccination status among our study population corresponds with national data that suggest lower income and minority populations underreport HPV vaccination initiation and completion. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite global recommendations for influenza vaccination of high-risk, target populations, few low and middle-income countries have national influenza vaccination programs. Between 2012 and 2017, Lao PDR planned and conducted a series of activities to develop its national influenza vaccine program as a part of its overall national immunization program. In this paper, we review the underlying strategic planning for this process, and outline the sequence of activities, research studies, partnerships, and policy decisions that were required to build Laos' influenza vaccine program. The successful development and sustainability of the program in Laos offers lessons for other low and middle-income countries interested in initiating or expanding influenza immunization.

AB Clinical and post-licensure data have demonstrated that AS03-adjuvanted inactivated split virion vaccines, many with reduced antigen content, are effective against influenza infection. The objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive assessment of the safety of trivalent seasonal, monovalent pre-pandemic and pandemic AS03-adjuvanted influenza vaccines, based on non-clinical, clinical and post-licensure data in various populations. Non-clinical studies on local tolerance, toxicology and safety pharmacology did not raise any safety concerns with AS03 administered alone or combined with various influenza antigens. Data from clinical trials with over 55,000 vaccinated subjects showed that AS03-adjuvanted influenza vaccines were generally well tolerated and displayed an acceptable safety profile, although the power to detect rare events was limited. Approximately 90 million doses of A/H1N1pdm09 pandemic influenza vaccines (Pandemrix and Arepanrix H1N1) were administered worldwide, which contributed post-licensure data to the collective safety data for AS03-adjuvanted influenza vaccines. An association between Pandemrix and narcolepsy was observed during the A/H1N1pdm09 pandemic, for which a role of a CD4 T cell mimicry sequence in the haemagglutinin protein of A/H1N1pdm09 cannot be excluded. Provided that future AS03-adjuvanted influenza vaccines do not contain this putative mimicry sequence, this extensive safety experience supports the further development and use of AS03-adjuvanted inactivated split virion candidate vaccines against seasonal and pandemic influenza infections.

AB Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) prevents extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and death among infants but fails to consistently and sufficiently prevent pulmonary TB in adults. Thus, TB remains the leading infectious cause of death worldwide, and new vaccine approaches are urgently needed. T-cells are important for protective immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), but the optimal T-cell antigens to be included in new vaccines are not established. T-cells are often thought of as responding mainly to peptide antigens presented by polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I and II molecules. Over the past two decades, the number of non-peptidic Mtb derived antigens for alpha beta and gamma delta T-cells has expanded rapidly, creating broader perspectives about the types of molecules that could be targeted by T-cell-based vaccines against TB. Many of these non-peptide responsive T-cell subsets in humans are activated in a manner that is unrestricted by classical MHC-dependent antigen-presenting systems, but instead require essentially nonpolymorphic presentation systems. These systems are Cluster of differentiation 1 (CD1), MHC related protein 1 (MR1), butyrophilin 3A1, as well as the nonclassical MHC class Ib family member HLA-E. Thus, the resulting T-cell responses can be shared among a genetically diverse population, creating the concept of donor-unrestricted T-cells (DURTs). Here, we review evidence that DURTs are an abundant component of the human immune system and recognize many antigens expressed by Mtb, including antigens that are expressed in BCG and other candidate whole cell vaccines. Further, DURTs exhibit functional diversity and demonstrate the ability to control microbial infection in small animal models. Finally, we outline specific knowledge gaps and research priorities that must be addressed to realize the full potential of DURTs as part of new TB vaccines approaches. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Introduction: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has been proven to effectively protect against HPV infection and infection-associated cancer. However, there are concerns about the relationship between HPV vaccination and the risk of autoimmune disorders (ADs). Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the relationship between HPV vaccination and ADs risk.
   Methods: To identify relevant studies, we conducted a systematic search in EMBASE and PubMed databases of scientific articles published through June 2018. Fixed or random effects models were adopted to estimate overall relative risk.
   Results: In total, 20 studies (12 cohort studies, 6 case-control studies, and 2 randomized controlled trials) involving more than 169,000 AD events were included in our meta-analysis. Our results show that HPV vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of subsequent ADs (odds ratio [OR] = 1.003, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95-1.06), particularly among those with a prior ADs (OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.7-0.96). Most of the subgroup analysis results based on the location or type of ADs were consistent with the overall results
   Conclusion: No evidence of an association between HPV vaccination and ADs was found. Given the low number of estimates for individual AD, additional and larger observational studies are needed to verify our findings. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Poliovirus and rotavirus share notable similarities. Although rotavirus is not amenable to eradication because of animal reservoirs, live, attenuated oral vaccines have been the bedrock of both prevention and control programs, providing intestinal and humoral immunity. Both programs have also encountered safety concerns and suboptimal immune responses to oral vaccines in low-income settings that have been challenges, prompting the search for alternative solutions. In this paper, we review the progress made by polio prevention and eradication efforts over the past six decades. Specifically, we discuss the roles of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) and the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in achieving polio eradication, and explore potential application of these lessons to rotavirus. Recent scientific evidence has confirmed that a combined schedule of IPV and OPV adds synergistic value that may give the polio eradication effort the tools to end all poliovirus circulation worldwide. For rotavirus, oral vaccine is the only currently licensed and recommended vaccine for use in all children worldwide, providing heterologous protection against a broad range of strains. However, parenteral rotavirus vaccines are in the pre-clinical and clinical trial stage and insight from polio provides strong justification for accelerating the development of these vaccines. While challenges for parenteral rotavirus vaccines will need to be addressed, such as achieving protection against a broad range of strains, the principle of combined use of oral and parenteral rotavirus vaccines may provide the necessary humoral and intestinal immunity necessary to close the efficacy gaps between developing and developed countries, therefore controlling rotavirus worldwide. This strategy may also potentially reduce risk of intussusception. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Recent outbreaks and renewed concerns about immunization coverage call for new and effective interventions to improve vaccine uptake. Digital technologies have the potential to help address both suboptimal vaccine uptake and series completion. However, the effectiveness of pushing information and reminders to patients through digital technologies to address vaccination is not known.
   Objective(s): The aim of this study is to determine if digital push interventions are effective in increasing vaccine uptake and series completion compared to non-digital interventions.
   Methods: We searched for RCTs where adults or parents of children were eligible for vaccination, the intervention was digital-push and the comparison group was non-digital. We included outcomes of vaccine uptake or series completion. We estimated summary effect sizes, heterogeneity using the chi(2) test and quantified using the 12 statistic. Where heterogeneity remained significant, we conducted subgroup analyses. We assessed risk of bias, certainty of evidence and publication bias.
   Results: The search identified 159 peer-reviewed scientific publications. After review, a total of 12 manuscripts representing 13 empirical studies published between 2012 and 2016 were included. When comparing digital push interventions to non-digital ones, patients had 1.18[1.11,1.25] the odds of receiving vaccination or series completion compared to controls. In parents of children aged 18 and younger, those receiving digital push had a 1.22[1.15,1.30] increased odds compared to controls. Both analyses had high statistical heterogeneity, with 12 values of 86% and 79% respectively. The risk of bias was low with 10 of 13 studies considered low risk in five or more domains. The certainty of evidence for series completion was very low and for vaccine uptake was assessed to be moderate.
   Conclusion: This study provides evidence that digital push technologies have a modest, positive impact on vaccine uptake and series completion compared to non-digital interventions. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduced for mass immunization in the 1920s, vaccines against diphtheria are among the oldest and safest vaccines known. The basic principle of their production is the inactivation of purified diphtheria toxin by formaldehyde cross-linking, which converts the potentially fatal toxin in a completely harmless protein aggregate, which is still immunogenic. Since in addition to diphtheria toxin also other proteins may be secreted by Corynebacterium diphtheriae during cultivation, we assumed that diphtheria toxoid might not be the only component present in the vaccine. To address this question, we established a protocol to reverse formaldehyde cross-linking and carried out mass spectrometric analyses. Different secreted, membrane-associated and cytoplasmic proteins of C. diphtheriae were detected in several vaccine preparations from across the world. Based on these results, bioinformatics and Western blot analyses were applied to characterize if these proteins are immunogenic and may therefore support protection against C diphtheriae. In frame of this study, we could show that the C diphtheriae toxoid vaccines induce antibodies against different C. diphtheriae proteins and against diphtheria toxin secreted by Corynebacterium ulcerans, an emerging pathogen which is outnumbering C diphtheriae as cause of diphtheria-like illness in Western Europe.

AB Objective: To evaluate the economic impact of the current measles vaccination program in Zhejiang Province, east China.
   Methods: A decision tree-Markov model with parameters from published literatures, government documents and surveys was developed and used to simulate over 40 years of a birth cohort in Zhejiang Province during the year 2014. The expected cost and effectiveness of the current measles vaccination program was compared against no vaccination. Costs were assessed from the payer's perspective. Benefits were defined as savings on the direct cost of measles treatment, and the effectiveness was measured according to the number of measles cases and deaths averted. The net present value (NPV), benefit-cost ratio (BCR) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were also calculated. A threshold for cost-effectiveness of less than 3 times the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita was used. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to assess parameter uncertainties.
   Results: The total vaccination cost was estimated to be $2.52 million. The BCR of the current measles program was found to be 6.06 with a NPV of $7338 million. It was also calculated that a total of 195,165 measles cases and 191 measles-related deaths would be prevented by vaccination. The ICER was approximately $12.91 per case averted and $13,213.43 per death averted, respectively, which was cost-effective. The models were proven to be robust.
   Conclusions: The current measles vaccination program appeared to be cost-effective and to offer substantial benefits. The results of this analysis sought to contribute to the justification of future investments to achieve the goal of measles elimination. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Vellore district in southern India was selected for intensified immunization efforts through India's Mission Indradhanush campaign based on 74% coverage in the National Family Health Survey in 2015. As rural households rely almost entirely on the Universal Immunization Program (UIP), we assessed routine immunization coverage and factors associated with vaccination status of children in rural Vellore.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional household survey among parents or primary caretakers of children aged 12-23 months during August-September 2017 using two-stage, EPI cluster sampling. We verified vaccination histories from vaccination cards and collected data on sociodemographic and non-socio-demographic characteristics by using mobile data capture. Associations with vaccination status were examined with univariate and multivariate logistic regression models.
   Results: A total of 643 children were included. Coverage of BCG, third dose pentavalent/DPT, measles/MR vaccines and full vaccination (BCG, three doses of polio and pentavalent/DPT and measles/MR vaccines) among children with vaccination cards (n = 606) was 94%, 96%, 93% and 84%, respectively. Of children with vaccination cards, 70.8% had received all recommended doses according to the UIP schedule. No socio-demographic differences were identified, but parents' familiarity with the schedule (Adjusted Prevalence Odds Ratio (aPOR): 2.06, 95%Cl = 1.26-3.38) and receiving information on recommended vaccinations during antenatal visits (aPOR: 2.16, 95% CI = 1.13-4.12) were significantly associated with full vaccination status of the children.
   Conclusions: We found higher UIP antigen coverage and proportion of fully vaccinated children than previously reported from rural Vellore. However, adherence to the recommended schedule was still not optimal. Our study highlights the potential of improving parental awareness of vaccination schedule and targeting health education interventions at pregnant women during antenatal visits to sustain and improve routine immunization coverage.

AB Introduction: Exploring factors underlying disparities in immunization uptake is highly relevant and can contribute to improved immunization interventions globally. The Gambia is an interesting case, since higher immunization coverage in rural areas has been shown for many years, yet the factors explaining this unexpected rural-urban disparity have not been studied. The aim of our study was to quantify the rural-urban disparity in immunization coverage and identify factors that contribute to explaining it.
   Methods: Data from the nationally representative Demographic and Health Survey 2013 was used to select children aged 12-23 months (Weighted n = 1644) for the study. The outcome measure was full immunization status, the grouping variable was area of residence. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the proportions of full immunization and rural-urban residence across the exposure variables. The Fairlie decomposition technique was used to decompose factors contributing to explaining the coverage disparity.
   Results: The findings show that there is a disparity of 16.06 percentage points to the advantage of the rural areas and the exposure variables explained 76.49% of the disparity. Material factors explained 92.03% of the explained disparity with maternal occupation and household wealth quintile being the only significant individual material variable contributors to the explained disparity. Lower household wealth quintile and working especially in agriculture were associated with higher immunization coverage and they were more common in rural areas. Religion and mother's age group e each contributed somewhat to the explained inequality.
   Conclusions: There was a large immunization coverage disparity between rural and urban areas in The Gambia. This disparity was mainly explained by mothers working in agriculture and living in the poorest households, being more likely to immunize their children - unexpected findings. Our study showed that the drivers of healthcare disparities differ by setting and deserve more research. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   PATHOGENESIS
AB Shigellosis is an acute invasive disease of the lower intestine, which afflicts millions of people worldwide with an estimated one million fatalities per annum. Despite of extensive research during the last two decades, a vaccine against multi-drug resistant Shigella is not yet available in the market. To provide a safe, effective and broad-spectrum vaccine against Shigella, we explored food grade bacteria Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) for the delivery of conserved antigenic protein; Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) to the mucosal sites for effective elicitation of systemic and mucosal immunity. We have previously confirmed the immunogenic potential of recombinant L. lactis expressing OmpA (LacVax (R) OmpA) in BALB/c mice. In the present study, we have characterized the humoral and cellular immune profile of LacVax (R) OmpA and assessed its protective efficacy using a newly developed human like murine shigellosis model. The significant increase in OmpA specific serum IgG, fecal sIgA and a Th1 dominant immune response (indicated by high INF-gamma/IL-4 ratio) in LacVax (R) OmpA immunized mice revealed successful activation of humoral and cellular immunity. The LacVax (R) OmpA immunized animals were also protected from human-like shigellosis when challenged with S. flexneri 2a ATCC 12022. The antigen specific serum IgG, fecal sIgA, INF-gamma and IL-10 levels were found to be the significant correlates of protection. Collectively these results suggest that the LacVax (R) OmpA is a promising prophylactic candidate against shigellosis. However, the protective efficacy of LacVax (R) OmpA in the higher animals would further strengthen its future application in humans. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Helicobacter pylori is a pathogenic bacterium that infects the stomach, causing chronic gastritis; and it is also considered to be related to the occurrence of gastric cancers. Although some eradication regimens including multiple antibiotics have been developed, the emergence of resistance to antibiotics becomes problematic. Therefore, other approaches to compensate or augment the effects of standard regimens are needed. In this study, we examined the possible synergistic effects of anti-H. pylori urease IgY and Lactobacillus johnsonii No.1088 (LJ88) both in vitro and in vivo. Anti-H. pylori urease IgY was purified from egg yolks laid by the hens immunized with urease purified from H. pylori. LJ88 is a unique strain of lactic acid bacterium isolated from human gastric juice, and it has been reported to inhibit H. pylori both in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro mixed culture study showed that anti-H. pylori urease IgY augmented the anti-H. pylori activity of LJ88 against both clarithromycin-sensitive and-resistant H. pylori strains. In a germ-free mice infection model, combined administration of daily anti-H. pylori urease IgY and weekly living LJ88 significantly reduced H. pylori infections, whereas either monotherapy did not. In an in vivo human gut microbiota-associated mice model, not only daily administration of living LJ88 but also heat-killed one significantly reduced an H. pylori infection in the stomach when combined with anti-H. pylori urease IgY. The extent of reduction of the stomach H. pylori by such a combination therapy was larger than that reported for LJ88 monotherapy. These results taken together revealed a synergistic effect of anti-H. pylori urease IgY and living or heat-killed LJ88, thus suggesting that such a combination might be a promising therapy to possibly compensate and/or augment standard anti-H. pylori regimens.

AB Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and Moraxella catarrhalis (Mcat) are frequent pathogens in acute exacerbations of COPD. We assessed the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of different investigational vaccine formulations containing surface proteins of NTHi (PD andPE-PilA) and Mcat (UspA2) in adults with smoking history >= 10 pack-years, to immunologically represent the COPD population.
   Participants received two doses 60 days apart in a randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT02547974). In step 1, 30 healthy adults aged 18-40 years were randomised (1:1) to receive a non-adjuvanted formulation (10-10-PLAIN) or placebo. In step 2, 90 smokers/ex-smokers aged 5070 years randomly (1:1:1) received an AS01-adjuvanted formulation containing either 10 mu g of each antigen (10-10-AS01) or 10 mu g of each NTHi antigen and 3.3 mu g of Mcat antigen (10-3-AS01), or placebo.
   Incidences of solicited local adverse events (AEs) tended to be highest in the AS01-adjuvanted vaccine groups. Most solicited AEs had mild/moderate intensity. No vaccine-related serious AEs were reported. The 10-3-AS01 formulation induced the best humoral immune response against the NTHi antigens. Responses against the Mcat antigen were similar across groups, with waning immunogenicity after 30 days post-dose 2.
   The investigational NTHi-Mcat vaccine had an acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile and good immunogenicity in older adults with a smoking history. (C) 2019 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Our objectives were: (1) to quantify and describe un-immunized students in Ontario, Canada and assess the extent to which these students have exemptions; and (2) to quantify and describe students with non-medical exemptions (NMEs), including what proportion have up-to-date immunizations.
   Methods: We examined Ontario students 7 to 17 years-of-age in the 2016-2017 school year using information within a centralized immunization repository. We identified and described students with different immunization/exemption classifications by age, sex, school type, geography and area-level material deprivation using descriptive and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Finally, we assessed the immunization status of students with NMEs, by antigen.
   Results: We found that students could be recorded as un-immunized with or without an NME, or be immunized with an NME. From a cohort of 1.65 million students, 2.9% of students had zero vaccine doses recorded, and of these 68% had no exemption of any kind. A total of 2.4% of students had an NME. Of these, 39% were un-immunized and 61% had received >= 1 vaccine. Among all students with NMEs, 19-48% had up-to-date immunizations, varying by antigen. Factors associated with increased odds of having a NME and being un-immunized included: attendance at private and 'other' schools, rural residence, and geography. Older age and greater area-level deprivation were associated with a reduced odds.
   Conclusions: Our assessment revealed that Ontario students with NMEs cannot be assumed to be un-immunized and at risk for all vaccine-preventable diseases. Conversely, not all un-immunized students had NMEs suggesting that future studies of un-immunized children in Ontario must consider additional factors beyond NME status alone. Other jurisdictions that use NME data to inform research and surveillance of vaccine hesitancy and risks for VPD outbreaks may wish to undertake a similar assessment to determine how well student NMEs correlate with student immunization status.

AB Background: The evidence for recommendations regarding vaccination in solid organ transplant recipients is sparse. There is little data comparing vaccine responses between groups on different immunosuppressive drugs. This study was conducted to evaluate the antibody response to Dukoral (R) oral cholera vaccine in renal transplant recipients (RTR).
   Methods: In a single-center non-randomized controlled clinical trial, healthy volunteers (n = 21) and renal transplant recipients (n = 30) were vaccinated with the oral whole cell/recombinant B subunit cholera vaccine Dukoral (R) (Valneva Inc., Vienna, Austria). The RTR were stratified according to their maintenance immunosuppressive therapy: either prednisone and a calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine A or tacrolimus; P/CNI group; n = 15) or prednisone and mycophenolate (P/MMF group; n = 15). All volunteers ingested Dukoral (R) at baseline and at day 14. Serum samples were drawn at day 0 and day 21. The primary outcome was seroconversion, defined as either a 3-fold IgA serum titer increase in anti-cholera toxin B antibodies and/or a 4-fold rise in the serum vibriocidal titer.
   Results: Follow-up was complete. Seroconversion after vaccination was 57% (standard error, SE 9%) in RTR and 81% (SE 9%) in healthy controls (Relative Risk, RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.48-1.02). When stratified according to maintenance immunosuppression, the seroconversion rate was 67% (SE 12%) in the P/CNI group (RR compared with controls 0.82; 95% CI 0.55-1.25) and 47% (SE 13%) in the P/MMF group (RR compared with controls 0.58; 95% CI 0.32-1.03).
   Conclusion: Adverse events were mild to moderate and transient. The response to Dukoral was weaker and the seroconversion rate was lower in renal transplant recipients than in healthy controls. In particular, those using mycophenolate had a poor response. Nevertheless, more than half of the transplant recipients seroconverted. Therefore oral vaccines should not be discarded as a potential tool for protection of solid organ transplant recipients. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rhodococcus opacus PD630 was used to produce biomass and lipids in molasses-based media with and without osmotic stress. In a 7-day aerobic batch culture at 30 degrees C, the biomass and lipid concentrations were maximized using an initial molasses concentration of 80 g/L and ammonium acetate (nitrogen source) concentration of 2.14 g/L. At a fixed initial molasses concentration of 80 g/L, the concentration of the nitrogen source was further fine-tuned to 2.25 g/L, to maximize the lipid content of the biomass to around 30% by dry mass. This medium was used to test the effects of stressing salts (sodium acetate, magnesium sulfate, sodium chloride) on production of lipids and biomass. A two-step bolus feeding with magnesium sulfate and sodium acetate, enhanced the final biomass concentration to around 19 g/L (a 50% increase relative to control), but the lipid content in the biomass was reduced to around 16% w/w. A 33% enhancement in lipid concentration relative to control, was achieved by feeding magnesium sulfate and sodium acetate. Sugarcane molasses could be effectively used to produce biomass and lipids instead of using the much more expensive pure carbon sources such as glucose and sucrose.

   DISSECTION
AB In the present study, we have developed an inter-molecularly shuffled caulimoviral promoter for protein overexpression by placing the Upstream Activation Sequence (UAS) of Figwort Mosaic Virus (FMV; -249 to -54) at the 5'-end of the Cassava Vein Mosaic Virus (CsVMV) promoter fragment 8 (CsVMV8; -215 to +166) to design a hybrid promoter; FUASCsV8CP. The FUASCsV8CP promoter exhibited approximately 2.1 and 2.0 times higher GUS-activities than that obtained from the CaMV35S promoter, in tobacco (Xanthi Brad) protoplasts and in Agroinfiltration assays respectively. Hereto, when FUASCsV8CP was assayed using transgenic tobacco plants (T-2-generation), it showed 2.0 times stronger activity than CaMV35S promoter and almost equivalent activity to that of CaMV35S(2) promoter. The promoter displayed Salicylic acid (SA) inducibility and hence can also be used for ensuring effective gene expression in plants under constitutive as well as specific inducible conditions. Furthermore, FUASCsV8CP was used to drive the expression of victoviral Vin gene (encoding Victoriocin) transiently in tobacco. The recombinant Victoriocin could be successfully detected by western blotting three days post infiltration. Also, the in vitro Agar-based killing zone assays employing plant-derived Victoriocin-His (obtained from transient expression of Vin) revealed enhanced antifungal activity of Victoriocin against hemi-biotrophic pathogen Phoma exigua Desm. var. exigua.

AB Fluorescent proteins are valuable tools in the bioscience field especially in subcellular localization analysis of proteins and expression analysis of genes. Fusion with organelle-targeting signal accumulates fluorescent proteins in specific organelles, increases local brightness, and highlights the signal of fluorescent proteins even in tissues emitting a high background of autofluorescence. For these advantages, organelle-targeted fluorescent proteins are preferably used for promoter: reporter assay to define organ-, tissue-, or cell-specific expression pattern of genes in detail. In this study, we have developed a new series of Gateway cloning technology-compatible binary vectors, pGWBs (attR1-attR2 acceptor sites) and R4L1pGWB (attR4-attL1 acceptor sites), carrying organelle-targeted synthetic green fluorescent protein with S65T mutation (sGFP) (ER-, nucleus-, peroxisome-, and mitochondria-targeted sGFP) and organelle-targeted tag red fluorescent protein (TagRFP) (nucleus-, peroxisome-, and mitochondria-targeted TagRFP). These are available for preparation of promoter: reporter constructs by an LR reaction with a promoter entry clone attL1-promoter-attL2 (for pGWBs) or attL4-promoter-attR1 (for R4L1pGWBs), respectively. A transient expression experiment with particle bombardment using cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter-driven constructs has confirmed the correct localization of newly developed organelle-targeted TagRFPs by a co-localization analysis with the previously established organelle-targeted sGFPs. More intense and apparent fluorescence signals were detected by the nucleus- and peroxisome- targeted sGFPs than by the normal sGFPs in the promoter assay using transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana. The new pGWBs and R4L1pGWBs developed here are highly efficient and may serve as useful platforms for more accurate observation of GFP and RFP signals in gene expression analyses of plants.

AB Rapid, convenient, sensitive detection methods are of the utmost importance in analytical tools. Enzyme-based signal amplification using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is commonly implemented in clinical diagnostics kits based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), by which the limit of detection is greatly improved. Herein we report the design and preparation of recombinant fusion proteins comprising HRP and streptavidin (Stav), in which HRP was fused to either the N- or C-terminus of Stav ((HRP)(4)-Stav or Stav-(HRP)(4), respectively) using a baculovirus-silkworm expression system. Both (HRP)(4)-Stav and Stav-(HRP)(4) were secreted in the apo form but they were easily converted to the holo form and activated by simple incubation with hemin overnight at 4 degrees C. The activated (HRP)(4)-Stav and Stav-(HRP)(4) could be combined with a commercial biotinylated anti-OVA IgG antibody to detect ovalbumin (OVA) as the antigen in ELISA. The enzymatic activity of (HRP)(4)-Stav was twofold higher than that of Stav-(HRP)(4), and the sensitivity of (HRP)(4)-Stav in ELISA was higher than that of a commercial HRP-Stav chemical conjugate. The successful use of (HRP)(4)-Stav chimeric protein as a molecular probe in ELISA shows that the baculovirus-silkworm expression system is promising to produce enzyme-Stav conjugates to substitute for those prepared by chemical methods.

AB In this study, we improved the synthesis of the latex clearing protein from Gordonia polyisoprenivorans VH2 (Lcp1(VH2)), a key enzyme for the initial cleavage of the rubber backbone. Cultivations using a recombinant strain of Escherichia coli were optimized to overcome poor solubility of Lcp1(VH2) and improve the production yields. Different cultivation temperatures and agitation rates were evaluated in the process to demonstrate their impact on the solubility of Lcp1(VH2). A specific maximum production rate of 28.3 mg Lcp1(VH2) g(-1) cell dry weight h(-1) was obtained at 25 degrees C and at agitation rates between 200-300 rpm. The activity of Lcp1(VH2) was strongly influenced by variations in the cultivation temperature with a specific maximum activity of 0.81 U mg(-1) in cultures incubated at 30 degrees C. Besides cultivation-based optimization, also the strategy of fusion protein expression with NusA was successfully applied. The in vivo solubility of the Lcp1(VH2) fusion protein was calculated to be 73.1%, which means an enhancement of 5.7-fold in comparison to the solubility of the native Lcp1(VH2). The fusion protein of Lcp1(VH2) and NusA still exhibited oxygenase activity with polyisoprene latex as a substrate. In fact, NusA-His-Lcp1(VH2) reached a 4-fold higher volumetric activity in comparison to Lcp1(VH2). Oligo(cis-1,4-isoprene) molecules were produced as degradation products due to the cleavage of the polymer backbone by NusA-His-Lcp1(VH2). The formation of oligo-isoprenoid molecules with molecular weights between 236 and 984 Da were confirmed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis.

AB Scaling of phototrophic bioprocesses can be extremely challenging especially when reactor types in the considered scales differ. In this study, the mean integral photon flux density was used to transfer light-dependent growth kinetics of Nannochloropsis salina 40.85 and Nannochloropsis gaditana 2.99 grown with constant LED irradiation from flat-plate gas-lift photobioreactors (0.09 m(2)) to thin-layer cascade photobioreactors (8 m(2)). Even though completely different reactors were used, comparable growth rates were achieved on both scales with both strains by application of comparable mean light availabilities in the microalgae suspensions. In contrast, the light-dependent growth kinetics change significantly when irradiation varies dynamically (day-night cycles). The maximum intra-day growth rate of N. salina with dynamic climate simulation was doubled to 0.07 h(-1) compared to constant irradiation, but tolerance of the microalgae against excessive irradiation was drastically reduced compared to constant irradiation. Because of that, predicting growth of N. salina in a physically simulated day-night climate would require the determination of the light-dependence of growth with dynamically varying conditions.

AB Introduction: Minimally invasive circulating microRNAs might be used for the preoperative differentiation of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and adrenocortical adenoma (ACA). So far, the best blood-borne microRNA biomarker of ACC is circulating hsa-miR-483-5p. The expression of urinary hsa-miR-483-5p as a non-invasive marker of malignancy and its correlation with plasma hsa-miR-483-5p, has not been investigated, yet.
   Aim: Our aim was to investigate the expression of urinary hsa-miR-483-5p and its correlation with its plasma counterpart.
   Methods: Plasma and urinary samples from 23 ACC and 23 ACA patients were analysed using real-time RT-qPCR. To evaluate the diagnostic applicability of hsa-miR-483-5p, ROC-analysis was performed.
   Results: Significant overexpression of hsa-miR-483-5p was observed in carcinoma patients' plasma samples compared to adenoma patients' (p < 0.0001, sensitivity: 87%, specificity: 78.3%). In urinary samples, however, no significant difference could be detected between ACC and ACA patients.
   Conclusions: Plasma hsa-miR-483-5p has been confirmed as significantly overexpressed in adrenocortical cancer patients and thus might be exploited as a minimally invasive preoperative marker of malignancy. The applicability of urinary hsa-miR-483-5p for the diagnosis of adrenocortical malignancy could not be confirmed.

AB MicroRNAs play an essential role in the regulation of gene expression and tumor development. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can be observed in miRNAs and could influence gene expression.
   We aimed to identify miR-146a rs2910164 and miR-196a-2 rs11614913 polymorphisms in ovarian cancer patients and controls.
   75 patients and 75 controls were involved. DNA was isolated from blood samples. MiR-146a rs2910164 and miR-196a-2 rs11614913 were determined by LightSnip kit. We used melting curve analysis for allele classification. Network analysis was made to find common target genes.
   We detected 72.67% G allele frequency of miR-146a rs2910164 in controls and 82.00% in patients group (p = 0,053). GG, GC and CC genotypes occurred with 53.33%, 38.67% and 8.00% among controls, with 65.33%, 33.33% and 1.33% among patients, (p = 0.0917). Allele C of miR-196a-2 rs11614913 occurred in 59.33% of controls and in 67.33% of patients (p = 0.15). CC, CT and TT genotypes occurred with 37.33%, 44.00%, and 18.67% frequency in controls, with 46.67%; 41.33% and 12.00% in patients (p = 0.3815). Network analysis found ATG9A, LBR, MBD4 and RUFY2 genes to be targets for both miRNAs.
   SNPs of miR-146a and miR-196a-2 showed no significant differences between patients and controls. More investigations are required to clarify the exact role of these SNPs in ovarian cancer.

AB Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death among women that is mostly due to the difficulty of early diagnosis. Circulating miRNAs proved to be reliable biomarkers in various cancers. We screened 9 miRNAs, which are involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, in the plasma samples of patients with malignant (n = 28) or non-malignant (n = 12) ovarian tumors and disease-free healthy volunteers (n = 60) by qRT-PCR. The expression levels of miR200a, miR200b, miR200c, miR141, miR429, miR203a, miR34b (p < 0.001) and miR34a (p < 0.01) were significantly higher in the malignant samples than in healthy controls. MiR203a, miR141 (p < 0.01), miR200a and miR429 (p < 0.05) levels were also higher in malignant compared to non-malignant samples. ROC-AUC was the highest in the case of miR200c: 0.861 (95%CI = 0.776-0.947). Spearman's rank correlation analysis revealed positive correlation between the plasma levels of the studied miRNAs that was the highest between miR200b and miR200c (r(s) = 0.774; p < 0.001). Target analysis also suggested tight interaction between these miRNAs in the regulation of cancer development. The agreement of diagnostic tests based on miRNA levels and the standard CA125 or HE4 was weak according to Cohen's kappa values. We conclude that miR200 family members, miR34b and miR203a might be promising complementary biomarkers in ovarian cancer.

AB The pathological diagnostics of cancer - based on the histological features - is today increasingly completed by molecular profiling at variable depth in an almost evident fashion. Predictive information should cover potential therapeutic targets and/or major resistance mechanisms the nature of which is subject of alteration during the course of the treatment. Mutational profiling recently became technically available by the analysis of circulating free DNA obtained following non-invasive peripheral blood or body fluid sampling. This, "liquid biopsy" approach reflects the general status considering the actual tumor burden, irrespective of the intratumoral distribution and anatomical site. However, the dynamics of the liquid compartment relies on tissue-related processes reflected by histological variables. The amount and composition of free DNA seems to be influenced by many factors, including the stage and anatomical localization of the cancer, the relative mass of neoplastic subclones, the growth rate, the stromal and inflammatory component, the extent of tumor cell death and necrosis. The histopathological context should be considered also when analysis of cfDNA is about to replace repeated tumor sampling for molecular follow-up.

AB With more than 50,000 members, terpenoids are one of the most important classes of natural products and show an enormous diversity. Due to their unique odors and specific bioactivities they already find wide application in the flavor, fragrance and pharma industries. Since most terpenoids can only be obtained by natural product extraction, the discovery of biosynthetic genes for the generation of terpene diversity becomes increasingly important. This study describes the discovery of three novel sesquiterpene synthases from Streptomyces chartreusis with preference for the formation of germacradiene-11-ol, alpha-eudesmol and alpha-amorphene respectively. The alpha-eudesmol synthase showed formation of 10-epi-delta-eudesmol and elemol as side products. Eudesmol-isomers are known to have repellent activity, which makes this enzyme a potential catalyst for products for the prevention of mosquito-related disease. The determination of the structure of the apo-enzyme of alpha-eudesmol synthase from S. chartreusis provides the first structural insights into an eudesmol-forming enzyme.

AB Ethanol ferrmentation of Kappaphycus alvarezii hydrolysates was performed using wild-type (WT) Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN. PK2-1, hexokinase 2 deleted (Delta hxk2) and adapted strain on high galactose concentrations. The WT and Delta hxk2 strains produced 8.9 and 14.67 g/L of ethanol with yield coefficient (Y-EtOH) of 0.20 and 0.33 (g/g), respectively. However, neither the WT nor Delta hxk2strain could utilize all of the galactose, leaving 16.4 and 6.2 g/L of galactose in the fermentation broth, respectively. Therefore, fermentation with S. cerevisiae CEN. PK2-1 adapted to galactose was carried out to increase the ethanol yield coefficient (Y-EtOH), producing a maximum ethanol concentration of 20.0 g/L with a Y-EtOH of 0.44 (g/g). Ethanol concentration of adapted strain was 1.36-2.25 times higher than WT and Delta hxk2 strains. The adapted yeast exhibited the highest transcript levels of GAL genes. The yeast strain via adaptive yeast strain produced ethanol with a higher titer and yield due to a modular activation of GAL genes than WT or the hxk2 deleted strains.

AB Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) is a central perturbation in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and there are currently no effective remedies to improve LVDD in clinical practice. The beta 3-adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) was reported to play protective effects on inhibiting myocardial fibrosis in response to hemodynamic stress. However, the effects of ADRB3 on LVDD and its underlying mechanisms are still undefined. In the current study, the role of ADRB3 in LVDD was identified in ADRB3-knockout mice. Echocardiography parameters showed that depletion of ADRB3 had little effect on cardiac systolic function but obviously led to cardiac diastolic dysfunction in vivo. Proteomics (including the global proteome, phosphorylated and acetylated proteome) and bioinformatics analysis (including GO analysis, KEGG pathway analysis, GO-Tree network, Pathway-Act network, and protein-protein interaction network) were performed on cardiac specimens of ADRB3-KO mice and wild-type mice. The results showed that the cardiac energy metabolism (especially the citrate cycle), actin cytoskeleton organization, and cardiac muscle contraction (related to mitogen-activated protein kinase, toll-like receptor, and ErbB signalling pathway) were potential core mechanisms underlying ADRB3-KO induced LVDD. In addition, the protein-protein interaction network indicated that the core proteins associated with ADRB3-KO induced LVDD were FGG, ALDH1A1, FGA, APOC3, SLC4A1, SERPINF2, HP, CTNNB1, and TKT. In conclusion, the absence of ADRB3 leads to LVDD, which is potentially associated with the regulation of cardiac energy metabolism, actin cytoskeleton organization, and cardiac muscle contraction.

AB Objective: To explore the effect of adeno-associated virus 9-mediated RNA interference targeting SOCS3 (AAV9-SOCS3 siRNA) on the treatment of diastolic heart failure (DHF).
   Method: A rat DHF model was established, and cardiac function and hemodynamic changes were measured. HE, Sirius red and TUNEL staining were applied to observe the pathological changes in the myocardium. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemical staining were utilized to detect SOCS3 expression. The expression levels of various factors, including fibrosis-related factors (collagen I, collagen II, alpha-SMA and TGF-beta), inflammatory-related factors (IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, p-p65 and ICAM-1) and factors related to the JAK/STAT signal pathway were analyzed by immunoblotting and/or qPCR. The serum levels of IL-1(,)beta IL-6, and TNF-alpha were measured using ELISA.
   Results: SOCS3 expression was significantly downregulated in the DHF rat model by SOCS3 siRNA delivery. In the successfully established DHF rat model, cardiac function was clearly decreased, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis and myocardial fibrosis were significantly increased. These changes were ameliorated by treatment with AAV9-SOCS3 siRNA. The expression levels of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 were significantly upregulated in the AAV9-SOCS3 siRNA group compared with the sham and AAV9-siRNA control groups, indicating that SOCS3 is a negative regulator of this signaling pathway. The expression levels of collagen I/Ill, alpha-SMA and TGF-beta were also decreased at both the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, the serum and myocardial tissue expression levels of inflammatory-related factors, such as IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha, were also reduced by the administration of AAV9-SOCS3 siRNA compared with the AAV9-siRNA control.
   Conclusions: SOCS3 gene silencing by AAV9-SOCS3 siRNA administration in a DHF rat model significantly reduced myocardial fibrosis and the inflammatory response and improved heart function. Therefore, this treatment is a potential therapeutic method for treating DHF.

AB Early Embryonic Arrest (EEA) is one of the major causes of female infertility. Genetic factors including specific genes and miRNAs may play pivotal roles on EEA. However, it is not well defined what genes and micro RNAs participate the pathophysiological alterations of EEA. In this work, we compared the Transcriptome-Seq and microRNA profiles from three pairs of villi (three EEA patients and three normal pregnancy, NP). We first confirmed the array data by qPCR with ten randomly selected differentially expressed genes and ten differentially expressed miRNAs in villi from 20 EEA and 20 NP controls. We next applied Gene ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Pathway analysis and found that these differentially expressed genes enriched in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, Complement and coagulation cascades, Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Interestingly, hsa-miR-6515-5p and its target genes NLRP3, UGP2 may regulate the Immune system and carbohydrate metabolism. Hsa-miRNA 518 and its target gene EGR1 may regulate cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and cell apoptosis to impact early embryonic development. Moreover, novel-m0045-5p and its target gene RMDN3 may regulate microtubule formation on the development of EEA. Our research provides novel biomarkers for EEA and establishes a foundation for further study of the mechanism of EEA.

AB Aberrant expression of RBM6 has been implicated in the development of human malignancies. However, the biofunction of RBM6 in laryngocarcinoma is still almost blank. Here we identified that RBM6 was downregulated in laryngocarcinoma tissues, as well as laryngocarcinoma cell lines. Notably, the expression level of RBM6 was lower in laryngocarcinoma patients at stage3/4 than that in laryngocarcinoma patients at stage1/2. Upregulation of RBM6 suppressed the proliferation of TU212 and Hep-2 cells, as shown by decreased cell viability and Ki67 level. In parallel, overexpression of RBM6 inhibited invasion and promoted apoptosis of TU212 and Hep-2 cells, as evidenced by downregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein expression and upregulation of cleaved caspase-3 protein expression. In vivo, RBM6 overexpression repressed the laryngocarcinoma tumor growth. EGFR mRNA level was higher in the laryngocarcinoma tissues than that in the adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, upregulation of RBM6 reduced the expression of EGFR, ERK and p-ERK in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that RBM6 as a tumor suppressor represses the growth and progression in laryngocarcinoma.

AB Chemoreception is critical for marine ectoparasites - such as salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) - to identify and locate salmonid hosts. The molecular receptors that parasites employ to detect host-specific chemical stimuli from hosts (kairomones) have not been well characterised. In the present study, transcription of the sea louse Ionotropic receptor 25a (IR25a) was blocked to evaluate whether it functions as a chemical-perception related gene for a specific chemical cue from the Atlantic salmon host. Double-strand RNA interference (dsRNA) oli-gonucleotides were applied to salmon lice by in vitro transcription and then exposing salmon lice nauplii to dsRNA by soaking overnight. Silencing of the IR25a gene was confirmed by qPCR in experimental groups of knock-down copepodids (dsIR25a). Behavioural responses associated with host recognition were evaluated in dsIR25a sea lice after exposure to a peptide produced by the salmon host (Cath-2). The dsIR25a group decreased expression levels of IR25a by > 7-fold with respect to the control group. This group was also 26% slower than the control group (control swimming speed was 69 mm/s, while the treated group was 51 mm/s). Since the swimming activity of salmon lice copepodids is associated with the activation of the chemosensory system, these results indicate that the L. salmonis chemosensory perception system was not fully activated due to gene silencing. The results of this study demonstrate the role of ionotropic receptor 25a during host recognition by sea lice.

AB WDR1 is a major cofactor of the actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin, accelerating ADF/cofilin-mediated actin disassembly. We had previously showed that WDR1-mediated actin dynamics is required for postnatal myocardial growth and adult myocardial maintenance in mice, in which the detailed phenotypes of adult cardiomyocyte-specific Wdrl deletion mice had not been analyzed. In this study, we systematically analyzed the role of Wdrl in adult mouse heart. Adult cardiomyocyte-specific Wdrl deletion mice (cKO) exhibited cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis. Echocardiographic study and electrocardiography revealed impaired contractile function, prolonged QT interval and Tpeak-Tend interval, and abnormal T-wave amplitude in cKO mice. Increased levels of sarcomeric proteins, adherens junction proteins and cofilin, and severe actin filament (F-actin) accumulations were observed in cKO mice heart. Taken together, this finding demonstrates that WDR1 is a critical factor for normal structure and function of adult mouse heart.

AB Background: Autosomal recessive disorder is closely correlated with congenital fetal malformation. The mutation of WDR35 may lead to short rib-polydactyly syndrome (SRP), asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD, Jeune syndrome) and Ellis van Creveld syndrome. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of WDR35 in fetal anomaly.
   Results: The fetuses presented malformation with abnormal head shape, cardiac dilatation, pericardial effusion, and non-displayed left pulmonary artery and left lung. After the detection of genomic DNA (gDNA) in amniotic fluid cells (AFC), chromosomal rearrangement was found in arr[hg19] 2p25.3p23.3. It was revealed through multiple PCR-DHPLC that MYCN, WDR35, LPIN1, ODC1, KLF11 and NBAS contained duplicated copy numbers in 2p25.3p23.3. AF-MSCs were mostly positive for CD44, CD105, negative for CD34 and CD14. Western Blot test showed that WDR35-encoded protein was decreased in the patients' AFC compared to that in normal pregnant women. In the patients' amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AF-MSCs), WDR35 overexpression could repair cilia formation, and the overexpression of WDR35 or Gli2 could significantly enhance ALP activity and expressions of osteogenic differentiation marker genes, including RUNXE2, OCN, BSP and ALP. However, WDR35 silencing in C3H1OT1/2 cells could remarkably inhibit cilia formation and osteogenic differentiation. This inhibitory effect could be attenuated by Gli2 overexpression.
   Conclusions: The results demonstrated that copy number variation (CNV) of WDR35 may lead to skeletal dysplasia and fetal anomaly, and that down-regulated WDR35 may damage the cilia formation and sequentially indirectly regulate Gli signal, which would eventually result in negative regulation of osteogenic differentiation.

AB Oncogenes can potentially cause uncontrolled cell growth, leading to cancer development, and these genes are normally mutated and over-expressed in tumor cells. Genomic alteration of oncogenes might result in oncogenesis and promotion of cancer progression. To date, researchers have focused mainly on the roles of oncogenes in particular cancers, but investigation of oncogenes with gain-of-function mutations in multiple cancer types are less represented in the literature. Furthermore, the effect of those gain-of-function are not validated in gene expression level. To meet this demand, we performed a systematic analysis of gene expression in oncogenes to identify the occurrence of gain-of-function mutations in pan-cancer. We identified 33,551 oncogenic mutations in 5000 samples. From our analysis, we identified three tissues with the highest frequency of gain-of-functional oncogenic mutations in hundreds of samples: breast (739 samples), central nervous system (646 samples) and large intestine (498 samples). By further counting the number of occurrences of oncogenes across cancer types, we identified a list cross-cancer mutational signatures of 99 oncogenes highly mutated in > 400 samples in breast, central nervous system and large intestine samples. By further overlapping with gene expression data in the matched tumor samples, we further identified 1875 gain-of-functional mutations/events with consistent gene up-regulation in 1031 samples from multiple cancers. This result may offer additional insight into the relationship between gene dosage and oncogenesis and maybe useful in targeted cancer therapy. In summary, this study provides the first globally examining on the genetic alteration of oncogenes across cancer types. Clinical association analysis has shown that these 99 genes have a significant effect on survival.

AB Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative movement disorder that primarily results due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region. Studying gene expression in the substantia nigra region would potentially unravel disease-relevant protein-protein interactions.
   Methods: In this study we have used network science approach to prioritize candidate genes by focussing on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that interact with established PD associated-genes (PDAG). Prioritizing genes that interact with already established PDAG would reduce the probability of spurious protein-protein associations. The dataset GSE54282 with Parkinson's disease affected substantia nigra samples was extracted from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Protein-Protein Interaction Network (PPIN) was constructed by retrieving all possible interactions between DEGs from high-throughput experiments and literature data using Bisogenet. This complex PPIN was decomposed to construct a subnetwork of Parkinson's Disease-Protein Interaction Map (PD-PIM) by including PDAG and following well-established concepts of network biology such as degree and betweenness centrality. We then implemented a "two-way analysis" where we selected genes belonging to PDPIM subnetwork with their primary interacting partners and highly coexpressed genes on the basis of Pearson score.
   Results: A complex PPIN comprised of 5340 nodes (genes) and 39,199 edges (interactions) was obtained. A list of 205 genes (123 PDAGs, 69 hub genes and 13 bottleneck genes) with their respective first level interacting partners were extracted from PPIN interactome to build a PD-specific subnetwork, PD-PIM. This subnetwork PD-PIM comprised of 5078 nodes and 38,357 edges. We then employed a "two-way" gene prioritization method that delineated 267 genes of which 16 genes were found to intersect in the two networks of the "two-way analysis". Of the 16 genes, we narrowed down to 7 novel candidate genes (VCAM1, BACH1, CALM3, EGR1, IKBKE, MYC and YWHAG) displaying significant changes in their network interactions between control and disease samples. Interestingly, these genes were associated with neuroinflammation signaling pathway, MAPK signaling apoptosis pathway, movement disorders and development of neurons that are linked with development of PD.
   Conclusion: We propose that VCAM1, BACH1, CALM3, EGR1, IKBKE, MYC and YWHAG genes might play important roles in PD pathogenesis, as well as facilitate the development of effective targeted therapies. Our integrative and network based approach for finding therapeutic targets in genomic data could accelerate the identification of novel drug targets for Parkinson's disease.

AB Influenza has a negative sense, single-stranded, and segmented RNA. In the context of pandemic influenza research, most studies have focused on variations in the surface proteins (Hemagglutinin and Neuraminidase). However, new findings suggest that all internal and external proteins of influenza viruses can contribute in pandemic emergence, pathogenicity and increasing host range. The occurrence of the 2009 influenza pandemic and the availability of many external and internal segments of pandemic and non-pandemic sequences offer a unique opportunity to evaluate the performance of machine learning models in discrimination of pandemic from seasonal sequences using mutation positions in all segments. In this study, we hypothesized that identifying mutation positions in all segments (proteins) encoded by the influenza genome would enable pandemic and seasonal strains to be more reliably distinguished. In a large scale study, we applied a range of data mining techniques to all segments of influenza for rule discovery and discrimination of pandemic from seasonal strains. CBA (classification based on association rule mining), Ripper and Decision tree algorithms were utilized to extract association rules among mutations. CBA outperformed the other models. Our approach could discriminate pandemic sequences from seasonal ones with more than 95% accuracy for PA and NP, 99.33% accuracy for NA and 100% accuracy, precision, specificity and sensitivity (recall) for M1, M2, PB1, NS1, and NS2. The values of precision, specificity, and sensitivity were more than 90% for other segments except PB2. If sequences of all segments of one strain were available, the accuracy of discrimination of pandemic strains was 100%. General rules extracted by rule base classification approaches, such as M1-V1471, NP-N334H, NS1-V1121, and PB1-L3641, were able to detect pandemic sequences with high accuracy. We observed that mutations on internal proteins of influenza can contribute in distinguishing the pandemic viruses, similar to the external ones.

AB Background: The microRNAs (miRNAs) have been validated as prognostic markers in many cancers. The aim of this study was to identify new miRNA prognostic biomarkers in endometrial cancer (EC) and to develop an expression-based miRNA signature to provide survival risk prediction for EC patients.
   Methods: From TCGA database, the miRNA datasets of EC and clinical information were downloaded in April 2018. Using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses identify prognostic factors. Using area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve assess the sensitivity and specificity of prognostic model.
   Results: 530 patients were randomly divided into training set and testing set. Among 561 differentially expressed miRNAs, 4 miRNAs (miR-4758, miR-876, miR-142, miR-190b) were demonstrated to be predictive biomarkers of overall survival (OS) for EC patients in training set. Based on the risk score of 4-miRNA model, patients in the training set were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups with significantly different OS. This 4-miRNA model was validated in testing and entire set. The AUC for the ROC curves in the entire set was 0.704. Meanwhile, multivariate Cox regression combined with other traditional clinical parameters indicated that the 4-miRNA model can be used as an independent OS prognostic factor. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these miRNAs are involved in biological processes and pathways that are closely related to cancer.
   Conclusion: A robust 4-miRNA signature as an independent prognostic factor for OS in EC patients was established.

AB The pathogenesis and the underlying mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. LncRNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) is an oncogene in a variety of cancers. The role of PVT1 in HCC progression is not completely understood. In the present study, we conducted a series of studies to explore the role of PVT1 on autophagy in HCC cells. Our study found PVT1 levels were markedly up-regulated in the corresponding HCC tissues. Importantly, we found that PVT1 could facilitate cell autophagy in HCC cells. Then, we confirmed that the effect of PVT1 promoting autophagy was dependent on regulating ATG3 expression. Further investigations revealed that PVT1 could upregulate autophagy-related gene 3 (ATG3) expression by acting as an endogenous sponge of miR-365, which was an inhibitor gene on ATG3 protein by targeting 3'UTR of ATG3 mRNA. Moreover, rescue assays indicated that the effect of PVT1 on autophagy of HCC cells were dependent on miR-365. In conclusion, our study demonstrated PVT1 might be a key regulator participating in autophagy in HCC cells.
   We proved that PVT1 could promote autophagy as ceRNA by targeting miR-365.

AB HD-ZIP (Homeodomain leucine zipper) transcription factors play an important regulatory role in stress resistance in plants. The purpose of this study was to analyze the characteristics of the HD-ZIP genes/proteins and to study their expression profiles under high and low temperature conditions in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). A strict homology search was used to find 43 HD-ZIP genes located on potato chromosomes 1-12. Exons/introns, protein features and conserved motifs were analyzed, and six segment duplications were identified from 43 HD-ZIP genes. Then, we analyzed the data from the PGSC (Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium) database regarding the expression of 43 HD-ZIP genes that were induced by biotic and abiotic stresses and phytohormone treatments and conducted an expression analysis for these genes across all potato life stages. Additionally, the expression levels of 13 HD-ZIP genes were analyzed under high temperature (37 degrees C) and low temperature (4 degrees C) conditions. The results showed that the transcript levels of all 13 genes changed, which indicated that these genes respond to heat and cold in plants. Especially for StHOX20, the expression significantly upregulated in roots at 37 degrees C and 4 degrees C. Our findings laid the foundation and provided clues for understanding the biological functions of HD-ZIP family genes.

AB Causative mutations for familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) have been identified in the phospholamban gene. There are many poorly understood aspects about familial DCM (variable penetrance, expression) which may be studied in natural animal models.
   We characterized genetic aspects of familial DCM in a canine model with a high incidence of sudden death. A missense G > A mutation in exon 1 of the phospholamban gene that changed an amino acid from arginine to histidine was identified in affected dogs. This variant was predicted to be deleterious.
   We describe a spontaneous canine model of familial DCM and sudden death with the R9H mutation. In comparison to a reported human family, the variant was highly penetrant and resulted in sudden death. Genetic penetrance of this mutation may he influenced by genetic or environmental modifiers. The dog provides an excellent model in which to study complex aspects of familial DCM.

AB Haematococcus pluvialis is an economic microalga to produce astaxathin. To study the nitrogen metabolic process of H. pluvialis, the transcription level and enzyme content of nitrite reductase at different nitrate and phosphorus concentrations were studied. In this research, nitrite reductase gene (nir) was first cloned from H. pluvialis, which consists of 5592 nucleotides and includes 12 introns. The cDNA ORF is 1776 bp, encoding a 592 amino acid protein with two conserved domains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the nir gene in H. pluvialis had the highest affinity with other freshwater green algae. Nitrogen and phosphorus play an important role in the growth of H. pluvialis. The single factor experiments of nitrogen on growth conditions showed that the group with 0.2 g/L NaNO3 had a relative high biomass. The single factor experiments of phosphorus on growth conditions showed that the group with 0.06 g/L K2HPO4 had a relative high biomass. The transcription level and enzymatic activity of nitrite reductase were detected at different nitrate and phosphorus concentrations. In the absence of nitrogen and phosphorus in the medium, nitrite reductase activity is the highest. This research provides theoretical guidance for optimization of culture medium for H. pluvialis and also provides an experimental basis for understanding of nitrogen metabolism pathway in H. pluvialis.

AB Misuse of anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) increases prevalence of cardiovascular abnormalities in athletes, and the underlying molecular mechanism involved in those abnormalities continues to be investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of chronic nandrolone exposure on alpha and beta myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms gene expression transition, blood pressure related parameters, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinaseII delta (CaMKII delta), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) activities in rats' hearts. It was also planned to evaluate the effect of strenuous exercise on cardiac abnormalities induced by nandrolone. Thirty-two male wistar rats were assigned into four groups, namely control, nandrolone, nandrolone with strenuous exercise, and strenuous exercise groups. Nandrolone consumption significantly increased systolic, diastolic, pulse and dicrotic pressure, mean arterial pressure, as well as the amplitude of first peak (H1). Moreover, exercise combined with nandrolone completely masked this effect. The mRNA expression of beta-MHC and the ratio of beta-MHC/alpha-MHC showed a significant increase in the nandrolone and nandrolone with strenuous exercise groups compared to those in the control group. The values of heart tissue calcium/calmoldulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (CaMKII delta), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the nandrolone, nandrolone with strenuous exercise and exercise groups were significantly higher than those values in the control group.
   These findings indicate that nandrolone-induced heart and hemodynamic abnormalities may in part be associated with MHC isoform changes and Ca2+ homeostasis changes mediated by increased CaMKII delta and MAO activities and that these effects can be provoked via strenuous exercise.

AB In the present study, NF-kappa B inhibitor BAY 11-7082 and/or Hsp-27 inhibitor KRIBB-3 agents were used to investigate the molecular mechanisms mediating androgen receptor expression on prostate cancer cell lines. The decrease observed in androgen receptor and p65 expressions, particularly at 48 h, in parallel with the decrease in the phosphorylation of the p-IKK alpha/beta and p-Hsp-27 proteins in the LNCaP cells, indicated that androgen receptor inactivation occurred after the inhibition of the NF-kappa B and Hsp-27. In 22Rv1 cells, androgen receptor variant-7 was also observed to be decreased in the combined dose of 48 h. The association of this decrease with the decrease in androgen receptor and p65 expressions is a supportive result for the role of NF-kappa B signaling in the formation of androgen receptor variant. In androgen receptor variant-7 siRNA treatment in 22Rv1 cell lines, decrease of expression of androgen receptor variant-7 as well as decrease of expression of androgen receptor and p65 were observed. The decrease statistically significant in androgen receptor and p65 expressions was even greater when siRNA treatment was followed with low dose and time (6 h) combined treatment after transfection. We also showed that increased Noxa and decreased Bcl-2 protein level, indicated that apoptotic induction after this combination. In conclusion, inhibition of NF-kappa B and Hsp-27 is also important, along with therapies for androgen receptor variant-7 inhibition.

AB beta-1,3-Glucan recognition protein (beta GRP) is an important pattern recognition protein, which could trigger immune response to eliminate pathogens by identifying and combining the pathogenic bacteria. In the present study, a beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein gene (Ap beta GRP) was cloned from a desert beetle Anatolica polita based on the EST sequence of Ap beta GRP in the suppression subtractive cDNA library. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results showed that Ap beta GRP transcript in A. polita was significantly upregulated under the challenge of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Western blot analysis indicated that recombinant Ap beta GRP expressed in E. coli BL21, has the ability of binding to E. colt and S. aureus. Moreover, agglutination assay suggested that recombinant Ap beta GRP could agglutinate E. coli, S. aureus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The predicted 3D structure showed that Ap beta GRP possesses a typical beta-glucan recognition domain with seven beta-strands structures and conserved amino acid sequence. These data indicate that Ap beta GRP may be involved in immune defense in A. polita and could recognize and bind the bacteria against the invasion of external pathogens.

AB Neuron damage contributes to ischemic brain injury. Although FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) plays a critical role in neuron survival, its function and molecular mechanism in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury is unclear. In the present study, we exposed SH-SY5Y cells to oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) to mimic ischemia/reperfusion injury. We found that FLT3 and MAPK14/p38 alpha expression increased in OGD/R-treated cells. FLT3 silence significantly increased OGD/R-induced SH-SY5Y cell survival, inhibited reactive oxygen species production. Also, we observed that FLT3 silence suppressed OGD/R-induced SH-SY5Y cell apoptosis, apoptosis related protein Bax level and caspase-3 activity was decreased and Bcl-2 expression was increased in FLT3 silence SH-SY5Y cell treated with OGD/R. Furthermore, FLT3 depletion induced MAPK14/p38 alpha inhibition in SH-SY5Y cultures after OGD/R exposure. These findings suggest that MAPK14/p38 alpha over-expression reverses the action of FLT3 silence in OGD/R-induced SH-SY5Y cells. They also provide the first evidence that FLT3 silence has a neuroprotective role in OGD/R-induced SH-SY5Y cell damage. These data provide insight about potential neuroprotective molecular for ischemia/reperfusion injury.

   Splicing; Dropped head syndrome; Floppy head syndrome; Congenital

AB Mutations in the MYH7 gene are the source of an allelic series of diseases, including various cardiomyopathies and skeletal myopathies that usually manifest in adulthood. We observed a 1.5 y.o. male patient with congenital weaknesses of the axial muscles, "dropped head" syndrome, and dilated cardiomyopathy. The clinical evaluation included medical history, an echocardiogram, electromyography, and a histopathological study. The genetic evaluation included whole exome sequencing. Muscle biopsy samples from the proband were used for mRNA extraction. We revealed a novel genetic variant c.5655 + 5G > C in the MYH7 gene. The analysis of the cDNA showed an in-frame skipping of exon 38 (p.1854_1885del). This variant and two previously published mutations (c.5655G > A and c.5655 + 1G > A), also presumably leading to exon 38 skipping, were studied by expression analysis in the HEK293T cell line transfected with 4 plasmids containing the MYH7 minigene (wt, c.5655G > C, c.5655 + 1G > A and c.5655 + 5G > A). A quantitative difference in expression was shown for cell lines with each of the three mutant plasmids. All mutation carriers had a similar phenotype and included congenital axial myopathy and variable cardiac involvement. Prominent dropped head syndrome was mentioned in all patients. Early-onset axial myopathy with a dropped head syndrome is a distinct clinical entity within MYH7-related disorders. We suggest that mutations in the MYH7 gene affecting the C-terminal domain of beta-myosin heavy chain should also be considered as a possible cause in cases of early-onset myopathy with "dropped head" syndrome.

AB Background: This study aimed to investigate the impact of miR-451 on the biological behaviours of colon cancer cells along with its targets interactions.
   Method: The levels of miR-451 were tested in colon cancer cell lines (SW480 and SW48). Multiple functional and immunological assays were performed to analyse miR-451 induced growth changes in-vitro and downstream effects on target proteins.
   Results: Overexpression of miR-451 in colon cancer cells led to reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis and decrease accumulation of the cells at the GO/G1 phase of the cell cycle. In addition, a significant increase in the number of the cells was noted in the G2-M phase of cell cycle. Moreover, miR-451 reduced the expression of Oct-4, Sox-2 and Snail indicating its role in stem cell and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulation. An inverse correlation between miR-451 and macrophage migration inhibitory protein (MIF) protein expression occurred in colon cancer cells. Furthermore, restoration the level of miR-451 in colon cancer cells inhibits tumour spheres formation.
   Conclusion: miR-451 has tumour suppressor effects in vitro, which can inhibit the cancer-related signalling pathways in colon cancer.

AB Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI), a complex phenomenon often encountered in surgery, can lead to local and distant tissue destruction and sometimes even death. microRNA-203 (miR-203) has been reported to negatively regulate ischemia induced microglia activation with a feedback to myeloid differentiation primary-response gene 88 (MYD88). Accordingly, our study is to verify the effect of miR-203 and MYD88 on mice in IRI after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). After establishment of IRI mouse model, heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in mice were determined. The functional role of miR-203 in IRI was determined using ectopic expression, knockdown and reporter assay experiments. Levels of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin 10 (IL-10), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were detected, and expression of miR-203, MYD88, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), Faslg, Cleaved-Caspase-3, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) was evaluated. Initially, HR and MAP were decreased in IRI mice. Forced expression of miR-203 and silencing of MYD88 increased levels of SOD and IL-10 but decreased levels of MDA, CK, LDH, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IFN-gamma. Additionally, forced expression of miR-203 and silencing of MYD88 increased Bcl-2 expression but decreased MYD88, TLR4, Cleaved-Caspase-3, Falsg and Bax expression. MYD88, a target gene of miR-203, was decreased following miR203 promotion, while the TLR signaling pathway inactivation occurred following MYD88 silencing. Generally, our study demonstrated the protective effects of miR-203 on mice with IRI after TKA through inhibiting TLR signaling pathway by negatively regulating MYD88.

AB Backgrounds: The pathophysiology of hydrocephalus induced brain damage remains unclear. Long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) have been demonstrated to be implicated in many central nervous system diseases. However, the roles of IncRNAs in hydrocephalus injury are poorly understood.
   Methods: The present study depicted the expression profiles of lncRNAs and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in C57BL/6 mice with kaolin-induced hydrocephalus and saline controls using high-throughput RNA sequencing. Afterward, Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed to identify potential targets that correlated with hydrocephalus. In addition, co-expression networks and cis- and trans-regulation were predicted using bioinformatics methods. Finally, representative lncRNAs and mRNAs were further validation using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
   Results: A total of 1575 lncRNAs and 1168 mRNAs were differentially expressed (DE) in hydrocephalus. GO and KEGG analyses indicated several immune and inflammatory response-associated pathways may be important in the hydrocephalus. Besides, functional enrichment analysis based on co-expression network showed several similar pathways, such as chemokine signaling pathway, phagosome, MAPK signaling pathway and complement and coagulation cascade. Cis-regulation prediction revealed 5 novel lncRNAs might regulate their nearby coding genes, and trans-regulation revealed several IncRNAs participate in pathways regulated by transcription factors, including BPTF, FOXM1, NR5A2, P2RX5, and NR6A1.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, our results provide candidate genes involved in hydrocephalus and suggest a new perspective on the modulation of lncRNAs in hydrocephalus.

AB Fish cell lines are known to be immortal and do not show the signs of cellular senescence despite the absence of transformation. Furthermore, high telomerase activities responsible for maintenance of telomere length are detected in many organs in live fish, irrespective of fish age. On the other hand, although it is reported that cytosine methylation at CpG island shores decreases as zebrafish age, the relationship between DNA methylation and cellular senescence in fish has not been explored. In this study, we investigated the induction of cellular senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in a fathead minnow Pimephales promelas immortal cell line, Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) treated with the DNA demethylating agent 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC). DNA demethylation by 10 mu M of 5-Aza-dC caused cell growth arrest, morphological senescence-like phenotypes and induction of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) activity, likely due to a mitotic catastrophe caused by disruption of chromosome segregation. Furthermore, RT-qPCR analyses revealed significant up-regulation of senescence markers such as p53-p21 and p16-Rb pathways as well as several SASP factors in 5-Aza-dC treated cells. Meanwhile, although DNA demethylation suppressed the transcription of myc and its downstream target, telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert), telomerase activity was no more than modestly decreased. These results suggest that although DNA methylation may be involved in the suppression of cellular senescence, it not critical for the immortalization of the fish cell line.

AB MicroRNA-3099 is highly expressed during neuronal differentiation and development of the central nervous system. Here we characterised the role of miR-3099 during neural differentiation and embryonic brain development using a stable and regulatable mouse embryonic stem cell culture system for miR-3099 expression and in utero electroporation of miR-3099 expression construct into E15.5 embryonic mouse brains. In the in vitro system, miR-3099 overexpression upregulated gene related to neuronal markers such as Tuj1, NeuN, Gat1, vGluT1 and vGluT2. In contrast, gene related to astrocyte markers (Gfap, swop and Slcla3) were suppressed upon over expression of miR-3099. Furthermore, miR-3099 overexpression between E15.5 and E18.5 mouse embryonic brains led to disorganised neuronal migration potentially due to significantly decreased Gfap + cells. Collectively, our results indicated that miR-3099 plays a role in modulating and regulating expression of key markers involved in neuronal differentiation. In silica analysis was also performed to identify miR-3099 homologues in the human genome, and candidates were validated by stem-loop RT-qPCR. Analysis of the miR-3099 seed sequence AGGCUA against human transcriptomes revealed that a potential miRNA, mds21 (Chr21:39186698-39186677) (GenBank accession ID: MK521584), was 100% identical to the miR-3099 seed sequence. Mds21 expression was observed and validated in various human cell lines (293FT, human Wharton's jelly and dental pulp mesenchymal stem cells, and MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, C-Sert, SW780, RT112, 5637, EJ28 and SH-SY5Y cells), with the highest levels detected in human mesenchymal stem cell lines. The analysis validated mds21 as a novel miRNA and a novel homologue of miR-3099 in the human genome.

AB Strabismus refers to the misalignment of the eyes and occurs in 2-4% of individuals. The low-resolution label "strabismus" covers a range of heterogeneous defects, which makes it challenging to unravel this condition. Consequently a coherent understanding of the causes is lacking. Here, we attempt to gain a better understanding of the underlying genetics by combining gene curation, diverse bioinformatic analyses (including gene ontology, pathway mapping, expression and network-based methods) and literature review. Through a phenotype-based curation process, we identify high-confidence and permissive sets of 54 and 233 genes potentially involved in strabismus. These genes can be grouped into 10 modules that together span a heterogeneous set of biological and molecular functions, and can be linked to clinical sub-phenotypes. Multiple lines of evidence associate retina and cerebellum biology with the strabismus genes. We further highlight a potential role of the Ras-MAPK pathway. Independently, sets of 11 genes and 15 loci tied to strabismus with definitive genetic basis have been compiled from the literature. We identify strabismus candidate genes for 5 of the 15 reported loci (CHD7; SLC9A6; COL18A1, COL6A2; FRY, BRCA2, SPG20; PARK2). Finally, we synthesize a Strabismus Candidate Gene Collection, which together with our curated gene sets will serve as a resource for future research. The results of this informatics study support the heterogeneity and complexity of strabismus and point to specific biological pathways and brain regions for future focus.

TI Multi-network approach to identify differentially methylated gene

   Differential gene methylation; Multi-network
AB Background and objective: High-throughput Next Generation Sequencing tools have generated immense quantity of genome-wide methylation and expression profiling data, resulting in an unprecedented opportunity to unravel the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying cancer. Identifying differentially methylated regions within gene networks is an important step towards revealing the cancer epigenome blueprint. Approaches that integrate gene methylation and expression profiles assume their negative correlation and build a single scaffold network to cluster. However, the exact regulatory mechanism between gene expression and methylation is not precisely deciphered.
   Methods: A consensus-based clustering framework, namely, Differentially Methylated Gene Communities based on Multi-network (DMGC-M) is proposed, that takes multiple gene networks as input and builds a community structure out of evidences from all network types.
   Results: Experiments on six cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reveal that multi-network approaches produce more discriminative gene communities than integrated approaches.
   Conclusion: The proposed method will be useful to a number of researchers who seek to identify epigenetic dysregulations in pathways or molecular networks. The findings can also advance recent research efforts in Molecular Pathologic Epidemiology.

AB At a workshop on 7-8 November 2018 the leaders of 26 advanced vaccinology courses met to carry out an extensive review of the existing courses worldwide, in order to identify education gaps and future needs and discuss potential collaboration. The main conclusions of the workshop concerned: opportunities for strengthening and expanding the global coverage of vaccinology training; evaluation of vaccinology courses; updating knowledge after the course; how to facilitate post-course 'cascade' training; developing and sharing best practices; the application of online and innovative approaches in adult education; and how to reduce costs and facilitate wider access to vaccinology training. The importance of collaboration and information exchange through networks of alumni and between courses was stressed. A web platform to provide information about existing courses for potential applicants is needed. Lack of sustainable funding is a constraint for vaccinology training and needs to be addressed.

AB Maternal immunization provides an excellent evidence-based strategy for preventing severe disease and decreasing neonatal and infant mortality. A substantial proportion of these deaths are due to infectious diseases, most of them vaccine-preventable, then, there is a real opportunity for intervention.
   Maternal immunization has been an underexploited area for many years, with the exception of neonatal tetanus. There are now programs for influenza and acellular pertussis vaccination in many countries and two maternal vaccine targets under development are focused on decreasing the burden of infant respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Group B Streptococcus (GBS). Bodies like the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization established by the WHO, the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, have recognized the relevance of maternal immunization on several occasions. However, why is the field not moving faster, as one might expect?
   Major initiatives and programs should consider spelling out more clearly the role and benefits of this intervention and calling for specific actions, including future strategic approaches for the post 2020 immunization strategy following the GVAP; and single out the area as one of its priorities as a key component of immunization across the life course. While waiting for the new vaccines like RSV and GBS and optimizing the use of influenza and pertussis there is momentum now to coordinate efforts, address the missing information and action gaps, and call to accelerate progress.

AB Vertical transmission from mother-to-child is an important mode of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, accounting for up to half of all incident cases globally. We evaluated the uptake of HBV neonatal vaccination and immunoglobulin delivery in Queensland, Australia, between 2001 and 2013. We identified HBV-positive mothers using linked notifiable conditions, hospitalisation, and perinatal administrative data. Perinatal receipt of monovalent HBV vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin were examined. Of 710,859 live births, with 5753 infants (0.81%) born to identified HBV-positive mothers; 91.7% received HBV neonatal vaccine. Immunoglobulin uptake was 20.0% in 2012 and 36.6% in 2013. Uptake was higher when the mother's HBV-positive status was recorded in perinatal records (69.6% if maternal HBV status recorded on perinatal data collection vs 9.5% otherwise). Delivery of neonatal HBV vaccination in Queensland was high. Improved identification and documentation of HBV-positive mothers' status during the antenatal period was associated with increased immunoglobulin administration. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

ID VACCINATION
AB In 2013, following the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW)'s announced suspension of its vaccine recommendation due to media reports of "adverse events", HPV vaccination dropped to almost 0%. Here, we analyzed, by birth year, the cumulative vaccinations for girls up to age 16 (maximum age for public subsidies) and the results of cervical cancer screening in Matsuyama City. The incidence of CIN3 or worse was 0.09% (7/7872) for these unvaccinated generation born between 1991 and 1993, and 0.00% (0/7389) for the vaccination generation born between 1994 and 1996. This study is the first to show the significant reduction in incidence of CIN3+depending on birth year in Japan. We must keep in mind that the unacceptable high risk for cervical cancer has already begun for an entire new generation of unvaccinated girls born in or after 2000. This data encourages a resumption of MHLWs recommendation for HPV vaccination. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Variation in rotavirus vaccination coding in state US Medicaid data
SO VACCINE

DT Article
DE Claims data; Immunization; Observational research; Medicaid; Rotavirus;
   Real-world data
ID COMPLETION
AB Differences in state Medicaid policies and practices may result in variation in the recording of individual level vaccination claims, which may present challenges for vaccination research using state Medicaid data. We describe differences in procedure coding for rotavirus vaccination in four states' Medicaid programs by identifying rotavirus vaccine-specific codes and oral vaccine administration codes. The proportion of vaccinated children with vaccine-specific and oral vaccine administration codes differed substantially across states: two states used vaccine-specific codes almost exclusively (95.9% and 99.0%); one had exclusively oral vaccine administration codes (>99.9%); another had a mixture (32.1% vaccine-specific codes, 40.0% oral vaccine administration codes, and 27.9% both). Depending on the research question, studies using Medicaid data in states without (or with incomplete) vaccine-specific coding may be infeasible. Prior to initiating research, investigators should carefully evaluate state Medicaid policies and patterns of vaccination uptake, as vaccine reimbursement policies and availability of vaccine claims may vary.

AB Background: We estimated the relative efficacy and safety of vaccines for prevention of herpes zoster (HZ) using network meta-analysis (NMA) based on evidence from randomized controlled trials.
   Methods: A systematic literature review evaluated two different HZ vaccines: adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) and zoster vaccine live (ZVL), with different formulations assessed. Detailed feasibility assessment indicated that a NMA was feasible for efficacy (incidence of HZ and postherpetic neuralgia [PHN]) and safety (serious adverse events [SAE] and reactogenicity [injection-site reactions, systemic reaction]) outcomes. Primary analyses included frequentist NMAs with fixed effects for efficacy outcomes, due to limited data availability, and both fixed and random effects for safety and reactogenicity outcomes. As age is a known effect modifier of vaccine efficacy (VE), VE analyses were stratified by age.
   Results: RZV demonstrated significantly higher HZ efficacy than ZVL in adults >= 60 years of age (YOA) (VERZV = 0.92 (95% confidence interval [95%Cl]: 0.88, 0.94), VEZVL = 0.51 (95%Cl: 0.44, 0.57)) and adults >= 70 YOA (VERZV = 0.91 (95%Cl: 0.87, 0.94), VEZVL = 0.37 (95%Cl: 0.25, 0.48)). Similarly, RZV demonstrated significantly higher PHN efficacy than ZVL in adults >= 60 YOA (VERZV = 0.89 (95%Cl: 0.70, 0.96), VEZVL = 0.66 (95%Cl: 0.48, 0.78)) and adults >= 70 YOA (VERZV = 0.89 (95%Cl: 0.69, 0.96), VEZVL = 0.67 (95%Cl: 0.44, 0.80)). RZV was associated with significantly more injection-site and systemic reactions compared to most formulations of ZVL and placebo, however definitions and data collection procedures differed across the included studies. There were no statistically significant differences found between RZV and any formulation of ZVL or placebo for SAES.
   Conclusion: RZV is significantly more effective in reducing HZ and PHN incidence in adults >= 60 YOA, compared with ZVL. As anticipated with an adjuvanted vaccine, RZV results in more reactogenicity following immunization. No differences in SAES were found between RZV and ZVL. (C) 2019 GlaxoSmithKline SA.

ID CHALLENGES; STANDARDS
AB The recent approval of multiple new vaccines and their introduction in many Gavi countries have been the impetus for efforts to reduce the costs of these vaccines. In this paper, we provide an overview of the main cost drivers for bringing second generation vaccines and compares these, where relevant, to the cost of bringing generic medicines to market. We argue that the main cost drivers for vaccine development are fixed, implying that second-generation vaccines do not lead to the same price reduction as normally seen with generic drugs. Lastly, we provide recommendations of the areas within vaccine development that could support further cost reductions. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is causally linked to the development of several human cancers, including cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancers. To address the need for a therapeutic vaccine against HPV-associated diseases, here we test and compare the immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy of a bacterial exotoxin fusion protein covalently linked to the HPV16 E7 oncoprotein adjuvanted with CpG or GPI-0100 in the C3.43 preclinical HPV16-transformed tumor model. We show that TVGV-1 protein vaccine adjuvanted with either CpG or GPI-0100 adjuvant induces a high frequency of E7-specific CD8(+) T cells, and both adjuvants are able to assist the immune response in inducing polyfunctional cytokine-secreting lytic T cells that show therapeutic efficacy against well-established C3.43 tumors. CpG-adjuvanted TVGV-1 resulted in higher frequencies of IFN gamma secreting and degranulating E7-specific T cells compared to GPI-0100-adjuvanted TVGV-1, resulting in marginally increased in vivo efficacy. Despite minor differences in immune response outcomes, we consider both CpG ODN and GPI-0100 to be promising vaccine adjuvants to increase the immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy of the TVGV-1 protein for HPV16-driven cancers.

AB Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children under one year of age. In addition to causing severe respiratory diseases in children, it is also a major cause of morbidity and mortality among the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. RSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections, yet there are currently no licensed vaccines. A parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5)-based amplifying virus-like particle (AVLP), which enables the use of PIV5 RNA transcription/replication machinery to express gene of interest, has recently been developed. We evaluated the PIV5-based AVLP system as a vaccine platform for RSV by incorporating the fusion protein (F) gene and the transcription factor protein (M2-1) gene of RSV into the PIV5-AVLP backbone (AVLP-F and AVLP-M2-1, respectively). Mice immunized with a single dose of the AVLP-F or AVLP-M2-1 developed RSV-F or RSV-M2-1-specific immune responses, respectively. Both vaccine candidates elicited antigen-specific cell-mediated responses at levels comparable to or higher than an RSV infection. Most importantly, each vaccine was able to induce protection against RSV A2 challenge in the mouse model. These results indicate the potential of the PIV5-based AVLP system as a platform for vaccines against RSV infection. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines reduce the incidence of invasive pneumococcal diseases, pneumonia, acute otitis media (AOM), and antimicrobial prescriptions in children. We investigated the effectiveness of at least one dose of the ten-valent pneumococcal Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV10; GSK) against respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children under two years of age.
   Methods: 424 children enrolled in a cluster-randomized, double-blind Finnish Invasive Pneumococcal disease (FinIP) vaccine trial during the years 2009-2010 were actively followed in a prospective cohort study (STEPS study) for RTIs from birth to two years of age. Children received the PHiD-CV10 vaccine, or a control vaccine (hepatitis A or B vaccine) according to an age-specific schedule. Data on RTIs were collected by symptom diaries, clinic visits, an electronic registry on hospitalizations, and by nasal swab samples analyzed for respiratory viruses. We estimated the vaccine effectiveness against all RTI episodes and RTI episodes with or without AOM by comparing the corresponding incidence rates between PHiD-CV10-vaccinated and control children, adjusted for presence of siblings and cluster as a random effect.
   Results: A total of 3193 RTI episodes were documented after the first vaccination in 368 children with all data available. The majority of the illnesses were upper RTIs caused by rhinovirus. The PHiD-CV10-vaccinated children had lower mean annual rates of all RTI episodes (6.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.0-6.8) and RTI episodes with AOM (1.0; 95% CI, 0.9-1.2) as compared to the control children (7.4; 95% CI, 6.8-8.0 and 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.6, respectively). The vaccine effectiveness was 12% (95% CI, 2-22%) against all
   Conclusions: Vaccination with PHiD-CV10 resulted in lower rates of RTIs in children under two years of age compared to children vaccinated with control vaccine. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) are female community health workers whose primary role is to promote utilization of primary healthcare services and improve sanitation in rural areas and are financially incentivized for services provided. Prior studies evaluating ASHAs have been largely qualitative, and assess their knowledge, skills, and practice. Globally, there have been very few studies that have quantitatively assessed community health workers. We analyzed the cost effectiveness of ASHAs in facilitating measles vaccination among children under 5 years during 2012-2013.
   Methods: We utilized Markov modeling simulating a cohort of children in villages with and without ASHAs. We extrapolated the health states to a lifetime of 68 years to estimate the effects of ASHA intervention. Measles vaccination rates were obtained from 2013 District Level Household and Facilities Survey 4. Other parameter estimates were obtained from a review of relevant literature.
   Results: ASHA intervention was highly cost effective at $162 per DALY averted compared to no ASHA and remained cost effective with the ASHA incentive increased from $2 to $15, across the range of probabilities and cost parameters. Analyses were sensitive to probability of death due to childhood pneumonia, susceptibility to measles after one dose measles vaccine, and probability of pneumonia after measles infection.
   Conclusion: ASHAs were cost-effective under a wide range of scenarios even when a single health outcome such as measles vaccination was considered. The Government of India and individual state governments of India should consider increasing the incentives provided to ASHAs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB CD8+ T cells are known to control infections, but their role in preventing latent infection from establishing has not been thoroughly investigated.
   We hypothesized that a potent CD8+ T cell response patrolling the mucosal viral entry points could kill the first infected cells and thereby abrogate the infection before latency is established.
   To investigate this, replication deficient adenovirus serotype 5 vectors encoding murine gamma-herpesvirus-68 CD8+ T cell epitopes linked to the T cell adjuvant Invariant chain, were developed. We show that intranasal vaccination of mice reduces the risk of establishment of latent infection from multiple intranasal ID50 challenges with murine gamma-herpesvirus-68 by 81% per exposure at 14 days post vaccination. Protection waned over time, but immune responses were extended by heterologous prime-boost vaccination applied simultaneously intramuscularly and intranasally, and animals vaccinated 66 days prior to challenge showed a strong trend of long-term protection.
   Our data provides evidence that CD8+ T cells are able to protect against establishment of latent infection. Although the protective efficacy is difficult to maintain over time, this proof-of-concept study suggests a role for a CD8+ T cell arm in future vaccine strategies against latent human viral infections caused by pathogens such as HIV and multiple herpes virus.

AB Potency assays for vaccine products are an important regulatory requirement, and are used to assess product quality and consistency prior to lot release for clinical testing. Ideally they measure an established correlate of efficacy or protection. In cases where there is no known correlate of protection, however, a functional assay that measures a biological response to a vaccine can be applied as a potency assay. Here we describe an in vitro assay which quantitatively measures human T cell activation as a biological response to the TB vaccine candidate H4-IC31. The Cytokine Secretion Assay (CSA) is based on the ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-vaccinated human donor to process and respond to H4-IC31. The ability of H4-IC31 to stimulate a cellular immune response is measured through the quantification of secreted IFN'y and is reported as relative stimulatory activity (RSA) compared to an in-house reference standard. The CSA is specific to the H4-IC31 vaccine, determines the RSA of H4-IC31 in the range of 50% to 150% of the reference standard, and is stability indicating as it detects differences in RSA between intact and heat treated H4-IC31. Although the CSA does not provide a link to clinical efficacy, it fulfills the critical requirements for a biological potency test to assess TB vaccine candidates and can be used along with biochemical and immunochemical assays to define a product profile during clinical development, while eliminating the use of animals for product testing.

AB Background: A globally standardized approach in high and low and middle-income countries (LMIC) to actively monitor the safety of vaccines for pregnant women during development and implementation phases is critical. Brighton Collaboration's (BC) Global Alignment of Immunization Safety Assessment in Pregnancy (GALA) project has developed globally standardized case definitions (CDs) of key obstetric and neonatal terms for the assessment of safety of vaccines in pregnancy. CDs are categorized into levels of diagnostic certainty, facilitating their use in varied settings. This study evaluates the field performance of CDs in LMIC.
   Methods: Data from pregnant participants of RCTs for trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine conducted at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, South Africa (SA) between 2011 and 2013 were reviewed retrospectively for preterm birth, stillbirth and hypertension CDs and the Gestational age assessment (GA) algorithm. Data from an ongoing pneumococcal vaccine trial (conducted at MRC Unit, The Gambia) were collected prospectively for GA.
   Results: For GA, 600 mother-infant dyads from Gambia and 155 mother-infant dyads from SA were reviewed. Level 2B (unsure LMP and US in 2nd trimester) was the most common level seen in Gambia (63%) and level 3B1 (unsure LMP with physical examination) in SA (43%). Preterm deliveries had similar results in SA. The pregnancy-induced hypertension definition performed well, with 96% (54/56) of cases fulfilling 'level 1' for 'preeclampsia with severe features'. 24 stillbirths were identified and 21 records were reviewed; 73.3% (11/15) of the stillbirths classified as antepartum by attending physicians and 83.3% (5/6) of the intrapartum stillbirths did not fulfil the criteria for any level of certainty.
   Conclusion: BC CDs for neonatal and maternal outcomes (preterm and hypertension) and GA were sensitive, reliable and feasible to use in RCTs in SA and Gambia. Modifications to the stillbirth CD are required to improve its usefulness in varied settings. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fossils are critical for understanding the uplift history of the Tibetan Plateau and its impact on the diversity and diversification of living organisms in Eurasia. However, well-preserved fossils, especially plant megafossils are rare in the plateau. In this paper, we describe two species of Koelreuteria, namely K. lunpolaensis sp. nov. and K. miointegrifoliola, based on exquisitely preserved capsular valves from the late Oligocene of the Lunpola Basin, central Tibet. Koelreuteria lunpolaensis is distinguishable from all extant and fossil species of the genus in the strongly asymmetric form of the capsular valves, the emarginate or lobed apex of the valves, and zigzag lateral veins that are tapering towards the margin of the valves, and is considered to represent an extinct lineage of the genus. Koelreuteria miointegrifoliola is most similar to K. bipinnata-type group of extant Koelreuteria. The diverse Koelreuteria confirms a warm and humid environment with a low elevation in central Tibet during the late Oligocene based on their modem distributions. Fossil evidence indicates that the Tibetan Plateau was a center for diversity and diversification of Koelreuteria in the Oligocene/Miocene. It also suggests that Tibet might also serve as a refugium for the K. bipinnata-type group in the late Oligocene.

AB Buildings consumed 40% of the energy in the United States, which is more than any other sectors of the U.S. economy, including transportation and industry. The majority of this energy was used for lighting, space heating, cooling, ventilation, and water heating in the buildings. It is well known that the carbon emission is proportional to the energy consumption. Enhancing building efficiency becomes one of the easiest, most immediate and most cost-effective ways to reduce carbon emissions. This paper focuses on the simulation -based nationwide energy savings analysis of different energy conservation measures (ECMs) to enhance building energy performance. The study includes 44 different ECMs, which were simulated in 16 different climate zones for 11 different commercial building types in the U.S. Simulations were conducted using a whole building simulation program, EnergyPlus. Commercial prototype building models from the U.S. Department of Energy [1] were used as the baselines. Model input files were automatically modified to incorporate with 44 different ECMs using scripts. The baselines were based on American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) [2] Standard 90.1 and International Energy Conservation Code (IECC). A total of 15,488 simulations were conducted to study the nationwide energy savings potentials. The details of these 44 proposed ECMs and their corresponding nationwide saving potentials are presented and discussed in this paper.

AB This study examines the possibility of using plastic film waste presented in municipal solid waste as a fuel. There is a large amount of this waste that is currently not treated and ends up in landfills aggravating the global problem of marine and land pollution. A pyrolysis process was performed on this plastic waste to obtain a liquid fuel. For this, an experimental design was carried out, varying the operating conditions. The physical and chemical characteristics of the fuel, such as liquid fraction yield and higher calorific value, were determined and a statistical analysis has been carried out using polynomial and neural fuzzy models. In all the adjustments an r(2) greater than 0.95 was obtained and the neural fuzzy model fit the experimental data better than the polynomial model. The optimum operating conditions for the production of this oil are: a temperature of 500 degrees C, a residence time of 120 min, and 20 degrees C/min of heating rate.

AB Mode switching is essential in a unitized regenerative fuel cell system. The switching of electricity, reactants, and reversible electrochemical reactions occurs, thereby affecting cell performance. During model switching, insufficient reactant supply may cause severe concentration, especially along the width of the catalyst layer which is not currently considered in a low-dimensional model. To fill this gap, a three-dimensional simulation in a proton exchange membrane unitized regenerative fuel cell is performed and validated to investigate the dynamic responses of current density and mass transfer. Results certify that reductions on current density and hydrogen generation are severe, as the cell is switched to a high electrolysis voltage. The analysis of species transfer along the width of the porous layers indicates that the deterioration is attributed to the occurrence of serious concentration polarization which is caused by the severe local water starvation on the catalyst layer, especially below the rib. A high inlet velocity for reactant and low fuel cell voltage are conducive for remitting local water starvation to improve cell performance effectively. However, a slight deterioration cannot be avoided completely before the water supply arrives, which is limited by the high rates of electrochemical reactions at a high electrolysis voltage.

AB This work investigates energetically and financially a building solar cooling system with radiant walls which includes phase change materials (PCMs). The examined building has a floor area of 100 m(2) and it is located in Athens (Greece). The solar cooling system includes evacuated tube collectors coupled to a single-effect absorption chiller for producing cold water for the building radiant walls. The use of PCM is examined in all the building's outer walls and different scenarios with PCM in only some walls are also investigated in details. Different combinations of collecting areas and storage tank volumes are examined in order to determine the optimum design for every scenario. The study is performed with the commercial software TRNSYS which uses an active layer to simulate the radiant wall. The most important calculated parameters of this work are the auxiliary energy consumption, the solar coverage and the indoor temperature of the building. The results indicate that the best location of PCM layer is in south wall with a reduction of the auxiliary energy 30%, an increase of the solar coverage 3.8% and a reduction of the total system cost of about 3%.

AB The Stirling refrigerator, as an important type of Stirling machine, is widely used in both civil area and space technology. However, many of the existing models of the Stirling refrigerator are compatible with one specific type, and there is usually a contradiction between reflecting the reality accurately and giving an analytical solution. Based on the thermoacoustic theory, it is assumed that the acoustic inertance, the acoustic compliance, the flow resistance in the regenerator and the thermodynamic process in the working spaces are the major factors that affect the overall performance of the Stirling refrigerator. Therefore, by adopting the transmission line model and the polytrophic process equation, this paper proposed a general model which is applicable to various types of Stirling refrigerators and is able to give analytical solutions that can reveal some basic principles. By comparison, the simplified cases of the general model is found to be equivalent to some of the existing models, and a good agreement is achieved among the general model, the experiment and a Stirling refrigerator simulation software, which verifies the general model as well as the principles revealed by the analytical solutions. Applicable to various types of Stirling refrigerators, the general model is able to reflect the reality in a satisfactory way and provide an approach to parametrically explore the behavior of Stirling refrigerators with the analytical solutions, which will benefit the optimization of the thermal efficiency.

AB Biomass has been widely recognized as a sustainable fuel for balancing energy systems with high amounts of varying renewable energy production, mainly from wind or solar power. Combined heat and power (CHP) is an efficient technology for biomass utilization and energy system balancing. Currently, the increasing amount of renewable power production often reduces the price of electricity, which makes CHP plants uneconomical. However, this might not be the case in the future, when the subsidies for developing renewable energy sources are reduced or removed. This paper presents a feasibility analysis of the potential for operational flexibility in a bio-fueled CHP plant in a real-life environment using a spreadsheet model. Three different renewable power production schemes for the Aland Islands were analyzed: the present system, a balanced scenario and a high wind scenario. The analysis was conducted for three different-sized CHP plants run in modes which followed either the heat or the power load. Moreover, in one case two more parameters affecting the magnitude and rate of the flexibility were thoroughly examined: the start-up time and the minimum plant load.
   The results showed that biomass does have a place in future energy systems, and the spreadsheet tool can effectively be used for a CHP feasibility assessment in different operational environments; both for existing CHP plants and for planning new investments. The results indicate that the availability of inexpensive fuel and sufficient income from heat sales have to be secured as the operational environment of the CHP plant changes. The examination of the operational mode revealed that in the power-following mode, where the CHP plant can offer flexibility services, the plant's profitability depends on the rate of compensation for the excess heat or spinning hours.

AB Cadmium (Cd) stress is a cost-effective, clean, and environmentally friendly approach for microalgal lipid production and wastewater treatment. To study the regulatory networks involved in the growth and development of microalgae, the relationship between calcium and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signalling in the regulation of cell growth and lipid biosynthesis and Cd biosorption after Cd treatment were analysed. The highest lipid content (52.78%) and productivity (96.75 mg L-l d(-1)) were enhanced by 1.59- and 1.39-fold in algal cells treated with 80 mu M and 40 mu M Cd, respectively, compared to the control. The protein content, ROS, antioxidases, Ca2+ and lipid biosynthetic gene transcription levels were upregulated by Cd induction. Additionally, the results indicated that increased endogenous Ca2+ could alleviate oxidative stress by activating antioxidases and mediating Cd biosorption, resulting in cell growth modulation and lipid accumulation. These results demonstrated that Cd stress is a useful strategy for lipid production and Cd bioaccumulation in micro algae and that there is vital interaction between ROS and Ca2+ levels in the regulation of lipid accumulation under Cd stress.

AB This paper establishes an empirical correlation based on the separability of thermodynamic cycle, which could characterize the thermodynamic performance of organic Rankine cycle (ORC), resembling heat transfer empirical correlation. In this research, we found that the thermal efficiency, exergy efficiency and net output power of ORC can be expressed by the heat source characteristics (T-hs, heat source temperature) and two key physical properties of working fluids (T-cri, critical temperature; omega, acentric factor). That is, Omega(ORC,opt) = C-wf.T-cri(m).omega(n)(wf).T-hs(o).Taking subcritical ORC as an example, the empirical correlation of the optimal power generation and its corresponding optimal evaporation temperature could be provided through proposed method. The results reveal that the empirical correlations have the high prediction accuracies (the determination coefficient R-2 are both about 0.97) when comparing with traditional numerical calculation. The application of correlation could avoid the complex process of iteration for calculation convergence and calling properties, so it is more convenient and faster than traditional methods when used to predict the performance of ORC or to select and design the working fluids.

AB This study analyzes a new renewable energy-based multigeneration system, in which the energy sources are efficiently utilized to generate several useful commodities such as hydrogen, oxygen, desalted water, and refrigeration along with electricity. Osmotic power from desalination brine solution is harvested to contribute to the electricity generation and to reduce the environmental impact of brine. The system units are concentrated photovoltaics/thermal (CPVT), wind turbines, thermal energy storage (TES), hydrogen electrolyzes, hydrogen fuel cell, multistage flash (MSF) distillation, vapor compression refrigeration (VCR) cycle, and pressure retarded osmosis (PRO). The energetic and exergetic performance of the overall system, as well as the system units, are calculated based on the first and second law of thermodynamics. Further, a comprehensive parametric study is conducted to investigate the effect of varying environmental and operational conditions, and the input parameters on the production rate, exergy destruction rate and efficiencies. For maintaining the high efficiency of CPV operation, the heat generated on photovoltaic (PV) cells is dissipated by an effective cooling system. This heat is then stored in the TES to be further utilized in desalination. The TES is used for eliminating energy fluctuations in the system and for a continuous operation by storing the energy for the time, when energy from the sun is not available. The electricity from CPV and wind power is used in the VCR cycle and hydrogen electrolysis. The fuel cell can be operated during the time of peak electricity demand. After performing thermodynamic analysis over the system, the overall energy and exergy efficiencies are determined as 73.3% and 30.6%, respectively. The exergy destruction rates of the components are specified. In brief, generation of multiple commodities is assured based on a clean operation by a novel integration of multiple clean energy sources in one system.

AB Without fabricating intermediate tunnel junctions or wafer bonding schemes for interconnecting the subcells, heterojunction bipolar transistor solar cells offer a promising new route in solar energy conversion. In this work, an improved theory for the three -terminal heterojunction bipolar transistor solar cell is presented with inclusion of non -ideal effects missing from the previous treatment, namely the non -radiative recombination and the thermal conduction losses that are inevitably present in realistic devices. Following detailed balance theory, the revised analytical formula for the cell conversion efficiency is derived, and the maximum efficiencies under different conditions are further calculated. Under the condition of 100 sun irradiance and 50% injection efficiency, a Gallium arsenide/Gallium antimonide-based solar cell operating at 465 K yields a maximum efficiency of 46.4%. Moreover, the effects of solar concentration, injection efficiency, and other key parameters on the cell performance are analyzed, and, consequently, optimal operating conditions and limiting factors on the conversion efficiency are determined. Simulation results show that such a solar cell operating with low injection efficiency under moderate concentration factor and low cell temperature can significantly boost its conversion performance. This work provides new physical insights for optimal designs, thus paving a route towards the development of low-cost high-performance solar cells.

AB Oxidation reaction of glycerol has the probability of producing intermediate species that may be toxic to the catalyst surface and blocks the catalyst function. Thus this study presents the performance and durability of glycerol fuel cell with novel catalyst, Palladium-Aurum catalysts supported on Vapor Grown Carbon Nanofiber to reduce this effect. The electrochemical behaviour tests indicate that nanoalloy with mole ratio of Palladium to Aurum (1:1) is the best nanocatalyst that can achieve a maximum mass current of 0.17 A mg(-1) based on cyclic voltammetry analysis on glycerol oxidation in alkaline media. Apparently, the cell performance was improved from 0.0058 W cm(-2) wih Palladium black to 0.007 W cm(-2) via Palladium-Aurum/Vapor Grown Carbon Nanofiber. Moreover, the present of Vapor Grown Carbon Nanofiber, as a support, give stability and durability to the catalyst due to unnoticeable deactivation after being used several times. In addition, the influence of the operating conditions (example: temperature and Sodium hydroxide concentration) towards the electrochemical kinetic activity was also studied in detail through the determination of the activation energies.

AB This study attempts to optimize and examine the techno-economic feasibility of off-grid hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) to satisfy simultaneously electric, heat and hydrogen load of a large energy consumer. An innovative method is adopted so as to recover surplus electricity to generate heat and cut emissions. The system is comprised of solar panels, wind turbine, diesel generator, electrolyzer and boiler to supply 9910 kWh/day of electricity, 14 kg/day of hydrogen and thermal energy in five different major cities in Iran, namely Bandar Abbas, Shiraz, Tabriz, Tehran and Yazd. These figures are computed on average and the thermal load differs according to yearly weather temperature, which are 75, 22, 2000, 5200, 2200 and 1800 kWh/day respectively. To serve this purpose, HOMER Pro software was used and thermal load controller (TLC) (including electric boiler) was added to generate thermal energy by converting excess electricity of renewable energy production. Thus, a decrease in conventional fuel consumption, emissions and cost of energy (COE), as well as an increase in the renewable fraction of HRES without increasing project's size would be achievable. To meet peak demand and avoid intermittent behavior of HRES, a 1000 kW generator was picked up. Results indicate that recovering extra electricity can enhance renewable fraction by up to 35% and bring down COE and exhausted CO2 by 7.1% and 10.6% respectively, which highlight the necessity of TLC in HRES, chiefly in off-grid systems.

AB The present study reports ultrasound-assisted biodiesel synthesis using blended feedstock of non-edible oils and commercial immobilized lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus. Optimum process parameters obtained using Box-Behnken statistical design were as follows: alcohol/oil molar ratio = 7.64:1, enzyme loading = 3.55% (w/w) and temperature = 36 degrees C, conversion = 90%. Sonication of reaction mixture resulted in lowering of activation energy to 100.4 kJ/mol (from 124.4 kJ/mol under mechanical agitation). Addition of water to reaction mixture (10% v/v) not only boosted biodiesel yield from 90% to 94% but also lowered activation energy to 78.7 kJ/mol. Analysis of reaction kinetics using ordered Bi-Bi model revealed drastic rise (similar to 1.6 x) in reaction velocity with concurrent changes in Michaelis-Menten and dissociation constant of both substrate and products. Finally, the recycled enzyme showed good retention of activity up to 6 cycles in presence of ultrasound, which further enhanced with water addition to reaction mixture.

AB Carbon dioxide has been proposed as a new working fluid in energy storage system since compressed air energy storage technology is restricted in application by geological formations. Besides, combined cooling, heating and power system can supply diversified energies to users. A novel trigeneration system based on transcritical Brayton cycle and carbon dioxide energy storage is thus presented in this work. The operating principle of this system is described and thermodynamic model is developed for numerical analysis of the system performance. Meanwhile, parametric analysis is conducted to examine the effect of key parameters on system performance. Results indicate that a lower hot fluid reutilization ratio is beneficial for improving cooling ability, heating ability and total output energy, and this trigeneration system is much more suitable for heating users than cooling users. The operational range and cooling range of system is slightly influenced by storage pressure, but are broaden by the increase of pressure difference through first throttle valve and ambient temperature. The cooling ability and heating ability increase monotonically with storage pressure, and decrease with pressure difference through first throttle valve and ambient temperature.

The experimental studies are carried out in the newly built Central Laboratory of Yildiz Technical University, Davutpasa Campus, Istanbul, Turkey. The long parallel heat exchanger pipes are placed in two different layers of the ground that are (1) under the building foundation (ground layer), and (2) in the building foundation (concrete layer), respectively. Besides, a unique numerical model is developed in MATLAB environment to obtain temperature distributions in ground and concrete layers. Then, the numerical outputs are validated with the observed experimental results. The daily average of the energy amount extracted from the Ground and Concrete Loops was found as 5.51 and 4.63 kWh/day, respectively. The results are found satisfying for real applications in the building foundations.

AB An hourly optimization strategy to enhance dew-point indirect evaporative coolers is presented. First, the performance of the system throughout a year is modeled and then, using the hourly values of input parameters, a multi-objective optimization is done at each hour. Four diverse climatic conditions in the world, in which the system is the best cooling option, are studied while operating cost, the coefficient of performance, and water consumption are selected as the objective functions. Inlet air velocity and working to air ratio are considered as the decision variables while all the necessary constraints like meeting thermal comfort are taken into account. A previously optimized design is selected and the potential for further improvement of the system is evaluated for that design. The hourly, monthly, and annual results are presented and discussed. The obtained results reveal the huge improvement potential of the hourly optimization strategy so that it enhances the objective functions 17.8, 19.6, and 36.2% on average in the four investigated climatic conditions. Besides, as discussed thoroughly in the paper, because the hourly optimization strategy has the ability to be applied for every single design of dew-point indirect evaporative coolers in both design and retrofit stages, the introduced method is a general approach.

AB The main aim of this paper is to analyze the performances of a linear focus concentrating photovoltaic and thermal (CPV/T) system used for a residential user. In particular, a complete model able to evaluate solar input, triple junction solar cell (TJ) temperature, electrical and thermal energy of the CPV/T system and performances of the thermal energy storage battery is studied in order to match the CPV/T system energy output to the user energy loads. The integrated model is realized in TRNSYS, but some input functions are separately evaluated and then introduced in the general model. In particular, the Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) is modeled by means of the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Moreover, the cell TJ behavior is determined in terms of its temperature depending on the environmental conditions and the CPV/T system characteristics; a linear regression model is used to evaluate the cell temperature adopting data experimentally obtained. Hence, the DNI and the cell temperature represent the boundary conditions of the TRNSYS model that simulates the CPV/T system working linked to a residential user. Moreover, in order to verify if the CPV/T system is able to match the heating, cooling, SHW and electric demands of the residential user in each day of the year, four clusters have been defined. Each cluster has been realized referring to energy demands and to different environmental conditions of the year, determining four standard weeks. Finally, the dynamic model represents a new and complete tool able to calculate during all year the CPV/T system response to the residential user energy loads evaluating, by means of a control strategy, the cell and working fluid temperatures, the temperature stratification in the tank in the winter and summer seasons, the electrical and thermal performances.

AB In a "thermally decoupled" PV/T system, photovoltaic and thermal absorbers are allowed to operate at different temperatures to utilize full-spectrum sunlight. In this study, a two-axis tracking PV/T system with a SiO2/TiO2 interference thin film (irradiated by natural sunlight) was designed and fabricated initially. The SiO2/TiO2 interference thin film designed by the authors achieved a high average reflectance (R >= 96.8%) for PV bands, with a high average transmittance (T >= 85%) at 1100-2500 nm. The photoelectric, photothermal, and overall efficiencies were tested and analyzed theoretically using the first and second laws of thermodynamics. Outdoor testing indicated that PV cells with SiO2/TiO2 interference thin film can decrease by 3.0 K, and that the power generation and efficiency of the PV cells can be improved by 10% and 0.65%, respectively. The overall energy and exergy efficiency of the PV/T system based on SiO2/TiO2 interference thin film can reach 22.72% and 18.81%, i.e., 4.94% and 1.03% higher than those without a SiO2/TiO2 interference thin film, respectively. The calculated payback time was 17 years for this PV/T system.

AB Low temperature combustion (LTC) is a new mode for efficient and clean combustion in engines, and the process is mainly controlled by chemical reaction kinetics of fuel. In this paper, the numerical model of exergy analysis for LTC engine was established. The temperature, pressure and species concentration were obtained by using the homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine model of Chemkin-Pro software with the simplified mechanism of toluene reference fuel (TRF). The exergy items were further calculated to explore the effect of different intake conditions on exergy destruction in LTC process. It was found that the irreversibility related to the combustion proceeding mainly happened in low temperature and high temperature reaction zones. With the increase of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate, the proportion of working exergy increases but the irreversibility destruction of combustion decreases. Besides, N-2 component concentration in EGR gas has the greatest influence on the distribution of exergy.

AB From the perspective of cascade utilization of low-grade energy stored in the ground water, a new type of ground water-source heat pump (GWHP) system with a fresh air pre-conditioner using the ground water (abbreviated to GWHP-FAP) is proposed in this paper. For the GWHP-FAP, the ground water will be firstly used to cool/heat the fresh air in a pre-conditioner, and then enters the condenser/evaporator of heat pump (HP) unit for the secondary utilization. Thus the low-grade energy stored in the ground water is maximally used, and the energy consumption of the whole HP system and buildings is reduced. The working principle and the air treatment schemes of the GWHP-FAP are described in detail in this paper. To evaluate the performance of the GWHP-FAP, an office building is taken as an example to apply the system, and six typical cities distributed in three different climatic areas in China, i.e., Beijing, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Chengdu, Changde, Guangzhou, are selected to preliminarily discuss the applicability. The results show that the energy saving performance of the GWHP-FAP is very good. The GWHP-FAP compared with the conventional GWHP, its seasonal energy saving rates are respectively 39.2%, 34.2%, 30.1%, 36.7%, 28.4% and 16.6% for the six typical cities during the cooling mode.

AB The power production from the conversion of heat at low and medium temperature is a viable way to recover energy from several industrial and utility processes. In this context, small-medium expanders for Organic Rankine Cycles and two-phase expanders for energy recovery in heat pumps are gathering an increasing attention. The design and setup of flexible test benches to carry out experimental investigations on these devices has a primary importance to their performance optimization. In this study, a test rig based on a hot gas bypass cycle to test expanders for superheated and two-phase organic fluids is proposed. This configuration leads to numerous advantages like compact design, high flexibility and a fast transition to stable steady conditions. After an experimental campaign to assess the correct response of the test bench in design condition, a numerical model was developed to study the behavior of the cycle. The management of the test rig, both with and without the expanders, for performing the tests at different operating conditions was analyzed, with particular focus on the required setting of valves and compressor.
   The analysis allowed the determination of the operating limits of the rig, and showed the impact of using different fluids in the same test rig at several operating conditions. The working range of the test bench is related to the condenser power (designed for 25 kW and 30 bar maximum pressure) and the ambient temperature. With R404A, in the 17-30 bars condenser pressure range, superheated and saturated vapor expanders may be tested at different values of cycle minimum pressure (between 3.7-7.2 bar and 3.6-6.4 bar respectively). With R410A the working range is narrower, with the possibility of testing 2 phase expanders between 6.4 and 8.7 bars of cycle minimum pressure in the 21-23 bars interval of condenser pressure and superheated vapor expanders between 5.7 and 7.2 bars of cycle minimum pressure in the 23-30 bars interval of condenser pressure.

AB In this paper, thermo-economic evaluation of hybrid solar-conventional energy supply in a zero liquid discharge plant has been conducted. The zero liquid discharge plant includes a brine concentrator and a crystallizer. Brine concentrator and crystallizer utilize falling film and forced circulation evaporators respectively. The plant was studied thermo-economically in capital of Iran, Tehran city weather conditions. The plant performance and economics were investigated in four design (winter, spring, summer and autumn design) conditions based on the seasonal weather data and compared with the conventional energy supply system. It was concluded that the design proposed based on average weather conditions shows no economic advantage over the conventional design; due to accounting for financial aids and subsides for the fuel cost at 0.05 $/m(3), affecting the steam and water costs. However, a parametric study demonstrated that if the financial aids associated with the fuel are disregarded, it will have a pronounced effect on the cost of steam and produced water.

AB In this research, 21 combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system configurations that are based on gas engine (GE), gas turbine (GT), and microturbine (MGT) are investigated for three different energy supply scenarios: electricity & cooling, electricity & heating, and electricity & cooling & heating. Moreover, six dimensionless energy matching parameters are proposed to quantitatively measure the disparity of load demands. Thereafter, three matching maps for the GE/GT/MGT-based configurations are drawn to acquire direct insight on the energy matching performance between CCHP systems and users. Concurrently, the mathematical relationship between the matching parameters and energy-saving rate (ESR) is established. Moreover, the ESR values of different capacity design methods and operation strategies for the three energy supply scenarios are discussed and compared. The results show that the maximum ESR value is reached when the energy supply and demand achieved the ideal matching. The following electric load strategy (FEL) and the priority-to-providing electricity capacity design method (PPE) are the better choices for most situations in terms of system design and operation control, respectively. Moreover, a thermodynamic boundary map of the ESR was drawn to intuitively understand the configurations of energy demands from the most suitable CCHP users as well as the boundaries of ESR for different energy supply scenarios. Finally, the survey results of the indigenous CCHP systems that had been conducted to gain insight on the development of these systems in China are presented in this paper.

AB This study conducts an optimization analysis of the geometry of an intake manifold of an internal combustion engine by using a numerical approach based on the 1D GT-POWER simulation platform. The optimization process was modeled using the Brent method, during which calculations are made of the lengths of the intake manifold runners that provide the engine's greatest volumetric efficiency at each speed of rotation in the range of 1000-6000 RPM. Having obtained the optimized lengths of the runners, it was possible to simulate the engine operating with the parameterized intake manifold based on the length of each runner. From the analysis of the volumetric efficiency curves based on the speed of rotation for the length of each runner of the manifold, it was verified that the shorter the runner length, the greater the volumetric efficiency that occurs when the engine is under high speeds of rotation. Based on the behavior of the volumetric efficiency curves, a variable configuration of the geometry of the intake manifold was proposed. The results of the performance of the engine when operating under this proposal showed that the engine can achieve higher values of volumetric efficiency, torque and effective horsepower, depending on the speed conditions, and consequently lower values for the brake specific fuel consumption.

AB Two-phase closed thermosyphon as a gravity-assisted heat pipe is an efficient heat transfer device in which heat transmits by evaporation and condensation of a working fluid. Nanofluids are suspensions of nano-sized solid particles in a base fluid which can be used as heat transfer media in the thermosyphon. In the present study, thermal performance of functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes/water nanofluids was investigated in a novel type of thermosyphon which was made of an evaporator with square frustum shape, and a condenser composed of two connected tubes. To prepare nanofluids, multi-walled carbon nanotubes were first functionalized using two oxidant agents (potassium persulfate and sodium persulfate) to improve the cooling performance of nanofluids. The prepared nanofluids were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, zeta potential, and thermal conductivity analyzer. The results of characterization showed that the nanofluid with sodium functional group had higher stability as well as higher thermal conductivity. Thermal efficiency and thermal resistance were calculated to evaluate the thermal performance of thermosyphon. Using nanofluid with sodium functional group in the thermosyphon showed better performance in terms of higher thermal efficiency and lower thermal resistance. Experimental results also showed that the thermosyphon could perform at higher input powers (up to 90 W) using the nanofluid compared to water (up to 70 W). Furthermore, the results of the temperature distribution of thermosyphon during the test confirmed that two connected tubes in the condenser section could provide pathways for both condensate liquid and vapor. In other words, this behavior indicated that this type of thermosyphon can be considered between a tubular thermosyphon and a loop thermosyphon.

AB Recovering waste heat from the exhaust gases of heavy-duty diesel truck engines by using the organic Rankine cycle can reduce both fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The design of such systems is constrained by the space available for installation; thus, an optimization procedure is required. In this research work, a two-objective optimization, based on the maximization of power output and minimization of the total heat exchanger surface area, is implemented in the Engineering Equation Solver software package. Application of the developed procedure is illustrated in a case with an exhaust gas temperature of 394.2 degrees C and mass flow rate of 0.306 kg/s. Configurations both with and without a recuperator are analyzed, and four working fluids (water, ethanol, toluene, and hexamethyldisiloxane) are compared. Of these fluids, ethanol could be recommended as the best when considering the organic Rankine cycle power output and the total area/volume of heat exchangers. For a total surface area of 10 m(2) in the case without the recuperator, the power output values for ethanol, water, and toluene are 17.6 kW, 17.2 kW, and 15.8 kW, respectively; with the recuperator, the power output is slightly higher, but the total area of heat exchangers is considerably larger. Again, the best working fluid is ethanol: for a total surface area of heat exchangers of 24 m(2), the power output values for ethanol, toluene, and hexamethyldisiloxane are 18 kW, 17.1 kW, and 15.8 kW, respectively. The presented procedure is useful both for the conceptual design of a complete waste heat recovery unit and for the optimization of all heat exchangers.

AB A novel hybrid system model is established to boost the energy conversion efficiency of an alkali metal thermoelectric converter (AMTEC) by combining with an absorption refrigerator (AR). Based on the available models of the AMTEC and AR, the power output and the efficiency of the hybrid system are discussed. Power outputs and efficiencies of the subsystems and hybrid system are compared, and the advantages of the proposed device are demonstrated. Maximum efficiencies of the stand-alone AMTEC and hybrid system are 26.57% and 39.24%, respectively. The optimally working regions for the current density, power output, and efficiency of the hybrid system are determined. The effects of the cooled space temperature on the working region of the current density are revealed, and the influences of the condenser temperature of the AMTEC and the heat-transfer irreversibility on the established system performance are also discussed.

AB In this paper, the new configuration of transcritical CO2 refrigeration cycle combined with a thermoelectric subcooler and an ejector (TES + EJE) is proposed. The thermoelectric subcooler is installed after the gas cooler in the transcritical CO2 refrigeration cycle with an ejector. Comparisons are carried out with the conventional transcritical CO2 refrigeration cycle (BASE), CO2 cycle with a thermoelectric subcooler (TES) and CO2 cycle with an ejector (EJE). Maximum cooling coefficient of performance (COPc) is obtained for the new TES + EJE cycle with a simultaneous optimization of subcooling temperature and discharge pressure. The improved new cycle exhibits higher COPc and lower discharge pressure compared with the other three cycles. Compared with the BASE cycle, the maximum COPc of the TES + EJE cycle is increased by 39.34% and the corresponding optimum discharge pressure is reduced by 8.01% under given operation conditions of 5 degrees C evaporation temperature and 40 degrees C gas cooler outlet temperature. The effects of the subcooling temperature, discharge pressure, gas cooler outlet temperature and evaporation temperature on the TES + EJE system performance are also discussed by energy and exergy analysis and results present here.

AB In this article, a unique phase change redox (PCR) system capable of converting surplus electricity to sensible, latent, and thermochemical energy is proposed as an alternative technology for utility-scale energy storage. During the energy charging period, the system utilizes external heat to reduce and melt solid CuO into molten CuO/Cu2O at a high temperature in a reduction reactor. The external heat can be provided by Joule heating using the surplus electricity from the power grid or renewable energy plants (solar/wind). In this way, the surplus electricity is stored in the forms of sensible, latent, and thermochemical energy. A high value-added by-product, oxygen, can be produced simultaneously, which further enhances the economic competitiveness of the proposed system. During the energy discharging period, the molten CuO/Cu2O is oxidized and cooled in an oxidation reactor using air. In this step, the stored energy is released and transferred to the high-pressure and high-temperature air, which can be further converted into power via an air Brayton cycle coupled with a bottoming organic Rankine cycle. The simulation package, Aspen Plus v10, is used to develop a thermodynamic model of the PCR system, in which its technical performance and influential parameters are examined in details. The simulation study shows that the PCR process can achieve a round trip efficiency of about 50% with an energy storage density of up to 1600 kJ/kg. The parametric analysis reveals that the round trip efficiency of the PCR system is greatly influenced by the compression ratio, while the energy storage density and oxygen production are affected by the temperature and oxygen partial pressure of the reduction reactor. Apart from the simulation study, thermogravimetric analyses on phase change redox cycles are also carried out. The experiment results are found to successfully validate the key energy storage mechanism behind the PCR process, namely the reduction, melting, solidification, and oxidation processes. The reversibility and stability of the PCR process over 10 cycles are found to be excellent with minor degradation and enthalpy changes.

AB In this study, a numerical model to analyse the charging and discharging characteristics of a horizontal shell and tube type Latent Heat Storage (LHS) prototype is presented. The system comprises of Sodium Nitrate as phase change material (PCM) in the shell side and flow of air as heat transfer fluid (HTF) in the tube side. The effective heat capacity approach is followed while solving the fluid flow and energy interactions in the PCM. The design is optimized by modifying a cylindrical shell into a conical shell heat exchanger system. The optimized values of diameters at inlet and outlet of the conical shell are found to be 98.6 mm and 54 mm, respectively having a cone angle of 3.4. A performance comparison is made with a cylindrical shell system of equivalent storage capacity. 3-D numerical simulations performed on the proposed system revealed that an innovation in the design leads to enhanced heat transfer rate caused by uniform melting throughout the system. Further, the conical shell model is numerically simulated for various operating parameters such as inlet HTF velocity and temperature. Also, the effect of fins attached on the HTF tube on the performance of the system is analysed. With the advent of advanced heat exchanger design, there is a greater scope of obtaining higher heat transfer rates employing the proposed conical shell and tube LHS system.

AB The present study focuses on energy and exergy analyses of the trigeneration system consisting of heliostat field, organic Rankine cycle with the heat exchanger, and ejector-absorption chiller which has the merits of refrigerating a thermal load of below than 0 degrees C with solar energy more efficiently along with the generation of process heat and electric power in an eco-friendly manner. A parametric study is carried out to investigate the effect of varying the influencing operating variables on trigeneration system output, and its energy and exergy efficiencies. It is found that the exergetic output of isobutane operated system increases from 2562 kW to 4314 kW while for propane operated system it is raised from 1203 kW to 2028 kW when the direct normal irradiations are increased from 600 to 1000 W/m(2). Results of energy and exergy utilization show that for isobutane ORC fluid, out of 100% solar energy supplied to the system 65.42% can be produced as energetic output and rest 34.58% is lost via thermal exhaust to ambient. On the other hand, out of 100% solar exergy supplied only 13.98% is the produced exergy, 84.89% is the exergy destroyed due to irreversibilities, and rest 1.13% is the exergy loss.

AB Decarbonisation is one of the most important challenges facing researchers, and solar-assisted systems represent an important solution to reduce the energy consumption at the household-scale. The current work contributes to existing research by proposing and validating a novel lumped parameter simulation model for photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collectors using field measurements carried out at an experimental facility. The modelling approach, which also considers the effect of the thermal capacitances of the elements composing the photovoltaic thermal collector, used an electrical analogy method to solve the transient heat transfer problem. The results of the simulations were compared with the experimental data collected during different weather conditions; the effects of the thermal capacitances of the collector were also investigated. The results were compared in terms of both average daily performance and instantaneous values of the variables characterizing the system. Although the differences were negligible, the results of the simulation analyses matched the measurements more precisely when the thermal capacitances were taken into consideration. Finally, the simulation model was implemented as a TYPE of Transient System Simulation (TRNSYS) software, and it is made freely available to facilitate future integrated computer simulations.

AB The Fe2O3-Al2O3 oxygen carrier is regarded to a promising candidate for chemical looping combustion (CLC). However, Fe2O3-Al2O3 oxygen carrier was often subjected to a decrease of oxygen carrying capacity. The deactivation mechanism of Fe2O3-Al2O3 oxygen carrier in chemical looping combustion was investigated over consecutive 20 cycles. The Fe2O3-Al2O3 oxygen carrier exhibited relatively poor redox stability in a fixed bed reactor. The physico-chemical properties of cycled Fe2O3-Al2O3 oxygen carrier were characterized by different characterization methods. No carbon deposit was detected in the reduction process, indicating that carbon deposition was not the cause for Fe2O3-Al2O3 oxygen carrier deactivation under this experimental condition. The characterization results showed that the deactivation of Fe2O3-Al2O3 oxygen carrier in redox cycles was mainly attributed to thermal sintering. The cycled Fe2O3-Al2O3 oxygen carrier showed lower surface area, lower reducibility and oxygen mobility than that of fresh sample. After a certain number of redox cycles, Fe diffusion and enrichment at the surface of cycled oxygen carrier was observed. The surface Fe is unstable under high reaction temperature, leading to accelerate thermal sintering. A deactivation mechanism of Fe2O3-Al2O3 oxygen carrier in CLC was proposed based on the Fe diffusion and surface sintering.

AB Non-uniform cross-sectional designs of serpentine channel in direct methanol fuel cells are systematically studied in the present work. A parametric design is proposed to describe and classify channel geometries whose effects on cell performance are numerically and experimentally analyzed. Numerical results show that the non-uniform converging designs are beneficial for both in- and through-plane methanol transportations, and thus to enhance the peak power generation performance as much as 12% at high-current-density operations. Effectiveness of non-uniform designs for power generation enhancements is also validated by experimental studies which consider various operating conditions, and significant enhancement of power generation (18.4%) is noticed by the usage of non-uniform converging design. Optimal application conditions for the non-uniform converging designs are determined to be the high-current-density operations with high temperatures.

AB The conventional hydraulic drive system for a heavy-load mobile manipulator is usually operated under single mode, such that both inlet/outlet and potential energy losses are large to lower the energy efficiency. In this paper, a novel electro-hydraulic drive system is presented to improve energy efficiency. Extended control degrees of freedom are obtained utilizing the independent metering valve and electronic controlled pump. Then, multiple operating modes are carried out pertaining to the cylinder, valve, and pump. To achieve both optimal energy efficiency and precise motion tracking, both multi-mode switching and multi-variable controller are designed to accommodate with time-varying and uncertain load characteristics. As a consequence, the inlet, outlet, and potential energy losses can be decreased simultaneously. The experimental validation is conducted by using a three joint manipulator in a 2 t excavator. A duty cycle of movement including all three actuators and covering full load quadrants is used to evaluate the efficiency improvement. Compared with the conventional load sensing system, the proposed multi-mode switching system using the pump pressure with valve meter-in control mode yields a 25.8% energy-saving ratio. Furthermore, the pump flow with valve mete-out control mode yields a 35.3% energy-saving ratio. Using this combined control mode, higher efficiency can be obtained due to the minimum inlet losses, but faster dynamic response together with higher overshoot will appear. It is proved that the energy efficiency is improved, while the motion tracking performance is not degraded by introducing the multi-mode switching.

ID SPEED; GENERATION; TESTS
AB In a large number of previous studies, the technical wind energy potential was estimated from national to global scale. Usually, it was assumed that the underlying meteorological potential remains constant over time. However, the wind resource greatly varies on different temporal scales including inter-annual and multi-decadal scales. In this study, the long-term variability of national and global technical wind energy potentials was assessed for the period 1971-2010 based on wind speed data from the coupled atmosphere/land-surface/ocean-wave model ERA-20C. Within this period, the annual national and global wind energy generation was reconstructed assuming an average number of 0.01-0.25 wind turbines per km(2) sited on geographically nonrestricted areas. The applied wind turbines have an average rated power of 3.67 MW and a hub height of 100 m. While no significant trend in technical wind energy potential was found in the majority of the countries studied, the Mann-Kendall and Cox-Stuart trend tests revealed significantly increasing trends in 37 countries and significantly decreasing trends in 10 countries. In addition, the results show that the inter-annual variability of the wind energy potential is influenced not only by the wind resource itself, but also by the rate of wind turbine expansion. From the presented results it is clear that the quantification of the long-term variability of the wind energy potential is an important prerequisite for controlling and adapting the expansion of wind energy on national and global scales to future electricity consumption.

AB DCHE (Desiccant coated heat exchanger) based heat pump systems can handle sensible and latent loads simultaneously and separately within one single component via flowing refrigerant and coated desiccant. Their characteristics have a crucial impact on the performance of the whole system. To ensure energy efficiency of DCHE based systems, the restriction between refrigerant and desiccant is discussed based on energy consumption analysis. Results show that energy consumption of the DCHE based heat pump is intimately related with its coefficient of performance and adsorption heat of coated desiccant. R410A and R32 are found to be promising refrigerants for DCHE systems. Maximum allowable values of adsorption heat under different ambient air conditions and sensible heat ratios are obtained. Desiccant materials with adsorption heat of 2300-3000 kJ/kg such as various silica gels, all-silica zeolites and salt supported composites are within maximum allowable values of adsorption heat for most conditions. When applying the majority of zeolite type desiccants that possess adsorption heat more than 4000 kJ/kg, great attention should be paid to the determination of supply-air temperature difference. This paper provides the underlying insights needed to guide a fast and proper selection of refrigerants and desiccants for DCHE based systems.

AB It remains debated as to whether the Gaoligong Orogen between the Tengchong and Baoshan blocks in Yunnan, China, is the southward extension of the Tibetan Bangonghu-Nujiang Suture (BNS). Here we present new geochronological and petrochemical data for Early Cretaceous magmatic rocks of the Gaoligong Orogen. The LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating of zircons from diorites, granodiorites, and granites yielded weighted mean Pb-206/U-238 ages of 120-118, 128-122, and 109-128 Ma, respectively. For the diorites, the epsilon(Hf)(t) values of zircons fall in a range of +1.2 to + 5.4 with T-DM(C) ages of 744-979 Ma, for the granodiorites they fall in a range of - 9.8 to + 2.9 with T-DM(C) ages of 888-1564 Ma, and for the granites the range is -8.0 to -1.1 with T-DM(C) ages of 1101-1488 Ma. They are magnsian, calc-alkaline, enriched in LILEs and LREEs, and have strong negative Nb, Ta, P, and Ti anomalies and high values of Mg-#. All these features are indicative of continental arc affinities. The data suggest that the dioritic and granitic magmas were produced by the mixing of variable proportions of mantle- and crust-derived magmas at an active continental margin. The ages and tectonic settings of the diorites, granodiorites, and granites are similar to rocks found within the BNS. Considering the ophiolitic melange belt, the Middle Jurassic basaltic magmatism, and the marine-fades stratigraphic features of the Gaoligong Orogen are very similar to features in the BNS, we conclude that the Gaoligong Orogen represents the suture between the Tengchong and Baoshan blocks, and is the southward extension of the BNS.

AB We present the results of field mapping, paleontology, and detrital zircon geochronology of newly found clastic rocks with intercalations of limestone in the Gaerqin area of Tibet (Gaerqin Formation). The Gaerqin Formation consists of sandstone, siltstone, and shale with intercalations of bioclastic limestone. Abundant Late Triassic (Norian) fossils are found in the limestone beds. The fossils include Distichophyllia norica, Retiophyllia litangensis, and Mesozoic Chaetetida. In addition, 273 detrital zircons were selected for U-Pb dating, yielding the following age groups: 210-300, 500-600, 800-1100, 1600-1800, and 2400-2600 Ma. More than 80% of the detrital zircons are older than similar to 550 Ma, and the most reliable youngest detrital zircon age for the Gaerqin Formation is similar to 219 Ma. The results indicate that the Gaerqin Formation formed in a shallow marine to bathyal continental slope environment, and represents the first reported Upper Triassic (Norian) strata in the Gaerqin area of Tibet. The findings also suggest that the Bangong Co-Nujiang Tethys Ocean was a bathyal basin by the Late Triassic.

AB The collision between India and Eurasia and the subsequent uplift of the Qinghai-Xizang plateau region of the Eurasian continent during the latest Mesozoic and Cenozoic had a significant environmental impact on the region. Understanding the vegetation of both palaeocontinents prior to the collision is crucial for interpreting the evolution of their floras and climatic changes during this period. The composition of the vegetation and climate of the plateau from the Middle Jurassic until the end of the Oligocene are inferred herein from the composition of 14 palynofloras and compared with other regions of China. The palynofloras are similar to those of eastern and northwestern parts of China but bear their own unique features brought about by differing climatic influences. Overall, a warm-hot, arid-semi-arid climate prevailed over the plateau during most of the period from the Middle Jurassic until the end of the Cretaceous. The climate cooled and humidity increased in the Paleogene, and especially during the Oligocene. The long-term climatic change in the Qinghai-Xizang plateau region of the Eurasian continent during the Middle Jurassic-Paleogene that is indicated by the miospore assemblages is broadly comparable to the isotope-based SST (sea-surface temperature) changes that have been identified. It is apparent that climatic changes on a global scale were primarily responsible for controlling the composition and distribution of the vegetation on the plateau; no monsoon features are detectable in the northwestern interior of China. A maximum estimation of 2890 m surface palaeoelevation is inferred for the central and northern plateau during the Oligocene based on vegetation analysis, which is lower than previous estimations based on oxygen isotope and coexistence analyses. The elevation of the southern part of the study area, i.e. the area south of the Gandise Mountains, was low, close to sea-level.

AB Numerous moderately preserved radiolarians of Tethyan affinity were extracted from a purple-red chert sample from the Luoqu Section on the southern side of the Yarlung-Tsangpo suture zone in the Xigaze area, southern Tibet. Ninety-three species belonging to 35 genera are recognized, of which one is described as Citriduma pentaptera sp. nov.; most of them are reported from Tibet for the first time. Significantly, this radiolarian assemblage of nassellarians, subordinate spumellarians and rare entactinarians can be compared with those in Oman, Japan, Oregon and Queen Charlotte Islands and is further assigned to the Eucyrtidiellum nagaiae-Praeparvicingula tlellensis zone of late Pliensbachian in age. This indicates that the pelagic deposits of the Neo-Tethys Ocean in the Xialu area were laid down at least during or since the late Pliensbachian, much earlier than the Aalenian age previously considered.

TI Constraints of bipolar and tropical bivalves on the northward drifting

AB We employed a novel approach using the bipolar and tropical distributions of bivalves to track the northward drift of the Indian Plate. The Kimmeridgian-Tithonian Retroceramus, Tithonian Anopaea and Buchia, and Aptian-Cenomanian Aucellina were mainly restricted to areas poleward of 30 degrees N and 30 degrees S, but middle Oxfordian-latest Cretaceous rudist bivalves were mainly restricted to areas between the paleolatitudes 30 degrees S and 30 degrees N. The distributions of these paleolatitude indicators in late Mesozoic time record five major drifting phases of the northward translation of the Indian Plate. In the Late Jurassic-earliest Cretaceous, the Indian Plate was a part of Gondwana, and various bipolar bivalves were present. During the Aptian-Albian interval, the Indian Plate was separated from Gondwana, but most parts of this plate were still under cold water, likely south of 30 degrees S, and even at higher latitudes, because bipolar bivalves still existed at the northern margin of this plate, in the Tethyan Himalaya. In the Cenomanian, the northern part of the Indian Plate translated north into a warm/subtropical environments, north of 30 degrees S, but southern India was still in a cold region, south of 30 degrees S, as evidenced by Aucellina, which had already disappeared from the northern part of the Indian Plate, but still survived in southern India. In the latest Campanian, at least the Tethyan Himalaya of the northern margin of the Indian Plate had drifted into the area north of 30 degrees S, based on the appearance of Bournonia haydeni then in Tibet. Rudists occupied both the northern (Tethyan Himalaya) and southern (southern India) parts of the India Plate by the Maastrichtian, which demonstrate that the Indian Plate completely entered the tropical area, and roughly coincided with the initial collision between the Indian and Eurasian continents around the Maastrichtian-Paleocene.

AB We present vegetation reconstructions based on an almost complete succession through the Triassic of Tulong, Nyalam County, southern Xizang (Tibet), China. The Permian and earliest Triassic samples were barren of palynomorphs, however, in overlying strata we identified well-preserved and diverse miospore assemblages. Seven pollen and spore zones spanning the Olenekian to the Rhaetian were recognized. These palynological zones were amalgamated into three floral stages that comprise distinct vegetation types: (1) an early Olenekian lycophyte-dominated flora with common pteridosperms, indicative of a warm and dry climate; (2) a late Olenekian transitional flora composed of abundant conifers with low abundances of lycophytes, signifying a decrease in temperature and increase in humidity; (3) a Middle to Late Triassic mature conifer-dominated flora with diverse sphenophytes, ferns and cycadophytes, indicative of a stable, temperate and humid climate. The changes in vegetation and climate tentatively correlate with the rifting of northern Gondwana, suggesting that regional tectonics was a contributive driving factor to local floral community change.

AB New fossil plants are reported from the lower part of the Linbuzong Formation at Qubsang, Doilungdeqen, Lhasa, Tibet. The assemblage comprises Neocalamites sp., Ptilozamites tibetica Yang, Ptilozamites sp., ?Ptilozamites sp., Zamites sp. 1, Zamites sp. 2, ?Zamites (?Otozamites) sp. 1, ?Zamites sp. 2., Ptilophyllum sp. 1, Ptilophyllum sp. 2, Ptilophyllum sp. 3, Geinitzia sp. and Elatocladus (?Torreyites) sp. Among these plants at least two of them, Ptilozamites tibetica and Elatocladus (?Torreyites) sp. are firstly discovered in this area, and the others occured frequently in the Mesozoic flora in Tibet. Associated miospores suggests an Early Cretaceous age for the assemblage. The abundance of Ptilophyllwn and conifer Geinitzia sp. and the absence of Ginkgoales might indicate a palaeoenvironment with both a low latitude and high temperatures, and a tropical arid to semi-arid climate predominating in this coastal area. The Qubsang assemblage, composed mainly of Bennettitales and Coniferopsida, does not resemble any contemporaneous ones known from Gondwanaland or Eurasia. Although the flora lacks characteristic Wealden ferns, such as Weichselia, the plant assemblage shows a general relation to Tethyan floras of the area and might roughly correspond in age to the Wealden floras of Western Europe.

AB In the Dazhuoma stratigraphic section near the Gangni Township, Amdo County, northern Tibet, China, the Paleocene-lower Eocene Niubao Formation yields plenty of well-preserved microfossils and insects. A restudy of Hylophalangopsis chinensis Lin and Huang, 2006, an orthopteran insect from this formation, indicates that it should be attributed to Zeuneropterinae of Stenopelmatidae instead of Prophalangopsidae of Hagloidea in the original study. Some characters preserved in this species are herein considered transitional between Aboilinae (Prophalangopsidae) and Stenopelmatoidea, supporting the deduction that a dose relationship exists between Stenopelmatoidea and Aboilinae. The close relationship of Hylophalangopsis with the other zeuneropterines in Canada and Scotland indicates a middle-late Paleocene age for the lower Niubao Formation, supported by some previous studies, and further suggests a warm and humid climate in the Dazhuoma area in the middle-late Paleocene, supported by some important evidence.

AB Two new Middle Permian foraminifer faunas are described from the Xiala Formation in the Zhabuye and Xiadong sections in the central Lhasa Block. The presence of some significant taxa in paleobiogeography such as Shanita, Lysites biconcavus, Hemigordiopsis subglobosa, indicates that the Lhasa Block was in the Cimmerian Province in paleobiogeography during the Middle Permian. Furthermore, the Nankinella-Chusenella fusuline assemblage that occurs in the upper part of the Xiala Formation in the Xiadong section resembles contemporaneous fusuline faunas from the Xainza and Bashor areas in the Lhasa Block and the northern part of the Tengchong Block. The endemism of the Nankinella-Chusenella assemblage in the Lhasa and Tengchong blocks indicates that these two blocks were isolated from both the South Qiangtang Block and the northern Gondwanan margin during the Middle Permian. It further suggests that both the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean and the Neotethys Ocean would have opened before the Middle Permian. A new species Chusenella tsochenensis sp.nov. was described.

AB The semi-aquatic hemipteran family Gerridae (water striders), similar to other gerromorphan bugs, is a distinct group noted for their ability to walk on the surface of water, especially with respect to their locomotion, feeding, and behaviour. The three principal Holarctic gerrine genera, Aquarius Schellenberg, Gerris Fabricius and Limnoporus Stal, are important organisms for studies of biogeography, evolutionary trends and ecological adaptations of the Gerridae. Fossil gerrids are comparatively sparse, and direct fossil evidence elucidating the early diversification and biogeography of the extant widespread genus Aquarius remains elusive. Here we re-describe and reinterpret the extinct species Aquarius lunpolaensis (Lin, 1981) based on new well-preserved conspecific specimens from contemporaneous localities in the Lunpola and Nima basins of central Tibet, China. The new fossils confirm the placement of these fossils in Aquarius as evidenced by their large body size, first antennal segment longer than the following two segments combined, and well-developed abdominal connexival spines. The new discovery of a series of larval instars at different developmental stages confirms that "Halobates bagonensis" should be interpreted as an exuvium of the dominant species Aquarius lunpolaensis and demonstrates that the extant western Palaearctic najas-group had a much wider distribution in the late Oligocene (Chattian). The occurrence of an Aquarius water skater supports the hypothesis that the elevation of central Tibet was comparatively low, some 25 million years ago.

AB It is essential to have a clear scientific view on paleoclimate change and its potential environmental and socioeconomic impacts for the prediction of future climate change. Fluvial sediment is one of the best archives for the investigations of high-resolution environmental variability and anthropogenic impacts on catchment over the last hundreds or even thousands years (Anthropocene). In this study, we examine magnetic properties of a 130-year fluvial sediment profile from an island in the main channel of the lower Yangtze mainstream, which aims to determine the connections between modern observational data and paleoclimate signals from sediments. Sediments from the upper Yangtze River is characterized by high concentration of magnetite, which is different from the middle reach. The difference of magnetic properties allows us to trace particles in the lower reach back to upstream of the Yangtze River. Climate change that reconstructed from physical properties of sediment (susceptibility and mean grain size) is comparable to those records in historical documents, which provides a possible way to obtain precise ages. The calibrated sedimentation rate reflects long-term variation of flood/drought events over the catchment, which is dominantly controlled by the climate circulation of Pacific. The enhanced human impacts since 1950s especially in the mid-lower reaches are observed. Therefore, riverine sediment not only contains paleoclimate information, but also reflects human activities.

AB We report our newly obtained geochronological and geochemical data of volcanic rocks in the Tsarigiin gol area, Ereendavaa terrane to better understand of the Early-Middle Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the Kherlen massif, NE Mongolia. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating reveals two stages of magmatism in the southern part of the Ereendavaa terrane: one in Late Ordovician (similar to 462 to 455 Ma) and the other in Early Devonian (similar to 418 Ma). The Late Ordovician Tsarig volcanic rocks are medium to high-K calc-alkaline and intermediate to felsic in composition and characterized by relative enrichment of LREE and LILEs (e.g., Rb and U) and also by relative depletion of HFSEs (e.g. Nb, Ta, P and Ti), a typical feature of subduction-related magmas. These rocks have mostly positive whole-rock epsilon(Nd)(t) (+1.65 to +1.35) and zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) ( + 0.1 to +4.07) values with Mesoproterozoic Nd and Hf model ages of 1.59-1.09 Ga. They were likely generated in a continental arc setting, and their parental magmas were originated from a common source as the product of extensive fractional crystallization of mafic melts and their interaction with arc crust.
   The Early Devonian Chandmana volcanic rocks consist of rhyolite and minor trachybasalt, displaying a typical bimodal distribution. The trachybasaltic rocks are characterized by low La-n/Sm-n (2.08-2.60), Tb-n/Yb-n (1.42-1.50) and La/Yb (7.51-8.96) ratios and relatively flat MREE to HREE patterns with epsilon(Nd)(t) values being close to zero ( -1.36 to + 0.13). The rhyolites are high-K calc-alkaline and possess variably negative epsilon(Hf)(t) ( - 4.96 to -0.29) and epsilon(Nd)(t) ( - 2.14 to -0.57) values, exhibiting a strong affinity to A2-type granites. Considering the distinct compositional gap between the end-members and geochemical and isotopic signature of the bimodal suite, the felsic magma is interpreted to have derived from partial melting of a hybrid crustal source composed of both Pre-Neoproterozoic and juvenile crustal materials, while the mafic rocks were probably derived from a mantle source previously metasomatized by slab-derived melt.
   The two phases of magmatism in the southern part of the Ereendavaa terrane reflected two stages of tectonic evolution: Early-Middle Paleozoic subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean plate that gave rise to the Late Neoproterozoic-Early Cambrian Undur-Khaan island arc and Late Cambrian to Late Ordovician Ereendavaa active continental margin. Silurian amalgamation of the Ereendavaa and Idermeg terranes (Kherlen massif) caused the break-off of the subducted slab and the Early to Middle Devonian extension in the area.

AB Sanukitic dikes, mainly consisting of pyroxene diorite porphyrite, diorite porphyry, quartz diorite porphyrite and quartz diorite, were widely distributed in the Bieluagaxi area, southern West Junggar. In this contribution, we present new LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb ages, major and trace elements, and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopes for these dioritic dikes. These rocks formed in the early Late Carboniferous (ca. 319-315 Ma), coeval with abundant magmatic rocks in the region, and exhibit high MgO, Cr and Ni concentrations and K/Na ratios, and also show strong enrichment in large ion lithophile elements relative to high field strength elements, with pronounced negative Nb, Ta, and Ti anomalies, analogues to those of Cenozoic sanukitoids of the Setouchi Volcanic Belt. Compositionally, the sanukitic dikes are divided into two groups. Group 1 have MgO contents greater than 6 wt% (6.18-9.34 wt%), with Mg# values ranging from 58.2 to 73.7. They also have relatively low SiO2 (51.7-55.7 wt%) and Sr (356 ppm in average) contents, and low Sr/Y (15.1-25.4) ratios, but high concentrations of Cr (6.2-490 ppm) and Ni (12.8-163 ppm). Compared to the Group 1, the Group 2 samples have slightly lower MgO (2.12-5.58 wt%; Mg# = 45.8-68.5), Cr (10.1-329 ppm) and Ni (2.84-136 ppm), but relatively higher SiO2 (58.6-65.7 wt%) and Sr (304-521 ppm) concentrations and Sr/Y (19.2-41.0) ratios, making them akin to adakitic rocks elsewhere. These dikes also exhibit depleted Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic signatures, with (Sr-87/Sr-86) 1 = 0.70353-0.70480, epsilon Nd(t) = +5.03 to + 7.61, epsilon Hf(t) = +10.9 to + 15.3. Geochemical and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic data suggest that the Group 1 rocks are similar to the typical sanuldtoids of the Setouchi Volcanic Belt, and were likely derived from partial melting of a depleted mantle source with subducted sediment melts. While the Group 2 rocks show a remarkable geochemical affinity with the Northwestern Karamay sanukitoids, and were derived from partial melting of a depleted mantle source metasomatized by slab-derived adakitic melts and fluids. Combined with the identified and reported subduction-related magmatism, i.e., adakites, sanukitoids, Nb-enriched basalts, lagged arc volcanic rocks, and I-type granitoids in the Western Junggar region and taking into consideration the previous achievements, therefore, we consider a multi-stage subduction-accretionary orogeny model may account for the difference of subduction duration between the northern segment and southern segment of Western Junggar.

AB The paper presents new original data and a review of previous studies on the Late Carboniferous - Early Permian granitoids of the Kunush and Kalguty intrusive complexes from the Kalba fold belt (East Kazakhstan). These rocks formed at the initial post-collisional stage of the Irtish-Zaisan orogen in the western Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). The granitoids form isometric or NW linear intrusions inside the Late Devonian - Early Carboniferous metasediments which overlap the accretionary lithology of the Kalba fold belt in front of the Altai active margin of the Siberian continent. These granitoids contain zircon grains with U-Pb ages of ca.308-291 Ma, synchronous with the peak post-orogenic magmatic event at similar to 300 Ma in the CAOB. The Kunush high-Na granitoids, with high SiO2 (67-72%) and Al2O3 (15-18%) contents and the Na2O/K2O ratio (1.94-6.43), and low HREEs (Yb = 0.22-0.93 ppm) but moderate Sr/Y ratios (47-179), Mg# (35-55) and Ni, Cr, are generally common to high-Al TTG-series with non-subduction geochemical signatures. The Kalguty granitoids mostly belong to calc-alkalic to subalkalic high-K series, have non-corundum CIPW-norm compositions and mainly weakly peraluminous (ASI = 0.97-1.09) characteristics. Their Fe* = 0.7-1 at 62-74 wt.% SiO2 and relatively high Y/Nb (2-4) and Rb/Nb (9-18) ratios are similar to transitional compositions reported for fractionated I- and A(z)-type post-orogenic granites worldwide. The Kunush high-Na and Kalguty high-K granitoids formed at different depths in the crust and the parent melts were derived from metabasaltic (MORB; P = 10-15 kbar) and metagranitic (TTG-like; P < 10 kbar) protoliths, respectively. We propose that relaxation of tangential compression after oblique collision and the following thermal impact of mafic magma that acted simultaneously at different crustal depths, along with decompressional partial melting, may be a basic petrological scenario for synchronous formation of geochemically different granitoids.

AB It is generally accepted that the Tianshan was reactivated repeatedly throughout Meso-Cenozoic time. However, the extent of these episodes has not been fully understood. Using a previous magnetostratigraphic baseline, this study reports a detrital zircon U-Pb and apatite fission track dating study along the similar to 4 km thick Cenozoic Jingou River section at the southern margin of the Junggar Basin. Our results provide direct insight into the denudation history of the bordering Tianshan Mountains and suggest that they experienced two phases of rapid cooling in the Jurassic and Cretaceous. These cooling phases are attributed to tectonic events at distant plate margins such as the Late Triassic-Cretaceous accretion of peri-Gondwartan blocks (e.g. Qiangtang and Lhasa). The detrital zircon U-Pb ages range widely from similar to 58 to 3055 Ma with a majority falling between similar to 58 and 600 Ma. They can be statistically separated into two primary age peaks at 300-290 Ma and 450-410 Ma, as well as two secondary peaks at 170 Ma and 850 Ma. Detrital zircon U-Pb dating results suggest that the Central Tianshan may have still shed detritus into the Junggar Basin during the Early Palaeogene. In the Late Oligocene-Early Miocene, the modern North Tianshan started to form a topographic barrier that blocked all northward rivers flowing from the Central Tianshan to the Junggar Basin. Progressive northward indentation of India into Eurasia, caused a final intense phase of cooling and denudation of the Tianshan between similar to 11 and 3 Ma, leading to deposition of the Xiyu Formation, a widely distributed thick conglomerate.

AB The southern Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) in South Mongolia consists of continental fragments sutured together by Paleozoic arc magmatism generated by the closing of the Paleo-Asian Ocean (PAO). Controversy persists regarding the timing and position of the final amalgamation of the Altai and Tianshan orogenic belts. This paper presents zircon U-Pb data of the Gurvan Sayhan accretionary complex, as well as the overlying sedimentary sequence, and a granite pluton intruding the complex to provide new insights into the Late Paleozoic evolution of South Mongolia. The detrital zircon grains from the Gurvan Sayhan accretionary complex yielded age spectra with predominant peaks at ca. 331 Ma, subdominant peaks at ca. 381, and 500 Ma, indistinct Precambrian peaks at ca. 848 Ma and the youngest group of 318 Ma. The Paleozoic zircon grains are interpreted to be derived from adjacent arc systems formed by the subduction of the PAO, whereas those with the Precambrian ages were possibly from the nearby Hangay and South Gobi microcontinent blocks. The proportion of Precambrian detrital zircon grains in the complex decreases with time, likely suggesting a change in the paleogeography during sedimentation of the complex. Detrital zircon grains from the overlying stratum produced an age spectrum characterized by containing the youngest peak at ca. 293 Ma, although older peaks at ca. 340 Ma and 466 Ma are also present. The granite pluton intruding the accretionary complex has an emplacement age of 292.9 +/- 1.3 Ma, similar with the youngest detrital zircon age peak from the overlying stratum, which is interpreted from the post-collisional magmatic rocks. Therefore, our results demonstrate that the final closure of the PAO in southern Mongolia was Late Carboniferous-Early Permian (318-293 Ma), and the Gurvan Sayhan accretionary complex represents the suture zone of the Altai and Tianshan orogenic belts.

AB The Chinese Altai underwent intensive mafic and felsic magmatism in the middle Paleozoic, which was the most important magmatic event in the region. It is still unclear for the role of the event in formation of the crust that is thick (similar to 56 km) and has structure of three-layer stratification. In this study, the data for the middle Paleozoic mafic rocks and granites are comprehensively compiled and integrated with new geochronological, petrological, geochemical and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data for gabbroic rocks from Keketuohai area and tonalite and biotite granites from Habahe area. The middle Paleozoic mafic rocks exhibit two evolutionary trends, which can be defined as high-Al and low-Al types because of their evolution at different crustal levels but mainly at amphibole stability field. The middle Paleozoic I-type granites are mainly metaluminous to weakly peraluminous and were possibly generated by dehydration melting of those mafic rocks evidenced by similar Nd isotopic compositions (epsilon(Nd)(t) = - 2.7 to + 3.8 for granites; epsilon(Nd)(t) = - 2.5 to + 8.5 for the middle Paleozoic mafic rocks). The strongly peraluminous granites show large range in MgO (0.41-3.85 wt%), Cr (5.32-153 ppm) and Ni (3.69-104 ppm), suggesting that they might be produced by dehydration melting of a mixed source composed of materials from the Habahe Group and the middle Paleozoic igneous rocks. The middle Paleozoic I-type and strongly peraluminous granites mostly have high contents of Y and Yb and show low Sr/Y and La/Yb ratios, indicating insignificant residual garnet in the source. The Habahe tonalites (372 +/- 3 Ma) are characterized by positive eNd(t) values ( + 4.7-+ 4.8) and high ((207)pb/(204)pb) t and ((208)pb/Pb-204)(t) ratios, similar to those of the middle Paleozoic mafic rocks. These granites have low contents of MgO (0.50-0.88 wt%), flat rare earth elements (REE) patterns ([La/Yb](N) = 1.1-1.6) and strongly positive Eu anomaly (1.6-2.5), indicating that they were possibly evolved from the high-Al mafic magma through fractionation of Mg-rich minerals. The Habahe biotite granites (359 +/- 4 to 381 +/- 4 Ma) are strongly peraluminous (A/CNK = 1.12-1.23), show concaved REE patterns ([Dy/Yb](N) = 0.90-1.24), and have low (Sr-87/Sr-86); ratios, positive epsilon(Nd)(t) values (+ 1.9 to +5.5) and high (Pb-267/Pb-264), and (Pb-208/Pb-264)(t) ratios. These geochemical features suggest that they were possibly derived from hydrous melting of the middle Paleozoic mafic rocks with residual amphibole at middle crustal level. The middle Paleozoic magmatism recorded the most important period for the crustal differentiation in the Chinese Altai. The evolution of mafic magma and formation of granites mainly occurred within amphibole stability field, illustrating a relatively shallow crustal differentiation process (< 30 km) although the crust may have been thickened.

AB The effective elastic thickness (Te) of the lithosphere, which reflects lithospheric strength, is a useful parameter in the investigation of the characteristics of the oceanic lithosphere. Instead of the conventional spectral method, we used a space-domain convolution method to estimate Te, which involves the convolution of the crustal load with a set of point-loaded response functions in order to get a set of model flexures. The best Te estimate is obtained from the best agreement between the model flexures and the observed flexure derived from the inversion of the gravity data. Compared with the spectral method, this method eliminates the instability problem when the topography is small and increases the spatial resolution of Te. Based on this convolution method, for the first time, we determined Te for the lithosphere in the East and South China Seas and the adjacent area. The result shows that the Bohai Sea, the northern part of the Yellow Sea, the northwestern part of the East China Sea, and the Yinggehai Basin have the strongest lithosphere with a Te reaching 30 km. The central part of the South China Sea and the Okinawa Trough Basin have the weakest lithosphere with a Te of less than 6 km. In addition, we investigate the relationship between Te and the distribution of the crustal load and the relationship between Te and the undulations of the Crust Mantle Interface (CMI). We conclude that the lithospheric strength, Te, decreases with an increase in the sufficient old load. Meanwhile, a positive correlation is found between Te and the CMI. When the CMI becomes deeper or shallower, the corresponding Te becomes larger or smaller, respectively.

AB Graphene and carbon black have been dispersed in a high performance thermoplastic polymer, the poly(ether ketone ketone), to improve its electrical conductivity. The dispersion of graphene has a significant influence on the percolation threshold. A simple exfoliation protocol to obtain graphene monolayers has led to a significant decrease of the percolation threshold from 4.2 to 1.9 vol%. To the best of our knowledge, it is one of the lowest percolation values for unfunctionalized graphene dispersed by melt blending in a high performance thermoplastic matrix. The conductivity value above the percolation threshold (1.2 S.m(-1)) means that graphene was not degraded during the elaboration process. Below the percolation threshold, Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars phenomenon increases the dielectric permittivity from 2.7 to 210 for PEKK/6 vol% graphene at 180 degrees C and 1 Hz. Dynamic mechanical analyses have shown that mechanical moduli were not significantly modified by conductive particles until 6 vol%.

AB Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermomechanical analysis (TMA) were used in conjunction to study thermokinetic behavior of (GeTe4)(y)(GaTe3)(100-y) bulk infrared glasses (for y between 40 and 100). The DSC data were utilized to describe the glass transition and crystallization kinetics in terms of the Tool-Narayanaswamy-Moynihan and Sestak-Berggren models, respectively. The kinetic data are of sufficient quality to enable predictions utilizable for preparation of Ge-Ga-Te ceramics and glass-ceramics. Whereas the compositional evolution of the positions of glass transition and crystallization effects was found to be small, the activation energies obtained for the two processes have shown that in case of the crystallization process the applied heating rate q(+) has large influence on the position of the corresponding kinetic peak on the temperature axis (T-c) and, consequently, on the values of glass stability and glass-forming criteria calculated by using this value. For this reason, a new viscous-flow-related criterion, which utilizes the joint DSC and TMA measurements and is independent from applied q(+), was derived to consider the thermal stability of the glassy materials with regard to their processing (fiber-drawing or shape-molding). Based on the newly developed criteria, the (GeTe4)(67)(GaTe3)(33) glass (positioned near the eutectic) was found to be optimal with respect to the fiber-drawing procedure.

AB The nanocrystallisation behaviour and subsequent intermetallics formation of an amorphous Al-88-Y-4-Ni-8 alloy has been studied. A 1 at.% of Al or Ni was also substituted by Cu and its effect studied. Differential scanning calorimetry has been used to measure the thermal stability of these amorphous alloys. Transmission electron microscopy showed the smaller size of the nanocrystals obtained during primary crystallisation when Cu is added. Using three-dimensional atom probe, it has been checked that Cu is homogeneously distributed in the amorphous matrix, not contributing to a heterogeneous nucleation around Cu clusters during the formation of nanocrystals. Transmission electron microscopy and X-rays diffraction are used to study the controversial intermetallics occurrence at higher temperatures. The sequence and characteristics of the intermetallics appearing in these alloys were sensitive to the presence of Cu. The evolution of these intermetallics, up to 600 degrees C, has been studied. Findings are compared with previous studies.

AB Composites of dicalcium silicate cement (C2S), prepared by solid state reaction, were fabricated with 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt% additions of borosilicate glass (BG) prepared by melt-quenching method. Bioactivity behavior of the cement and its composites was estimated by soaking in simulated body fluid (SBF) at 37 +/- 0.5 degrees C for 28 days. Physico-mechanical properties of the cement and its composites were measured. The variations of pH, Ca and P ions concentrations in the SBF solution after soaking were determined. Additionally, the structure was analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Evaluation of the cytotoxicity against human normal fibroplast cell line (BJ1) was also carried out. Results showed the formation of hydroxyapatite (HA) layer on the surface of investigated materials after immersion in SBF solution. It can be pointed out that increasing BG content in the present cement composition enhances the mechanical properties and the bioactivity behavior of the cement. Moreover, with increasing the content of BG in cement, the cytotoxicity effect decreases, making these materials possible candidates for dental applications.

AB Radiation shielding characteristics of different germanate glasses with compositions of Nd doped Bi2O3-SiO2/GeO2-Nd2O3, Sm3+ doped B2O3-GeO2-Gd2O3, Tb-3 doped GeO2-B2O3-SiO2-Ga2O3, TeO2-GeO2-Li2O and Na2O-GeO2-P2O5 glasses have been studied using XCOM program at several photon energies between 0.015 and 10 MeV. Dependencies of their photon attenuation properties with the photon energy and the composition have been investigated. The mass attenuation coefficient values and the effective atomic numbers for Nd doped Bi2O3-SiO2/GeO2-Nd(2)O(3)glasses are higher than those of the other samples. 69Bi(2)O(3)-30GeO(2)-1.0Nd(2)O(3) has the highest mass attenuation coefficients among the selected samples. The Z(eff) results revealed that to increase the photon attenuation ability for the germanate glasses, high Z-elements (such as Bi, Te and Tb) in a suitable concentration must be included. The HVL results for the present germanate glasses suggested that the attenuation capacity of the gamma photons increases as the density of the sample increases, hence, the glass sample with high density must be considered for high attenuation ability. Also, the significant influence of modifier contents on the HVL values namely the attenuation ability has been noticed for Tb-3 doped GeO2-B2O3-SiO2-Ga2O3 and TeO2-Li2O-GeO2 glasses. Moreover, the values of the mean free path for the selected samples have been compared with those of different radiation shielding glasses and concrete samples.

Structural data from B-11, Al-27 and Si-29 NMR analyses show that increasing the [B2O3]/([Al2O3] + [B2O3]) ratio of the alkali-alkaline-earth aluminoborosilicate glasses led to an overall decrease in the proportion of non-silicate tetrahedral species (Al-IV + B-IV) and a decrease in Si-O-X bonds(X=B, Al). The Mg-containing glasses exhibited lower B-IV fractions than their Ca-containing counterparts, which is thought to be due to the presence of Mg-IV tetrahedra in the network. The measured corrosion rates were similar for both Ca and Mg-containing glasses although unexpectedly some Ca-containing glasses exhibited higher corrosion losses than the Mg-containing ones for time periods up to 112 d. However, there was evidence of a greater tendency to rate resumption in the Mg containing than the Ca containing ones. Alteration products were found to contain Ca, Si and Al with the Ca containing glasses and Ca, Mg, Si and Al with the Mg containing glasses; Na was not detected in the alteration products although its presence cannot be ruled out based on the data obtained.

AB Yb3+, Yb3+/Al3+, Yb3+/P5+, and Yb3+/Al3+/P5+ doped silica glasses were prepared via the sol-gel method combined with high-temperature sintering. The amorphous nature of as-prepared glasses was confirmed by the X-ray diffraction analysis. The composition dependent ultraviolet (UV) absorption changes in the glasses were correlated with the local structure of Yb3+ ions that was obtained by pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). In situ photoluminescence evolution and continuous wave EPR spectrum of color centers induced by a 193-nm UV laser were recorded, and the role of UV absorption bands in the photodarkening process was discussed. The results indicated that the strong UV absorption bands in the range of 190-290 nm were primarily attributed to the charge-transfer (CT) transition from O2- to Yb3+ and the position of CT bands shifted to a higher energy level with increases in the electronegativity of next nearest neighbor atoms (Al/Si/P) of Yb3+ ions. Furthermore, the results revealed that excitation into the CT bands leads to the generation of oxygen hole centers and Yb2+ ions. The study is useful for understanding the underlying mechanism of photodarkening in Yb3+-doped high-power laser fibers.

AB Nickel doped Bismuth Borate glasses with composition (70B(2)O(3)-(30-x)Bi2O3-xNiO) where x = 0,0.5,1.0,1.5,2.0 (wt%) have been synthesized by conventional melt quenching technique. X-Ray Diffractograms have confirmed the amorphous nature of the prepared glasses. The calculated physical parameters such as density, molar volume, average boron-boron separation, ion concentration and inter ionic distance provided the information about the structural stability of glass samples. DTA and OPD confirmed the decrease in glass transition temperature (T-g) with increase in Ni content. The FTIR and Raman studies clearly revealed that the glass network mainly comprises of [BiO3], [BiO6], [BO3] and [BO4] units. It is also observed that the introduction of dopant (Ni) and modifier (Bi) leads to the conversion of [BO3] trigonal units into the (BO4) tetragonal units due to the increase in non-bridging oxygen atoms which results in the increase of degree of disorder in the glass network. The optical absorption measurements (UV) carried out for well polished glass samples show a decrease in optical band gap with the increase in Ni doping. This observation was further supported by the urbach energy calculations and metallization criterion of the prepared glass samples. The electronegativity and electronic polarizability values revealed the ionic character of glass samples.

AB Incorporated titanium oxide to bioglasses with novel composition as: 40P2O5- 20Na2O- 10Ca(OH)2-20CaCl2-8.0ZnO- 1.0TiO2 (labeled BGTi) was tested for its antimicrobial activity, anti-proliferative/cytotoxicity against normal and activated splenic cells in vitro, anticancer activity, in vivo immunologic and hypersensitivity responses, in vivo and in vitro cytotoxicity effects and in vitro effects of activated splenic cells on BGTi. These results showed that BGTi had antimicrobial activities against Gram negative and positive bacteria as well as fungi. The prepared bioglasses BGTi had no cytotoxic or proliferative effects on activated splenic cells while showed anti-proliferative/cytotoxicity against normal splenic cells. It was cytotoxic to HepG2 cells. In vivo test demonstrated that BGTi is an inert material which did not stimulate the immune system or caused local reactions. The products of activated splenic cells did not cause any changes in the structure of BGTi also it did not cause any acute cytotoxicity or lysis to RBCs. TiO2 is an inert material which did not cause immune stimulation or hepatic cytotoxicity. BGTi did not affect by lytic products of immune cells hence, it can be considered as a safe and ideal material for implantation inside the body of living organisms. Finally we investigated the structure of the bioglasses BGTi by using Raman spectra.

AB Speciation of sulphate ions in sodium alumino(iron)phosphate glasses was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), infrared and Raman spectroscopy. The high-sulphate glasses are subject to devitrification segregating minor sodium sulphates. As followed from SEM data iron-bearing glasses were higher homogeneous than the iron-free glasses. Vibrational (IR and Raman) spectra demonstrated occurrence of some bands typical of vibrations of S-O bonds in the sulphate ions: 620-640 cm(-1) (v(4) SO4 in IR spectra) and similar to 460-470 (v(2)), similar to 620-640 (v(4)), 967-1008 (v(1)) and similar to 1105-1130 cm(-1) (v(3)) in the Raman spectra. This exhibits that the sulphate ions have been shown to maintain their identity being independent in the aluminophosphate glass network. Sulfur leach rate is associated with that for sodium due to formation of a sodium sulphate enriched areas in the glasses.

AB Materials such as ceramic matrix composites are developed for mechanical applications at high temperature, but their cost remains a limitation. Consequently, the use of acid-based geopolymer matrices may be an alternative to reduce costs.
   In this study, the sample was prepared from metakaolin and phosphoric acid. Fourier Transform InfraRed and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopies, X-Ray Diffraction and thermal measurements were used to understand the structural evolution of acid-based geopolymers (binders) during consolidation and after thermal treatments.
   According to the results, the consolidation of the binder has been divided into four steps: the dissolution of the metakaolin, the polycondensation reactions forming AlPO4 entities and hydrated phases, the breakdown of Si-O-Al bonds with formation of various hydrated silica networks and finally the completion of the networks. After a thermal treatment at 1000 degrees C, the binder consists of AlPO4 phases, quartz and vitreous silica.

ID REFRACTIVE-INDEX
AB The classical molecular dynamics simulation of the glancing angle deposition of silicon dioxide films with practically meaningful dimensions is performed. The formation of separated slanted columnar structures is investigated for different deposition angles and different energies of sputtered silicon atoms. It is shown that a decrease in the angle between the flux of deposited atoms and the normal to the substrate leads to the decrease of column thicknesses and distances between the columns. The high-energy deposition with small deposition angles results in the formation of dense films without separate columnar structures. The increase of substrate temperature leads to partial merging of nearby columns. The glancing angle deposition with low energies of sputtered silicon atoms results in the growth of disordered columns with different dimensions, shapes, and tilt angles. Annealing of high-energy glancing angle deposited films results in partial merging of slanted columns. The obtained simulation results are in a good agreement with existing experimental data.

AB The electrical conductivity and dielectric characteristics of gadolinium doped lithium diborate samples were analysed by the impedance spectroscopic method in temperature and frequency range of 393 K-573 K and 100 Hz-5 MHz respectively. Obtained dc activation energy values with Arrhenius plots vary non-linearly with Gd3+ ions. Increase in dielectric loss and dielectric permittivity were observed with temperature variation and results were analysed on the basis of frequency dependent electron hopping in addition to the electron polarization. Modified KWW model was fitted on account of asymmetric nature in the frequency response of shape parameters. The imaginary part of complex electric modulus obtained from the fit were found to be consistent with glass composition. The conductivity modulus was reasonably fitted with stretched exponential relaxation functions and the stretched exponential values were found to be independent of temperature.

AB A review of recent progress in optical recording of surface relief structures in the films of two classes of photoresponsive non-crystalline materials (azobenzene-containing polymers and amorphous chalcogenides) is presented. Various aspects related to light-driven macroscopic effects for these materials where stimulated surface patterning through selective mass transport process due to the interaction of matter with polarized light are discussed. Self-assembling processes initiated by polarized light illumination resulting in the formation of multiscale periodic reliefs on the photosensitive material surface are analyzed. Extensive experimental data describing different aspects of photomanipulated surface relief patterning using vectorial optical fields and structured light beams are summarized. Anisotropic nanoscale motion in amorphous azopolymer and chalcogenide films induced by a tightly focused polarized laser beam is considered. Similarities and differences in the manifestation of competition and cooperation between polarization-driven and intensity-driven mechanisms responsible for material displacement in chalcogenide glasses and amorphous azopolymers are analyzed. Possibilities for optimization and speeding up the process of holographic recording of periodic relief gratings in amorphous azopolymer and chalcogenide films at various configurations for combination of optical beams to produce 2D and 3D relief architecture on the film surface are discussed.

AB Na-Fe-Al-P-O-N glasses have been successfully prepared by melting batches at 1050-1150 degrees C under N-2 atmosphere. The amorphous nature of the Na-Fe-Al-P-O-N glasses was verified by an X-ray diffractometer. The structural changes of the glasses were investigated by Raman and infrared spectroscopy. As Fe2O3 increases, the structural change is attributed to the significant effect of Fe3+ ions on the phosphate network in the glasses. The thermal behaviors of the glasses were studied by DSC methods. As Fe2O3 gradually replaces Al2O3, the crystallization tendency of these glasses increases. The chemical durability of the glasses is assessed by measuring the dissolution rate. As the Fe2O3 content increases, the overall trend of the chemical durability is first lowered and then increased. The conductivity of the glasses varied greatly with the Fe2O3 content in the frequency range used. The activation energy (E-ac decreases from 59.8 to 45.7 kJ mol(-1) with increasing Fe2O3 content.

AB Boro-tellurite glasses have recently been attracting the attention of several researchers as a tremendous optical device and shielding material. In this work, boro-tellurite glasses with bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) have been synthesized by melt quenching technique. The structural and shielding property changes after adding of bismuth oxide in boro-tellurite glass were studied using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Lead Equivalent Thickness measurement (LET), respectively. The results show that the bismuth oxide increases glass density, changes the glass structure, and increases the radiation shielding properties. Changes in the glass structure are due to atomic rearrangements and formation of non-bridging oxygen (NBO). The density of boro-tellurite glass system increased up to 97% when Bi2O3 content increased, which is due to the high molecular weight of Bi2O3 and the increasing number of NBO atoms in the glass structure. In addition, the mass attenuation coefficient of the glass system increases as Bi2O3 concentration increases and the half value layer and mean free path show that present glass better than some standard concretes and commercial radiation shielding glasses. Current results demonstrated the advantages of bismuth-boro-tellurite glass as a new candidate of gamma radiation shielding material in selected energy range.

AB Preparation of lithium disilicate glass-ceramics was attempted via solid-state reaction between Li2SiO3 crystals and SiO2 glass. By addition of 0.5 mol Li2Si2O5 glass as binding, the mixtures were hot-pressing sintered at 840 degrees C for 1 h. The effect of SiO2 contents (1-2 mol) on the reaction sintering behavior, microstructure and mechanical properties of Li2Si2O5 glass-ceramics was studied. Part of SiO2 glass crystallized to quartz so that at least 1.5 mol SiO2 was needed for the complete reaction with the 1 mol LM crystals. The grain size of Li2Si2O5 crystals increased with increasing the SiO2 content depending on the degree of reaction. The flexural strength and fracture toughness of the samples both increased firstly then decreased with the increasing SiO2. After reaction, rod-like Li2Si2O5 crystals of tens microns long could be obtained, which were several times longer than the directly crystallized ones from the parent glass. Such reaction formed large Li2Si2O5 crystals apparently had an effective toughening effect without sacrificing other properties. Due to the complete reaction of 1 mol Li2SiO3 crystals by 1.5 mol SiO2 glass in the specimens of M1S1.5D0.5, high flexural strength of 373 +/- 12 MPa and improved fracture toughness of 3.35 +/- 0.12 MPa.m(1/2) were obtained. The improved properties were attributed mainly to crack deflexion and grain-bridging toughening mechanisms.

AB Nd3+-doped mixed-anion fluoro-sulfo-phosphate (FPS) glass has been investigated as a laser material in detail. It is found that anion-mixing in Al(PO3)(3)-BaF2-BaSO4 glass system enables excellent physical properties and chemical durability. Besides, the complicated local environment provided by multi-component leads to high radiative transition probability and influences other luminescent properties considerably. The measured lifetime of Nd3+: F-4(3/2) in FPS is 349.8 mu s and the quantum efficiency is 92.91%, higher than those of phosphate and fluoro-phosphate glasses. These results suggest that the FPS glass system could be a promising candidate for 1.06 mu m laser source.

AB The glass-forming domain, density, thermal, structural and optical properties of new glasses within the TeO2-NbO2.5-WO3 system have been investigated. By means of Raman spectroscopy, a thorough structural analysis of these glasses has been undertaken on the basis of a full-scale spectral decomposition process. The optical transmission window, refractive index dispersion and third-order nonlinear susceptibilities chi((3)) were measured by UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry and Z-scan method respectively. Consistent correlations are successfully established between the measured structural, linear and nonlinear optical properties. In general, the structural features of the glass network are found to evolve mildly upon adding NbO2.5 or WO3. Nonetheless, a weak structural depolymerization of the Te-O-Te bond network as a result of adding NbO2.5 is evidenced and discussed in detail. Upon continuous addition of NbO2.5 and/or WO3, the glass network becomes progressively richer in NbO2.5-rich and/or WO3-rich regions before the crystallization of Nb6TeO17 (NbO2.5:TeO2 ratio of 6:1) and WO2.83 compounds respectively. The studied glasses exhibit high linear refractive indices with an average of similar to 2.13 and very high third-order nonlinear susceptibilities chi((3)) with an average of 5.48 (star)10(-13) esu (similar to 37 times higher than that of SiO2 glass).

AB The present investigation aims at evaluating the Glass Forming Ability (GFA), density (rho) and equilibrium melting point (T-0) of Ta(W/Hf)-Ni-B based bulk metallic glass (BMG) alloy system. Initially, the theoretical GFA, based on thermodynamic parameters P-HSS, rho th, based on rule of mixture of volume and T(0)th, using Thermo-cal software for all alloy systems have been calculated and then mapped in Ta-Ni-B, Ta(W)-Ni-B and Ta(Hf)-Ni-B diagrams respectively. Maps for individual alloy system were then superimposed based on high GFA (< -5 kJ/mol), high density (> 13 g/cc) and low melting point (< 1400 degrees C). A series of compositions of ternary TaxNiyBz, (where x = 46, 47, y = 44, 45 and z = 8, 9, 10 at.%) and quaternary Ta50Ni(49.5-uWuB0.5, (where u = 1, 2, 3, 5 at.%) and Ta(50-v)Ni(50-w)Hf(v+w-0.5)B0.5(where v = 7, 9 and w = 8,10 at.%) alloys have been selected based on the intersections of overlapped P-HSS, rho th and T(0)th regions in respective superimposed diagrams and subsequently considered for conducting experiments for validation. All these alloys of selected compositions were first cast from elemental mixture, followed by processing through rapid solidification route to produce ribbons and characterizing for structural and thermal analyses. It reveals that crystalline phases exist along with amorphous phase in TaxNiyBz alloys, whereas completely amorphous phase can be observed in quaternary Ta50Ni(49.5-u)WuB0.5, and Ta(50-v)Ni(50-w)Hf(v+w-0.5)B0.5 alloy systems. B has detrimental effect for the formation of glassy phase, whereas W bearing Ta-Ni-B alloys have higher GFA as compared to that of Hf bearing Ta-Ni-B alloys. The experimental results are also corroborated with the theoretical prediction.

AB The comprehensive characteristics of Fe71-xErxNb6B23 (x = 0, 1, 3, 5, 7 at.%) bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), including the thermal properties, glass-forming ability, magnetocaloric effect and mechanical properties were investigated. As a result, with increasing Er content up to 5 at.%, the supercooled liquid region increases to 90 K, and BMG with a critical diameter of 4 mm is fabricated by copper mold casting. The regulation of Curie temperature is achieved by controlling the amount of Er. The resulting glass alloy system exhibits Curie temperature of 340-550 K, magnetic entropy change of 0.74-1.41 J/kg K, and refrigerant capacity of 56-112 J/kg in external magnetic field of 1.5 T. Moreover, the Fe71-xErxNb6B23 BMGs exhibit high saturation magnetic flux density of 0.43-1.09 T, high fracture strength of 3.09-4.65 GPa and high Vickers hardness of 1030-1090 kg/mm(2), respectively. Considering these good overall characteristics, this glass alloy system can be employed as magnetic refrigerant materials in temperature range of 340-550 K.

The effect of variation in wt% of Bi24B2O9 crystalline phase on 20SrO center dot 55Bi(2)O(3)center dot 25B(2)O(3) (SBB) and 2OBaO center dot 55Bi(2)O(3)center dot 25B(2)O(3) (BBB) glasses has been investigated. The sintered density of the glass samples were characterized by Archimedes' method. The X-ray Diffraction method, Fourier Transform -Infrared (FT-IR) spectra and FT- Raman spectra are used for structural investigations, whereas Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis is used for the microstructural study. The effect of the Bi24B2O39 crystalline phase as filler in the glass network is confirmed from the FT-IR and FT -Raman spectra. The dielectric properties of the selected samples, analyzed using an Impedance analyzer, show that the dielectric constant slightly increases with increase in the wt% of Bi24B2O39 crystalline phase on glasses and the BBB glasses show higher dielectric values than the SBB glasses. The glass ceramic composites show low sintering temperature (< 650 degrees C), dielectric constant in the range 10-16 and dielectric loss of 0.0069, suggesting that they can be used as promising candidates for Ultra Low Temperature Cofired Ceramic Applications(ULTCC).

AB During development of a method of fabricating fluoride glass preforms for drawing into optical fibres, in which core and cladding glasses are in intimate contact, back-scattered electron imaging revealed two distinct layers in the interface between the two glasses. The compositions of the two layers were found to be different from each other and different from either core or cladding glass. The compositions of these layers and of adjacent glasses were analysed using electron probe microanalysis and wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EPMA/WDS). Back-scattered electron imaging (BEI) was used to make a reasonable qualitative estimate of lithium distribution in the glasses, which could not be measured by EPMA/WDS. As part of a study of the nature of interfaces in glasses, possible mechanisms of formation for such interfacial layers and the effects of the different compositions on properties such as viscosity, refractive index, glass stability and fibre performance are discussed.

AB Since increasing Ti content in Ti-based metallic glasses would benefit their specific strength, developing Ti-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) with high Ti content has drawn great attention of researchers. However, excessive Ti content usually deteriorates their glass forming ability (GFA), especially for Ti-based BMGs with Ti content higher than 50 at.%. Here, based on the Ti55Zr15Be20Ni10 BMG with a critical diameter of 5 mm, the (Ti55Zr15Be20Ni10)(100--x) Fe-x alloys were designed and investigated. The (Ti55Zr15Be20Ni10)(96)Fe-4 BMG exhibited a critical diameter of 10 mm, suggesting GFA of the Ti55Zr15Be20Ni10 BMG could be improved by Fe addition. In addition, their yield strength increased with Fe addition, thus the specific strength was enhanced from 3.98 x 10(5) N m/kg to 4.46 x 10(5) N m/kg, providing the most optimal scheme of specific strength and GFA among the reported Ti-based BMGs. The developed BMGs exhibited high pitting potentials in 3.5 wt.% NaCl aqueous solution, which were 1.8 similar to 2.8 times higher than that of 304 stainless steel. The present result shows that the developed Ti-based BMGs containing high Ti content, combined with high specific strength, large glass forming ability and good corrosion resistance, are promising for applications requring lightweight alloys.

AB Effectively eutrophication control and phosphate recovery have received increasing attention in recent years. In this study, a regenerable magnetic NaLa(CO3)(2)/Fe3O4 composites (MLC) which includes a novel phosphate-binding lanthanum species NaLa(CO3)(2) hybridized with Fe3O4 nanoparticle was developed through a modified solvothermal method for phosphate removal from contaminated water. Based upon preliminary screening of synthesized MLC with different La-to-Fe molar ratios in terms of phosphate adsorption capacity and synthetic product yield, a MLC composite with a La-to-Fe molar ratio of 2:1 (MLC-21) was selected for further characterization and evaluation. MLC-21 exhibits a high magnetic separation efficiency of 97%, high phosphate adsorption capacity of 77.85 mg P/g, wide applicable scope of pH ranging from 4 to 11, excellent selectivity for phosphate in the presence of competing ions (Cl-, NO3-, HCO3-, SO42-, Ca2+, and Mg2+), good reusability with above 98% desorption efficiency using NaO-H-NaCl mixture and 83% adsorption capacity remained during five recycles. Furthermore, a real effluent wastewater with phosphate concentration of 1.96 mg P/L was used to verify the performance of MLC-21 through a magnetic separation integrated system (AMSS). By using the response surface methodology (RSM), the optimum parameters were determined to be 0.26 g/L of adsorbent dosage, 26.28 h of adsorption time and 24.12 min of magnetic separation time for meeting the phosphate emission standard of 0.5 mg P/L The phosphorus in three representative eutrophic water bodies can be efficiently reduced to below 0.1 mg P/L by MLC-21 adsorption at different dosages. Electrostatic attraction and the inner-sphere complexation between La(HCO3)(2)(+)/La(CO3)(2)(-) and P via ligand exchange forming LaPO4 were responsible for the phosphate adsorption mechanisms of MLC.

AB Stringent phosphorus discharge standards (i.e. 0.15-0.3 g P.m(-3)) in the Baltic area will compel wastewater treatment practice to augment enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) with chemical precipitation using metal salts. This study examines control of iron chemical dosing for phosphorus removal under dynamic loading conditions to optimize operational aspects of a membrane biological reactor (MBR) pilot plant. An upgraded version of the Benchmark Simulation Model No. 2 (BSM2) with an improved physico-chemical framework (PCF) is used to develop a plant-wide model for the pilot plant. The PCF consists of an equilibrium approach describing ion speciation and pairing, kinetic minerals precipitation (such as hydrous ferric oxides (HFO) and FePO4) as well as adsorption and co-precipitation. Model performance is assessed against data sets from the pilot plant, evaluating the capability to describe water and sludge lines across the treatment process under steady-state operation. Simulated phosphorus differed as little as 5-10% (relative) from measured phosphorus, indicating that the model was representative of reality. The study also shows that environmental factors such as pH, as well operating conditions such as Fe/P molar ratios (1, 1.5 and 2), influence the concentration of dissolved phosphate in the effluent. The time constant of simultaneous precipitation in the calibrated model, due to a step change decrease/increase in FeSO4 dosage, was found to be roughly 5 days, indicating a slow dynamic response due to a multi-step process involving dissolution, oxidation, precipitation, aging, adsorption and co-precipitation. The persistence effect of accumulated iron-precipitates (HFO particulates) in the activated sludge seemed important for phosphorus removal, and therefore solids retention time plays a crucial role according to the model. The aerobic tank was deemed to be the most suitable dosing location for FeSO4 addition, due to high dissolved oxygen levels and good mixing conditions. Finally, dynamic model-based analyses show the benefits of using automatic control when dosing chemicals. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mathematical models describing precipitation processes in one step need to be upgraded. Particle size distribution is a crucial variable and its inclusion in the modelling libraries is necessary if the technology wants to be optimized through simulation. With this objective, a mass based population balance model is presented in this contribution. The model has been constructed using a stoichiometric matrix and a kinetic vector and using mass as the internal coordinate, as it is usually done in wastewater treatment modelling. Identifiability of the parameters of the model was evaluated using a sensitivity and a collinearity analysis for six simulation case studies of struvite precipitation. In addition, parameters in the model were calibrated to represent data from two batch tests in the laboratory. The results of the analysis showed that the identifiability of the parameters depends on the available experimental data and explored scenarios. Identifiability of the parameters could be the reason behind the shifting parameter values describing mechanisms of precipitation in the literature. This contribution helps to understand the possibilities and limitations that the population balance model approach offer. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Concentration and fraction distribution of organics and heavy metals in municipal sludge treated by modified phosphogypsum and acetic acid (signed as MPG/HAC) were studied. The results showed that MPG/HAC conditioning significantly produce synergistic enhancement effect to dissolution of unstable heavy metals wrapped in the stable colloid network. Simultaneously, after conditioning, about 45.16% of organics such as proteins, polysaccharides and humic acid in supernatant was degraded, thus dissociating large amount of active group which accelerated immobilization of dissolved heavy metals and weaken its toxicity. In addition, MPG with a porous structure could adsorb unstable heavy metals and transform them into residual fraction, leading to a considerable decrease in their mobility risk level. Besides, linear regression models showed that a strong oxidizability of sludge, and destruction of colloidal network could greatly promote dissolution of unstable heavy metals. Simultaneously, sludge oxidizability and organics degradation rate, and disintegration of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) layer highly accelerate immobilization of unstable metals. Excepting Cd, environmental risk of Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni and As can be effectively weakened after conditioning. Additionally, MPG/HAC conditioning might be appropriate for stabilization of Cd, Cr and Zn in water supply sludge, especially for Zn. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Amine-containing pharmaceuticals such as acetaminophen, diclofenac, and sulfamethoxazole are the most often detected pharmaceuticals in wastewater and other aquatic environments. Amine-containing pharmaceuticals can be effectively removed by chlorination. These drugs, however, may coexist in wastewater. Thus, they may compete with each other, and their chlorinated products may react with each other to form new products. In this study, competitive effects of the above three amine-containing pharmaceuticals by chlorination and their products were investigated. The priority of chlorination of these compounds was dependent upon the pH of the solution, due to the dissociation of the compounds and hypochlorite. It followed the order of sulfamethoxazole > diclofenac > acetaminophen in an acidic condition, the order of sulfamethoxazole > acetaminophen > diclofenac in a neutral condition, and the order of sulfamethoxazole approximate to acetaminophen > diclofenac in an alkaline condition. Some of the chlorinated products in single- and multiple-compound systems were the same. Dimers of sulfamethoxazole and its chlorinated products, however, were not found, but dimers of sulfamethoxazole and acetaminophen or diclofenac were found in multiple-compound systems. This finding is important because it means that new products may be produced if different amine-containing pharmaceuticals react with free chlorine simultaneously. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Superfine powdered activated carbon (SPAC) of micron to submicron particle size is produced by micro-milling of conventionally sized powdered activated carbon. SPAC has attracted attention because of its high adsorption capacity; however, milling to the submicron particle size range lowers its adsorption capacity. Here, we found that this decrease of adsorption capacity was due to the introduction of oxygen/hydrogen-containing functional groups into the graphene structure of the carbon from water during the milling, causing it to become less hydrophobic. This finding was supported by three analyses of SPAC particles before and after milling: 1) elemental analysis revealed increased oxygen and hydrogen content, 2) Boehm titration analysis revealed increased amounts of acidic functional groups, including carboxylic and phenolic hydroxyl groups, and 3) Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed increased peaks at 1200, 1580, and 3400 cm(-1), confirming the presence of those groups. Dissolved oxygen concentration did not strongly affect the increase of oxygen content in SPAC, and no evidence was found for hydroxyl radical production during micro-milling, suggesting that a mechanochemical reaction underlies the increase in oxygen/hydrogen-containing functional groups. An increase in O-18 content in the SPAC particles after milling in water-O-18 indicated that the oxygen in the functional groups originated from the surrounding water. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Water recovery is a measure of the amount of treated water produced relative to the total amount of water processed through the system, and is an important performance metric for any desalination method. Conventional operating methods for desalination using capacitive deionization (CDI) have so far limited water recovery to be about 50%. To improve water recovery for CDI, we here introduce a new operating scheme based on a variable (in time) flow rate wherein a low flow rate during discharge is used to produce a brine volume which is significantly less than the volume of diluent produced. We demonstrate experimentally and study systematically this novel variable flowrate operating scheme in the framework of both constant current and constant voltage charge-discharge modes. We show that the variable flowrate operation can increase water recovery for CDI to very high values of similar to 90% and can improve thermodynamic efficiency by about 2- to 3-fold compared to conventional constant flowrate operation. Importantly, this is achieved with minimal performance reductions in salt removal, energy consumption, and volume throughput. Our work highlights that water recovery can be readily improved for CDI at very minimal additional cost using simple flow control schemes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, harmful algal blooms capable of producing toxins including microcystins, cylindrospermopsin, and saxitoxin have increased in occurrence and severity. These toxins can enter drinking water treatment plants and, if not effectively removed, pose a serious threat to human health. The work here investigated the efficacy of permanganate oxidation as a treatment strategy, with a focus on incorporating competition by cyanobacterial cells and dissolved organic matter (DOM). We report rate constants of 272 +/- 23 M-1 s(-1) for the reaction between permanganate and microcystin-LR, 0.26 +/- 0.05 M-1 s(-1) for the reaction between permanganate and cylindrospermopsin, and, using chemical analogs, estimate a maximum rate constant of 2.7 +/- 0.2 M-1 s(-1) for the reaction between permanganate and saxitoxin. We conclude that permanganate only shows potential to remove microcystins. No pH (6-10) or alkalinity (0-50 mM) dependence was observed for the rate of reaction between microcystin-LR and permanganate; however, a temperature dependence was observed and can be characterized by an activation energy of 16 +/- 5 kJ mol(-1). The competition posed by cyanobacterial cells was quantified by an apparent second order rate constant of 2.5 +/- 0.3 x 10(-6) L mu g chl-a(-1) s(-1). From this apparent second order rate constant, it was concluded that cyanobacterial cells are not efficient scavengers of permanganate within typical contact times but this second order rate constant can be used to accurately predict microcystin degradation in algal-impacted waters. The competition posed by DOM depended on both the amount of DOM present (as measured by TOC) and its electron donating capacity (as predicted by SUVA-254 or E2/E3 ratio). DOM was concluded to scavenge permanganate efficiently and we forward that this should be considered in permanganate dosing calculations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pre-oxidation is effective in enhancing sludge dewaterability. Different types and doses of oxidants are used to improve sludge dewaterability in pre-oxidation. Rapid evaluation of the sludge dewaterability is vital for optimizing the type and dose of oxidants in pre-oxidation. It normally takes more time to evaluate sludge dewaterability by measuring typical indicators such as specific resistance to filtration (SRF), content of bound water, and composition of EPS. This study presented a rapid parameter, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), to correlate it with the dewaterability of pre-oxidized sludge samples. An index of Delta ORP (Delta ORP = ORPt=0.5 (min)-ORPt=0 (min)) showed positive correlations with SRF (r = 0.89, p < 0.05), content of total organic carbon in soluble and loosely-bound EPS (r = 0.86 and 0.84, p < 0.05), zeta potential (r = 0.86, p < 0.05), and content of Fe(III) in the sludge cake (r = 0.92, p < 0.01). However, the Delta ORP index showed negative correlations with tryptophan-like proteins, tyrosine-like proteins, microbial byproduct-like materials in tightly-bound EPS (r = -0.85, -0.90 and -0.90, p < 0.05), and sludge particle sizes (p < 0.01). A multiple linear regression model was developed to further reflect the linear correlation between the Delta ORP values and the key factors reflecting sludge dewaterability. An optimal dose of oxone (0.4 mmol/g VS) for sludge pre-oxidation with the Delta ORP value of 387 mV combined with Fe(III) coagulation conditioning system were verified by the results of dewatering experiments using a laboratory-scale diaphragm filter press. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using Delta ORP as a potential rapid evaluation tool for sludge dewaterability. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although reverse osmosis produces high quality reusable water from wastewater the rejected concentrate (ROC) poses potentially serious health hazards to non-target species. This is especially the case when it is disposed into aquatic environments due to the presence of high concentrations of dissolved natural organics, micro-organic pollutants (MOPS) and other pollutants. In batch and column studies we found that granular activated carbon (GAC) was very effective in simultaneously removing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 18 MOPs from ROC. The amounts of all DOC fractions adsorbed (0.01-3 mg/g) were much higher than those of the MOPs (0.01-2.5 mu g/g) mainly because ROC contained larger concentrations of DOC fractions than MOPs. However, the partition coefficient which is a measure of the adsorbability was higher for most of the MOPs (0.21-21.6 L/g) than for the DOC fractions (0.01-0.45 L/g). The amount of DOC fraction adsorbed was in the order: humics > low molecular weights > building blocks > biopolymers (following mostly their concentrations in ROC). The partition coefficient was in the order: low molecular weigth nuetrals > humics > building blocks > biopolymers. The MOPs were classified into four groups based on their hydrophobicity (log Kow) and charge. The four positively charged MOPs with high hydrophobicity had the highest amounts adsorbed and partition coefficient, with 95-100% removal in the GAC column. The MOPs that are negatively charged, regardless of their hydrophobicity, had the lowest amounts adsorbed and partition coefficient with 73-94% removal. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Evaluating the activity of extracellular and intracellular enzymes derived from wastewater microbial communities is essential to improve our fundamental understanding of micropollutant removal during wastewater treatment. To study biotransformations with respect to enzyme biogeography, we developed a method to separate soluble extracellular, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS)-bound, and intracellular enzymes from wastewater microbial communities and assessed the protease and peptidase activity of the resulting enzyme pools. We also evaluated the biotransformation of six antibiotics (amoxicillin, ampicillin, clindamycin, daptomycin, linezolid, and vancomycin) in each enzyme pool because we expect that the kinetics, pathways, and biogeography of antibiotic biotransformations influence the selection of antibiotic resistance within wastewater microbial communities and in downstream environments. Our results demonstrated that biotransformation rate constants varied among the tested antibiotics, and that the observed rank order was consistent across three wastewater treatment plants. Importantly, many of the observed biotransformations eliminated the functional groups associated with antibiotic activity. Furthermore, we found that beta-lactam hydrolysis and daptomycin hydrolysis were catalyzed by enzymes extracted from the EPS, while none of the tested antibiotics were biotransformed by soluble extracellular enzymes. Finally, our results demonstrated that the number of enzyme-catalyzed antibiotic transformations was larger for intracellular than for extracellular enzymes. Together, this study provides novel insights on the kinetics, pathways, and biogeography of antibiotic biotransformations performed by wastewater microbial communities and can be used to inform pathway prediction or the development of biodegradable chemicals.

AB Disinfection processes were applied in reclaimed water plant to eliminate pathogens and control the related health risk during water reuse. However, extra problems might emerge such as the released free endotoxins from the ruptured cell wall of gram-negative bacteria. Endotoxins can induce lung inflammatory responses after inhalation, which has been neglected in the water quality regulation, and the removal of endotoxin was not under consideration in the process of reclamation. In the present study, two well-known disinfection processes, chlorination and combined UV/chlorine (UV/Cl-2), were performed to test the removal efficiency of endotoxin activity, as well as the inflammation inducing ability. In the pure LPS solution, UV/Cl-2 treatment significantly reduced both endotoxin activity and lung inflammation responses with better oxidizability of the generated hydroxyl radical. However, its performance on bacteria liquid and real secondary effluent was more complicated. The cell wall-bound LPS have lower endotoxin activities and inflammation inducing ability. Immediately after the cell wall was destroyed, the bound LPS were released to the solution to be free LPS, which dramatically increased both the endotoxin activity and inflammation inducing ability of the water. When these free endotoxins were continuously oxidized, the endotoxin activity and inflammatory response decreased again but not to the background level. Therefore, the inflammation inducing ability of reclaimed water could not be removed efficiently. These results suggest that in spite of its high oxidability, UV/Cl-2 treatment is not capable of removing the endotoxin-based toxicity, and other technologies are necessary to control endotoxin levels in reclaimed water.

AB The mechanism of removal of humic acid, phosphate and kaolin particles by coagulation with alum and PACT or adsorption by their pre-formed precipitates was investigated, and it was found that the coagulation mechanisms for monomeric Al at neutral pH and polymeric Al-13 at alkaline pH were very similar. The removal of phosphate and humic acid by coagulation with alum or PACT did not change with stirring time (between 1 min and 15 min), independent of the dose and species of coagulants. However, for adsorption of these impurities by pre-formed precipitates, the results were significantly different. Both Al3+ and nano-sized Al-13 could precipitate and form aggregates at pH 7 and pH 9, respectively, and their precipitates became less active (fewer binding sites on the surface of precipitate) with the increase of shear time or shear rates before adsorbing pollutants. Thus, although the total surface area increased (the average size of flocs became smaller) at higher applied shear rates or longer shear time, the removal efficiency of humic acid and phosphate decreased. Also, from the MW distributions, it was confirmed that less humic acid was removed by the adsorption on alum precipitate pre-formed with longer shear time. Chemical groups (OH(2)and OH) on the surface of precipitate determined the removal efficiency of phosphate and humic acid, and the activity of precipitate become lower as a result of higher applied shear and longer shear time. This is confirmed be due to some crystallization of the amorphous precipitate, forming inactivated hydroxyl. When kaolin was added 10 min after the alum or PACT precipitate formed, the precipitates captured kaolin particles only on their surface, whereas when alum was added to kaolin suspensions particles were trapped within the growing flocs. When alum/kaolin flocs were broken at high shear rate re-growth of flocs decreased with increasing shear time, but after a short breakage period, long aging of broken flocs had little effect on floc regrowth.

AB Cationic polyacrylamide, a flocculation powder widely used in wastewater pretreatment and sludge dewatering, was highly accumulated in waste activated sludge. However, its effect on short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) accumulation from anaerobic fermentation of waste activated sludge has not been investigated. This work therefore aims to deeply unveil how cationic polyacrylamide affects SCFAs production, through both long-term and batch tests using either real waste activated sludge or synthetic wastewaters as fermentation substrates. Experimental results showed that the presence of cationic polyacrylamide not only significantly decreased the accumulation of SCFAs but also affected the composition of individual SCFA. The concentration of SCFAs decreased from 3374.7 to 2391.7 mg COD/L with cationic polyacrylamide level increasing from 0 to 12 g/kg of total suspended solids, whereas the corresponding percentage of acetic acid increased from 45.2% to 55.5%. The mechanism studies revealed that although cationic polyacrylamide could be partially degraded to produce SCFAs during anaerobic fermentation, cationic polyacrylamide and its major degradation metabolite, polyacrylic acid, inhibited all the sludge solubilization, hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis and homoacetogenesis processes to some extents. As a result, the accumulation of SCFAs in the cationic polyacrylamide added systems decreased rather than increased. However, the inhibition to acetogenesis and homoacetogenesis was slighter than that to acidogenesis, leading to an increase of acetic acid to total SCFAs. It was further found that cationic polyacrylamide had stronger ability to adhere to protein molecules surface, which inhibited the bioconversion of proteins more severely. Illumina MiSeq sequencing analyses showed that cationic polyacrylamide decreased microbial community diversity, altered community structure and changed activities of key enzymes responsible for SCFAs accumulation.

AB Scaling in membrane distillation (MD) is a key issue in desalination of concentrated saline water, where the interface property between the membrane and the feed become critical. In this paper, a slippery mechanism was explored as an innovative concept to understand the scaling behavior in membrane distillation for a soluble salt, NaCl. The investigation was based on a novel design of a superhydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane with micro-pillar arrays (MP-PVDF) using a micromolding phase separation (mu PS) method. The membrane showed a contact angle of 166.0 +/- 23 degrees and the sliding angle of 15.8 +/- 3.3 degrees. After CF4 plasma treatment, the resultant membrane (CF4-MP-PVDF) showed a reduced sliding angle of 3.0 degrees. In direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD), the CF4-MP-PVDF membrane illustrated excellent anti-scaling in concentrating saturated NaCl feed. Characterization of the used membranes showed that aggregation of NaCl crystals occurred on the control PVDF and MP-PVDF membranes, but not on the CF4-MP-PVDF membrane. To understand this phenomenon, a "slippery" theory was introduced and correlated the sliding angle to the slippery surface of CF4-MP-PVDF and its anti-scaling property. This work proposed a well-defined physical and theoretical platform for investigating scaling problems in membrane distillation and beyond. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A techno-economic analysis is used to evaluate the economic feasibility of ion concentration polarization (ICP) desalination for seawater desalination and brine management. An empirical optimization model based on a limited set of experimental data, which was obtained from a lab-scale ICP desalination prototype, was established to calculate the required energy and membrane area for a given set of operating parameters. By calculating operating and capital expenses in various feed and product cases, the optimal levelized cost of water is determined over a range of feed salinities, mostly above seawater salinity (35 g/kg). Through these analyses, we study the economic feasibility of three applications: 1) partial desalination of brine discharge by ICP (feed varied from 35 to 75 g/kg) to common seawater RO feed level (35 g/kg) in a hybrid ICP-RO system; 2) the concentration of seawater desalination brine for salt production, and 3) partial desalination of oilfield wastewater. The economic feasibility of ICP desalination processes has been evaluated and the rough cost of treatment has been generated for several relevant applications. The approach taken in this work could be employed for other new and existing desalination processes, where a priori process modeling and optimization is scientifically and/or numerically challenging.

AB Municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs) are an important point source of microplastics in domestic waterways. In the present study, effluents from the largest water reclamation plant in China were sampled throughout the treatment process and microplastics were extracted and identified to evaluate their removal. As expected, microplastics were detected in the influent (12.03 +/- 1.29 items/L). Following treatment, concentrations of microplastics were reduced by greater than 95% and 0.59 +/- 0.22 items/L of microplastics were detected in reclaimed waters. Among detected microplastics, 18 types of polymers of ten colors were identified. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS) and polypropylene (PP) accounted for greater than 70% of detected microplastics. Furthermore, microfibers were the dominant shape detected with an average size of 1110.72 +/- 862.95 mu m. However, microparticles accounted for only 14.08% of total microplastics with an average size of 681.46 +/- 528.73 mu m. Results of the present study suggest that current treatment technologies employed at the chosen STP are efficient to remove the majority of microplastics, however consideration of STPs as a point source of microplastics is important due to the large volumes of effluents being released into the aquatic environment on a consistent basis.

AB Disinfection of drinking water using chlorine can lead to the formation of genotoxic by-products when chlorine reacts with natural organic matter (NOM). A vast number of such disinfection by-products (DBPs) have been identified, making it almost impossible to routinely monitor all DBPs with chemical analysis. In this study, a bioanalytical approach was used, measuring oxidative stress (Nrf2 activity), genotoxicity (micronucleus test), and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation to evaluate an innovative water treatment process, including suspended ion exchange, ozonation, in-line coagulation, ceramic microfiltration, and granular activated carbon. Chlorination was performed in laboratory scale after each step in the treatment process in order to investigate the effect of each treatment process to the formation of DBPs. Suspended ion exchange had a high capacity to remove dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and to decrease UV absorbance and Nrf2 activity in non-chlorinated water. High-dose chlorination (10 mg Cl-2 L-1) of raw water caused a drastic induction of Nrf2 activity, which was decreased by 70% in water chlorinated after suspended ion exchange. Further reduction of Nrf2 activity following chlorination was achieved by ozonation and the concomitant treatment steps. The ozonation treatment resulted in decreased Nrf2 activity in spite of unchanged DOC levels. However, a strong correlation was found between UV absorbing compounds and Nrf2 activity, demonstrating that Nrf2 inducing DBPs were formed from pre-cursors of a specific NOM fraction, constituted of mainly aromatic compounds. Moreover, high dose chlorination of raw water induced genotoxicity. In similarity to the DOC levels, UV absorbance and Nrf2 activity, the disinfection-induced genotoxicity was also reduced by each treatment step of the innovative water treatment technique. AhR activity was observed in the water produced by the conventional process and in the raw water, but the activity was clearly decreased by the ozonation step in the innovative water treatment process.

AB Although sludge-converted short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are promising feedstocks for biorefineries, it remains challenging to maximise SCFA production by enhancing synergies between chemical/biological hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes while employing a balanced composition of microbial communities to counteract methanogenesis. Herein, stepwise control of fermentation pH and chemical/microbiological composition analysis of fermented sludge were used to probe the underlying mechanisms of SCFA production. Fermentation at pH 11 during the first three days promoted both chemical and microbial hydrolysis of sludge proteins and provided a niche for Anaerobrancaceae sp. to transform soluble protein into SCFAs. When pH was decreased from 11 to 9, Acinetobacter, Proteiniborus, Proteiniclasticum, and other acetogens became predominant and stayed significantly more active than during first-stage fermentation at pH 11, which benefited the acidification of hydrolysed substrates. Further assays indicated that early-stage sludge fermentation at pH 11 decreased the total amount of methanogenic archaea and hence reduced the amount of SCFAs consumed for methane production. Thus, the use of stepwise pH control for sludge fermentation allowed one to establish process synergies, facilitate chemical and biological hydrolysis, inhibit methanogens, and promote the growth of acidifying bacterial communities, which resulted in efficient SCFA production from sludge.

AB The stability and transport of clay colloids in groundwater are strongly influenced by colloid interactions with dissolved organic matter (DOM). Protein is an important DOM component that is ubiquitous in natural water, reclaimed water, and soil solutions. To date, the interactions between clay colloids and proteins have not been fully studied. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of bovine serum albumin (BSA), a representative protein, on the stability, aggregation, and transport of kaolinite colloids under neutral pH conditions. Hydrodynamic diameter and zeta-potential measurements, stability tests, and column transport experiments were performed in salt solutions with a range of ionic strengths and different BSA concentrations at pH 7. Additionally, BSA-kaolinite colloid interactions were studied using TEM and batch adsorption experiments. The experimental results showed that BSA prevented colloid aggregation and increased the stability and transport of colloids, especially at high ionic strength, even though the charges of kaolinite colloids were less negative in the presence of BSA. Theoretical calculation of the interaction energies indicated that XDLVO theory, in which the steric force is considered due to BSA adsorption, could correctly quantify the interaction energies in the presence of BSA. This study demonstrated that the role of protein needs to be determined in order to better predict the overall effect of DOM on particle aggregation and transport in the soil environment.

AB The effect of bioaugmentation with different microorganisms on anaerobic digestion to mitigate the ammonia inhibition problem was investigated. Seven pure strains of microorganisms (including obligate aceticlastic methanogen, facultative aceticlastic methanogen, hydrogenotrophic methanogen, syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria (SAOB) were selected and thirteen bioaugmentation approaches were tested. Bioaugmentation with hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanobrevibacter smithii (MBS) and SAOB Syntrophaceticu schinkii together was the optimal choice, methane production (MP) was 71.1% higher than that in Blank, the activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was greatly heightened according to specific methanogenic activity analysis. Bioaugmentation with facultative aceticlastic methanogen Methanosarcina barkeri (MSB) alone without SAOB addition was also proven efficient (MP was 59.7% higher than that in Blank), both aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis were enhanced. Further evaluation with carbon isotope fractionations analysis indicated that balancing the activities of the aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathways is of great importance. 16s rRNA gene sequencing results showed that Methanobacterium spp. and Methanosaeta spp. were the dominant archaea in all 14 reactors. Nevertheless, bioaugmentation with Methanosaeta spp. did not result in a positive effect on MP. On the other hand, Methanobrevibacter spp. and Methanosarcina spp. were non-dominant archaea (even after bioaugmentation with MBS or MSB, the relative abundances were still poor (<2%)), but displayed pivotal roles in determining the overall microbial consortium and, in turn, improved the overall performance.

AB Hazardous waste dewatering is important for volume reduction and further treatment. Hazardous organic wastes with low ratio of free to bound water, and low flash point are difficult to dewater and pose an explosion risk for conventional thermal drying. Here, we develop a facile one-pot, alkali-assisted hydrothermal treatment (AHT) method for cost-efficient hazardous waste dewatering, dry mass minimization and volume reduction. Wet paint sludge (WPS), a hazardous organic waste, was reduced (79% by total weight and 52% by dry mass) by dewatering through AHT hydrophobic modification, and the product was nonflammable. Conversion of bound water to free water enhanced WPS dissolution for further decomposition. Alkali was critical for boosting ether demethylation in the solid phase, and cleavage of ethers forming alcohols that facilitated transfer of solid mass into the liquid phase. Polar functional groups were eliminated through AHT, which increased the relative abundance of hydrophobic functional groups on the surface of solid residues and promoted dewatering. We also demonstrate that AHT can be widely adapted and scaled up to treat various hazardous organic waste streams, which is of significant industrial and environmental interest.

AB Recent studies have shown that crAssphage is abundant in human faecal samples worldwide. It has thus been postulated as a potential microbial source tracking (MST) marker to detect human faecal pollution in water. However, an effective implementation of crAssphage in water management strategies will depend on an understanding of its environmental dynamics. In this work, the abundance and temporal distribution of crAssphage was analysed in the effluent of wastewater treatment plants using different sewage treatments, and in two rivers (water and sediments) that differ in pollution impact and flow regime. Additionally, the influence of environmental conditions (temperature and rainfall) on the removal of the marker was studied along a river section, and natural inactivation was assessed by a mesocosms approach. Molecular and culture-based tools were used to compare crAssphage abundance and dynamics with those of bacteria and bacteriophages currently applied as global indicators (E. coli, somatic coliphages, Bacteroides GA17 bacteriophages, and the human-associated MST markers HF183 and HMBif). CrAssphage concentrations in sewage effluent and river samples were similar to those of HF183 and HMBif and higher than other general and/or culture-based indicators (by 2-3 orders of magnitude). Measurement of crAssphage abundance revealed no temporal variability in the effluent, although rainfall events affected the dynamics, possibly through the mobilisation of sediments, where the marker was detected in high concentrations, and an increase in diffuse and point pollution. Another factor affecting crAssphage inactivation was temperature. Its persistence was longer compared with other bacterial markers analysed by qPCR but lower than culturable markers. The results of this study support the use of crAssphage as a human source tracking marker of faecal pollution in water, since it has similar abundances to other molecular human MST markers, yet with a longer persistence in the environment. Nevertheless, its use in combination with infectious bacteriophages is probably advisable. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A moderate Mn(VII) oxidation-in situ Fe(III) coagulation (Mn(VII)-Fe(II)) conditioning strategy was proposed to improve sludge filterability and release the water bound in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). During Mn(VII)-Fe(II) conditioning, flocs disintegration and cell disruption, macro and micro physicochemical properties of activated sludge, especially of EPS, were investigated. Relationships between protein molecular structures in EPS fractions of three layers and sludge dewaterability were also determined. Besides, factor analysis was used to explain the variances of "functional" protein secondary structures, which may have an important effect on sludge dewaterability. Results showed that sludge filterability (CST0/CST) increased by 2.40 times and partial bound water was released at 2 min oxidation of 120 mg/g KMnO4 with subsequent FeCl2 termination at equivalent molar ratio of 1:3. During this strategy, EPS wrapping on cells surface was disintegrated, and a limited influence occurred on cells. It was also found that CST and bound water content were strongly correlated with aggregated strands, random coil and beta-turn percentages in slime (R-2 > -0.82, p < 0.05). Moreover, the dewaterability also presented strong negative correlations with aggregated strands, beta-sheet and beta-turn in TB-EPS (R-2 > -0.78, p < 0.05). This suggested that unfolding and despiralization of slime protein and moderate weakening rigidity of tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS) protein were beneficial for improvement of sludge dewaterability. In addition, the strong correlation between percentages of "functional" protein secondary structures and factor 1 score (R-2 > 0.85, p < 0.05) demonstrated that EPS migration, rather than only EPS disintegration, may have a key impact on the formation of some protein secondary structures in slime and TB-EPS. The observed protein secondary structures, which may affect sludge dewaterability, were probably derived from inner EPS. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Studying the abundance, characteristics, and removal of microplastics (MPs) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in coastal cities is of great significance for understanding the impacts of human activities on the marine environment, but currently, little information on this topic is available in China. Therefore, the abundance, characteristics, and removal of MPs in seven WWTPs of Xiamen, a typical coastal city in China, are studied. Sixty samples were collected using an improved sampling method involving an electromagnetic flowmeter and a fast digital camera. The influent MN concentration is 1.57-13.69 items/L, and it is reduced to 0.20-1.73 items/L in the effluent, indicating that 79.3-97.8% MPs is removed. Based on the daily effluent discharge and MPs removal rate, it is estimated that similar to 6.5 x 10(8) MPs are released from the seven WWTPs into the Xiamen Bay each day. The light microscopic and micro-Raman spectroscopic analysis indicates that similar to 62.68% of particles are plastic polymers, including polypropylene (31.6%), polyethylene (21.9%), polystyrene (10.1%), propylene/ethylene copolymer (9.2%), and polyethylene terephthalate (7.5%). The color of MPs is mainly composed of white (27.3%) and clears (25.8%). Our results show that granules (41.1%) are the dominant shape of MPs, followed by fragments (31.3%), fibers (23.7%), and pellet (3.9%). The characteristics of MPs such as sizes, shapes, and types affect the MPs removal in WWTPs. Our findings show that MPs concentration in the influent is positively correlated with the suspended solids (SS), however, in the effluent, it is associated with the WWTPs operating load, as reflected by obviously higher MP abundance in overloaded ones.

AB The physical states of water are crucial for the dewatering efficiency of waste-activated sludge (WAS). However, to date, there is still lack of promising methods for the distinct differentiation of water states in colloidal microbial aggregates. This study proposed that the transverse spin-spin relaxation time (T-2) distribution of low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) could be a useful tool to unravel the occurrence state of water in WAS. Due to the different interaction strengths of protons with the surrounding environment, the three water states with different T-2 ranges were identified. The water strongly trapped on the surface of solid phase through hydrogen bound could be classified as vicinal water; interstitial water refers to the water physically trapped in bio-floc by steric hindrance or adsorption; and the water that is least affected by solid compositions is categorized as moderately mobile water. The potential ways of typical conditioning approaches for shifting water states were also investigated. The removal of hydrophilic compounds in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and surface charge neutralization were both found to be possible ways to influence the percentage of vicinal water (Pearson correlation coefficient R-p > 0.950, p-value <= 0.05). The disintegration or compaction of colloidal microbial aggregates could induce the transformation of interstitial water into moderately mobile water. All the above results are believed to deepen the mechanism insights into the differentiation and interactive transformation of water states in bio-floc of WAS. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Denitrification is the stepwise microbial reduction of nitrate or nitrite (NO2-) to nitrogen gas via the obligate intermediates nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Substantial N2O accumulation has been reported in denitrifying enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) bioreactors enriched in denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms (DPAOs), but little is known about underlying mechanisms for N2O generation, prevalence of complete versus truncated denitrification pathways, or the impact of NO2- feed on DPAO-enriched consortia. To address this knowledge gap, we employed genome-resolved metagenomics to investigate nitrogen transformation potential in a NO2- fed denitrifying EBPR bioreactor enriched in Candidatus Accumulibacter and prone to N2O accumulation. Our analysis yielded 41 near-complete metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including two co-occurring Accumulibacter strains affiliated with clades IA and IC (the first published genome from this Glade) and 39 non-PAO flanking bacterial genomes. The dominant Accumulibacter Glade IA encoded genes for complete denitrification, while the lower abundance Accumulibacter Glade IC harbored all denitrification genes except for a canonical respiratory NO reductase. Analysis of the 39 non-PAO MAGs revealed a high prevalence of taxa harboring an incomplete denitrification pathway. Of the 27 MAGs harboring capacity for at least one step in the denitrification pathway, 10 were putative N2O producers lacking N2O reductase, 16 were putative N2O reducers that lacked at least one upstream denitrification gene, and only one harbored a complete denitrification pathway. We also documented increasing abundance over the course of reactor operation of putative N2O producers. Our results suggest that the unusually high levels of N2O production observed in this Accumulibacter-enriched consortium are linked in part to the selection for non-PAO flanking microorganisms with truncated denitrification pathways.

AB The stable operation of the partial nitritation and anammox (PN/A) process is a challenge in the treatment of low-strength ammonia wastewater like sewage mainstream. This study demonstrated the feasibility of achieving stable operation in the treatment of 50 mg/L ammonia wastewater with a micro granule-based PN/A reactor. The long-term operation results showed nitrogen removal efficiencies of 71.8 +/- 9.9% were stably obtained under a relatively short hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2 h. The analysis on the physicochemical properties of the granules indicated most of the granules were in a size in a range of 265-536 mu m, and the elementary composition of the granules was determined to be CH1.61O0.61N0.17S0.01P0.03. The microbial analysis revealed Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis anammox bacteria and Nitrosomonas-like AOB were the two most dominant bacteria with 27.6% and 10.5% abundance, respectively, both of which formed spatially syntrophic co-immobilization within the micro granules. The ex-situ activity tests showed the activity of NOB was well limited through DO regulation in the reactor. These results provide an alternative PN/A process configuration for low-strength wastewater treatment by sustaining microstate granules. Optimization of the nitrogen sludge loading rate and DO regulation are important for the successful performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Algal-derived dissolved organic matter (ADOM) originating from lysed Microcystis aeruginosa cells was investigated as precursor material to form disinfection by-products upon disinfection with free chlorine. Non-targeted ultrahigh resolution 12 T negative mode electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) revealed high molecular diversity in solid-phase extracted and ionizable components of Microcystis aeruginosa ADOM. The toxin microcystin LR was effectively degraded by free chlorine, which was expected. However, we found a high diversity of disinfection by-products associated with the addition of free chlorine to the water-soluble and solid-phase extractable fraction of ADOM and of double-bond moieties in abundant and known unsaturated fatty acids. Aromatic DOM precursors were absent from known metabolites of Microcystis aeruginosa and no evidence for aromatic disinfection by-products (DBPs) was found, despite N-containing compounds. A large diversification of N-containing molecular formulas was observed after chlorination, which seems indicative for the breakdown and oxidation of larger peptides. Additionally, a diverse group of N-compounds with presumed chloramine functional groups was observed. This study highlights the importance to evaluate ADOM and its ability to form different DBPs when compared to allochthonous or terrestrially-derived DOM. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

AB The sludge in situ reduction process by inserting an anaerobic side-stream reactor (ASSR) in a sludge return line provides a cost-effective approach to reduce sludge production in activated sludge systems. In this study, four pilot-scale membrane bioreactors (MBRs), including an AO-MBR for control, ASSR coupled MBR (ASSR-MBR), a MBR with ASSR packed with carriers (AP-MBR) and an AP-MBR with part of sludge ultrasonicated before fed into ASSR (AUP-MBR) were operated in parallel to investigate enhancing effects of ultrasonication and packing carriers on sludge reduction and pollutants removal performance under both normal and low temperature. Low temperature showed negligible impact on COD removal, deteriorated NH4+-N and TN removal from 98.3% to 69.7% at 21.6 degrees C to 92.5% and 48.8% at 2.6 degrees C, and decreased sludge reduction efficiency (SRE) in ASSR-MBR Packing carriers and ultrasonication both enhanced sludge reduction, especially under low temperature with SRE values increased from 8.2% of ASSR-MBR to 17.1% of AP-MBR and 32.6% of AUP-MBR at 4.5 +/- 2.5 degrees C. Packing carriers and ultrasonication increased cell rupture by 11.1% and 14.5% in aerobic MBR, enhanced protease activity in ASSR by 60.0% and 116.3%, and reduced ATP content for heterotrophic metabolism by 31.4% and 7.3%, respectively. MiSeq sequencing results showed that packing carriers enriched hydrolytic bacteria (Terrimonas, Dechloromonas and Woodsholea), slow growers (Sulfuritalea, Thauera and Azospira) and predatory bacteria (Bdellovibrio and norank_Saprospiraceae), while ultrasonication further enriched hydrolytic bacteria (norank_Saccharibacteria and Ferruginibacter). Packing carriers is more cost-effective than ultrasonication to enhance sludge reduction by partial damage to bacterial cells and promoting better interaction between bacteria, enzymes and substrates to favor particles hydrolysis.

AB Total dissolved gas supersaturation (TDGS) downstream caused by spill discharge from high dams can easily cause fish to suffer from gas bubble disease (GBD). One potential approach to mitigate the impact of TDGS is at the confluence of a downstream tributary, where the introduction of low-TDG water might provide refuge space for fish. In this study, we carried out a series of flume experimental cases and established a three-dimensional TDGS model at confluences. The formula of the dissipation coefficient of TDGS had been obtained by parts of experiment cases. The other parts of experimental cases were carried out to validate the established TDGS model. The biggest relative error of TDG concentration between the experiment and simulation was -5.7%. The results show that the convergence of tributary water (TDG = 100%) can affect the mainstream water (TDG = 140% similar to 150%) significantly. The two most obvious features are the presence of the separation zone and secondary flow which become more significant as the flow rate increases. The separation zone area at the bottom is smaller than that at the surface. There are two secondary circulations on transversal planes which decrease as the longitudinal distance increases. In addition, the area below 110% and 120% of TDGS in different planes of different cases were compared in detail. This study can provide scientific basis for the utilization of the low-TDG-saturation region to protect fish from the damage of TDGS at confluences during high dam discharge. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Water is a resource that affects every aspect of life. Intentional (terrorist or wartime events) or accidental water contamination events could have a tremendous impact on public health, behavior and morale. Quick detection of such events can mitigate their effects and reduce the potential damage. Continuous on-line monitoring is the first line of defense for reducing contamination associated damage. One of the available tools for such detection is the UV-absorbance spectrophotometry, where the absorbance spectra are compared against a set of normal and contaminated water fingerprints. However, as there are many factors at play that affect this comparison, it is an elusive and tedious task. Further, the comparison against a set of known fingerprints is futile when the water in the supply system are a mix, with varying proportions, of water from different sources, which differ significantly in their physicochemical characteristics. This study presents a new scheme for early detection of contamination events through UV absorbance under unknown routine conditions. The detection mechanism is based on a new affinity measure, Fitness, and a procedure similar to Gram based amplification, which result in a flexible mechanism to alert if a contamination is present. The method was shown to be most effective when applied to a set of comprehensive experiments, which examined the absorbance of various contaminants in drinking water in lab and real-life configurations. Four datasets, which contained real readings from either laboratory experiments or monitoring station of an operational water supply system were used. To extend the testbed even further, an artificial dataset, simulating a vast array of proportions between specific water sources is also presented. The results show, that for all datasets, high detection rates, while maintaining low levels of false alarms, were obtained by the algorithm. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sialic acids have been discovered in the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of seawater-adapted aerobic granular sludge (AGS). Sialic acids are a group of monosaccharides with a nine-carbon backbone, commonly found in mammalian cells and pathogenic bacteria, and frequently described to protect EPS molecules and cells from attack by proteases or glycosidases. In order to further understand the role of these compounds in AGS, lectin staining, genome analysis of the dominant bacterial species, and shielding tests were done. Fluorescence lectin bar-coding (FLBC) analysis showed an overlap with protein staining, indicating presence of sialoglycoproteins in the EPS matrix. Genome analysis gives a positive indication for putative production of sialic acids by the dominant bacteria Candidates Accumulibacter. FTIR analysis shows upon selective removal of sialic acids a decrease in carbohydrates, extension of the protein side chain, and exposure of penultimate sugars. Enzymatic removal of sialic acids results in the removal of galactose residues from the EPS upon subsequent treatment with beta-galactosidase, indicating a linkage between galactose and sialic acid at the terminus of glycan chains. This work indicates the importance of sialic acids in the protection of penultimate sugar residues of glycoproteins in EPS, and provides basis for future research in the composition of EPS from biofilms and granular sludge.

AB Dunaliella salina is a green microalgae species industrially exploited for its capacity to produce important amounts of carotenoid pigments. However in low nitrogen conditions in which they produce these pigments, their concentration is low, which results in harvesting difficulties and high costs. In this work, we propose a new solution to efficiently harvest D. saline at the pre-industrial scale, using flocculation/flotation harvesting induced by NaOH addition in the medium. We first show, using numerical simulations and nanoscale atomic force spectroscopy experiments, that sweeping mechanism in formed magnesium hydroxide precipitate is only responsible for D. salina flocculation in hypersaline culture medium upon NaOH addition. Based on this understanding of the flocculation mechanism, we then evaluate the influence of several parameters related to NaOH mixing and magnesium hydroxide precipitation and show that NaOH concentration, mixing, and salinity of the medium can be optimized to achieve high flocculation/flotation harvesting efficiencies in laboratory-scale experiments. We finally successfully scale-up the data obtained at lab-scale to a continuous pre-industrial flotation pilot, and achieve up to 80% of cell recovery. This interdisciplinary study thus provides original results, from the nano to the pre-industrial scale, which allow the successful development of an efficient large-scale D. salina harvesting process. We thus anticipate our results to be the starting point for further optimization and industrial use of this flocculation/flotation harvesting technique. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tetrafluoroborate anion (BF4-) is found in the streams of flue-gas desulfurization and borosilicate glasses etching which deteriorates water quality through slow hydrolysis into boric acid and fluoride. Decomposition and electrocoagulation (EC) of BF4- were studied using metallic aluminum as the sacrificial electrode. The dissolved Al(III) from the anode could efficiently decompose BF4- in forms of fluoroaluminate complexes, and the derived boric acid and fluoride ion were removed by sweep flocculation. Major variables were investigated to optimize EC, including the reaction pH, initial concentration of BF4- current density and electrolyte type. The mechanism of EC process was elucidated with the kinetics of consecutive reactions. Experimental results suggested that the removal of BF4- and total fluoride were less influenced by pH, and that of total boron reached a maximum at pH 8 which favored the surface complexation between borate species and EC precipitates. Under the conditions: [BF4-](0) = 9.3 mM, [NaCl] = 10 mM, pH = 8.0, current density = 5 mA/cm(2), 98.3% of BET was decomposed and the removal of total fluoride and boron attained 98.2% and 74.1%, respectively within 3 h. EC using the Al electrode outperformed the conventional chemical coagulation and reduced the levels of BF4-, B(OH)(3) and F- in aqueous solution synergically. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A pilot microbial electrochemical system (MES) system with a total volume of 1.5 m(3) was developed and operated outdoor in a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Microbial separator based on the dynamic biofilm on low-cost porous matrix was applied to replace ion exchange membranes (1EMs), while the separate plug-in module architecture allowed the totally 336 pairs of MES units and 14 separator modules to be integrated into one wastewater tank. The separator layer equally divided the wastewater tank into 7 cathodic and 8 anodic compartments. Fed with primary sedimentation tank effluent of WWTP, the pilot MES achieved stable removal efficiency for chemical oxygen demand (91 +/- 3%), total nitrogen (64 +/- 2%) and ammonium nitrogen (91 +/- 3%), which were complied with the first grade A standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant (DSPMWTP) in China. The stable power output of pilot MES was 406 +/- 30 mW M-3 based on effective liquid volume, or energy conversion performance of 2.03 x 10(-3) kWh m(-3) (one cubic meter of influent wastewater). The pilot MES achieved much lower effluent COD of 25 +/- 7 mg L-1 with HRT of 5 h, while that of activated sludge process in WWTP was 43 +/- 6 mg L-1 under HRT of 12 h. Even though the aeration of biocathode demanded a net electricity consumption of 3.44 x 10(-3) kWh M-3, the low operation energy requirement for pilot MES was only 12% of that in a typical activated sludge process (0.3 kWh m(-3)). By avoiding the utilization of IEMs and redundant structural materials, the pilot MES achieved a low system cost of $1702.1 (or $1135 m(-3)) as well and promoted the further real-world application of MES.

AB Instrumentation, control and automation (ICA) are currently applied throughout the urban water system at water treatment plants, in water distribution networks, in sewer networks, and at wastewater treatment plants. However, researchers and practitioners specialising in respective urban water subsystems do not frequently interact, and in most cases to date the application of ICA has been achieved in silo. Here, we review start-of-the-art ICA throughout these sub-systems, and discuss the benefits achieved in terms of performance improvement, cost reduction, and more importantly, the enhanced capacity of the existing infrastructure to cope with increased service demand caused by population growth and continued urbanisation. We emphasise the importance of integrated control within each of the sub-systems, and also across the entire urban water system. System-wide ICA will have increasing importance with the growing complexity of the urban water environment in cities of the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biofiltration has been shown to be effective for disinfection by-product (DBP) precursor control, however few studies have considered its role in the potential formation of DBPs. Biofilm is composed of heterogeneous bacteria as well as extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The objective of this study was to determine the contribution of biofilm-related materials such as EPS to form nitrogen-containing DBPs upon chloramination, and to determine the influence of cyclical (scheduled on-off) biofilter operation on DBP precursor removal. Biologically active media was sampled from a full-scale biofilter operating under cold-water conditions (3.6 +/- 0.5 degrees C) and extracted using a cation exchange resin into a phosphate buffer solution. Biomass concentrations, as determined using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) measurements, remained stable at 298 +/- 55 ng ATP/g media over the trial period. N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and haloacetonitrile (HAN(4)) formation potential (FP) tests conducted under uniform formation conditions (UFC) using extracted biofilm yielded 0.80 +/- 0.27 ng NDMA/g media and 18.7 +/- 3.3 ng dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN)/g media. Further analyses of extracted biofilm using fluorescence spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection indicated the presence of proteins above 20 kDa and humiclike substances. Extracted proteins (93.5 +/- 8.1 mu g/g media) correlated well (R = 0.90) with UV 280 measurements, indicating that spectrophotometry may serve as a valuable tool to quantify proteins in extracted biofilms. While substances in biofilms can serve as NDMA and DCAN precursors, the full-scale cyclically-operated biofilter that was examined did not show release of NDMA precursors during start-up following stagnation periods of 6 h or more. These biofilters consistently removed 6.9 +/- 4.3 ng/L of NDMA precursors; typical NDMA UFC-FP of biofilter effluent was 8.5 +/- 2.6 ng/L. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microplastics have recently been detected in drinking water as well as in drinking water sources. This presence has triggered discussions on possible implications for human health. However, there have been questions regarding the quality of these occurrence studies since there are no standard sampling, extraction and identification methods for microplastics. Accordingly, we assessed the quality of fifty studies researching microplastics in drinking water and in its major freshwater sources. This includes an assessment of microplastic occurrence data from river and lake water, groundwater, tap water and bottled drinking water. Studies of occurrence in wastewater were also reviewed. We review and propose best practices to sample, extract and detect microplastics and provide a quantitative quality assessment of studies reporting microplastic concentrations. Further, we summarize the findings related to micro plastic concentrations, polymer types and particle shapes. Microplastics are frequently present in freshwaters and drinking water, and number concentrations spanned ten orders of magnitude (1 x 10(-2) to 10(8) #/m(3)) across individual samples and water types. However, only four out of 50 studies received positive scores for all proposed quality criteria, implying there is a significant need to improve quality assurance of microplastic sampling and analysis in water samples. The order in globally detected polymers in these studies is PE approximate to PP > PS > PVC > PET, which probably reflects the global plastic demand and a higher tendency for PVC and PET to settle as a result of their higher densities. Fragments, fibres, film, foam and pellets were the most frequently reported shapes. We conclude that more high quality data is needed on the occurrence of microplastics in drinking water, to better understand potential exposure and to inform human health risk assessments.

AB The increased use of synthetic textiles in the last decades, coupled with recent emphasis on the accumulation of (micro)plastic across multiple environmental compartments, has garnered interest into how microplastic fibers are released into the environment. In particular, polyester textiles washed in the home have shown to release microplastic fibers but challenges with microplastic fiber analysis, including time and difficulty of sample preparation and measurement, has limited mechanistic studies on fiber fate and transport studies. In this study, we provide a method to synthesize fibers with an embedded inorganic (In) fingerprint which can be used as a tracer for ease of analysis and show the utility of this approach to assess the affinity for heteroaggregation between microplastic fibers and other particles in a heterogeneous suspension, as well as approximate the fate of microplastic fibers in batch studies using activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Total In content in the fibers was measured to be 0.2 % by weight, which was low enough to not change fiber dynamics for fate and transport studies (e.g. density, etc.) but provided sensitive detection limits by ICP-MS. Fiber length was 510 mu m +/- 410 mu m and 30 mu m in diameter. The incorporated metal remained stable inside the polymer when suspended in water and in activated sludge, with < 0.1 % In leaching over two months. In batch experiments, the majority of fibers were associated with the sludge ( > 99.9 %), with a mass balance of > 95 % recovery achieved on average across batches. Fiber removal linearly increased with contact times of up to 10 min, suggesting interactions between plastics and organic matter is a metric that should be considered closely in this and other environmental contexts for fate and transport.

AB Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a sustainable pathway towards recovering chemical energy from excess sludge, and humic substances (HSs) contained in sludge can inhibit energy (methane/CH4) conversion efficiency. This study aims to investigate the impact of humic acids (HA) on the various processes in a batch anaerobic digestion process. For this purpose, "clean" sludge was cultivated in a laboratory to avoid HSs presence. The cultivated sludge was used in a series of batch experiments, with humic acids added at different levels. A complete AD test, as well as three sub-phase tests (hydrolytic phase; acidogenic phase; methanogenic phase) was performed and analyzed with and without HA dosing. In the single-phase AD system, dosing with HA inhibited the methanogenic efficiency by 35.1% at HA:VSS = 15%. However, the effects of HA on the three sub-phases revealed something very different. HA inhibited hydrolytic efficiency by 38.2%, promoted acidogenic efficiency by 101.5%, and finally inhibited methanogenic efficiency by 52.2%. The combined efficiency of the three sub-phases without HA dosing is calculated at 15.7%; and with HA dosing (HA:VSS = 15%) at 10.2%. Overall, the combined inhibition efficiency of the three sub phases is equal to 35.0%, which is almost identical (35.1%) to the result observed in the single-phase AD process. The possible mechanisms behind the phenomena were analyzed and summarized in the context. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anaerobic digestion of organic matter is the major route of biomethane production. However, in the presence of sulfate, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) typically outcompete methanogens, which may reduce or even preclude methane production from sulfate-containing wastewaters. Although sulfate reduction and methanogenesis can occur simultaneously, our limited understanding of the microbiology of anaerobic digesters treating sulfate-containing wastewaters constrains improvements in the production of methane from these systems. This study tested the effects of carbon sources and chemical oxygen demand-to-sulfate ratio (COD/SO42-) on the diversity and interactions of SRB and methanogens in an anaerobic digester treating a high-sulfate waste stream. Overall, the data showed that sulfate removal and methane generation occurred in varying efficiencies and the carbon source had limited effect on the methane yield. Importantly, the results demonstrated that methanogenic and SRB diversities were only affected by the carbon source and not by the COD/SO42- ratio. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Iron-electrocoagulation is a promising contaminant (e.g. arsenic) removal technology that is based on electrochemical Fe(II) production from steel electrodes and subsequent transport of Fe(II) to the bulk solution, where contaminant removal occurs. Although Fe-electrocoagulation systems have been shown to effectively remove contaminants in extended field trials, the efficiency of field systems can be lower than in laboratory studies. One hypothesis for this disparity is that the Faradaic efficiency of short-term laboratory experiments is higher than field systems operated over extended periods. The Faradaic efficiency is a pivotal performance indicator that we define as the measured Fe dosage normalized by the theoretical Fe dosage calculated by Faraday's law. In this work, we investigated the Faradaic efficiency in laboratory experiments for up to 35 operating cycles (>2 months) with varied Fe(0) anode purity, charge dosage rate, and electrolyte composition. Our results showed that the Faradaic efficiency decreased continuously during repeated operation under typical field conditions (charge dosage rate approximate to 4 C/L/min, synthetic groundwater) regardless of the Fe(0) anode purity, leading to a Faradaic efficiency approximate to 0.6 after 2 months. By contrast, increasing the charge dosage rate to >= 15 C/L/min produced a Faradaic efficiency >0.85 over the entire experiment for both Fe(0) anode purities. Electrolyte solutions free of oxxanions also resulted in sustained Faradaic efficiency >0.85, regardless of the charge dosage rate. Our results confirm a previously proposed relationship between low Faradaic efficiency and the formation of macroscopic electrode surface layers, which consist of Fe (oxyhydr)oxides on the anode and a mixture of Fe (oxyhydr)oxides and calcite on the cathode. Based on these results, we discuss potential strategies to maintain a high Faradaic efficiency during Fe-electrocoagulation field treatment. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The insecticide fipronil is under regulatory scrutiny worldwide for its toxicity to pollinators and aquatic invertebrates. We conducted the first U.S. nationwide, longitudinal study of sewage sludges for fiproles, i.e., the sum of fipronil and its major degradates (fipronil sulfone, sulfide, amide, and desulfinyl). Archived sludges (n = 109) collected in three campaigns over 15 years were analyzed by isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, revealing ubiquitous fiprole occurrence (0.2-385.3 mu g/kg) since 2001 and a significant increase (2.4 +/- 0.3 fold; p <0.005) both from 2001 to 2006/7 and from 2001 to 2015/6, but not a significant increase from 2006/7 to 2015/6 (p = 0.275). A geospatial analysis showed fiprole levels in municipal sludges to be uncoupled from agricultural use of fipronil on cropland surrounding sampled municipalities, thus pointing to non-agricultural uses (i.e., spot-on treatment and urban pest control) as a major source of fiprole loading to wastewater. Whereas anaerobic digestion was correlated with increases in fipronil sulfide at the expense of parental fipronil (p < 0.001), total fiprole levels in sewage sludges were similar regardless of the solids treatment approach applied (p = 0.519). Treatment plant effluent available from 12 facilities in 2015/6 contained fiproles at 0.3-112.9 ng/L, exceeding the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) aquatic invertebrate life benchmark for chronic fipronil exposure (11 ng/L) in 67% of cases. Whereas the USEPA identified fipronil in sludge only recently (2015), retrospective analyses and modeling conducted here show contaminant ubiquity and nationwide increases of fiprole mass (compared to 2001 levels) in U.S. municipal sludge (1140 +/- 230 kg in 2015/6), and treated effluent nationwide (1970 390 kg in 2015/6) over the past 15 years.

AB Control of the organic substrate pool that determines the microbial growth potential (MGP) of feedwater in seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) is a challenge unresolved in conventional or advanced membrane pretreatment. Slow sand filtration (SSF) combines filtration with biodegradation, but its capability of reducing MGP, proteins and carbohydrates on seawater feeds is not known. Two SSF, one constructed with new media (newSSF) and one from a previous filtration run (oldSSF), reduced MGP as measured in a growth assay with the marine organism Pseudoalteromonas songiae by one order of magnitude after maturation periods of 76 and 61 days, respectively. The reduction of the amount of biopolymers deposited on the surfaces of SWRO membranes in laminar fluid flow cells was significant with filtrates from biologically non-acclimated SSF (proteins: -60% (oldSSF) and -66% (new SSF), carbohydrates: 75% (oldSSF) and -70% (newSSF)) and an even greater reduction was observed after filter maturation (proteins: 81% (oldSSF) and -76% (new SSF), carbohydrates: 88% (oldSSF) and -88% (newSSF). Turbidity was less than 0.3 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) and silt density index (SDI) <4 immediately after startup and during the 181 days operating period regardless of the oscillations of the raw sea water quality. Filtration and biological activity were restricted to the top 30 cm of the media column, with no significant further contribution of the deeper media layers to filtrate quality.

AB Objective: As one broader class of non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), non-coding antisense (AS) transcripts are functionally characterized to play pivotal roles in various pathophysiological processes, including tumor biology.
   Methods: In this study, the exact biological functions and regulation mechanisms of GAS6-AS1 in gastric cancer (GC) was examined.
   Results: The expression of GAS6-AS1 was markedly upregulated in GC tissues and is associated with advanced stage (III + IV) of GC patients. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments showed that GAS6-AS1 promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion ability in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in vivo by promoting entry into S-phase. The mechanistic investigations showed that GAS6-AS1 can control the expression of its cognate sense gene GAS6 at the transcriptional or translational levels by forming a RNA-RNA duplex, consequently inducing an increase of AXL level and driveling AXL signaling pathway activation.
   Conclusions: Taken together, our studies indicate that GAS6-AS1 significantly driving the aggressive phenotype in GC through activating its cognate sense gene GAS6, and provides a more complete understanding of GAS6-AS1 as a potential therapeutic target for GC.

AB Human umbilical cord (UC) and cord blood (CB) provide attractive sources of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for cell therapy. Both UCMSCs and CBMSCs have been demonstrated to play prominent roles in clinical therapy. However, little is known about their functional differences in clinical application. Our transcriptome analysis uncovered high activity of insulin secretion related signaling pathways for CBMSCs and cell adhesion related signaling pathways for UCMSCs. Expression of a large number of immune related signaling pathways also showed the difference in both cells, implying their distinct immune modulatory functions. As the therapeutic effects of MSCs mainly dependent on the cytokines and growth factors produced by transplanted MSCs, we further compared the cytokine profiles of UCMSCs and CBMSCs using antibody array. By evaluating the expression of 106 cytokines, we found both MSCs abundantly secreted TSP-1, TSG-14, TIMP-1, IL-8, IL-6, CXCL1, GIF and IGFBP3. However, the expression of CCL2 in UCMSCs showed significantly higher than CBMSCs. IGFBP1 and IGFBP2 were secreted by CBMSCs with higher abundance than UCMSCs. Overall, these results suggest that UCMSCs and CBMSCs preserve different functional potentials, which have to be carefully considered before clinical treatment.

AB Intellectual disabilities (ID) are etiologically heterogeneous. Advanced molecular techniques could be helpful in identification of the underlying genetic defects. We aimed to characterize clinical and molecular features of three Thai patients with ID. Patient 1 had ID, hypotonia and lactic acidosis. Patient 2 had ID and growth failure. Patient 3 had ID, seizure, diarrhea and hypoglycemia. Whole exome sequencing found that Patient 1 was homozygous for a nonsense, c.1303C > T (p.Arg435Ter), mutation in FBXL4, a gene responsible for encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome-13 (MTDPS13). Patient 2 was compound heterozygous for two novel mutations, c.3226C > T (p.Arg1076Ter) and c.3205C > T (p.Arg1069Ter), in UNC80, a known gene of infantile hypotonia with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies-2 (IHPRF2). Patient 3 was homozygous for a novel missense, c.427T > C (p.Cys143Arg), mutation in ADK, a known gene of adenosine kinase deficiency leading to hypermethioninemia. This study expands the mutational spectra of ID genes.

AB The frequency distributions of cystic fibrosis variants are heterogeneous in Ecuador because of the genetic admixture of its population. The aim of this study was to identify disease-causing variants among Ecuadorian cystic fibrosis (CF) patients by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the entire cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (MR) gene. The results showed an approximation of the frequencies of pathogenic variants in the population under study and an optimal mutation panel for routine first-line CF molecular diagnosis. One hundred and forty-one patients with suspected CF from the 3 largest Ecuadorian cities (Guayaquil, Quito, and Cuenca) were studied. One hundred and seventy mutated alleles were detected in eighty-five individuals. Twenty-eight disease-causing variants were identified, with p.Phe508del and p.His609Arg being the most frequent (both 24.7%) followed by p.Gly85Glu (11.1%), p.Leul5Pro (9.4%), p.Asn1303Lys (4.1%), and p.G1y542* (2.3%). Together, these variants constituted 76.44% of the detected disease-causing variants. The following six novel potentially disease-associated variants were detected: 3 deletions (CFTR_dele10, CFTR_dele12, and c.2672delA), 1 nonsense variant (p.Cys491*), 1 missense variant (p.Trp496Arg), and 1 complex allele (p. [Gly253Arg;Gly451Val]). The remaining mutations occurred in isolation and were present in the databases.

AB Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular rare disease characterized by nose and gastrointestinal bleeding, skin and mucosa telangiectasias, and arteriovenous malformations in internal organs. HHT shows an autosomal dominant inheritance and a worldwide prevalence of approximately 1:5000 individuals. In > 80% of patients, HHT is caused by mutations in either ENG (HHT1) or ACVRL1 (HHT2) genes, which code for the membrane proteins Endoglin and Activin A Receptor Type II-Like Kinase 1 (ALK1), respectively, both belonging to the TGF-beta/BMP signaling pathway. In this work, we describe a novel mutation in exon 9 of ENG (c.1145 G > A) found in five affected members of a family, all of them with characteristic symptoms of HHT. This mutation involves Cys382 residue of the Endoglin protein (p.Cys382 > Tyr) in the zona pellucida (ZP) module of its extracellular region. This is a critical residue involved in a conserved intrachain disulphide bond and in the correct folding of the protein. In fact, transfection studies in human cells using Endoglin expression vectors demonstrated that the p.Cys382 > Tyr mutation results in a marked reduction in the levels of the Endoglin protein. These results demonstrate the pathogenic role for this variant in HHT1 and confirm the key function of Cys382 in Endoglin expression.

AB Copy number variation (CNV), as an important component of genomic structural variation (SV), plays essential roles in phenotypic variability, disease susceptibility and species evolution. To investigate whether critical CNVs exist in dairy goats with differing fecundity, we performed genome-wide sequencing of two populations of Laoshan dairy goats with large differences in litter size. After reference genome aligning, CNV calling, and annotation, we screened identified CNVs in the high-fecundity (HF) and low-fecundity (LF) groups to identify discrepant CNVs and their distribution within the genome. Prolactin-related protein 1 and 6 (PRP1 and PRP6), important factors regulating reproductive processes, were demonstrated to be duplicated in the HF group. In summary, based on the differences in CNVs between goats with differing litter sizes, it suggests CNVs may contribute to litter size in Laoshan dairy goats.

AB Objective: This study aimed to investigate the biological role of C5orf34 in Lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) and the mechanism of such role.
   Methods: The mRNA expression of C5orf34 was analyzed using student's t-test based on the data obtained from TCGA database. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to evaluate the prognosis value of C5orf34. Chi-square (chi(2)) test was performed to analyze the correlation between C5orf34 expression and clinical features. The effect of C5orf34 siRNA on A549 and SPCA1 cells proliferation and migration were explored using CCK8 assay, wound healing assay and transwell assays, respectively. Western blot was performed to evaluate the expression of C5orf34, ERK, p-ERK, MEK and p-MEK.
   Results: C5orf34 expression was enhanced in LAD and positively correlated with poor prognosis in patients with LAD. chi(2) test revealed that C5orf34 expression was obviously associated with age (p = 0.016), Pathologic-Stage (p = 0.045) and Pathologic-N (p = 0.023). In addition, knockdown of C5orf34 significantly suppressed A549 and SPCA1 cells proliferation and motility (p < 0.01) in vitro. Moreover, by western blot analysis, we found that depleting C5orf34 remarkably reduced the ratio of p-MEK/MEK and p-ERK/ERK in A549 cells.
   Conclusion: Our results firstly revealed that C5orf34 might play a facilitating role in LAD development and progression by regulating MAPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, our data implied that C5orf34 may be a potential predictor and treatment target for LAD.

AB Intramuscular fat (IMF), which is modulated by the number and size of intramuscular preadipocytes, plays a key role in pork quality. DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups to specific CpG structures in DNA, is involved in the management of diverse intracellular processes. However, the physiological functions of DNMT3A in proliferation and differentiation of porcine intramuscular preadipocytes have not been clearly established. Here, we found that DNMT3A significantly promoted the proliferation, while inhibited the differentiation of intramuscular preadipocytes. We demonstrated that overexpression of DNMT3A promoted the expression of cell proliferation markers but significantly decreased the expression of p21 to repress cell proliferation by the methylation of p21 promoter. Moreover, overexpression of DNMT3A decreased lipid accumulation and significantly down-regulated the levels of adipogenic marker genes including PPARg (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma), SREBP-1c (Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c), and aP2 (FABP4, fatty acid binding protein 4) through the methylation of PPARg promoter. The blocking effect of DNMT3A on adipogenesis can be rescued by rosiglitazone treatment. Collectively, these findings illustrated the essential role of DNMT3A in the proliferation and differentiation of porcine intramuscular preadipocytes, and provide a potential target to improve pork quality.

AB This study focused on mortalin expression and its relevance to the prognosis in serous ovarian carcinoma, mortalin modulated cell malignant proliferation and EMT progression via Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling pathway. In this study, data obtained from Oncomine database, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) analysis and Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was used to assess the expression of mortalin in serous ovarian carcinoma. The prognostic value of mortalin was analyzed using Meier plotter database and Kaplan-Meier. MTT (3-(4,5dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide) assay, immunofluorescence (IF) staining, and colony formation assay were used to detect cell reproductive capacity. SK-OV-3 cell motility and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were measured by wound-healing, migration and western-blot assays. Data from Oncomine showed that mortalin was highly expressed in serous ovarian carcinomas compared with corresponding normal controls. Similar results were found in CCLE analysis and in clinical specimens. High mortalin expression was associated with high histological grade and worse overall survival (OS) rate. The results of MTT analyses, IF staining, and colony formation assay indicated that MKT-077 (1-Ethyl-24(3-ethyl-5-(3-methyl-2(3H)-benzothiazolylidene)-4-oxo-2-thiazolidinylidene] methyl]-pyridinium chloride) suppressed the viability of SK-OV-3 cells. Besides, mortalin suppression restrained cell EMT progression by Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling pathway. Taken together, mortalin is over-expressed in serous ovarian carcinoma. High mortalin expression could be a candidate for the prognostic indicator and a biomarker in serous ovarian carcinoma.

AB Due to the several limitations that surgeons are faced during bone tissue implantation there are daily increases in introducing new cell-co-polymer composites for use in bone tissue engineering approaches. In this study tried to develop a suitable nanostructured bio-composite for enhancing osteogenic differentiation of the human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Polyvinylidene fluoride-Graphene oxide (PVDF-GO) nanofibers was fabricated by electrospinning and then characterized using scanning electron microscope, tensile and viability assays. After that osteogenic differentiation of the iPSCs was investigated in three groups, including PVDF, PVDF-GO and tissue culture plate as a control group. Alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium content of the iPSCs cultured on PVDF-GO were significantly higher than those cultured on other groups. In addition, Runx2, osteocalcin and osteonectin genes were up regulated in iPSCs cultured on PVDF-GO significantly higher than those cells cultured on PVDF and control. Finally, osteocalcin and osteopontin proteins expression evaluated and the results confirmed higher osteoinductivity of the PVDF-GO nanofibers in comparison with the PVDF nanofibers. According to the results, it was demonstrated that PVDF-GO nanofibers have a great osteoinductive potential and taking together iPSCs-PVDF-GO nanofibrous construct can be an appropriate bio-implant to use for bone tissue engineering applications.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an essential role in cancer development. Several studies have indicated that miRNAs mediate tumorigenesis processes, such as inflammation, proliferation, apoptosis and invasion. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of the microRNA-185 (miR-185) on the proliferation, migration and invasion of osteosarcoma (OS). MiR-185 expression was reduced in OS tissues and OS cell lines. MiR-185 inhibited OS cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, a dual-luciferase assay validated that vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) was a direct target of miR-185. Overexpression of miR-185 in OC cells reduced VAMP2 expression in protein and mRNA levels, whereas suppression of miR-185 led to an increase in VAMP2 protein and mRNA levels. In addition, we found that VAMP2 silencing inhibited the OS cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Further studies verified that introducing VAMP2 mRNA into cells over-expressing miR-185 abrogated the effects of miR-185 on OS cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Therefore, these results confirm that decreased expression of miR-185 might be regarded as a tumor marker for the early diagnosis of OS, by manipulating of its interactive factors with VAMP2, to provide an effective novel therapeutic target for treatment of the OS tumor.

AB Prior studies indicated that some of transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene variants such as rs7903146, rs12255372 and rs11255372 are constantly associated with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in various populations and ethnic groups. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between TCF7L2 variants (rs7903146, rs11196205, and rs11255372) and T2DM by TaqMan assay. Statistical analysis was performed through SNPAIyze and SPSS. Significant associations of rs7903146 (P = 1.9 x 10-7), and rs11255372 (P = 2.98 x 10-10) both under a dominant model were found. Based on allele frequency, there was a significant difference between the two study groups at rs7903146 and rs12255372 variants (P = 6.8 x 10-10, and P = 9.3 x 10-11, respectively). Two haplotypes including Hap-1 (C-G-G) and Hap-2 (T-G-T) indicated a significant difference between the two study groups (P = 1.174 x 10-9and P = 7.432 x 109 respectively). In conclusion, rs7903146 and rs12255372 were significantly associated with T2DM in the specified Northern Iranian population.

AB The high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signaling pathway regulates the adaptation of fungi to environmental stressors. The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) PBS2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae serves as a scaffold protein in the HOG pathway. We characterized the pgpbs gene of Pyrenophora graminea, which encodes a MAPKK that is 56% orthologous to PBS2 of S. cerevisiae. A cloning technique based on homology was applied to amplify the pgpbs gene. Specific silent mutations then were generated in pgpbs. We evaluated the potential roles of PGPBS in the osmotic response, vegetative differentiation, cell wall integrity, drug resistance, and pathogenicity. Our findings indicated that the pgpbs coding region comprises 2075 base pairs and encodes a protein of 676 amino acids. Mutants deficient in pgpbs expression had significant reductions in vegetative growth and were sensitive to calcofluor white (CFW), an inhibitor of cell wall synthesis. Mutants also lost pathogenicity and were sensitive to an osmotic stress-inducing medium containing NaCl and sorbitol. Moreover, mutants had increased resistance to the dicarboximide fungicide iprodione and the triazole fungicide tebuconazole. These findings suggest that pgpbs is involved in the osmotic and ionic stress responses, vegetative differentiation, cell wall integrity, virulence, and tolerance to iprodione and tebuconazole. We expect that our findings will help elucidate the pathogenesis of barley leaf stripe and will inform strategies for breeding resistance to this disease.

AB Objective: To investigate the expression of the lncRNA ZFAS1 in cervical cancer and its relationship with patient prognosis and cervical cancer cell chemosensitivity.
   Methods: The expression of ZFAS1 in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines was detected by qRT-PCR. The cervical cancer CaSki and the HeLa cell lines were transfected to be divided into Blank, siR-Control, and siR-ZFAS1 groups. MTT, wound-healing, and transwell assays were used to evaluate cell biological function. Cisplatin with different concentrations was used to treat cells in different transfection groups, and MTT assays were used to detect the cell growth inhibition rate and the half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) of cisplatin was measured. Cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. A xenograft mouse model was used to investigate the effects of siR-ZFAS1 on the chemosensitivity to cisplatin.
   Results: ZFAS1 was significantly upregulated in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines, and increased ZFAS1 levels led to poor prognoses in patients. In addition, cells in the siR-ZFAS1 group showed remarkably reduced ZFAS1 expression as well as cell proliferation, invasion and migration. After being treated with cisplatin at different concentrations, cells in the siR-ZFAS1 group had dramatically increased cell growth inhibition and apoptosis but lower cisplatin IC50s. In addition, siR-ZFAS1 reduced the volumes and weights of tumors in nude mice treated with cisplatin and enhanced the chemosensitivity of cervical cancer cells to cisplatin.
   Conclusion: The lncRNA ZFAS1 was upregulated in cervical cancer tissues, and its high expression indicated a poor prognosis. Silencing ZFAS1 may inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion and enhance cisplatin chemosensitivity.

AB Multiple-allele-inherited male sterility (MAMS) is important in Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa L. ssp. pekinensis) breeding, but the molecular mechanisms leading to male sterility are poorly understood. In this study, we cloned a novel gene, BrSKS13, that is differentially expressed in fertile and sterile flower buds of Chinese cabbage. BrSKS13 is most similar to Arabidopsis thaliana AT3G13400 (SKS13) and encodes a predicted 61.87 kDa protein with three cupredoxin superfamily conserved domains in the multicopper oxidase family. Semi-quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (sqRT-PCR) showed that expression of BrSKS13 is higher in fertile buds than in sterile buds. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and in situ hybridization showed that BrSKS13 is highly expressed in fertile anthers, peaking at pollen-maturation stage VI, but is weakly expressed in other tissues and floral organs. Expression patterns of BrSKS13 promoter::GUS reporter fusions in Arabidopsis showed that the BrSKS13 promoter drives expression of the GUS gene only in anthers. The relative expression of Brsksl3 in fertile buds was higher than in sterile buds for all other MAMS lines of Chinese cabbage examined. These results suggest that BrSKS13 affects pollen development. In situ hybridization analysis of flower stigmas at different times after pollination showed that BrSKS13 expression was first observed in stigmas and immature seeds at 1 h after pollination, and the signal intensity in seeds increased with increasing maturity. Compared to Col-0, A. thaliana sks13 mutant plants have shorter and fewer siliques, shriveled pollen grains, pollen tube abnormalities, and reduced seed number. The phenotype of sks13 mutant was recovered by over-expressing BrSKS13. Our results suggest that BrSKS13 affects pollen development and the pollination/fertilization process, and will enable further study of the genetic mechanisms underlying MAMS in Chinese cabbage.

AB Mosses are predominant terrestrial vegetation in Antarctica. Their distributions appear to be controlled more by water and salinity. The Antarctic moss Pohlia nutans can tolerate high salt stress. Here, high-throughput sequencing was employed to study the transcriptional characteristics of P. nutans under salt stress. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis showed that 1340 genes were significantly upregulated and 831 genes were markedly downregulated. The expression of representative DEGs including abscisic acid (ABA) and Jasmonates (JAs) pathway-related genes, antioxidant enzyme genes, and flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes were analyzed by real-time PCR and most were upregulated after salt stress. Furthermore, malondialdehyde (MDA) content was significantly increased after salt treatment. The levels of hydroxyl free radical (OH) first rose then quickly decreased. In addition, the activities of antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and peroxidase (POD), and the flavonoid content were enhanced after salt stress. Exogenous application of ABA, Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or proanthocyanidins (PA) improved the performance of P. nutans in response to high salt stress. Furthermore, real-time PCR showed that ABA or MeJA treatment upregulated the gene expression of antioxidant and flavonoid biosynthesis-related enzymes. These results suggest that the responses of P. nutans under salt stress are involved in activating phytohormone signaling pathways which trigger two main antioxidant defense systems (i.e., antioxidant enzymes and flavonoids) for protecting cell and scavenging reactive oxygen species.

AB Organisms use a variety of carbohydrates and metabolic pathways in order to capitalize in their specific environments. Depending upon their habitat, organism employs different types of transporters to maintain the cellular nutritional balance via central metabolism. A major contributor in this process in bacteria is a carbohydrate ABC transporter. The focus of this study is to get an insight into the carbohydrate transport and metabolism of a hot-spring-dwelling bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB8. We applied high-throughput data-mining approaches for identification and characterization of carbohydrate ABC transporters in T. thermophilus HB8. This enabled the identification of 11 putative carbohydrate ABC transport systems. To identify the cognate ligands for these transporters, functional annotation was performed. However, scarcity of homologous-protein's function hinders the process of functional annotation. Thus, to overcome this limitation, we integrated the functional annotation of carbohydrate ABC transporters with their metabolic analysis. Our results demonstrate that out of 11 putative carbohydrate ABC transporters, six are involved in the sugar (four for monosaccharides and polysaccharides-degraded products and two for osmotic regulation), four in phospholipid precursor (namely UgpABCE) and the remaining one in purine uptake. Further, analysis suggests the existence of sharing mechanism of transmembrane domains (TMDs) and/or nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) among the 11 carbohydrate ABC transporters.

AB The distributions of secondary structural elements appear to differ between coding regions (CDS) of mRNAs compared to the untranslated regions (UTRs), presumably as a mechanism to fine-tune gene expression, including efficiency of translation. However, a systematic and comprehensive analysis of secondary structure avoidance because of potential bias in codon usage is difficult as some of the common secondary structures, such as, hairpins can be formed by numerous sequence combinations. Using G-quadruplex (GQ) as the model secondary structure we studied the impact of codon bias on GQs within the CDS. Because GQs can be predicted using specific consensus sequence motifs, they provide an excellent platform for investigation of the selectivity of such putative structures at the codon level. Using a bioinformatics approach, we calculated the frequencies of putative GQs within the CDS of a variety of species. Our results suggest that the most stable GQs appear to be significantly underrepresented within the CDS, through the use of specific synonymous codon combinations. Furthermore, we identified many peptide sequence motifs in which silent mutations can potentially alter translation via stable GQ formation. This work not only provides a comprehensive analysis on how stable secondary structures appear to be avoided within the CDS of mRNA, but also broadens the current understanding of synonymous codon usage as they relate to the structure-function relationship of RNA.

AB Tachykinin 2 (Tac2) is expressed in a number of areas throughout the brain, including the hippocampus. However, knowledge about its function has been only well explored in the hypothalamus in the context of reproductive health. In this study, we identified and validated increased hippocampal Tac2 mRNA expression in response to chronic mild stress in mice. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis showed Tac2 is cis-regulated in the hippocampus. Using a systems genetics approach, we constructed a Tac2 co-expression network to better understand the relationship between Tac2 and the hippocampal stress response. Our network identified 69 total genes associated with Tac2, several of which encode major neuropeptides involved in hippocampal stress signaling as well as critical genes for producing neural plasticity, indicating that Tac2 is involved in these processes. Pathway analysis for the member of Tac2 gene network revealed a strong connection between Tac2 and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, calcium signaling pathway, as well as cardiac muscle contraction. In addition, we also identified 46 stress-related phenotypes, specifically fear conditioning response, that were significantly correlated with Tac2 expression. Our results provide evidence for Tac2 as a strong candidate gene who likely plays a role in hippocampal stress processing and neural plasticity.

AB The COMT gene encodes for catechol-O-methyl-transferase, an enzyme playing a major role in regulation of synaptic catecholamine neurotransmitters. Investigating 4 markers of the COMT gene (rs2020917, rs4818, rs4680, rs9332377) in 6 Tunisian populations and a pool of Libyans. Our objective was to determine the distribution of allelic, genotypic and haplotypic frequencies by comparison to other populations of the 1000 genomes project and 59 populations from the Kidd Lab dataset.
   The allelic frequencies established for these SNPs in the North African populations are similar to those of Europeans and South Asians. Linkage disequilibrium between these SNPs and haplotypes frequencies are different between populations whose clustering in principal components analysis (PCA) according to their geographic origin was more significant using haplotypic frequencies.
   COMT activity prediction by haplotypes genotyping could be limited to rs4818-rs4680 micro-haplotypes. The Low activity haplotype (CG) displays the highest frequency in African populations (55%), in the 59 Kidd Lab populations we found also that Sub-Saharan Africans, Native Americans, and some East Asian and Pacific Island populations all have frequencies in the 50-81% range for (CG) where as its lowest frequency was found in Europeans (10%), this results have been also confirmed for Southwest Asians. North Africans and South Asians with intermediate frequencies have approximately similar values (20% and 25%). Europeans show the highest frequencies of haplotypes with predicted High and Medium activity in contrast to Africans. North Africans and South Asians present similar results for all the category of the COMT activity prediction by haplotypes genotyping.
   The high level of genetic diversity of COMT haplotypes, not only allows distinction between populations according to their history settlement, origin and ethnicity, it constitutes a basis for studies of association of the COMT gene polymorphism with pathologies, drugs response and for forensic investigation in North African populations.

AB Anthurium andraeanum is a high-grade potted flower that enjoys global popularity. Its floral organs have been substantially modified, and its ornamental value is based on its petaloid bracts. MADS-box gene products are important transcription factors that control plant development. In particular, the APETALA1 (AP1)/FRUITFULL (FUL) family of MADS-box genes plays a key role in flowering transitions and out-whorl floral organ identity specification. In this report, one FUL-like gene was cloned from Anthurium andraeanum and named AaFUL1 after bioinformatics identification. Subsequent subcellular localization experiments confirmed that the AaFUL1 protein was located in the nucleus, and data obtained from an expression analysis indicated that the relative expression level of AaFUL1 was the highest in bracts and inflorescences, while its expression was relatively low in stems and roots. Next, an AaFUL1 overexpression vector was constructed and ectopically expressed in tobacco. The transformants did not show any early flowering phenotype, but the average internode length of the inflorescence branch was significantly higher than that observed in the control, and its petal color had sub-stantially faded. The morphology of the petal and pistil was clearly changed, the fruit was deformed, and the seed was largely aborted. These data indicate that even though the sequence of AaFUL1 is relatively conserved, its function differs from that of other orthologs, and the FUL subfamily of MADS-box transcription factors may have taken on new functions during the evolution processes. The results of this experiment enrich our knowledge of FUL transcription factors in monocotyledon plants.

AB Mounting evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in tumor biology. To date, some lncRNAs have been found to be involved in competitive binding of miRNAs, a major group of competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), through participation in a regulatory network of protein-coding gene expression. However, the functional roles of lncRNA-mediated ceRNAs in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) have rarely been reported. Here, we construct a hypothetical ceRNA network by analyzing differential expression of lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs obtained from 96 ESCC tissues and 13 normal tissues in the Cancer Genome Atlas. Ultimately, 95 lncRNAs, 9 miRNAs, and 40 mRNAs were identified (fold change > 1.5, P < .05) and included in the ceRNA network for ESCC. Moreover, three lncRNAs (IGF2-AS, MUC2 and SOX2-OT) were found to be significantly associated with overall survival (log-rank test, P < .05), and further experiments revealed that lncRNA DLX6-AS1 knockdown inhibited the proliferation and invasion of esophageal cancer cells by enhancing the endogenous function of mTOR. We believe that the identified ceRNA network can facilitate a better understanding of lncRNA-related mechanisms in ESCC.

AB Background and aims: The extracellular calcium-binding protein family member thrombospondin-4 (THBS4) regulates cell migration, proliferation, attachment, adhesion, angiogenesis, neural development, tissue structure, organ development, pain signal transduction, and tumor growth. The aim of this study was to study THBS4 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and determine if it was a prognostic marker for this malignancy.
   Methods: We used immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays to evaluate THBS4 expression in 84 HCC and matched para-cancerous tissues. Then, we assessed relationships between THBS4 expression and clinicopathological parameters.
   Results: THBS4 expression was higher in HCCs than in matched para-cancerous tissues (P < 0.001). There was a significant correlation between high THBS4 levels and preoperative serum alanine aminotransferase (P < 0.04). In HCC patients, high THBS4 expression was associated with shorter overall and disease-free survival compared with low THBS4 expression. Additionally, subgroup analysis showed that high THBS4 levels were only associated with poor overall survival for alpha-fetoprotein > 40 ng/mL (P = 0.028) and cirrhosis (P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that high THBS4 expression was an independent prognostic factor for both overall and disease-free survival.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that THBS4 may play a role in HCC development, and thus may be an independent prognostic marker and/or potential therapeutic target for HCC patients.

AB The uptake and translocation of non-essential heavy metals in plant are always through metal transporters for essential micronutrient transport, such as NRAMP (Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein). NRAMPs from different species exhibit different biological functions, although their sequences are highly identical. In the present study, a NRAMP6 was isolated from Ailanmai (Triticum turgidum L. ssp. turgidum). TtNRAMP6, localized on chromosome 3B, was mainly expressed in roots, followed by other tissues varied with different growth stages. At the seedling stage, TtNRAMP6 was significantly regulated by Cd stress in roots, but not by the deficiency of Zn, Fe or Mg. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that TtNRAMP6 encoded a plasma membrane protein. Expressing-TtNRAMP6 significantly enhanced the Cd concentration in yeast, and increased the Cd sensitivity. Meanwhile, overexpression of TtNRAMP6 also increased the Cd concentration in roots, stems, leaves and the whole plant of Arabidopsis, which indicated that overexpression of TtNRAMP6 enhanced the Cd accumulation. Thus, genetic manipulation of TtNRAMP6 may reduce the uptake of Cd from external solution to wheat, finally protecting the safety of wheat food.

AB Numerical solutions of the acoustic wave equation, especially in anisotropic media, is crucial to seismic modeling, imaging and inversion as it provides efficient, practical, and stable approximate representation of the medium. However, a clean implementation (free of shear wave artifacts and dispersion) of wave propagation, especially in anisotropic media, requires an integral operator, the direct evaluation of which is extremely expensive. Recently, the low-rank method was proposed to provide a good approximation to the integral operator utilizing Fourier transforms. Thus, we propose to split the integral operator into two terms. The first term provides a differential operator that approximates that can be approximated with a standard finite-difference method. We, then, apply the low-rank approximation on the residual term of the finite-difference operator. We implement the two terms in two complementing steps, in which the spectral step corrects for any errors admitted by the finite difference step. Even though we utilize finite-difference approximations, the resulting algorithm admits spectral accuracy. Also, through the finite difference step, the method can deal approximately with the free surface and absorbing boundary conditions in a straight forward manner. Numerical examples show that the method is of high accuracy and efficiency. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We study numerical methods for porous media equation (PME). There are two important characteristics: the finite speed propagation of the free boundary and the potential waiting time, which make the problem difficult to handle. Based on different dissipative energy laws, we develop two numerical schemes by an energetic variational approach. Firstly, based on f log f as the total energy form of the dissipative law, we obtain the trajectory equation, and then construct a fully discrete scheme. It is proved that the scheme is uniquely solvable on an admissible convex set by taking the advantage of the singularity of the total energy. Next, based on 1/(2f) as the total energy form of the dissipation law, we construct a linear numerical scheme for the corresponding trajectory equation. Both schemes preserve the corresponding discrete dissipation law. Meanwhile, under some smoothness assumption, both schemes are second-order convergent in space and first-order convergent in time. Each scheme yields a good approximation for the solution and the free boundary. No oscillation is observed for the numerical solution around the free boundary. Furthermore, the waiting time problem could be naturally treated, which has been a well-known difficult issue for all the existing methods. Due to its linear nature, the second scheme is more efficient. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we construct an efficient numerical scheme for full-potential electronic structure calculations of periodic systems. In this scheme, the computational domain is decomposed into a set of atomic spheres and an interstitial region, and different basis functions are used in different regions: radial basis functions times spherical harmonics in the atomic spheres and plane waves in the interstitial region. These parts are then patched together by discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method. Our scheme has the same philosophy as the widely used (L)APW methods in materials science, but possesses systematically spectral convergence rate. We provide a rigorous a priori error analysis of the DG approximations for the linear eigenvalue problems, and present some numerical simulations in electronic structure calculations.

AB Two-dimensional three-temperature (2-D 3-T) energy equations are a type of strongly nonlinear system that describe the energy diffusion and exchange between an electron and a photon or ion. In multi-physics simulations, the process of energy diffusion and exchange is coupled with some other physical processes, such as fluid dynamics. Typically, the Lagrangian method is employed in radiation hydrodynamics simulations. Consequently, the 3-T energy equations should be discretized on deforming meshes, which are moved with dynamics. In 2-D deforming meshes, a nine-point scheme must be employed to discretize the 3-T energy equations. Because the energy diffusion and swapping coefficients are strongly nonlinearly dependent on the temperature, and some physical parameters are discontinuous across the material interfaces, it is a challenge to solve the discretized nonlinear algebraic equations in multi-physics and multi-material applications. A Newton Krylov method is used to solve the discretized 2-D 3-T energy equations. Based on the physical properties and the characteristics of the equations, four types of operator based preconditioners are constructed. Numerical results show that all the preconditioning methods considered in this study are very effective. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we present an efficient and accurate integral equation method to compute the scattering resonances for a subwavelength metallic slit structure. A new boundary integral equation is derived for the scattering problem, and the computation of scattering resonances is reduced to solving the eigenvalues of the corresponding homogeneous formulation over the complex plane. The integral operators are evaluated with high-order precisions by accurate calculations of the Green's functions for the layered medium and accelerated computation of the slit Green's function. The Newton's method is employed for solving the eigenvalues of the boundary integral formulation. We propose an effective strategy for obtaining the initial guesses of scattering resonances by introducing an approximate model for the scattering problem, for which the leading orders of the resonances are derived by asymptotic analysis. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present an algorithm for constructing numerical solutions to one-dimensional nonlinear, variable coefficient boundary value problems. This scheme is based upon applying the Homotopy Analysis Method (HAM) to decompose a nonlinear differential equation into a series of linear differential equations that can be solved using a sparse, spectrally accurate Gegenbauer discretisation. Uniquely for nonlinear methods, our scheme involves constructing a single, sparse matrix operator that is repeatedly solved in order to solve the full nonlinear problem. As such, the resulting scheme scales quasi-linearly with respect to the grid resolution. We demonstrate the accuracy, and computational scaling of this method by examining a fourth-order nonlinear variable coefficient boundary value problem by comparing the scheme to Newton-Iteration and the Spectral Homotopy Analysis Method, which is the most commonly used implementation of the HAM.

AB In this paper, we propose a simple fast Fourier spectral method for the inelastic Boltzmann collision operator, with its application to one of the widely used models of granular gases, the inelastic Boltzmann equation with a heating source. Compared to the direct Fourier spectral method, our fast algorithm reduces the computational complexity from O (N-6) to O (MN4 logN) per evaluation of the collision operator in three dimensions, where N is the number of discretization points in each velocity dimension and M << N-2 is the number of quadrature points used on the unit sphere. We test the numerical accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method in both two dimensional and three dimensional examples, where in the latter case the famous Haff's cooling law for granular flows is successfully recovered.

AB In this paper, we are interested in the resolution of the time-dependent problem of particle transport in a media whose composition is uncertain. The most common resolution strategy consists of running, at prescribed points in uncertain space (at experimental designs points), a simulation device as a black-box. This ensures performing the uncertainty propagation resolution (i.e. resolution of SPDE). This kind of strategy is commonly called non intrusive. The non-intrusive resolution can be carried with Monte-Carlo, quasi Monte-Carlo, generalized Polynomial Chaos etc. The latter is of interest in this paper for its fast convergence rate. First, we go over and illustrate the main drawbacks of the non-intrusive (gPC or otherwise) uncertainty propagation resolution for the linear Boltzmann equation in a simplified configuration. We then build a new gPC based MC scheme solving intrusively the uncertain counterpart of the problem. The paper ends with some numerical examples. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this work we develop a scalable computational framework for the solution of PDE-constrained optimal control problems under high-dimensional uncertainty. Specifically, we consider a mean-variance formulation of the control objective and employ a Taylor expansion with respect to the uncertain parameter field either to directly approximate the control objective or as a control variate for variance reduction. The expressions for the mean and variance of the Taylor approximation are known analytically, although their evaluation requires efficient computation of the trace of the (preconditioned) Hessian of the control objective. We propose to estimate this trace by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem using a randomized algorithm that only requires the action of the Hessian on a small number of random directions. Then, the computational work does not depend on the nominal dimension of the uncertain parameter, but depends only on the effective dimension (i.e., the rank of the preconditioned Hessian), thus ensuring scalability to high-dimensional problems. Moreover, to increase the estimation accuracy of the mean and variance of the control objective by the Taylor approximation, we use it as a control variate for variance reduction, which results in considerable computational savings (several orders of magnitude) compared to a plain Monte Carlo method. In summary, our approach amounts to solving an optimal control problem constrained by the original PDE, the generalized eigenvalue equations at a small number of eigenfunctions, and a set of linearized PDEs that arise from the computation of the gradient and Hessian of the control objective with respect to the uncertain parameter. We use the Lagrangian formalism to derive expressions for the gradient with respect to the control and apply a gradient-based optimization method to solve the problem. We demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of the proposed computational method for two examples with high-dimensional uncertain parameters: subsurface flow in a porous medium modeled as an elliptic PDE, and turbulent jet flow modeled by the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations coupled with a nonlinear advection-diffusion equation characterizing model uncertainty. In particular, for the latter more challenging example we show scalability of our algorithm up to one million parameters resulting from discretization of the uncertain parameter field.

AB This study improves upon the physics-based pairwise interaction extended point-particle (PIEP) model. The PIEP model leverages our physical understanding to predict fluid mediated interactions between solid particles [1,2]. By considering the relative location of neighboring particles, the PIEP model is able to provide better predictions than existing drag models. While the current physical PIEP model is a powerful tool, its assumptions lead to increased error in flows with higher particle volume fractions. To reduce this error, a regression algorithm makes direct use of the results of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of an array of monodisperse solid particles subjected to uniform ambient flow at varying Reynolds numbers. The resulting statistical model and the physical PIEP model are superimposed to construct a hybrid, physics-based data-driven PIEP model. It must be noted that the performance of a pure data-driven approach without the model-form provided by the physical PIEP model is substantially inferior. The hybrid model's predictive capabilities are analyzed using additional DNS data that was not part of training the data-driven model. In every case tested, the hybrid models resulting from the regression were capable of (1) improving upon the physical PIEP model's prediction and (2) recovering underlying relevant physics from the DNS data. As the particle volume fraction increases, the physical PIEP model loses the ability to approximate the forces experienced by the particles, but the statistical model continues to produce accurate approximations.

Even fairly simple partial differential equations end up very convoluted in their discretized form, making them difficult to implement and manage. Spatial discretizations using so called summation-by-parts operators have mitigated this issue to some extent, particularly on rectangular domains, making it possible to formulate stable discretizations in a compact and understandable manner. However, the simplicity of these formulations is lost for curvilinear grids, where the standard procedure is to transform the grid to a rectangular one, and change the structure of the original equation.
   In this paper we reinterpret the grid transformation as a transformation of the summationby-parts operators. This results in operators acting directly on the curvilinear grid. Together with previous developments in the field of nonconforming grid couplings we can formulate simple, implementable, and provably stable schemes on general nonconforming curvilinear grids. The theory is applicable to methods on summation-by-parts form, including finite differences, discontinuous Galerkin spectral element, finite volume, and flux reconstruction methods. Time dependent advection-diffusion simulations corroborate the theoretical development. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We develop a unified Petrov-Galerkin spectral method for a class of fractional partial differential equations with two-sided derivatives and constant coefficients of the form (0)D(t)(2 tau)u + Sigma(d)(i=1)[Cl-i(ai) D(xi)(2 mu i)u+C-ri(xi) D(bi)(2 mu i)u ] + gamma u = Sigma(d)(j=1) [kappa(lj aj) D-xj(2 nu j) u + kappa(rj xj) D-bj(2 nu j) u] + f, where 2 tau is an element of (0, 2), 2 tau not similar or equal to 1, 2 mu(i) is an element of (0, 1) and 2 nu(j) is an element of (1, 2), in a (1 +d)-dimensional space-time hypercube, d = 1, 2, 3, ..., subject to homogeneous Dirichlet initial/boundary conditions. We employ the eigenfunctions of the fractional Sturm-Liouville eigen-problems of the first kind in [1], called Jacobi poly-fractonomials, as temporal bases, and the eigen-functions of the boundary-value problem of the second kind as temporal test functions. Next, we construct our spatial basis/test functions using Legendre polynomials, yielding mass matrices being independent of the spatial fractional orders (mu(i), nu(j) , i , j = 1, 2, ..., d). Furthermore, we formulate a novel unified fast linear solver for the resulting highdimensional linear system based on the solution of generalized eigen-problem of spatial mass matrices with respect to the corresponding stiffness matrices, hence, making the complexity of the problem optimal, i.e., O(Nd+2). We carry out several numerical test cases to examine the CPU time and convergence rate of the method. The corresponding stability and error analysis of the Petrov-Galerkin method are carried out in [2]. Published by Elsevier Inc.

SO MATERIALS LETTERS

DE Biomaterials; Nanocomposites; Structural
AB In this work, a biocompatible and stretchable double-carrier drug delivery system was developed for wound dressing application. Quinolone antibiotics enoxacin (ENO) was loaded into Mg-Al layered double hydroxide (LDH) first, and then the as-prepared LDH-ENO nanoparticles were incorporated into polyurethane-polyvinyl alcohol (PU-PVA) hydrogel to build a double-carrier drug delivery system. The results suggested that the introduction of the LDH-ENO nanoparticles into PU-PVA network significantly improved the mechanical properties and biocompatibility of PU-PVA hydrogel. The PU-PVA/LDH-ENO nanocomposite hydrogel, as a double-carrier, obviously delayed the release of the ENO molecules. It suggests that PU-PVA/LDH-ENO nanocomposite hydrogel should be a promising candidate for wound healing applications, especially for the healing of chronic wounds. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB A catalase-inorganic hybrid microflowers (Cat-HMFs) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was fabricated for amperometric detection of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Cat-HMFs were prepared by the coprecipitation of catalase and copper phosphate crystals via sonochemistry. Cat-HMFs/GCE showed linear current responses under the H2O2 concentration of 100 mu M-10 mM, and the detection limit is 50 mu M. After stored under ambient conditions for 30 days, Cat-HMFs/GCE still remained 92% of its initial activity, which demonstrates Cat-HMFs/GCE has excellent long-term stability. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The halloysite/3-Aminopropyltrietthoxysilane/gentamicin hybrid was obtained as a novel carrier for sustained drug release in antimicrobial treatment. The nanocarrier was prepared by functionalizing the halloysite surface with the 3-Aminopropyltrietthoxysilane, which was introduced into the system as a coupling agent to efficiently bond the drug in to the halloysite lumen. The interaction between gentamicin, silane and halloysite as well as the antimicrobial susceptibility against E. coli, S. aureus and S. epidermidis were investigated. The results indicate that silane grafting combined with intercalation of gentamicin resulted in efficient drug bonding to the inner surface of halloysite and ultimately extended drug release from the tested hybrid.

AB In this work, novel BCP (beta-CPP, beta-Ca2P2O7/(beta-TCP, beta-Ca-3(PO4)(2)) bioceramics have been synthesized by wet chemical precipitation using lime mud waste from cellulose industry as inexpensive sustainable CaCO3 precursor source. The synthesized BCP bioceramics have been characterized regarding to X-ray diffraction (XRD), Rietveld refinement, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results indicated that the amounts of the phases beta-CPP and beta-TCP in the biphasic mixtures depend on the different HNO3 molar concentrations used in the synthesis. In addition, the BCP (beta-CPP/(beta-TCP) powders exhibited average crystallite size in the range of 55.56 to 59.85 nm. Such novel BCP nanopowders produced by using CaCO3 from lime mud waste have high potential for biomedical applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Linear ferroelectric response and energy storage efficiency was checked from polarization loops. Magnetic characterization revealed that rare earth zirconates had small values of coercivity and remanence which argued mainly a superparamagnetic nature of the samples. Tailoring of dielectric properties with the magnetic field and a possible origin of magneto-dielectric coupling was also investigated. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, ultrafine-grained W-Cu composites without and with reinforcement of tungsten fibers (W-f) were prepared by successive processes of mechanical alloying, cold pressing, sintering and infiltration. For W-f reinforced W-Cu composite, the introduction of W-f coated with magnetron sputtered Cr, improved the sinterability and contiguity of W-f with the neighboring W powders, eliminating porosity between W-f and the matrix and improving the interfacial strength. Further compressive tests demonstrated that, compared with conventional commercial W-Cu composite made of micron-sized tungsten powders, for the ultrafine-grained W-Cu composite reinforced with Cr-coated W-f, the compressive strength increased dramatically by 122.9%, 43.6% and 91.3%, when deformed at room temperature, 300 degrees C and 500 degrees C, respectively. Besides, the electrical breakdown strength increased impressively by 118%, which can be ascribed to the arc dispersion from the increased fraction of grain boundaries in the ultrafine-grained structure free from blind holes.

AB Mesoporous silica vesicles (MSVs) were prepared using a binary mixed-template system. Cetylpyridinium bromide (CTPB) and cationic fluorocarbon surfactant (FC-4) were employed as templates. The mixed-template synthesis led to MSV materials with two different morphologies. The mesopore expansion and template removal were simultaneously achieved by Ca ion-etching. The Ca ion-etching process not only removed the templates but also generated ultra-large pores through partial collapse of several mesopores. Calcined MSV with smaller mesopores showed better adsorption of small lysozyme than did the etched MSV (Ca-MSV). Contrarily, Ca-MSV showed slightly enhanced adsorption abilities for ovalbumin and hemoglobin than did calcined MSV. Ca-MSV was especially good at sequestering large protein, such as bovine serum albumin. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report a turn-on type mechanochromic luminescent (MCL) material in this work. The molecular design, including the electron donor-acceptor (D-A) pairs and single-bond rotation, endows the material with both intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and aggregation-enhanced emission (AEE) nature. It shows remarkable emission enhancement with large blue-shift upon grinding and is able to convert back to the initial state after thermal treatment, suggesting high sensitivity and fatigue resistance. An information carrier based on mechanochromic material is developed, by which the binary data can be written by mechanical encoding and erased by heating. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID RHENIUM; LI
AB 3D hierarchical nitrogen-doped ReS2 nanosheets/carbon composites were obtained by a solvothermal synthesis involving the reaction of Re-2(CO)(10) with sulfur, melamine and solvents (toluene/water). The incorporation of N atoms in the resulting ReS2/C composites was directed by the aggregation of carbonaceous matter from solvent and melamine, where the composite synthesized with toluene showed higher N content. This synthesis route, based on the selection of solvent, provides a simple approach to incorporate N atoms in a poorly crystalline structure for developing new functional ReS2 materials.

AB The effect of electrolyzed water in controlling the setting behavior of cement paste was investigated in this study. The distilled, as well as the 30 min electrolyzed water, was used to prepare the cement paste. Analyzing the results, the final setting time of control cement (CC) paste, as well as the 30 min electrolyzed water based cement (EC) paste, was measured to be 172 +/- 5 min and 108 +/- 4 min, respectively. The reduction of setting time is due to the quick hydration of cement clinkers. Based on the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, the early setting and hydration performance of cement has been justified.

AB Here we present the simple and effective fabrication method of an array of gold microneedles (AuMNs) via the casting of conductive gold ink. To demonstrate the potential of MN arrays as electrochemical biosensors we functionalized AuMNs with an epoxy- and ferrocene-functional polymeric mediator and covalently immobilised urease. The performance of the MN array biosensor for urea detection was assessed in artificial interstitial fluid and epidermal/skin mimic, both spiked with urea. The analytical performance of MN biosensor shows that urea is detected in the range of 50-2500 mu M, with a calculated limit of detection of 2.8 mu M and sensitivity of 31 nA/mM. The results reveal that these MN-based biosensors may underpin the development of wearable real-time monitoring devices. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Self-assembled flowers of (Na0.5La0.5)MoO4:Eu3+ with many petals have been successfully synthesized by using the Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid mediated hydrothermal route. X-ray diffraction patterns(XRD) indicated that (Na0.5La0.5)MoO4:Eu3+ crystallized into a scheelite tetragonal structure with the space group I4(1)/a. A significant spectral blue shift was observed when the Eu3+ doping concentration increased from 2 mol% to 10 mol%. Upon 395 nm excitation, the flower-like (Na0.5La0.5)MoO4:Eu3+ structures showed a strong emission in the red region due to the characteristic D-5(0)-> F-7(2) transition of Eu3+. The effect of doping content of Eu3+ (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 mol%) on the luminescence properties of (Na0.5La0.5) MoO4 have been reported. To check the color purity and emission quality of the phosphors, photometric parameters were investigated. The percentage of luminous efficiency of as-synthesized micro flowers was found to be 43%, which has the potential to be used in phosphor converted light emitting diodes (LED). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, a fully laminated Ti-48Al-2Nb-2Cr alloy plate with no cracks and aluminum loss is successfully fabricated using laser additive manufacturing technique. A well-aligned micro-columnar microstructure is expected to grow along the deposition direction. Attributed to the rapid cooling, micro-segregation between interdendritic and dendrite areas is observed in the fabricated alloy. Meanwhile, rapid cooling results in existence of B2 phases in the center of dendrites, which will then decompose with the gradual coarsening of alpha(2)/gamma lamella under subsequent thermal cycling. Additionally, dominant growth of (1 1 0)(beta) during solidification of molten pool is predicted, which is the preference growth direction of primary beta phase. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI Optimization of the microstructure and properties of Al2O3-ZrO2
   reticulated porous ceramics via in-situ synthesis of mullite whiskers
   and flowing-liquid phase

ID STRENGTH
AB Al2O3-ZrO2 reticulated porous ceramics (RPCs) with excellent properties and microstructure are prepared by using ceramic slurries coated polymeric sponges as novel organic templates. In this method, polymeric foams are first coated with slurries included AIF(3), clay, alpha-Al2O3 and CeO2, before coating them with Al2O3-ZrO2 slurries, then calcined at 1480 degrees C for 3 h. The Al2O3-ZrO2 RPCs show a high strength and excellent microstructure. Meanwhile, the thermal shock resistance of the Al2O3-ZrO2 RPCs is improved significantly. This enhancement is attributed not only to the optimization of the microstructure, but also to the reinforcement of mullite whiskers. In addition, owing to the difference in the thermal expansion coefficients between mullite whiskers and matrix, the compressive residual stress can be formed within the matrix (tangential direction), which improves the thermal shock resistance of the resultant RPCs remarkably.

AB Here, para-disodium-2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone (p-Na2C6H2O6 ) was successfully prepared and evaluated as electrode for sodium-ion and potassium-ion batteries. Benefiting from salinization, p-Na2C6H2O6 delivers a high capacity of 121 mA h g( 1) over 50 cycles at 0.1 C and superior rate and cycling life for SIBs. Besides, when tested in KlBs, a reversible capacity of 190.6 mA h g( 1) was also achieved at 0.1 C. We believe this work could boost the development of other similar organic materials.
