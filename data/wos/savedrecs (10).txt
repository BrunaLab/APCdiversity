AB Groundwater pH is one of the most important geochemical parameters in controlling the interfacial reactions of zero-valent iron (ZVI) with water and contaminants. Ball milled, microscale ZVI (mZVl(bm)) efficiently dechlorinated TCE at initial stage (<24 h) at pH 6-7 but got passivated at later stage due to pH rise caused by iron corrosion. At pH > 9, mZVl(bm) almost completely lost its reactivity. In contrast, ball milled, sulfidated microscale ZVI (S-mZVl(bm)) didn't experience any reactivity loss during the whole reaction stage across pH 6-10 and could efficiently dechlorinate TCE at pH 10 with a reaction rate of 0.03 h(-1). Increasing pH from 6 to 9 also enhanced electron utilization efficiency from 0.95% to 5.3%, and from 3.2% to 22%, for mZVl(bm) and S-mZVl(bm), respectively. SEM images of the reacted particles showed that the corrosion product layer on S-mZVl(bm) had a puffy/porous structure while that on mZVl(bm) was dense, which may account for the mitigated passivation of S-mZVl(bm) under alkaline pHs. Density functional theory calculations show that covered S atoms on the Fe(100) surface weaken the interactions of H2O molecules with Fe surfaces, which renders the sulfidated Fe surface inefficient for H2O dissociation and resistant to surface passivation. The observation from this study provides important implication that natural sulfidation of ZVI may largely contribute to the long-term (>10 years) efficiency of TCE decontamination by permeable reactive barriers with pore water pH above 9.

AB Wet chemical approach is widely applied for P extraction from incinerated sewage sludge ash (ISSA) due to the relatively simple process and low lost. In this study, H2SO4 and H2C2O4 were compared to recover P from ISSA through three steps of acid leaching, cation exchange resin (CER) purification and precipitation. Transformations of P speciation and mineral phases in ISSA from 600 to 900 degrees C were studied. The results showed that the ISSA samples were mainly composed of inorganic P (IP), and part of non-apatite IP (NAIP, mainly AlPO4) would transform to apatite P (AP, Ca-3(PO4)(2)) with the increase in temperature. The ratio of NAIP to IP dropped from 71.9% at 600 degrees C to 53.7% at 900 degrees C. Effect of acid concentration on the leaching efficiency of P from the ISSA samples incinerated at different temperatures by H2SO4 and H2C2O4 was investigated, and the leaching behaviors of key elements of P, Ca, Al and Fe were compared. H2C2O4 exhibited a better performance than H2SO4 for the leaching efficiency of P. Severe sintering of ash particles occurred at temperature >800 degrees C inhibited the P leaching by H2SO4. During CER purification, the impurity elements in the H2SO4 leachate were easily removed by CER, whereas the Al and Fe elements in the H2C2O4 leachate were hardly removed due to the formation of anionic complexes between Al3+/Fe3+ and oxalic ions. Finally, high-purity struvite product was synthesized from the purified H2SO4 leachate, which could be directly utilized as a fertilizer with negligible environmental risk. Amorphous aluminum and iron hydroxyphosphates were obtained from the H2C2O4 leachate. This study provides insights for P recovery from ISSA samples by different acid leaching systems.

AB Although polyhalogenated carbazoles (PHCZs) have been increasingly detected in aquatic environments, studies on their source and formation are extremely scarce. After investigation of PHCZs and carbazole in drinking water, an overlooked formation route of chloro/bromo-CZs was now proposed as aqueous chlorination of residual carbazole under bromide condition. Four groups of PHCZ, including mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-halogenated groups, were identified in chlorinated drinking water, and the mechanism of the formation of the four groups of PHCZs was proposed. Twenty-six PHCZ congeners, including chloro-, bromo-, and chlorobromo-mixed species, were thoroughly studied and it was revealed for the first time the four groups of PHCZs shifted from chlorinated to being more brominated with increasing bromide level. The speciation of the four groups of PHCZs was modeled. It was revealed that the shift of PHCZs from chlorinated to being more brominated was caused by the reactivity differences between HOCl and HOBr in reactions forming PHCZs. Furthermore, this study revealed that the species numbers and concentrations of PHCZs formed in chlorination were much higher than those in chloramination, and the formation of PHCZs was decreased by similar to 50% with an increase of pH from 6.0 to 9.0. This study of the variety of PHCZs in chlorinated water is an important step toward revealing the occurrence of PHCZs in aquatic environments. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Geoengineering techniques have been used to control phosphorus and cyanobacteria in lakes promising greater and quicker chemical and ecological recovery. Techniques that use coagulants and clays to remove particulates and dissolved phosphorus from the water column have received great. In this study, bench-scale "flock & sink" assays were carried out to evaluate the efficiency of the coagulants aluminium sulphate (SUL), polyaluminium chloride (PAC) and chitosan (CHI), alone and combined with natural bentonite clays (BEN) and lanthanum-modified bentonite (LMB), to remove of phosphorus from a eutrophic reservoir in a semi-arid region of Brazil. In addition, the study seeks to assess the effects on the cyanobacteria density and the intra- and extracellular concentrations of cyanotoxins after the application of these geoengineering materials. The SUL and PAC coagulants effectively reduced the total phosphorus (TP), reactive soluble phosphorus (SRP), turbidity, chlorophyll-a, cyanobacteria density and intracellular microcystin, whereas CHI showed a low removal efficiency. lanthanum-modified bentonite proved to be more effective than BEN; however, the application of the coagulants only was sufficient to successfully remove phosphorus and cyanobacteria from the water column. In addition, the efficiency of the "flock & sink" technique in cell removal varied among the cyanobacteria species. Small colonial species such as Aphanocapsa delicatissima, Merismopedia glauca and Merismopedia tenuissima were removed regardless of the treatment used, including those with CHI and BEN. As for the filamentous cyanobacteria, Cylin-drospermopsis raciborskii, Geitlerinema amphibium, Planktothrbc agardhii and Pseudanabaena catenata, removal was achieved only using PAC, SUL and LMB alone or when combined. The intracellular concentrations of saxitoxin and cylindrospermopsin and the extracellular fraction of these cyanotoxins and of microcystin were not influenced by the application of coagulants and clays. This indicates that cell lysis did not occur with the addition of the geoengineering materials. These results demonstrate that the "flock & sink" technique could be used for restoration of eutrophic waters. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biological processes and chemical precipitation in combination with polishing by granular media or membrane filtration can remove 90-95% of the phosphorus (P) from wastewater. However, reducing the concentration to levels near those in high-quality receiving waters requires additional advanced treatment, typically including adsorption onto specialty media. These processes are often costly, they can be hard to control when the P loading varies, and their effectiveness can be compromised by the presence of competing adsorbates in the water. In this work, a novel process that might mitigate or overcome some of these challenges was explored. In the process, water is treated by passage through micron-sized adsorbent particles (Heated Aluminum Oxide Particles, HAOPs) packed in a layer that is < 1 mm thick, thus combining the attractive features of very small particles with those of flow through packed media.
   In laboratory tests using both synthetic feed and the effluent from an MBR at a full-scale wastewater treatment plant, the process removed P very efficiently until the HAOPs' capacity was nearly exhausted, at which point rapid breakthrough of P occurred. The removal capacity was proportional to the thickness of the HAOPs layer and declined by only similar to 20% when SO42-, Cl-, and NO3 were all added to the MBR effluent at concentrations of 30 mM (2880, 1065, and 1860 mg/L, respectively). Increasing the solution pH from 7.0 to 8.5 had a similar effect, and increasing the flux of water through the adsorbent layer from 200 to 600 LMH had an even smaller effect (similar to 10% reduction in removal capacity). In 18 days of continuous pilot-scale operation at the treatment plant, the process performed well, achieving 99.5% P removal steadily during the final seven days of testing, during which the P concentration in the feed ranged from 4 to 9 mg/L. The process also removed 52% of the organic matter in the MBR effluent, as represented by UV254. The sludge generated by the process was extremely easy to dewater and dry. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this work, UV and UV/chlorine (UV/Cl) were employed to enhance powdered activated carbon (PAC) adsorption pretreatment prior to ultrafiltration process for algae-contaminated surface water treatment. Their performance on membrane fouling mitigation and organic pollutant rejection was systematically evaluated. A comparative experiment was conducted under varying pollution degrees of algal extra-cellular organic matter (EOM) contamination in surface river water. The results indicated that UV/PAC and UV/Cl/PAC pretreatment effectively enhanced the removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV-absorbing at 254 nm (UV254). The characteristics of feed water after pretreatments were investigated through apparent molecular-weight (MW) distribution and fluorescence parallel factor analysis (PAR-AFAC). In regard to membrane fouling mitigation, UV/Cl/PAC noticeably decreased reversible and irreversible fouling resistance simultaneously and UV/PAC preferred reducing reversible membrane fouling. Combined fouling modeling was operated to scrutinize the fouling mitigation mechanisms and standard pore blocking was proved to be dominant during the filtration process. Moreover, the UV/Cl and UV/Cl/PAC pretreatments were proved positive for emerging micropollutants degradation and disinfection byproducts formation potential reduction. The results suggested that UV and UV/CI are likely strategies to enhance the efficiency of PAC adsorption pretreatments prior to ultrafiltration during algae contaminated water treatment.

AB The extracellular electron transfer (EET) efficiency in bioelectrochemical systems has been proven to be dependent on anode potentials. To explore the underlying mechanism, previous studies have mainly focused on EET conduit and bacterial biomass but rarely concerned with the role of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) surrounding electroactive cells. In this study, the response of Geobacter biofilms to anode potentials was investigated with a special emphasis on the mechanistic role of EPS. The electrochemical activities and cell viabilities of Geobacter soli biofilms were simultaneously attenuated at 0.4 and 0.6 V compared to -0.2 and 0 V. It was found that the biofilms (especially the biofilm region closer to electrode surface) grown at -0.2 and 0 V produced relatively more extracellular redox-active proteins and less extracellular polysaccharides, which conferred higher electron accepting/donating capacities to EPS and consequently facilitated EET. Meanwhile, electrically nonconductive extracellular polysaccharide-dominated interior layers were formed in the biofilms grown at 0.4 and 0.6 V, which limited direct EET but might serve as physical barriers for protecting cells in these biofilms from the increasing stress by poised electrodes. These results demonstrated that the production of EPS under different anode potentials might be finely regulated by cells to keep balance between EET efficiency and cell-protection. This study provides a new insight to investigate the Geobacter biofilms coping with various environments, and is useful for optimizing electrochemical activity of anode biofilms.

AB Moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBR) are promising as a post-treatment for removing pharmaceuticals from wastewater. However, the effect of easily degradable carbon sources on the degradation of pharmaceuticals is unclear. This study shows the influence of acetate on the degradation of 26 pharmaceuticals in an MBBR was dose- and compound-dependent: while the degradation of venlafaxine, tramadol and ciprofloxacin was promoted (increase of reaction rate constant (k) by 133%, 212%, 55%) by acetate, its presence caused negative effects on the removal of ibuprofen, citalopram and diclofenac (decrease of k by 76%, 57%, 44%). The deconjugation of acetyl-sulfadiazine was clearly slowed down (decrease of k by 75%) by the dosed acetate, probably due to feedback inhibition by abundant acetate. 17 out of 25 tested compounds were found to be independent of the acetate dosage, which suggested dosing acetate induced minor effects on most of pharmaceuticals' removal. Enrichment of S- or first eluted enantiomer of 4 beta-blockers and the metabolite metoprolol acid was observed. Both non-enantioselective (rapid at elevated compound concentration) and enantioselective enzymes (slower and predominant at lower compound concentration) played a part in the biodegradation. High doses of acetate slowed down the enantiomeric enrichment of atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol and metoprolol acid, which demonstrated that the acetate is able to up- or down-regulate enzymes involved in the enantioselective degradation of 13-blockers and thus reveals a complex co-metabolism relationship between transformation pathways of pharmaceuticals and carbon source.

AB In the last two years, the rapidly rising demand for lithium has exceeded supply, resulting in a sharp increase in the price of the metal. Conventional electric driven membrane processes can separate Li+ from divalent cations, but there is virtually no commercial membrane that can efficiently and selectively extract Li+ from a solution containing chemically similar ions such as Na+ and K+. Here, we show that the different movement behavior of Li+ ion within the sub-nanometre channel leads to Li+ ion-selectivity and high transport rate. Using inexpensive negatively charged 2D subnanometer hydrous phyllosilicate channels with interlayer space of 0.43 nm in a membrane-like morphology, we observed that for an interlayer spacing of below 1 nm, Li+ ions move along the length of the channel by jumping between its two walls. However, for above 1 nm spacing, the ions used only one channel wall to jump and travel. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation also revealed that ions within the nanochannel exhibit acceleration deceleration behavior. Experimental results showed that the nanochannels could selectively transport monovalent ions of Li+> Na+> and K+ while excluding other ions such as Cl- and Ca2+, with the selectivity ratios of 1.26, 1.59 and 1.36 for Li+/Na+, Li+/K+. and Na+/K+ respectively, which far exceed the mobility ratios in traditional porous ion exchange membranes. The findings of this work provide researchers with not only a new understanding of ions movement behavior within subnanometer confined areas but also make a platform for the future design of ion-selective membranes.

AB Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) generated by cyanobacteria is a potent toxin threatening human health. In this study the kinetics and mechanisms of MC-LR elimination from drinking water under solar irradiation with free chlorine (the solar/chlorine process) was evaluated. The rate of MC-LR degradation was dramatically enhanced in the solar/chlorine process (1.1 x 10(-2) s(-1)) compared with chlorination alone (2.6 x 10(-3) s(-1)) or solar irradiation alone (1.2 x 10(-4) s(-1)) with a free chlorine dose of 42 mu M (3.0 mg L-1 as Cl-2). The enhancement was due to the presence of hydroxyl radicals, reactive chlorine species (RCS), and ozone during free chlorine photolysis. The second-order rate constants of Cl (center dot) and Cl-2(center dot-) reacting with MC-LR were determined to be (2.25 +/- 0.07) x 10(10) and (5.58 +/- 0.42) x 10(7) M(-1)s(-1), respectively. Cl (center dot) was the major RCS contributing to MC-LR elimination. The highest MC-LR degradation rate was observed at pH 8.0. Free chlorine, HO (center dot), Cl (center dot) and O-3 together accounted for almost 95% of the MC-LR elimination. Hydroxyl- and chloro-MC-LR were generated in the process, followed by dechlorination, dehydration and cleavage of cyclic structures in MC-LR. Aldehyde- and ketone-MC-LR byproducts were also observed. The destruction of dienes led to a great reduction in MC-LR's toxicity. MC-LR removal in natural water samples under natural sunlight irradiation with free chlorine was demonstrated with limited formation of disinfection byproducts. The solar/chlorine process is an energy-efficient approach for MC-LR control, especially suitable for rural areas or where algal blooming threatens. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This work evaluated the removal of a mixture of eight antibiotics (i.e. ampicillin (AMP), azithromycin (AZM), erythromycin (ERY), clarithromycin (CIA), ofloxacin (OFL), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), trimethoprim (TMP) and tetracycline (TC)) from urban wastewater, by ozonation operated in continuous mode at different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) (i.e. 10, 20, 40 and 60 min) and specific ozone doses (i.e. 0.125, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 gO(3) gDOC(-1)). As expected, the efficiency of ozonation was highly ozone dose-and contact time-dependent. The removal of the parent compounds of the selected antibiotics to levels below their detection limits was achieved with HRT of 40 min and specific ozone dose of 0.125 gO(3) gDOC(-1). The effect of ozonation was also investigated at a microbiological and genomic level, by studying the efficiency of the process with respect to the inactivation of Escherichia coli and antibiotic-resistant E. coli, as well as to the reduction of the abundance of selected antibiotic resistance genes (ARG5). The inactivation of total cultivable E. coli was achieved under the experimental conditions of HRT 40 min and 0.25 gO(3) gDOC(-1), at which all antibiotic compounds were already degraded. The regrowth examinations revealed that higher ozone concentrations were required for the permanent inactivation of E. coli below the Limit of Quantification (<LOQ = 0.01 CFU mL(-1)). Also, the abundance of the examined ARGs (intl1, addA1, dfrA1, qacE Delta 1 and sal1) was found to decrease with increasing HRT and ozone dose. Despite the fact that the mildest operating parameters were able to eliminate the parent compounds of the tested antibiotics in wastewater effluents, it was clearly demonstrated in this study that higher ozone doses were required in order to confer permanent damage and/or death and prevent potential post-treatment re-growth of both total bacteria and ARB, and to reduce the abundance of ARGs below the LOQ, Interestingly, the mineralization of wastewater, in terms of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) removal, was found to be significantly low even when the higher ozone doses were applied, leading to an increased phytotoxicity towards various plant species. The findings of this study clearly underline the importance of properly optimising the ozonation process (e.g. specific ozone dose and contact time) taking into consideration both the bacterial species and associated ARGs, as well as the wastewater physicochemical properties (e.g. DOC), in order to mitigate the spread of ARB&ARGs, as well as to reduce the potential phytotoxicity.

AB Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) has been used as an alternative to chlorine in water purification to reduce the formation of halogenated by-products and give superior inactivation of microorganisms. However, the formation of chlorite (ClO ((2)) over bar) is a major consideration in the application of ClO2. In order to improve understanding in ClO ((2)) over bar formation kinetics and mechanisms, this study investigated the reactions of ClO2 with 30 model compounds, 10 humic substances and 2 surface waters. ClO ((2)) over bar yields were found to be dependent on the distribution of functional groups. ClO2 oxidation of amines, di- and tri-\hydroxybenzenes at pH 7.0 had ClO ((2)) over bar yields >50%, while oxidation of olefins, thiols and benzoquinones had ClO ((2)) over bar yields <50%. ClO<((2))over bar> yields from humic substances depended on the ClO2 dose, pH and varied with different reaction intervals, which mirrored the behavior of the model compounds. Phenolic moieties served as dominant fast-reacting precursors (during the first 5 min of disinfection). Aromatic precursors (e.g., non-phenolic lignins or benzoquinones) contributed to ClO ((2)) over bar formation over longer reaction time (up to 24 h). The total antioxidant capacity (indication of the amount of electron-donating moieties) determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method was a good indicator of ClO2-reactive precursors in waters, which correlated with the ClO2 demand of waters. Waters bearing high total antioxidant capacity tended to generate more ClO ((2)) over bar at equivalent ClO2 exposure, but the prediction in natural water should be conservative.

AB The use of pot ceramic filters PCF to improve the domestic water quality supply has been recognized as an alternative in regions where there is unsecure water treatment or contamination of the treated water during transport and storage and an absence of safe drinking water. The aim of this study was to evaluate a model of PCF impregnated with colloidal silver under three filtration rates (1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 L/h) and three E. coli and Salmonella spp concentrations (10(4), 10(3) and 10(2) CFU/mL). The evaluation was made using spiked water having a turbidity of 29.9 +/- 4.4 NTU and conductivity of 176 +/- 31.7 mu S/cm. The results showed a turbidity removal efficiency of 97% and average effluent of 0.9 NTU. The microbiological efficiency removal was of 2 Log Reduction Value (LRV) for E. coli and 1 LRV for Salmonella spp. There were not found significant statistical differences between the filtration rates and the removal efficiencies for turbidity E. coli and Salmonella spp. It was observed that the microbiological removal efficiency was affected by biofilm formation a phenomenon that was attributed to the presence of Salmonella spp. The combination of chemical and mechanical cleaning methods contributed to the elimination of the biofilm.

AB beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) and 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (DAB) are two newly identified algal toxins, and they may react with chlorine to undergo decomposition and generate disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during pre-chlorination as well as chlorine disinfection. In this study, the decomposition of BMAA and DAB during chlorination and the consequent DBPs formation were investigated. The BMAA and DAB concentrations in source waters were determined, the decomposition kinetics of BMAA and DAB and the formation of DBPs during chlorination were studied, the formation pathways of DBPs from BMAA and DAB were explored, and the factors which may affect the decomposition and DBPs formation were examined. The results revealed that BMAA and DAB were commonly detected in source waters from Taihu Lake, and the highest level of BMAA reached 230.8 ng/L, while the concentrations of DAB were generally around 2.0 ng/L. The decomposition of BMAA and DAB during chlorination both followed pseudo-first-order decay while the decomposition rate constant of DAB was significantly higher than that of BMAA. Trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), and haloacetonitriles (HANs) were all generated during the chlorination of BMAA and DAB with relatively high yields. Notably, the THMs, HAAs, and HANs yields of each carbon atom from BMAA and DAB were significantly higher than that from other organic precursors, and the formation of HANs from DAB was significantly higher than that from BMAA. The formation pathways of DBPs from BMAA and DAB were tentatively proposed and verified through theoretical calculations. Of note, the proposed formation pathways of THMs and HAAs from BMAA were similar to that from DAB, while the proposed formation pathways of HANs from BMAA and DAB showed some differences. Chlorine dose, pH and temperature all affected the decomposition of BMAA and DAB and DBPs formation during chlorination. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dosing ferrous ions (ZVI/Fe2+), combining with oxidants (e.g., H2O2) (ZVI/H2O2), sulfidation treatment (S-ZVI), and introducing a weak magnetic field (ZVI/WMF) have been widely used to enhance the performance of zerovalent iron (ZVI) for reductive removal of contaminants. Taking Se(VI) as a probe contaminant, this study systematically compared the performances of different ZVI systems (i.e., ZVI/Fe2+, ZVI/H2O2, S-ZVI, and ZVI/WMF) for contaminant removal. All the four tested methods could greatly improve the performance of ZVI for Se(VI) removal. Se(VI) was removed by S-ZVI at S/Fe molar ratio of 0.05 with a much greater rate constant than other enhanced-ZVI technologies while the maximum amount of Se(VI) removal was obtained in ZVI/Fe2+ system with Fe2+ applied at 0.5 mM among the four tested enhanced-ZVI technologies at initial pH 6.0. In addition, Se(VI) removal by ZVI/Fe2+ was least influenced by initial pH compared to the other tested enhanced-ZVI systems, implying its good adaptability of pH. The application of these tested methods could significantly increase the electron efficiency from -0.5% to 4.06-8.72% and Fe2+ application was much more efficient in enhancing the electron efficiency than the other three methods. Finally, the perspective of these enhanced-ZVI technologies was compared in terms of their reactivity, selectivity, chemical cost, and pH adaptability and some suggestions for their possible application were provided.

AB Organic fouling is still elusive in seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination process. Classifying organics in seawater will provide an in-depth understanding of the important fraction on RO fouling. In this study, dissolved organic matter (DOM) in seawater was fractionated and concentrated by membrane technique into three major fractions (i.e., biopolymer fraction, humic substance with building block fraction, and low molecular weight fraction) by their molecular weight (MW) according to the definitions in liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) method. Overall recovery of >80% was attained. The isolated organic fractions were compared with common model foulants such as sodium alginate (SA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and humic acid (HA), in terms of chemical analyses using fluorescence-excitation emission matrix (FEEM) and LC-OCD, as well as their fouling potentials. SWRO fouling experiments were carried out and fouling mechanism was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) method and extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) theory. Results showed that initial fouling (i.e., foulant-membrane interaction) was the main driver in SWRO organic fouling with biopolymer fraction as the major contributor followed by low molecular weight fraction. In addition, divalent ions was found to enhance the RO fouling by increasing the adhesion and cohesion forces between foulant-membrane and foulant-foulant. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) formed by microbial metabolism in wastewater treatment processes adversely impacts wastewater reuse and receiving waters quality, and microbial metabolism is greatly influenced by temperatures. However, little is known about the effect of microorganisms on DON and bioavailable DON (ABDON) formation under low temperatures. In this study, six reactors were operated at low (8 degrees C and 15 degrees C) and room (25 degrees C) temperatures to evaluate the relationship between microbial activity, microbial communities, and DON and ABDON. Results showed that DON and ABDON concentrations significantly increased at low temperatures (p < 0.05, t-test). DON formation was significantly correlated to microbial activity only, with adenosine triphosphate (negative, r = -0.64) and polysaccharide (positive, r = 0.61) as key indicators; however, ABDON formation was influenced by both microbial activity (polysaccharide > triphenyltetrazolium chloride-dehydrogenases > adenosine triphosphate) and microbial community structure. Short-term tests using the biomass from six reactors were performed at room temperature to further validate the relationship. The distinct differences between these results provide a basis for different strategies on reducing effluent DON and ABDON under low temperatures. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB While harvested rainwater can serve as an alternative water supply, microbial contaminants within the collection system can negatively affect water quality. Here, we investigated the impact of roofing material on the microbial quality of rainwater freshly harvested from pilot-scale roofs (concrete tile, cool, green, Galvalume (R) metal, and asphalt fiberglass shingle). The microbial quality of freshly harvested rainwater from six rain events over two years was analyzed by high-throughput sequencing and culture-dependent and -independent techniques. The concentrations of total coliform were significantly different among rainwaters harvested from the various roofing materials (p-value >0.05). However, the fecal coliform concentrations and the copy numbers of Enterococcus 23S rRNA genes and total Bacteria 16S rRNA genes did not vary by type of roofing material in a statistically significant way. Potential human pathogens such as Legionella, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli, and adenovirus were detected at least once in rainwater harvested from the different roofing materials, even though the lowest occurrence of those potential human pathogens was noted from the metal roof. Also, substantial variation in the microbial communities from the different roofing materials was observed at the family and genus levels. These results demonstrate that the type of roofing material affects the microbial quality of freshly harvested rainwater, indicating that the choice of roofing material could shape the microbial community structure entering a rainwater storage tank. Given that detection of potential pathogens in the freshly harvested rainwater also differed between roofing materials, the type of roofing used to capture rainwater needs to be considered in rainwater harvesting system design, particularly if the water is intended for potable use.

Unstable OC (USOC), stable OC (STOC), mineral-protected OC (MOC), and chemically resistant OC (ROC) fractions were fractionated. The chemical structures and microporosity of the ROC fractions were characterized by C-13 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and CO2 adsorption technique, respectively. A first-order, two-compartment kinetics model described the degradation process very well (R-2 > 0.980). The BaP degradation ratios increased with the increasing USOC contents and decreased with the increasing ROC contents. The BaP parent compound in the aqueous solution was almost completely degraded. The considerable portions of oxidized intermediates were detected in different SOC fractions, which represented either oxidized intermediates or parent compounds. The very good multivariate regressions among the degradation kinetics parameters, SOC structures and micropore volumes demonstrated that ROC-bulk, aliphatic moieties, and microporosity played crucial roles in protecting sorbed BaP from being degraded by H2O2. The results showed that ROC, aliphatic moieties, and microporosity played vital roles in Bap degradation process in sediments during H2O2 treatment, which is reported for the first time in this study.

AB As increasing attention is paid to surface water protection, there has been demand for improvements of domestic wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. This has led to the application of many different advanced treatment processes (ATPs). In this study, the treatability of trace organic pollutants in secondary effluent (SE) and associated biotoxicity reduction by four types of ATPs, including coagulation, granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption, ultraviolet (UV) photolysis and photocatalysis, and ozonation, were investigated at the bench-scale. The ATPs showed different removal capacity for the 48 chemicals, which were classified into seven categories. EDCs, herbicides, bactericides and pharmaceuticals were readily degraded, and insecticides, flame retardants, and UV filters were relatively resistant to removal. During these processes, the efficiency of the ATPs in reducing four biological effects were investigated. Of the four biological effects, the estrogenic activity from SE was not detected using the yeast estrogen screen. In contrast with genotoxicity and photosynthesis inhibition, bacterial cytotoxicity posed by SE was the most difficult biological effect to reduce with these ATPs. GAC adsorption and ozonation were the most robust treatment processes for reducing the three detected biotoxicities. UV photolysis and photocatalysis showed comparable efficiencies for the reduction of genotoxicity and photosynthesis inhibition. However, coagulation only performed well in genotoxicity reduction. The effect-based trigger values for the four bioassays, that were derived from the existing environmental quality standards and from HC5 (hazardous concentration for 5% of aquatic organisms), were all used to select and optimize these ATPs for ecological safety. Conducting ATPs in more appropriate ways could eliminate the negative effects of WWTP effluent on receiving water bodies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A large portion of the toxic effects observed in surface waters cannot be attributed to compounds regularly measured by water authorities. Hence, there is an urgent need for an effect-based monitoring strategy that employs bioassays to identify environmental risks. The aim of the present study was to perform an effect-based nationwide water quality assessment to identify ecotoxicological risks in a wide variety of surface waters. At 45 locations silicone rubbers and polar organic chemical integrative samplers were exposed to surface water for 6 weeks. Alongside the passive samplers an in-situ daphnid test was performed. Subsequent to field exposure, accumulated compounds were extracted from the passive samplers after which a battery of in vivo and in vitro bioassays was exposed to the extracts. The bioassay battery was selected such that it could identify the risks posed by a wide range of chemical pollutants and their transformation products, while simultaneously allowing for targeted identification of groups of compounds that cause specific effects. Bioassay responses were compared to effect-based trigger values to identify potential ecotoxicological risks at the investigated locations. Responses were observed in all bioassays, and trigger values were exceeded in 9 out of the 21 applied assays, allowing for ranking of the investigated locations based on ecotoxicological risks. No relationship between land use and the identification of ecotoxicological risks was observed. Based on the results, considerations regarding future improvements of effect-based monitoring are given. It is concluded that effect-based water quality assessment allowed prioritization of sites based on ecotoxicological risks, identified the presence of hazardous compounds regardless of being listed as priority substances, and meanwhile could prevent costly chemical analysis at sites with low ecotoxicological risks.

AB The abilities of three phylogenetically distant ammonia oxidizers, Nitrososphaera gargensis, an ammonia oxidizing archaeon (AOA); Nitrosomomas nitrosa Nm90, an ammonia-oxidizing bacterium (AOB); and Nitrospira inopinata, the only complete ammonia oxidizer (comammox) available as a pure culture, to biotransform seven sulfonamides (SAs) were investigated. The removals and protein-normalized biotransformation rate constants indicated that the AOA strain N. gargensis exhibited the highest SA biotransformation rates, followed by N. inopinata and N. nitrosa Nm90. The transformation products (TPs) of sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfamethazine (SMZ) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and the biotransformation mechanisms were evaluated. Based on the analysis of the TP formulas and approximate structures, it was found that during biotransformation, i) the AOA strain carried out SA deamination, hydroxylation, and nitration; ii) the AOB strain mainly performed SA deamination; and iii) the comammox isolate participated only in deamination reactions. It is proposed that deamination was catalyzed by deaminases while hydroxylation and nitration were mediated by nonspecific activities of the ammonia monooxygenase (AMO). Additionally, it was demonstrated that among the three ammonia oxidizers, only AOB contributed to the formation of pterin-SA conjugates. The biotransformation of SDZ, SMZ and SMX occurred only when ammonia oxidation was active, suggesting a cometabolic transformation mechanism. Interestingly, SAs could also be transformed by hydroxylamine, an intermediate of ammonia oxidation, suggesting that in addition to enzymatic conversions, a microbially induced abiotic mechanism contributes to SA transformation during ammonia oxidation. Overall, using experiments with pure cultures, this study provides important insights into the roles played by ammonia oxidizers in SA biotransformation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aqueous aggregation kinetics of manganese oxides, the solid products formed during water treatment and subsurface remediation with permanganate, are crucial for its application. In this study, manganese oxides nanoparticles were in situ formed in a permanganate/(bi)sulfite system, which was found to have excellent oxidation ability. Aggregation kinetics of such manganese oxides (i.e., MnOx-1.5, MnOx-2.5 and MnOx-5; the number represents the molar ratio of (bi)sulfite to permanganate) were evaluated by employing time-resolved dynamic light scattering under various aquatic conditions. In NaNO3 solution, the stability of manganese oxides decreased in the order of MnOx-1.5 > MnOx-2.5 > MnOx-5, indicated by their critical coagulation concentrations (CCCs). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and zeta potential measurements indicated that Mn-II/III were responsible for the decreased stability due to their charge neutralization effects. However, in Ca(NO3)(2) solution, three manganese oxides had similar CCCs, probably due to the relatively great charge neutralization ability of Ca2+. Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA), through electrosteric interaction, suppressed the aggregation of MnOx-1.5 in Ca(NO3)(2) solution, but had no such effect in NaNO3 solution. Comparatively, the stability of MnOx-5 was markedly enhanced with SRFA in NaNO3 solutions. It was proposed that Ca2+ and Mn-II/III could increase the adsorption of SRFA through charge neutralization and cation bridging. This study highlights the dual role, dependent on either presence or absence of SRFA, of Ca2+ and Mn-II/III in controlling the aggregation of manganese oxides nanoparticles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cooling towers for heating, ventilation and air conditioning are ubiquitous in the built environment. Often located on rooftops, their semi-open water basins provide a suitable environment for microbial growth. They are recognized as a potential source of bacterial pathogens and have been associated with disease outbreaks such as Legionnaires' disease. While measures to minimize public health risks are in place, the general microbial and protist community structure and dynamics in these systems remain largely elusive. In this study, we analysed the microbiome of the bulk water from the basins of three cooling towers by 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing over the course of one year. Bacterial diversity in all three towers was broadly comparable to other freshwater systems, yet less diverse than natural environments; the most abundant taxa are also frequently found in freshwater or drinking water. While each cooling tower had a pronounced site-specific microbial community, taxa shared among all locations mainly included groups generally associated with biofilm formation. We also detected several groups related to known opportunistic pathogens, such as Legionella, Mycobacterium, and Pseudomonas species, albeit at generally low abundance. Although cooling towers represent a rather stable environment, microbial community composition was highly dynamic and subject to seasonal change. Protists are important members of the cooling tower water microbiome and known reservoirs for bacterial pathogens. Co-occurrence analysis of bacteria and protist taxa successfully captured known interactions between amoeba-associated bacteria and their hosts, and predicted a large number of additional relationships involving ciliates and other protists. Together, this study provides an unbiased and comprehensive overview of microbial diversity of cooling tower water basins, establishing a framework for investigating and assessing public health risks associated with these man-made freshwater environments.

AB To understand the effects of large-scale sediment compaction on iodine enrichment in the groundwater system of the North China Plain (NCP), hydrogeochemical and isotope (H-2, O-18 and Sr-87/Sr-86) geochemical features of groundwater, seawater and pore water of the deep aquifer sediments were characterized. Groundwater iodine concentration ranged from 5.8 to 1110 mu g/I, and approximately 80% of groundwater samples have iodine concentration more than 100 mu g/L. High iodine groundwater (>100 mu g/L) is mainly distributed in the Bohai bay area where serious land subsidence occurs. The sediments deposited during several events of marine transgression are considered as the main source of groundwater iodine. The pore solution compacted from the clayey sediments has a iodine concentration up to 830 mu g/L, indicating that marine source iodine was stored in the clayey layers. The hydrogen and oxygen isotope signatures of groundwater show that the groundwater from NCP is mainly recharged by precipitation and the pore water from sediment compaction due to intense land subsidence. The Cl/Br molar ratio and Sr-87/Sr-86 signatures of groundwater and sediment pore water further suggest the effects of mixing with compaction-released pore solution on the hydrochemical evolution of high iodine groundwater. Based on groundwater delta H-2, Cl concentration and Sr-87/Sr-86, the results of two end-members mixing model calculation indicate that the compaction-released pore solution contributes approximately 49.1-68.9% iodine to high iodine groundwater, and the iodine from compaction-released pore solution ranges between 407 and 572 mu g/L. The results of this study therefore suggest that the compaction of clayey sediments can be a major hydrogeological process controlling the genesis of high iodine groundwater in deep aquifers at NCP.

AB A novel approach for harvesting Scenedesmus sp. microalgae from real wastewater by using adsorbents of magnetite-based nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) was tested in this study for the first time for this microalgae. Using these NPs, the harvesting efficiency was even higher than 95%. The optimal conditions (0.14 gNPs/L, a short magnetic separation time of only 8 min and 27 min of contact time) were found using the response surface methodology. The best fitting of the adsorption equilibrium results was achieved by the Langmuir isotherm model, and the maximum adsorption capacity for Scenedesmus sp. reached 3.49 g dry cell weight (DCW)/g Fe3O4 NPs. Zeta potential measurements and the Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm model analysis pointed out that the main adsorption mechanism between Scenedesmus sp. cells and Fe3O4 NPs was electrostatic interaction. Finally, Fe3O4 NPs were six times successfully reused by combining an alkaline treatment with an ultrasonication process, which implies microalgae lysis. The results herein obtained highlight the potential for magnetic separation of microalgae from wastewater, which is capable of reaching a high harvesting efficiency in a very short time, (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In electromembrane desalination processes such as electrodialysis (ED) and ion concentration polarization (ICP) desalination, ion-depleted boundary layers constitute the desalted, product stream, yet also cause high resistivity and voltage drop. Directly manipulating fluid flow streams is a new method to break this fundamental trade-off for electromembrane desalination. In this work, we are introducing a novel electromembrane desalination architecture that allows a feed stream to return to the feed inlet side of the membrane (hereby named as return-flow (RF) architecture) to improve the energy efficiency by re-distributing and controlling the depleted boundary layer, even at high current values. The technical feasibility of this idea was examined in ICP desalination process (RF-ICP) with a wide range of feed salinity from 10 to 70 g/L. For a partial desalination, RF-ICP (similar to 75 cm(2) of membrane area) has achieved similar power consumption compared to batch-ED with 3 times bigger membrane area (200 cm(2)) with a higher area efficiency for salt removal, which translates into lower optimal desalination cost. The techno-economic analysis of RF-ICP have been performed for the treatment of 70 g/L brine waste. For partial desalination of 70 brine down to 35 g/L, RF-ICP desalination achieved overall water cost as low as $2.57/m(3) ($0.41/barrel). This could translate into reduction in total water cost up to 31% for zero brine release scenarios, depending on the concentrated brine treatment cost. These results show that return flow architecture can improve the performance of electromembrane desalination, enabling more flexible water treatment for many real-world applications.

AB Pharmaceutical wastewater often contains high levels of antibiotic residues and serves as an important reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, the current pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (PWWTPs) were not sufficiently effective in removing antibiotics and ARGs. Here, we designed a lab-scale simulation reactor, including up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB), anoxic-oxic tank (A/O), and four separate advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) i.e., UV, Ozonation, Fenton, and Fenton/UV, to simultaneously remove 18 antibiotics and 10 ARGs from a real pharmaceutical wastewater. The results showed that all antibiotics were fully eliminated through the reactor during 180 d-operation. Among all treatment units, UASB provided the greatest contribution (85.8 +/- 16.1%) for the removal of 18 antibiotics. The mass balance results manifested that degradation was a predominant mechanism for the removal of tetracyclines, sulfamethoxazole, and ampicillin (62.5-80.9%), while sorption to sludge (73.9%) was predominant for enrofloxacin removal in UASB. Meanwhile, the substantial decrease of ARG absolute abundance (log reduction by 0.1-3.1 fold) through the whole reactor was observed although the existence of the partial enrichment (1.2-3.8 log units) from the influent to the A/O unit. Fenton/UV combination was the most effective AOP for the removal of ARGs. Finally, the optimum operating conditions for the removal of ARGs using Fenton was also proposed considering the relatively lower cost and high ARG elimination. Overall, this study provides feasible suggestions for the design of real PWWTPs for simultaneous removal of antibiotics and ARGs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The intermittent nature of stormwater runoff impacts the treatment performance of biofilters, also known as stormwater biofiltration or bioretention systems and raingardens. During extended dry periods, which are common even in temperate climates, plants can perish, creating unattractive and nonfunctional systems that might leach pollutants during the next rainfall event. The current solution is to irrigate during long dry spells, which is costly and unsustainable as biofilters become more widespread. This paper presents the development of dual-mode biofilters, where stormwater and greywater are treated within the same system. Fifty columns, utilising eight plant species, including understory and climbing ornamentals, and designs with and without a carbon source in the submerged zone, were subjected to alternating greywater and stormwater inflows over five months. Six sampling events investigated treatment performance across these switching inflows and an extended dry period (atypical event). Good removal of total suspended solids (>83%), biochemical oxygen demand (>86%) and some heavy metals (e.g. lead >96%) were reported irrespective of design. Plant species selection was critical for the removal of nitrogen (2 to 79%) and phosphorus (12 to 75%) under dual-mode operation. However, following the extended dry period, plants with the lowest nutrient outflow concentrations also experienced some of the highest sediment and carbon concentrations, suggesting that a mixture of plant species may be beneficial for withstanding abnormal conditions. Differences between the treatment performance of designs with and without a carbon source were negligible, with potential benefits possibly negated due to the increased root mass that comes with age (systems were approximately two years old) and the release of carbon from root exudates. The results demonstrate the potential for dual mode stormwater-greywater biofilters as an alternative to single-mode systems as they can provide effective treatment, along with greater volumes of treated water, while maintaining system performance throughout the year.

AB Thermal management of photovoltaic cells is an essential research objective for increasing the conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic. Flat plate heat pipe is a passive cooling device capable of effectively reducing the solar cell temperature. Therefore, this study presents a numerical investigation of a hybrid photovoltaic-thermoelectric system with and without a flat plate heat pipe. A detailed comparative analysis of the electrical performance of the photovoltaic only, photovoltaic-thermoelectric and photovoltaic-thermoelectric-heat pipe systems is performed. The influence of solar concentration ratio, ambient temperature, wind speed and thermoelectric generator cold side temperature on the efficiency and power output of the photovoltaic only and hybrid photovoltaic-thermoelectric systems are studied using COMSOL 5.4 Multiphysics software. A three-dimensional finite element study is carried out and temperature dependent thermoelectric material properties are considered to increase the simulation accuracy. Results show that the photovoltaic-thermoelectric-heat pipe efficiency is 1.47% and 61.01% higher compared to that of the photovoltaic-thermoelectric and photovoltaic only systems respectively at a concentration ratio of 6. In addition, the photovoltaic-thermoelectric-heat pipe is recommended for highly concentrated systems because of its superior performance. Furthermore, the photovoltaic-thermoelectric system is a better alternative to the photovoltaic only system because of its enhanced performance which is second only to that of the photovoltaic-thermoelectric-heat pipe system. Results also show that ineffective cooling of the thermoelectric generator can adversely affect the performance of the hybrid systems. This study will proper valuable information on the feasibility of hybrid photovoltaic-thermoelectric systems with and without heat pipe. Finally, the three-dimensional nature of this study makes it very useful in understanding the actual temperature distribution in the hybrid systems.

AB This paper reports on an algorithm for hourly simulation of ground-coupled heat pump (GCHP) systems. This algorithm integrates the newest analytical models for COP of heat pumps and for heat transfer of ground heat exchangers (GHEs). These analytical models make the algorithm computationally fast and efficient. The algorithm comprises 7 independent equations for solving 7 system variables, thus including C-14(7) = 3432 simulation scenarios. The algorithm is applied to hourly 50-year simulations of a GCHP for illustrating the computation efficiency of the algorithm. The simulation cases show that the COP and seasonal COP of GCHPs depend heavily on the mutual-cause coupling between the ground-side load and the temperature field in the ground. This coupling effect renders the high-resolution simulation highly necessary.

AB The effectiveness and accuracy of the methods used in modeling photovoltaic (PV) cells are necessary for predicting the performance of PV systems. This article presents and analyses four methods used to estimate the unknown parameters of photovoltaic devices for one- (four and five parameters) and two-diode (seven parameters) models. The study has three main objectives: (i) extract the unknown parameters by the four methods for the 28 modules of different PV technologies (mono-crystalline, multi-crystalline, HIT, and amorphous) and manufacturers under standard test conditions, (ii) verify the effectiveness and the accuracy of the methods, at each current-voltage curve data point (category 1), and the error relative at each short-circuit current (I-sc), open circuit voltage (V-oc) and peak power (P-p) points (category 2) and (iii) study the accuracy and reliability of the four methods for the energy measurement of a PV plant of 1.75 kW over three days installed in desert environment. The results show that the most accurate method is obtained by the four parameters one-diode model. It was shown that there is a good agreement with all important points of the I-V curves; especially at I-sc, V-oc and P-p points, and with the energy delivered by the PV system in the three days.

AB Packed bed reactors have been widely used in chemical reaction engineering. A kind of grille-sphere composite packed bed has been proposed to decrease the pressure drop and increase the radial heat transfer performance. In the present paper, both the homogeneous model and the solid particle method are used to study methane steam reforming reactions in a grille-sphere composite packed bed. Firstly, the homogeneous model is adopted to compare the overall chemical reaction performance between the randomly packed bed and the grille-sphere composite packed bed. In the homogeneous model, the packed bed is considered as a porous media and the kinetic reaction rates are incorporated into Fluent software with user-defined functions. Secondly, an optimization is conducted by using the solid particle method for packing structure in the single channel of the grille sphere composite packed bed with sub-channel to particle diameter ratios between 1.00 and 2.00. In the solid particle method, both fluid and solid domains are included. User-defined scalars are used to represent species inside catalytic particles and the chemical reactions are modeled with user-defined functions. It is found that when compared with the randomly packed bed, the conversion rate of methane in the grille-sphere composite packed bed is increased from 9.58% to 12.30% and the temperature of the tube wall is lowered by 50 K, indicating a longer tube life. Moreover, in the grille-sphere composite packed bed, with the proper selection of sub channel to particle diameter ratio and the packing form, the pressure drop is greatly reduced and the heat of the chemical reaction is improved. When sub-channel to particle diameter ratio is less than 1.71, the main stream is not disturbed by particles, which results in lower pressure drop and higher overall thermal storage performance.

AB An environmental life cycle assessment of a pilot scale microbial electrolysis cell for hydrogen production was performed for the first time in this study. The microbial electrolysis cell system was designed based on the existing pilot plants with urban wastewater flow rate of 65 L.d (-1) at wastewater strength of 500 mg COD.L-1. The effect of the performance parameters of the microbial electrolysis cell on life cycle results was analyzed with SimaPro 8.2.3.0. The results showed that the emissions per kg hydrogen-produced from construction phase are the greatest among all phases of the current microbial electrolysis cell system. An increase in cathodic gas recovery and hydrogen production rate resulted in a decrease in emissions per kg hydrogen-produced from the operation and construction of the microbial electrolysis cell. In addition, the total life cycle emissions decreased with increasing of the cathodic gas recovery and electricity transformation efficiency, and increase with increasing applied voltage. The global warming potential from the operation phase was 18.8 kg carbon dioxide-eq/ kg hydrogen under the following conditions: applied voltage of 0.5 V, electricity transformation efficiency of 90%, and cathodic gas recovery of 90%. Compared with existing hydrogen production and wastewater treatment technologies, the current microbial electrolysis cell technology for hydrogen production from wastewater can still be improved in terms of environmental benefits and technical maturity. Nevertheless, microbial electrolysis cell technology with optimized operation parameters will hopefully become an important choice of hydrogen production and wastewater treatment technology in the future.

AB In addition to generate electricity, solid oxide fuel cells also produce a considerable quantity of high-quality waste heat. To harvest the waste heat, an advanced triple-cycle system based upon solid oxide fuel cells, vacuum thermionic generators and absorption refrigerators is theoretically put forward. Assuming that the main irreversible losses within the system are thermodynamic and electrochemical losses, the performance parameters mathematically evaluating the whole system are specified under different operating conditions. The effectiveness is also demonstrated through performance comparisons between the proposed system and the stand-alone solid oxide fuel cell system. Numerical calculations show that the maximum attainable power density and its corresponding efficiency allow 20.3% and 18.4% larger than that of the stand-alone solid oxide fuel cell system, respectively. Comprehensive parametric studies are further undertaken to reveal the influences of some decisive design parameters and operating conditions on the triple-cycle system performance. Results show that the microstructure parameters of the solid oxide fuel cell and the anode temperature of the vacuum thermionic generator can be optimally designed to maximize the power density of the triple-cycle system. The vacuum thermionic generator can be treated as the alternative intermediate cycle for SOFC based triple-cycle systems.

AB This study analyzes the energy sustainability of citrus residues conversion and valorization through fluidized bed gasification plant. An energy analysis of the integration into a real citrus juice factory of a combined heat and power system (CHP), coupled with a citrus residues air-steam gasification unit, is presented. Energy and biomass assessments are estimated by matching the gasification unit performance with the syngas request of the CHP unit through an integrated simulation model.
   Results show that the integration of a gasification-CHP system into the juice industrial cycle could supply 7,875 MWh/year of electricity, corresponding to 88% of the factory's demand. About 82% of the heat produced in the CHP unit is used to dry the citrus residues, while about 1,086 MWh/year are available for the heat request of the juice production process. This allow saving 27,906 MWh/year of non-renewable primary energy, reducing the specific non-renewable primary energy consumption of about 46% the factory's carbon dioxide impact could be decreased of about 45%.

AB A large-scale renewable photovoltaic-wind-concentrating solar power hybrid system integrating an electric heating device is proposed to provide a sustainable power for a domestic region. The thermal energy storage and the electric heating device can be utilized to recover the power rejection from the photovoltaic and wind systems, and match the flexible load demand. In this research, a dynamic physical model is established to analyze the dynamic output characteristics based on the renewable resources and load demand in Zhangbei area, China. The results prove that the hybrid system can well match the load demand most of the time, and the power rejection can be recovered by about 20-35%. The Levelized Cost of Energy achieves its lowest level at the fixed capacities of photovoltaic and wind systems. Further, the recovery ratio is inversely proportional to the solar multiple and the capacities of the photovoltaic and wind systems, while it improves with the increase of the thermal energy storage capacity. The Levelized Cost of Energy of 0.2775 $/kWh and the recovery ratio of 30.87% are achieved when the hybrid system is composed of 900 MWe photovoltaic, 3600 MWe wind, and 1360 MWe concentrating solar power system at the solar multiple of 1.2 and the thermal energy storage capacity of 190 GWht, given the loss of power supply probability of 5%.

AB Printed circuit heat exchangers are considered as one of the most promising candidates for the supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle due to its high pressure resistance and high compactness. It is a critical component to exchange the heat between the primary loop and the secondary loop, which directly relates to the overall efficiency of the Brayton cycle. This work investigates the effect of supercritical carbon dioxide side inlet temperature and pressure on the overall heat transfer performance of a printed circuit heat exchanger with zigzag fins. A new evaluation method with working point is proposed to estimate the overall heat transfer performance, which considers the effects of working temperature and pressure. The results show that the overall heat transfer coefficient increases with the increase of mass flow rate and operating pressure, but performs the opposite changes with the increase of inlet temperature. A printed circuit heat exchanger will get better performance when the working point is closer to 1. This evaluation method is further validated under different operating conditions with available data from the open literature. The results show that the overall heat transfer coefficient peaks when the working point is closer to 1 for a double pipe heat exchanger.

AB A novel method was developed to detect the optimal onshore wind farm layout driven by the characteristics of all commercially-available wind turbines. A huge number of turbine combinations (577) was processed, resulting in 22,721 generated layouts. Various assumptions and constraints were considered, mostly derived from the literature, including site features, wind conditions, and layout design. For the latter, an irregularly staggered turbine array configuration was assumed. Wake effects were simulated through the Jensen's model, while a typical turbine thrust coefficient curve as a function of wind speed was originally developed. A detailed cost model was used, with levelized cost of energy selected as primary and capacity factor as secondary objective function. The self-organizing maps were used to address a thorough analysis, proving to be a powerful means to straightforwardly achieve a comprehensive pattern of wind farm layout optimization.
   In general, the two optimization functions basically match, while for higher wind potential sites, increasing capacity factor did not necessarily result in decreasing levelized cost of energy. The latter may be minimised by reducing the total number of turbines or the overall wind farm capacity, as well as maximising rotor diameters or minimising rated wind speeds; increasing rated power or hub height is only beneficial for mid-potential sites. The mere maximisation of wind farm energy production is a misleading target, as corresponding to mid-to-high values of levelized cost of energy. In contrast to previous studies, the use of turbines with different rated power, rotor diameter or hub height should be avoided.

AB This paper presents the thermo-hydraulic performance analysis of the printed circuit heat exchangers (PCHEs) with new channel geometries. A new channel geometry for the PCHEs) has been proposed based on a staggered arrangement of sinusoidal fins. Initially, thermal and hydraulic performance of the proposed channel geometry was computed numerically and was compared with the performance of the conventional zigzag channel geometry using supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO(2)) as a working fluid. Later, the suggested geometry was optimized using response surface methodology in combination with the genetic algorithm. Lastly, thermal and hydraulic performance of the optimized channel geometry was computed numerically along with the zigzag channel geometry for a wide range of Reynolds number based on which heat transfer and pressure drop correlations were proposed. Computed results show that hydraulic performance of the optimized proposed channel geometry is up to 2.5 times better in comparison with the conventional zigzag channel geometry with identical thermal characteristics. Moreover, the overall performance of the optimized proposed channel geometry was found up to 21% and 16% higher for the cold and hot side, respectively.

AB As an appropriate hydrogen supply system for high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, steam reforming of methanol (SRM) is proposed because reformate gas including low quality H-2 with some impurities can be directly used as the fuel. In this study, we compare two SRM systems with and without the use of tail gas from pressure swing adsorption and comprehensive economic analysis is performed for the SRM process with the use of tail gas to estimate a unit H-2 production cost (C-UHP) based on historical data of natural gas and the CO2 allowance prices for Korea, Europe, Western Climate Initiative (WCI), and Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). From deterministic economic analysis with a H-2 production capacity of 700 m(3)h(-1), the C-UHP values are 6.88 $ kgH(2)(-1) for Korea, 6.84 $ kgH(2)(-1) for Europe, 6.50 $ kgH(2)(-1) for WCI, and 6.54 $ kgH(2)(-1) for RGGI, respectively. Furthermore, additional two scenarios, pessimistic and optimistic ones (Scenario 1 and 2, respectively), are investigated to evaluate the current level of CuHp values for H-2 production capacities from 30 to 700 m(3)h(-1). With a Monte-Carlo simulation method, stochastic economic analysis is carried out to predict the ranges of potential C-UHP, values for each region. The C-UHP values for WCI and RGGI show the narrow distributions meaning lower change of C-UHP; however, a wide range of distribution for Korea and Europe suggest that there is considerably higher variation, demonstrating the necessity of stochastic uncertainty analysis when assessing the economic feasibility.

AB Compared with the diesel engine with variable nozzle turbocharger, the performance and economy characteristics of diesel engine without variable nozzle turbocharger are experimentally investigated under various operating conditions in this paper. The diesel engine with variable nozzle turbocharger is employed to evaluate the effects of the opening degree on supercharging pressure, air flow, brake specific fuel consumption, smoke intensity and exhaust temperature of diesel engine. And the external and universal characteristics of diesel engines are also studied. The result shows that the variable nozzle turbocharger is beneficial to improve the performance and economy characteristics of diesel engine at the speed range of 900-1300 r/min. The experiments were carried out on the urban bus in Hezhou Road located in Guangxi Province (China) with engine of the YC6J200-42 series. The variable nozzle turbocharger can significantly optimize the performance and economy characteristics of whole vehicle, especially at low and medium speeds with lower smoke and nitrogen oxide emissions. Owing to the research data, the opening degree of variable nozzle turbocharger should be adjusted as much as possible to reduce the exhaust back pressure and pumping loss to improve the fuel economy of the engine.

AB The main objective of the proposed article is the establishment of rules and tools for energy management optimization as well as the sizing of an autonomous wind and solar production system using an electrochemical storage device. The optimization criterion is techno-economic in order to minimize the energy produced cost, while considering the reliability level required by the consumer. Four most recent nature inspired algorithms have been employed to solve this complex optimization problem. This included ant lion optimizer algorithm (ALO), grey wolf optimizer algorithm (GWO), krill herd algorithm (KH) and JAYA algorithm, which is used for the first time in renewable systems sizing. Thus, the conducted methodology permits to determine the optimal system configuration, by minimizing the unit electricity cost (UEC) for a specified loss of power supply probability (LPSP) while counting the excess energy. Three electrochemical battery technologies including, lead-Acid (LA), lithium-ion (Li-ion) and Nickel-Cadmium (Ni-Cd) have been considered in this study. In order to predict the future performance of the studied system, various sensitivity analyzes have been carried out taking into account, the impact of the lifetime, the depth of discharge (DOD) and the relative cost of divers battery technologies on the UEC. The simulation results demonstrate the supremacy of the JAYA algorithm against the other algorithms. JAYA converges towards the optimal solutions for three battery technologies. It also shows that a 50% reduction in battery cost will reduce the cost of EUC by 30%, which would allow Li-ion batteries to become as competitive as LA batteries in terms of cost. Other similarly interesting results on the effect of DOD on UEC have been found. For DODs of 50% and 80% corresponding respectively, to Ni-Cd and Li-ion technologies, the UEC produced by the PV/Wind/Ni-Cd and PV/Wind/Li-ion systems becomes as attractive as that produced by the PV/Wind/LA system.

AB Mesoporous bioactive glasses (MBGs) are considered to be outstanding bone-repairing materials. MBGs were prepared by a two-step acid-catalyzed self-assembly (TSACSA) process combined with a hydrothermal reaction. To synthesize the optimized texture organization, an orthogonal experiment was designed under the same conditions (acid concentration, calcination temperature, hydrothermal time and hydrothermal temperature). The MBGs were characterized by N-2 adsorption analysis, SAXS and TEM. The in vitro bioactivity was investigated by XRD and FTIR after soaking in SBF for 3 and 6 h. The results illustrated that the calcination temperature was the key factor affecting pore volume and the specific surface area. The hydrothermal temperature had the greatest impact on pore size. Compared with MBG prior to hydrothermal treatment, MBG after hydrothermal treatment displays more highly ordered mesopores and more uniform cylindrical pores. In the in vitro bioactivity test, synthesized MBG presents hydroxyapatite (HA) mineralization activity within a short time. The optimal conditions of the synthetic process were 1 mol hydrochloride acid, a hydrothermal reaction temperature of 120 degrees C for 24 h and a calcination temperature of 500 degrees C. This resulted in a large pore volume (1.22 +/- 0.06 cm(3) g(-1)) and high specific surface (679 +/- 32 m(2) g(-1)).

AB Exploring the materials with distinct optical properties is still in progress. Hence, Co-doped lithium borosilicate glasses of composition x Li2O-(80 - x) B2O3-19.6 SiO2-0.4 CoO (x = 5, 10, 15 and 20 mol%) were synthesized via communal melt quenching method. XRD affirmed the amorphous essence of such glasses. Local structure of such glasses was explored via FTIR spectroscopy. Simultaneously, the BO4 structural units in such glasses decreased with Li2O additions, rendering the open structure. Additionally, the density of such glasses decreased by Li2O addition, consequently, causing an open structure. The systematic substitution of B2O3 by Li2O affected the optical basicity and electronic polarizability of such glasses, causing the increase of NBOs ratio and ionic nature of such glasses. Interestingly, the optical transitions of Co-ions embedded in lithium borosilicate glass system were investigated. The optical band gaps provided lower values together with evident augmentation of band tails with Li(2)Oaddition. The processes of deconvolution and focusing of optical spectra were implemented on the characteristic bands of cobalt to obtain more visions into the crystal field interaction and d-levels splitting. The consequence of such processes revealed obvious reductions in the ligand field strength upon Li2O addition, leading to reduce d-levels splitting. Moreover, the metallization criterion values were changed from 0.41 to 0.37, rendering a semiconducting character to such glasses. Given the Co3+/Co2+ optical transitions in both visible and NIR spectral regions and their possible tunability through Li2O additives, such glasses are significantly useful for the development of optically active materials besides offering the prospect applications in various optical devices.

AB High alumina high-level waste (HLW) is stored at the Hanford Site. This waste will be vitrified into borosilicate glasses at the Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP). The efficiency of the WTP operation will be strongly influenced by the loading of high Al2O3 wastes in HLW glass and the melter processing rate. A study was performed to formulate glasses with high loading of Al2O3-rich HLW and demonstrate their processability. Glasses with Al2O3 concentrations ranging from 30 to 35 mass% were designed and tested. One example glass with Al2O3 loading of 34 mass% was processed in a small-scale continuous melter. These compositions showed promising properties and good processability, suggesting that loading Hanford HLW glasses with excess of 30 mass% Al2O3 can be successfully produced at the WTP. The ability of existing glass property composition models to predict the properties of HLW glasses with high Al2O3 content was evaluated. Viscosity and electrical conductivity model predictions appeared reasonably close to measured values, while crystallization and product consistency test model predictions were found to be significantly different from measured values.

AB Based on the chemical and mineral composition of asbestos tailings, the asbestos tailings powder was pre-fired, formed into green body and finally heat-treated to prepare glass-ceramics through the processes of crystallization and sintering. The main crystal phases of the sample were forsterite and enstatite, and the minor crystal phases were magnesioferrite and diopside. The effects of crystallization temperature (787-867 degrees C) and sintering temperature (1150-1250 degrees C) on crystallization and phase change, micromorphology and physical-chemical properties of glass ceramics were investigated by means of thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry analysis (TG-DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDS) and mechanical properties tests. The results showed that the toxic phase chrysotile was almost converted into forsterite when the asbestos tailings powder was pre-fired at 700 degrees C for 1 h. During the sintering process of the green body, with the increase in the crystallization temperature, the content of the forsterite firstly increased and then decreased, and the enstatite increased gradually. After crystallizing at 850 degrees C for 1 h and holding at different sintering temperatures for 1 h, the glass-ceramics samples were obtained. With the increase in sintering temperature, the content of diopside in the samples gradually decreased, the hematite gradually disappeared and magnesioferrite precipitated at the same time. The crystal morphology was transformed from aggregates of spherulites and ellipse into intertwined bodies of spherulites, ellipse and round bar-like shape. The glass-ceramics achieved optimum compactness at the sintering temperature of 1200 degrees C with the water absorption rate being 0.026%, the bulk density being 3.164 g/cm(3), and the flexural strength being 88 MPa, which reached the standard of glass ceramics for construction. In the process of preparing glass-ceramics from asbestos tailings, the phase transition and detoxification in asbestos tailings were realized, which had certain practical value for the utilization of asbestos tailings and the preparation of high value-added materials.

AB Seven 1.1-1.4-mu m-thick hydrogen-free amorphous-silicon (a-Si) thin films were deposited at high rates (larger than 10 angstrom/s), by rf magnetron sputtering (RFMS) onto room-temperature glass substrates. The influence of argon-gas pressure on the structural and optical properties of these amorphous films has been systematically studied. We have used the Wemple-DiDomenico (WD) single-effective-oscillator model, n(2)((h) over bar omega) 1 = EdE0/(E-0(2) - ((h) over bar)omega)(2)), in order to determine the WD parameters oscillator strength or dispersion energy, E-d, and oscillator energy, E-0. The amorphous-to-crystalline mass-density ratio, p(alpha)/rho(x), in the empirical expression for E-d, proposed by Wemple, is the key factor in understanding the refractive-index behaviour of the RFMS-a-Si thin films. The value of the static refractive index, n(0), which is related to both the atomic structure and mass density, remains approximately constant up to a threshold Ar-gas pressure of nearly 1 Pa, and then it starts dropping rather abruptly. The decrease found in the Urbach energy, E-U, as well as the increase observed in the Tauc gap and slope, E-g and B respectively, for Ar-gas pressures higher than the voided-structure threshold sputtering pressure, clearly suggests that the amount of intermediate-range order present within the RFMS-a-Si layers under study, is increasing in direct response to the increase in the Ar-gas pressure, during the deposition process. This is independently corroborated by the decreasing values of the Raman-intensity ratio, I-TA/I-TO, as the sputtering pressure increases, in the case of high Ar pressure a-Si films.

AB A viscoelastic study of the 25GeS(2)-55SbS(3/2)-20SnS and 12.5GaS(3/2)-75SbS(3/2)-12.5SnS sulfide glasses was carried out around their deformation temperatures using a uniaxial compression creep test. Their viscosities showed similar temperature dependences, but slightly lower sensitivity was observed for the latter glass than for the former glass, which may be explained by the theory of free volume. The creep function, derived from the displacement of the height of the sample subjected to a creep test, was converted into relaxation moduli by performing a Laplace transformation and its inversion. The shear relaxation moduli G(t) revealed two distinct structural relaxation processes, specifically with short and long relaxation times. Both the major fast-relaxation process and minor slow-relaxation process obeyed the time temperature superposition principle. The fast-relaxation activation energies for both glasses were estimated to be about 390 kJ/mol. This value was close to the dissociation energy of the Sb-S bond, which formed the major cross-links of the glass network. In contrast, slow-relaxation activation energies of approximately 590 and 550 kJ/mol were determined for the GeS2-containing and GaS3/2-containing glasses, respectively. The slow-relaxation process, having a higher activation energy for the GeS2-containing glass than for the GaS3/2-containing glass, was concluded to have involved dissociation and recombination, even at high temperatures, of the stronger crosslinks made of the Ge-S and Ga-S bonds in the glass network.

AB Silver-containing glasses are promising candidates for photonic applications, due to the potentiality of spectroscopic properties of silver nanoclusters (NC's) and/or silver metallic nanoparticles. In this framework, silver containing fluorophosphate glasses are candidates with a strong potential. Indeed, combined with femtosecond laser irradiation, silver NC's may be tailored in three-dimensional fluorescent micro-structures, whose spectroscopic properties have been investigated, revealing the creation of silver NC's but also of NP's during laser irradiation in the studied fluorophosphate glass. Additionally, the photo-inscription of silver NC's is correlatively accompanied by a positive index change, which has led to the demonstration of optical waveguiding behavior. Finally, the management of the reservoir of available silvers for laser inscription is investigated. Unlike previous observations made in standard oxide phosphate glasses, the considered silver-containing fluorophosphate glass exhibes an intriguing ability to be re-written when subjected to successive overlapping laser irradiations. Upon the optimization of compositions with tailored photo-sensitivity, the re-writable ability of fluorophosphate glasses paves the way to the design of advanced photonic devices such as photonic optical circuits, evanescent sensors or 3D high-density optical data storage.

AB Cerium doped barium borate glasses were prepared in the BaO-B2O3 system. The effect of CeO2 admixture on thermal stability and structure of the glass was developed. Thermoluminescence (TL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) properties, such as glow curves, linearity of dose-response and decay curves were presented. The results showed that the increase of cerium dopant concentration from 1 to 5 mol% promotes the [BO4] formation and causes the efficiency enhancement of TL by more than ten times and OSL by more than one hundred times. Based on the XRD patterns we can state that a new phase of BaCeB9O16 was obtained, which is not present in the structural databases. The Rietveld analysis showed that the phase is isostructural to BaLaB9O16. Controlled crystallization of cerium doped borate glasses revealed that formation of the glass ceramics can enhance the intensity both of TL and OSL processes.

AB For middle infrared fiber-optic evanescent wave spectroscopy, the single-index Ge20Se80 and Ge26As57Se25Te32 glass fibers are fabricated by a crucible method. The background optical loss in the Ge20Se80 fiber is 1.5 dB/m in the 5-7.8 mu m spectral range (minimum is 0.9 dB/m at 7.1 mu m), and that in the Ge26As17Se25Te32 fiber is 1 dB/m in the range of 5.5-8.5 mu m (minimum is 0.65 dB/m at 6.6 mu m). On the basis of these chalcogenide glass fibers, the middle infrared sensors with the different geometry of sensitive zone (straight, U-shaped form, one loop, two loops) are manufactured. By the example of diesel fuel, it is shown that when passing from the straight section of the sensitive zone to the double loop, the integrated intensity of the absorption bands increases by an order of magnitude. The method of regression analysis was applied to plot a calibration dependence for the additive concentration in diesel fuel in the range of 0.1-1 vol% using a U-shaped fiber sensor. The possibility of using the luminescent Pr(3+)-doped chalcogenide fiber as the source of mid-IR radiation for recording the absorption spectra of substances absorbing in the spectral range 4-5 mu m is demonstrated.

AB Solution processed thin chalcogenide films have attracted noteworthy attention due to the simplicity and thus low cost of applicable deposition techniques (e.g. spin-coating). In presented work we demonstrate the possibility to modify the thin films composition by altering the composition of source glass solution, which significantly improves tailoring potential of solution based thin films. Thin films of As30S70 composition of specular optical quality were prepared from As40S60 bulk glass and pure elemental sulfur by spin-coating method. The As40S60 source bulk glass is also commercially available as AMTIR-6. Optical properties, thickness, chemical resistance, structure and elemental composition of the thin films were studied in dependence on the annealing temperature. Results were compared with properties of thin films of the same As30S70 composition prepared by standard procedure from As30S70 bulk glass. Different thermo-induced structural transformations were observed in both sets of samples resulting in As30S70 thin films of very similar properties after thermal stabilization at 120 degrees C.

AB Molecular dynamic simulations were performed for liquid Al72Ni16Co12 to study the transport properties and the Stokes-Einstein relation (SER). It was observed that the self-diffusion coefficient for Co is much lower and alpha-relaxation time is much longer than the other two elements. The viscosity as a function of temperature was obtained with a method of reversed non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation. The SER in terms of viscosity and alpha-relaxation time for all elements was evaluated. It is found that the effective diameter for Co increases abnormally with the decrease of the temperature. The breakdown of SER for Co between self-diffusion coefficient and viscosity or alpha-relaxation time happens in the whole temperature range covered in this work, whereas the breakdowns of SER for both Al and Ni occur respectively at 1500 K and 1200 K in term of viscosity and alpha-relaxation time, which are far above the critical temperature of mode coupling theory, T-c, around 814 K according to transport properties, and 797 K based on the alpha-relaxation time. The decoupling of element dynamics and the dynamic heterogeneity are studied by calculating the ratio of the two diffusivities for different elements, D-1/D-2, and the non-Gaussian parameter. To check the structural-dynamics correlation, the total and partial pair correlation functions are calculated. It is proposed that for Co the decoupling of self-diffusion coefficient and viscosity or alpha-relaxation time persists at all temperatures due to the strong interactions between Co atoms. And the sudden increase of the dynamic heterogeneity, accompanied by a subtle change of liquid structure, is supposed to be the reason for the abnormal breakdown of SER for Al and Ni at a temperature far above T-c.

AB The safe storage of vitrified waste demands a thorough understanding of the effects of wasteform composition on chemical durability. One of the major compositional differences between UK glass and international glasses is the presence of Li. Based upon a 25 wt% loading UK Magnox waste glass, two seven-component analogues of molar Li:Na 1.0 and 1:5 were leached to investigate the effects of Li on chemical durability. A comprehensive B-11 nuclear magnetic resonance study then took place to investigate the B network before and after dissolution.
   Here we show that the proportion of B-III to B-IV units did not evolve as the Li:Na ratio was varied; suggesting that Na preferentially charge compensates the B network. However, the B network was shown to leach incongruently at 90 degrees C. Despite Li being shown to be detrimental to durability during the earlier dissolution regimes, the residual rates of alteration implied excess Li contents had no long-term effects on chemical durability. The observed incongruent dissolution of the B network and initially decreased chemical durability could be attributed to Li preferentially modifying the Si network, thereby promoting glass hydration and B network dissolution whilst the Na compensated NB units were less affected than B-III units.

AB Novel yellow phosphor based on BaSi2O5:Gd3+&Mn2+ was prepared via melt-quenching technique. Different heat treatment schedules, based on Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA), were applied to study sequence of crystallization. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed crystallization of pure sanbornite (BaSi2O5) with orthorhombic structure with crystallite size in the 30-40 nm rang. Cell parameters revealed incorporation of the doping elements in the crystal structure. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) certifies the crystallization of well developed orthorhombic BaSi2O5 in nanosize. Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) shows a paramagnetic behavior for both glass and glass ceramic structure. Photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra obtain significant change with changing heat treatment parameters from yellow to blue color. The obtained phosphor is potential for practical application and optical devices.

AB (Fe0.5Co0.5)(73.5)Si13.5Nb3Cu1B9-xAlx (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8) nanocrystalline alloys were investigated with the aim of improving the soft magnetic properties and keeping thermal stability of initial permeability. The temperature dependence of initial permeability (mu(i) - T) was measured from room temperature up to 720 degrees C for all the alloys. The differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffractometry were performed for analyzing crystallization process and microstructure. Experimental results pointed out that the partial replacement of B with Al significantly decreased onset temperature of the primary crystallization (T-x1) from 498 degrees C to 466 degrees C and slightly increased the crystallized interval temperature (Delta T-x) from 210 degrees C to 226 degrees C. mu(i) of alloys annealed at 600 degrees C maintained a relatively stable value from ambient temperature up to 650 degrees C. Moreover, mu(i) showed a slight increase with the increase of Al content from 0.2 to 0.6, which could be ascribed to the formation of the uniform nanostructure with small grain size and high volume fraction of crystals. As a result, (Fe0.5Co0.5)(73.5)Si13.5Nb3Cu1B8.4Al0.6 nanocrystalline alloy annealed at 600 degrees C exhibited excellent soft magnetic properties at high temperature.

AB In this paper, we perform a single nanosecond pulse laser ablation of a Zr-based metallic glass (Vitreloy 1) target in water. The violent ejection of high-temperature ablation matter is observed from the target by means of explosive boiling, which is accompanied by a formation of cavitation bubble. These ablation products entered the water include a rich variety of nanoparticles that can be classified into three different types: full amorphous, amorphous-crystalline composite, and polycrystalline. The amorphous nanoparticles have relatively smaller sizes and a uniform elemental distribution. The latter two types of nanoparticles exhibit a unique core-shell feature with an obvious compositional segregation. It is proposed that the diversity of the nanoparticles closely depends on the different pathways that they enter the water: directly before the bubble formation or via the bubble, in which the cooling rate and the glass-forming ability of ablation products are two competing factors.

AB Zr-based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) offer a noticeable potential for engineering applications because of their good mechanical properties. Annealing plays an important role in changing the mechanical properties of these materials, especially the hardness and ductility. However, the effects of annealing on the tribological behavior of the BMGs are still inexplicit. In the present study, the wear behavior of the as-cast and different annealed states of Zr60Cu10Al15Ni15 BMG, i.e., sliding against AISI 52100 steel, was evaluated by the pin-on-disc measurement technique. The results indicate that the coefficient of friction varies from 0.39 to 0.63. The relaxed sample had the lowest wear rate, while the hardness of the partially and fully crystalline samples was higher than that of the glassy samples. The wear behavior of the metallic glasses and their composites depended on their wear mechanisms. The wear behavior in the as-cast and relaxed samples is controlled by the abrasive wear mechanism. Changing the dominant wear mechanism and the tendency toward brittle fracture led to a high wear rate in the partially and fully crystallized samples. The wear behavior of the samples did not follow Archard's wear equation; accordingly, to predict and investigate the wear behavior of the metallic glasses, both hardness and ductility should be considered.

AB The luminescence from Er3+ and Nd3+ co-doped 57PbO-25Bi(2)O(3)-18Ga(2)O(3) heavy metal oxide glass (HMOG) were observed and investigated. The mid-infrared emission originated from Er3+: I-4(11/2) -> I-4(13/2) transition and centered at similar to 2.7 mu m was enhanced due to the co-doping of Nd3+ ions and its concentration increase. While, visible upconversion luminescence and near infrared emission were quenched. The decrease of related lifetime indicated the energy transfer between Nd3+ and Er3+, which led to the change of luminescence. The population of Er3+: I-4(11/2) level benefitted from larger absorption cross section of Nd3+ ions and the energy transfer Nd3+: E-4(3/2) + Er3+: I-4(15/2) -> Er3+: I-4(11/2) + Nd3+: I-4(11/2) process. On the other hand, inversed energy transfer process from Er3+ to Nd3+ ions depleted the population of Er3+ :I-4(13/2) levels. The energy transfer efficiency increased with Nd3+ ions concentration increase for the shortened distance between rare earth ions,

AB In super/hyper-sonic flows in near space and low speed flows around MEMS, the gas distribution function deviates from the equilibrium, because the molecular mean free path is comparable with the characteristic length of the flow in certain part of the flow flied. The non-equilibrium distribution function makes the constitutive relations of stress and heat flux deviate from the linear form used in NS equation. Methods for rarefied flow (DSMC and DVM) and unified methods (UGKS, GKUA and DUGKS) are able to simulate non-equilibrium flows, while, for flows in near continuum regimes, their computational costs are much larger than that of the continuum NS method. For the flows in near space and around MEMS, the rarefaction and non-equilibrium effects are not too strong as these in free molecular flows. Therefore, an Extend Gas-Kinetic Scheme (EGKS) is proposed in the present article for near continuum flows and weak non-equilibrium flows where certain amount of non-equilibrium exists. As an extension of the Gas-Kinetic Scheme (GKS), by using a perturbation of the distribution function that has the maximum entropy under the constrains of conservation variables, stress and heat flux, the nonlinear constitutive relations can be directly introduced into the EGKS. There are many nonlinear constitutive relations so far, whose numerical predictions are conducted in their own frameworks. There is a huge demand for a unified and physical framework in order to investigate their validity and accuracy. Since all these constitutive relations are derived from the gas-kinetic theory, a GKS framework is chosen in consideration of physical accommodation. Burnett, SCB, RCE and NCCR nonlinear constitutive relations are used in the EGKS along with linear Stokes-Fourier relations. Using the shock structure cases in a wide range of Mach number from weak non-equilibrium to high non-equilibrium (Machnumber from 1.2 to 20), the EGKS scheme and the nonlinear constitutive relations are verified. The density, temperature, stress and heat flux profiles along with shock thickness and density-temperature separation, are systematically examined. Since the accuracy of the EGKS depends on the model of stress and heat flux used, the EGKS with nonlinear constitutive relations gives much better predictions than that with linear constitutive relations in high Machnumber cases. Benefit from the present framework, the RCE and NCCR constitutive relations are also modified using the concept and property of the entropy generation of collision term, the modified constitutive relations provide good predictions in high Machnumber shock structure calculations.

AB In this paper a new three-dimensional Eulerian interface-capturing model is proposed for the simulation of compressible solid-fluid problems. The model is a development of a well-established five equation multi-fluid model to include material strength, by incorporating a new kinematic evolution equation for the elastic stretch tensor, and augmenting the Mie-Gruneisen equation-of-state to include a contribution from elastic strain. Principal to the development of the model is the fact that a great number of solid materials can be described by the particular general equation-of-state framework, which reduces to the Mie-Gruneisen equation-of-state in the limit of zero strength and is thus equally applicable to a wide class of fluids. The constitutive models are founded on hyperelastic theory and are therefore thermodynamically compatible. Only one kinematic equation is required for arbitrary numbers of components by assuming that mixtures are described by a common deviatoric strain tensor. The system of evolution equations can be written in conservation law form, and are therefore suitable for application of Godunov's method; specifically an HLLD Riemann solver is formulated for the calculation of numerical fluxes. Interfaces are sharpened by using the THINC method in conjunction with MUSCL reconstruction. A time operator splitting strategy is used to divide the time integration into an explicit elastic update, which uses the third order TVD Runge-Kutta method, followed by an implicit plastic update. The method is verified using a number of challenging solid-fluid problems, including a high-velocity impact of a viscoplastic strain-hardening cylinder in air. The potential of the model for practical problems is demonstrated through three-dimensional simulation of an explosive buried in solid ground material.

AB The present work extends the conservative convective scheme proposed by Charnyi et al. (2017) [13], originally formulated for mixed finite elements and tested in laminar flows, to equal order finite elements. A non-incremental fractional-step method is used to stabilise pressure, allowing the use of finite element pairs that do not satisfy the inf-sup conditions, such as equal order interpolation for the velocity and pressure used in this work. The final scheme preserves momentum and angular momentum at the discrete level; the error in the conservation of kinetic energy introduced by this stabilisation is of O(delta t, h(2)) in the case of linear finite elements. The low dissipation strategy is tested on a set of relevant turbulent cases. First, by using direct numerical simulation on the inviscid and viscous Taylor-Green vortex problem at Re = 1600 and later, coupled with the Vreman (2004) [25] sub-grid stress model for performing large-eddy simulations on a turbulent channel flow at Re-tau = 950, the flow past a sphere at Re-D = 10(4) and the flow around an Ahmed body at Re-H = 2 x 10(5). In all cases the performance of the presented formulation is fairly good and it has been capable of reproducing the reference results with good accuracy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The remapping strategy is crucial in any Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) algorithm based on a Lagrange-plus-remap paradigm. This step is particularly challenging for space-staggered schemes since inconsistencies may appear between cell centered and node centered fields after remap if no special care is taken [1-3]. We propose here a space-staggered remapping strategy focusing on conservation properties and entropy control. The proposed algorithm conserves mass, total energy and respects the Second Law of Thermodynamics (for robustness) up to round-off errors. This is achieved at a low computational cost by introducing a consistent, explicit and local post processing of the linear momentum after remap. This new method is then analyzed showing that the strict momentum conservation is sacrificed. It is now conserved to the scheme's order, such as entropy. Other classical properties such that the "DeBar consistency" [4], the continuity with the Lagrangian step and the monotonicity are also discussed. This work is developed in the context of the intersection-based (or overlay-based) remap. Therefore, the rezoned mesh does not have to be close to the Lagrangian one and, even if it is not considered here, our study can be easily extended to rezoning strategies which modify the mesh connectivity.

AB The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) has been successfully applied to simulate various two-phase flow problems such as Rayleigh-Taylor instability, rising bubble, and droplet dynamics. However, the method, known as two-phase LBM, faces difficulty in simulating violent two-phase flow problems such as dam-breaking and liquid jet breakup where the density ratio and Reynolds number are high, and there are rapid and complex topological changes. In this paper, we address the problem by using a filtered cumulant LBM. The incompressible two-phase flow equations are solved by using a velocity-based formulation of two-phase LBM with a cumulant collision model to stably simulate problems with high density ratio and Reynolds number. There is no pressure iteration in this formulation and we can keep the simplicity of the cumulant model. To further enhance the stability in violent flows, a second order filter is applied on the velocity field which can be turned off for non-violent flows. For interface capturing, a conservative phase-field LBM which guarantees the mass conservation is employed. The proposed method is first validated using five non-violent flow problems and the results are in good agreements with experimental and computational references. The proposed method is then employed to solve three violent flow problems and the results are in qualitatively good agreements with experimental and computational references. The proposed method is more diffusive than the unfiltered model but is stable for all problems simulated in this paper. These results can be used as a preliminary study on violent two-phase flow simulation using two-phase LBM. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The simulation of fluid flow around moving rigid bodies has proven to be a difficult task for traditional computational fluid dynamics solvers. Decomposing the global domain into overlapping subdomains and allowing each subdomain to move independently, permits solutions to many flow problems with complex moving geometries to be determined in a straightforward manner. The present development of the moving overlapping grid method is built within a spectral element method incompressible flow solver, and uses an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation of the governing equations to prescribe subdomain motions. The method maintains global spectral spatial accuracy across the subdomains with the polynomial refinement. The global high-order temporal accuracy of the method is also maintained through subdomain coupling enforced by an explicit interface temporal extrapolation scheme. The method produces aerodynamic forces and vortex shedding around two-and three-dimensional moving rigid bodies that is in line with published experimental and computational data. Additionally, the method achieves near linear computational scaling to thousands of cores. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Fast, high-accuracy algorithms for electromagnetic scattering from axisymmetric objects are of great importance when modeling physical phenomena in optics, materials science (e.g. meta-materials), and many other fields of applied science. In this paper, we develop an FFT-accelerated separation of variables solver that can be used to efficiently invert integral equation formulations of Maxwell's equations for scattering from axisymmetric penetrable (dielectric) bodies. Using a standard variant of Muller's integral representation of the fields, our numerical solver rapidly and directly inverts the resulting second-kind integral equation. In particular, the algorithm of this work (1) rapidly evaluates the modal Green's functions, and their derivatives, via kernel splitting and the use of novel recursion formulas, (2) discretizes the underlying integral equation using generalized Gaussian quadratures on adaptive meshes, and (3) is applicable to geometries containing edges and points. Several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the aforementioned algorithm in various geometries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present an efficient nodal discontinuous Galerkin method for approximating nearly incompressible flows using the Boltzmann equations. The equations are discretized with Hermite polynomials in velocity space yielding a first order conservation law. A stabilized unsplit perfectly matching layer (PML) formulation is introduced for the resulting nonlinear flow equations. The proposed PML equations exponentially absorb the difference between the nonlinear fluctuation and the prescribed mean flow. We introduce semi-analytic time discretization methods to improve the time step restrictions in small relaxation times. We also introduce a multirate semi-analytic Adams-Bashforth method which preserves efficiency in stiff regimes. Accuracy and performance of the method are tested using distinct cases including isothermal vortex, flow around square cylinder, and wall mounted square cylinder test cases. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB A boundary thickening-based direct forcing (BTDF) immersed boundary (IB) method is proposed for fully resolved simulation of incompressible viscous flows laden with finite size particles. By slightly thickening the boundary thickness, the local communications between the Lagrangian points on the solid boundary and their neighboring fluid Eulerian grids are improved, based on an implicit direct forcing (IDF) approach and a partition-of-unity condition for the regularized delta function. This strategy yields a simple, yet much better imposition of the non-slip and non-penetration boundary conditions than the conventional direct forcing (DF) technique. In particular, the present BTDF method can achieve a numerical accuracy comparable with other representative improved methods, such as multi-direct forcing (MDF), implicit velocity correction (IVC) and the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM), while its computing cost remains much lower than them and nearly equivalent to the conventional DF method. The dependence of the optimum thickness value of boundary thickening on the form of the different regularized delta functions is also revealed. By coupling the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) with BTDF-IB, the robustness of the present BTDF IB method is demonstrated using numerical simulations of creeping flow (Re = 0.1), steady vortex separating flow (Re = 40) and unsteady vortex shedding flow (Re = 200) around a circular cylinder. The accuracy and robustness of the present method for moving particle-laden flows are performed on three benchmark cases, such as free sedimentation of single circular cylinder, DKT sedimentation of two particles and Rayleigh-Taylor instability of 504 particles sedimentation in an enclosed cavity. The computational efficiency between the present BTDF method and the MDF method is also compared at last. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Riemann problem for the shallow water equations with discontinuous topography is considered. In a general case the exact solution of this problem is not unique, which complicates the application of an exact Riemann solver in numerical methods, since it is not clear which solution should be chosen. In the present work it is shown that involving an additional physical assumption makes it possible to prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution. The assumption is that the discharge at the bottom discontinuity should continuously depend on the initial conditions. The proven uniqueness opens up a possibility to use an exact Riemann solver for a numerical solution of the shallow water equations with complex discontinuous topography. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Closed-loop field development (CLFD) optimization is a comprehensive framework for optimal development of subsurface resources. CLFD involves three major steps: 1) optimization of full development plan based on current set of models, 2) drilling new wells and collecting new spatial and temporal (production) data, 3) model calibration based on all data. This process is repeated until the optimal number of wells is drilled. This work introduces a new CLFD implementation for complex systems described by multipoint geostatistics (MPS). Model calibration is accomplished in two steps: conditioning to spatial data by a geostatistical simulation method, and conditioning to production data by optimization-based PCA. A statistical procedure (TruMAP) is presented to assess the performance of CLFD. For performance assessment by TruMAP, the methodology is applied to an oil reservoir example for 25 different true-model cases. Application of a single-step of CLFD, improved the true NPV in 64%-80% of cases. The full CLFD procedure (with three steps) improved the true NPV in 96% of cases, with an average improvement of 37%. These results indicate that probability of improving true NPV increases with closed-loop step. This massive computational experiment involved about 9.5 million reservoir simulation runs that took about 320,000 CPU hours. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Numerical simulation of two-phase flows based on the two-fluid six-equation model is the focus of this work. This approach is widely used in thermo-hydraulics for many industrial applications, particularly nuclear power plant safety analysis. A semi-implicit numerical method that has been successfully adopted in several industrial thermo-hydraulic codes, because of its efficiency and robustness, has been extended. In this paper, the governing equations are solved on unstructured grids with collocated variables to accommodate complicated geometries, and a deferred-correction method is used to deal with the non-orthogonality of unstructured grids. In addition, the numerical method is conservative, meaning that it is capable of capturing a shock wave exactly in single-phase flows, and ensuring the conservation of physically conservative quantities of a two-phase flow mixture. Numerical benchmarks and industrial test cases are performed in order to validate the numerical method and to evaluate its behavior with respect to different physical configurations.

AB The density matrix is a widely used tool in quantum mechanics. In order to determine its evolution with respect to time, the Liouville-von Neumann equation must be solved. However, analytic solutions of this differential equation exist only for simple cases. Additionally, if the equation is coupled to Maxwell's equations to model light-matter interaction, the resulting equation set - the Maxwell-Bloch or Maxwell-Liouville-von Neumann (MLN) equations - becomes nonlinear. In these advanced cases, numerical methods are required. Since the density matrix has certain mathematical properties, the numerical methods applied should be designed to preserve those properties. We establish the criterion that only methods that have a completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) update map can be used in long-term simulations. Subsequently, we assess the three most widely used methods - the matrix exponential (ME) method, the Runge-Kutta (RK) method, and the predictor-corrector (PC) approach - whether they provide this feature, and demonstrate that only the update step of the matrix exponential method is a CPTP map.

AB A methodology for the decomposition of the overset grid assembly problem is presented and evaluated. The method is based on identifying grid subsets of a computational domain for which each domain connectivity is calculated individually, and combined at run time to obtain the final complete solution. The proposed method is a framework for the partition of the problem based on the characteristics of the simulation and relies on the user's knowledge of the case, avoiding some of the pitfalls of automatic methods. The methodology was implemented in a computational fluid dynamics solver, allowing the scalable computation of very large simulations of moving bodies, with efficient use of the computational resources. Several examples illustrating the method and the performance improvements with respect to the standard assembly approach are presented. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates the use of radial basis function (RBF) interpolants to estimate a function's fractional Laplacian of a given order through a mesh-free pseudospectral method. The mesh-free approach yields an algorithm that can be implemented in high dimensional settings without adjustment. Moreover, the fractional Laplacian is defined in terms of the Fourier transform, and the symmetry of RBFs can be exploited to simplify the estimation problem. Convergence rates are established for RBFs when the function whose fractional Laplacian to be estimated is compactly supported. Further results demonstrate convergence when a function is in the native space for a Wendland RBF (i.e. a Sobolev space) and satisfies a certain L-1 condition. Numerical experiments demonstrate the developed method by estimating the fractional Laplacian of several functions and by solving a fractional Poisson equation with extended Dirichlet condition in one and two dimensions.

AB Wormhole propagation, arising in petroleum engineering, is used to describe the distribution of acid and the increase of porosity in carbonate reservoir under dissolution of injected acid. The important physical features of porosity and acid concentration include their boundedness between 0 and 1, as well as the monotone increasing for porosity. How to keep these properties in the simulation is crucial to the robustness of the numerical algorithm. In this paper, we propose high-order bound-preserving discontinuous Galerkin methods to keep these important physical properties. The main technique is to introduce a new variable r to replace the original acid concentration and use a consistent flux pair to deduce a ghost equation such that the positive-preserving technique can be applied on both original and deduced equations. A high-order slope limiter is used to keep a polynomial upper bound which changes over time for r. Moreover, the high-order accuracy is attained by the flux limiter. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the high-order accuracy and bound-preserving property of the numerical technique. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a new compatible finite element advection scheme for the compressible Euler equations. Unlike the discretisations described in Cotter and Kuzmin (2016) and Shipton et al.(2018), the discretisation uses the lowest-order family of compatible finite element spaces, but still retains second-order numerical accuracy. This scheme obtains this second-order accuracy by first 'recovering' the function in higher-order spaces, before using the discontinuous Galerkin advection schemes of Cotter and Kuzmin (2016). As well as describing the scheme, we also present its stability properties and a strategy for ensuring boundedness. We then demonstrate its properties through some numerical tests, before presenting its use within a model solving the compressible Euler equations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The paper describes the dissipative and dispersive properties of a hybrid RANS-LES Cartesian method specifically designed to study complex three-dimensional viscous flows. A skew-symmetric convective operator is employed to low the influence of numerical dissipation and dispersion on the physical phenomena especially when solving highly separated flows. The main objective is to conserve not only momentum and energy but also their quadratic forms. In principle, this should enhance the correct evolution of the turbulent kinetic energy in the wake of bluff-bodies thus allowing a confident estimate of the relevant scales. Here an immersed boundary technique is coupled with a wall-model in order to make affordable the study of high Reynolds number flows. The first part of the results is dedicated to basic one-and two-dimensional studies aiming at evaluating the performance of the scheme at the interface between cells of different size. Indeed, the refined Cartesian meshes are characterized by a fixed cell-size ratio of two and accuracy issues can locally occur. Moreover, three-dimensional test-cases are carried out whose results are compared with solutions from body-conforming methods and experimental data when available. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB We present a GPU-accelerated version of a high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The equations are discretized in time using a semi-implicit scheme with explicit treatment of the nonlinear term and implicit treatment of the split Stokes operators. The pressure system is solved with a conjugate gradient method together with a fully GPU-accelerated multigrid preconditioner which is designed to minimize memory requirements and to increase overall performance. A semi-Lagrangian subcycling advection algorithm is used to shift the computational load per timestep away from the pressure Poisson solve by allowing larger timestep sizes in exchange for an increased number of advection steps. Numerical results confirm we achieve the design order accuracy in time and space. We optimize the performance of the most time-consuming kernels by tuning the fine-grain parallelism, memory utilization, and maximizing bandwidth. To assess overall performance we present an empirically calibrated roofline performance model for a target GPU to explain the achieved efficiency. We demonstrate that, in the most cases, the kernels used in the solver are close to their empirically predicted roofline performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a novel Roe-type Riemann solver is developed for solving incompressible two-phase flow problems. The two-phase flow is modeled by coupling the artificial compressibility based Navier-Stokes equations and an interface advection equation in a conservative level set framework. The proposed Roe solver does not assume a locally constant density field while evaluating the flux Jacobian. As a result, the solver is capable of capturing the exact jump conditions across the contact and shear waves, which in turn helps in enhancing the accuracy of the interface motion. Moreover, mass conservation characteristics are significantly improved by adopting conservative level set framework together with finite volume discretization of the system of equations. A dual time stepping method with explicit pseudo-time marching scheme is used for modeling the unsteady terms. The efficacy of the proposed solver is demonstrated using various standard incompressible two-phase flow problems, involving low amplitude sloshing, broken dam, Rayleigh-Taylor instability and droplet splash.

AB A new approach for solution of Stochastic structural Mechanics problem with random coefficient in the framework of Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansion is proposed. The basic strategy of the proposed method is to iteratively construct a PC expansion with reduced numbers of unknown coefficients. The method is based on orthogonal expansion of stochastic responses and generation of an iterative PC based on the responses of the previous iteration. The polynomials are evaluated using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process. The number of random variables in PC expansion is reduced by considering only the dominant components of the response characteristics, which is evaluated using Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion. In case of random material field problem, KL expansion is used to discretize the random field. The usefulness of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency is examined. The results of linear static structural mechanics problems are compared with MCS and PC method. The proposed method is observed to be computationally more efficient and accurate than PC method.

ID PSEUDOSPECTRAL METHOD; FLOWS
AB We develop a volume penalization method for inhomogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, generalizing the flux-based volume penalization method for homogeneous Neumann boundary condition proposed by Kadoch et al. (2012) [4]. The generalized method allows us to model scalar flux through walls in geometries of complex shape using simple, e.g. Cartesian, domains for solving the governing equations. We examine the properties of the method, by considering a one-dimensional Poisson equation with different Neumann boundary conditions. The penalized Laplace operator is discretized by second order central finite-differences and interpolation. The discretization and penalization errors are thus assessed for several test problems. Convergence properties of the discretized operator and the solution of the penalized equation are analyzed. The generalized method is then applied to an advection-diffusion equation coupled with the Navier-Stokes equations in an annular domain which is immersed in a square domain. The application is verified by numerical simulation of steady free convection in a concentric annulus heated through the inner cylinder surface using an extended square domain. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB The topology optimization of a thin plate structure with bounded damping layer patches under external harmonic excitations to suppress the vibrations of specified points in the plate is investigated. The piecewise constant level set (PCLS) method is applied to represent the region with damping material and the region only with base material. Applying Melosh-Zienkiewicz-Cheung (MZC) element, the stiffness matrix, the mass matrix and the damping matrix are expressed in detail, where the global non-proportional damping matrix is considered. The functional derivative of the objective function (the squared vibration amplitudes of specified points in a plate) with respect to the PCLS function is deduced, by introducing the adjoint problems and applying matrix sensitivity analysis. The quadratic penalty method and the total variation regularization are utilized to fulfill the volume constraint and to avoid checkerboard patterns, respectively. A penalty gradient algorithm is proposed. In numerical experiments, three rectangular plates with different boundary conditions and locations of the external excitations are investigated. Effects of the excitation frequency as well as the damping coefficients on topology optimization results are also discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a novel numerical approach to monolithic two-way fluid-structure interaction. Our formulation applies to both sub-grid solids that may be significantly smaller than a single computational grid cell as well as more resolved solid bodies. Importantly, we remove the non-physical ansatz of velocity equilibration for sub-grid bodies, allowing for physically accurate behavior even though the boundary layer is drastically under-resolved or typically even completely absent. Instead, we obtain closure by incorporating a physical model for drag. Our coupling system has numerically advantageous properties, including symmetric positive-definiteness, and is extensible to various interpolation schemes, enabling it to capture the exact solution in the case of neutral buoyancy. We provide a number of numerical examples illuminating the advantages and limitations of our approach. We close with remarks about future possibilities for pursuing advanced subgrid modeling as well as incorporating machine learning techniques into drag modeling. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Spectral methods provide an elegant and efficient way of numerically solving differential equations of all kinds. For smooth problems, truncation error for spectral methods vanishes exponentially in the infinity norm and L-2-norm. However, for non-smooth problems, convergence is significantly worse-the L-2-norm of the error for a discontinuous problem will converge at a sub-linear rate and the infinity norm will not converge at all. We explore and improve upon a post-processing technique-optimally convergent mollifiers-to recover exponential convergence from a poorly-converging spectral reconstruction of non-smooth data. This is an important first step towards using these techniques for simulations of realistic systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a robust, adaptive numerical scheme for simulating high density ratio and high shear multiphase flows on locally refined staggered Cartesian grids that adapt to the evolving interfaces and track regions of high vorticity. The algorithm combines the interface capturing level set method with a variable-coefficient incompressible Navier-Stokes solver that is demonstrated to stably resolve material contrast ratios of up to six orders of magnitude. The discretization approach ensures second-order pointwise accuracy for both velocity and pressure with several physical boundary treatments, including velocity and traction boundary conditions. The paper includes several test cases that demonstrate the order of accuracy and algorithmic scalability of the flow solver. To ensure the stability of the numerical scheme in the presence of high density and viscosity ratios, we employ a consistent treatment of mass and momentum transport in the conservative form of discrete equations. This consistency is achieved by solving an additional mass balance equation, which we approximate via a strong stability preserving Runga-Kutta time integrator and by employing the same mass flux (obtained from the mass equation) in the discrete momentum equation. The scheme uses higher-order total variation diminishing (TVD) and convection-boundedness criterion (CBC) satisfying limiter to avoid numerical fluctuations in the transported density field. The high-order bounded convective transport is done on a dimension-by-dimension basis, which makes the scheme simple to implement. We also demonstrate through several test cases that the lack of consistent mass and momentum transport in non-conservative formulations, which are commonly used in practice, or the use of non-CBC satisfying limiters can yield very large numerical error and very poor accuracy for convection-dominant high density ratio flows. Our numerical scheme also uses well-balanced surface tension and gravity force discretizations. In the hydrostatic limit, we show that the well-balanced formulation mitigates spurious flow currents and achieves discrete force-balance between the pressure gradient and surface tension or gravity.

AB A two-way coupled Cloud-In-Cell (CIC) formulation for particle-laden flows is presented that accounts for cloud size and subgrid-scale stresses using averaging techniques, and for cloud deformation using methods from continuum mechanics. It traces a physical cloud of particles as a point and distributes its influence on the carrier flow via a multivariate Gaussian distribution function. The method extends the one-way coupled SPARSE (Subgrid Particle-Averaged Reynolds Stress-Equivalent) method in Davis et al. (2017) [20] to account for two-way coupling between the fluid and dispersed phases and the effect of subcloud thermal stresses resulting from fluctuations in the velocity and temperature of the physical particles amalgamated in each macro-particle. Two-dimensional benchmark simulations of a Mach 3.5 normal shock impinging on an initially stationary particle cloud show that the two-way coupled SPARSE model predicts the average cloud position and spread more accurately than a two-way coupled, first-order CIC approach, illustrating the importance of accounting for higher-order moments and cloud deformation. Through an appropriate initial division of the particle cloud into subclouds, SPARSE's predictions of the time-averaged horizontal and vertical cloud spread match those of a reference Particle-Source-In-Cell (PSIC) approach to within less than 4% and 1%, respectively, using up to two orders of magnitude fewer computational particles. This makes SPARSE a suitable tool for enabling accurate process-scale simulations of particle-laden flows that are not feasible with current PSIC or CIC methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

DE Feature selection; Perturbation theory; Least angle regression
ID MUTUAL INFORMATION
AB Consider a supervised dataset D = [A vertical bar b]. where b is the outcome column, rows of D correspond to observations, and columns of A are the features of the dataset. A central problem in machine learning and pattern recognition is to select the most important features from D to be able to predict the outcome. In this paper, we provide a new feature selection method where we use perturbation theory to detect correlations between features. We solve AX = b using the method of least squares and singular value decomposition of A. In practical applications, such as in bioinformatics, the number of rows of A (observations) are much less than the number of columns of A (features). So we are dealing with singular matrices with big condition numbers. Although it is known that the solutions of least square problems in singular case are very sensitive to perturbations in A, our novel approach in this paper is to prove that the correlations between features can be detected by applying perturbations to A. The effectiveness of our method is verified by performing a series of comparisons with conventional and novel feature selection methods in the literature. It is demonstrated that in most situations, our method chooses considerably less number of features while attaining or exceeding the accuracy of the other methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The University Course Scheduling Problem (UCSP) is a highly constrained real-world combinatorial optimization task. Solving UCSP means creating an optimal course schedule by assigning courses to specific rooms, instructors, students, and timeslots by taking into account the given constraints. Several studies have reported different metaheuristic approaches for solving UCSP including Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Harmony Search (HS) algorithm. Various Swarm Intelligence (SI) optimization methods have also been investigated for UCSP in recent times and a few Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based methods among them with different adaptations are shown to be effective. In this study, a novel PSO-based method is investigated for solving highly constrained UCSP in which basic PSO operations are transformed to tackle combinatorial optimization task of UCSP and a few new operations are introduced to PSO to solve UCSP efficiently. In the proposed method, swap sequence-based velocity computation and its application are developed to transform individual particles in order to improve them. Selective search and forceful swap operation with repair mechanism are the additional new operations in the proposed method for updating particles with calculated swap sequences as velocities. The proposed PSO with selective search (PSOSS) method has been tested on an instance of UCSP for the Computer Science and Engineering Department of Khulna University of Engineering & Technology which has many hard and soft constraints. Experimental results revealed the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed method compared to other prominent metaheuristic methods (e.g., GA, HS). (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Developing a high-security expert and intelligent system that cannot be copied, stolen or lost is one of the challenging issues and led to the presence of the "biometric systems". Electrocardiogram (ECG) becomes an emerging expert biometric modality which captured the attention of many researchers due to its resistant to counterfeiting. However, the low accuracy of ECG-based systems, compared to the other biometric methods, demands more accurate and novel algorithms. This study attempts addressing this issue by providing new information-based algorithms. First, it presents a novel feature extraction methodology based on information theory (IT) for ECG-based human authentication. To this end, we designate a composite feature set using the traditional ECG characteristic points and the IT-based indices, including Cauchy-Schwartz divergence (CSD), Euclidean distance (ED), Cauchy-Schwartz quadratic mutual information (CSQMI), Euclidean distance quadratic mutual information (EDQMI), and cross information potential (CIP). Second, an innovative procedure is proposed for selecting the appropriate features to increase the performance of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier based on the information gain ratio (IGR). We evaluated the effect of changing the classifier parameter and the kernel size of features on classification accuracy: Experimental results show that the use of the CIP-based indices with 2NN leads to higher accuracy rates up to 100%. The highest average rate of accuracy was 97.62 +/- 1.92. These results over the 90 participants make our proposed framework a superior scheme compared to the state-of-the-art ECG authentication approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The reconstruction of cross-cut shredded text documents (RCCSTD) is an important problem in forensics and is a real, complex and notable issue for information security and judicial investigations. It can be considered a special kind of greedy square jigsaw puzzle and has attracted the attention of many researchers. Clustering fragments into several rows is a crucial and difficult step in RCCSTD. However, existing approaches achieve low clustering accuracy. This paper therefore proposes a new clustering algorithm based on horizontal projection and a constrained seed K-means algorithm to improve the clustering accuracy. The constrained seed K-means algorithm draws upon expert knowledge and has the following characteristics: 1) the first fragment in each row is easy to distinguish and the unidimensional signals that are extracted from the first fragment can be used as the initial clustering center: 2) two or more prior fragments cannot be clustered together. To improve the splicing accuracy in the rows, a penalty coefficient is added to a traditional cost function. Experiments were carried out on 10 text documents. The accuracy of the clustering algorithm was 99.1% and the overall splicing accuracy was 91.0%, according to our measurements. The algorithm was compared with two other approaches and was found to offer significantly improved performance in terms of clustering accuracy. Our approach obtained the best results of RCCSTD problem based on our experiment results. Moreover, a more complex and real problem - reconstruction of cross-cut shredded dual text documents (RCCSDTD) problem - was tried to solve. The satisfactory results for RCCSDTD problems in some cases were obtained, to authors' best knowledge, our method is the first feasible approach for RCCSDTD problem. On the other hand, the developed system is fundamentally an expert system that is being specifically applied to solve RCCSTD problems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Diabetes mellitus is a medical condition examined by data miners for reasons such as significant health complications in affected people, the economic impact on healthcare networks, and so on. In order to find the main causes of this disease, researchers look into the patient's lifestyle, hereditary information, etc. The goal of data mining in this context is to find patterns that make early detection of the disease and proper treatment easier. Due to the high volume of data involved in therapeutic contexts and disease diagnosis, provision of the intended treatment method become almost impossible over a short period of time. This justifies the use of pre-processing techniques and data reduction methods in such contexts. In this regard, clustering and meta-heuristic algorithms maintain important roles. In this paper, a method based on the k-means clustering algorithm is first utilized to detect and delete outliers. Then, in order to select significant and effective features, four bi-objective meta-heuristic algorithms are employed to choose the least number of significant features with the highest classification accuracy using support vector machines (SVM). In addition, the 10-fold cross validation (CV) method is used to validate the constructed model. Using real case data, it is concluded that the multi-objective firefly (MOFA) and multi-objective imperialist competitive algorithm (MOICA) with a 100% classification accuracy outperform the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) with the accuracies of 98.2% and 94.6%, respectively.

AB This study focuses on the aging evaluation of Insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) modules to ensure their stability during operation. An aging degree evaluation model is proposed based on whale optimization algorithm optimized extreme learning machine (WOA-ELM) algorithm. This study is mainly concentrated on two aspects. One is to use WOA to optimize the input weights and hidden layer biases of ELM to improve its prediction performance. This study tested the performance of WOA-ELM on several benchmark datasets. The results show that the prediction performance of WOA-ELM is better than ELM, genetic algorithm optimized ELM, cuckoo search optimized ELM, and dandelion algorithm optimized ELM. The other is to measure the electrical and thermal characteristic data of IGBT module under different aging conditions by accelerated aging test. Based on the analysis of the experimental data under different aging degrees, a method for evaluating the aging degree of IGBT modules based on WOA-ELM is proposed. Simulation results based on experimental data show that WOA-ELM still has better accuracy and generalization performance than others. In summary, the WOA-ELM algorithm is applicable to the aging evaluation method of IGBT modules proposed in this study which has good practical value. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many of today's businesses are driven by data, and while traditionally only quantitative data is considered, the role of textual data in our digital world is rapidly increasing. Text mining allows to extract and aggregate numerical data from textual documents, which in turn can be used to improve key decision processes. In this paper, we propose Heracles, a framework for developing and evaluating text mining algorithms, with a broad range of applications in industry. In contrast to other frameworks, Heracles supports both the development and evaluation stages of text mining algorithms. A practical use case shows the versatility and ease-of-use of the proposed framework in the domain of aspect-based sentiment analysis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adaptive e-learning employs algorithmic mechanisms in order to orchestrate the pace of instruction and provide tailored learning objects to support the unique educational experience of each learner. Taking this into consideration, this research work presents a fully operating and evaluated adaptive and intelligent e-learning system for second language acquisition. This system uses a hybrid model for misconception detection and identification (MDI) and an inference system for the dynamic delivery of the learning objects tailored to learners' needs. More specifically, the MDI mechanism incorporates the Fuzzy String Searching and The String Interpreting Resemblance algorithms in order to reason between possible learners' misconceptions. Furthermore, the inference system utilizes the knowledge inference relationship between the learning objects and creates a personalized learning environment for each student. The paper presents examples of operation and the system is evaluated using an evaluation model. The results are very encouraging and promising since they reveal that the hybrid model for misconception detection and identification and the inference system operate collaboratively and enhance the adaptivity of the students' needs and preferences.

AB In multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problems, 2-dimension linguistic term set (2DLTS) is useful for modelling both the linguistic evaluations on alternatives and the decision makers' self-assessments. This paper extends the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE) methods to solve 2-dimension linguistic MADM problems. The extended PROMETHEE methods with 2DLTSs are mainly based on the improvement of the preference functions. For measuring two 2-dimension linguistic elements (2DLEs) in the improved preference functions, the possibility degree (PD) for 2DLEs is proposed to describe the PD of one 2DLE no less than another. It is shown that the PD for 2DLEs can measure the PD between two incomparable 2DLEs as well as two comparable 2DLEs. Furthermore, two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed methods in solving the MADM problems evaluated by 2DLEs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We propose a development of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) permitting to use the methodology also for decision problems with a very large number of alternatives and several criteria. While the application of the original AHP method involves many pairwise comparisons between considered objects. that can be alternatives with respect to considered criteria or criteria between them, our parsimonious proposal is composed of five steps: (i) direct evaluation of the objects at hand: (ii) selection of some reference objects: (iii) application of the original AHP method to the reference objects: (iv) check of the consistency of the pairwise comparisons of AHP and the compatibility between the rating and the prioritization with a subsequent discussion with the decision maker who can modify the rating or pairwise comparisons of reference objects: (v) revision of the direct evaluation on the basis of the prioritization supplied by AHP on reference objects. Our approach permits to avoid the distortion of comparing more relevant objects (reference points) with less relevant objects. Moreover, our AHP approach avoids rank reversal problems, that is. changes of the order in the prioritizations due to adding or removing one or more objects from the set of considered objects. The new proposal has been tested and experimentally validated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Violence detection is one of the substantial and challenging topics in intelligent video surveillance systems. As there is a growing demand on video surveillance systems with the capability of automatic violence detection, we focus on existing violence detection methods to improve them. In this paper, we introduce a new feature descriptor named Histogram of Optical flow Magnitude and Orientation (HOMO). First, the proposed method converts input frames to the grayscale format. Next, it computes the optical flow between two consequence frames. Then, the optical flow magnitude and orientation of each pixel in each frame are compared separately with its predecessor frame to obtain meaningful changes of magnitude and orientation. Subsequently, different threshold values are applied to the magnitude and orientation changes for obtaining six binary indicators. Finally, these binary indicators are analyzed to get the HOMO descriptor which is used to train a SVM classifier. The system has been implemented using MATLAB. To evaluate the proposed method, two benchmark datasets have been used. The comparison of HOMO and other descriptors on benchmark datasets demonstrates satisfactory performance.

AB In this paper, we propose the exponential Levy neural network (ELNN) for option pricing, which is a new non-parametric exponential Levy model using artificial neural networks (ANN). The ELNN fully integrates the ANNs with the exponential Levy model, a conventional pricing model. So, the ELNN can improve ANN-based models to avoid several essential issues such as unacceptable outcomes and inconsistent pricing of over-the-counter products. Moreover, the ELNN is the first applicable non-parametric exponential Levy model by virtue of outstanding researches on optimization in the field of ANN. The existing non-parametric models are rather not robust for application in practice. The empirical tests with S&P 500 option prices show that the ELNN fits the data better than two parametric exp-Levy models and its estimates are less overfit than another network-based model.

TI Explanations by arbitrated argumentative dispute
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Argumentation; Explanation; Legislative data
AB Explaining outputs determined algorithmically by machines is one of the most pressing and studied problems in Artificial Intelligence (Al) nowadays, but the equally pressing problem of using Al to explain outputs determined by humans is less studied. In this paper we advance a novel methodology integrating case-based reasoning and computational argumentation from Al to explain outcomes, determined by humans or by machines, indifferently, for cases characterised by discrete (static) features and/or (dynamic) stages. At the heart of our methodology lies the concept of arbitrated argumentative disputes between two fictitious disputants arguing, respectively, for or against a case's output in need of explanation, and where this case acts as an arbiter. Specifically, in explaining the outcome of a case in question, the disputants put forward as arguments relevant cases favouring their respective positions, with arguments/cases conflicting due to their features, stages and outcomes, and the applicability of arguments/cases arbitrated by the features and stages of the case in question. We in addition use arbitrated dispute trees to identify the excess features that help the winning disputant to win the dispute and thus complement the explanation.
   We evaluate our novel methodology theoretically, proving desirable properties thereof, and empirically, in the context of primary legislation in the United Kingdom (UK), concerning the passage of Bills that may or may not become laws. High-level factors underpinning a Bill's passage are its content-agnostic features such as type, number of sponsors, ballot order, as well as the UK Parliament's rules of conduct. Given high numbers of proposed legislation (hundreds of Bills a year), it is hard even for legal experts to explain on a large scale why certain Bills pass or not. We show how our methodology can address this problem by automatically providing high-level explanations of why Bills pass or not, based on the given Bills and their content-agnostic features.

AB Credit risk assessment is an important task for the implementation of the bank policies and commercial strategies. In this paper, we used a discrete Bayesian network with a latent variable to model the payment default of loans subscribers. The proposed Bayesian network includes a built-in clustering feature. A full procedure for learning its parameters, based on a customized Expectation-Maximization algorithm was provided. This model allows evaluating the payment default probability taking into account several factors and handling a multi-class situation. Relying on a real data set describing loans contracts, we calibrated the model and performed several analyses. The obtained results highlight a regime switching of the default probability distribution: Two classes were determined showing a change in credit risk profiles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The prediction of drug candidates for given tissues of organisms based on expression data is a critical biological problem. By correctly predicting drug candidates for given tissues, biologists can (1) avoid an experimental process of high-throughput screening that requires excessive time and costly equipment and (2) accelerate the drug discovery process by automatically assigning drug candidates. Although high throughput screening for therapeutic compounds lead to the generation of expression data, the process of correctly assigning candidate drugs based on such data remains a rigorous task. Hence, the design of high-performance machine learning (ML) algorithms is crucial for data analysts who work with clinicians. Clinicians incorporate advanced ML tools into expert and intelligent systems to improve the drug discovery process by accurately identifying drug candidates. The transfer learning approaches that are necessary to improve the prediction performance of several tasks that are involved in identifying drug candidates are presented in this paper. The performances of machine learning algorithms are compared in the transfer learning setting by employing several evaluation measures on real data that are obtained from experiments conducted on rats to identify drug candidates. The experimental results show that the proposed transfer learning approaches outperform baseline approaches in terms of prediction performance and statistical significance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Due to the appearance of Web 2.0 technologies and smartphones, the amount of information available to carry out group decision-making processes has increased dramatically. Therefore, there is a need for group decision-making methods that are capable of dealing with environments that handle a high number of alternatives. In this paper, a novel group decision-making method that can deal with these kinds of environments has been developed. Thanks to card-sorting techniques, it is possible to reduce the number of alternatives that the experts have to deal with using their own knowledge. Thanks to this, experts do not have to rely on information from any external source as it is done in other similar methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION
AB One of the most important issues to tackle in data classification has been the existence of non-informative features in feature sets. Therefore, feature construction (FC) is an important pre-processing task to construct discriminating features from the original ones. Gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is a powerful swarm-based metaheuristic algorithm, which has been improved and adapted to represent multiple new constructed features. Most of the swarm-based algorithms entail a population of individuals while one individual would be returned as an optimal solution at the end of the process. In this paper, the solutions' structure of GSA have been changed in a way that each individual can be considered as a part of the solution, and the final result consists of the whole population. Consequently, each individual is a constructed feature aiming to achieve a population of good features. In other words, the proposed method is a novel multiple feature construction (MFC) method based on the GSA which is called in brief GSAMFC. The experimental results on thirteen standard data sets demonstrate that the proposed GSAMFC is highly beneficial for providing suitable and small feature subsets as well as improving the classifier accuracy. The obtained results of GSAMFC and those of the competing algorithms prove the proficiency of the proposed method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In tourist sector, expert and intelligent systems should perform at least two main tasks or services: point of interest recommendation and route generation. In this regard, the personalized electronic tourist guide, generally implemented on hand-held device, such as mobile applications or in web. These tools must work like an expert and intelligent system that perform the services mentioned above then they should need low computation effort. In this paper we focus on the route generation based on scores of the points of interest and the distance or time between them. We consider a new extension of the Tourist Trip Design Problem, named Tourist Trip Design Problem with Clustered Points of Interest, where points of interest are grouped in clusters representing different types of attraction sites. Moreover, minimum/maximum limits are imposed on the number of points of interest belonging to the each clusters that are visited in the same route. Since it is a novel problem, we generate two sets of instances in order to evaluate the accuracy of our solution approach. A Fuzzy GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure), in which both distance based and score based evaluation criteria are used to guide the candidates selection in the construction phase is proposed. The results provided by our heuristic are compared with those obtained by solving the MIP formulation. Computational results carried out on real and real-like instances show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach and its suitability to be part of a Personalized Electronic Tourist Guide in hand-held devices.

AB The aim of this study is to provide visual pruning and decision tree selection for classification and regression trees. Specifically, we introduce an unedited tree graph to be made informative for recursive tree data partitioning. A decision tree is visually selected through a dendrogram-like procedure or through automatic tree-size selection. Our proposal is a one-step procedure whereby the most predictive paths are visualized. This method appears to be useful in all real world cases where tree-path interpretation is crucial. Experimental evaluations using real world data sets are presented. The performance was very similar to Classification and Regression Trees (CART) benchmarking methodology, showing that our method is a valid alternative to the well-known method of cost-complexity pruning.

AB Considering multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problems under uncertain environment, this paper presents a novel concept of intuitionistic fuzzy rough numbers (IFRNs), which is fused by intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs) and rough numbers (RNs), and proposes a new approach for MCGDM based on IFRNs. The proposed approach can aggregate group information and obtain the final decision results in an objective and effective way. First, we propose the constructing process of IFRNs and discuss the arithmetic operations, ranking rules, aggregation operators, as well as some corresponding properties. Then the novel concept of IFRN is used to aggregate intuitionistic fuzzy information given by decision group. Based on the aggregated IFRNs, the MABAC model is extended from two perspectives, obtaining an IFN-based MABAC model and an IFRN-based MABAC model respectively. Finally an empirical example of supplier selection for medical devices is utilized to show the application of proposed models, and comparisons with five traditional models, of which three refer to information aggregating and two refer to alternatives selecting, are made to validate the effectiveness and superiority of proposed methods.

AB The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), created by congress in 2011, receives and processes consumer complaints pertaining to various financial services. Every complaint narrative provides insight into problems that consumers are experiencing. With increasing number of the CFPB complaint narratives, manual review of these documents by human experts is not feasible. This requires an intelligent system to analyze narratives automatically and provide insightful knowledge to the experts. In this paper, we propose an intelligent approach based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to analyze the CFPB consumer complaints. The proposed approach aims to extract latent topics in the CFPB complaint narratives, and explores their associated trends over time. The time trends will then be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the CFPB regulations and expectations on financial institutions in creating a consumer oriented culture. The technology-human partnership between the proposed approach and the CFPB experts could certainly improve consumer experience by providing more efficient and effective investigations of consumer complaint narratives.

AB Discovering hidden patterns under unexpected market shocks is a significant and challenging problem, which continually attracts attention from research communities of mathematics, economics, and data science. Classic financial pricing models present unsatisfactory prediction accuracy when applied to realworld data due to limited capacity in depicting complex market movements. In this paper, we develop a machine learning approach, called ARMA-GARCH-NN, to capture intra-day patterns for stock market shock forecasting. Specifically, we integrate classical financial pricing models with artificial neural networks. with explicitly designed feature selection and cross-validation methods. We conduct empirical studies on high-frequency data of the U.S. stock market for evaluation. Our results provide initial evidence of the predictability of market shocks. Additionally, we confirm the effectiveness of ARMA-GARCH-NN by recognizing patterns in massive stock data without strong assumptions on distribution. Our method can serve as a portable methodology that integrates the advantages of traditional financial models and datadriven methods to reveal hidden patterns in large-scale financial data.

AB Most often, image segmentation is not fully automated and a user is required to lead the process in order to obtain correct results. In a medical context, segmentation can furnish much information to surgeons, but this task is rarely executed. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful approach for devising a viable solution to fully automated treatment. In this paper, we have focused on kidneys deformed by nephroblastoma. However, a frequent medical constraint is encountered which is a lack of sufficient data with which to train our system. In function of this constraint, two AI approaches were used to segment these structures. First, a Case Based Reasoning (CBR) approach was defined which can enhance the growth of regions for segmentation of deformed kidneys using an adaptation phase to modify coordinates of recovered seeds. This CBR approach was confronted with manual region growing and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CBR system succeeded in performing the best segmentation for the kidney with a mean Dice of 0.83. Deep Learning was then examined as a possible solution, using the latest performing networks for image segmentation. However, for relevant efficiency, this method requires a large data set. An option would be to manually segment only certain representative slices from a patient and then use them to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) how to segment. In this article the authors propose an evaluation of a CNN for medical image segmentation following different training sets with a variable number of manual segmentations. To choose slices to train the CNN, an Overlearning Vector for Valid Sparse SegmentatIONs (OV2 ASSION) was used, with the notion of gap between two slices from the training set. This protocol made it possible to obtain reliable segmentations of per patient with a small data set and to determine that only 26% of initial segmented slices are required to obtain a complete segmentation of a patient with a mean Dice of 0.897.

AB Nowadays there are many on-line applications in which users' feedback is used to compute a trust value for products, services and also other users. In those application domains, trust models are required and extensively used. Since trust is context-dependent, currently, there is an increasing interest in the development of trust models that specifically consider the multi-context nature of trust. In this article, we propose a symbolic multi-context trust model where information will have a trust degree and an associated context. The set of available contexts will be related through a taxonomy of contexts that can be adapted to the application domain being modeled. We propose different alternatives to expand the information of one context using information from contexts that are related through the taxonomy. Algorithms for the implementation of our approach that consider strategies for handling conflicts will be introduced. Also, results of an empirical analysis of our proposal will be given.

AB In the present scenario, humans are surrounded by numerous diseases which affect their lifestyles. One such condition is glaucoma which originates due to sudden stress in the eye, generally termed as intraocular pressure culminating in the affliction of the optic nerve and permanent loss of vision. It is the second highest characteristic root of blindness. The optic nerve is liable for a transference of visual details to the brain from retina leading one to locate the exterior world. Clinical diagnosis of glaucoma includes an examination of the optic cup, optic disc and measurement of intraocular pressure by tonometer, pachymetry, etc. All these tasks are manual and time-consuming hence, a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system is needed for evaluation of glaucoma which can be done by analysis of optic disc and optic cup present in retinal fundus images using image processing approaches. Here, optic disc represents the entrance of optic nerve and site from where retinal nerve cells approach towards each other while, the optic cup is the centric depression of irregular size residing on the disc. In this work, a Level Set Based Adaptively Regularized Kernel-Based Intuitionistic Fuzzy C means (LARKIFCM) based approach is proposed for segmentation of optic disc and optic cup in retinal fundus images with improved performance for accurate diagnosis.

AB Objective: An epileptic seizure is recognized as a neurological disorder caused by transient and unexpected disturbance resulting from the excessive synchronous activity of the neurons in the brain. Analysis of epileptic seizures derived from long-term recordings of electroencephalogram (EEG) is cumbersome and time consuming for a neurologist. Therefore, introducing an automated detection system surrogate the neurologist involvement all time and speed up the treatment procedure.
   Methods: This study introduces a matrix determinant of EEG as a significant feature for recognition of epileptic seizures. Initially, artifact-free filtered EEG time series was arranged sequentially to form a square matrix of order, namely 13, 16, 23, and 32 and determinant was estimated. Assumed that the total elements in the square matrix represent a typical segmentation length. The experiment was conducted using EEG database obtained from the University of Bonn and Ramaiah Medical College and Hospital (RMCH). In total, eleven classification problems among non-epileptic group and epileptic EEG were composed to examine temporal dynamics of brain activity in different states of the epileptic activity. Next, the extracted feature was classified using support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifiers with 10-fold cross-validation.
   Results: Experimental results revealed the highest classification accuracy of 99.45% (using University of Bonn) and 97.56% (using RMCH). between normal and epileptic EEG. In addition, other classification problems and matrix orders showed better results using all the classifiers. Further, descriptive analysis, histogram plot in polar coordinates and the bivariate histogram analysis was performed. In conclusion, matrix determinant found to be a potential biomarker for the real-time detection of epileptic seizure with minimal computational complexity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we present two approaches to extract discriminative features for color image retrieval. The proposed local texture descriptors, based on Radial Mean Local Binary Pattern (RMLBP), are called Color RMCLBP (CRMCLBP) and Prototype Data Model (PDM). RMLBP is a robust to noise descriptor which has been proposed to extract texture features of gray scale images for texture classification.
   For the first descriptor, the Radial Mean Completed Local Binary Pattern is applied to channels of the color space, independently. Then, the final descriptor is achieved by concatenating the histogram of the CRMCLBP_S/M/C component of each channel. Moreover, to enhance the performance of the proposed method, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used for feature weighting.
   The second proposed descriptor, PDM, uses the three outputs of CRMCLBP (CRMCLBP_S, CRMCLBP_M, CRMCLBP_C) as discriminative features for each pixel of a color image. Then, a set of representative feature vectors are selected from each image by applying k-means clustering algorithm. This set of selected prototypes are compared by means of a new similarity measure to find the most relevant images. Finally, the weighted versions of PDM is constructed using PSO algorithm.
   Our proposed methods are tested on Wang, Corel-5k, Corel-10k and Holidays datasets. The results show that our proposed methods makes an admissible tradeoff between speed and retrieval accuracy. The first descriptor enhances the state-of-the-art color texture descriptors in both aspects. The second one is a very fast retrieval algorithm which extracts discriminative features.

ID DISAMBIGUATION
AB Investors utilise social media such as Twitter as a means of sharing news surrounding financials stocks listed on international stock exchanges. Company ticker symbols are used to uniquely identify companies listed on stock exchanges and can be embedded within tweets to create clickable hyperlinks referred to as cashtags, allowing investors to associate their tweets with specific companies. The main limitation is that identical ticker symbols are present on exchanges all over the world, and when searching for such cashtags on Twitter, a stream of tweets is returned which match any company in which the cashtag refers to - we refer to this as a cashtag collision. The presence of colliding cashtags could sow confusion for investors seeking news regarding a specific company. A resolution to this issue would benefit investors who rely on the speediness of tweets for financial information, saving them precious time. We propose a methodology to resolve this problem which combines Natural Language Processing and Data Fusion to construct company-specific corpora to aid in the detection and resolution of colliding cashtags, so that tweets can be classified as being related to a specific stock exchange or not. Supervised machine learning classifiers are trained twice on each tweet - once on a count vectorisation of the tweet text, and again with the assistance of features contained in the company-specific corpora. We validate the cashtag collision methodology by carrying out an experiment involving companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. Results show that several machine learning classifiers benefit from the use of the custom corpora, yielding higher classification accuracy in the prediction and resolution of colliding cashtags.

AB Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect manifests itself as an unstable plastic flow during the tensile tests of aluminum alloys. With the increase of Zr content in high strength Al-Cu-Mg-Mn alloys, the stress-strain curves transform from smooth flow to serrated flow. The transition is attributed to the grain refinement as well as the interaction among Al3Zr precipitates, solute atoms and dislocations. What's more, yield plateau (YP) phenomenon starts to appear when the Zr content reaches 1 wt.%. These findings provide a new perspective on tailoring mechanical behavior by alloy design for selective laser melting (SLM). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In search of alternatives of Platinum-based electrocatalysts, graphene - Phthalocyanine composites are under recent research focus. We, therefore, in this study, have addressed and explored the electrochemical performances of graphene/copper phthalocyanine nanocomposites towards oxygen reduction reaction. It is found that, graphene functionalized copper phthalocyanine show better catalytic activity than bare phthalocyanine nanostructure, which may be attributed to the pi-pi interaction between the components and higher conductivity of graphene in the composite.

AB In this paper, a novel form stable phase change material (FSPCM) of Palmitic acid (PA)/Carbonized pepper straw (CPS) was prepared by using the facile direct impregnation method. The chemical compatibility of PA/CPS FSPCM was investigated by using the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry analysis were applied to characterize the latent heat and thermal stability, the results of which show that the compatibility between PA and CPS is good. The phase change temperature and latent heat of PA/CPS FSPCM is 65.7 degrees C and 95.5 J/g for the melting process and 56.1 degrees C and 90.2 J/g for the solidification process. Moreover, the FSPCM had excellent thermal reliability even after 100 cycles. All the results indicate that the PA/CPS FSPCM has great potential for use in green building and indoor heat system.

AB Pillar-like nanostructures were fabricated on surface of ITO/PET directly by thermal nanoimprinting. The reflectance spectra of ITO/PET have been reduced apparently at incident angles of light in range of 10-80 degrees. Meanwhile, the contact angle of deionized (DI) water is also enhanced from 73.1 to 93.4 degrees. The absolute enhancement of short-circuit current density (J(sc)) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) for flexible perovskite solar cells are nearly 0.48-1.75 mA/cm(2) and 0.34-0.69% when tilt angles varied from 0 to 60 degrees in PCE measurement. This method is cost-effective, and can be utilized for different kinds of plastic-based solar cells. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel ZnO/Nd-BiOBr composites were facilely synthesized via a surfactant-free chemical approach. The ZnO nanoflakes were loaded on the surface of Nd-BiOBr nanosheets with intimately contact. The synthesized ZnO/Nd-BiOBr demonstrated significantly higher visible light photocatalytic degradation of phenol compared to those of ZnO, BiOBr and Nd-BiOBr. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of ZnO/Nd-BiOBr was attributed to the effective separation of photogenerated electron-hole in the heterojunction structure as proven via the photoluminescence spectra. In addition, the ZnO/Nd-BiOBr showed good stability in phenol degradation for four irradiation cycles. The radical trapping experiments indicated that the hydroxyl radicals played key role in the photodegradation process. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE M-type ferrite; Epitaxial growth; Sputtering; Magnetic properties
AB M-type hexaferrite BaFe12O19 films that exhibit a uniaxial magnetic-crystalline anisotropy hold great application promise in the field of magnetic data-storage and microwave devices. In this letter, BaFe12O19 thin films that show an out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy were prepared on c-plane Al2O3 substrates by direct current magnetron sputtering, which is high-efficiency but seldom adopted in the fabrication of ceramic materials including most hexaferrites. In addition, the textured BaFe12O19 film with hexagonal c-axis lying in the film surface was also discussed in this work. The epitaxial-like growth of the BaFe12O19 films was characterized by the combination of x-ray diffractions and pole figures. Self-biasing properties of the films induced by the epitaxial-like structure were reflected in the magnetic measurement of hysteresis loops. The film sample deposited at high temperature of 600 degrees C exhibited a relatively large remanent magnetization (65% of the saturation magnetization) normal to the film surface, and a small one of <10% along in-plane directions, showing their potential for application in planar magnetic devices with light weight.

SEM images demonstrate the formation of interconnected macropores. Cube-shaped zeolite particles are intergrown at their interfaces, establishing a stable porous system. XRD results confirm the purity and crystallinity of zeolite LTA. BET and MIP results indicate three levels of pores (micro-, meso- and macrospores) present in the zeolite monolith. In addition, the BET surface area, bulk density, true density of the hierarchical zeolite are 57.67 m(2)/g, 0.684 g/cm(3) and 2.771 g/cm(3), respectively, and the total porosity is up to 75.3 vol%.

AB Nb-Mo-Si based in situ composite powders were fabricated by a hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reaction. The Nb-6Mo-20Si-3Cr alloy ingot was prepared by vacuum arc melting and was composed of a metal solid solution phase and a (Nb, Mo)(5)Si-3 silicide phase. For hydrogenation, the ingot was annealed under a hydrogen atmosphere and the hydrogenated ingot could be easily pulverized by milling due to its brittle nature. As a result of absorbing hydrogen, the hydrogenated powder had a higher hydrogen concentration and lattice parameter than the ingot. The powder was annealed under a vacuum atmosphere for dehydrogenation and the hydrogen concentration and lattice parameter decreased to the same value as those of the ingot. By applying the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation method, Nb-6Mo-20Si-3Cr alloy powder could be successfully fabricated. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The miscibility and surface tension gradient between the upper and subphase solvents were shown as key factors in the self-assembly of magnetic nanoparticles at the liquid-air interface. The drop-casting of magnetic nanoparticles suspended in hexane does not result in a long-range pattern on the surface of liquid subphases of lower surface tension gradient and higher miscibility with hexane. Instead, nanoparticles disperse into the mixture between upper and subphase solvents. By contrast, the low miscibility and high surface tension gradient between deionized water subphase and hexane lead to a long-range ordered monolayer. Interestingly, domains of hexagonal close-packed superlattices and honeycomb pattern are also obtained. According to this unique finding, a variety of two-dimensional ordered structures can be assembled at water-air interface. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydrogen generation through electrocatalytic water reduction using copious and scalable electrocatalyst is one of the potential method to produce clean energy. Transition metal dichalcogenides with appropriate band potential have been demonstrated as potential electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here in we have synthesized nanostructured FeS2 and FeSe2 that possess defined and irregular shaped flower like morphology using solvothermal reduction method. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) confirms the pyrite FeS2 (iron disulfide) and orthorhombic phase FeSe2 (iron diselenide) and compared it's HER catalytic performance. FeSe2 exhibited lower over potential of 113 mV with a current of 2 mA/cm(2) (10 mA/cm(2) current at 244 mV) compared to FeS2 with over potential 453 mV. The improved catalytic behavior of FeSe2 can be attributed to favourable bond strength between selenide and hydrogen (276 kJ/mol) which is about 87 kJ/mol lesser than FeS2 (363 kJ/mol).

ID CRYSTALLIZATION
AB The amorphous rapidly quenched quasi-binary TiNi-TiCu alloys containing 30-38 at.% Cu were crystal-lized by isothermal annealing at 500 degrees C for 300 s and by exposing to short electric pulse with a duration of 10 ms to study the effect of the annealing rate on their properties. The results obtained showed that electropulse crystallization fundamentally changed the microstructure of the alloys due to almost completely hindering the formation of brittle Ti-Cu phases. This leads to a significant increase in the enthalpy of the martensitic transformation and a considerable shift of the transformation range towards higher temperatures. It was found that reducing the crystallization time dramatically increases the plasticity and shape memory effect of the alloys. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For the first time, we prepared the trigonal ZnIn2S4 (in the space group R-3m) by typical solid state reaction at 700 degrees C in an evacuated quartz tube. It has a high crystallinity indicated by sharp reflection peaks in X-ray diffraction pattern, and its suitable band structure ensure the visible light driven photocatalytic H-2 generation in Na2S and Na2SO3 aqueous solution. The as-prepared ZnIn2S4 possesses a constant photocatalytic H-2 generation rate of similar to 32 mu mol/g/h after 5 cycles, which could be significantly enhanced to 1582 mu mol/g/h by co-loading 0.5 wt% Pt and 0.5 wt% Pd. By varying the incident beam intensity, the apparent quantum yield of photocatalytic water reduction was evaluated and optimized to 3.57(1)% at 405 nm. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fe-Al intermetallic layers were formed on the surface of twinning induced plasticity (TWIP) steel by hot-dipping aluminum (HDA) and subsequent thermal diffusion treatment (TDT). It was shown that the coating layer was composed of Al, FeAl3 and Fe2Al5 phases in the hot-dip state while only Fe3Al phase retained after subsequent TDT. It was found that, the corrosion resistance of TWIP steel had been significantly improved with a shift of 224 mV in the E-corr towards anodic direction and the j(corr) reduced from 26.1 mu A/cm(2) to 2.70 mu A/cm(2). Fe-Al intermetallics could lower the corrosion rate because the Al2O3 film formed during stable soak stage was slightly stable due to the higher aluminum content than matrix steel.

AB Ti-40Nb alloy is an excellent choice for long-term implant applications due to its biocompatibility, high corrosion resistance and low Young's modulus. To improve osteointegration and biological performance, hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings with ionic substitutions such as Sr or/and Mg have been proposed. Thus, the aim of this work was to obtain Sr substituted HA and Sr/Mg-co-substituted hydroxyapatite coatings using electrochemical deposition onto Ti-40Nb alloys. This technique has a high versatility and ability to coat irregular surfaces. The results showed it is possible to obtain a Sr-HA or Sr/Mg-HA coatings onto Ti-40Nb alloys using this method. The incorporation of 0.5% of Sr into HA produces a homogenous layer with a cauliflower-like microstructure of calcium deficient hydroxyapatite nanocrystals; while the addition of Mg as co-dopant (Sr + Mg = 1%) inhibits the hydroxyapatite crystallization, modified the microstructure to nanosphere-like crystals and increases Ca-deficiency.

AB The strontium (Sr2+) and chlorine (Cl-) substituted tricalcium phosphate (TCP) were synthesized via aqueous precipitation method. To understand the effect of the Sr2+ and Cl- doping on mechanical properties of tricalcium phosphate (TCP) ceramics, dense TCP compacts of different compositions were prepared and sintered at 1100 degrees C for 1 h. X-ray diffraction of sintered samples revealed that dopants turn into beta-TCP to HA phase transformation during sintering. The binary combination and amount of co-dopants significantly affect the microstructure. The microhardness of the samples increased with increasing of the Sr2+ and Cl- ion concentrations. Cl- ion addition, 2.5-10 mol% affect micro hardness results negatively. A comparison between samples were carried out and differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05 (standard deviation: 1.2296 GPa). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results reveal that cells/dendrites refine, and the results of numerical simulation confirm that the magnetic field forms thermoelectric (TE) magnetic convection, resulting in the enrichment of the solute Cu in the liquid ahead of the liquid/solid interface. The cells/dendrites refinement under the magnetic field should be attributed to the increase of the interdendritic constitutional undercooling caused by the enhancement of the solute Cu.

AB To solve the problems of high bonding temperature and spontaneous oxidation of Cu nanoparticles, a novel Cu-Ag composite nanoparticle paste was developed and demonstrated for low temperature bonding. The composite nanoparticles have small particle size (9 nm) and good oxidation resistance. The effect of bonding temperature on the mechanical properties and microstructure evolutions of bonded joints was investigated. The Cu-Cu bonded joints exhibit high shear strength of 18.9 MPa at a low bonding temperature of 225 degrees C, and the fracture microstructures exhibit significant ductile deformations, which are attributed to the sufficient sintering of nanoparticles. The results demonstrate that the Cu-Ag composite nanoparticle paste is a promising die attach material for low temperature bonding. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A multilayer nest-like TiO2 nanostructure assembled from one-dimensional nanowires has been synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. This special structure not only has the characteristics of a network structure with many nanojunctions but also has high efficiency of gas transmission. We have revealed its remarkable gas sensitive property toward ethanol through a comparative study with unmodified nanowires. It is believed that its excellent gas sensing is due to its special nest-like structure providing a large number of chemical reaction chambers and sufficient gas transmission channels.

AB In this work, a novel two-dimensional seawave-like hierarchical WO3 nanocomposite was synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal route. It was amazing that this novel two-dimensional WO3 nanostructure was composed of one-dimensional worm-like WO3 nanowires. Furthermore, a ultra-sensitivity towards ammonia was shown primarily attributed to abundant gas diffusion channels and large gas-sensitive reaction surface area furnished by one-dimensional worm-like WO3 nanowires. Meanwhile, as the building units, the worm-like nanowires promote the directional transmission of electrons, resulting in an improvement of WO3 gas sensing characteristics. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Novel MnO2 nanozymes were prepared as nanosheets in situ using spherical poly[(2-methacryloyloxyethyl) trimethyl ammonium chloride] (PDMC) brushes (SPB) as nanoreactors. The prepared MnO2 nanozymes were immobilized in SPB (SPB-MnO2) showing high stability and excellent oxidase-like property which could oxidize 3,30,5,50-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) into oxidized TMB (oxTMB), accompanied by the change of absorption at 653 nm. The MnO2 nanosheets could be decomposed by trace amount of glutathione (GSH) under acidic environment as validated by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The SPB-MnO2/TMB system, with a detection limit of 450 nM, should be an ideal candidate for colorimetric detection of GSH. This work opens a new way to prepare highly stable nanozymes for the detection of GSH. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Collagen scaffolds provide a promising platform for tissue regeneration due to their ability to support cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation. In this study, we used porous freeze-dried collagen scaffolds with either uniaxially-aligned or randomly-oriented pores to investigate the formation of vascular structures in vitro. We characterised the scaffold pore structure, specific permeability, cell migration and endothelial cell self-assembly into vessel-like networks in mono- and co-culture with osteoblasts. Our work shows that improved pre-vascularisation can be achieved in uniaxially-aligned scaffolds and in a co-culture environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB V2O5 hollow spheres coated Ni-foam (VO-HS/NF) is hydrothermally synthesized by an in-situ strategy. Diameter of VO-HS ranges from 300 nm to 500 nm, and the shell thickness is about 40 nm on average. The electrochemical properties of VO-HS/NF electrode demonstrate that it chemically stores charges by redox via the intercalation pseudocapacitance. The symmetrical supercapacitor (SSC) device is assembled using VO-HS/NF as the binder-free electrode and its electrochemical performance is studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). VO-HS/NF SSC device exhibits the pseudocapacitive behavior with specific capacitance of 135 mF.cm(-2) at 0.5 mA.cm(-2) and energy density of 356 mW.h.m(-2) at 3.5 W.m(-2) owing to the good ion response and high-quality contact between VO-HS and NF. This work provides an effective and facile strategy for synthesizing additive-free VO-HS/NF as high-performance electrodes for energy storage devices. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB TiO2 nanoparticles have emerged as prominent heterogeneous photocatalysts for hydrogen (H-2) production. But pristine TiO2 suffers from photogenerated charge-carrier recombination and limited absorption towards visible light. Present work is about preparation of economically viable TiO2-graphitic carbon core/shell nanocomposite for hydrogen production via one-pot hydrothermal route. The prepared core/shell catalyst is successful in depriving recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and extending the visible light absorption of TiO2. These improvements resulted in higher H-2 production values upto 27.1 mmol g(-1) h(-1) under optimized conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) on metallic Co@N-doped carbon (NC) (Co@NC) were investigated. The Co@NC catalysts obtained via pyrolysis of a metal-organic framework precursor (ZIF-67) showed high Faraday efficiency under ambient conditions in neutral electrolytes. At -0.9 V versus Ag/AgCl, the Faraday efficiency of Co@NC achieved as high as 21.79%, surpassing most of reported catalysts under comparable conditions, while the NH3 yield rate of Co@NC reached 1.57 x 10(-10) mol s(-1) cm(-2) at the same potential. This work demonstrated that Co@NC had outstanding electrocatalytic performance for NRR. Thus it was a promising transition-metal-based catalyst in electrochemical ammonia synthesis.

AB Nanofibrous hydroxyapatite (HAp) composed of nanoparticles was successfully fabricated by assembling amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) nanoparticles with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) by electrospinning. ACP-PVA nanofibers were obtained by electrospinning. A nanofibrous HAp was fabricated by calcination of the ACP-PVA nanofibers, and the obtained HAp nanofibers were composed of nanoparticles and had nanopores. The concentrations of ACP and the PVA binder in the spinning solution affected the morphology of the obtained nanofibrous HAp structure; rodlike, meshlike, and fiberlike structures were obtained by adjusting the concentrations.

ID MICROSTRUCTURES
AB Microstructure and tensile behavior of CoCrFeNi2.1Nbx (x = 0.2, 0.4) high entropy alloys were investigated in the as-cast and aged (800 degrees C/24 h) conditions. Increasing Nb addition increased strength but reduced ductility due to the increased volume fraction of Laves phase. On aging, fine acicular precipitates formed throughout the matrix in the CoCrFeNi2.1Nb0.4 alloy, but only at the dendrite boundaries in the CoCrFeNi2.1Nb0.2 alloy. While both the aged alloys showed increase in strength due to the presence of the fine precipitates, the favorable microstructure of the CoCrFeNi2.1Nb0.2 ensured a larger mean free path for gliding dislocations, thus rendering superior strength-ductility synergy.

AB Fiber-shaped rechargeable batteries are expected to be the energy storage device as a necessary part of the next generation of wearable electronics. However, their application is severely hindered by the difficulty in manufacture of flexible fiber-shaped electrodes with promising electrochemical performance. Here, we fabricated the unique self-supporting nanotube array of sulfur-doped TiO2 (S-TiO2) to obtain flexible fiber-shaped electrode with excellent sodium storage properties. The as-prepared S-TiO2 fiber electrode has a high reversible capacity of about 183 mA h g(-1) at 40 mA g(-1), excellent rate capability (142 mA h g(-1) at 80 mA g(-1)) and stable cycling performance (75% retention over 100 cycles at 80 mA g(-1)). It is worth noting that a flexible fiber-shaped sodium-ion battery was maintained a high reversible capacity under different bending states. This work offers a novel electrode-fabrication method towards broadenning metallic oxide fiber electrodes application especailly in flexible energy storage devices. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The diffusion experiments were performed using bulk samples with the diffusant (Cu) source having a constant concentration at medium temperatures. It was found that surface energy increases with copper concentration in silver-based solid solution. The measurements of bulk and GBD indicate that diffusion along the grain boundaries (GB) is suppressed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Biodegradable zinc-based alloy; Surface treatment; In-vitro testing;
   Cytotoxicity; Biocompatibility
AB Zinc-based alloys hold promise as next generation biodegradable implants. Although zinc implants exhibit excellent biocompatibility in vivo, they have been found to inhibit cell attachment and viability under in vitro conditions. In order to clarify the cell response disparity and improve the biocompatibility of zinc implant materials, Zn-1Mg and Zn-1Mg-0.5Ca alloys underwent surface stabilization treatment in cell culture medium. Surface processing resulted in a stable surface oxide film of similar to 300 nm thickness. The stability of the oxide layer substantially increased the viability of cells in both direct and indirect contact assays. It is consequently believed that the surface film characteristics of zinc implants may be an important determinant of biocompatibility. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A composite coating of rutile and sodium titanate with similar color of human natural tooth was successfully prepared on TC4 titanium alloy substrate with anodic oxidation method for dental implant application. The color of the coating could be regulated by the anodic oxidation treatment. The coating on TC4 was super hydrophilic, and its thickness was about 30 mu m, and the bonding strength between the coating and the substrate could be high as 30 MPa. The coating showed bioactivity in simulated body fluid by inducing bone-like apatite formation on its surface, which might be caused by the slow sodium ions releasing from the sodium titanate hydrolyzing in the simulated body fluid.

AB Fluoride is known to stimulate bone formation. Recently, novel sodium-free fluoride-containing bioactive glasses (FBGs) were found to be highly bioactive, dissolved in Tris and SBF buffer solutions releasing ions and promoting fluorapatite formation and offered great potential for medical and dental applications. However, there is very limited knowledge on the biological effects of these glasses, which are extremely important for clinical applications. This study investigated the bioactivity of FBGs and their osteogenic and angiogenic effects on MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts in alpha-MEM for the very first time. Results showed that these highly bioactive novel FBGs were non-cytotoxic. The addition of fluoride promoted mineralization, collagen formation, osteogenic and angiogenic genes expression in osteoblasts. Compared to sodium-containing BGs, a higher amount of fluoride can be incorporated into sodium-free BGs to improve glass biological effects. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The resulting hybrid photo-anode offers an enhancement of 43% in photocurrent density than bare ZnO nano-rods.

AB Aiming to overcome the problem of polymer degradation in water based drilling fluids under high temperature, this letter examined the influence of laponite nanoparticles on the thermal stability of drilling fluids. Firstly, a terpolymer (AAD) was synthesized through radical polymerization of acrylamide, 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid, and diallyldimethylammonium chloride monomers. The presence of laponite nanoparticles significantly improved the onset decomposition temperature and viscosities of AAD terpolymer at high temperatures, according to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and high temperature high pressure (HTHP) rheology results, respectively. Thereafter, water based drilling fluids containing AAD and laponite were formulated and aged under different temperatures. The drilling fluids containing laponite had a substantially higher viscosity than that without laponite ascribing to strong interactions between laponite and functional groups of the ADD terpolymer. This letter provided us a novel strategy to develop high temperature resistant drilling fluids for deep reservoir excavation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work three different plant extracts (R. officinalis, U. dioica and V. vitis-idaea) were used for AgNPs bioreduction. IR spectroscopy, UV-vis, TEM and size distribution analyses were used for functional groups identification and AgNPs characterization. UV-vis spectrum of solution with R. officinalis extract showed strong, narrow peak at 418 nm (peak confirmed presence of AgNPs), also TEM analysis confirmed formation of fine (empty set10-20 nm), spherical AgNPs. Additionally, these nanoparticles were very stable. UV-vis spectrum of solution with U. dioica extract showed peak at 408 nm, NPs were uniform, spherical (similar to 15 nm) but they stability was not constant (after few days agglomeration started). Nanoparticles synthesized by V. vitis-idaea extract were extremely unstable, agglomeration appeared immediately after extract adding. IR spectra confirmed differences in composition of R. officinalis, U. dioica and V. vitis-idaea extracts. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Lithium sulfide (Li2S)-based rechargeable battery has aroused much interest in the last few years because of its enhanced safety stemming from eliminating lithium metal anode and its high energy density. Here, we demonstrated a new-designed Li2S-based full cell with high energy density composed of the freestanding Li2S-rGO cathode and MnO2-rGO anode. Li2S-rGO cathode and rGO-MnO2 anode exhibit a high capacity even based on the whole electrode, 367.5mAh g(Li2S) (-1)(electrode) and 644.1 mAh g(MnO2) (-1)(electrode), respectively, which are benefitted from their free-standing nature and unique morphology of active material wrapped by rGO sheets. When incorporating Li2S-rGO cathode and MnO2-rGO anode, Li2S/MnO2 full cell can achieve a high capacity of 587.5 mAh g(Li2S)(-1) and a high energy density of 827.3 Wh kg(Li2S)(-1) at 0.2 C.

AB Anodic rutile TiO2 nanotube arrays on Ti foil annealed at 850 degrees C was successfully synthesized without annihilating the nanotubular structures using novelty annealing approach. The significant morphological characteristics of the rutile nanotube arrays were employed to fabricate excellent-photoresponse characteristics of UV photodetector. The performance of electrical and photoresponse was investigated and the findings demonstrated that UV photodetector under illumination (395 nm, 2.62 mW/cm(2)) exhibited a high sensitivity (3600), rapid response time (0.8 s) and rapid recovery time (0.81 s) at bias voltage 5 V. The photodetector demonstrated remarkable stability and reproducibility emergence with time. In addition, the photoresponse characteristics were performed at distinct bias voltages and light intensities. As illustrated above, the photodetector based on rutile nanotube arrays is an encouraging nano-optoelectronic device that is excellently applicable for UV spectrum. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Material extrusion additive manufacturing can be used for producing metal specimens when combined with debinding and sintering, similar to metal injection moulding. A highly-filled polymeric filament containing 55 vol% of 17-4PH stainless steel powder was prepared and used to print dog-bone specimens. Printed specimens were debound and sintered to obtain metallic specimens. The tensile properties were investigated. The average Young's modulus was determined to be 196 GPa, the average maximum stress was 696 MPa and the strain at break 4%. Adequate cohesion between layers during material extrusion additive manufacturing is crucial for improving the mechanical properties of sintered specimens. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB beta-Bi2O3/ZnO composites have been successfully prepared using CO32- mediated method and subsequent calcination. The photocatalytic results showed that beta-Bi2O3/ZnO composites exhibited much higher photocatalytic activities than that of pure ZnO and beta-Bi2O3 and outstanding recyclability under visible-light irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic efficiency was mainly attributed to the beta-Bi2O3/ZnO composites in which efficiently suppressed the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and the enhanced visible light harvest.

AB Epsilon-negative materials are usually prepared by additive manufacturing, while a reverse design method needs to be developed to construct the epsilon-negative materials by subtractive manufacturing. Here the Nickel-Network/Epoxy composites were prepared via a chemical corrosion and curing process. The connectivity of nickel network was weakened by chemical corrosion, which was companied with a change of conductivity mechanism from metal-type conductivity to the hopping conductivity. The negative permittivity value could be effectively adjusted by corroding the nickel network, which was attributed to low-frequency plasmonic state of nickel network. The reverse design method provided a novel and more flexible method to construct the desired the epsilon-negative materials. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Chloroform (CF) and dimethyl formamide (DMF) were used as good solvents, while dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as a poor solvent to generate pores on the fiber surface. The effects of PCL concentration, DMSO amount and BG particles dosage on the surface morphology of electrospun fibers were investigated, respectively. Fibrous scaffolds with well-distributed pores and uniform diameter were successfully obtained by using 12% w/v PCL in solution with good/poor solvent ratios at 90% v/v. The addition of BG particles (< 8%w/v)in electrospun solution did not lead to any deformation of the porous fibers. The porous fibrous scaffolds incorporated with BG particles may be a promising scaffolds for soft tissue engineering. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nanocrystalline metals usually exhibit high strain rate sensitivity m, while the magnitude of m in amorphous alloys are relatively lower and near zero. In the present letter, however, a two phase NiW composites involving nanocrystals dispersed in amorphous matrix exhibited unexpected large m even higher than that of the monolithic nanocrystalline NiW. The underlying mechanism involving the interactions between nanocrystalline and amorphous phases was proposed, as the confined crystalline and amorphous phases behaved quite differently from their monolithic counterparts.

AB The structural, morphological and optical properties of silver pyrophosphate (Ag4P2O7) powders were investigated in detail. This material was synthesized by chemical precipitation (CP), conventional hydrothermal and microwave-assisted hydrothermal. The crystallization of hexagonal Ag4P2O7 phase presented a dependence with both temperature and synthesis approach. A system composed of doughnut/hexagonal-shaped microparticles was evidenced for the powders obtained by CP. The hydrothermal treatments modified these particle shapes. Ultraviolet-visible spectra revealed a band gap controlled by indirect electronic transitions. Broadband photoluminescence spectra with maximum emissions in blue region were detected, suggesting the participation of several intermediary energy levels in the band gap. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, a novel three-dimensional (3D) scaffold consisting of hollow mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) nanofibers was synthesized via template-assisted sol-gel method. The hollow mesoporous fibers show an ultra-small diameter of around 40 nm, which is the smallest among all currently reported MBG fibers, and the resultant scaffold possesses a large specific surface area of 579.0 m(2) g(-1), which is the largest of all MBG products reported so far. It is believed that such ultrafine diameter and the presence of mesopores will endow the scaffold with excellent bioactivity, which makes it a promising candidate in controlled drug release and bone tissue engineering.

AB To optimize the column planting process of copper column grid array (CuCGA) package, friction plunge welding was proposed to implement the solder/Cu column interconnect assisted without mold. On account of friction and extrusion action during feeding of Cu column, high homologous temperature and large strain, which conformed to the condition of dynamic recrystallization, were generated in the solder zones near interface. The irregular island-like, fragment-like recrystallization alpha-Pb phases and striped-like alpha-Pb phases in beta-Sn matrix formed at different distances from the interface of Sn37Pb/Cu column, respectively. Meanwhile, a thin, wave-like Sn/Cu diffusion layer formed at the interface. This indicates that micro-join can also be achieved by friction welding method, and the column planting is changed into a solid-state welding from conventional soft soldering. After the subsequent reflow soldering, the diffusion layer transformed into scallop-like, most alpha-Pb phases in the solder regressed to disk-like, and the pull-out load of joint is not lower than that of traditional column planting method.

AB Here, a novel hierarchical composite of Co0.2Ni0.4Zn0.4Fe2O4 nanoparticles (CNZF) decorated on MXenes (Ti3C2Tx/CNZF) was fabricated by a moderate hydrothermal reaction. Thanks to the CNZF nanoparticles that are favorable to the delamination of hierarchical structure, the dielectric loss and multiple scattering of Ti3C2Tx/CNZF are greatly enhanced. Accordingly, the composite exhibited a remarkable microwave absorption, with a maximum reflectivity of -58.4 dB at 6.2 GHz. Likewise, the efficient bandwidth is at lower frequency region of 3.8-6.0 GHz as thickness was 4.2 mm. The present method provide a strategy to design novel 2D absorbers by allowing ultrasmall magnetic particles to deposit at the hierarchical structure. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Superhydrophobic (SH) silica (SiO2) nanoparticles (NPs) were successfully synthesized through a simple and facile technique. The effect of chlorosilane isomers was investigated by the grafting of butyl-trichlorosilane (C4But) and dichloro (3-chloropropyl) methylsilane (C4Di) on superhydrophilic SiO2 NPs. The SEM results displayed that the particle size of C4Di modified SiO2 (C4Di-SiO2) NPs was larger than C4But modified SiO2 (C4But-SiO2). This can be due to the steric effect of the methyl group on the C4Di segment. The wetting analysis revealed that C4Di-SiO2 cannot reach SH criteria as it showed a water contact angle (WCA) of 149 degrees and a sliding angle (SA) over 10 degrees, while C4But-SiO2 showed a SH surface with a WCA of 159 degrees and SA of 2 degrees. Interestingly, the modified SiO2 NPs created a transparent film on the glass substrate which is a key opportunity for self-cleaning application. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

DE Electron microscopy; Nanoparticles; MgAg phase; Atomic resolution
AB The compositional and structural evolution of precipitates in Al-Mg-Ag alloy were investigated by atomic resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. The study suggests that Ag-addition promoted the formation of elliptical-shaped GP zones at the early-aged stage. Then the GP zones transformed to metastable MgAg phase and the orientation relationship between the precipitate and Al-matrix was (100)(MgAg)//(100)(alpha). The equilibrium phase in Al-Mg-Ag alloy can be speculated as rod-like body-centered cubic T phase (Mg-32(Al, Ag)(49)) with the lattice parameter of a = 1.41 nm. The rod-like MgAg phase and T phase serve as the key strengthening mechanism of Al-Mg-Ag alloys at the peak-age stage. In addition, the role of GBPs in the strengthening effect of Al-Mg-Ag alloys was also discussed in detail. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sesamin and sesamolin constitute the main bioactive secondary metabolites of sesame seeds (Sesamum indicum L., Pedaliaceae). In the present work, a rapid HPTLC-based methodology was developed in compliance with the requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia for the quantification of these two lignans in sesame seeds. A comparative study was simultaneously performed with HPLC-PDA for assessing the sesamin and sesamolin content of diverse samples. Both methods were validated and the results were subsequently subjected to statistical analysis in order to compare their performance as well as to investigate possible correlations. The methods were shown to be adequately correlated in terms of performance, as revealed by Pearson's rank correlation coefficients (> 0.99 for sesamin and > 0.98 for sesamolin) and Bland-Altman analysis (relative method bias 0.06-0.21, SD of bias 0.05-0.07). HPTLC densitometry could thereby serve as a valid and reliable tool for the rapid determination of the major lignans in sesame seed samples.

AB EU regulation classifies egg production in four hen housing systems: organic, free range, barn and cages. However, there are no analytical methods for a complete detection of the housing systems declared on the eggs' label. This work describes a new method for this task. A lipid extract was obtained, and eggs classified in the four housing systems by UV-VIS-NIR spectroscopy and chemometrics. A total of 192 spectra were analysed. Eggs were classified by Support Vector Machine classification and Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (LDA and QDA, respectively). The cholesterol concentration did not allow to classify correctly the four farming systems. However, the yolk lipid extract successfully classified the eggs of the hen housing system. Results showed 100% accuracy by UV-VIS-NIR spectrum of the yolk lipid extract with the QDA statistical analysis. These results indicate that this lipid extract is a promising tool for analytical verification of the farming system.

AB miRNA sequencing was applied in this work to screen miRNA biomarkers related to beta(2)-agonists from the test and control goat samples. A total of 10 selected miRNAs were proven by qRT-PCR to be able to separate treatment cell groups from the control. With previously reported differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we used target gene prediction to build a miRNA-mRNA regulatory network related to beta(2)-agonists, which validated the miRNA biomarkers and provided a reference for identifying the mechanism of beta(2)-agonists. Our subsequent in vivo experiments revealed that the regulation trends of the miRNAs were the same as in vitro experiments. DD-SIMCA and heatmap analysis also indicated concordant separation effects with the 10 miRNAs, which could therefore be used as biomarkers to monitor illegal use of beta(2)-agonists in goats.

AB An analytical method based on a QuEChERS procedure (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) has been developed for the determination of mycotoxins (alpha-zearalenol and zearalenone, and aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and G2) in edible oils. The analysis was performed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole analyser (UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS). The method was fully validated and the quantification limit is 0.5 mu g kg(-1) for aflatoxins and 1 mu g kg(-1) for alpha-zearalenol and zearalenone. Suitable recoveries were obtained at low concentration levels (0.5-25 mu g kg(-1) for aflatoxins and 1-25 mu g kg(-1) for alpha-zearalenol and zearalenone), ranging from 80 to 120%. Intra and inter-day precision values were also evaluated and relative standard deviation was lower than 20%. The expanded uncertainty, U, was also evaluated ant it was below 32% at 25 mu g kg(-1). The validated method has been applied to monitor the presence of mycotoxins in 194 samples belonging to different types of edible oils (olive oil, sunflower oil, soy oil and corn oil). Zearalenone was detected in 25% of the analysed samples at concentrations up to 25.6 mu g kg(-1), and aflatoxin G1 and G2 in 3% and 14% of the samples at a maximum concentration of 1.9 and 6.8 mu g kg(-1) respectively.

AB In this study, core-shell lincomycin-imprinted polymers were successfully synthesized and their binding properties evaluated. The functional monomers of methacrylamide and acrylamide were used for synthesis of core and shell, respectively. The optimum synthesized core-shell molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was applied as a sorbet in solid phase extraction cartridge. Afterwards, the method of core-shell molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction (CSMISPE) was used for pre-concentration and clean-up of lincomycin in the milk matrix prior to analysis via high performance liquid chromatography equipped with UV detector (HPLC-UV). The linear range for analysis of lincomycin in the milk matrix using introduced method was obtained from 0.08 to 2 mu g/mL with recovery range of 80%-89%. The limit of detection and limit of quantification were 0.02 mu g/mL and 0.08 mu g/mL, respectively. Finally, calibrated CSMISPE-HPLC-UV method was used for lincomycin residue checking and quantification in the pasteurized milk samples of Mashhad city market.

AB In-situ growth of zeolite imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) on the surface of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) for preparation of porous nanocomposites is a favorable strategy to design potential materials in separation fields. In this research, nanoporous Zn-Al LDH/ZIF-8 composite was prepared by in-situ growth of ZIF-8 on the Zn-Al LDH surface. The nanocomposite was applied for stir bar sorptive extraction and detection of benzylpenicillin (penicillin G, PEN G). Characterizations of the nanocomposite were performed by various techniques, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and thermogravimetric differential thermal analysis. An optimized strategy based on response surface methodology was combined with high performance liquid chromatography analysis. Under the optimized conditions, the limit of detection and quantification obtained were 0.05 and 0.15 mu g l(-1), respectively. The good validation criteria results allowed the method to be used in the quantification of PEN G in real samples.

AB The effect of Pimpinella saxifraga essential oil (PSEO) addition (1-3%) in sodium alginate coating on the bacterial and oxidative stability of cheese was studied during refrigerated storage. The GC-HRMS analysis of PSEO showed that anethole, pseudoisoeugenol and p-anisaldehyde were the main components. The PSEO exhibited strong in vitro DPPH radical scavenging activity (IC50 = 6.81 mu g/mL), beta-carotene bleaching inhibition (IC50 = 206 mu g/mL), ferric reducing power (EC50 = 35.20 mu g/mL), total antioxidant activity (213.96 +/- 11.12 mu mol/mL alpha-tocopherol equivalent) and notable DNA protection potential. Additionally, PSEO displayed potent antibacterial activity against 3 Gram-positive and 3 Gram-negative bacteria (MICs = 0.78-3.12 mg/mL). The acute toxicity of PSEO was determined using mice model (LD50 = 976.2 mg/kg). The enrichment of sodium alginate coating with PSEO, particularly at 3%, improved cheese preservation by reducing the weight loss, preserving the pH and color and enhancing oxidative and bacterial stability without unpleased flavor for consumers.

AB The fungus Leptosphaeria maculans leading to Phoma stem canker (blackleg) of Brassica napus (oilseed rape, canola) produces the phytotoxin sirodesmin PL, which is responsible for major yield losses of oilseed rape worldwide. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) remains the gold standard diagnostic tool for L. maculans, but the required expensive equipment and long time make it inappropriate for fast field test. Herein, a portable system for rapid assaying L. maculans and L. biglobosa is designed around recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) with fluorescent probe as the signal indicator, which allowed the real-time assay of amplification performed on a portable device between 37 and 42 degrees C. The time needed to observe the positive reaction results is controlled within 30 min. The proposed assay system is a good choice for on-site disease screening of oilseed rape plant where rapid detection is valuable, including port quarantine, agriculture quality testing, and pathogen spreading control.

AB The present work investigated the phenolic profiles, antioxidant activities, and cytoprotective effects of the free, esterified, and insoluble-bound phenolic fractions from oil palm fruits treated under ultra-high pressure (UHP). Results showed that UHP treatment significantly increased the total phenolic and flavonoid contents of all three phenolic fractions (p < 0.05). A total of 11 and 12 phenolic compounds were detected and quantified in non-treated and UHP-treated fruits, with caffeic acid having the highest concentration in insoluble-bound phenolic fractions with 8.68 and 11.27 mg/g of dry extract, respectively. The antioxidant activities, intracellular reactive oxygen species inhibition, and cytoprotective effects of all three phenolic fractions were dramatically enhanced after UHP pretreatment (p < 0.05). Therefore, UHP-treated oil palm fruits with increased bioactivities could be used in functional food or the nutraceutical industry to enhance their applications and economic value.

AB Oxidative spoilage is a phenomenon that can occur both in winemaking and during bottle storage. The complexity of oxidative spoilage makes it difficult to identify all the products from oxidation processes, especially in bottled wines with varying degrees of oxidative spoilage, i.e., "random oxidation". To this end, this study sought to obtain a deeper insight into the chemistry of white wine samples to identify compounds able to discriminate the different oxidative statuses. The results of metabolomics and VIP analysis outlined molecules such as 3-methylcatechol, cyanidin 3-O-6"-p-coumaroyl-glucoside, delphinidin 3-O-glucoside, quercetin 3-O-glucosyl-xy-loside, dihydroquercetin, and quercetin 3-O-glucuronide to be discriminant in the detection of the oxidative status of the white wines under study, which were preliminarily classified in low and high oxidation classes by means of sensory analysis. Parameters such as total and free sulfur dioxide content and browning and pinking measurements were confirmed to remain significantly correlated with oxidation-related issues.

AB For the first time, the possibility of using vine-shoots as enological additives, similar to oak chips, is proposed. Their volatile and phenolic compounds contribution to a model wine was studied. Variables such as vine-shoot vinifera (Airen and Cencibel), size (chip and granule), toasting (toasted and non-toasted), dosage (4 and 12 g/L) and maceration time (1, 7, 21, 35 and 120 days) were tested. Results showed an important transference of high-value enological compounds after 35 days of maceration with 12 g/L of toasted vine-shoots. Vanillin or guaiacol were found in concentrations always higher than their wine odor thresholds, depending on the variety and vine-shoot formats used. Moreover, trans-resveratrol and ellagic acid stand out for their high concentrations. This transference rate shows the enological aptitude of vine-shoots with a possibly positive contribution in real wines, both at sensory and functional level, although future studies in real wines must be carried out.

AB A geographical discrimination of honey is an important prerequisite for quality and authenticity control. Here, we present a method based on an NMR-metabolomic analysis of organic extracts for a geographical discrimination of commercial European acacia honeys found on the Italian market. All 234 analysed samples show the characteristic H-1 NMR profile of acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia) honey. However, a PLS2-DA model revealed variations among production zones allowing the successful geographical differentiation with a 100% of overall correct classification rate. Moreover, a PLS2 model is able to predict the proportions in binary blends of Italian and Eastern European acacia honeys. The geographical distinction and the possibility to characterize the content of blends derive from different markers content originating from minor nectar contributions of the acacia-accompanying flora.

AB A new bi-enzymatic catalyst has been produced by precipitation and crosslinking (combi-CLEAs) of beta-galacto-sidase and glucose isomerase for catalyzing the cascade reactions of lactose conversion into fructose, producing a lactose-fructose syrup (LFS). Glucose isomerase was chemically aminated to increase its reactive surface groups for favour the crosslinking step. The effect of beta-galactosidase to glucose isomerase activity ratio and glutaraldehyde to protein mass ratio in combi-CLEAs production was evaluated. The selected combi-catalyst was successfully used in the production of fructose syrup from lactose in a single reaction vessel. The biocatalyst could be used at least in five sequential batches of LFS production, remaining fully stable after a total of 50 h of reaction, obtaining a product of constant quality. A robust bi-enzymatic catalyst was produced that can be repeatedly used in LFS production, an attractive mild sweetener for the dairy food industry.

AB The effects of lipid composition, crystallization temperature, Solid fat content (SFC), microstructure on the rheological properties of blends of fully hydrogenated palm kernel oil (FHPKO) or fully hydrogenated coconut oil (FHCNO) with rapeseed oil (RSO) in the range of 20-100% were investigated using small and large deformation rheology. The variation of chemical composition, crystallization temperature (5-30 degrees C), SFC of the blends resulted in different rheological properties. Shear modulus was positive correlation with the content of saturated fatty acid of the sample. The storage modulus (G') and yield force increased with the addition of FHPKO or FHCNO and were dramatically influenced by SFC and crystallization temperature. The values of G' in FHPKO/RSO blends were higher than those of corresponding FHCNO/RSO blends. Combined analysis of SFC and microstructure related to rheological behavior revealed that smaller average crystal diameter, higher SFC and higher fractal dimension led to higher storage modulus of fat crystal networks.

AB Monoclonal antibody-based techniques have become a useful analytical technology in the agro-food sector. Nowadays, residues of the recently registered fungicide fluopyram are increasingly being found in quality control programs. In the present study, novel chemical derivatives of this pesticide were prepared and specific and high-affinity monoclonal antibodies to fluopyram were raised for the first time. Moreover, immunoassays to fluopyram were developed in two alternative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay formats, using homologous and heterologous assay conjugates, with limits of detection below 0.05 mu g L-1. The optimized immunoassays were applied to the analysis of fluopyram in fortified plums and grapes of four different varieties as well as in in-house prepared musts and wines. Recoveries were between 76.3% and 109.6% and coefficients of variation were below 20%. Quantification limits were well below the maximum residue limits. Immunoassay performance was statistically validated with a reference chromatographic technique using samples from fluopyram-treated plum and grape cultivars.

AB The effects of genotype, agro-climatic conditions (ACC), and cooking method as well as their interactions on the content of individual carotenoids and hydroxycinnamic acids in different potato tubers were evaluated. While zeaxanthin content was highly influenced by the ACC (up to 631-fold change), chlorogenic acid was similarly influenced by the cooking method (up to 3.1-fold increase after cooking), by the interactions ACC x cooking method (up to 2.1-fold increase) and genotypexcooking method (up to 1.7-fold increase). Stability/extractability of compounds after cooking was found to be genotype and ACC dependent, which suggest that genotype and ACC induces differential expression of genes for the biosynthesis pathways of carotenoids and hydroxycinnamic acids is different among, as well as components of the cellular matrix. These results are promising to apply in potato breeding programs with the perspective to develop new potato cultivars selected by their nutritional attributes.

AB Curcumin loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticle (SBA-15) was incorporated into chitosan (CS) film to improve the functional properties of pure CS film. Curcumin was loaded into SBA-15 (SBA-15-Cur) through a rotavapor method. The structural properties of SBA-15-Cur were characterised in detail by small-angle X-ray scattering, fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and N-2 adsorption-desorption analyses. The CS/SBA-15-Cur bionanocomposite film was prepared by solvent casting. The mechanical properties of the bionanocomposite film were improved by the addition of the SBA-15-Cur nanofiller, as revealed by the FT-IR analysis of the biocomposite film. However, the water vapour permeability of the films was not significantly influenced by the filler. Release studies suggested that the CS/SBA-15-Cur bionanocomposite film exhibited pH-responsive and sustained release behaviour of curcumin. The CS/SBA-15-Cur film demonstrated efficient antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. These data indicated that the CS/SBA-15-Cur bionanocomposite film could be a promising active food packaging material.

AB Avocado (Persea americana) is a tropical fruit that has drawn great interest its oil for foods and cosmetic industries; however, avocado oil processing by-product is a potential source of edible protein. Herein, edible protein was prepared from defatted avocado meal, and it's physicochemical, functional and emulsion properties were investigated. The avocado protein showed U-shaped exhibiting strong effect of pH, and a minimum solubility being observed at pH 4.5, confirming the isoelectric point of avocado protein. Nutritionally, the avocado protein contains all the essential amino acids. Avocado protein provided higher water and oil absorption capacities, higher radical scavenging capacity but lower in-vitro digestibility compared with soy protein. Furthermore, the avocado protein as emulsifier afforded a stability oil-in-water emulsion system, resulting in a greater emulsifying stability than that of soy protein. The present results highlight the potential source of edible protein from avocado oil processing by-products for functional food ingredients.

AB The complex nature of human breast milk (HBM) makes samples difficult to analyze, requiring several extraction techniques and analytical platforms to obtain high metabolome coverage. In this work, we combined liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and solid-phase extraction (SPE) techniques to prepare HBM samples to overcome the challenge of low-and high-abundance lipid species, enabling the semiquantitative analysis of total HBM lipids in one liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) run. A nonorganic fraction obtained during the LLE step was used to analyze small polar metabolites. This analytical approach allows extensive metabolome coverage, especially for low-abundance glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. The method was applied to monitor short-term metabolome changes in HBM composition within individual mothers and the results showed variable metabolite composition patterns. Simultaneous detection of high-abundance glycerolipids and low-abundance but not less significant phospholipids in one LC-MS run saves time, decreases cost, and enables comprehensive insight into the dynamics of HBM composition.

AB In this work we studied the stability of phytosterols in oil matrix under photooxidation (with different light intensity, existence/absence of photosensitizers and unsaturated lipids). Results revealed that the photooxidation of phytosterols fit a first order kinetic model (R-2 > 0.96). When the intensity of light was higher, the rate constants increased and phytosterols oxidized faster. The progress could be also accelerated by photosensitizers, whereas the unsaturated matrix inhibited the formation of oxidation products. Phytosterols oxidation products (POPs) were detected in all model matrix samples. 7 beta-hydroxy was the main oxidation products in most cases during the whole treatment under light, which represented about one third of the total phytosterol oxides, followed by 7 alpha-hydroxy, 5 beta, 6 beta-epoxy, 7-keto, 5 alpha, 6 alpha-epoxy and 6 beta-hydroxy. And the oxidation at C7 on the Ring B of steroid nucleus was the most important pathway of phytosterols photooxidation.

AB An excess of nitrogen (N) is used in agriculture endangering the environment and food quality. One approach to circumvent this is to generate crops with a stable or even increased productivity under limited N. Here, we studied the effect of reduced N availability on potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber yield and quality traits using five varieties: the wild Andigena and the commercial cultivars Desiree, Milva, Saturna and Alegria. Growth on limited N resulted in less tubers with a reduced weight except for Andigena. Tubers from low N-grown plants contained more starch, less sucrose and were delayed in sprouting. Some of the trait differences can be explained by changes in hormone levels between cultivars and N conditions. In general, Saturna and Alegria performed better under limited N making them excellent breeding candidates. Our results suggest that wild species more flexibly adapt to limited N, a trait lost in commercial potatoes.

AB The current study was designed to characterize the metabolite profile and bioactivity of two commercial bitter melon (Momordica charantia Linn.) genotypes. UPLC-high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was used to identify 15 phenolic and 46 triterpenoids in various bitter melon extracts. Total phenolic levels were the highest (57.28 +/- 1.02) in methanolic extract of the inner tissue of Indian Green cultivar, which also correlated to the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity (30.48 +/- 2.49 ascorbic acid equivalents (mg of AAE)/g of FD). In addition, highest levels of total saponins were observed in chloroform extract of the Chinese bitter melon pericarp (75.73 mg +/- 4.67 diosgenin equivalents (DE)/g of FD). Differential inhibition of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase activity was observed in response to polarity of extract, cultivar and tissue type. These results suggest that consumption of whole bitter melon may have potential health benefits to manage diabetes.

AB In this study, the activity, expression and localization of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) was investigated in beef semimembranosus muscle (SM) during postmortem aging. Five beef SM muscles were vacuum-packaged and aged for 1, 3, 7 and 14 d at 4 degrees C. Results showed that SM muscle retained NOS activity during the 14 d storage period. Compared to 1 d of storage, NOS activity and neuronal NOS (nNOS) content decreased significantly at 3 and 7 d (P < 0.05). Calpain played a major role in degrading nNOS during beef postmortem aging. In addition, immunofluorescence studies suggested that nNOS in beef SM muscle was mainly distributed in the sarcolemma. The S-nitrosothiol (SNO) content in SM muscle increased significantly at 1, 3 and 7 d post-slaughter. This manuscript is the first study to demonstrate the activity and expression of NOS in beef during postmortem aging.

AB Tea is one of the most consumed beverages in the word. Here we report the concentrations of metals and phthalates in 32 commercial tea packages. The data were used to estimate the average daily intake of metals and phthalates, and associated Hazard Quotients (HQ) were calculated in order to determine risk of non-cancerous health effects for adults consuming tea on a daily basis. Tea samples were chosen based on the sales network, the price, the marketing quality and the presence of filters in the packages. Relatively high median concentrations of Al (5240 mu g/L), Ni (44 mu g/L), and Mn (2919 mu g/L) were detected. No metals or phthalates quantified in the tea infusions and soluble tea showed an HQ greater than 1, indicating no risk of non-cancerous health effects. The data presented herein may serve as a starting point to evaluate tolerance limits of metals and phthalate in the tea infusion.

AB The objective of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of lysozyme coatings and 1-MCP on storage and preservation of kiwifruit stored at 4 +/- 1 degrees C and 90-95% RH for 20 d. Ethylene production, respiratory rate, decay incidence, weight loss, firmness, chlorophyll, soluble solid, titratable acid, ascorbic acid, total bacterial count, ascorbate peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity of treated kiwifruit were examined. The results showed that lysozyme coatings or 1-MCP treatment inhibited ethylene production and respiratory rate, delayed the increase of decay incidence, weight loss, soluble solid and total bacterial count, improved firmness, chlorophyll, titratable acid, ascorbic acid content, APX, SOD and CAT activity during the storage compared with the untreated kiwifruit in different degree. Moreover, the combined effect of lysozyme coatings and 1-MCP was more excellent than that of lysozyme coatings or 1-MCP alone. In conclusion, our present results indicated that the combined treatment of lysozyme coatings and 1-MCP may be an efficient way to improve the postharvest quality and prolong the shelf life of kiwifruit.

AB Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) is a rich source of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Its post-harvest deterioration leads to a limited shelf-life up to 5-7 days. To avoid such loss, the present study investigates the potential effect of starch glucose (SG) coating on the extension of its shelf-life, after harvest. 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mu M of starch with 2.5 mu M D-glucose solutions were coated over freshly harvested cucumbers and stored at refrigerated temperature (+/- 4 degrees C) for 30 days. 1.5 mu M starch plus 2.5 mu M D-glucose displayed significantly better results as per the skin colour and sensory evaluation test. This level of SG coating extended the shelf-life of cucumbers up to 30 days with least reduction in weight loss, total soluble sugar, protein, catalase activity, peroxidase activity and increased in proline content, 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl antioxidant activities and ferrous ion chelating activities.

AB Du-zhong brick tea (DBT), a new post-fermented functional tea, is marketed in China for its prevention of diseases from oxidative stress. However, antioxidant compounds in DBT are not clear. Here, a novel online extraction-HPLC-ferric reducing antioxidant power (OLE-HPLC-FRAP) has been developed to screen antioxidants in DBT. For OLE, guard column is packed with DBT (1.0 mg), then compounds are extracted directly by HPLC mobile phase for HPLC-FRAP analysis without sample pretreatment procedures. Eleven antioxidants have been screened and identified, three of which are detected in Du-zhong for the first time. Contributions of eleven antioxidant compounds to total antioxidant activity are evaluated using chlorogenic acid as antioxidant marker. Results indicate that the developed OLE-HPLC-FRAP system is a simple and powerful tool to analyze antioxidant compounds from solid complex mixtures, which also contribute to the enhancement of the value of DBT as a good functional tea.

AB Fifteen phenolic compounds were determined in rice grains by ultrasound assisted extraction and ultra-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection. Primarily, an UAE method has been developed and validated for the extraction of phenolics from rice grains. For the optimization, a Box-Behnken Design based on six factors including extraction temperature (10-70 degrees C), solvent composition (0-50% methanol in water), cycle (0.2-0.7 s(-1)), ultrasound amplitude (30-70%), and solvent to sample ratio (2.5:1 to 5:1) was employed. Multi-response optimization (MRO) was performed to develop a simultaneous extraction method of 15 phenolics. The optimal UAE conditions were: extraction temperature 45 degrees C, time 25 min, cycle 0.4 s(-1), ultrasound amplitude 47%, solvent composition 80% methanol in water at pH 4.25, and sample to solvent ratio 1:5. Linearity, LODs, LOQs, precision and recovery were determined. In addition, the method was successfully applied to analyse a number of rice samples with different varieties.

AB For the very first time, this study investigates the simultaneous migration of several metals and bisphenol compounds from coated tinplate cans into vegetable foods highly consumed worldwide. The role played by heat treatment, food type and brand, storage conditions, can denting and cooking food directly in cans is also assessed. Migration of bisphenol compounds (only BPA and BADGE center dot 2H(2)O detected) was mainly affected by sterilization, whereas metal release was greatly influenced by storage. Based on a Principal Component Analysis different migration pattern groups were highlighted: BPA and Zn (and Pb to a lesser extent) showed similar migration trends, with dependence on food type, brand and storage temperature. Cd, Ni and Cu were similarly influenced by food type and can brand. Fe has a particular trend, with clear influence of storage time, and to a lesser extent of food type. Overall Fe and BADGE center dot 2H(2)O migration were favored in acidic food.

AB This study aimed to investigate the cryoprotective activities of antifreeze glycopeptide analogues (GAPP) obtained by nonenzymatic glycation and explore the mechanism of GAPP on Streptococcus thermophilus during cold stress. Results showed that the survivability of S. thermophilus increased from 32.03% to 92.56% treated with 5 mg/mL GAPP. The glass transition temperature of GAPP increased from -27.6 to -21.4 degrees C after nonenzymatic glycation. The thermal hysteresis activity of GAPP was significantly higher and the amount of ice nuclei in GAPP groups was lower than that of BSA and antifreeze peptides. GAPP could significantly inhibit the leakage of intracellular proteins and nucleic acids, and prevent the decrease of beta-galactosidase and lactic dehydrogenase activities. Cells disruption and contents leakage could be observed in control groups, while cells with GAPP maintained satiation and integrity. The results suggested that GAPP could be potentially developed as a new and effective probiotics cryoprotectant in frozen food system.

AB The addition of potassium ferrocyanide (K-4[Fe(CN)(6)]) in table salt as anti-caking agent has a crucial role in preventing the formation of lumps. However, the excess of K-4[Fe(CN)(6)] and its decomposers are harmful to both human health and environment. To date, there are still lack of suitable methods for simple and rapid analysis of K-4[Fe(CN)(6)] in table salt and salted food. Herein, a novel fluorescent Si QDs probe for sensitive, selective and rapid detection of K-4[Fe(CN)(6)] was synthesized by facile one-step strategy. Notably, the fluorescence of Si QDs could be remarkably quenched by K-4[Fe(CN)(6)] via electrostatic interaction. Based on this phenomenon, a new method of determination of K-4[Fe(CN)(6)] was established. A wide linear range was obtained from 0.05 to 8.0 mu g/mL with a detection limit of 30 ng/mL. The established fluorescent new method was suitable for detecting K-4[Fe(CN)(6)] in table salt and salted food samples with satisfactory results.

AB The effect of elicitation with arachidonic and jasmonic acids on the production of phenolic compounds as well as the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of phenolic extracts of wheatgrass was evaluated. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of phenolic compounds carried out with the UPLC-MS technique indicated that luteolin and apigenin derivatives were the dominant flavonoids, while ferulic acid derivatives and syringic acid were the main components in the phenolic acid fraction in the wheatgrass. No qualitative changes in the examined phenolic compounds were observed in the case of the control and elicited plants, while there was an increase in the content of some compounds. The antioxidant activity increased in the elicited samples (with the exception of reducing power) and this elevation was partially correlated with the increase in the polyphenol content in the studied plants. Elicitation with 0.01 mu M arachidonic acid also caused improvement of potential anti-inflammatory properties of the wheatgrass.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of Raman spectroscopy to identify the genotype of green coffee beans. Four genotypes of Arabic coffee: one Mundo Novo line (G1) and three Bourbon lines (G2, G3, and G4). The harvest was selected using a wet processing method. Raman spectra of the samples were obtained using a FT-Raman RFS/100 spectrometer in the spectral range of 3500-400 cm(-1). The data were treated using chemometric unsupervised classification tools and supervised analysis. Using the unsupervised analysis (PCA), the apparent tendency of agglomeration between samples G1 and G3 was verified. These differences were present in the spectral bands that are characteristic of fatty acids and kahweol. Based on this information, a classification model to discriminate (PLS-DA) the Mundo Novo and Bourbon samples was utilized. Raman spectroscopy allowed the building of an adequate model to differentiate between coffee genotypes.

AB The allergenicity suppression of tropomyosin (TM) from Exopalaemon modestus by glycation with saccharides of different molecular sizes (glucose, maltose, maltotriose, maltopentaose and maltoheptaose) was investigated using immunoblotting, human colon epithelial cell line (Caco-2) and human basophil cell line (KU812). Glycation of TM by glucose, maltotriose, maltopentaose and maltoheptaose significantly destructed and masked TM epitopes to obtain lower allergenicity, while glycation of TM by maltose had insignificant suppression on TM allergenicity. In addition, the glycated TM by glucose, maltotriose, maltopentaose and maltoheptaose inhibited the proliferation and IL-8 secretion of Caco-2, and the CD63 and CD203c expression, MAPK signaling of KU812 basophils, while the glycated TM by maltose had insignificant suppression on the allergy reactivities of Caco-2 cells and KU812 basophils. Glycation of TM by saccharides with larger molecular sizes (such as maltoheptaose) could provide new insight into the desensitization of shrimp-induced food allergy.

AB A methylglyoxal (MG)-beta-lactoglobulin (bLG) model was established to simulate reheating conditions (60-100 degrees C) to investigate the modification effect that alpha-dicarbonyl compounds had on protein structure and on the digestibility of milk protein. The results showed that bLG can be modified by MG, and the modification degree increased with the increase in reheating temperature. The reacted lysine and arginine as well as the generated protein-bound N-epsilon-carboxymethyllysine and N-epsilon-carboxyethyllysine in the modified bLG also increased with temperature. The high-resolution mass spectrometry results revealed that the modification site is at the lysine and arginine residue of bLG. Additionally, nine types of modifications were detected, and N-epsilon-carboxyethyllysine was the dominant modification product. The in vitro digestibility of MG-modified bLG clearly decreased with the increase in reheating temperature. This result was consistent with the degree of structural modification and could be explained by the specific action sites (lysine and arginine) of the digestive enzyme, which were modified by MG.

AB Starch, one of the most important components of coarse grains, has received widespread attention because of its prominent potential health benefits. In the present study, we isolated starches from the grains of sorghum, tartary buckwheat, common buckwheat, mungbean, and pea and studied their structural and physicochemical properties. These five starches all showed the distinctive "Maltese cross" effect (birefringence) but significantly differed in morphology, size, and complexity of granules. Sorghum starch exhibited the lowest amylose content and highest weight-average molar mass. Mungbean contained more short amylopectin [degree of polymerization (DP) 612 = 23.4%]. Pea starch exhibited the highest amylose content, highest amylopectin average chain length, and lowest weight-average molar mass. The starches of sorghum, tartary buckwheat, and common buckwheat showed A-type crystallinity, whereas those of mungbean and pea showed C-type crystallinity. Our results provide useful information for the application of coarse grain starches in diverse industries.

AB Potato starch was pre-treated with CaCl2 solutions prior to modification with octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA). Starch pre-treated with 1.0 M CaCl2 showed higher degree of substitution (DS) and reaction efficiency (RE) on OSA modification, whereas pre-treatment with CaCl2 solutions at 0.05 M, 0.1 M and 0.5 M had no effect on DS and RE. CaCl2 pre-treatment decreased the swelling power, paste clarity, peak viscosity (PV), breakdown (BD) and some textural parameters of potato starch, with the effects being greater at higher concentrations of CaCl2 . Pre-treatment with 1.0 M CaCl2 caused a small disruption to starch crystallinity and granule morphology. OSA modification significantly decreased the textural parameters, PV, BD, relative crystallinity, swelling power, gelatinization temperatures and enthalpy of potato starch, but it increased the paste clarity and emulsifying activity. OSA-1.0 M-starch showed improved functional properties over OSA-starch, indicating that CaCl2 pre-treatment provides advantages for improving the functional characters of succinylated starch.

AB Physicochemical properties, cooking time, and phenolics profile of two black rice genotypes grown at six different locations in Brazil were determined. The cultivar IAC 600 and the elite-line AE 153045 were used. The main growing locations for black rice were considered, as follows: Alegrete (ALG), Capao do Leao (CPL), Guaratingueta (GUA), Roseira (ROS), Santa Vitoria do Palmar (SVP), and Taubate (TBT). Principal component analysis (PCA) and supervised partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) from liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data sets showed distinction among genotypes and locations. Quercetin-3-O-glucoside and vanillic acid were the most relevant compounds for discriminating genotypes. SVP location provided the most distinctive black rice, with greater total phenolics content. Characteristics of black rice from SVP location were associated to effects of latitude and wind conditions. Hesperetin, vanillic acid, quercetion-3-O-glucoside, and p-coumaric acid were the most relevant compounds for discriminating locations.

AB Health benefits are routinely attributed to whey proteins, their hydrolysates and peptides based on in vitro chemical and cellular assays. The objective of this study was to track the fate of whey proteins through the upper gastrointestinal tract, their uptake across the intestinal barrier and then assess the physiological impact to downstream target cells. Simulated gastrointestinal digestion (SGID) released a selection of whey peptides some of which were transported across a Caco-2/HT-29 intestinal barrier, inhibited free radical formation in muscle and liver cells. In addition, SGID of beta-lactoglobulin resulted in the highest concentration of free amino acids (176 nM) arriving on the basolateral side of the co-culture with notable levels of branched chain and sulphur-containing amino acids. In vitro results indicate that consumption of whey proteins will deliver bioactive peptides to target cells.

AB The dual separation in gas chromatographyion mobility spectrometry generates complex multi-dimensional data, whose interpretation is a challenge. In this work, two chemometric approaches for olive oil classification are compared to get the most robust model over time: i) an non-targeted fingerprinting analysis, in which the overall GCIMS data was processed and ii) a targeted approach based on peak-region features (markers). A total of 701 olive samples from two harvests (2014-2015 and 2015-2016) were analysed and processed by both approaches. The models built with data samples of 2014-2015 showed that both approaches were suitable for samples classification (success > 74%). However, when these models were applied for classifying samples from 2015-2016, better values were obtained using markers. The combination of data from the two harvests to build the chemometric models improved the percentages of success (> 90%). These results confirm the potential of GCIMS-based approaches for olive oil classification.

AB Nutrient content and digestibility as well as factors with a potentially negative effect on these parameters were studied in legume sprouts enriched with L. plantarum 299v. The nutrient digestibility and contents were not strongly affected by the co-culture of the probiotic and sprouts. The highest digestibility of starch was observed for adzuki bean preparations (from 91.6% to 95.5%), while the lowest value was noted for soybean preparations (from 49.6% to 60.8%). A slight decrease in starch digestibility was observed in adzuki and soybean sprouts enriched with the probiotic (by about 5% and 7% respectively). An increase in starch digestibility was noted in lentil and mung bean sprouts. A key influence on protein digestibility was exerted by the activity of trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitors. Generally, there was no negative effect of the studied factors on starch digestibility. Most importantly, the control and probiotic-rich sprouts retained high quality after cold storage.

AB Since commonly used texture profile analysis (TPA) depend on gas volume fraction, a detailed development of mechanistic relationships between firming-relevant additives and structural crumb matrix alterations often fail. Thus, a method to prepare gas-free crumb pellets was developed to exclude porosity effects. Therefore, reference white bread crumb was freeze-dried, crushed and rehydrated with either distilled water or maltose solution to the native moisture content. Freeze-dried crumb matrix, rehydrated after baking with maltose solution (0.5 g maltose/100 g flour), did not retard firming in comparison to reference pellets (crumb matrix rehydrated with water). Thus, maltose showed no functionality on pellet firming during storage. However, crumb pellets exhibited a reduced firmness, when maltose was added during dough preparation resulting in an altered crumb formation. Additionally, results demonstrated, that differences between leavening methods (chemical vs. biological) on firming kinetics were not significant, which was confirmed by comparable Avrami firming rates k.

AB This study determined effects of different black pepper levels (5, 10 or 15 g kg(-1)), sodium ascorbate usage and cooking level (raw, medium, medium well and well done) on nitrosamine formation in sucuk (a kind of dry fermented sausage). Sodium ascorbate decreased residual nitrite considerably. Cooking level had a very significant effect on nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) and nitrosopiperidine (NPIP) contents. NPIP content increased in sucuk both with and without ascorbate, as cooking level increased. High black pepper level decreased NPIP content in both raw and well done samples. The use of 15 g kg(-1) black pepper level caused an increase in both NDMA and NPYR contents in the absence of ascorbate. In contrast, the combination of ascorbate and 15 g kg(-1) black pepper resulted in a decrease in NPYR.

AB The objective of this study is to report a molecularly imprinted polymer-based chemiluminescence method for determination of Sudan dyes. A dummy-template molecularly imprinted polymer capable of recognizing seven Sudan dyes was first synthesized and its recognition mechanism was studied by using computation simulation method. The polymer was coated in the wells of conventional microplate to prepare a chemiluminescence sensor and the assay process consisted of only one sample-loading step prior to signal acquisition. The optimized sensor was used to determine the seven dyes in egg yolk and the results were confirmed with a high performance liquid chromatography. Results showed that this sensor achieved ultrahigh sensitivity (1.0-5.0 pg/mL), rapid assay process (10 min) and satisfactory recovery (70.5%-92.2%). Furthermore, the sensor could be reused for 5 times. Therefore, this sensor could be used as a useful tool for screening the residues of Sudan dyes in egg.

AB Structural changes of chemically modified rice starch (CMRS) by one-step reactive extrusion (REX) via esterification, acetylation, hydroxypropylation, and cross-linking or dual-modification (hydroxypropylation-cross-linking and acetylation-cross-linking) were investigated. REX treatments exhibited a significant effect on the structure of rice starch granules, resulting in the destruction of the starch crystalline structure and formation of new crystalline complexes. The original A-type crystalline structure was transformed to VH-type after REX treatments, which were further confirmed by DSC experiments since a new endotherm at 100-122 degrees C was detected. Due to the susceptibility differences in shear-induced breakdown of amylopectin and amylose, the molecular degradation was heterogeneous and retarded by esterification but enhanced by cross-linking. Morphology analysis showed that the original starch granular structure was lost and replaced with a rougher and more irregular structure. In consequence, REX process exerted significant influences on rice starch granules which enhanced its resistance to enzyme hydrolysis.

AB High-performance ion-exchange chromatography with suppressed conductivity (HPIEC-SCD) was validated for the determination of nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-) in the edible part of diverse seafood species. Samples analyzed by HPIEC-SCD that were devoid of nitrite and nitrate were subjected to HRMS using a Q-exactive Orbitrap platform. As NO2- is not detectable in Q-Exactive Orbitrap, it was necessary to perform the oxidation of NO2- to NO3-. Accordingly, suitability of NO2- oxidation by H2O2 as a part of sample preparation for HPIEC-HRMS was elaborated. The difference in the concentration of NO3- before and after H2O2 treatment was used for the evaluation of eventual NO2- presence. The edible part of 53 fish, shrimp and bivalve species presented significant differences in NO3- levels especially between farmed (median = 44 mu g/g) and wild species (median = 16 mu g/g). The highest concentration of NO3- was found in smoked salmon samples (median = 60 mu g/g) while NO2- was not revealed in any of the samples studied.

AB Exogenous Ca2+ affects the phenolic metabolism and physiological indices of germinated wheat under ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation, but the mechanism is unclear. The current study applied exogenous Ca2+ and Ca2+ channel blocker LaCl3 to the germinated wheat under UV-B radiation to unravel the role of Ca2+. The results indicated that total phenolic content (TPC) of the 4-day germinated wheat under UV-B radiation with CaCl2 (UV+B+Ca) treatment significantly increased by 10.3% as compared to the UV-B treatment. Gene expression levels of p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase, cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase and caffeic acid O-methyltransferase were positively correlated with the content of ferulic and p-coumaric acids, respectively. Exogenous Ca2+ could significantly alleviate the membrane lipid peroxidation, activate the antioxidant enzymes and regulate the phytohormone level under UV-B radiation. This study suggested that exogenous Ca2+ participated in the phenolic metabolism and physiological regulation in germinated wheat under UV-B radiation.

AB The chemical oxidation of white wines through the Fenton reaction has been widely studied, wherein the primary species is the hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-.). This radical possesses high oxidising power and may oxidise the primary components in wines. The Fenton reaction in wines is complex and includes the participation of phenolic compounds, organic acids, and metals. However, there has been no systematic study to date that relates wine composition to (OH)-O-. production in real white wines.
   In this paper, a multivariate model was generated using the partial least squares (PLS) algorithm, and linear correlations were established between wine composition and (OH)-O-. production. Based on the results, the variables were classified as either pro-oxidants (malic acid, p-coumaric acid, and caffeic acid, % prodelphinidins, procyanidins B1, Mn, Cu, and Zn) or antioxidants (cis-piceid, ellagic acid, gallic acid, proanthocyanins, glucose, and proton concentration). Finally, the pathways by which wine compounds participate in (OH)-O-. production are discussed.

AB Two anthocyanins from purple-fleshed sweet potato were isolated and characterized by LC-MS and NMR analysis. They were identified as peonidin-3-(6'-hydroxybenzoyl)-sophoroside-5-glucoside and peonidin-3-(6'-hydroxybenzoyl- 6 ''-caffeoyl)-sophoroside-5-glucoside. The acid-base dynamics of these acylated anthocyanins was evaluated by means of pH jump techniques. Equilibrium and kinetic constants were determined and, in general, these anthocyanins demonstrated a higher capacity in retaining the red and blue colors at acidic and basic pH values, suggesting a higher resistance to pH variations compared to the parent anthocyanin, peonidin-3-Oglucoside. The presence of acyl groups and additional glucoside moieties seems to determine this particular characteristic. The fluorescence properties of these anthocyanins were evaluated. Overall, the species present at higher pH values (7-9) showed higher fluorescence intensity for both anthocyanins, with an optimum lambda(ex)/lambda(em) pair at lambda(ex) 610 nm/lambda(em) 640 nm. The fluorescence characteristics of these anthocyanins were used to evaluate their location in gastric and intestinal cells by fluorescence microscopy.

AB The inhibition of human pancreatic alpha-amylase (HPA) enzyme activity can offer facile routes to ameliorate postprandial hyperglycemia in diabetes via control of starch digestion. The present study utilizes complementary experimental (starch digestion kinetics, fluorescence quenching, Forster resonance energy transfer and X-ray diffraction) and computational (molecular docking and dynamics simulation) methods to evaluate the HPA inhibitory activity of eight water-soluble vitamins, for the first time. In particular, ascorbic acid inhibited HPA activity via non-competitive antagonism from two allosteric sites, by channeling the inhibition towards the active site cavity via the triose-phosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel. In contrast, folic acid inhibited HPA activity by binding competitively to the active site cavity and decreasing the disorder in the neighboring loops 3 and 7, which are important mobile loops in HPA for starch digestion. The infusion of such biocompatible and nutritional water-soluble vitamins alongside starch may offer new avenues for diabetes management.

AB The effects of malondialdehyde (MDA) as a byproduct of lipid oxidation on myoglobin and myofibrillar proteins (MP) oxidations in muscle homogenates containing components native to rabbit muscle were investigated. For myoglobin, MDA could lead to increase in metmyoglobin percentage. For MP, MDA could promote protein carbonylation and loss of tryptophan fluorescence. In addition, MDA could affect reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating system by promoting the formation of hypervalent myoglobin species and release of non-heme iron. The result of MDA-MP adducts fluorescence intensity indicated that ROS-generating systems may be the main reason for protein carbonylation at the later of incubation treatment. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the ability of ROS-generating systems to facilitate protein oxidation was enhanced with MDA, which was responsible for the formation of protein cross-linking throughout incubation treatment. Taken together, the ability of MDA on promoting the oxidation of MP in rabbit muscle homogenates may be relied on both adduct reactions and the influence on ROS-generating system.

AB An accurate high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) method is presented to measure the inhibition property of flavonoids against mammalian starch digestive enzymes, because flavonoids interfere with commonly used 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) and glucose oxidase/peroxidase (GOPOD) methods. Eriodictyol, luteolin, and quercetin increased absorbance values (without substrate) in the DNS assay and, with substrate, either overestimated or underestimated values in the DNS and GOPOD assays. Using a direct HPAEC measurement method, flavonoids showed different inhibition properties against alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidases, showing different inhibition constants (K-i) and mechanisms. The double bond between C2 and C3 on the C-ring of flavonoids appeared particularly important to inhibit alpha-amylase, while the hydroxyl group (OH) at C3 of the C-ring was related to inhibition of alpha-glucosidases. This study shows that direct measurement of starch digestion products by HPAEC should be used in inhibition studies, and provides insights into structure-function aspects of polyphenols in controlling starch digestion rate.

AB Maca (Lepidium meyenii Walpers) has emerged as a popular functional plant food due to various claimed health effects. This review details the major (i.e., starch, dietary fiber, and protein) and minor constituents (i.e., minerals, non-starch polysaccharides, polyphenols (flavonolignans), macaenes, macamides, glucosinolates, and alkaloids) of maca (root and aerial parts). Diverse health effects of maca are also summarized. Various bioactivities of maca include enhanced reproductive health, antifatigue, antioxidation, neuroprotection, antimicrobial activity, anticancer, hepatoprotection, immunomodulation, and improving skin health and digestive system's function. Plant genetics, botanical parts, processing, extraction, and experimental protocols represent the major factors affecting the chemical composition, physicochemical attributes, and health effects of maca-based products. However, clinical studies to support the claimed health effects of maca and related mechanisms appear to be lacking. Product innovation and diversification in food and non-food utilization of different parts of maca to maximize the value perceptions are suggested.

AB Background: Genome-wide association studies have captured a large proportion of genetic variation related to type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). However, most of these studies are performed in populations of European ancestry and therefore the disease risk estimations can be inaccurate when extrapolated to other world populations.
   Methods: We conducted a case-control study in 1866 individuals from the three major populations of the Republic of Bashkortostan (Russians, Tatars, and Bashkirs) in Russian Federation, using single-locus and multilocus approach to identify genetic predictors of T1D.
   Results: We found that LTA rs909253 and TNF rs1800629 polymorphisms were associated with T1D in the group of Tatars. Meta-analysis of the association study results in the three ethnic groups has confirmed the association between the T1D risk and LTA rs909253 genetic variant. LTA rs909253 and TNF rs1800629 loci were also featured in combinations most significantly associated with T1D.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that LTA rs909253 and TNF rs1800629 polymorphisms are associated with the risk of T1D both independently and in combination with polymorphic markers in other inflammatory genes, and the analysis of multi-allelic combinations provides valuable insight in the study of polygenic traits.

AB Background: Cholestatic liver disease (CLD) is a highly heterogeneous hepatobiliary disease with various causes. The purpose of this research was to explore the gene expression changes throughout the course of CLD revealing potential causative molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets.
   Methods: We established two animal models of cholestasis: 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine feeding for 2, 4 and 6 weeks and bile duct ligation for 14 days. Using these two models, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by RNA-Seq analysis and used the newly-found knowledge of DEGs in comprehensive bioinformatic analyses to investigate key molecular events. Sequencing results were confirmed by experimental verification.
   Results: Our study detected overlapping DEGs in the two models, of these 568 genes were upregulated and 117 genes were downregulated. Gene Ontology analysis demonstrated that the upregulated genes were associated with the biological processes of cell adhesion, cell migration and cell motility, while the metabolic processes of various substances were enriched for the downregulated genes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed that the upregulated pathways were mainly distributed in focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction and amoebiasis, while downregulated pathways focused on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathway, metabolic pathways and primary bile acid biosynthesis. These findings were further confirmed by protein-protein interaction network modeling. Hub genes Src, Pdgfb, Coll Sal, Mmp9, Egfr were selected using centralities analyses and verified by qRT-PCR.
   Conclusion: We profiled a global mRNA landscape in CLD to promote a complete understanding of transcriptomic events of this disease, offering candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the clinic.

AB Reinforcing the immunity of pregnant sows can not only improve their own health condition but also increase the survival rate and healthy status of their piglets. This study aims to find single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and molecular markers that are associated with the immune traits of pregnant sows. SLA-DOB and CD4 were selected as candidate genes, and blood samples were randomly collected from pregnant Landrace sows and used to detect T-lymphocyte subsets, interferon alpha, interleukin 6, Toll-like receptor 3, serum antibody immunoglobulin G, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus-specific antibody. Then, association analyses were conducted for the polymorphic sites of candidate genes with immune traits. We found 12 mutations in the two genes and conducted an association study with eight of them. Our results indicated that among the eight mutations, SNP1, SNP2, and SNP3 of the SLA-DOB gene and Ins9, SNP10, and SNP11 in the CD4 gene are newly discovered mutations. Except for SNP1, SNP3, and SNP11, the other five SNPs are associated with at least one immune trait tested. Especially, SNP2 and Ins9 are significantly associated with at least one of the T-lymphocyte subgroups and at least one antibody. These novel mutations have potential important effects on the polymorphic loci of the above immune traits in pregnant sows. The results suggest that the SLA-DOB and CD4 genes and their genetic mutations can be considered as important candidate genes and mutations for the immunity of pregnant sows.

AB Background: Alcohol intake and tobacco smoking have significant negative health consequences and both are influenced by genetic predispositions. Some studies suggest that the FTO gene is associated with alcohol consumption. We investigated whether a tagging variant (rs17817449) within the FTO gene is associated with alcohol intake, problem drinking and smoking behaviour.
   Methods: We analysed data from 26,792 Caucasian adults (47.2% of males; mean age 58.9 (+/- 7.3) years), examined through the prospective cohort HAPIEE study. The primary outcomes were daily alcohol consumption, binge drinking, problem drinking (CAGE score 2+) and smoking status in relation to tagging variants within the F7'0 and ADH1B genes.
   Results: We found no significant association of the FTO polymorphism with smoking status in either sex. The associations of the FTO polymorphism with drinking pattern were inconsistent and differed by gender. In men, GG homozygote carriers had lower odds of problem drinking (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75-0.96, p = 0.03). In women, the combination of the FTO/ADH1B GG/+A genotypes doubled the risk of binge drinking (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.19-3.71, p < 0.05), and the risk was further increased among smoking women (OR 4.10, 95% CI 1.64-10.24, p = 0.008).
   Conclusions: In this large population study, the FTO gene appeared associated with binge and problem drinking, and the associations were modified by sex, smoking status and the ADH1B polymorphism.

AB Muscle LIM protein (MLP/CSRP3/CRP3) is a microtubule-associated protein preferentially expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle and has a central role during muscle development and for architectural maintenance of muscle cells. LIM-domain proteins act as both modulators and downstream targets of TGF-beta signaling, which is well documented to negatively regulate differentiation of myogenic precursor cells or myoblasts. Herein, we determined whether CSRP3 regulates chicken satellite cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro, and examined its mechanism of action by focusing on the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Interference of CSRP3 mRNA expression had no effect on the proliferation of satellite cells, but significantly inhibited satellite cell differentiation into myotubes at 24, 48, and 72 h after initiation of differentiation. However, CSRP3 overexpression did not affect the proliferation or differentiation of satellite cells. Moreover, knockdown of CSRP3 caused up regulation of TGF-beta and Smad3 mRNA and protein levels. The phosphorylation of Smad3 in CSRP3-knockdown cells was greater than that in wild-type cells at 24, 48, and 72 h after initiation of differentiation. Collectively, knockdown of CSRP3 suppressed chicken satellite cell differentiation by regulating Smad3 phosphorylation in the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Our results indicate that CSRP3 might play an important role in promoting satellite cell differentiation in chicken.

AB Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been wildly verified to modulate multiple tumorigenesis, especially nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In present study, we aims to investigate the role and mechanism of LINC00520 in the NPC carcinogenesis. Results indicated that LINC00520 was significantly increasing in NPC tissues and cells in comparison to their corresponding controls. Moreover, the aberrant overexpression of LINC00520 indicated the poor prognosis of NPC patients. Silence of LINC00520 was able to repress NPC cell growth in vitro while overexpression of LINC00520 inversed this process. Moreover, in vivo tumor xenografts were establishing using CNE-1/SUNE-1 cells to investigate the function of LINC00520 in NPC tumorigenesis. Rescue assay was conducting to further confirm that LINC00520 contributed to NPC progression by regulating miR-26b-3p/ubiquitin-specific protease 39 (USP39) signal pathway. Taken together, our study discovered the oncogenic role of LINC00520 in clinical specimens and cellular experiments, showing the potential LINC00520/miR-26b-3p/USP39 pathway. This results and findings provide a novel insight for NPC tumorigenesis.

AB Genetic variants in monoamine neurotransmitter genes have been recurrently associated with panic disorder, addiction and mood disorders. Recent evidence also indicates that norepinephrine neurotransmission can influence a series of psychophysical and psychobiological parameters related to athletic performance, and the presence of variants in the SLC6A2 (solute carrier family 6 member 2) gene, which encodes the norepinephrine transporter, can be detrimental to an adequate noradrenergic signaling. Accordingly, the objective of the present study was to explore the SLC6A2 Thr99Ile variant (rs1805065) in a cohort composed of highly-trained individuals and non-trained individuals. A total of 1556 Brazilians: 926 non-athletes and 630 athletes (322 endurance athletes and 308 power athletes) were compared in this case-control association study. The Thr99Ile variant showed only two genotypes (C/C or C/T), and a low minor allele frequency of approximate to 1%. However, none of the power athletes had the mutant T-allele (i.e., the C/T genotype), which may be related to decreased nor epinephrine transporter activity. The genotype distribution and allele frequency observed in power athletes were significantly different when compared to non-athletes or endurance athletes. Therefore, the presence of the T-allele may decrease the chance of belonging to the group of athletes involved in explosive physical tasks. These results still need to be replicated in independent cohorts. However, it appears reasonable to assume that there is an association between the SLC6A2 gene variant and power athletic status.

AB We investigated the activity of chondrogenic markers and variation of methylation patterns in equine cartilaginous cells cultivated in monolayer. The transcriptional and epigenetic effect of the long-term culture of chondrocytes has been evaluated using several passages of chondrocyte cell-lines derived from equine articular cartilage. Using 3 genes as endogenous control we tested the expression of 7 genes important for different stages of chondrocyte differentiation and maturation. CpG islands in RUNX3 locus were inspected for the evaluation of differential methylation state of passaged cell-lines. The general decline of transcript abundance of marker loci was detected in passage 11 which is the sign of dedifferentiation of cultivated chondrocytes in prolonged monolayer culture. Passages 13 and 14 were characterized by the upregulation of a number of genes, possibly due to the heterogeneity of developed cell lines at this stage of the culture. Instead, gradual increase of methylation percent at particular CpG sites of RUNX3 locus was associated with the growing number of passage. This finding led us to the conclusion that epigenetic alterations better describe the stage of cultivated chondrocytes.

AB The genic male sterility (MS) plays a major role in melon hybrids production, it could reduce the cost of pollination and increase the yield and quality. However, the molecular mechanism underlying genetic male sterility is yet poorly understood. The morphological differences of flower buds of melon were observed showed that the flower buds were tetrad when they were 1 mm stage and monocyte microspore when they were 2 mm stage. Electron microscopy showed that there was significant difference between MS lines and MF (male fertility) lines. In order to detect the global expression of the genes during the melon anther development and association with MS, 12 DEGs (differentially expressed genes) libraries were constructed from the anther of MS and MF in the bud stage with 1 and 2 mm diameter, respectively. A total of 765 DEGs expressed in anther during different developmental stage (MS 1 mm vs. MS 2 mm), 148 and 309 DEGs were found to be related to MS as compared to MF (MS 1 mm vs. MF 1 mm, and MS 2 mm vs. MF 2 mm) at a false discovery rate FDR < 0.01. Among these, 10 DEGs were expressed in all the three comparisons, including transcription factor bHLH genes. Among the DEGs in RNA-seq analysis, 28 were validated by qRT-PCR. Of these, a number of genes were involved in ABC trans factor B family, cytochrome-related genes, hormone-related genes (auxin transporter, gibberellin-regulated protein), MADS-box protein genes, F-box protein genes, peroxidase-related, and Zinc finger protein genes. These genes are involved in many biological pathways, including starch and sucrose metabolism, signal transduction mechanisms and transcription factors, etc. Compared to the same developmental stage of MS and MF, the different developmental stages of MS indicated diverse gene regulation pathways involved in the anther development in MS. These results would provide novel insight into the global network to male sterility in melon.

AB Liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) contribute to tumorigenesis, progression, drug resistance and recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the underlying mechanism for the propagation of liver CSCs remains unclear. Herein, we observed miR-613 expression was downregulated in both chemoresistant and recurrent HCC patients. A remarkable decrease in miR-613 was detected in CD24 or OV6-positive liver CSCs and CSC-enriched hepatoma spheres. Down-regulation of miR-613 facilitated liver CSCs expansion by promoting the dedifferentiation of hepatoma cells and enhancing the self-renewal of liver CSCs. Mechanistically, bioinformatic and luciferase reporter analysis identified SOX9 as a direct target of miR-613. Overexpression of miR-613 inhibited the expression of SOX9 in HCC cells. Special SOX9 siRNA abolished the discrepancy in liver CSCs proportion and the self-renewal capacity between miR-613 overexpression hepatoma cells and control cells, which further confirmed that SOX9 was required in miR-613-inhibited liver CSCs expansion. Furthermore, hepatoma cells with miR-613 overexpression performed more sensitivity to cisplatin or sorafenib treatment. Conclusion: miR-613 could inhibit HCC cell dedifferentiation and liver CSCs expansion by targeting SOX9 signaling and may prove to be a novel therapeutic target for HCC patients.

AB Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common form of inherited retinal degenerative diseases. X-linked RP accounts for nearly 15% of all RP cases. In this study, we identified a novel RP2 missense mutation Q158P in a Chinese XLRP family. The RP2 Q158P mutation located in the RP2 TBCC domain and obviously destabilized RP2 protein in ARPE-19 cells. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 could restore the RP2 Q158P protein levels. Meanwhile, lower doses of bortezomib and carfilzomib, another two proteasome inhibitors that have been approved in multiple myeloma clinical therapy, also could rescue the RP2 Q158P protein levels. The ubiquitination of RP2 Q158P protein obviously increased when compared with wild type RP2 protein. Our findings broadened the spectrum of RP2 mutations and may contribute a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of XLRP.

AB The formation of bovine adipose tissue involves complex developmental and physiological processes that play a vital role in determining the quality of beef; however, the regulatory mechanisms are largely unknown. Angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8) has been reported to be involved in the development of adipose tissue; however, the mechanism of adipogenesis which is regulated by ANGPTL8 has not been revealed in cattle. In this study, RT-qPCR and Oil Red 0 staining were performed to detect the expression of ANGPTL8 and adipocyte differentiation in bovine. We found that ANGPTL8 had a high expression level in adipose tissue and that the expression pattern was consistent with those of PPAR gamma, C/EBP alpha and LPL which are key regulators and transcription factors involved in preadipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis. The overexpression of ANGPTL8 by the adenovirus vector promoted lipid droplet formation in adipocytes. Thus, we speculated that ANGPTL8 could significantly enhance lipid deposition. Moreover, the expression of LPL and SREBP1, key genes inhibiting adipogenesis, was significantly decreased by ANGPTL8 overexpression. These results suggested that ANGPTL8 promotes adipocyte differentiation. In conclusion, we consider that ANGPTL8 regulates adipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis in bovine.

AB Background: Across the globe, gastric cancer is a significant public health problem. This meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the association of microRNA-27a (miRNA-27a) rs895819 with gastric cancer risk.
   Methods: The search of databases updated on October 10, 2018 included Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of science. Odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (Cls) were calculated to assess the risk of tumor.
   Results: Overall meta-analysis suggested the miRNA-27a rs895819 was not related to the gastric carcinogenesis among all model including allele contrast (G vs A, pooled OR: 1.096, 95% CI: 0.962-1.249, P = 0.196), codominant model (GG vs AA, pooled OR: 1.124, 95% CI: 0.794-1.592, P = 0.590; AG vs AA, pooled OR: 1.101, 95% CI: 0.966-1.217, P = 0.060), dominant model (AG + GG vs AA, pooled OR: 1.123, 95% CI: 0.964-1.307, P = 0.136) and recessive model (GG vs AG + AA, pooled OR: 0.927, 95% CI: 0.673-1.278, P = 0.644). Interestingly, among different ethnicity group, significant relation between rs895819 and gastric cancer was observed in co-dominant model among Chinese population (AG vs AA, pooled OR: 1.158, 95% CI: 1.038-1.291, P = 0.008) but not some regions of European population (AG vs AA, pooled OR: 0.852, 95% CI: 0.632-1.148, P = 0.179).
   Conclusions: Our results find that rs895819 contributed to occurrence of gastric cancer in co-dominant model in Chinese population.

AB Ecdysone is involved in regulation of embryonic diapause in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. However, its mechanism still remains unclear. To explore the role of ecdysteroidogenic pathway (EP) genes in diapause process of bivoltine B. mori, the eggs of "Qiufeng", a bivoltine strain, were used as the study materials and arranged into diapause eggs producers (DEPs) and non-diapause eggs producers (NDEPs), respectively. The differential expression of EP genes between two groups was analysed during the early pupal stage. The expression of Shadow was significantly increased in the NDEPs in day-3 pupae and reached the peak simultaneously, indicating that Shadow was in coincidence with diapause process. To validate this hypothesis, a repression of Shadow by RNA interference was performed in day-2 pupae of NDEPs. The expression of Shadow was downregulated by RNAi, and beta Ftz-F1, a downstream gene of EP, was also decreased. Furthermore, the genes encoding the kynurenine-synthetase were upregulated in the ovary, and Brown, AdenoK which link Shadow to the kynurenine-synthase gene were also upregulated in the fat body. The progeny eggs appeared a light purple colour at 48 h after oviposition, revealing a certain tendency to diapause. We speculate that inhibition of Shadow upregulates 3-hydroxy-kynurenine synthesis by increasing the expression of Brown and AdenoK. In addition, Shadow was cloned, and expressed in E. toll for further functional study of Shadow protein. Our study provided insight into the role of EP genes in the process of diapause of B. mori.

AB Light is fundamental for plants in growth and development, with regulating by integration of photoreceptors, hormones, and transcription factors. In this study, the cucumber seedlings were supplemented with different ratios of red and blue light (1R1B, 2R1B, 1R2B and weak daylight as control), with triggering change of phenotype, and gene expression profiles of CsPHYs and CsCRYs, CsGAs/BRs, and CsPIFs in hypocotyls. The cucumber seedling growth was significantly improved by supplemental light quality as compared with CK, and the seedlings in 2R1B were the stoutest, with obviously shortening hypocotyls, and higher dry weight and seedlings index at two-leaf stage. The gene expression of photoreceptor and hormone, including CsPHYA, CsPHYB, CsCRY1, CsGA20ox1, CsGA20ox2, CsGA3ox1, was significantly up-regulated in hypocotyl under different supplemental light conditions. The cucumber seedlings silenced by pTRV2-PIF4 had an obvious shortened hypocotyl. The expression level of CsCRY1, CsGA20oxl and CsGA3oxl was markedly down-regulation, whereas CsPHYA and CsPHYB expression increased observably and CsGA20ox2 expression was not dramatically difference in pTRV2-PIF4-infected seedlings. Thus, cucumber seedlings hypocotyl elongation was regulated by different supplemental light through crosstalk of photoreceptor, GAs, PIFs, and increasing ratio of red light could promote suppression of hypocotyl elongation.

AB Sucrose plays pivotal role in energy metabolism and regulating gene expression of several physiological processes in higher plants. Here, fourteen sucrose synthase (SUS) genes have been identified in the allotetraploid genome of Indian mustard, Brassica juncea. The identified SUS genes in B. juncea (BjSUS) were derived from the two-progenitor species, B. rapa and B. nigra. Intron-exon analysis indicated loss or gain of 1-3 introns in diversification of SUS gene family. Phylogenetic analysis revealed discrete evolutionary paths for the BjSUS genes, originating from three ancestor groups, SUS I, SUS II and SUS III. Gene expression study revealed significant variability in expression of the BjSUS paralogs across the different tissues. BjSUS genes showed transcriptional activation in response to defense hormones and a late response to wounding. Tissue and temporal specificity of expression revealed importance of specific SUS paralogs at different developmental stages and under different stress conditions. The study highlighted differential involvement of SUS paralogs in sucrose metabolism across the tissues and stress-responses, in a major oilseed crop B. juncea.

AB Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) can enhance regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI), but survival of transplanted cells remains poor. Understanding how NSPCs respond to the chemical mediators of secondary injury thus is essential for treating SCI. Thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4) has physiological functions that are highly relevant to SCI. We exposed NSPCs to oxidative stress and found reduced expression of T beta 4 in H2O2-injured NSPCs. Using an MTT assay, we found that T beta 4 dose dependently increased viability of the injured NSPCs. T beta 4 also reversed the decreases of intracellular Ca2+ concentration and increases of lactate dehydrogenase in NSPCs induced by H2O2 treatment. H2O2 exposure increased NSPC apoptosis, which T beta 4 decreased. In H2O2-induced NSPCs, ROS production and pro-inflammatory cytokines increased, and again, T beta 4 reversed these effects. We investigated the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) signaling pathway as an underlying mechanism in T beta 4's protective effect on H2O2-exposed NSPCs. Our results showed that T beta 4 reduced expression of TLR4 and MyD88. Moreover, H2O2-exposed NSPCs that were treated with the TLR4/MyD88 pathway inhibitor showed a reversal of all the effects caused by H2O2, similar to T beta 4's effects. In conclusion, our study determined that T beta 4 attenuated H2O2-induced oxidative stress injury in NSPCs via the TLR4/MyD88 pathway.

Further the samples were subjected to analyze glutathione-S-transferase (GST) i.e. GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphism, variance of G6PD among G6PD deficient samples by PCR-RFLP. Oxidative stress and DNA damage by comet assay was also analyzed.
   Results: Present finding indicates positive correlation between SCA and G6PD deficiency in Durg and Rajnandgaon district [Durg: (r = 0.92; HbAS-G6PDd and r = 0.56; HbSS-G6PDd) Rajnandgaon: (r = 0.63; HbAS-G6PDd and r = 0.86; HbSS-G6PDd)]. Significant changes (P < 0.05) in antioxidant enzymatic parameters were observed in HbSS and G6PD with sickle positive individual. Assessment of DNA damage by Comet assay considering Head DNA percent, Tail DNA percent, Tail length and Tail moment also showed significant changes (P < 0.05) within all concerned parameters in HbSS and G6PD with sickle positive individual. Analysis of GST gene polymorphism showed that frequency of individuals carrying the GSTM1 null genotype was higher in HbAS (60%) and the frequency of individual carrying the GSTT1 null genotype was found higher in HbSS (66.6%). G6PD variants analysis also confirmed the presence of highest percentage of mutation among G6PD deficient population as compared to control and a positive correlation was observed between G6PD deficiency and mutant variants of G6PD gene [Rajnandgaon: (r = 0.67; G6PDd-Mahidol mutated and r = 0.90; G6PDd-Union mutated) Durg: (r = 0.91; G6PDd-Mahidol mutated and r = 0.01; G6PDd-Union mutated)].
   Conclusion: Thus present finding indicates positive correlation between SCA and G6PD deficiency in Chhattisgarh, India.

AB Collagen alpha-1(III) chain, also known as the alpha 1 chain of type III collagen, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the COL3A1 gene. Three alpha 1 chains are required to form the type III collagen molecule which has a long triple-helical domain. Type III collagen, an extracellular matrix protein, is synthesized by cells as a preprocollagen. It is found as a major structural component in hollow organs such as large blood vessels, uterus and bowel. Other functions of type III collagen include interaction with platelets in the blood clotting cascade and it is also an important signaling molecule in wound healing. Mutations in the COL3A1 gene cause the vascular type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS; OMIM 130050). It is the most serious form of EDS, since patients often die suddenly due to a rupture of large arteries. Inactivation of the murine Col3a1 gene leads to a shorter life span in homozygous mutant mice. The mice die prematurely from a rupture of major arteries mimicking the human vEDS phenotype. The biochemical and cellular effects of COL3A1 mutations have been studied extensively. Most of the glycine mutations lead to the synthesis of type III collagen with reduced thermal stability, which is more susceptible for proteinases. Intracellular accumulation of this normally secreted protein is also found. Ultrastructural analyses have demonstrated dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum and changes in the diameter of collagen fibers. Other clinical conditions associated with type III collagen are several types of fibroses in which increased amounts of type III collagen accumulate in the target organs.

AB Long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) is recently linked to various types of cancers, CCAT and PVT1 are two LncRNAs linked to t(8;21) associated Acute Myeloid Leukemia, the interplay between CCAT, PVT1 and the MYC proto-oncogene implicated in t(8;21) could present an opportunity for using LncRNA as prognostic biomarker or a target for therapy, We investigated the expression levels of LncRNAs in 70 patients; 30 with t(8;21) positive AML and 40 with t(8;21) negative AML, We found that CCAT1 and PVT1 are expressed in higher levels in t(8;21) positive -AML by 5.3 folds compared to t(8;21) negative group; the expression values were significantly associated with high-risk clinical criteria; moreover, they are associated with lower overall survival (OS) rate and leukemia-free survival (LFS), however we didn't find a statistically significant cut-off value of LncRNAs using the Cox regression analysis for Lnc_PVT1 except with LFS, we conclude that high expression levels of CCAT1 and PVT1 are associated with poor prognosis while being poor prognostic biomarkers in t(8;21) associated AML.

AB Genetic engineering approaches offer an alternative method to the citrus canker resistance breeding. The ethylene response factor (ERF) family is a member of families of transcription factors that are particular to plants and contribute significantly to biotic stress response and to plant growth. CsAP2-09 belongs to the citrus AP2/ERF transcription factor family. Initially, we proved the induction of CsAP2-09 in wild-types by Xcc and some hormones involved in pathogen response. We successfully cloned the CsAP2-09 and proved that CsAP2-09 protein is targeted to the nucleus. The CsAP2-09 was functionally characterized with over-expression and RNAi silencing strategy. In the overexpression lines, the diseased lesions and disease index were significantly decreased while in RNAi lines of CsAP2-09 the diseased lesions and disease index were significantly enhanced. Thus, the over-expression conferred Xcc resistance to transgenic citrus while silencing of CsAP2-09 in sweet orange leads to Xcc susceptibility. When the transcriptomes of WT and overexpression transcriptomes were compared, they revealed that some genes involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, pathogen responses, transcript regulation etc. were modified. Our results provide a possibility for improving citrus canker disease resistance by over-expression of CsAP2s. Furthermore, various functions of CsAP2-09 provide significant information about the role of AP2/ERFs in plant disease resistance and stress tolerance.

AB Transcription factor (TF) genes play essential roles in abiotic stress responses as master switches in complex regulatory networks. In the present study, the transcript abundance of 4287 TF genes in Populus simonii x P.nigra were profiled under NaCl, KCI, CdCl2 and PEG stresses, respectively. A total of 118 up-regulated and 226 down-regulated TFs were identified to be shared in the four stress conditions. Among the top seven TF families (ERF, NAC, WRKY, MYB, bHLH, C2H2, bZIP), there were 76 up-regulated TFs found common in the four stresses, and 67% of them were likely to be involved in stress responses. We identified three TFs, which can enhance stress tolerance of transgenic plants, were members of the most significantly up-regulated genes in the respective TF family. Among them, a highly salt-inducible ERF gene, ERF76, was proved to activate the expression of other TFs in the transgenic poplar lines overexpressing ERF76. Transcriptome analysis indicated there was a synergistic effect of TFs on improving salinity tolerance of the transgenic plants. Of significant interest in the study is the discovery of the role and interactions of various TF genes under multiple stress conditions.

AB Background: Drug-induced kidney injury (DIKI) can be manifested with progressive chronic kidney diseases or end-stage renal diseases. Understanding the molecular disarrangements caused by DIM is an attractive point of interest. A class of non-coding RNA called microRNAs (miRNAs) is known to play a major role in regulation of gene expression and signaling pathways making miRNAs excellent targets for new therapeutic agents.
   Aim of the study: We aimed to investigate the role of miRNA 21 and 181a in gentamicin (GNT) induced nephrotoxicity rat model and the protective effect of Dapagliflozin (DAPA) in modulating their expression through studying its effect on renal function as well as renal histopathological changes.
   Materials and methods: Wistar rats were used and divided into: naive, DAPA, GNT and DAPA + GNT groups. In all studied groups, kidney function, oxidative stress, apoptosis markers and miRNAs' expression in serum and renal biopsies were investigated in addition to the histopathological studies to identify its early renoprotective effect.
   Results: DAPA was found to improve kidney function, oxidative stress markers, decrease apoptosis of renal tubular cells and increase miR-21 but decrease the expression of miR-181a with restoration of the renal architecture after 14 days of treatment in GNT induced nephrotoxicity rat model.
   Conclusions: DAPA produced significant decrease in renal expression of miR-181a on the other hand it increased the expression of renal miR-21, this may introduce a novel early protective effect of DAPA against GNT-induced nephrotoxicity.

AB Clusterbean (C. tetragonoloba) is an important, leguminous vegetable and industrial crop with vast genetic diversity but meager genetic, cytological and genomic information. In the present study, an optimized procedure of flow cytometry was used to estimate the genome size of three clusterbean species, represented by C. tetragonoloba (cv. RGC-936) and two wild relatives (C. serreta and C. senegalensis). For accurate estimation of genomic content, singlet G(0)/G(1) populations of multiple tissues such as leaves, hypocotyl, and matured seeds were determined and used along with three different plant species viz. Pisum sativum (as primary), Oryza saliva, and Glycine max (secondary), as external and internal reference standards. Seed tissue of the test sample and G. max provided the best estimate of nuclear DNA content in comparison to other sample tissues and reference standards. The genome size of C. tetragonoloba was detemined at 580.9 +/- 0.02 Mbp (1C), while that of C. serreta and C. senegalensis was estimated at 979.6 +/- 0.02 Mbp (1C) and 943.4 +/- 0.03 Mbp (1C), respectively. Thus, the wild relatives harbor, nearly double the genome content of the cultivated cluster bean. Findings of this study will enrich genomic database of the legume family and can serve as the starting point for clusterbean evolutionary and genomics studies.

AB Background Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, irreversible neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of memory and cognitive skills. More than 90% of cases are sporadic and have later age of onset. Many studies have shown a genetic predisposition for late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). The most studied genetic predisposition factor is apolipoprotein E gene besides other susceptibility genes involved in vascular pathologies, homocysteine metabolism, and neuronal growth and differentiation such as methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), APOB and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).
   Methods: In this study Factor V Leiden (G1691A) and H1299R, prothrombin G20210A, Factor XIII V34L, B-fibrinogen -455G > A, PAI-1 5G/4G, HPA1 b/a, MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C, APOE, ACE I/D, BDNF C270T and G196A polymorphisms were evaluated in 100 LOAD patients and 100 age matched healthy controls.
   Results: APOE4 allele, MTHFR CCA1298C and BDNF TTC270T genotypes were significantly higher in LOAD patients compared to the control group (p < 0.001, p = 0.04, p = 0.03, respectively). There were no significant associations between other genotypes and allele frequencies. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and age at onset of the patients were also evaluated for each and combined genotypes. Age at onset was significantly lowered by about approximately 4 and 5 years in patients carrying BDNF TTC270T and MTHFR TTC677T genotypes, respectively.
   Conclusion: APOE, MTHFR A1298C and BDNF C270T polymorphisms may be associated with LOAD and BDNF and MTHFR alleles may play a role in the age at onset of the LOAD.

AB The expression of homeobox gene DLX4 has been verified in some tumors, but not in endometrial cancer. We found that expression of DLX7, a splicing isoform of DLX4, did not show any significant difference in expression between endometrial cancer and endometrium. However, BPI, another splicing isoform of DLX4, was highly expressed in endometrial cancer, and its expression was positively correlated with patient prognosis, cancer pathological grade, tumor invasion and metastasis. Lentiviral-mediated expression of Bill in HEC-1-B cells accelerated the cell cycle progression from G0/G1 into S phase, and promoted cell proliferation and migration both in vitro and in vivo. Real-time PCR and western blotting showed that the expression levels of p15, p21 and E-cadherin significantly decreased, and levels of cyclinD1 and MMP-2 increased in endometrial cancer cells. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that high expression of BPI is associated with poor prognosis in patients with endometrial cancer and promotes cell proliferation and migration.

AB LncRNA TUC338 has recently been characterized as an oncogene in several types of cancer. Our study aimed to characterize the functionality of TUC338 in prostate carcinoma. It was observed that TUC338 was upregulated in tumor tissues comparing to adjacent healthy tissues of prostate carcinoma patients. Plasma levels of TUC338 were also higher in prostate carcinoma patients than in healthy controls. A 5-year follow-up study showed that high plasma level of TUC338 was correlated with poor survival. miR-466 was downregulated in tumor tissues compared with adjacent healthy tissues of prostate carcinoma patients. TUC338 and miR-466 were inversely correlated in tumor tissues. miR-466 overexpression failed to affect TUC338 expression, while TUC338 overexpression led to downregulated miR-466 expression. TUC338 overexpression failed to significantly affect cancer cell proliferation, but promoted cancer cell migration and invasion. MiR-466 overexpression resulted in reduced rates of cancer cell migration and invasion, and also attenuated the effect of TUC338 overexpression. Therefore, TUC338 may serve as an oncogenic lncRNA in prostate carcinoma by downregulating miR-466.

AB Recent developments in the field of the messenger RNA and its advantages versus DNA have led to a renewed interest in mRNA-based technologies. Despite its advantages, mRNA therapy has a number of drawbacks including low amount of mRNA production, short-term existence of mRNA and mRNA-mediated protein within the cell, severe mRNA cytotoxicity, and immune response activation following mRNA transfection. Here, we applied untranslated regions of human beta-globin to increase the stability and translation efficiency of a destabilized GFP mRNA. In order to suppress the innate immune response, which is the main barrier of mRNA therapy, we used the vaccinia virus derived capping enzyme and substituted standard nucleotides with modified nucleotides. At the end, the Kozak sequence of human beta-globin was replaced with the strongest sequence for the further improvement of mRNA translation.
   Overall, these modifications with native Kozak (K1) sequence of human beta-globin enhanced the stability of destabilized GFP mRNA up to 48 h and no increase in the level of interferon-alpha and -beta was found. The GFP expression of mRNA with modified Kozak (K2) sequence initiated earlier than mRNA and plasmid DNA with K1 sequence. In contrast to mRNA with K1 sequence, the cells containing mRNA with K2 sequence remained positive for GFP expression up to 72 h post-transfection. Interestingly, transfection efficiency and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of mRNA with K2 sequence were higher than mRNA and plasmid DNA with K1 sequence. Taken together, these results provide valuable information for the optimization of mRNA stability and translation. Therefore, the methods used in the current study can successfully be applied for reprogramming, gene editing, trans-differentiation, tumour therapy, and gene therapy.

AB Phenylketonuria (PKU), caused by phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene variants, is a common autosomal inherited metabolic disease. So far, 1111 PAH variants have been revealed. The residual activity of the PAH variants is the key determinant of the metabolic phenotype and BH4 responsiveness in PKU patients.
   In this study, the spectrum of PAH variants in 1083 Chinese PKU patients was analyzed. Then 20 variants (p.L52F, p.R86P, p.L128P, p.L142P, p.D163N, p.C203G, p.E214G, p.F260L, p.M276T, p.L311R, p.P314A, p.L364F, p.Q375H, p.F382I, p.A395S, p.V412D, p.E108(star), p.C203(star), p.C284(star) and p.E353(star)) were expressed in COS-7 cells. The residual activities and protein expression levels were detected by isotope-dilution liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) and Western blotting, respectively. We compared the results of the phenotypic prediction based on APV and PAH activity respectively, and further explored the relationship between residual activity and phenotype in PKU patients.
   We reported 9 newly discovered PAH variants for the first time, thereby expanding the spectrum of PAH variants. Among the 20 variants in our assay, 8 variants showed mild impaired residual activities (48-92%) and approximately normal protein expression levels compared to the wild-type PAH. In contrast, 9 variants showed severely impaired residual activities (0-34%) and reduced protein expression. However, three variants (p.L52F, p.F260L and p.P314A) showed impaired residual activities (5%, 32% and 29%), although the proteins were well expressed. We assigned APV scores for 14 variants, in which the results of the phenotypic prediction were consistent for 12/14 (86%) variants based on APV and residual activity respectively, and the residual activity correctly predicted 17/22 (77%) of the patients. Our study helped to further understand the genotype-phenotype correlation in PKU patients.

AB The sarcoplasmic protein from pale, soft and exudative - like chicken breast meat was modified using an isoelectric solubilization/precipitation process. After the modification, the sarcoplasmic protein obtained a larger particle distribution than the nontreated sample, indicating a severe aggregation. The isoelectric solubilization/precipitation-treated sarcoplasmic protein aggregates exhibited a flocculated and amorphous shape stabilized by the hydrophobic interactions. The hydrophobic interactions of alkali-treated sarcoplasmic proteins were relatively constant during heating, while they dramatically increased in nontreated sample. The alkali-treated sarcoplasmic protein could promote myofibrillar protein gelation properties, as proved by the higher breaking force and lower cooking loss. According to our results, it is hypothesized that the alkali-treated sarcoplasmic protein likely does not interfere in the gelation behavior of myofibrillar protein but does fill in the pores of the three-dimensional network, thereby strengthening its gelation elasticity. Overall, the alkali-treated sarcoplasmic protein exhibits the potential to improve the myofibrillar protein gelation properties.

AB In this study, the inhibiting effects of low-molecular weight polyols on the deterioration of gluten network and noodle texture were systematically investigated, based on dough rheological properties, and the macroscopic, structural and water status changes of gluten protein during storage of fresh noodles. Both glycerol and propylene glycol significantly restrained the decrease of GMP gel weight, LA-SRC value, hardness and springiness, and the increase of cooking loss. SEM showed that polyols retarded the collapse of gluten network, with still continuous gluten fibrils. The inner structure of polyol noodles was much less damaged after 2 days, with more uniform moisture distribution in MRI images. Potential dynamic depolymerization and repolymerization interactions were detected for protein components during processing and cooking, which might contribute to the textural changes. Low-molecular weight polyols inhibited the collapse of gluten network and deterioration of noodle texture although they showed no inhibiting effect on microbial growth.

Here, solution conformation of differently treated curdlan and each hydrolysis rate by a variety of beta-1,3-glucanases were systematically examined. Results showed that different enzymes exhibited preferences over the trajectories of pH change that curdlan solution went through, and all enzymes hydrolyzed heat treated curdlan solution at their maximum rates where most of the higher ordered helices were diminished. Combined with molecular docking studies, a multi-step hydrolysis process was proposed. Recognition of triple-helical curdlan by their ancillary region of beta-1,3-glucanase occurred before its unwinding into single-and double-helical forms, and the later ones fitted better to the catalytic cavity of the enzyme where the polysaccharides chain eventually got hydrolyzed into oligo-beta-glucans.

AB The absorption of oil during frying has important implications for food quality, cost, and nutrition. Maize starches with low (WMS), intermediate (NMS), and high amylose (HAMS) contents were therefore heated in oil to mimic the frying process, and the impact of amylose content on the hierarchical structures and oil absorption of the fried starches was evaluated. Amylose affected the oil absorption by interfering with the structural evolution of the starch or by directly interacting with the lipids during frying. At low moisture level (20%), the granular state was preserved after frying and so the size and porosity of the granules played a dominant role in the oil absorption process, explaining why the highest oil absorption occurred in WMS. At 40% moisture content, NMS absorbed the most oil because of its granular morphology and lower crystallinity. At 60% moisture content, HAMS absorbed more oil than NMS, because more amylose molecules in HAMS provided more hydrophobic helical cavities available for lipids.

AB The current methods used to routinely assess freshness in the fishing industry reflect more a state of spoilage than a state of freshness. Mitochondria, the seat of cellular respiration, undergo profound changes in post mortem tissues. The objective of this study was to demonstrate that mitochondrial activity constitutes a putative early fish freshness marker. The structure of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) muscle tissue was evaluated over time by transmission electron microscopy. Respiration was assessed in mitochondria isolated from sea bream fillets using oxygraphy. Membrane potential (Delta Psi(m)) was determined by fluorescence (Rhodamine 123). Mitochondrial activity of fillets stored at + 4 degrees C was studied for 6 days. Changes in mitochondrial cristae structure appeared from Day 3 highlighting the presence of dense granules Delta Psi(m) and mitochondrial activity were significantly disrupted in sea bream fillets after 96 h of storage at + 4 degrees C. Mitochondrial activity constituted a reliable and early indicator of fish freshness.

AB Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) combined with partial least squares (PLS) was developed for the rapid determination of squalene and sterols (brassicasterol, campesterol, stigmasterol and beta-sitosterol) in 119 vegetable oils from 7 different species. The H-1 NMR spectra of these oil samples were correlated to the reference value determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method by PLS regression, using outlier removal, selection of input X-variables and data pretreatments. Auto-scaling (UV) was chosen as the best preprocessing for the PLS models of stigmasterol, ss-sitosterol, and squalene. Pareto variance (Par) was more suitable for the PLS model of brassicasterol. The model for squalene was further improved by a reduced number of variables with variable importance for the projection (VIP) scores technique. The study demonstrated the potential application of NMR coupled with PLS as a rapid and nondestructive technique for the routine analysis of squalene and sterols in vegetable oils.

AB Using an aggregation-induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) as the fluorescence signal part, a novel molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) based ratiometric fluorescence sensor (AIE-MIPs-1) was developed for detecting Rhodamine 6G (Rh6G) in food samples including dried papaya and beverage. The sensor exhibited strong blue fluorescence itself at 420 nm. Upon the adsorption of Rh6G, the original fluorescence intensity decreased while a new fluorescence emission peak at 562 nm increased gradually, which showed typical ratiometric fluorescence change. Good linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity ratio (I-562/I-420) and the concentration of Rh6G was obtained in the range of 0.0-10.0 mu mol/L. A detection limit of 0.26 mu mol/L Rh6G was achieved. Moreover, AIE-MIPs-1 exhibited good sensitivity towards Rh6G over other colorants. This study provided a new strategy for construction of MIPs-based fluorescence sensors by introducing AIEgens as the fluorescence signal part, which will significantly expand the categories and application ranges of MIPs-based fluorescence sensors.

AB Propolis has demonstrated potential use as food preservative but it presents strong and unpleasant flavor that alters the sensory characteristics foods. A nanoemulsion was proposed to carry the Brazilian propolis extracts for use as natural food preservative. Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities and chemical constituents of the extracts were investigated. The latter were made by sequential extraction using different solvents (hexane, ethyl acetate and ethanol). Antimicrobial activity was evaluated by agar diffusion and microdilution methods and antioxidant activity by DPPH and ABTS assays. Extracts showed antibacterial and antioxidant activity, highlighting the ethanolic which contained artepillin-C, kaempferide, drupanin and p-coumaric acid as main compounds by LC-MS analysis. The nanoemulsion developed by phase inversion method was characterized and stable under thermal-stress and centrifugation conditions. Biological properties evaluated were effectively maintained by the formulation. It was concluded that the nanoemulsion can be used as a food preservative, preventing degradation and masking the propolis off-flavor.

AB Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) modified with polydopamine were covalently immobilized with nisin to inhibit the growth of Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris in apple juice. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of IONPs @ pDA-nisin composites against Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris cells and spores in three kinds of apple juice were 1.25 mg/mL and 2.5 mg/mL, respectively. The concentration of cells and spores decreased from 10(6) to 10 CFU/mL in apple juice after pretreatment with the composites at the concentration of 20 mg/mL for 10 min. Meanwhile, the investigation of the content of polyphenols, organic acids, volatile compounds and sugars indicated that there was no significant influence of the composites on the apple juices. The results of cytotoxicity (HepG2, Caco 2, SH-SY5Y, and BV2 cells) and acute toxicity test demonstrated the biosecurity and nontoxicity of the composites, which suggested that it was promising to apply the proposed composites to apple juice industry for the control of Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris pollution.

AB In this study, the succinic anhydride (SA) modified whey protein isolate (WPI) and whey protein hydrolysates (WPH) were prepared and characterized as novel emulsifiers. After the succinylation, the solubility, emulsibility, and water/oil binding capacity of WPI/WPH were improved. Emulsions with modified and unmodified WPI/WPH were prepared and characterized on rheological property, particle sizes, and droplet distribution using rheometer, zeta-sizer and confocal laser scanning microscopy. A simulated digestion system was utilized to monitor the gastrointestinal fate of emulsions and the bioaccessibility of curcumin loaded in emulsions. The final digestion extents of WPIE-10 and WPHE-10 (emulsions stabilized by modified WPI/WPH with 10% SA addition) were lower than those of WPIE-0 and WPHE-0 (emulsions stabilized by unmodified WPI/WPH). The order of curcumin bioaccessibility was WPIE-10 (79.64%)approximate to WPHE-10 (86.75%) > WPIE-0 (64.23%)approximate to WPHE-0 (60.62%). Our study provided valuable information about novel emulsifiers stabilizing delivery system to improve curcumin bioaccessibility.

AB Effects of two typical comminution methods (shearing and blending) on structural and biochemical properties of silver carp surimi were comparatively investigated. Surimi myofibrils in striated appearance were progressively disrupted within 15 min of blending. The myofibrils were completely disintegrated after shearing for 5 min. Surface hydrophobicity of surimi increased and then gradually decreased (p < 0.05) under shearing, while it continuously increased (p < 0.05) under blending. As shearing time was extended, alpha-helical structure decreased and beta-sheet structure increased simultaneously; surface active sulfhydryl content (SH) increased and then decreased (p < 0.05); and intensity of myosin heavy chain (MHC) was gradually reduced. However, secondary structure, MHC intensity and SH were slightly changed as blending time extended. Ca2+-ATPase activities increased and then declined (p < 0.05) with transition times at 1 min and 5 min under shearing and blending, respectively. Results indicated that shearing disrupted the ultrastructure and changed biochemical properties of surimi more pronouncedly than blending.

AB The influence of pH-induced structural modifications of myofibrillar proteins (MPs) on their interaction mechanisms with pyrazine compounds was investigated. At a lower pH (4.9, 5.5), MPs aggregated to larger particle sizes due to enhanced the protein-protein interactions. The binding with pyrazine compounds was strongly affected by pH and the nature of flavor compounds. MPs exhibited flavor releasing behavior, probably due to protein-protein interactions and surface tension. Fluorescence analysis revealed that the interaction of pyrazine compounds with MPs followed a combination of static and dynamic quenching. The changes in quenching constant (K-sv) might be attributed to a dynamic quenching, probably due to protein aggregation. The percentages of free 2,5-Dimethylpyrazine (2,5-DMP) were similar to K-sv. Thermodynamic parameters indicated that electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions were the major acting forces in the binding of MPs to 2,5-DMP. The binding of 2,5-DMP increased the a-helix content of MPs.

AB Magnetic molecularly imprinted polymers (M-MIPs) with core-shell structure were prepared through the surface molecular imprinting technique by using quercetin as the template molecule. The resultant Fe3O4@MIPs were characterized using X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectrum, transmission electron microscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometer. The Fe3O4@MIPs possessed high adsorption capacity and specific recognition for quercetin. The maximum adsorption capacity of Fe3O4@MIPs towards quercetin was 10.52 mg/g, and could reach binding equilibrium within 30 min. The selectivity and specific recognition ability of Fe3O4@MIPs were evaluated according to their recognition to quercetin and its analogues. The Fe3O4@MIPs were successfully applied as selective sorbents to extract and determine quercetin from apple samples with a relatively high recoveries (89.2-93.6%) and relative standard deviations of <5%. The obtained Fe3O4@MIPs have potential application for quercetin determination in real samples.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate if quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.), a good source of nutrients, fibre, and phytochemicals, can modulate risk disease biomarkers on obese-diabetic (db/db) mice. The db/db mice fed quinoa-supplemented (quinoa) or AIN-93G diet (obese) were compared to lean control fed AIN-93G diet.
   Quinoa intake reduced at significant level plasma total-cholesterol (total-c), LDL-c, and oxidized-LDL to levels similar to lean; lessened protein carbonyls and interleukin (IL)-6. The hepatic steatosis and total-c accumulation in liver were also similar between lean and quinoa and lower than obese. Quinoa fibre and phytochemicals may have contributed to these health benefits. However, quinoa intake increased plasma insulin and did not protect from other pathophysiological manifestations of the db/db research model. More studies are needed with other research models and quinoa doses achievable by human diet to validate the clinical relevance of this study.

AB A practice in wine vinegar production is the addition of grape-must caramel to correct and unify the final colour of different batches. Although current legislation allows it, the effect in vinegars' quality has not been studied yet and it can become a fraud when it is used to simulate the effect of a longer ageing. Therefore, the aim of this work was to assess multidimensional fluorescence as a cost-effective and fast technique for detecting and quantifying grape-must caramel in vinegars. Different amounts of grape-must caramel and multivariate data analysis, as Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC), N-way partial least squares and partial least squares discrimination and regression (NPLS-DA, PLS-DA and NPLS) were studied. Triangle sensory test was also performed. Results demonstrated the ability of this methodology in the detection and quantification of grape-must caramel (low prediction errors, RMSEP approximate to 0.24) and the effects that grape-must caramel has upon a PDO vinegar's final quality.

AB Viscoelasticity experiments were performed to detect the total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) content of chilled beef for freshness evaluation. The growth trend of TVB-N was further analyzed with prolonged storage time. A six-element viscoelastic model was then established by fitting deformation data through universal global optimization. The viscoelastic parameters, including elasticity moduli E-1, E-2, E-3, and viscosity coefficients eta(1), eta(2), eta(3), were applied to build models of TVB-N content prediction using partial least squares regression (PLSR) and support vector machine regression (SVR). Results showed that the SVR model performed better than the PLSR model, with a correlation coefficient in the prediction set of 0.89 and a root mean squared error in the prediction set of 1.47 mg/100 g. These results demonstrated for the first time that the viscoelasticity based on airflow and laser technique combined with chemometrics can be used for the fast, nondestructive detection of TVB-N concentration for meat freshness assessment.

We detected 42 volatile compound variations during smoking, of which 3-methyl-1-butanol, 3,7-dimethyl-1,3,6-octatriene, hydroxy butanone, and 1-octen-3-ol perceived aroma for longan. Aroma characteristics were evaluated smoky effect by agglomerative hierarchical cluster and principal component analysis. Forasmuch phenolic derivatives (smoky flavor) form lignin degradation correlated for the time, and organic compounds via oxidation (or hydrolyzation). We found get the smoky flavor and intermediate moisture of longan in smoked 72 h, which extended sensory and preservation that is beneficial to longan producers.

AB A novel synergistic formulation (TML) based on the combination of thymol (T), methyl cinnamate (M), and linalool (L) has been prepared using the mixture design assay. Nanoencapsulation of developed formulation TML (Ne-TML) was prepared and characterised by SEM, XRD and FTIR. The Ne-TML was assessed for its antifungal and anti-aflatoxin B-1 potential in vitro and in the food systems (Pennisetum glaucum L.), and also examined its effects on organoleptic properties. The Ne-TML cause complete inhibition of growth and AFB(1) production at 0.3 mu l/ml and 0.2 mu l/ml. In-situ results revealed that Ne-TML exhibited maximum protection from fungal (75.40%) and aflatoxin B-1 contamination (100%) at 0.3 mu l/ml during six months of storage. The speculated antifungal mode of action of Ne-TML was related to the decrease in ergosterol content, membrane ions leakage, impairment in carbon-source utilization, mitochondrial functioning, anti-oxidative defence system (SOD, CAT, and GR) and Ver-1 gene of aflatoxin B-1 biosynthesis.

DT Article
DE Rapeseed proteins; Albumins; Globulins; SE-HPLC; Quantification
ID WHEAT-PROTEIN
AB The method described in the article aims at the quantification of both main storage proteins, globulins and albumins, in aqueous extract from rapeseed, as an alternative to the current reference methods, Kjeldahl and SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The new method lies on the analytical separation of extracted compounds by Size-Exclusion High Performance Liquid Chromatography (SE-HPLC) (Biosep-SEC-s2000, 5 mu m). The elution of rapeseed extracts with water/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (45/55/0.1% v/v) during 30 min yields two distinct peaks for the main proteins of rapeseed. Based on the protein extinction coefficients, a calibrationless methodology was developed for their quantification on the basis of the UV signal. The SE-HPLC method was successfully compared to references: Kjeldahl and SDS-PAGE densitometry for the determination of the proportion of each protein. Then, it was successfully applied on two other oleoproteagineous plants, linseed and sunflower.

AB We previously reported that an endo-beta-1,3(4)-D-glucanase, Eng16A, from C. cinerea shows a higher degradation activity toward barley beta-glucan than laminarin. HPAEC-PAD and Q-TOF-MS/MS analyses show that Eng16A-digestion products of barley beta-glucan not only contain some oligosaccharides with (1 -> )-beta-linkage adjacent to the reducing end, which is consistent with beta-1,3(4)-glucanase-digestion products, but also include some oligosaccharides containing (1 -> 4)-beta-linkage adjacent to the reducing end which is consistent with cellulase-digestion products. Thus, Eng16A possesses both cellulase and beta-1,3(4)-glucanase activities. Because Eng16A does not degrade cellulose, we propose that the insertion of a (1 -> 3)-beta(-)linkage among the groups of (1 -> 4)-beta-linkages may make these (1 -> 4)-beta-linkages prone to cleavage by Eng16A. Furthermore, Eng16A also possesses transglycosylation activity which leads to some products containing one or a few consecutive (1 -> 3)-beta-linkages adjacent to the non-reducing end. Therefore, HPAEC-PAD and Q-TOF-MS/MS analyses provide an efficient approach to reveal complicated modes of action of some endo-beta-1,3(4)-D-glucanases on barley beta-glucan.

AB Bakery products with fruit fillings are growing fast. Blueberry-filled pastries are widely consumed in China. This study aimed to investigate the effects of two thermal processing procedures (stir-frying and baking) on flavonoid profile, antioxidant property, and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) formation during preparation of blueberry-filled pastries. Stir-frying contributed the most to the variations in these values in blueberry filling. Anthocyanins (48%-53% reduction in total) were more susceptible to thermal processing than flavonols (11%-16%). Among anthocyanins, delphinidin glycosides (61%-67% reduction) were the most unstable, followed by malvidin (52%-58%), petunidin (40%-45%), and cyanidin (38%-41%). A high level of HMF (300 mg/kg) was formed during stir-frying. Except for anthocyanins, baking did not significantly influence HMF formation, flavonol degradation, and antioxidant property in the fillings. Stir-frying processing conditions rather than baking must be further investigated for nutrient retention and HMF inhibition.

AB The purpose of this work was to investigate the kinds of processes that occur during baking of rye dough, and also to investigate which compounds are most associated with these. The study was conducted with a specially-modified dough containing starch, arabinoxylan preparations and protein obtained from rye wholemeal.
   Despite the same consistency of the dough samples, their pasting and rheological properties depended on the amount of arabinoxylans and their apparent molar mass.
   Partial breakdown of high molar mass arabinoxylan-protein and arabinoxylan-arabinoxylan complexes during baking was confirmed in the modified doughs.
   Heat-induced structural changes of high molar mass complexes influenced competitive hydration among starch, arabinoxylan and protein. Partial breakdown of complexes in samples containing cross-linked arabinoxylan was associated with high degrees of starch swelling at the baking stage. Small changes in complexes during baking from samples containing hydrolysed arabinoxylan were associated with limited swelling, desirable in high-quality bread crumb formation.

AB Freezing-thawing events contribute to the unique aroma profile of icewines. Differences in key odor-active volatile compounds between 'Beibinghong' (Vitis amurensis x V. vinifera) icewines and dry wines were investigated by gas chromatography-olfactometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Acceptable agreement between the olfactometric and quantitative results was obtained. 'Beibinghong' icewine was characterized by high concentrations of volatile phenols, lactones, (E)-beta-damascenone, and phenylacetaldehyde, which were associated with on-vine freezing-thawing events in grape. Low concentrations of higher alcohol acetates and ethyl esters of fatty acids were attributed to hyperosmotic stress during fermentation. The overall aroma of icewine could be mimicked by reconstitution containing 44 identified volatiles. Partial least squares regression analysis demonstrated that the concentrations of these volatile compounds determined the distinct sensory profiles of icewines, which have higher intensities of honey/sweet, smoky, caramel, dried fruit, apricot/peach, and floral aromas, and lower intensities of fresh fruity and herbaceous notes in comparison with dry wines.

AB This study aimed to investigate the influence of drying temperatures (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 degrees C) followed by 12 months-storage under normal-atmosphere (conventional), nitrogen-atmosphere, and vacuum-atmosphere on black rice phenolics. Increase in drying temperature reduced the total content of free-phenolics, free-flavonoids, and anthocyanins. An increase in bound phenolics extractability was observed at 60 and 80 degrees C, suggesting some extent of phenolics polymerization and complexation at these drying temperatures. The free fraction of ferulic, caffeic, p-coumaric, and gallic acids were the most thermally unstable compounds. After storage, no reductions were observed only for free caffeic and protocatechuic acids. For total flavonoids, an increase in the free fraction and reduction of the bound fraction were observed in the grains stored under conventional-and vacuum-atmosphere. A reduction of total phenolics occurred regardless of the storage condition. However, storage under nitrogen-atmosphere is the most recommendable condition for maintenance of phenolics in black rice.

AB A colorimetric aptasensor was developed for the simple and rapid detection of bisphenol A (BPA). The aptasensor was designed to consist of colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and a BPA-specific 24-bp aptamer. The AuNP-aptamer conjugates underwent an electrolyte-induced aggregation in the presence of sub-ppb levels of BPA. The surface plasmon resonance shift of AuNPs facilitated a color change from red to blue upon aggregation, which was visually observed by the naked eye. The corresponding visual limit of detection of BPA was as low as 1 pg/mL (0.004 nM). The aptasensor also achieved a selective detection of BPA over a variety of BPA analogs. The applicability of the aptasensor was verified via a successful detection of BPA in a single grain of rice. This result indicates that the colorimetric aptasensor can be used in a screening procedure for food and environmental monitoring, with reliable performance to sub-ppb levels of BPA detection.

AB Plant origin, physicochemical parameters and composition were analysed to characterize the avocado honey (Persea americana Mill.) from Andalusia (Southern, Spain). Ashes content, total polyphenol, and electrical conductivity corresponded to these of a typical dark honey (>80mm scale Pfund). Regarding mineral elements, K was predominant, followed by P and Mg. Antioxidant and invertase activities presented some desirable values. In the 20 analysed samples, 48 pollen types corresponding to 33 families were identified. Avocado pollen was found in high variability (13-58%). At least a 20% was suggested to guarantee the authentic avocado honey. Perseitol, sugar-alcohol identified only in avocado honey, fundamentally contributes to distinguish this kind of honey. The content varied between 0.31 and 1.56 g/100 g. The correlation between perseitol and avocado pollen was found to be significant. A minimum concentration of 0.30 g/100 g of perseitol is suggested to characterize the proposed monofloral avocado honey.

AB The effect of Lactobacillus plantarum isolates from Stilton cheese on aroma profiles of milk fermentation was examined. Representative Lb. plantarum isolates were cultured alone and in combination with acid-producing and non-acid producing Lactococcus lactis NCIMB 9918 in UHT milk at 30 & 18 degrees C for 48 h & 12 weeks, respectively in presence and absence of salt, simulating cheese production and ripening. During long-term ripening, Lb. plantarum grew faster when co-cultured with non-acid producing Lc. lactis in the presence of salt. One isolate of Lb. plantarum produced the highest concentration of alcohols, organic acids and acetoin. Co-culture of Lb. plantarum with acid-producing Lc. lactis enhanced acid and alcohol production, whereas co-inoculation with non-acid producing Lc. lactis increased acetoin synthesis. Lb. plantarum is an incidental organism in cheese and its presence is unpredictable. Occurrence of different genotypes of Lb. plantarum could contribute to batch to batch variation in the cheese aroma characteristics.

AB The changes of free and bound volatile compounds in Rubus corchorifolius fruit during ripening were determined with a headspace SPME-GC-MS method. The results suggest that the free aldehydes, alcohols, esters and phenols increases, while that of free terpenoids decreases, with the ripening of the fruit. The bound aldehydes, alcohols, terpenoids, esters and phenols gradually decreases during ripening because these bound compounds are hydrolyzed to their free form. The characteristic free aroma compounds of ripened red fruit were found to be hexanal, 2-heptanone, ethyl hexanoate, 4-terpineol, geranial and methyleugenol. The free aroma compounds in red and yellow fruits exhibit similar odor profiles, and both of them are much sweeter, more floral and greener than the green fruit. The overall aroma of the fruits all ripening stages are mainly attributed to the free aroma compounds including beta-damascenone, hexanal, 2-hexenal and linalool. The formation mechanisms of some volatile compounds were proposed.

AB Raman spectroscopy was used to identify chemical changes associated sensory quality of coffee beans, for natural and pulped natural coffee stored in different packaging. The green beans of natural coffee and pulped natural coffee were stored in three types of packaging materials in a commercial warehouse. Sensory analyses were performed, and Raman spectra were collected after 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 storage months. Raman spectra were used to construct multivariate control charts. The charts, which were constructed using principal component analysis, can only be used to identify chemical changes in the green beans from pulped natural coffee stored in different packaging materials. Raman spectroscopy is more sensitive than sensory analysis for detecting chemical changes in stored pulped natural coffee. The measured changes ultimately affect the quality of the beverage because samples stored for six months in paper packaging were determined to no longer meet the quality control requirements.

AB In recent years, 3D-printing has received high attention globally in personalized meal production and customized food design for its potential advantages over traditional processing. For a material to be printed it needs to be easily extruded from the nozzle of the printer and it needs to hold its structure after deposition. Additives such as thickening and gelling agents can be used for a food system to achieve suitable structure for printing. Various literature reports have demonstrated that rheological properties such as the storage modulus, yield stress, consistency index and flow behavior index can predict the printability of a material and 3D-printer parameters such as nozzle speed movement and layer height have an impact on the final quality of the printed structure. The present review provides a comprehensive overview of the impact of macronutrients printability and 3D-printer parameters on 3D-food printing, and offers new opportunities to bring 3D-food printing for personalized meal production closer to industry application.

AB In order to value J. glutinosa DC (rock tea), we characterised its phenolic profile and antioxidant activity. The study was performed in aqueous extracts before and after a simulated in vitro digestion to obtain data regarding phenolics bioavailability. Methanolic extracts were also analysed for comparison purposes. Phytochemical profiles were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection, whereas total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant assays were performed by conventional spectrophotometric methods. The most abundant compounds were dicaffeoylquinic acids, representing more than 90% of phenolics in tea infusions. Statistically significant differences were observed for all parameters except for TPC in methanol and aqueous extracts. Both phenolics amount and antioxidant activities were lower after the in vitro digestion of the infusions. However, although phenolics were lost during the simulated digestion, rock tea is still a good source of bioactive compounds with potential applications in the pharmaceutical or nutraceutical industries.

AB In this study, the degradation of tropane alkaloids in pasta under boiling (100 degrees C during 10 min) and tea making (100 degrees C and let cool 5 min) conditions has been evaluated for the first time. Pasta and green tea were contaminated with Datura Stramonium and Brugmansia Arborea seeds (pasta and green tea), whereas coca leaf tea was directly analysed. The compounds were extracted using solid-liquid extraction coupled to a preconcentration stage (only for the cooking water), and the compounds were analysed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (Exactive-Orbitrap analyser). Degradation studies indicate that concentration of tropane alkaloids decreases, and it depends on the compound, observing the highest degradation for tropinone, tropane, cuscohygrine and tropine, as well as it was observed that compounds migrated to the aqueous phase during cooking step. Finally, post-targeted analysis was performed and other tropane alkaloids were found, as scopine, tigloidine or convolvine, showing a similar behaviour under cooking conditions.

AB Growing demand for gelatin has increased interest in using alternative raw materials. In this study, different animal skins; namely frog, tuna and chicken skins; were utilized in gelatin extraction by previously optimized extraction procedures. Quality characteristics and functional properties of the resultant gelatins were comparatively investigated. Frog skin gelatin had the highest protein content with 77.8% while the highest hydroxyproline content was found in chicken skin gelatin with 6.4%. Frog skin gelatin showed a significantly higher melting point (42.7 degrees C) compared to tuna and chicken gelatins. Bloom value was also significantly higher in frog skin gelatin compared to that of chicken and tuna skin gelatins. Results showed that processing waste like skins of different animals may present opportunities in gelatin production as high quality alternatives. This study may help the industry by providing one hand comparable data over potentially significant sources.

AB The effect of winter savory (Satureja montana L.) essential oil (SEO) and supercritical extracts (SE1; SE2) at concentrations of 0.075 and 0.150 mu L/g on pH, lipid oxidation (TBARS), microbial growth and sensory quality of fresh pork sausages during storage were investigated. SEO, SE1 and SE2 improved oxidative and microbial stability of fresh pork sausages. The addition of SEO and SE1 at concentration of 0.150 mu L/g affected the reduction of total Enterobacteriaeceae count to under 3 log cfu/g. Sausages produced with SE1 and SE2 had a higher scores for odor, flavor and overall acceptance compared to sausages treated with SEO and control sample. Therefore, the results of this paper revealed significant antioxidative and antimicrobial activity of SE1 and SE2, and consequently its high potential of utilization in processing of fresh pork sausages.

AB The oxygen permeability and oxidative stability of fish oil-loaded electrosprayed capsules were studied by Electron Spin Resonance (ESR). Electrosprayed capsules with dextran as main biopolymer showed a significantly faster broadening (Delta H-pp) of 16-doxyl-stearate ESR spectrum when compared to glucose syrup capsules. This finding indicates a higher oxygen permeability of dextran capsules than glucose syrup capsules, which is explained by a reduced average free volume in the glucose syrup matrix than in the dextran shell. Moreover, glucose syrup capsules showed a significantly lower increase in the peak-to-peak amplitude of N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN) ESR spectrum during storage when compared to dextran capsules. This implies a higher oxidative stability of glucose syrup capsules than dextran capsules, which correlated well with the lower oxygen permeability of the former. These results indicated the importance of the oxygen barrier properties of the wall materials when encapsulating long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids by electrospraying.

AB Among the nutritional properties of microalgae, this study is focused in the presence of carotenoid esters in prokaryote microalgae, an event that has not been shown so far. Three carotenoid esters that accumulate in non-stressful culture conditions are identified in Aphanotece microscopica Nageli and Phormidum autumnale Gomont, what may provide an extra value to the quality attributes of the carotenoid profile in cyanobacteria as functional foods. In addition, new data on the carotenoid characterization added quality criteria for the identification of the esterified metabolites, enabling the monitoring of these food components. Specifically, the metabolomic approach applied to the food composition analysis, has allowed to differentiate between the esters of zeinoxanthin and beta-cryptoxanthin, which were undifferentiated to date during the MS characterization of carotenoids in other food sources. We propose a new qualifier product ion specific for zeinoxanthin ester, which it is not present in the MS2 spectrum of beta-cryptoxanthin esters.

AB A novel light-enhanced antimicrobial treatment was developed by exposing gallic acid (GA) to UV-C light. GA (15 mM) solution was exposed to UV-C for 30 min and subsequently incubated with E. coli O157: H7 for 30 min to achieve a 3.2 +/- 0.2 log CFU/mL reduction. The antimicrobial activity is affected by the irradiation duration, wavelength, and pH of solution. The addition of benzenesulfinic acid (BSA) to UV-C irradiated GA lowered (P < 0.05) its antimicrobial activity, indicating that quinones contributed to its overall antimicrobial effect. In addition, the attenuated (P < 0.05) antimicrobial activity of UV-C exposed GA in the presence of reactive oxidative species (ROS) quenchers, the generation of hydrogen peroxide, and increased levels of intracellular oxidative stress detected in E. coli O157:H7 illustrated that ROS also played a role in the antimicrobial effect of UV-C irradiated GA. UV-C irradiated GA could be applied as a novel antimicrobial in food systems.

AB The objective of this work was to study molecular binding of safranal to whey proteins by taking advantage of headspace solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography (HS-SPME/GC), fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies, and docking studies. The results of HS-SPME/GC indicated that bovine serum albumin (BSA) had the highest affinity toward safranal, with binding constant of 3.196x10(3) M-1. Also, binding strength was reduced in the order of a-lactalbumin (a-Lact), whey protein isolate (WPI), and beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg). Although there was a good agreement between results of HS-SPME/GC and fluorescence spectroscopy regarding the safranal binding site on whey proteins, the order of their binding affinity toward safranal was not consistent for both techniques. According to docking studies, conformational alterations in secondary and tertiary structures of whey proteins induced by safranal association resulted from hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds.

AB We studied seven known peptides derived from different food proteins, and one hydrophobic peptide derived through in-silico hydrolysis. We investigated their antioxidative, antimicrobial and haemolytic activities and their interactions with model lipid membranes. Our data reveal that peptides with histidines are the most effective for protection against lipid peroxidation, as: P#3 (VHHA) > P#5 (LHALLL) > P#7 (LLPHH). The most potent peptide towards metal-induced oxidation was P#2 (LQKW), which contained an aromatic tryptophan at its C-terminus. The peptides with negative hydrophobicity, as P#1 (PEL) and P#2 (LQKW), were the most potent according to DPPH radical scavenging. The most potent peptide towards superoxide radicals was the four-aminoacid chain with aromatic amino acids, P#2 (LQKW). The peptides studied did not show haemolytic or anti-microbial activities, except P#4 (AAGGV) against Listeria monocytogenes. These peptides did not interact with model lipid membranes, except P#8, which was designed to span lipid bilayers.

AB A rapid dispersive liquid-liquid micro-extraction (DLLME) with in-situ derivatization method for extraction and purification of aflatoxins (AFs) in vegetable oils was developed and evaluated. Oil extract, dichloromethane and trifluoroacetic acid were mixed and injected into water to form a cloudy solution. AFs in the oil were extracted into the numerous liquid droplets (with diameters from a few microns to dozens of microns) of extractant, where derivatization was carried out in situ. The proposed sample preparation method was coupled with high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) for determination of four AFs in vegetable oils. The method showed excellent linearity in three orders of magnitude, good relative recoveries, good repeatability and high sensitivity with limits of detection in range of 0.005-0.03 ng/mL. The accuracy of the method was also verified by certified reference sample. Finally, different kinds of vegetable oils from the local supermarket were analyzed.

AB Recently, new approaches for measuring antioxidant activity have been developed to eliminate or reduce the use of a spectrophotometer. All analytical methods must provide consistent and reliable results, which should be compared with statistical models. Therefore, we compared the conventional and dropping DPPH center dot methods with three widely used standards. We employed and compared with three statistical methods. Good R-squared (R-2= >= 0.96) confirmed the similarity in comparison of using dropping DPPH center dot method compared with the conventional DPPH center dot method and reported lower deviations (ARD= -0.32 to 0.13; RMSD= 0.10 to 1.15). Bland-Altman method (95% CI) demonstrated a good agreement between the two methods using standards and grape extracts (skin and seed). These findings suggested that the dropping DPPH center dot method proved cheaper (without spectrophotometer) and correlated well with the conventional DPPH center dot method. Therefore, this method could be affordably conducted in research laboratories in developing and less developed countries.

AB The degradation of cell wall polysaccharides is highly associated with the softening process of banana. In this work, banana was treated by morin to delay softening during storage. Water-soluble polysaccharides were extracted from banana pulp at four storage stages. Their levels increased when the banana was green, but decreased when turned to yellow. Three types of polysaccharides were identified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, including starches, homogalacturonans and arabinogalactan proteins. (1 -> 4)-alpha-D-galacturonan constructed the backbone of homogalacturonans, which was the leading water-soluble polysaccharide in the last stage. Starch was the dominant polysaccharide at all stages in morin-treated banana. Deassembly of insoluble starch granules and degradation of soluble starches were responsible for its high level in banana. Arabinogalactan proteins were only detected in late stages, and could be a marker for banana deterioration. The inhibited degradation of cell wall polysaccharides contributed to the preservative effect of morin.

AB In this work, a duplex PCR-Enzyme Linked Oligonucleotide Assay (ELONA) is reported for the sensitive and reliable detection of pork adulteration in beef and chicken products, two of the most widely consumed meat types in the world. The strategy relies on the use of species-specific tailed primers for duplex amplification and simple dilution of the PCR reactions for direct colorimetric detection via hybridization, eliminating the need for any other post-amplification steps. A high sensitivity was achieved, with as low as 71-188 pg of genomic DNA able to be detected using mixtures of control DNA from each species. The strategy was validated using DNA add-mixtures as well as DNA extracted from raw meat mixtures and 0.5-1% w/w pork could be easily detected when mixed with beef or chicken. The proposed approach is simple, sensitive and cost-effective compared to equivalent commercial kits suitable for detecting adulterant pork levels in meat products.

AB A novel hydrophobic-SERS substrate platform based on silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) functionalized commercially available filter paper was reported. Compared with conventional substrates, not only could this novel SERS substrate meet the requirements of simple and large-scale preparation, but also realized direct droplet-detection with reusable property. In this work, the fabrication, physical characterization, and SERS sensitivity of the substrates to spot-on food determination were studied. The experimental results show the method exhibited high reproducibility with less than 9% spot-to-spot variation in Raman intensity. Furthermore, the method was successfully applied to detect melamine in diluted milk with the instrument detection limit (IDL) down to 1 ppm in a linear correlation (1 ppm-1000 ppm). In addition, this SERS substrate could also be applied successfully in other fields, such as the determination of pesticide (thiram) and dye (malachite green) in real environment.

AB We investigated three-dimensional (3-D) fluorescence spectroscopy for its potential to evaluate beef quality deteriorative changes and freshness. The fluorescence characteristics of heme, conjugated Schiff base and amino acids, could be indicators of internal biochemical reactions associated with beef deterioration, including color changes, lipid oxidation, and protein degradation, as well as a measure of freshness decline. To classify beef quality in terms of color (sensory index) and pH (chemical index), cluster analysis method (CA) was used. Three classes were identified: "fresh", "acceptable", "spoiled". We then developed a qualitative model to classify stored beef into these three classes using 3-D front-face excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) of fat tissue, combined with a parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) algorithm. The resulting model had calibration and validation accuracies of 95.56% and 93.33%, respectively. These results demonstrate the potential of fluorescence spectroscopy to accurately and non-destructively monitor beef quality decline.

AB In this study, a sensitive and selective electrochemical sensing platform for the detection of Sudan I was developed with CuO nanoparticles-decorated 3D N-doped porous carbon (CuO/3DNPC). 3D N-doped porous carbon (3DNPC) was first prepared by calcining the precursors of 3D integrated polysaccharides, and then it was decorated with CuO nanoparticles by hydrothermal method. The CuO/3DNPC modified electrode showed high sensitivity and wide linear range for the detection of Sudan I due to the excellent electrocatalytic activity of CuO and the accelerated electron transfer by 3DNPC. In addition, the proposed CuO/3DNPC also exhibited high selectivity, high reproducibility and stability in the detection of Sudan I. Finally, the CuO/3DNPC based Sudan I sensor was applied in the detection of Sudan I in ketchup and chilli sauces, and the results demonstrated the potential of the developed CuO/3DNPC as a promising electrode material for accurate assay of Sudan I in food samples.

AB A magnetic solid-phase extraction method was developed using maghemite as an efficient sorbent for the separation and preconcentration of antimony prior to its determination by ET-AAS. Maghemite was synthesized through a simple method and characterized by XRD, FT-IR and SEM. Various factors affecting maghemite synthesis, separation and preconcentration of antimony such as desorption solvent type, concentration and volume, desorption temperature and time, sample pH, amount of sorbent, and extraction temperature and time were optimized. The effects of interfering ions were also investigated. Under optimized conditions, the method exhibited good linearity (r(2) > 0.9960). The sorption capacity and enrichment factor (EF) of the method were 37.5 mg g(-1) and 242, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.03 ng mL(-1). The intraday, interday, and batch-to-batch relative standard deviations (%RSDs) were quite reasonable. The proposed method was applied to various real samples and the relative recoveries found were between 95.8 and 104.0 %.

AB The cross-linking of myosin, an important property in meat processing, has previously been studied in complex myofibril systems to address free radical and microbial transglutaminase (MTG) effects. In the present study, purified myosin from pork Longissimus muscle was modified with H2O2 and 10 mu M Fe to determine the effects of oxidation on the subsequent cross-linking by MTG (E:S = 1:20) at 4 degrees C. When subjected to MTG, the degree of cross-linking in mildly oxidized myosin sample (1mM H2O2) reached 87.6%, compared to 64.7% in MTG-treated nonoxidized myosin and 33.8% in excessively oxidized myosin (200 mM H2O2), based on the epsilon(gamma-glutamyl)lysine bond, SDS-PAGE, and solubility analyses. Although S1 in myosin was always the principal cross-linking site, the S2 subfragment became a significant new region of cross-linking when stressed by 1mM H2O2. These findings may guide the MTG application in meat processing where oxidation is not inhibited.

AB Background: The incidence of cervical cancer has been increasing, especially in younger generation, in Japan. The females born between 1994 and 1999, who achieved rates of HPV vaccination approaching 70%, have become the target of cervical cancer screening programs. Here, we have analyzed the cervical cancer screening rates among the vaccinated and unvaccinated women.
   Methods: The survey data for cervical cancer screening at age 20 in FY 2015 was derived from two cities, Toyonaka and Iwaki.
   Results: Among 2,727 females, in Toyonaka and Iwaki, who were born in FY 1995 and targeted in FY 2015 at age 20 for cervical cancer screening, their HPV vaccination rate was 64.2% (1,753/2,727). The screening rate was 6.4% (112/1,753) in the vaccinated and 3.9% (38/974) in the unvaccinated. This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: We have demonstrated that HPV-vaccinated females tended to be effectively protected from future cervical cancer than the unvaccinated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Microarray patches (MAPs), also referred to as microneedle patches, are a novel methodology that have the potential to overcome barriers to vaccine delivery in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and transform the way that vaccines are delivered within immunization programs. The World Health Organization's Initiative for Vaccine Research and its partners are working to understand how MAPs could ease vaccine delivery and increase equitable access to vaccines in LMICs. Global stakeholders have been engaged to evaluate technical, economic, and programmatic challenges; to validate assumptions where possible; and to propose areas of focus to facilitate future vaccine-MAP product development. This report summarizes those learnings. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A promising new delivery technology, the microarray patch (MAPS) consists of an array of small solid coated or dissolvable needles, up to one mm in length, that administers a dry formulation of a vaccine or pharmaceutical. This study is not a real-life evaluation study but determines the anticipated acceptability of the Nanopatch (TM), a solid microarray patch device, in Benin, Nepal and Vietnam for vaccine delivery, and identifies factors that could improve the acceptability of the technology to increase measles immunization coverage.
   This study combined several evaluation methods, including simulation of vaccine administration on children and in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, healthcare workers, community health volunteers, caretakers, and community representatives.
   A total of 314 people participated in the study. The overall rate of total acceptability of the patch for child immunization was 92.7%. General opinions were very positive, providing clinical studies confirm that MAP administration is demonstrated to be painless, safe and effective for infectious disease prevention. The study participants were asked to consider the best strategy to introduce such vaccine delivery innovation. Firstly, delivery by skilled healthcare workers at the healthcare facilities will be preferred to establish the technology. Following this, administration by selected volunteers and outreach delivery may be possible, though under the supervision of skilled healthcare workers.
   This study's protocol received approval from the World Health Organization (WHO) Ethical Research Committee (ERC0002813) and the national IRB in Benin, Nepal and Vietnam. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phase 1 clinical trials with a DNA vaccine for dengue demonstrated that the vaccine is safe and well tolerated, however it produced less than optimal humoral immune responses. To determine if the immunogenicity of the tetravalent dengue DNA vaccine could be enhanced, we explored alternate, yet to be tested, methods of vaccine administration in non-human primates. Animals were vaccinated on days 0, 28 and 91 with either a low (1 mg) or high (5 mg) dose of vaccine by the intradermal or intramuscular route, using either needle-free injection or electroporation devices. Neutralizing antibody, IFN-gamma T cell and memory B cell responses were compared to a high dose group vaccinated with a needle-free intramuscular injection delivery device similar to what had been used in previous preclinical and clinical studies. All previously untested vaccination methodologies elicited improved immune responses compared to the high dose needle-free intramuscular injection delivery group. The highest neutralizing antibody responses were observed in the group that was vaccinated with the high dose formulation via intradermal electroporation. The highest IFN-gamma T cell responses were also observed in the high dose intradermal electroporation group and the CD8(+) T cells were the dominant contributors for the IFN gamma response. Memory B cells were detected for all four serotypes. More than a year after vaccination, groups were challenged with dengue-1 virus. Both the low and high dose intradermal electroporation groups had significantly fewer days of dengue-1 virus RNAemia compared to the control group. The results from this study demonstrate that using either an electroporation device and/or the intradermal route of delivery increases the immune response generated by this vaccine in non-human primates and should be explored in humans.

ID POLYSACCHARIDE VACCINE; HESITANCY; COVERAGE; PEOPLE; ADULTS
AB Background: Influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations reduce adverse health outcomes in older adults. The Australian National Immunisation Program (NIP) provides free seasonal influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations for adults >= 65 y. Guidelines recommend all adults >= 65 y receive one dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPPV) regardless of their risk of invasive pneumococcal disease. However, the reported rate of vaccination against pneumococcal disease is much lower than seasonal influenza. Identifying and understanding the perspective of older people on vaccination is important to informing effective promotional strategies for this age group.
   Methods: Using a purposive and snowball recruitment strategy, 36 participants aged between 65 and 84 years of age were recruited in south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales. Face-to-face qualitative interviews conducted between July 2017 and January 2018 were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed.
   Results: In this sample, the uptake of the influenza vaccine (n = 28, 78%) was greater than for the pneumococcal vaccine (n = 14, 39%). Five key themes identified were health practitioner influence; anti-vaccination influence; social responsibility; work-based vaccination; and perceptions of age. The influences on uptake were complex and multi-faceted.
   Conclusions: Findings provide new insights, in particular, the role of social responsibility, the long-term impact of workplace vaccinations, and how older people do not necessarily consider themselves old. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine MenACWY-CRM has been shown to be immunogenic and well-tolerated in infants and toddlers. We evaluated antibody persistence for up to 4 years after vaccination with MenACWY-CRM in the first years of life and response to a booster dose administered at 60 months of age.
   Methods: This was phase 3b, open-label, multicenter extension trial (NCT01148017). We assessed by hSBA and rSBA the persistence of antibody responses to serogroups ACWY in 203 healthy 60-month-olds receiving 4 doses of MenACWY-CRM during infancy (ACWY-4 group), or 2 doses at 12/13 and 15 months or 1 dose at 18 months of age (ACWY-2 group). We administered a MenACWY-CRM dose to 224 primed and 45 naive 60-month-olds and evaluated safety and antibody response 1 month later.
   Results: Antibody persistence measured by both assays was higher in primed than naive 60-month-olds. The percentages of primed children with hSBA titers >= 8 was low for serogroup A (6-25%) and moderate for serogroups C (27-43%), Y (69-74%) and W (56-69%). For all serogroups, hSBA antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) tended to be higher in the ACWY-2 than the ACWY-4 group. Post-booster/single dose, >= 96% of primed and >= 73% of naive children had hSBA titers >= 8 against each serogroup, and hSBA GMTs were higher in primed children. The booster dose was well-tolerated and no safety concern was identified. We further assessed persistence using rSBA across different age groups and detected no overall correlation between rSBA and hSBA titers.
   Conclusions: Primary vaccination of infants/toddlers with MenACWY-CRM resulted in moderate antibody persistence against serogroups C, W and Y for up to 4 years after the last priming dose. Regardless of priming schedule, a MenACWY-CRM booster dose at 60 months of age induced a robust immune response against all serogroups and was well-tolerated in all children.

AB In both preclinical animal studies and human clinical trials, adult females tend to develop greater adaptive immune responses than males following receipt of either viral or bacterial vaccines. While there is currently no approved malaria vaccine, several anti-sporozoite vaccines, including RTS,S/AS01 and attenuated sporozoite vaccines, are in development, but the impact of sex and age on their efficacy remains undefined. To examine sex differences in the efficacy of anti-sporozoite stage malaria vaccination, adult (10 weeks of age) or juvenile (11 days of age) male and female C3H mice were twice vaccinated with irradiated transgenic Plasmodium berghei sporozoites expressing the P. falciparum circumsporozoite (CSP) protein and 45 days post boost vaccination, mice were challenged with transgenic P. berghei via mosquito bite or intradermal challenge. Immunization with irradiated sporozoites resulted in greater protection against challenge in adult females, which was associated with greater anti-CSP antibody production and avidity, as well as greater hepatic, but not splenic, CD8(+) T cell IFNy production in adult females than adult males. No sex differences in adaptive immune responses or protection were observed in mice vaccinated prior to puberty, suggesting a role for sex steroid hormones. Depletion of testosterone in males increased, whereas rescue of testosterone decreased, anti-CSP antibody production, the number of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells isolated from the liver, and protection following parasite challenge. Conversely, depletion of sex steroids in female mice did not alter vaccine induced responses or protection following challenge. These data suggest that elevated testosterone concentrations in males reduce adaptive immunity and contribute to sex differences in malaria vaccine efficacy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The high global burden of tuberculosis (TB) underscores the urgent need for an effective TB vaccine since the only licensed Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is ineffective in preventing adult pulmonary TB and affords no protection against latent TB infection (LTBI). Herein we investigated the potential of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) antigen proteins AEC comprised of Ag85b and ESAT6-CFP10 proteins in conjunction with aluminum (Al) and polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly-IC) as a novel subunit vaccine against TB. The immunogenicity and protection induced by the adjuvanted vaccine were evaluated in two animal models. Mice vaccinated with AEC/Al/poly-IC exhibited significant antigen-specific humoral immune responses and cell-mediated immunity as determined by immunoassay and multicolor flow cytometric assay, and the protective effect of the vaccine was demonstrated in a guinea pig model of latent Mtb infection. Compared to the control group, the mean pathological scores and bacterial loads in lungs and spleens of AEC/Al/poly-IC-immunized guinea pigs were significantly reduced. These data indicate that the AEC/Al/poly-IC is highly immunogenic in mice and can effectively protect guinea pigs against latent Mtb infection; it may represent a promising candidate vaccine for the control of latent TB.

AB Low moisture content is seen as crucial to achieving long term stability of freeze dried biologics and reference materials. Highly hygroscopic freeze-dried material are susceptible to moisture ingress over time which can lead to degradation and loss of biological potency. This study compared vials with unprocessed stoppers, vials with vacuum-oven dried stoppers and glass ampoules in order to determine the superior long term storage format in terms of moisture ingress and potency. B/Phuket influenza antigen was chosen as the model biological standard and the lyophilized antigen was stored at -20, 25 and 45 degrees C over a 1 year period. Ampoules had no significant moisture change across all storage temperatures as would be anticipated. Moisture content results at -20 degrees C showed no significant differences between ampoules, vials with vacuum-oven dried stoppers and vials with unprocessed stoppers over 12 months. Vials with vacuum-oven dried stoppers performed similarly to ampoules at -20 degrees C and 20 degrees C, but had a small increase in moisture content after 6 months at 45 degrees C. Vials with unprocessed stoppers preformed the worst and exhibited the largest moisture ingress after just 3 months at both 20 degrees C and 45 degrees C. Single radial immunodiffusion (SRD) potency assays showed at -20 degrees C and 20 degrees C there was no significant difference between all closure formats. At 45 degrees C there was a drop in potency for all closure formats, but ampoules and vials with vacuum-oven dried stoppers retained higher potency than vials with unprocessed stoppers. Thus, while ampoules are still considered to be the gold standard format for long term storage stability, using vials with vacuum-oven dried stoppers provides comparable stability and moisture integrity at -20 degrees C and 20 degrees C storage.

AB Background: The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced into the UK childhood immunisation programme in 2006 and replaced with a 13-valent vaccine (PCV13) in 2010. Both vaccines led to rapid declines in vaccine-serotype invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Here, we assessed the long-term vaccine-effectiveness (VE) of both vaccines in England.
   Methods: Public Health England conducts enhanced national surveillance of IPD in England. VE against IPD was estimated using vaccine-serotype IPD cases and non-vaccine serotype IPD controls among vaccine-eligible children from September 2006 to June 2018 (the Broome method).
   Results: Vaccine history was available for 3421 IPD cases, including 1299 due to the additional PCV13 serotypes and the PCV13-related serotype 6C, 274 PCV7 serotypes and 1848 non-PCV13 serotypes. For the complete 2 + 1 schedule, both PCV7 and PCV13 showed high effectiveness against PCV7 serotypes with a combined VE of 92.0% (95%CI, 81.7-96.7). For the 2 + 1 schedule, PCV13 VE against the additional PCV13 serotypes plus 6C was 73.7% (31.1-89.9) compared to 90.0% (75.3 - 96.0) for PCV7 against PCV7 serotypes, although PCV13 VE increased to 84.8% (58.7-94.4) if serotype 3 was excluded; all 36 eligible serotype 3 IPD cases were fully-vaccinated with PCV13. Case numbers were low in older ages but there was evidence of waning, which was significant for serotype 19A for which there were sufficient numbers of cases for analysis.
   Conclusions: PCVs are highly effective in preventing vaccine-serotype IPD except for serotype 3 which has been increasing in incidence. Serotype 19A IPD has also persisted, likely due to a slightly lower VE and/or more rapid waning of protection. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE Influenza; High-dose vaccine; Economic assessment
ID SEASONAL INFLUENZA; HEALTH-CARE; ADULTS; OLDER; VA
AB Objective: To compare the economic impact of high-dose trivalent (HD) versus standard-dose trivalent (SD) influenza vaccination on direct medical costs for cardio-respiratory hospitalizations in adults aged 65 years or older enrolled in the United States (US) Veteran's Health Administration (VHA).
   Methods: Leveraging a relative vaccine effectiveness study of HD versus SD over five respiratory seasons (2010/11 through 2014/15), we collected cost data for healthcare provided to the same study population both at VHA and through Medicare services. Our economic assessment compared the costs of vaccination and hospital care for patients experiencing acute cardio-vascular or respiratory illness.
   Results: We analyzed 3.5 million SD and 158,636 HD person-seasons. The average cost of HD and SD vaccination was $23.48 (95% CI: $21.29 - $25.85) and $12.21 (95% CI: $11.49 - $13.00) per recipient, respectively, while the hospitalization rates for cardio-respiratory disease in HD and SD recipients were 0.114 (95% CI: 0.108-0.121) and 0.132 (95% CI: 0.132-0.133) per person-season, respectively. Attributing the average cost per hospitalization of $11,796 (95% CI: $11,685 - $11,907) to the difference in hospitalization rates, we estimated savings attributable to HD to be $202 (95% CI: $115 - $280) per vaccinated recipient.
   Conclusions: For the five-season period of 2010/11 through 2014/15, HD influenza vaccination was associated with net cost savings due to fewer hospitalizations, and therefore lower direct medical costs, for cardio-respiratory disease as compared to SD influenza vaccination in the senior US VHA population.

AB Background: Infectious diseases can differ by sex in their incidence, prevalence, or severity of disease. These differences may be induced by sex-dependent immune responses and resulting protection, for example after vaccination. Therefore, this study aims to assess possible sex-differences in immunoglobulin levels (IgG) after infant and childhood vaccination.
   Methods: Data from a national cross-sectional serosurvey conducted in 2006/2007 were used (Pienter 2). We compared IgG levels against measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C (MenC) between girls and boys both short term (1 month to 1 year) and long term (1-3 year) after infant and childhood vaccinations, using linear regression analysis. Proportions of boys and girls reaching a protective IgG level were compared using Fishers exact test.
   Results: Differences in IgG were found at specific time points after vaccination against measles, mumps, rubella, MenC, and polio. The geometric mean concentration or titer (GMC/T) girls:boys ratios ranged between 1.10 for polio type 1 <1 year after the first childhood booster to 1.90 for MenC <1 year after infant vaccination, indicating higher antibody levels in girls. No significant differences were found between boys and girls for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib at either time point. Proportions with protective levels differed only at 1-3 years after infant vaccination for mumps (82.5% boys vs. 91.9% girls, p = 0.046), and at the same time point for MenC (7.0% boys vs. 18.2% girls, p = 0.015), and polio type 1 (87.8% boys vs. 95.9% girls, p = 0.047).
   Conclusion: Differences in IgG between boys and girls were generally small and not consistent, neither between pathogens nor within pathogens. If differences were observed, girls were favored over boys. On the whole, the results suggest that there are no major sex differences in protection from the studied pathogens in the Netherlands.

TI Differences between coverage of yellow fever vaccine and the first dose
   of measles-containing vaccine: A desk review of global data sources
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Review
DE Yellow fever vaccine; Stock outs; Routine immunization coverage; Measles
   vaccine
AB Introduction: The strategy to Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) is a global initiative that includes all countries with risk of yellow fever (YF) virus transmission. Of these, 40 countries (27 in Africa and 13 in the Americas) are considered high-risk and targeted for interventions to increase coverage of YF vaccine. Even though the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that YF vaccine be given concurrently with the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) in YF-endemic settings, estimated coverage for MCV1 and YF vaccine have varied widely. The objective of this study was to review global data sources to assess discrepancies in YF vaccine and MCV1 coverage and identify plausible reasons for these discrepancies.
   Methods: We conducted a desk review of data from 34 countries (22 in Africa, 12 in Latin America), from 2006 to 2016, with national introduction of YF vaccine and listed as high-risk by the EYE strategy. Data reviewed included procured and administered doses, immunization schedules, routine coverage estimates and reported vaccine stock-outs. In the 30 countries included in the comparitive analysis, differences greater than 3 percentage points between YF vaccine and MCV1 coverage were considered meaningful.
   Results: In America, there were meaningful differences (7-45%) in coverage of the two vaccines in 6 (67%) of the 9 countries. In Africa, there were meaningful differences (4-27%) in coverage of the two vaccines in 9 (43%) of the 21 countries. Nine countries (26%) reported MVC1 stock-outs while sixteen countries (47%) reported YF vaccine stock-outs for three or more years during 2006-2016.
   Conclusion: In countries reporting significant differences in coverage of the two vaccines, differences may be driven by different target populations and vaccine availability. However, these were not sufficient to completely explain observed differences. Further follow-up is needed to identify possible reasons for differences in coverage rates in several countries where these could not fully be explained. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) causes various disease syndromes in cattle including respiratory disease and abortions. During an investigation into the potential role of BoHV-1 modified-live vaccines (MLV) causing diseases in cattle, we performed whole genome sequencing on six BoHV-1 field strains isolated at Cornell Animal Health Diagnostic Center in the late 1970s. Three isolates (two respiratory and a fetal) were identified as vaccine-derived isolates, having SNP patterns identical to that of a previously sequenced MLV virus that exhibited a deleted US2 and truncated US1.67 genes. Two other isolates (a respiratory and a fetal) were categorized as wild-type (WT) viruses based on their unique SNP pattern that is distinct from MLV viruses. The sixth isolate from an aborted fetus was a recombinant virus with 62% of its genome exhibiting SNPs identical to one of the above-mentioned WT viruses also recovered from an aborted fetus. The remaining 38% consisted of two blocks of sequences derived from the MLV virus. The first block replaced the UL9-UL19 region, and the second vaccine-derived sequence block encompassed all the genes within the unique short region and the internal/terminal repeats containing the regulatory genes BICP4 and BICP22. This is confirmatory evidence that recombination between BoHV-1 MLV and WT viruses can occur under natural conditions and cause disease. It is important in that it underscores the potential for the glycoprotein E negative (gE(-)) marker vaccine used to eradicate BoHV-1 in some countries, to recombine with virulent field strains allowing them to capture the gE(-) marker, thereby endangering the control and eradication programs.

AB The present study is the first to examine associations between area-level socio-demographic factors and uptake of vaccination among 5-year old children throughout Australia. A public-health focused ecological methodology was used that combined postcode-level socio-demographic variables from the 2016 Census with postcode-level vaccination data. Analyses included one-way analysis of variance and assessment of linear trends for each socio-demographic variable across five categories of vaccination rate; ranging from lowest (<= 90%) to highest (96.1-100%), as well as using vaccination rate as a continuous variable. Multiple regression analysis was also conducted using select indicators to predict vaccination rates in postcodes from major cities. The results of the univariate analyses showed that communities with lower rates of vaccination had relatively less disadvantage, and had relatively greater education and occupation status, as measured by SEIFA (ABS [4]). When we looked at the ASGS Remoteness Areas, we saw that the vaccination rates were lowest in postcodes from the major cities of Australia, and vaccination rates increased as communities became more remote. When the community is further refined to postcodes located in the major cities, and to the target group of parents/partners in a family with children aged 4-7, we found that postcodes with lower vaccination rates were characterised as having a relatively greater proportion of people with: a high education level (bachelor degree level or higher); having white-collar jobs as managers; having no religion, having people in the older age category (50-54); and conversely being unemployed.

AB t Both influenza A and B viruses cause outbreaks of seasonal influenza resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. There are two antigenically distinct lineages of influenza B virus, Yamagata lineage (YL) and Victoria lineage (VL). Since both B lineages have been co-circulating for years, more than 70% of influenza vaccines currently manufactured are quadrivalent consisting of influenza A (H1N1), influenza A (H3N2), influenza B (YL) and influenza B (VL) antigens. Although quadrivalent influenza vaccines tend to elevate immunity to both influenza B lineages, estimated overall vaccine efficacy against influenza B is still only around 42%. Thus, a more effective influenza B vaccine is needed.
   To meet this need, we generated BM2-deficient, single-replication (BM2SR) influenza B vaccine viruses that encode surface antigens from influenza B/Wisconsin/01/2010 (B/WI01, YL) and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B/Bris60, VL) viruses. The BM2SR-WI01 and BM2SR-Bris60 vaccine viruses are replication-deficient in vitro and in vivo, and can only replicate in a cell line that expresses the complementing BM2 protein. Both BM2SR viruses were non-pathogenic to mice, and vaccinated animals showed elevated mucosal and serum antibody responses to both Yamagata and Victoria lineages in addition to cellular responses. Serum antibody responses included lineage-specific hemagglutinin inhibition antibody (HAI) responses as well as responses to the stem region of the hemagglutinin (HA). BM2SR vaccine viruses provided apparent sterilizing immunity to mice against intra- and inter-lineage drifted B virus challenge. The data presented here support the feasibility of BM2SR as a platform for next-generation trivalent influenza vaccine development. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB During the 2013-2014 influenza season, the quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (QLAIV), had lower than expected vaccine effectiveness (VE) against circulating A/H1N1pdm09 viruses in the USA. The underlying reason proposed for this was that the A/H1N1pdm09 vaccine strain, A/California/07/2009 (A/CA09), had a thermally unstable haemagglutinin (HA) protein. Consequently, a new A/H1N1pdm09 candidate strain, A/Bolivia/559/2013 (A/BOL13), was developed for inclusion in the 2015-2016 QLAIV. A key parameter for selection of A/BOL13 was its more thermostable HA phenotype compared with A/CA09. During the 2015-2016 season, QLAIV containing A/BOL13 was found in some studies to have improved, but still with suboptimal, VE against circulating A/H1N1pdm09 viruses and was not recommended for use by the CDC in the US market in the 2016-2017 influenza season. This suggested that improved HA thermostability had not entirely resolved the reduced VE observed. One hypothesis for this was that, by improving thermostability, the A/BOL13 HA protein had been over-stabilised, compromising its activation at the low endosomal pH required for successful viral entry. Here we demonstrate that, while the A/BOL13 HA protein is more stable than that of A/CA09, its thermal and pH stability were comparable with historically efficacious LAIV strains, suggesting that the HA had not been over-stabilised. Furthermore, studies simulating potential heat exposure during distribution by exposing QLAIV nasal sprayers to 33 degrees C for 4 h showed that, while remaining within product specification, A/CA09 viral potency was statistically decreased after 12 weeks at 2-8 degrees C. These data suggest that although unfavourable HA protein stability may have contributed to the reduced VE of A/CA09 in 2013-2014, it was unlikely to have affected A/BOL13 in 2015-2016. We conclude that HA stability was not the primary cause of the reduced effectiveness of LAIV against A/H1N1pdm09 viruses in the 2013-2014 and 2015-2016 seasons. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Background: A previous cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) showed that Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) 10 and PCV13 were not cost-effective for universal immunization among children in Thailand. Given recent changes in the evidence of efficacy, herd effects and price, a CEA of PCVs should be revisited. This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of PCV10 and PCV13 compared to no PCV vaccination in Thai children.
   Material and methods: A Markov model was developed under a societal perspective with a lifetime horizon. Inputs were derived from a comprehensive literature review. Costs were calculated using the Thai National Electronic Database and converted to the year 2017 value. All costs and outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3%. The findings were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in Thai Baht (THB) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analyses were performed. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was generated with the cost-effectiveness threshold of 160,000 THB/QALY.
   Results: Base-case analysis of 2 + 1 dose schedule and five-year protection, with no consideration of herd effect showed that 10ER for PCV10 was 170,437 THB/QALY, while ICER for PCV13 was 73,674 THB/QALY. With consideration of herd effect, both PCV10 and PCV13 had lower costs and higher QALYs compared to no PCV vaccination. Based on our probabilistic sensitivity analysis at willingness-to-pay of 160,000 THB/QALY, PCVI3 had 93% of being cost-effective, while 4.7% and 2.3%, for PCV10 and no PCV vaccination, respectively.
   Conclusion: At current prices, PCV13 is cost-effective, while PCV10 is not cost-effective in Thailand. When considering herd-effect, both PCV10 and PCV13 are cost-effective. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Determining a recommended dosage schedule is a crucial component of vaccine administration, and is often subject to reassessment. Ideally, recommendations will be supported by multiple arm clinical trials. However, the considerable cost in both resources and time means that a method of predicting post vaccine humoral antibody levels associated with a hypothetical schedule using data collected from a currently implemented schedule would be of significant benefit to vaccination practice.
   In this paper we propose such a methodology, which permits statistical estimation of the population mean and standard deviation of log transformed antibody titers of various post-vaccination time points of a hypothetical schedule, using a longitudinal sample of antibody titers from an observed schedule. The method is based on the decomposition of humoral antibody kinetic history into distinct phases, for example, peak phase, decay phase and post-booster phase. The method is feasible because each phase has its own discernable kinetic laws. Of particular interest will be estimation of antibody levels immediately preceding a booster dose (typically the lowest level attained during the schedule), and the antibody levels following a booster dose.

AB Background: Safe, effective vaccines are given to pregnant women to protect their infants and/or themselves against certain infectious agents; however, apart from tetanus vaccination, maternal immunization in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains low. Tetanus toxoid vaccine is integrated into antenatal care services in Malawi with high coverage and provides an opportunity to identify factors that facilitate successful immunization delivery to pregnant women in LMICs.
   Methods: PATH and the University of Malawi's Centre for Social Research conducted a mixed-methods study in 2015 to document community perceptions of maternal immunization, using tetanus vaccine as an example, and to identify factors perceived to be important to successfully introducing other maternal vaccines, such as influenza vaccine, in Malawi. We conducted 18 focus group discussions with pregnant and recently pregnant women and their family members and 76 semi-structured interviews with pregnant and recently pregnant women, community leaders, health workers, public health program managers, non-governmental partners, and policy makers.
   Results: We identified factors perceived to support the introduction of new maternal vaccines, including strong maternal vaccine acceptance in the community, an existing strategy for maternal tetanus vaccine delivery, and positive health workers' views about the introduction of additional maternal vaccines. Potential challenges to adoption and acceptance included identifying and tracking the target population and monitoring adverse events, and the need to ensure operational capacity of the health system to support the introduction and wide-scale use of an additional vaccine. For influenza vaccine specifically, additional challenges included limited awareness of influenza disease and its low prioritization among health needs.
   Conclusions: Lessons from the successful delivery of maternal tetanus immunization in Malawi may be informative for similar countries considering new vaccines for pregnant women or striving to optimize the delivery of those currently provided. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Measles-associated deaths have been reported in infants <9 months during outbreaks. A cohort study was conducted on 210 infants aged 6-8 months to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the AIK-C measles vaccine containing 10(4.21) plaque-forming units (PFU)/0.5 mL produced in Vietnam. Paired serum samples were obtained from 196 subjects. Seropositivity was defined as >= 120 mIU/mL. The seroresponse rate was 173/196 (88.27%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 83.77-92.77%) with geometric mean titer (GMT) of 511 mIU/mL (95% CI: 688-880 mIU/mL), and no significant differences were observed by different age groups. Among 196 paired sera, they were categorized into four groups: 122 subjects <14 IU/mL, 28 subjects 14-<60 mIU/mL, 30 subjects 60-<120 mIU/mL, and 16 subjects >= 120 mIU/mL. The seroresponse rate was 112/122 (91.8%, 95% CI: 86.94-96.67%) with GMT (597 mIU/mL, 95% CI: 749-1002 mIU/mL) in the <14 mIU/L group. In the 14-<60 mIU/mL group, the seroresponse rate was 18/28 (64.29%) with 184 mIU/L of GMT and was significantly lower (p < 0.01) than that in the <14 mIU/mL group. In the 16 seropositive group, all subjects showed seroconversion (4-fold higher than before) with a higher GMT of 1078 mIU/mL. Local pain and itching at the injection site were observed in 8 subjects (3.8%) within 7 days of the vaccination. Regarding systemic adverse reactions, febrile illness >= 37.5 degrees C was observed in 14 subjects (6.7%). These results indicate that the AIK-C measles vaccine is effective and safe for infants aged 6-8 months and will contribute to reducing the number of measles-associated deaths in future outbreaks.

DE Hepatitis E vaccine; Clinical trial; Elderly people; Safety;
   Immunogenicity
ID HPV VACCINE
AB Background: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is a leading cause of acute hepatitis worldwide, and results in high morbidity and mortality rates among elderly people in China. The hepatitis E vaccine, Hecolin (R), has been shown to be safe and highly efficacious among healthy adults aged 16-65 years old. However, there is no data about Hecolin (R) vaccination in elderly people older than 65 years (y).
   Methods: An open-labeled, controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Hecolin (R) among the elderly aged >65 y. A total of 601 eligible participants were enrolled. Among them, 200 elderly people aged >65 y and 201 adults aged 18-65 y were assigned to the Hecolin (R) groups and vaccinated at day 0, month 1 and month 6. Serum samples were collected for anti-HEV IgG determination at day 0 prior to immunization and at month 7. The remaining 200 elderly people aged >65 y were assigned to the safety control group and received no intervention but were instructed to report any adverse events that occurred during the whole study period in the same way as those in the Hecolin (R) groups.
   Results: After receiving 3 doses of Hecolin (R) with the standard schedule, most (96.7%) of the vaccinated elderly people aged >65 y seroconverted at one month after the final dose (month 7). At month 7, the geometric mean concentrations of anti-HEV IgG were 5.36 (95% CI, 3.88-7.41) and 19.65 (95% CI, 16.81-22.98) among the baseline seronegative and seropositive elderly, respectively. Of the vaccinated elderly, 97.3% (177/182) had anti-HEV IgG levels higher than 1.0 WU/ml at month 7. Hecolin (R) was very well tolerated in this population. No vaccine-related SAES were reported.
   Conclusions: Hecolin (R) is immunogenic and well tolerated in elderly people aged greater than 65 years. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The objective of the present study was to investigate the risk factors for intussusception (IS) among infants, including vaccination against rotavirus.
   Methods: Case-control study with systematic inclusion of all infants aged <1 year with suspected IS admitted to emergency departments in the eastern region of France between 1 April 2008 and 31 March 2012. All cases classed level 1 according to the Brighton classification were matched to 4 hospital controls. Two exposure windows were examined; exposure to the first dose of rotavirus vaccine in the 7 and in the 14 days prior to the occurrence of IS.
   Results: A total of 115 cases were matched with 457 controls. The average vaccination coverage rate over the 4 years of study was 8.6%. Rotavirus vaccine was not found to be significantly associated with the occurrence of IS in the 7 days (odds ratio (OR) not calculated; p = 0.99) and in the 14 days after administration of one dose vaccine (OR 1.33, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 0.14-12.82). Infant formula alone or combined with breastfeeding was associated with an excess risk of IS (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.10-6.79). A history of gastroenteritis within 2 weeks prior to hospitalisation was also associated with an increased risk (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.07-4.67).
   Conclusion: Our study indicates that infant formula alone or combined with breastfeeding is a risk factor for IS. A small, non-significant increase in the risk of IS was observed after rotavirus vaccination, although the low vaccine coverage rate likely precluded detection of a significant increase in risk.

AB Purpose: Carrot Rewards is a free, incentive-based, smartphone health app available in participating provinces in Canada. One feature of Carrot was designed to incentivize influenza vaccine education messages and encourage vaccine uptake for users in the province of British Columbia. This study aimed to evaluate the uptake of the Carrot Flu Campaign educational quiz and to determine if mobile "push" notifications, plus loyalty point incentives, resulted in users visiting a sponsored pharmacy to discuss and receive the influenza vaccine.
   Methods: The Carrot Flu Campaign delivered an in-app quiz, educating users on the importance of the influenza vaccine. Push notifications were then sent to users when they came within 200 m of a sponsored pharmacy. Those who visited the pharmacy collected bonus points and completed a follow up quiz tracking influenza vaccine behaviour. A sub-sample of users completed the Flu Campaign between their baseline and follow up Health Risk Assessment (HRA), a survey which asked about influenza vaccine uptake behaviour. Descriptive statistics were summarized.
   Results: A total of 38.1% (30,538/80,228) registered Carrot users completed the Flu Campaign quiz. Of those in participating cities (n = 21,469), 41% clicked on the map to show the nearest sponsored pharmacy and 78% enabled their smartphone's "locations" feature, allowing them to receive the push notifications. A small number of users spoke to a pharmacist (n = 96) and less than half reported receiving the influenza vaccine (38/96; 39.6%). From the HRA sub-sample (n = 3693), approximately 5% more users reported receiving the influenza vaccine during the 2017 influenza season compared to the previous year.
   Conclusions: Carrot Rewards used a novel delivery method to educate the general population and showed geolocation could be used to facilitate influenza vaccine uptake. Future iterations could tailor content to target those most at risk and should consider more robust evaluation methods to determine the app's effectiveness. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The recombinant yellow fever-17D-dengue virus, live, attenuated, tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) is licensed in several dengue-endemic countries. Although the vaccine provides protection against dengue, the level of protection differs by serotype and warrants further investigation. We characterized the antigenic properties of each vaccine virus serotype using highly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) that bind quaternary structure-dependent epitopes. Specifically, we monitored the binding of dengue virus-1 (DENY-1; 1F4), DENV-2 (2D22) or DENV-3 (5J7) serotype-specific or DENY-1-4 cross-reactive (1C19) hmAbs to the four chimeric yellow fever-dengue vaccine viruses (CYD-1-4) included in phase Ill vaccine formulations using a range of biochemical and functional assays (dot blot, ELISA, surface plasmon resonance and plaque reduction neutralization assays). In addition, we used the "classic" live, attenuated DENV-2 vaccine serotype, immature CYD-2 viruses and DENV-2 virus-like particles as control antigens for anti-serotype-2 reactivity. The CYD vaccine serotypes were recognized by each hmAbs with the expected specificity, moreover, surface plasmon resonance indicated a high functional affinity interaction with the CYD serotypes. In addition, the hmAbs provided similar protection against CYD and wild type dengue viruses in the in vitro neutralization assay. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the four CYD viruses used in clinical trials display key conformational and functional epitopes targeted by serotype-specific and/or cross-reactive neutralizing human antibodies. More specifically, we showed that CYD-2 displays serotype-specific epitopes present only on the mature virus. This indicates that the CYDTDV has the ability to elicit antibody specificities which are similar to those induced by the wild type DENY. Future investigations will be needed to address the nature of CYD-TDV-induced responses after vaccine administration, and how these laboratory markers relate to vaccine efficacy and safety.

AB Over the last three years an unprecedented flow of migrants arrived in Europe. There is evidence that vaccine preventable diseases have caused outbreaks in migrant holding centres. These outbreaks can be favored by a combination of factors including low immunization coverage, bad conditions that migrants face during their exhausting journey and overcrowding within holding facilities. In 2017, we conducted an online survey in Croatia, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal and Slovenia to explore the national immunization strategies targeting irregular migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. All countries stated that a national regulation supporting vaccination offer to migrants is available. Croatia, Italy, Portugal and Slovenia offer to migrant children and adolescents all vaccinations included in the National Immunization Plan; Greece and Malta offer only certain vaccinations, including those against diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, poliomyelitis and measles-mumps-rubella. Croatia, Italy, Malta and Portugal also extend the vaccination offer to adults. All countries deliver vaccinations in holding centres and/or community health services, no one delivers vaccinations at entry site. Operating procedures that guarantee the migrants' access to vaccination at the community level are available only in Portugal. Data on administered vaccines is available at the national level in four countries: individual data in Malta and Croatia, aggregated data in Greece and Portugal. Data on vaccination uptake among migrants is available at national level only in Malta. Concluding, although diversified, strategies for migrant vaccination are in place in all the surveyed countries and generally in line with WHO and ECDC indications. Development of procedures to keep track of migrants' immunization data across countries, development of strategies to facilitate and monitor migrants' access to vaccinations at the community level and collection of data on vaccination uptake among migrants should be promoted to meet existing gaps.

AB The importance of childhood immunization in prevention of highly fatal diseases and disability cannot be overemphasized. Pakistan has a national Expanded Program on Immunization but the compliance is far below the international benchmark for achieving a herd immunity. Monitoring the compliance to timely receipt of vaccinations is crucial to establishing and preventing disease and disability associated risk in children. There is little or no evidence that reports the timeliness of the vaccinations according to the EPI schedule in Peshawar. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate rate of Fully Immunized Children and to report compliance to the timeliness of vaccine specific schedule during the study period in the EPI center in the capital city of Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. We collected consecutive retrospective data of the infants enrolled from June 2014 to December 2015 in one EPI center for our study. Out of the total 157 (n) children, fully immunized children (FIC) were 62 (39.5%) and only 19 (12.1%) were FIC with timely visits. Dropouts increased with successive vaccinations with highest for Measles 1 (42%). On-time vaccinations decreased over time, while the proportion of children receiving vaccination outside the ideal window period reaches as high as 46%. The study reports a low compliance to EPI schedule, and also highlights that immunization coverage is not a good indicator of age appropriate vaccinations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Tick borne encephalitis (TBE) endemic zones are expanding. We previously evaluated long term persistence of antibody 5 years after the first booster immunization following different primary immunization schedules with the polygeline-free inactivated TBE vaccine (TBEvac) in adults and adolescents. Here, we report anti-TBE virus (TBEV) antibody persistence from 6 to 10 years post-booster administration.
   Methods: This was a phase IV, open-label, single-center, second extension study (NCT01562444), conducted in Czechia. Healthy adults and adolescents >= 12 years who had received 3 different primary vaccination schedules (rapid, conventional and accelerated conventional) in the parent study and a booster dose before (12-18 months post-primary series completion) or at the beginning (3 years post-primary series completion) of the first extension study were screened and enrolled in this study. Blood samples were collected yearly and anti-TBEV antibody response was evaluated by neutralizing test (NT) antibody assays. Analysis was performed overall and per age strata: 15-49 years, >= 50 years, and >= 60 years.
   Results: Of 206 screened individuals, 191 completed the study. Overall, 90-100% of participants in the all-screened set and >= 97% in the per-protocol set had the clinically meaningful threshold of protection (NT titers >= 10) across all timepoints, regardless of the primary vaccination schedule. Overall, antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) varied from 134 to 343 in the all-screened set. Older age groups showed overall lower GMTs, although GMTs remained higher than NT titers >= 10 up to year 10 in all groups.
   Conclusion: This study showed long-term persistence of anti-TBEV NT antibodies for up to 10 years after the first booster dose of TBEvac in all age groups, regardless of the primary vaccination schedule. (C) 2018 GSK. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The KISS1 gene product, kisspeptin, stimulates gonadotrophic steroid hormone (GNRH) neuronal signaling through the G-protein coupled receptor, kiss1r. Disturbance of this signaling pathway causes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in mammals. As part of this cutting-edge research project, we analyzed the efficacy of an oral kisspeptin recombinant vaccine on the reproductive physiology and behavior of ram lambs. Ten 56-day old ram lambs were randomly divided into treatment and control groups to receive the experimental recombinant vaccines, C500/pKS-asd or C500/pVAX-asd (aspartate-beta semialdehyde dehydrogenase), respectively. The vaccines were orally administered at day 0, 28 and 56 and blood samples were taken and scrotal circumference data recorded at 14-day intervals (days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, and 84). At the end of the experimental period, day 98, sexual behaviors were assessed, scrotal circumferences were measured, and blood samples were collected. Testicular samples were also collected after the animals were sacrificed. Anti-kisspeptin antibody and testosterone serum levels were measured by indirect ELISA. Results demonstrated that the levels of anti-kisspeptin antibodies were significantly higher in the treatment group compared to controls (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.001). However, serum testosterone levels were lower in the treatment group (P < 0.01). Interestingly, vaccine administration contributed to a significant reduction (P < 0.01) in sexual behavior propensity. These results suggest that the kisspeptin recombinant oral vaccine regulates and inhibits the reproductive physiology and behavior of ram lambs. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Moraxella catarrhalis (Mcat) is a frequent pathogen of acute otitis media (AOM) in young children. Here we prospectively assessed naturally-induced serum antibodies to four Mcat vaccine candidate proteins in stringently defined otitis prone (sOP) and non-otitis prone (NOP) children age 6-36 months old following nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization, at onset of AOM and convalescence from AOM.
   Methods: Serum IgG and IgM antibody against recombinant Mcat proteins, oligopeptide permease A (OppA), outer membrane protein (OMP) CD, hemagglutinin (Hag), and PilA Glade 2 (PilA2), were quantitated by ELISA.
   Results: During NP colonization by Mcat all four antigens were immunogenic in both sOP and NOP children. However, sOP children had lower antibody responses than NOP children across age 6-36 months, similar to our findings for protein vaccine candidates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) and Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). sOP children displayed a later and lower peak of antibody rise than NOP children for all four antigens during NP colonization of Mcat. The age-dependent increase of antibody ranked as OppA > Hag5-9 > OMP CD > PilA2 in both sOP and NOP children. Lower serum antibody levels to the Mcat antigens were measured in sOP compared to NOP children at the onset of AOM. We did not find a consistent significant increase of antibody at the convalescence phase after an AOM. event.
   Conclusions: sOP children is a highly vulnerable population that mount lower serum antibody responses to Mcat candidate vaccine proteins compared to NOP children during asymptomatic NP carriage and at onset of AOM. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this article, we describe the structure, functioning and work processes of Chile's NITAG (CAVEI) and assess its functionality, quality of work processes and outputs, and integration of the committee into the Ministry of Health policy process using the Assessment tool for National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups. Among its strengths, CAVEI's administrative and work plasticity allows it to respond in a timely manner to the Ministry of Health's requests and proactively raise subjects for review. Representation of multiple areas of expertise within the committee makes CAVEI a robust and balanced entity for the development of evidence-based comprehensive recommendations. High ranking profile of the Secretariat structure furthers CAVEI's competences in policymaking and serves as a bridge between the committee and international initiatives in the field of immunizations.

ID SPREAD
AB Edward Jenner's discovery of the smallpox vaccine spread rapidly across Europe. In Spain, vaccinations first took place in December 1800 and the practice flourished upon the private initiative of doctors, surgeons, state officials and members of the nobility in different parts of the country. Ignacio Maria Ruiz de Luzuriaga, secretary of the Royal Academy of Medicine of Madrid, is considered in medical historiography as a key figure of the introduction of the smallpox vaccine in Spain. Ruiz de Luzuriaga had a major role as a disseminator of the Jennerian technique and as a distributor of the vaccine fluid. Given his prestige as a doctor and his position in the Royal Academy, he was commissioned to establish a scientific and academic corpus on preventive measures to foster their understanding, uptake and good practice among Spanish vaccinators. He also attempted to create a Central Vaccine Committee, such as that existing in other European countries.

AB Anandamide (AEA), an endogenous cannabinoid, has a relevant antihypertensive effect. However, its cardioprotective role has been barely explored due to unfavorable physico-chemical properties and, sometimes, undesirable psychoactive effects. In this context, drug encapsulation in nanocarriers could overcome the limitations associated with the administration of AEA in free form. The aim of the present study was to encapsulate AEA in poly-epsilon-caprolactone/Pluronic (R) F127 nanoparticles (AEA/PCL/PF127 NPs) by means of electrospraying, to characterize their physico-chemical properties and cytocompatibility and to evaluate their effect in an in vivo model of cardiovascular remodeling caused by hypertension. AEA/PCL/PF127 NPs were characterized in terms of morphology, size, polydispersity, Z-potential, hydrophilicity, thermal and spectroscopic properties. Also, the encapsulation and loading efficiencies and in vitro release of AEA were analyzed. AEA/PCL/PF127 NPs (700-1000 nm) showed adequate cytocompatibility. For the cardiovascular remodeling studies, normotensive (WKY) and hypertensive (SHR) male rats were treated or not with AEA/PCL/PF127 NPs (5 mg/Kg, intraperitoneal injection) weekly for 1 month. Inflammatory markers and hemodynamic, structural and cardiac functional parameters were monitored. In SHR, the treatment with AEA/PCL/PF127 NPs reversed all altered cardiovascular markers and parameters (p < 0.05). Overall, nanoformulated AEA obtained by electrospraying proved to be effective for the treatment of hypertension and its comorbidities, especially cardiovascular remodeling.

AB Lipid nanocarriers incorporating glycerides, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-stearates and phospholipids have attracted great attention for in vivo diagnostic, in vivo imaging, activated or non-activated targeted drug delivery. For quality control purposes, the development of appropriate methods for the quantification of their lipid components is needed. In the present study, we developed an analytical method for lipid quantification in formulated nanoparticles. PEG-stearates and glycerides were analyzed in a single run by RP-UPLC-ELSD using a two-step gradient elution program, while the analysis of phospholipids was accomplished by HILIC-UPLC-ELSD after isolation using an SPE silica column. Using both isolated compounds and commercial lipid standards, calibration curves were produced using second-order polynomials to attain the quantitative evaluation of each lipid excipient. Relative standard deviation of all analytes was between 0.9% and 5.3% for intra-day precision and recovery ranged from 83.5% to 112.2%. The presented method was successfully implemented to study the manufacturing process and stability of the formulated lipid excipients during long-term storage and accelerated conditions. The formulation lipid yield was determined and found equal to 82.5%.

AB Mannitol and lactose are commonly used fillers in pharmaceutical tablets, available in several commercial grades that are produced using different manufacturing processes. These grades significantly differ in particulate and powder properties that impact tablet manufacturability. Choice of sub-optimum type or grade of excipient in tablet formulation can lead to manufacturing problems and difficulties, which are magnified during a continuous manufacturing process. Previous characterization of tableting performance of these materials was limited in scope and under conditions not always realistic to the commercial production of tablets. This work seeks to comprehensively characterize the compaction properties of 11 mannitol and 5 lactose grades using a compaction simulator at both slow and fast tableting speeds. These include tabletability, compressibility, tablet brittleness, die-wall stress transmission, and strain rate sensitivity. A chemometrical analysis of data, using the partial least square technique, was performed to construct a model to provide accurate prediction of tablet tensile strength for mannitol grades. Such knowledge facilitates the selection of suitable tablet filler to attain high quality tablet products.

AB Pulmonary delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) has shown promising results for the treatment of lung diseases with gene disorders. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of processing-induced thermal and shear stresses during the spray drying process on the solid-state properties, the chemical integrity and the bioactivity of spray-dried siRNA powder intended for inhalation. To this end, inhalable siRNA dry powders composed of EGFP-siRNA and mannitol were prepared by using a lab-scale spray drier. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), laser diffraction, and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) were used to characterize the solid-state properties of the spray-dried siRNA-mannitol powders. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and flow cytometry were exploited to assess the chemical stability and cellular transfection efficiency of siRNA formulations, respectively. The results showed that the spray-dried particles changed from spherical to irregular shape with an increase in the inlet temperature. The high inlet temperature and intensive atomization conditions resulted in more agglomerates in the spray-dried particles. XRPD analysis indicated that the presence of siRNA affected the polymorphic form of mannitol in the spray-dried powder. Compromised chemical stability and cell transfection efficiency of siRNA were observed with an increase in the thermal stress and shear stress during the spray drying process. The chemical stability of siRNA in liquid state was more prone to thermal stress when compared to the stability in the solid-state. In conclusion, stable siRNA based particles for inhalation purposes could be produced using the spray drying technology.

AB Photothermal therapy had great potential in being a new approach of tumour ablation due to their high selectivity and low side effect. However, the shallow penetration depth of near-infrared (NIR) irradiation resulted in the limited curative effect. Herein, a novel nanomedicine was developed based on the indocyanine green-loaded vanadium oxide nanocomposites (VO2-ICG) for pH-activated NIR luminescence imaging-guided enhanced photothermal tumour ablation. In acidic tumour microenvironment, the VO2 NPs were decomposed and released VO2+, which could not only inhibit the function of 60 kDa heat shock protein (HSP60), but also generate hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) by catalysing intratumoral H2O2. Furthermore, the ICG was also released in the decomposition process of VO2 NPs, allowing the pH-activated NIR luminescence imaging and photothermal therapy. The inhibition of HSP60 down-regulated the heat tolerance of cells and the generation of (OH)-O-center dot upregulated the intracellular oxidative stress, which enhanced the photothermal therapeutic efficiency. Our work demonstrated a promised method to enhance photothermal therapeutic effect, highlighting the importance of HSP inhibition and (OH)-O-center dot generation in promoting cell apoptosis under mild hyperthermia.

AB Intranasal drug delivery provided an alternative and effective approach for the intervention of an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, the short retention time at the absorption site and slow drug transport in intranasal gel influence the drug bioavailability and outcome of ICH. Herein, we fabricated a novel intranasal gel with oriented drug migration utilizing a charge-driven strategy to attenuate brain injury after ICH. Nicardipine hydrochloride (NCD) was entrapped in chitosan nanoparticles (CS NPs) and dispersed in an HAMC gel. Subsequently, one side of the gel was coated with a positively charged film. The oriented migration of CS NPs in the HAMC gel was determined, and the drug bioavailability was also enhanced. Furthermore, a blood-induced ICH rat model was established to evaluate the therapeutic effect of CS NPs + HAMC composites. Intranasal administration of the CS NPs + HAMC ( +) composite showed a stronger neuroprotective effect in terms of brain edema reduction and neural apoptosis inhibition compared to the CS NPs + HAMC composite. These results suggested that the oriented and rapid drug transport from nose to brain can be achieved using the charge-driven strategy, and this intranasal drug delivery system has the potential to provide a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ICH.

AB Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is increasingly being used for studies of pharmaceutical film coating. OCT allows fast and non-destructive analysis of the coating thickness and quality via high-resolution cross-sectional images. Information about both the coating thickness and the coating quality can be extracted. Most studies and OCT applications performed to date have been limited to off-line measurements and off-line computations of coating features based on data acquired in-line. This study examines OCT's applicability to an industrial-scale pan coating process. Automated layer detection, classification and thickness calculation were executed in real time. To evaluate the system's performance, runs with various tablet size, coating solution concentration and operating parameters were carried out and monitored. Our results indicate that, in addition to correct end-point determination, OCT enables real-time monitoring of the coating processes (thickness, homogeneity and roughness) and can support active process control by supplying information about the coating thickness and quality.

AB The purpose of this investigation was to improve the solubility and oral bioavailability of daidzein via preparing nanosuspensions (NS) with steric stabilizers, electrostatic stabilizers, or a combination of both. Based on particle size and zeta potential, daidzein NS stabilized by HP-beta-CD, soy lecithin, HP-beta-CD + soy lecithin, TPGS, TPGS + SBE-beta-CD, SDS, or HPMC E5 + SDS were generated and characterized by scanning electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy. In addition, the stability, cytotoxicity, solubility, dissolution, and pharmacokinetics of NS were evaluated. The resulting daidzein NS were physically stable and biocompatible and presented as regular shapes with homogenous particle sizes of 360-600 nm and decreased crystallinity. Due to the increased solubility and dissolution rate, the oral bioavailability of daidzein NS in rats was 1.63-2.19 times greater than that of crude daidzein. In particular, among the investigated seven daidzein NS formulations, daidzein NS prepared with the costabilizers HPMC E5 + SDS is an optimal formulation for increased daidzein bioavailability. The present study proposes that the combined usage of steric and electrostatic stabilizers is a promising strategy for improving the bioavailability of water-insoluble flavonoid compounds by an NS approach.

   FORMULATION
AB Amorphous solid dispersions are nowadays typically made up of a drug compound and a water-soluble polymer. However, recently it has been demonstrated that amorphous solid dispersions based on insoluble polymers have a different and more delayed drug release profile, resulting in a prolonged duration of supersaturation. In this paper, binary and ternary amorphous solid dispersions based on poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) were prepared through spray drying to further investigate the potential of this type of carrier. As drug release from this matrix system was expected to be dictated by a diffusion-driven process, porosity of the formulation was adjusted by the inclusion of a water-soluble polymer. The solid state of the formulations was characterized with modulated differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray powder diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. The release of drug and of the porosity increasing agent was measured in acidic and neutral conditions. In addition, the release performance of the spray dried product was compared with the drug release from poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) beads, which had already been reported in literature. It appeared that in the case of the spray dried poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), drug and porosity increasing agent could only be released to a certain extent due to entrapment of both compounds in the poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) network. While the chemical crosslinks of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) beads ensured a more rigid structure with sufficient free space for drug diffusion, the spray dried product was susceptible to intense physical crosslinking upon contact with the dissolution medium.

AB Self-(micro)emulsifying drug delivery systems (S(M)EDDS) have emerged as effective vehicles for enhancing bioavailability of poorly water soluble drugs, however solidification of the systems represents a major challenge. Objective of this study was development of carvedilol loaded liquid SMEDDS and transformation into solid pellets employing fluid-bed coating technologies. Carvedilol-loaded formulation of SMEDDS was comprised of Capmul (R) MCM EP, castor oil, Kolliphor (R) RH40 and PEG 400. The obtained liquid SMEDDS mixed with fillers and polymers was layered onto MCC pellets. Coating process was conducted in the modified, swirl-flow based fluid bed coating device, which was proved superior over the conventional Wurster fluid bed, with lower agglomeration rate. Use of polymer was essential for entrapping SMEDDS in the coating layer(s). Self-microemulsifying properties as well as fast drug release as one of main SMEDDS advantages were preserved in the solid products. Addition of lactose into the coating dispersion and applying intermediate and surface film coating to the pellets enabled higher drug loading and prevented sticking of the pellets during handling and storage. Present study indicates that the (swirling) fluid-bed pellet coating technology is a promising strategy for preparation of solid SMEDDS-coated pellets with adequate drug loading capacity and enhanced release of poorly water soluble drug.

AB Chitosan (CS) is a biodegradable and biocompatible polysaccharide which displays immune-stimulatory effects and anti-bacterial properties to facilitate wound closure. Over the years, different CS-based dressings have been developed; however, most of them are not fully biodegradable due to the involvement of synthetic polymers during dressing fabrication. In addition, preparation of many of these dressings is laborious, and may impose damaging effects on fragile therapeutic molecules. The objective of this study is to address these problems by developing a tunable, biocompatible, and biodegradable CS-based dressing for wound treatment. The dressing is fabricated via electrostatic interactions between CS and carmellose (CM). Its swelling properties, erosion behavior, loading efficiency and drug release sustainability can be tuned by simply changing the CS/CM mass-tomass ratio. Upon loaded with minocycline hydrochloride, the dressing effectively protects the wound in mice from infection and enhances wound closure. Regarding its high tunability and promising in vivo performance, our dressing warrants further development as a user-friendly dressing for use in wound care.

AB Thin and erodible polymeric films were developed as potential ocular drug delivery systems to increase drug retention on the eye with the aim of improving bioavailability and achieving controlled drug release. Two biocompatible film forming polymers, hyaluronic acid (HA) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), which are currently used as thickening agents in eye drops were employed. Two different films were prepared (i) as single polymer and (ii) as composite formulations by solvent casting method, incorporating glycerol (GLY) as plasticizer and timolol maleate (TM) as model glaucoma drug. After preliminary optimization of transparency and ease of handling, the formulations were further characterized for their physicochemical properties. No indication of significant drug-polymer or polymer-polymer (in composite films) interaction was observed from FTIR results while evaluation by IR mapping revealed uniform distribution of drug throughout the films. Amorphization of TM in the film matrix was confirmed by both DSC and XRD. Swelling studies illustrated remarkable swelling capacity of HA in comparison with HPMC which directly affected the drug release profiles, making HA a suitable polymer for controlled ocular drug delivery. Tensile and mucoadhesion properties confirmed higher elasticity and adhesiveness of HA while HPMC produced stronger films. The effect of sterilization by UV radiation on mechanical properties was also evaluated and showed no significant difference between the sterilized and non-sterilized films. The SEM results confirmed smoothness and homogeneity of film surfaces for all the formulations studied. The in vitro drug dissolution studies showed more extended release profiles of formulations containing HA. Cytotoxicity study (cell viability) using MTT assay on HeLa cells, confirmed that the single polymer and composite films are generally safe for ocular administration. The present work shows excellent film forming ability of HA and HPMC which can be used as single polymer or combined in composite formulations as potential topical ocular drug delivery platform to enhance drug retention on the ocular surface and therefore potential improved bioavailability.

AB Topical drug delivery in the oral mucosa has its set of challenges due to the unique anatomical and physiological features of the oral cavity. As such, the outcomes of local pharmacological treatments in oral disorders can fail due to unsuccessfully drug delivery. Oral mucositis, a severe inflammatory and ulcerative side effect of oncological treatments, is one of such diseases. Although the damaged tissue is within reach, no approved topical drug treatment is available. Several strategies based on its physiopathology have been implemented and clinically used. Even so, results tend to lack or be insufficient to improve patient's quality of life. The use of corticosteroids has been employed in such strategies due to their strong anti-inflammatory action. Typically, these are administrated in simple liquid formulations, where the drug is dispersed or solubilized, lacking the ability to maintain local concentration. In this work, we propose the development of a biocompatible delivery system with boosted abilities of retention and control release of budesonide, a corticosteroid with an elevated ratio of topical anti-inflammatory to systemic action. Through spray-drying, polymeric particles of Chitosan and Eudragit (R) E PO were produced and characterized for the vectorization of this drug.

The new amphiphiles presenting a peptidic motif on a short hydrophilic spacer group were evaluated for selective gene silencing through RNA interference. Our results show that tryptophan residues boost siRNA delivery in an unexpected manner. The silencing experiments performed with very low concentrations of siRNA showed that the best formulations could induce significant death of tumor cells after silencing of polo-like kinase 1 which is implicated in cell cycle progression. In addition, these Trp containing peptide amphiphiles were highly efficient siRNA delivery vectors even in presence of competing serum proteins.

AB Lung cancer remains 23% of cancer-related death worldwide, ranking on first place for men and second place for women. Almost each cancer type has a great deal in common, overexpression of the apoptosis inhibitor survivin. Chemotherapy with anticancer drugs is leading to side effects. Drug targeting by the use of nanobubbles is a useful strategy to reduce side effects. Nanobubbles in cancer are one of the most investigated carriers in the last years. The size of nanobubbles (1-500 nm) is bigger than the pore size of healthy tissues, but smaller than the pores of cancer tissues. Thus, it is not possible for the drug to leave the blood stream and enter the tissue, but it can enter the cancer tissue through the pores, where it can accumulate. Therefore, the probability of undesired side effects decreases. For that reason, the development of nanobubbles containing paclitaxel and survivin inhibitor sepantronium bromide (YM155) were carried out. Characterization studies in terms of particle size, size distribution, zeta potential and morphology, and investigation of their effects on lung cancer cells were performed. To the best of our knowledge, there is no information in the literature about combining paclitaxel and YM155 loaded nanobubbles with ultrasound exposure.

AB Purpose: In the present work, a comparison between MDI and DPI for evaluating performance of the devices were carried out by experimentally investigating the deposition parameters through a realistic airway replica.
   Methods: Computed tomography (CT) images of the respiratory airway of a healthy subject were used to develop the realistic model. The airway replica was included extrathoracic, trachea, and tracheobronchial tree up to fourth generations which was fabricated by rapid prototyping. Afterward, in vitro experiments were performed to validate the airway model by comparing the total deposition (G0 to G3) of present replica with available data in the literature. Drug deposition (Salbutamol) in the model was measured by determining concentration of the segments sample by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) assay.
   Results: Deposition parameters were used for investigating the deposition patterns of the inhaled particles. Results showed that inertial impaction is the dominant mechanism in the most regions of the replica. It was found that the MDI delivered more drug to the tracheobronchial tree compared to the DPI for three different flow rate.
   Conclusion: The developed realistic respiratory airways model provided an opportunity to more accurately evaluate the performance of drug delivery devices and studying mechanisms of the drug deposition.

AB The purpose of this work was to compare the particle characteristics and dissolution performance of amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) of ketoprofen and vinyl-pyrrolidone based polymers prepared using electrospraying and spray drying methods. Solution characteristics (surface tension, viscosity and conductivity) were determined for ethanolic solutions containing different vinyl-pyrrolidone based polymers (PVP and PVPVA) and different ketoprofen to polymer mass ratios. The only statistically significant difference in solution properties between PVP and PVPVA systems was electrical conductivity. The higher conductivity in PVP-containing solutions resulted in smaller, more spherical particles than the equivalent formulations prepared with PVPVA when processed via electrospraying. Electrospraying resulted in powders with higher specific surface area, smaller mean particle size, and narrower particle size distribution relative to the spray-dried material. Amorphisation of ketoprofen via both processes was confirmed using pXRD, DSC and FTIR. Although the specific surface area of the electrosprayed powder was higher than the equivalent spray-dried system, this did not translate into a faster dissolution rate at pH 1.2 but did lead to a faster surface moisture adsorption rate at various relative humidities. The flowability of the powder produced via the electrospraying process is poor compared to the equivalent powder produced via spray drying, which may cause challenges in downstream processing. While the ASD powder produced via electrospraying had a smaller particle size and narrower size distribution compared to equivalent spray-dried ASD, further refinement in terms of a final formulation is needed to translate this benefit into an improved dissolution rate in the case of ketoprofen.

AB The occurrence of lung cancer is linked with tobacco smoking, mainly through the generation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Elevated activity of cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) plays an important role in the metabolic processing of PAHs and its carcinogenicity. The present work aimed to investigate the role of CYP1A1 gene in PAH-mediated growth and tumor development in vitro and using an in vivo animal model. RNAi strategy was utilized to inhibit the overexpression of CYP1A1 gene using cationic liposomes generated using a lipid film-coated proliposome microparticles. Treatment of PAH-induced human alveolar adenocarcinoma cell line with cationic liposomes carrying CYP1A1 siRNA resulted in down regulation of CYP1A1 mRNA, protein as well as its enzymatic activity, triggering apoptosis and inhibiting multicellular tumor spheroids formation in vitro. Furthermore, silencing of CYP1A1 gene in BALB/c nude xenografts inhibited tumor growth via down regulation of CYP1A1 expression. Altogether, our findings showed that liposome-based gene delivery technology is a viable and stable approach for targeting cancer causing genes such as CY1PA1. This technology facilitated by the use of sugar particles coated with lipid films has demonstrated ability to generate anticancer effects that might be used in the future for therapeutic intervention and treatment of lung cancer.

AB In the present study, a model was developed to estimate tablet tensile strength utilizing the gravitation-based high-velocity (G-HVC) method introduced earlier. Three different formulations consisting of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCP), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), theophylline and magnesium stearate were prepared. The formulations were granulated using fluid bed granulation and the granules were compacted with the G-HVC method and an eccentric tableting machine. Compaction energy values defined from G-HVC data predicted tensile strength of the tablets surprisingly well. It was also shown, that fluid bed granulation improved the compaction energy intake of the granules in comparison to respective physical mixtures. In addition, general mechanical properties and elastic recovery were also examined for all samples. In this study it was finally concluded, that the data obtained by the method was of practical relevance in pharmaceutical formulation development.

AB The present investigation was performed to develop a rifampicin (RIF)-loaded solidified self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) (solidified RIF-OF1) for in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Optimized formulations were tested for their powder flow characteristics, loading efficiency, and in vitro dissolution (at pH-1.2, 6.8 and 7.4). Compatibility studies were also performed. The formulations were also tested for hemocompatibility, intestinal permeation, histopathological effects, and in vivo pharmacokinetics. Additionally, an in silico simulation study using GastroPlus was performed. At different varied pH values, we observed immediate release (T-85% within 15 min) based on the dissolution profile. This could be due to labrasol-assisted RIF solubilization. In vitro hemolysis study of the reconstituted RIF-OF1 revealed normal architecture of erythrocytes compared to the positive control (lysed and fragmented). Through in vivo permeation and biopsy studies, a rationale for facilitated intestinal permeation of RIF with components deemed physiological safe (normal anatomy of mucosal membrane evidenced from biopsy study) could be established. The in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) plus module of GastroPlus (TM) simulation showed a good IVIVC between in vitro release and in vivo absorption with a predicted systemic absorption of similar to 96.5%. Solidified SNEDDS showed improved pharmacokinetic profiles compared to RIF suspension. Solid RIF-SNEDDS was demonstrated to be a suitable carrier for enhanced intestinal permeation and oral bioavailability. Hence, it may serve as a suitable alternative to conventional delivery systems for tuberculosis treatment.

AB Glioblastoma stem cells correspond to brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs) that have been identified in glioblastoma, the most common and aggressive brain tumor, as responsible for tumor initiation, progression and recurrence due to their resistance to current treatments. Targeting these cancer stem cells represents a crucial challenge to develop new therapeutic strategies. Previous works have shown that the NFL-TBS. 40-63 peptide, corresponding to a tubulin-binding site on neurofilaments, targets and reduces in vitro and in vivo the viability of glioblastoma cells without affecting healthy cells. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of this peptide on BTICs isolated from human glioblastoma.
   The uptake of this peptide alone or coupled to nanocapsules was analyzed by flow cytometry and immunochemistry. Its anti-tumor effect was studied using proliferation, adhesion and viability assays. Peptide-mediated effects were also evaluated on the BTIC self-renewal ability and by immunocytochemistry to investigate their cell shape and microtubule network.
   Here we show that the peptide enters massively in BTICs and demonstrates an anti-tumor effect by inhibiting their proliferation and inducing their death through an alteration of their microtubule network and cell-cell adhesion, and a decrease in the self-renewal ability of these cancer stem cells.
   These results indicate that the NFL-TBS. 40-63 peptide represents a promising therapeutic drug for glioblastoma treatment by targeting and killing both glioblastoma cells and BTICs to prevent recurrence.

AB Sorafenib, a potent anticancer drug, has low absorption in the gastrointestinal tract due to its poor aqueous solubility. The main purpose of this investigation was to design sorafenib nanoparticle using a newly developed technique, nanoparticulation using fat and supercritical fluid (NUFS (TM)) to improve the absorption of sorafenib. The quality by design (QbD) tool was adopted to define the optimal formulation variables: hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), polyvinyl pyrrolidone K30 (PVP), and poloxamer. The studied response variables were particle size of nanoparticle, dissolution (5, 60, and 180 min), drug concentration time profile of nanoparticle formulations, and maximum drug concentration. The result of particle size revealed that an increase in concentration of poloxamer and HPMC decreased the particle size of nanoparticles (p < 0.05). Likewise, the concentration of drug release at different time point (5, 60, and 180 min) showed HPMC and poloxamer had positive effects on drug dissolution while PVP had negative effects on it. The design space was built in accordance with the particle size of nanoparticle (target < 500 nm) and dissolution of sorafenib (target > 7 mu m/mL), following failure probability analysis using Monte Carlo simulations. In vivo pharmacokinetics studies in beagle dogs demonstrated that optimized formulation of sorafenib (F3 and F4 tablets) exhibited higher blood drug profiles indicating better absorption compared to the reference tablet (Nexavar (R)). In conclusion, this study showed the importance of systematic formulation design for understanding the effect of formulation variables on the characteristics of nanoparticles of the poorly soluble drug.

AB The purpose of this work was to develop a robust hot-melt extrusion and strand pelletization process for manufacturing pellets with an immediate release (IR) of a poorly water-soluble active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), nimodipine. The robustness of pharmaceutical continuous manufacturing processes and of its control strategy is vital for competitiveness to traditional batch-manufacturing. Therefore, first the sensitivity of product quality, process stability, and process monitoring tools to i) parameter changes due to control actions and ii) typical process deviations, i.e., feeding errors, was investigated in a design of experiments (DoE). Thereby, die melt pressure was found to be highly sensitive to composition deviations, i.e. a limiting factor for process stability. Especially critical were deviations to increased HPMC content, since it behaved as a filler in the melt. Pelletization, or pellet size and size distribution respectively, were found to be sensitive to an increased throughput, due to the resulting insufficient strand cooling before the pelletizer. API dissolution in contrast, was found to be robust across the entire investigated range of formulation and process settings. Second, a design space for the production of IR pellets for subsequent tableting was established, and finally, a technical control strategy was developed to ensure a robust process. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy was applied to monitor API content and the sensitivity of the residence time distribution (RTD) was investigated by means of tracer measurements. NIR-based API content monitoring and RTD models for material tracking were found to be at risk after processing melt with high HPMC content, due to a lack of purging by less viscous formulation compositions.

AB Commonly, a limited number of generally accepted bulking agents and lyoprotectants are used for freeze-drying; predominantly mannitol, glycine, sucrose and trehalose. The purpose of this study was to combine a theoretical approach using molecular descriptors with a large scale experimental screening to evaluate the suitability of a broad range of excipients for freeze-drying. A large selection of sugars, polyols and amino acids was characterized by modulated differential scanning calorimetry (mDSC) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) after well-plate based freeze-drying. The calculated molecular descriptors were investigated with both hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis. A clear clustering of the excipients according to the size-related and weight-related descriptors was observed; however other relevant descriptors could also be identified. From a practical perspective, a trend was observed with regard to a higher likelihood for amorphisation and a higher glass transition temperature of the maximally freeze-concentrated solution with increasing molecular size. A translation of the molecular descriptors on pharmaceutical performance was more successful for lyoprotectants than for bulking agents. Additionally, in the course of the experimental screening, several new potential bulking agents and lyoprotectants were identified.

AB The recent impact of the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) and the Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification System (BDDCS) on relevant scientific advancements is discussed. The major advances associated with the BCS concern the extensive work on dissolution of poorly absorbed BCS class II drugs in nutritional liquids (e.g. milk, peanut oil) and biorelevant media for the accurate prediction of the rate and the extent of oral absorption. The use of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling as predictive tool for bioavailability is also presented. Since recent dissolution studies demonstrate that the two mechanisms (diffusion- and reaction-limited dissolution) take place simultaneously, the neglected reaction-limited dissolution models are discussed, regarding the biopharmaceutical classification of drugs. Solubility- and dissolution-enhancing formulation strategies based on the supersaturation principle to enhance the extent of drug absorption, along with the applications of the BDDCS to the understanding of disposition phenomena are reviewed. Finally, recent classification systems relevant either to the BCS or the BDDCS are presented. These include: i) a model independent approach based on %metabolism and the fulfilment (or not) of the current regulatory dissolution criteria, ii) the so called AB Gamma system, a continuous version of the BCS, and iii) the so-called Extended Clearance Classification System (ECCS). ECCS uses clearance concepts (physicochemical properties and membrane permeability) to classify compounds and differentiates from BDDCS by bypassing the measure of solubility (based on the assumption that since it inter-correlates with lipophilicity, it is not directly relevant to clearance mechanisms or elimination).

AB Polyoxyethanyl-alpha-tocopheryl sebacate (PTS) is an amphiphilic compound with self-emulsifying properties known to form micelles. In this work, we report the production of PTS micelles for the encapsulation and delivery of a hydrophobic derivative of methotrexate, MTX di-ethylated (MTX-OEt). We optimized the micelles production by testing two different techniques: auxiliary solvent and sonication. Small and homogeneous micelles ( approximate to 40 nm) were obtained through the auxiliary solvent method performed at 30 degrees C and using 15 mg/mL of PTS. The produced micelles with the most promising physicochemical properties did not induce cytotoxicity when tested in normal human cells (BJ5ta cells), being considered for the encapsulation of MTX-OEt. This prodrug was achieved by Fisher esterification using ethanol, being isolated in good yield (eta = 68%). MTX-OEt was efficiently encapsulated onto the produced micelles which preserved their physicochemical properties. The PTS micelles loaded with MTX-OEt, free MTX-OEt and free unmodified MTX revealed similar biological effect against cancer cells (Caco-2 cells). These results demonstrated that the biological activity of MTX is not altered after modification. The developed PTS micelles revealed a promising intracellular delivery performance with potentiality for cancer therapy.

AB In this study, the possibility of producing highly antibody-loaded microparticles with sustained-release properties was evaluated. Polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) was used as a model of antibody and its encapsulation into poly(lactide-co-glycolide) acid (PLGA) microparticles was performed by spray-drying a water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion. It was demonstrated that the use of the Resomer (R) RG505 PLGA allowed an IgG loading of 20% w/w with an encapsulation efficiency higher than 85%. The produced microparticles were characterized by a mean diameter lower than 10 mu m. The burst effect was shown to reach a maximal value of 40%. IgG stability after encapsulation was also assessed. The use of this single PLGA provided a lag time of 3 months which dramatically slowed down the release rate after the initial release of the encapsulated IgG. Using blends of PLGA characterized by different inherent viscosities allowed decreasing the lag time and modulating the dissolution profile of the IgG from the spray-dried microparticles. Therefore, spray-drying a water-in-oil emulsion appeared to be a promising strategy to produce highly antibody-loaded microparticles characterized by sustained-release properties.

AB Vitamin B12 plays an essential role in one-carbon metabolism in the human body. A deficiency in this vitamin can lead to severe haematopoietic and neuropsychiatric disorders and is currently treated by oral or parenteral administration of exogenous vitamin. Unfortunately, the absorption of orally taken vitamin B12 is low and highly variable, while injections can cause pain and anxiety. Thus, an efficient alternative drug delivery system for overcoming these shortcomings is highly desirable. Novel polymeric microneedle (MN) arrays have the potential for minimally invasive transdermal treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency. Bilayer dissolving MN arrays (19 x 19 needles, 600 mu m height) containing 135 mu g vitamin B12 were cast using two different aqueous polymer blends. MN arrays showed sufficient mechanical strength for skin insertion, dissolved rapidly and delivered 72.92% of their drug load in vitro over 5 h. Ultimately, the potential of delivering a therapeutically relevant dose of vitamin B12 transdermally was demonstrated in vivo in Sprague-Dawley rats by comparison to subcutaneous injections. Maximum plasma levels of 0.37 mu g/mL occurred 30 min post-MN application, highlighting the ability of fabricated MN arrays to rapidly deliver vitamin B12 transdermally.

AB Electrospun nanofibers are known as the advanced means for wound dressing. They have represented remarkable potency to encapsulate and deliver biomolecules promoting the wound healing process. Compared to synthetic polymers, naturally derived polymers (NDP) are more qualified candidates for fabrication of biomedical electrospun scaffolds. Not only nanofibers of NDP illustrate higher biocompatibility and biodegradability rates, but also they mimic the native extracellular matrix more closely, which leads to the wound closure acceleration by enhancing tissue regeneration. Aside, incorporation of bioactive molecules and therapeutic agents into the nanofibers can generate innovative bioactive wound dressings with significantly improved healing potentials. This paper starts with a brief discussion on the steps and factors influencing the wound healing process. Then, the recent applications of electrospun nanofibers as wound dressing with healing accelerating properties are reviewed. Further, the various healing agents and alternative strategies for modification and functionalization of bioactive naturally-derived electrospun nanofibers are discussed.

AB Staphylococcal biofilms cause many infectious diseases and are highly tolerant to the effects of antimicrobials; this is partly due to the biofilm matrix, which acts as a physical barrier retarding the penetration and reducing susceptibility to antimicrobials, thereby decreasing successful treatment outcomes. In this study, both single and mixed micellar systems based on poly vinyl caprolactam (PCL)-polyethylene glycol (PEG) copolymers were optimised for delivery of chlorhexidine (CHX) to S. aureus, MRSA and S. epidermidis biofilms and evaluated for their toxicity using Caenorhabditis elegans. The respective polyethylene glycol (PEG) and poly vinyl caprolactam (PCL) structural components promoted stealth properties and enzymatic responsive release of CHX inside biofilms, leading to significantly enhanced penetration (56%) compared with free CHX and improving the efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus biofilms grown on an artificial dermis (2.4 log reduction of CFU). Mixing Soluplus-based micelles with Solutol further enhanced the CHX penetration (71%) and promoted maximum reduction in biofilm biomass ( > 60%). Nematodes-based toxicity assay showed micelles with no lethal effects as indicated by their high survival rate (100%) after 72 h exposure. This study thus demonstrated that bio-responsive carriers can be designed to deliver a poorly water-soluble antimicrobial agent and advance the control of biofilm associated infections.

AB In situ keratin hydrogel offer a promising strategy to relieve the brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) by delivering the iron chelator directly to the stroke site. However, the injectable property of traditional keratin hydrogel is unsatisfactory, which can't provide adaptable filling of lesion defects with irregular shapes. Herein, the thermo sensitive keratin-g-PNIPAM polymers with different graft ratios were synthesized, and deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) loaded thermo sensitive keratin hydrogels (TKGs) were prepared using the oxidative crosslinking method. The lower critical solution temperature of TKGs can be tailored from 28.5 to 31.8 degrees C by varying the graft ratios of keratin to NIPAM, and TKG can fill up the complex shapes of lesion cavities easily due to the characteristic of sol-gel transition. In addition, TKGs exhibit stronger adsorption and clearance capacities for the Fe2+ than keratin gel. Meanwhile, in situ injection of TKG with different DFO loadings (0.1, 1.0, and 10 mg/mL) into the hematoma region after ICH surgery showed a stronger effect on the reduction of ICH-induced iron deposits, brain non-heme iron content, brain edema and ROS level compared to the DFO treatment by intraperitoneal administration. Thus, the developed TKG can be potentially exploited for iron-induced brain injury after ICH.

AB Two-dimensional population balance model (PBM) is developed in order to model pharmaceutical granules formation in a twin-screw wet granulator. Granule size and liquid content are considered as internal coordinates, while axial length of granulator is considered as external coordinate. Two types of initial liquid distribution are considered for the model development, i.e. constant and linear distributions. The main focus is on modeling and validation of liquid content distribution of granules. Regime-separated approach was used in order to capture the non-homogeneity of the granulator. The plug flow regime is considered for the conveying zone, while well-mixed regime is assumed for the kneading zone of twin-screw granulator. Aggregation and breakage are considered as the main mechanisms for granule formation and size control. Cell average method is used for solution of the PBM based on lumped parameter approach. In order to determine experimentally the distribution of liquid, liquid binder by dye addition was used in the process. The model findings are calibrated and validated by comparing with measured liquid content in each size fraction. The measured data is collected on a 12 mm twin-screw wet granulator using microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and water soluble dye plus water as binder. The model indicated to be valid for MCC and needs to be validated with further excipients. The results revealed that increasing screw speed led to more uniform liquid distribution. Finally, the model findings indicated that 2D PBM is capable of predicting liquid distribution, and can be used as predictive tool in pharmaceutical continuous granulation.

AB In this paper, two novel polymorphs of adefovir dipivoxil-saccharin (AD-SAC) cocrystals, forms II and III, were prepared and characterized by PXRD, DSC, FT-IR and SEM. Polymorphic transformations of these two forms and the known form (form I) were also investigated. In comparison to form I, forms II and III of AD-SAC cocrystals showed different thermal behaviors on DSC, characteristic diffraction peaks on PXRD and absorption spectra on FT-IR. In addition, form I exhibited an irregular plate-like shape, while forms II and III showed as needle-like shape and stubby columnar shape, respectively. During the heating process on DSC, forms I and II underwent solid-solid transformations to form III with endothermic transition peaks, suggesting that forms I and II were enantiotropically related to form III. Furthermore, slurry conversion experiments in ethanol showed forms II and III would quickly convert to form I by solution-mediated transformation, indicating that form I was the most stable form among three forms of AD-SAC cocrystal from 15 to 50 degrees C.

AB The current research aimed to explore medium chain triglycerides (MCT) incorporation in liposomes to overcome stability challenges when drugs with high molecular weight and payload are loaded within lipid membranes. A model drug clarithromycin was loaded in lipid dispersions with various MCT/phospholipids ratios (R-M/P = 0, 0.5, 1.75 and 7.5 w/w). TEM images demonstrated a liposome-to-emulsion structural transformation by MCT incorporation to cause increased particle size (104.3-167.7 nm) but decreased zeta potential (- 63.6 to - 44.4 mV) of lipid particles. MCT incorporation produced biphasic release in PBS and accelerated released in plasma. The tolerance of liposomes for thermal sterilization, high temperature test and freeze-thaw cycles were significantly improved by MCT incorporation. However, MCT incorporation produced adverse effects on colloidal stability in plasma and pharmacokinetics behavior in vivo to some extent. MCT stabilizing mechanism attributes to the modulation of drug loading area and stability improvement of lipid carriers. MCT incorporated liposomes achieved 2-3 fold cellular uptake level than traditional liposomes without significant cytotoxicity. These results indicated that MCT incorporation could be a promising strategy to apply in liposome production to achieve stable drug loading.

AB As constituents of cellular membranes, lecithins feature high biocompatibility and great emulsifying properties due to their amphiphilicity. Additionally, there are expectations that these naturally occurring emulsifying agents can replace other skin damaging emulsifiers like sodium dodecyl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate. However, cytotoxicity data of lecithin-based formulations on primary human skin cells are scarce. Thus, we developed nanoemulsions with different kinds of surfactants (amphoteric, anionic and non-ionic), studied the skin permeation of a model drug from this formulations employing Franz-type diffusion cells and monitored their cytotoxicity potential on primary human keratinocytes and fibroblasts using a cell proliferation assay. The skin diffusion studies demonstrated that the amphoteric lecithin-based emulsifiers were superior to non-ionic surfactants in terms of skin permeation, but inferior to anionic emulsifiers. Further, we found that the nanoemulsions containing the amphoteric lecithins as emulsifying agents lead to significantly higher viability rates of both epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts than the investigated anionic and non-ionic surfactants. This renders them a promising alternative to conventional emulsifiers used in daily products.

AB Chronic pain represents one of the most important public health problems, with a great prevalence of comorbidity with depression and cognitive decline. Antidepressants such as duloxetine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, represent an essential part of the therapeutic strategy for chronic pain management in addition to classical analgesics. Duloxetine is endowed with good efficacy and a good profile of safety and tolerability. Yet, duloxetine is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system 2D6 and 1A2 (CYP2D6 and CYP1A2) and it exhibits moderate inhibitory activity on CYP2D6, resulting in side effects and metabolic interactions that may occur on a long term therapeutic schedule.
   Cyclodextrins (CyDs) are used in pharmaceutical applications for numerous purposes, including the improvement of drug bioavailability. In order to evaluate their effects on the activity of duloxetine, we first spectrophotometrically studied the host-guest complexes obtained combining duloxetine and different beta-CyD derivatives (beta-CyD, beta-CyDen-c-(Glu-Glu), and succinyl-beta-CyD) and then performed in vivo and in vitro studies. Among duloxetine/CyDs complexes, succinyl-beta-CyD ameliorated the analgesic activity of duloxetine in the tail flick test and in the formalin test in mice and significantly protected the drug from CYP2D6 metabolism.

AB Live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis), marketed as Bacille Calmette-Guerin is the only FDA-approved vaccine against tuberculosis. The prerequisite of cold chain storage between 2 and 8 degrees C hinders the global vaccination effort. The study aims to investigate the effect of trehalose, sucrose and glycerol combinations in enhancing the stability of M. bovis. The bacilli were formulated in various ratios of trehalose-glycerol, sucrose-glycerol, trehalose-sucrose-glycerol systems (test samples) and sodium glutamate (control), freeze-dried and stored for 28 days at 4 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C. Bacteria viability at pre-, post-freeze-drying and after storage were quantified by its density in colony-forming unit per milliliter (CFU/mL) as obtained through the pour plate method. Formulations were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry. Structural collapsed cakes were found on all freeze-dried formulations because of the low T-g'. Comparing between binary and ternary formulations, trehalose-sucrose-glycerol was found to be a superior lyoprotectant. Upon storage, the viability of bacteria in disaccharide-polyol formulations was highest when stored at 4 degrees C followed by 25 degrees C. The lowest viability was found after storage at 37 degrees C. While the ternary disaccharide-polyol system may be used as a thermoprotectant up to 25 degrees C, sodium glutamate has a superior thermoprotective effect at temperature above 25 degrees C.

AB Recently, it has become evident that pharmaceutical excipients may interfere with the activity of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and solute carriers (SLC). The present review aims to provide an overview of surfactants shown to modulate substrate transport via SLCs and ABCs, and to discuss the relevance for oral drug absorption. In vitro, more than hundred surfactants have been suggested to decrease the efflux activity of P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1), and many of these surfactants also inhibit the breast cancer resistance protein (BCPR, ABCG2), while conflicting results have been reported for multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2, ABCC2). In animals, surfactants such as pluronic (R) P85 and polysorbate 20 have been shown to enhance the oral absorption of P-gp and BCRP substrates. Many surfactants, including cremophor (R) EL and Solutol (R) HS 15 inhibiting ABC transporters, were also found to inhibit SLCs in cell cultures. These carriers were SLC16A1, SLC21A3, SLC21A9, SLC15A1-2, and SLC22A1-3. This overlap in specificity of surfactants that inhibit both transporters and carriers might influence the oral absorption of various drug substances, nutrients, and vitamins. Such biopharmaceutical elements may be relevant for future drug formulation design.

AB In brain research, the hCMEC/D3 cell line is widely used for the establishment of a human in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) model. However, its barrier integrity seems to be insufficient for drug permeability studies, represented by rather low transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and high permeability of small molecules. Therefore, this study covers a parametric investigation of static and dynamic cell culture conditions to improve barrier functionality of hCMEC/D3. The effect of basal media was investigated by analyzing changes in proliferation rate, barrier integrity and gene expression of cellular junction proteins. The cells were able to grow in different cell culture media, including serum-free media. However, none of these media enhanced strongly the growth rate or barrier integrity compared to the microvascular endothelial cell growth medium-2 (EGM (TM)-2 MV). Furthermore, hCMEC/D3 cells did not respond positively regarding TEER to any tested parameter neither supplements, coating materials nor co-cultures with the human immortalized astrocyte cell line SVGmm. Furthermore, the impact of dynamic conditions was examined by using the Dynamic Micro Tissue Engineering System (DynaMiTES). Cultivation conditions were successfully adapted to the DynaMiTES design and no negative effect was detected by analyzing cell viability and cell count, albeit TEER remained also unchanged. Consequently, the hCMEC/D3 model has considerable limitations and further improvements or alternative cell lines are required.

AB There is a need for bio-predictive and well-characterized in vitro release models in the development of intraarticular depot formulations. Here, the commercially-available Scissor system, a membrane-based two-compartment release testing instrument, was applied to characterize the transport and release of the drug diclofenac employing conditions intended to mimic transport in the synovial joint. The fate of hyaluronic acid and human serum albumin, the main bio-relevant components incorporated in the system, was investigated. A promising strategy for providing sustained drug release upon intra-articular administration are lipid-based preformulations forming non-lamellar liquid crystalline phases in situ. The usefulness of the Scissor system for investigating the initial drug release from these delivery systems was evaluated. The diclofenac release rate upon injection of an aqueous solution was influenced by the composition of the injection site matrix, i.e. the hyaluronic acid content. Hyaluronic acid and human serum albumin were found to escape from the donor compartment into the acceptor medium through the employed polycarbonate membrane. Sustained diclofenac release was obtained by formation of highly viscous liquid crystalline phases upon injection of the lipid-based preformulations. The study shows the feasibility and potential of the Scissor system for testing initial release of intra-articular depot formulations of low-molecular-weight drug compounds.

AB Particle size distribution (PSD) variability in excipients may cause unacceptable prolongation of mixing time needed to achieve blend homogeneity. Therefore, it is vital to modulate mixing through real-time monitoring of PSD variability. Notwithstanding the criticality of PSD variability, real-time measurement of PSD during mixing is relatively unexplored; and this is the focus of the present study. The model excipient was commercial grade lactose with modified PSD that conformed to the manufacturer's specifications. It was mixed with micro-crystalline cellulose and chlorpheniramine in a double-cone blender. High and low dose blends were prepared and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to collect spectral data, during mixing, for chemometric modelling of PSD. Four modelling approaches based on partial least squares regression (PLSR) were applied. The models were highly interpretable and rapidly measured PSD near the beginning of mixing (5th to 6th rotation), with accuracy (relative standard error of prediction < 5.0%, r(2) approximate to 1.00, slope approximate to 1.00). Therefore, NIR chemo-metric modelling is a viable strategy to detect variability in PSD of excipients during blending and could enable real-time control of mixing. Most significantly, this strategy is potentially transferable to the monitoring and controlling of batch and continuous processes, where PSD is either a source of process variability or a critical quality attribute.

AB This paper presents in situ time-resolved drug mass fraction measurements in pressurised metered dose inhaler (PMDI) sprays, using a novel combination of synchrotron X-ray fluorescence and scattering. Equivalent suspension and solution formulations of ipratropium bromide in HFA-134a propellant were considered. Measurements were made both inside the expansion chamber behind the nozzle orifice, and in the first few millimeters of the spray where droplet and particle formation occur. We observed a consistent spike in drug mass fraction at the beginning of the spray when the first fluid exits the nozzle orifice. Approximately 20% of the total delivered dose exits the nozzle in the first 0.1 s of the spray. The drug mass fraction in the droplets immediately upon exiting the nozzle peaked at approximately 50% of the canister mass fraction, asymptoting to approximately 20% of the canister concentration. The effect is due to a change in the drug mass fraction inside the droplets, rather than changes in droplet size or distribution. The transient was found to originate inside the expansion chamber. We propose that this effect may be a major contributor to low delivery efficiency in PMDIs, and have important implications for oropharyngeal deposition and inhalation technique. This highlights the importance of expansion chamber and nozzle design on the structure of PMDI sprays, and indicates areas of focus that may lead to improvement in drug delivery outcomes.

TI The development of an inline Raman spectroscopic analysis method as a
   quality control tool for hot melt extruded ramipril fixed-dose
   combination products

AB Currently in the pharmaceutical industry, continuous manufacturing is an area of significant interest. In particular, hot-melt extrusion (HME) offers many advantages and has been shown to significantly reduce the number of processing steps relative to a conventional product manufacturing line. To control product quality during HME without process interruption, integration of inline analytical technology is critical. Vibrational spectroscopy (Raman, NIR and FT-IR) is often employed and used for real-time measurements because of the nondestructive and rapid nature of these analytical techniques. However, the establishment of reliable Process Analytical Technology (PAT) tools for HME of thermolabile drugs is challenging. Indeed, the Raman effect is inherently weak and might be subject to interference. Moreover, during HME, heating and photodecomposition can occur and disrupt spectra acquisition. The aim of this research article was to explore the use of inline Raman spectroscopy to characterise a thermolabile drug, ramipril (RMP), during continuous HME processing. Offline measurements by HPLC, LC-MS and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterise RMP and its main degradation product, ramipril-diketopiperazine (RMP-DKP, impurity K). A set of HME experiments together with inline Raman spectroscopic analyses were performed. The feasibility of implementing inline Raman spectroscopic analysis to quantify the level of RMP and RMP-DKP in the extrudate was addressed. Two regions in the Raman spectrum were selected to differentiate RMP and RMP-DKP. When regions were combined, a principle component analysis (PCA) model defined by these two main components (PC 1 = 50.1% and PC 2 = 45%) was established. Using HPLC analyses, we were able to confirm that the PC 1 score was attributed to the level of RMP-DKP, and the PC 2 score was related to the RMP drug content. Investigation of the PCA scatterplot indicated that HME processing temperature was not the only factor causing RMP degradation. Additionally, the plasticiser content, feeding speed and screw rotating speed contributed to RMP degradation during HME processing.

AB This paper presents a new Process Analytical Technology based on the use of an infrared camera and a mathematical model to estimate the ice crystal size distribution obtained at the end of the freezing stage of a vial freeze-drying process. Both empirical laws and first-principle based equations, already presented in the Literature, may be used to this purpose, if the temperature gradient in the frozen product and the freezing front rate are obtained from the analysis of the thermal images. The resistance of the dried product to vapor flux may be then calculated from the distribution of the ice crystal diameters, thus enabling the use of a one-dimensional model for process simulation and optimization. Freeze-drying of 5% and 10% w/w aqueous sucrose solutions, and of 5% w/w aqueous mannitol solutions, were considered as case study. The results were validated comparing the calculated diameters of the pores of the dried cake, corresponding to the ice crystal diameters, with the results experimentally obtained from the analysis of the SEM images, and comparing the values of drying duration and maximum product temperature calculated with the mathematical model with those measured experimentally. Results evidences the effectiveness of the proposed system for process monitoring.

AB We present here the development of a photochemical model used to quantify the risk to photodegradation of a solid drug substance. A key feature of the proposed model development is streamlined estimation of the dependence of the absorption spectra and the quantum yield to the wavelength. A mathematical description of the relationship between the quantum yield and the wavelength enables estimation of photodegradation kinetics under any light anticipated to be encountered in the manufacturing environment. The system studied here consisted of a first order irreversible transformation (A -> B(1 Phi)) and the formalism strongly suggested the quantum yield was constant over the relevant wavelength range. The predictive power of the model enabled the design of a control strategy to limit the formation of the photo-degradant to very low levels. Also presented are insights obtained from quantum mechanical modeling of the electronic transitions associated with the UV absorption spectra.

AB The optical and swelling properties of gatifloxacin-loaded contact lens decrease owing to the precipitation of gatifloxacin (on hydration) in the matrix structure of the contact lens. This paper focuses on the use of Pluronic F68 both inside and outside (in the packaging solution) the contact lens to form micelles to dissolve the gatifloxacin precipitates and not limited to sustain the release of gatifloxacin. The aim of this study was to screen the critical variables affecting the optical and swelling properties of gatifloxacin-loaded contact lens. The independent variables investigated were the concentration of Pluronic F68 incorporated in the monomer solution to fabricate the lens (X-1, %w/v), the concentration of Pluronic F68 in the packaging solution (X-2, %w/v), the concentration of gatifloxacin incorporated in the monomer solution (X-3, %w/v), the concentration of gatifloxacin incorporated in the packaging solution during autoclave (X-4, %w/v), the concentration of gatifloxacin incorporated in the packaging solution during extraction (X-5, %w/v), the time (stabilization time) after the addition of gatifloxacin and Pluronic F68 to the monomer solution before the fabrication of the lens (X-6, h), the pH of the packaging solution (X-7), the temperature of the extracted solution (X-8, degrees C), and the curing time for fabricating the contact lens (X-9, min). The gatifloxacin-loaded contact lenses were characterized for their optical transmittances after sterilization on day 1 (Y-1, %), optical transmittances after 7 days of sterilization (Y-2, %) and swelling percentages after 7 days of sterilization (Y-3, %). The selected variables showed responses that were in the ranges 53.5% to 97.2%, 51.3% to 92.6%, and 50.3% to 83.7% for Y-1, Y-2, and Y-3, respectively. The data suggest that the presence of Pluronic F68 inside the contact lens (X-1) reduced the optical and swelling properties of the contact lens, whereas the presence of Pluronic F68 in the packaging solution (X-2) improved them through micelle formation. The other variables (X-3 to X-9) did not exhibit significant effects on the swelling and transmittance. This study revealed the potential of Plackets-Burman design to screen the selected critical variables that affected the optical and swelling properties of gatifloxacin-loaded contact lens.

AB Cefuroxime Axetil (CA) is a poorly soluble, broad spectrum antibiotic which undergoes enzymatic degradation in gastrointestinal tract. The objective of the present study was to develop lipid-based gastro-retentive floating drug delivery systems containing CA using hot-melt extrusion (HME) to improve absorption. Selected formulations of CA and lipids were extruded using a twin screw hot-melt extruder. Milled extrudates were characterized for dissolution, floating strength, and micromeritic properties. Solid-state characterization was performed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and hot-stage microscopy. In vitro characterization demonstrated that the formulations exhibited a sustained drug release profile for 12 h. All formulations showed desired floating and flow properties. Solid-state characterization revealed no phase separation and no chemical interactions between the drug and excipients. Based on in vitro study results, an optimized formulation (F8) was further evaluated for in vivo performance. Oral bioavailability (C(ma)(x )and AUC(0)(-)(24h)) of F8 was significantly higher than that of pure CA. This study describes the use of lipid-based gastro-retentive floating drug delivery systems to achieve desired sustained release profile for more complete dissolution which could potentially reduce enzymatic degradation. This study also highlights the effectiveness of HME technology to improve dissolution and bioavailability.

AB The physicochemical properties and drug release characteristics of Q1/Q2 equivalent microspheres are sensitive to minor manufacturing changes, which may alter their stability under different storage-conditions. This may be undesirable due to the presence of a substantial amount of drug in microsphere products. Hence, the objective of the present work was to investigate the impact of minor manufacturing changes on the stability of Q1/Q2 equivalent microspheres under various storage conditions. Two Q1/Q2 equivalent risperidone microsphere formulations prepared with minor manufacturing changes (solvent system etc.) showed differences in their physicochemical properties (size, morphology, porosity etc.), drug release characteristics and hence, storage stability. Overall, both formulations were stable under long-term storage conditions (4 degrees C/ambient humidity). However, under the intermediate storage conditions (25 degrees C/ambient humidity), only formulation 1 was stable while formulation 2 showed significant polymer degradation, particle aggregation and alteration in the drug release characteristics. Lastly, under accelerated storage conditions (40 degrees C/ambient humidity vs 75% RH), the extent of polymer degradation, morphological changes and alteration of drug release characteristics of formulation 2 was significantly higher compared to that of formulation 1. Thus, minor manufacturing changes have the potential to significantly alter the storage stability and, hence, the quality and performance of complex drug products such as microspheres.

AB The effect of mild hyperthermia (MHT) on nanoparticle (NP) accumulation in rat model liver metastasis and the contribution of neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells were characterized. CdSe/ZnS QD-doped poly(lactic-coglycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs (155 +/- 10 nm) were delivered via the ileocolic vein to metastatic livers 15 min after localized MW irradiation (1 min, 41 degrees C) or in normothermia (37 degrees C, NT). Quantitative analysis of tissue sections by confocal fluorescence microscopy 1 h after NP injection showed no NP tumor accumulation in NT. On the contrary, MHT increased NP association with tumor, compared to normal tissue. Counterstaining of specific markers showed that the MHT effect is due to an increased NP endocytosis not only by tumor cells, but also by hepatocytes at the growing tumor edge and, to a minor extent, by tumor-associated macrophages. High-NP capturing hepatocytes, close to the tumor, may be a relevant phenomenon in MHT-induced increased targeting of NPs to liver metastasis, influencing their therapeutic efficacy.

AB The near-infrared dye, IR780 iodide, has been utilized in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). However, the hydrophobicity and photosensitivity of IR780 limit its further applications in biomedical fields. Herein, the hydrophilic sericin was modified with hydrophobic cholesterol to form an amphiphilic macromolecular conjugate (Ser-Chol). The tumor-targeting agent, folic acid (FA), was further linked to the conjugate (FA-Ser-Chol). The IR780 could be encapsulated into such amphiphilic macromolecule to form stable micelles (FA-Ser-Chol/IR780) by self-assembly, and the solubility and photo-stability of IR780 were greatly improved. The FA-Ser-Chol/IR780 micelles could be efficiently absorbed by FA-positive gastric cancer cells (BGC-823) through FA receptors, while the uptake micelles showed remarkable PDT and PTT cytotoxicity towards BGC-823 cells under laser irradiation of 808 nm. Therefore, FA-Ser-Chol micelles may serve as a promising IR780 carrier for PDT and PTT therapy.

AB Although zein is a natural protein derived from corn, it has attracted much interest in pharmaceutical and biomedical sciences. Recent remarkable investigations on the use of zein in controlled drug delivery have contributed both important knowledge and potential applications of various products, particularly in the delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs. Zein has also been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for oral delivery. Substantial research has been performed to demonstrate the roles and promise of materials containing zein for pharmaceutical applications. Significant efforts have focused on the biodegradable and hydrophobic properties of zein and on technology using zein as a nanocarrier specifically for nanomedicine. However, important issues concerning the use of zein in technical advances and in the development of poorly water-soluble drugs must be addressed in order to use zein in translational research. This review aims to focus on the classification of potential approaches for using zein in the controlled release of poorly water-soluble drugs and to discuss recommended techniques for creating high-quality products from zein.

AB The objective of the study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile after different subcutaneous (s.c.) administrations of nano- and microparticle suspensions of griseofulvin to mice. The solubility of the compound was determined as approximately 40 mu M, at 37 degrees C, independent of particle size, stabilizer mixtures investigated and solvent used for measurement. The present in vivo studies demonstrated non-linear absorption kinetics (in peak concentration, C-max) for griseofulvin up to 50 mg/kg after s.c. administration of nanocrystals and micro-suspensions but linear increase in area under the curve (AUC) at all occasions investigated. C-max was higher for smaller particles administered. Both investigated suspensions, at 10 and 50 mg/kg, showed significantly sustained plasma profiles compared to i.v. and p.o. administration. Administering 10 and 50 mg/kg of griseofulvin nanocrystals as 10 mL/kg, instead of 2.5 mL/kg, improved C-max but AUC was unchanged. The present study showed that the bioavailability of griseofulvin, administered as nano- and microparticles, increased significantly after s.c. administration (60-100%) compared with p.o. dosing (17%). The drug is currently orally administered and clearly exposed to a significant first pass metabolism, i.e. an ideal candidate for an alternative administration route, like s.c. injection.

AB Methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (mPEG-PCL) polymeric micelles (PMs) open a promising avenue through which ocular drug delivery with superior efficacy and tolerability can be potentially obtained. Methazolamide (MTZ) is an anti-glaucoma drug exhibiting poor corneal penetration, making it an ideal candidate for new polymeric micellar systems. MTZ-PMs were prepared using the thin film hydration procedure and optimized using a Design of Experiment (DoE) approach. In vitro drug release, thermal analyses and FT-IR characterization were also evaluated. MTT assay and histopathological assessment were carried out to verify ocular tolerability as well as Draize irritancy test. In vivo studies were conducted on rabbits to evaluate antiglaucoma activity in a glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma model. The results showed successful entrapment of MTZ inside PMs matrix as reflected by the complete vanishing of drug melting peak in DSC thermogram and the possible formation of hydrogen bonding between MTZ and mPEG-PCL copolymer in FT-IR spectrum. The selected formula exhibited a particle size of 60 nm, entrapment efficiency of 93% and discrete spherical particles. Moreover, sustained release of MTZ, cellular and tissue biocompatibility and marked anti-glaucoma efficacy, as compared to MTZ solution, were realized. The combined results show that PMs could potentiate the therapeutic outcome of nanotechnology ocular drug delivery.

AB Main purpose of present study was to enhance the therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of colon adenocarcinoma by combining the benefits of chemotherapy and gene therapy. In this study, we have successfully formulated oxaliplatin (OXL) and miRNA-204-5p loaded polyethyleneimine (PEI)/hyaluronic acid (HA)-assembled mesoporous silica nanoparticles (OXmi-HSMN). Our study, for the first time, proved that miRNA-204-5p can generate a synergistic anticancer effect with OXL with HMSN, and thus improve the effects of therapeutic efficacy in colon cancers. In vitro targeting studies showed that OXmi-HSMN exhibited higher uptake efficiency in CD44 receptor over-expressed HT-29 cells via CD44 receptor-mediated endocytosis. OXmi-HMSN exhibited a higher cell cytotoxicity compared to any other formulations indicating that internalization via CD44 receptor-mediated endocytosis increased the anticancer effect. The OXmi-HMSN showed significantly higher pre-apoptotic cells (43.9%) with significant apoptosis fractions (upper right quadrant - 20%) indicating the superior anticancer efficacy in terms of apoptosis inducing potentials. Importantly, OXmi-HMSN caused conspicuous inhibition of tumor growth and was significantly greater than that of either OXL or OXL-MSN (p < 0.0001). OXmi-HMSN showed 30% of TUNEL positive cells compared to 8% TUNEL positive cells for free OXL and 6% for free miRNA-204-5p treated group indicating the wide spread apoptosis of cells throughout the tissue section. Current study provides a delivery platform for dual therapeutics for enhanced therapeutic efficacy in the management of colon cancer.

AB Limited supersaturation maintaining duration is the main challenge for amorphous solid dispersion design. Nucleation or crystal growth inhibitors may function in different ways but the combination use of nucleation and crystal growth inhibitors in supersaturated system is rarely explored. Thus, using Lacidipine (LCDP) as a Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) II model drug, the aim of this study was to explore whether the combination use of nucleation and crystal growth inhibitors could provide a synergistic effect on the in vitro-in vivo performance of poorly water-soluble drugs. First of all, based on compatibility screening using solubility parameter (Delta delta) and crystallization inhibition efficiency as criteria, soluplus (SOL) and gum arabic (GA) were selected as the most effective nucleation and crystal growth inhibitor respectively. Thereafter, the supersaturated drug solutions were spray dried and characterized. The in vitro release, physical stability as well as pharmacokinetic behavior were investigated. It was found that the combination use of SOL and GA did not present remarkable advantage in prolonging the supersaturation time in solution state. However, their synergistic effect in equilibrium solubility and dissolution enhancement was noticed at SOL/GA ratio 3:1, with 5-7 times higher dissolution rate observed for LCDP/SOL/GA based formulation compared with that of LCDP/SOL, which was maintained even after three months accelerated stability test under non-sink condition. Moreover, compared to the LCDP/SOL formulation, approximately 2.8 and 2.5-fold increase in the maximum plasma concentration (C-max) and the area under the plasma-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) was achieved with LCDP/SOL/GA based formulation. Possible mechanism of the synergistic effect was elucidated, indicating GA may penetrate into SOL particles providing both electrostatic and steric stabilization. In conclusion, the combination use of screened nucleation and crystal growth inhibitors might be an efficient approach to design supersaturated drug delivery system.

AB Cell macroencapsulation has shown a great potential overcoming the low survival of the transplanted pancreatic islets in the Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) treatment, as it avoids the need for lifelong immunosuppression. It is still not completely known how these devices interact with the host immune system when implanted. However, their surface properties seem to be crucial factors for a successful implant. In this context, the hydrophilicity and porosity of the surface of the macrocapsules are two of the most important properties that can affect the functionality of the graft; hydrophilicity defines the interactions with the host's immune cells, while the porosity determines the biosafety of the device while conditioning the oxygen, nutrients and insulin diffusion. Here, we report a novel beta-cell macroencapsulation system that combines an injectable alginate hydrogel with an external 3D-printed implantable device. This external macrocapsule protects the inner hydrogel containing cells, while allowing the precise location of the implant in the body. In addition, it would allow the easy extraction of the grafted cells in the case the implant fails or the renewal of the therapeutic cells is required.
   This study evaluates the biological effect of the macroencapsulation devices' surface properties (hydrophilicity and porosity). We studied two different pore sizes and hydrophilicities in four different devices containing rat INS1E beta-cells embedded in alginate hydrogels. All the devices showed great biocompatibility, although the hydrophilic ones exhibited higher fibroblast adhesion, which could potentially enhance the fibrotic response when implanted. Importantly, INS1E cells did not escape from the devices, denoting high biosafety. Cells grown within all devices and maintained their insulin secretory function. However, the hydrophobic device with a smaller pore size showed better cell viability values and, therefore, it might be the best candidate for the development of a safe beta-cell replacement therapy in T1DM.

AB In this work, the transfer of oral solid dosage forms, currently manufactured via wet granulation, to a continuous direct compression process was considered. Two main challenges were addressed: (1) a poorly flowing API (Canagliflozin) and (2) high drug loading (51 wt %). A scientific approach was utilised for formulation development, targeting flow and compaction behaviour suitable for manufacturing scale. This was achieved through systematic screening of excipients to identify feasible formulations. Targeted design of experiments based on factors such as formulation mixture and processing parameters were utilised to investigate key responses for tablet properties, flow and compaction behaviour. Flow behaviour was primarily evaluated from percentage compressibility and shear cell testing on a powder flow rheometer (FT4). The compaction behaviour was studied using a compaction simulator (Gamlen). The relationships between tablet porosity, tensile strength and compaction pressure were used to evaluate tabletability, compactibility and compressibility to assess scale-up. The success of this design procedure is illustrated by scaling up from the compaction simulator to a Riva Piccola rotary tablet press, while maintaining critical quality attributes (CQAs). Compactibility was identified as a suitable scale-up relationship. The developed procedure should allow accelerated development of formulations for continuous direct compression.

AB Cellulose is a natural homopolymer, composed of beta-1,4- anhydro-D-glucopyranose units. Unlike plant cellulose, bacterial cellulose (BC), obtained from species belonging to the genera of Acetobacter, Rhizobium, Agrobacterium, and Sarcina through various cultivation methods and techniques, is produced in its pure form. BC is produced in the form of gel-like, never dry sheet with tremendous mechanical properties. Containing up to 99% of water, BC hydrogel is considered biocompatible thus finding robust applications in the health industry. Moreover, BC three-dimensional structure closely resembles the extracellular matrix (ECM) of living tissue. In this review, we focus on the porous BC morphology particularly suited to host oxygen and nutrients thus providing conducive environment for cell growth and proliferation. The remarkable BC porous morphology makes this biological material a promising templet for the generation of 3D tissue culture and possibly for tissue-engineered scaffolds.

AB This study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of developing inhalable dry powders of liposomal encapsulated ciprofloxacin nanocrystals (LECN) for controlled drug release. Dry powders of LECN were produced by freeze-thaw followed by spray drying. The formulations contained sucrose as a lyoprotectant in different weight ratios (0.75:1, 1:1 and 2:1 sucrose to lipids), along with 2% magnesium stearate and 5% isoleucine as aerosolization enhancers. The powder physical properties (particle size, morphology, crystallinity, moisture content), in vitro aerosolization performance, drug encapsulation efficiency and in vitro drug release were investigated. The spray dried powders were comprised of spherical particles with a median diameter of similar to 1 mu m, partially crystalline, with a low water content ( similar to 2% mass) and did not undergo recrystallization at high relative humidity. When dispersed by an Osmohaler (R) inhaler at 100 L/min, the powders showed a high aerosol performance with a fine particle fraction (% wt. < 5 mu m) of 66-70%. After reconstitution of the powders in saline, ciprofloxacin nanocrystals were confirmed by cryo-electron microscopy. The drug encapsulation efficiency of the reconstituted liposomes was 71-79% compared with the stock liquid formulation. Of the three formulations, the one containing a sucrose to lipids wt. ratio of 2:1 demonstrated a prolonged release of ciprofloxacin from the liposomes. In conclusion, ciprofloxacin nanocrystal liposomal powders were prepared that were suitable for inhalation aerosol delivery and controlled drug release.

AB Pulmonary delivery is a highly attractive alternative to injections for biologics such as therapeutic proteins. However, bioavailabilities generally suffer from the presence of phagocytic cells that clear particulate matter entering the lung. In this study, microgel particles were developed using an all-aqueous two-phase system approach and evaluated for their efficacy as an inhalable controlled release system. Norbornene- and thiol-modified four- and eight-armed poly (ethylene glycol) with an average molecular mass of 10,000 Da were prepared as macromonomers for microgel formation. Emulsions of precursor solution droplets containing macromonomers and Irgacure 2959 as photocatalyst were prepared in a dextran solution. Irradiation with UV light was used to covalently crosslink the droplets by triggering the thiol-ene reaction. The resulting microgels were processed to dry powder inhaler formulations, and respirable aerodynamic sizes were assessed in vitro. Microgels were loaded with the model proteins lysozyme and bovine serum albumin, with encapsulation efficiencies of 51.5% and 73.6%, respectively. Depending on the macromonomer type, protein-loaded microgels released their cargo over a 6-14 day period. In an MTT assay, the particles did not show significant cytotoxicity, and their recognition by alveolar macrophages was considerably lower than for polystyrene control particles. This makes the microgels a promising pulmonary delivery system for proteins and other biologics.

AB Multivariate data analysis (MVDA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) are supporting statistical methodologies required for successful development and manufacturing of drug products. To address this purpose, a complex dataset from 49 industrially produced capsules filled with pellets was first analyzed through the development of a multiple linear regression model focused on determining raw material attributes or process parameters with a significant impact on drug dissolution. Based on the model, the following molecular and micrometrics properties of K-carrageenan have been identified as critical material attributes with the highest contribution to drug dissolution: molecular weight and polydispersity index, viscosity, content of potassium ions, wettability, particle size, and density. The process parameters identified to control the drug dissolution behavior of pellets were amount of granulation liquid, torque of dry blend, spheronization parameters, and yields after screening. To further scrutinize the dataset, an ANN model was subsequently built, incorporating 29 batches addressing drug particle size and process parameters such as torque during granulation and spheronization time as critical factors. Finally, this study demonstrates the ability of MVDA and ANN to allow prediction of the key performance drivers influencing the drug dissolution of industrially developed capsules filled with pellets and it highlights their complementary relationship.

AB The stability of azithromycin in buffered aqueous solution at pH 6.7 was investigated in the presence of different cyclodextrin (CD) additives by HPLC monitoring of the drug concentration over time. In the presence of gamma-CDs, either in native or derivatized form, the long-term stability of azithromycin was sensibly decreased with respect to the reference sample without any additives, whereas the opposite effect was observed with all the three tested beta-CDs. The most effective stabilization of the drug was obtained by using sulfobutyl ether-beta-cyclodextrin, which allowed a concentration of azithromycin in solution at 99% up to 6 months at room temperature. The positive action of sulfobutyl ether-beta-cyclodextrin was mainly exerted through the suppression of a degradation pathway leading to the opening of lactone ring of azithromycin. The formation of dynamic inclusion complexes in solution was ruled out by NMR data and stabilization of azithromycin by the amphiphilic sulfobutyl ether-beta-cyclodextrin through surfactant-like effects was proposed on the basis of the strict similarity, either in the degradation profiles and in the NMR data, with a solution of the drug in the presence of sodium hexylsulphonate as surfactant.

AB Liposomes are potent adjuvant constituents for licensed vaccines and vaccine candidates and carriers for drug delivery. Depending on the method of preparation, liposomes vary in size distribution, either forming uniform small size vesicles or a heterogeneous mixture of small to large vesicles. Importantly, differences in liposomal size have been demonstrated to induce differential immune responses. Determination of particle size distribution could therefore be crucial for the efficacy and stability of vaccine formulations.
   We compared the techniques of dynamic light scattering, laser diffraction, and conventional nanoparticle tracking analysis with a novel multispectral advanced nanoparticle tracking analysis (MANTA) for particle size determination of mono- and polydisperse liposomes. MANTA reported an average 146 nm size of monodisperse liposomes but showed a multimodal distribution of polydisperse liposomes with continuous sizes from 50 to 2000 nm. However, approximately 95% of particles were in the size range of 50-1500 nm and only few particles were identified in the 1500-2000 nm range for the investigated volume.
   Based on our results, we conclude that MANTA is the most suitable approach and can serve as stand-alone technique for particle size characterization of heterogeneous liposome samples in the 50-2000 nm size range.

AB Preparation of lipid-based drug delivery systems by microfluidics has been increasingly popular, due to the reproducible, continuous and scalable nature of the microfluidic process. Despite exciting development in the field, versatility and superiority of microfluidics over conventional methods still need further evidence, since preparing clinically-relevant sterically stabilised liposomes has been lacking. The present study describes the optimisation of PEGylated liposomal formulations of various rigidity using staggered herringbone micromixer (SHM). The effect of both processing parameters (total flow rate (TFR) and aqueous-to-ethanol flow rate ratio (FRR)) and formulation parameters (lipid components and composition, initial lipid concentration and aqueous media) was investigated and discussed. Liposomal formulations consist of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) or 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DSPC), with cholesterol and PEGylated lipid (DSPE-PEG(2000)) were successfully prepared with the desired size (similar to 100 nm) and dispersity (< 0.2). Doxorubicin was successfully encapsulated in these liposomes at high (> 80%) encapsulation efficiency using the pH-gradient remote loading method, illustrating their bilayer integrity and capability as drug delivery systems. We demonstrated that clinically-relevant PEGylated liposomal formulations could be prepared with properties comparable to conventional techniques. Limitations and recommendations on the microfluidic production of PEGylated liposomes were also discussed.

AB Despite their great potential, the nano-sized extracellular vesicles are yet to become effective delivery systems for poorly water-soluble drugs. Here, we present a novel platform of exosomes as a drug delivery system by engineering of a poorly water-soluble drug into a poloxamer-based molecular nanostructured dispersion composed of a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic moiety for an enhanced anticancer efficacy. For the first time, aspirin was loaded into exosomes as an anticancer agent via a one-step fabrication combining the nano-matrix formation of the nanostructured dispersion and exosomes loading. Our approach could transform crystalline aspirin to a nanoamorphous form in the nano-matrix structured exosomes, leading to increased drug encapsulation efficiency for exosomes, improved dissolution and strongly enhanced cytotoxicity of aspirin to cancer cells. Interestingly, cytotoxicity of aspirin to both breast and colorectal cancer cells could be strongly enhanced by the nanoamorphous aspirin-loaded exosomes, and this cytotoxic effect was more pronounced to parental cells of the exosomes, reminiscent of homing effect. Hence, this study has pioneered a novel nanoplatform of nanoamorphous exosomal delivery system to transform an anti-inflammatory drug into a potent anti-cancer agent.

AB In this study, a facile, economically feasible, and scalable approach to fabricate macroporous poly(vinyl alcohol)-GO (PVA-GO) nanocomposite films with varying filler loadings was demonstrated. The nanocomposite films were prepared using a solvent casting process and employed as a diffusion layer for modulating the transdermal delivery of an anti-inflammatory drug (i.e., ketoprofen). The diffusion membrane was assembled in a three-layer structure with PVA/PVA-GO films between ketoprofen-loaded cellulose and cellulose acetate to mimic skin barrier. Through the incorporation of GO sheets into PVA matrix, the mass diffusion and drug release rate of ketoprofen could be modulated to attain a controlled-release system within period in comparison to that of neat PVA film, which showed more rapid release. It was observed that the dispersion level of GO sheets in the polymer matrix played a crucial role to slow the diffusion rate and drug release, where 3 wt% filler loading gave the slowest rate of release. The results from the present study shed light on the mechanism of and may provide guidelines for modulating drug release rates of NSAID in film-based delivery vehicles for transdermal delivery applications.

AB Liposome based delivery systems provide a promising strategy for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. A rational design of brain-targeted liposomes can support the development of more efficient treatments with drugs and gene materials. Here, we characterized surface modified liposomes with transferrin (Tf) protein and penetratin (Pen), a cell-penetrating peptide, for efficient and targeted gene delivery to brain cells. PenTf-liposomes efficiently encapsulated plasmid DNA, protected them against enzymatic degradation and exhibited a sustained in vitro release kinetics. The formulation demonstrated low cytotoxicity and was non-hemolytic. Liposomes were internalized into cells mainly through energy-dependent pathways especially clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Reporter gene transfection and consequent protein expression in different cell lines were significantly higher using PenTf-liposomes compared to unmodified liposomes. The ability of these liposomes to escape from endosomes can be an important factor which may have likely contributed to the high transfection efficiency observed. Rationally designed bifunctional targeted-liposomes provide an efficient tool for improving the target-ability and efficacy of synthesized delivery systems. This investigation of liposomal properties attempted to address cell differences, as well as, vector differences, in gene transfectability. The findings indicate that PenTf-liposomes can be a safe and non-invasive approach to transfect neuronal cells through multiple endocytosis pathways.

AB Tumor cells avoid immunosurveillance during the tumorigenesis, metastasis and recurrence periods thanks to the overexpressed immunosuppressive molecules on their surface. For instance, the programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) binds with the T-cells' programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) impairing the anti-tumor activity of the host T cells. In this study, a new reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsive nanoparticle (NP), modified with the HAIYPRH (T7) peptide, was developed for the co-delivery of siRNA-PD-L1 and doxorubicin (Dox). These NPs can block the inhibitory signal responding to T cells and enhance cytotoxicity of Dox against tumor cells. The T7 modification binds to the overexpressed transferrin receptor on tumor cells facilitating its cellular uptake. Dox rapid release is then triggered by the high tumor cells cytoplasmic concentration of ROS, leading to cell apoptosis. Our results demonstrated these NPs exhibited a T7-mediated cellular uptake and an intracellular ROS-triggered payloads release in vitro. They also suggested an improved in vivo 4T1 tumor targeting efficiency and chemoimmunotherapy. Most notably, the co-delivery system exhibited a significantly enhanced antitumor effect over Dox-only loaded NPs following prompting the proliferation of T cells by siRNA-PD-L1. In conclusion, these ROS-responsive NPs provided a promising strategy to combine siRNA-PD-L1 immunotherapy and Dox chemotherapy.

AB Pharmaceutical cocrystals have gained increasing interest due to their potential to modify the physicochemical properties of drugs. Herein, a 1:1 cocrystal of ibuprofen (IBU) as a BCS class II active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and nicotinamide as coformer was produced using a hot-melt extrusion (HME) process. The effect of process parameters such as barrel temperature and screw speed were studied. It was shown that the addition of polymeric excipient such as soluplus (Sol) decreases the cocrystallization temperature by enhancing the interaction between API and coformer. In order to study the effect of cocrystallization on the tableting properties of IBU-NIC cocrystal, 5 different formulations of pure IBU, IBU-NIC cocrystal, IBU-NIC physical mixture, IBU-NIC-Sol physical mixture and IBU-NIC-Sol cocrystal were tableted by a compaction simulator. Tabletability, compactibility and compressibility were investigated. The sample with IBU-NIC-Sol cocrystal formulation out-performed all the other formulations in terms of tabletability, compactibility and compressibility. Interestingly, this sample was even superior to the IBU-NIC cocrystal sample which verified the advantageous effect of the presence of an excipient. Moreover, dissolution test confirmed a noticeable increase in the dissolution of not only the cocrystal samples but even the physical mixtures of IBU and NIC compared with pure IBU.

AB Nowadays many drugs with improved therapeutic efficacy are discovered but cannot be utilized due to their low solubility and insufficient bioavailability. An example of such a drug molecule is a protein kinase C inhibitor that influences an enzyme which plays an important role in several signal transduction cascades. The aim of this study was to formulate a stable nanoparticle dispersion of the PKC inhibitor encapsulated into PLGA nano-particles (NPs). Encapsulation of the PKC inhibitor into PLGA NPs of 100-200 nm diameter should provide a targeted delivery to the inflammation sites. The NPs were prepared via nanoprecipitation and different surfactants were investigated: Fully and partially hydrolyzed poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, Mowiol X-88 and X-98), poloxamers (Pluronic F68 and F127) and polysorbates (Tween 20 and 80). From all surfactants tested, only NPs prepared with partially hydrolyzed PVA (Mowiol X-88) provided the desired stability throughout the downstream processes. These NPs were subsequently analyzed regarding their particle size, polydispersity, encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity. Dynamic light scattering results revealed that monodisperse NPs of 150-220 nm were formed, a size range that favors targeted delivery. The drug encapsulation efficiency varied from 31 to 75% with a drug loading of 1.3-2%. Moreover, the long-term stability was studied and the residual amount of PVA of the NP solutions was quantified via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The shell-less hen's egg model was used to test toxic effects (hemorrhage, vascular lysis, thrombosis, hemolysis and lethality) of the NPs in a more complex biological system under dynamic flow conditions.

AB Background: Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type VI, also known as Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome, is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in arylsulfatase B (ARSB) enzyme. Our objectives were to investigate clinical phenotypes and performed molecular studies in Iranian patients with MPS VI, for the first time, in the southwestern Iran.
   Methods: We studied 14 cases from 10 unrelated kindreds with MPS VI that were enrolled during 8 years. The mutational analysis of coding and flanking regions of ARSB gene was performed for the patients and their families using genomic DNA from whole blood by direct sequencing.
   Results: All cases had parental consanguinity. Except one who had Fars ethnicity and presented with a very mild degree of coarse face, but normal otherwise, even near normal height, all were from Arab ethnicity with characteristic phenotypes including severe facial changes, cardiac involvement and dysostosis multiplex. Sequencing analysis of ARSB gene revealed four pathogenic homozygote mutations, including a novel nonsense mutation c.281C > A (p.Ser94X) in 9 patients, as well as, a known nonsense mutation c.753C > G (p.Try251X) in 3 cases, and two missense mutations c.904G > A (p.Gly302Arg) and c.454C > T (p.Arg152Trp) in two cases. The type of mutations affected the severity patient's phenotypes.
   Conclusions: These findings increased the genetic databases of Iranian patients with MPS VI and would be so much helpful for the high-risk families to speed the detection of carriers with accuracy and perform the prenatal test of disorder with cost-effective in this population.

AB Factor XII (FXII) is a coagulation protein that initiates surface-activation of the coagulation cascade in vitro. The protein's in vivo role, however, remains poorly defined. Factor XII deficiency, or Hageman trait, is a rare hereditary disorder that is not associated with bleeding, and wide variations in FXII activity (FXII:C) exist among healthy people. While FXII-deficient knockout mice appear to be resistant to arterial thrombosis, human F12 polymorphisms that influence FXII:C have not been associated with thrombotic risk in population surveys. Factor XII deficiency is a naturally occurring hereditary trait in domestic cats. We undertook phenotypic and genotypic analyses of FXII-deficient cats for comparative studies with the human disease counterpart. A retrospective review of feline submissions to our laboratory revealed that FXII deficiency is common in domestic cats, and also present in many different breeds. The trait has a geographic bias toward the Midwestern United States. Clinical history, coagulation assays, and samples for F12 sequencing were obtained from 26 FXII deficient cats. None of the cats had experienced abnormal bleeding and their residual FXII:C was related to F12 mutation number and mutation-type. We found 2 high frequency F12 mutations: an exon 13 missense mutation (c.1631G > C) and an exon 11 deletion mutation (c.1321delC), and additional sequence variants throughout the gene. Factor XII deficiency in pet cat populations provides an animal model system to help clarify the biologic actions and clinical relevance of FXII protein.

AB Background: Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that increase risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Among genetic factors that contributed to incidence of metabolic syndrome, Polymorphisms of Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) are major candidates especially because of their effect on obesity and dyslipidemia. S447X (rs328) and Hind III (rs320) Polymorphisms of LPL gene have been reported to change LPL activity, resulting in altered triglyceride (TG) and high density lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. This study investigates the effects of these gene polymorphisms on factors affecting metabolic syndrome in northern population of Iran.
   Methods: Studied population included 223 adults consisting 90 women and 133 men with body mass index (BMI) >= 30 kg/m(2) as obese subjects, and 156 healthy participants as a control group with BMI < 25 that included 68 women and 88 men. All factors causing metabolic syndrome were evaluated. Also DNA was extracted from blood samples and HindIII and S447X LPL gene polymorphisms were screened by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method (PCR-RFLP).
   Conclusions: The present study proves that some genotypes of HindIII were associated with a reduced risk of developing low HDL-C only in men, while the protective effects of S447X on hypertriglyceridemia were only seen in women. The point is that this relation is affected by the weight profile of the participants. It can be concluded that there is a gender-related relation between the polymorphisms of LPL gene and the risk factors for incidence of metabolic syndrome in the northern population of Iran.

AB The fem-1 gene in Caenorhabditis elegans is involved in sex differentiation; it is specifically required for all aspects of male development. In this study, the full-length cDNA of the fem-1 (Pvfem-1) gene was isolated from the Pacific whiteleg shrimp Penaeus vannamei. The Pvfem-1 transcript is 3778 nt long and encodes a putative protein (PvFEM-1) of 638 amino acids that presented eight ankyrin repeats. The translated protein showed a significant (P < 0.05) structural similitude by superposition with C. elegans FEM-1 protein. Pvfem-1 expression was evaluated by qPCR and in situ hybridization (ISH) during embryogenesis, larval development, and gonads of both genders in subadult and adult life stages. Pvfem-1 was found expressed in brain, intestine, hepatopancreas, and in the gonads of both genders in subadults and adults when quantified by RT-qPCR. A significant finding was the discovery of a natural antisense transcript (NAT) of Pvfem-1 by ISH. It was present in the oocyte nucleus of subadult female shrimp gonads but was not seen within oocytes from adult females, although it was detected in follicular cells, suggesting a possible post-transcriptional regulation of Pvfem-1 in female gonad. Conversely, in males, no NAT was observed, and Pvfem-1 was found expressed in spermatogonia of both, subadult and adult shrimps indicating a function in male sexual differentiation and gametes generation. This study represents the first step for future functional analysis that is expected to contribute to clarifying the role of Pvfem-1 in sex differentiation and determination.

AB The chloroplastic thioredoxins (Trxs), a family of thiol-disulphide oxidoreductases, are reduced by either ferredoxin (Fd)-dependent Trx reductase (FTR) or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent Trx reductase (NTR). Two Trx systems are present in chloroplasts including Trxs, Trx-like proteins, and reductase FTR and NTRC. FTR is the main reductant for Trxs in chloroplasts, while the flavoprotein NTRC integrates NTR and Trx activity, and plays multiple roles in the Calvin cycle, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP), anti-peroxidation, tetrapyrrole metabolism, ATP and starch synthesis, and photoperiodic regulation. In addition, not only there exists a reduction potential transfer pathway across the thylakoid membrane, but also FTR and NTRC coordinate with each other to regulate chloroplast redox homeostasis. Herein, we summarise the physiological functions of these two Trx reduction systems, discuss how both regulate redox homeostasis in plant plastids, and emphasize the significance of chloroplast thioredoxin systems in maintaining photosynthetic efficiency in plants.

AB Proteins differential expression in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can be due to etiological factors or pathological changes, such proteins can be utilized as biomarkers. Identification of a marker protein out of thousands became a feasible task during the proteomics era by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In this study, blood samples were obtained from 80 Bahraini subjects with and without T2DM, a subset was used for proteomic analysis by LC-MS/MS, while all samples were used for ELISA analysis of 3 proteins, TATA-box binding protein-associated factor RNA polymerase-1-C (TAF1C), ceruloplasmin (CERP) and fibronectin (FN). The former 2 proteins were selected from the T2DM-protein-panel identified by LC-MS/MS, and the latter was analyzed for validation of the setting. The main findings of the proteomic analysis are i. Identifications of 62 differentially expressed proteins in T2DM, ii. Upregulation of 71% of the identified proteins. While the ELISA analysis showed that; both TAF1C and FN were significantly increased in T2DM (P0.015 and P0.001, respectively), while CERP was not (P0.088). Logistic regression analysis: i. confirmed the above associations after correction for covariates, ii. Revealed an interaction between age and gender that affect the association of the proteins with T2DM. In conclusion, knowing that TAF1C is a prerequisite in ribosomal biogenesis, our ELISA results are suggestive of increased protein synthesis in T2DM, explaining the observed upregulation of the proteins identified by LC-MSMS. The association between T2DM and TAF1C is a novel finding that might open a new avenue in DM research.

AB Insulin is a peptide hormone responsible for stable glycemia, is entirely secreting from pancreatic beta cells at the core of glucose homeostatic regulation. Upon synthesis as preproinsulin on rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), proinsulin is directed to trans Golgi apparatus. Subsequently, proinsulin packaging into secretory granules occurs in a dynamic and highly efficient process. During maturation stage of secretory granules, proinsulin undergoes cleavage and produces insulin and C-peptide upon acidification of the granules due to the activation of ATP-deriven proton pump. Fusion of the insulin containing secretory granules with the plasma membranes takes place after an increase in intracellular Ca2+. Finally, insulin is co-secreting with other components that are present in the secretory granules, including C-peptide, ATP, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), ghrelin and amylin. The other accompanying components of the insulin vesicles play important roles in the insulin secretion, insulin receptor activation and other homeostatic effects.. Responding to the glucose stimulation or increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels, insulin secretion is immediately starts. Whereas, the second phase of insulin secretion is slow and continued, which reaches a plateau within 1-3 hours and lasts for longer period. In contrast to the first phase, the second phase of insulin secretion is independent of the extracellular glucose level. Finally, sequential or compound exocytosis of insulin is repressed to prevent sugar crash arising from excessive and sudden insulin secretion. In this paper we have reviewed the recent progress of molecular scenarios which are behind insulin biogenesis, intracellular sorting and exocytosis events.

AB Blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant entity characterized by eyelid malformations and caused by mutations in the forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) gene. Clinical and genetic analyses of large cohorts of BPES patients from different ethnic origins are important for a better characterization of FOXL2 mutational landscape. The purpose of this study is to describe the phenotypic features and the causal FOXL2 variants in a Mexican cohort of BPES patients. A total of 12 individuals with typical facial findings were included. Clinical evaluation included palpebral measurements and levator function assessment. The complete coding sequence of FOXL2 was amplified by PCR and subsequently analyzed by Sanger sequencing. A total of 11 distinct FOXL2 pathogenic variants were identified in our cohort (molecular diagnostic rate of 92%), including 5 novel mutations. Our results broaden the BPES-related mutational spectrum and supports considerable FOXL2 allelic heterogeneity in our population.

AB The receptor for activated c-kinase (RACK1, Asc1 in yeast) is a eukaryotic ribosomal protein located in the head region of the 40S subunit near the mRNA exit channel. This WD-repeat beta-propeller protein acts as a signaling molecule and is involved in metabolic regulation, cell cycle progression, and translational control. However, the exact details of the RACK1 recruitment and stable association with the 40S ribosomal subunit remain only partially known. X-ray analyses of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ribosome revealed that the RACK1 propeller blade (4-5) interacts with the eukaryote-specific C-terminal domain (CTD) of ribosomal protein S3 (uS3 family). To check the functional significance of this interaction, we generated mutant yeast strains harboring Cterminal deletions of uS3. We found that deletion of the 20 C-terminal residues (interacting with blade 4-5) from the uS3-CTD abrogates RACK1 binding to the ribosome. Strains with truncated uS3-CTD exhibited compromised cellular growth and protein synthesis similar to that of RACK1 Delta strain, thus suggesting that the uS3-CTD is crucial not only for the recruitment and association of RACK1 with the ribosome, but also for its intracellular function. We suggest that eukaryote-specific RACK1-uS3 interaction has evolved to act as a link between the ribosome and the cellular signaling pathways.

AB Therapeutic induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is one of the most promising approaches to ameliorate the severity of hemoglobinopathies like beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. Although several pharmacological agents have been investigated for HbF induction in adults, the majority of these are associated with significant side-effects. While drug repurposing is known to open new doors for the use of approved drugs in unexplored clinical conditions, the primary challenge lies in identifying such candidates. In this study, we aimed to identify repurposing candidates for HbF induction using a novel in silico approach utilizing microRNA-pathway-drug relationships. A computational drug repurposing strategy identified several unique candidates for HbF induction; among which Curcumin, Ginsenoside, Valproate, and Vorinostat were found to be most suitable for future trials. This study identified new drug repurposing candidates for HbF induction and demonstrates an easily adaptable methodology that can be used for other pathophysiological conditions.

AB Flammulina filiformis is an edible fungus that is largely cultivated and widely consumed around the world. The quantity and quality of the primordia, which gives rise to the fruiting body, affects its production efficiency. Hydrophobins are involved in the formation of the fruiting body of macrofungi. However, functional verification of the hydrophobin genes is limited to date. In this study, we used gene silencing and overexpression analyses to investigate the function of one F. filiformis hydrophobin gene (Hyd9) during the development of the fruiting body. The Hyd9-silenced transformants exhibited sparse aerial hyphae, resulting in fewer primordia and fruiting bodies. In contrast, the Hyd9 overexpression strain displayed denser aerial hyphae and more primordia. The phenotypes of these transgenic lines strongly suggested that Hyd9 plays an important role in the formation of aerial hyphal knots (the primary stage of primordia) and primordia in F. filiformis. These results will be beneficial for developing more efficient methods to induce primordia formation in F. filiformis and other commercially valuable mushrooms.

AB Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine disorder in reproductive-aged women. Clinical manifestations include hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation, polycystic ovaries and being frequently accompanied by insulin resistance (IR) and obesity. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs which are involved in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Altered miRNAs levels have been showed to be associated with a variety of diseases including diabetes, endometriosis and cancer. In recent years, more and more evidence suggests abnormal expression of miRNAs are detected in granulosa cells, theca cells, adipose tissue, follicular fluid, serum and peripheral blood leukocytes of women with PCOS and display vital role in the occurrence and development of PCOS. This will shed light on new strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of this syndrome. In this paper, we will review the recent research on miRNAs with respect to PCOS.

AB Micro RNA-34a-5p (miR-34a-5p) is an important molecule that can act as a modulator of tumor growth. It controls expression of a plenty of proteins controlling cell cycle, differentiation and apoptosis and opposing processes that favor viability of cancer cells, their metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that minichromosome maintenance protein 2 (MCM2) is a target gene of miR-34a-p. In this study, RT-qPCR was employed to detect the expression of miR-34a-5p and MCM2 in 10 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. The functional role of miR-34a-5p in HCC was investigated and the interaction between miR-34a-5p and MCM2 was explored. Results showed miR-34a-5p expression in HCC tissues was significantly lower than in non HCC liver tissues (P < 0.05), but MCM2 expression in HCC tissues was markedly higher than in non HCC liver tissues (P < 0.05). In addition, miR-34a-5p expression was negatively related to MCM2 expression. To confirm effect of miR-34a-5p on tumor growth and its possible effect on MCM2, miR-34a-5p mimic and inhibitor was transfected into HCC cell lines (HepG2). MTS assay, showed miR-34a-5p over-expression could inhibit the proliferation of HCC cells. RT-qPCR was done to detect the expression of miR-34a-5p and MCM2 in HepG2 cells before and after transfection. Results showed that MCM2 expression in HCC tissues was markedly lower in mimic transfected group than in inhibitor transfected group and control group (P < 0.05) while miR-34a-5p expression in HepG2 cells was significantly higher in mimic transfected group than in inhibitor transfected group and control group (P < 0.05). Thus, miR-34a-5p may inhibit the proliferation of HCC cells via regulating MCM2 expression. These findings provide an evidence for the emerging role of microRNAs as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets in HCC.

AB Biological significance of 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA; C18:3 n-6) and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA; C20:3 n-6) has gained much attention in the systematic development of optimized strains for industrial applications. In this work, a n-6 PUFAs-producing strain of Aspergillus oryzae was generated by manipulating metabolic reactions in fatty acid modification and triacylglycerol biosynthesis. The codon-optimized genes coding for Delta(6)-desaturase and Delta(6)-elongase of Pythium sp., and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (mMaDGAT2) of Mortierella alpina were co-transformed in a single vector into A. oryzae BCC14614, yielding strain TD6E6-DGAT2. Comparative phenotypic analysis showed that a 70% increase of lipid titer was found in the engineered strain, which was a result of a significant increase in triacylglycerol (TAG) content (52.0 +/- 1.8% of total lipids), and corresponded to the increased size of lipid particles observed in the fungal cells. Interestingly, the proportions of GLA and DGLA in neutral lipids of the engineered strain were similar, with the highest titers obtained in the high C:N culture (29:0; 6% glucose) during the lipid-accumulating stage of growth. Time-course expression analysis of the engineered strain revealed transcriptional control of TAG biosynthesis through a co-operation between the native DGAT2 of A. oryzae and the transformed mMaDGAT2.

AB Background: UGT2B7 was recently acknowledged as a new critical enzyme involved in biotransformation of a variety of carcinogens, whose function was reported to be significantly associated with its encoding gene (UGT2B7) polymorphisms. However, results regarding the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of UGT2B7 and cancer risk still remained controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted to further elucidate the role of UGT2B7 SNPs on cancer susceptibilities.
   Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Technology of Chongqing (VIP) and Wan Fang Database were searched for eligible studies until March 2019. All analysis was carried out using the Review Manager 5.3 software. Subgroup analyses were performed by cancer types, ethnicity or source of controls.
   Results: 13 studies with a total of 7688 cancer cases and 11,281 controls were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that UGT2B7 rs7439366 increased the colorectal cancer risk in dominant model (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.61-0.95, P = 0.02). However, as for the rs7435335 and rs 2233719, we did not find their associations with cancer risk in all genetic models. In addition, the rs7441774 was found to be associated with breast cancer risk and significantly reduced papillary thyroid cancer risk in rs3924194 was also observed. Nevertheless, these findings remained to be further proven in future studies since these 2 SNPs were only respectively involved in 1 study.
   Conclusion: This meta-analysis confirmed the association of UGT2B7 rs7439366 with colorectal cancer risk, which may be a potential promising biomarker for prediction of colorectal cancer risk.

AB In this study, we constructed a tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-alpha)-induced synovial cell inflammatory model using human synoviocytes (HS) cell line to explore the function of miR-98 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). miR-98 mimics or miR-98 inhibitor were transfected into HS cells to up-regulate or down-regulate the expression of miR-98. The proliferation and apoptosis of HS cells were determined using CCK8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. TargetScan website was utilized to predict the targets of miR-98. Luciferase assay was carried out to verify that IL-10 is a target of miR-98. Western blot was performed to analyze the expression of IL-10, apoptosis-related and NF-kappa B signaling pathway-related proteins. Our results demonstrated that the expression of miR-98 was upregulated in HS cells stimulated by TNF-alpha. Down-regulation of miR-98 by inhibitor in TNF-alpha-stimulated HS cells dramatically inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis compared with the miR-98 inhibitor NC group. The protein expression of Bcl-2 was declined while the levels of Bax and Bim were increased by miR-98 inhibitor in TNF-alpha-stimulated HS cells. IL-10 was predicted and verified as a target of miR-98. qRT-PCR and western blot results revealed that the level of IL-10 was negatively regulated by miR-98. Finally, we identified that down-regulation of miR-98 reduced the expression level of p-p65 and p-I kappa B alpha in TNF-alpha-stimulated HS cells. In summary, our present study demonstrated that down-regulation of miR-98 inhibited the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of TNF-alpha-stimulated HS partly by targeting IL-10 and regulating NF-kappa B signaling pathway, insinuating miR-98 as a candidate biomarker in RA.

AB The high mobility group A2 (HMGA2; also called HMGI-C) gene is an architectural transcription factor that belonging to the high mobility group AT-hook (HMGA) gene family. HMGA2 is aberrantly regulated in several human tumors. Over-expression of HMGA2 is correlated with a higher risk of metastasis and an unfavorable prognosis in patients with cancer. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the clinic-pathological and prognostic value of HMGA2 overexpression in different human tumors. A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, MEDLINE, Google Scholar and ISI Web of Science. Hazard ratios (HRs)/odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the association between HMGA2 expression and overall survival (OS)/progression free survival (PFS)/disease free survival (DFS). A total of 5319 patients with 19 different types of cancer from 35 articles were evaluated. Pooled data analysis indicated that increased HMGA2 expression in cancer patients predicted a poor OS (HR = 1.70; 95% CI = 1.6-1.81; P < 0.001; fixed-effect model). In subgroup analyses, high HMGA2 expression was particularly associated with poor OS in individuals with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer (HR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.83-1.96; fixed-effect model) and HNSCC cancer (HR-1.78, 95%CI: 1.44-2.21; fixed-effect model). Over-expression of HMGA2 was associated with vascular invasion (OR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.05-0.49; P = 0.001) and lymphatic invasion (OR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.06-3.38; P = 0.032). Further studies should be conducted to validate the prognostic value of HMGA2 for patients with GI cancers.

AB Background: Alternative splicing regulates most of protein-coding genes by producing diverse messenger RNA transcripts; and mis-splicing events can induce aberrant protein isoforms that contribute to cancer development. It is possible that genetic variations in splicing associated genes may regulate the formation of transcripts and multiple protein isoforms by affecting the splice regulatory elements. In this study, we aimed to determine whether genetic variations in the crucial alternative-splicing genes were associated with breast cancer risk.
   Materials and methods: A case-control study was conducted with 1064 breast cancer cases and 1073 healthy controls from China. A total of 16 tagging polymorphisms within three splicing factor-associated genes (SFRS3, ESRP1 and ESRP2) were genotyped by using Infinium BeadChip. The association between the polymorphisms and risk of breast cancer was evaluated by computing odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Results: The genotype distribution of rs2145048 in SFRS3 was different between cases and controls (Bonferroni corrected P = 0.022). After adjusting for age, age at menarche and menopausal status, the A allele of rs2145048 showed an inverse association with breast cancer risk in the additive model (adjusted OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.71-0.92, P = 0.001, Bonferroni corrected P = 0.016). In the stratification analysis, the association between rs2145048 A allele and breast cancer remained significant in subgroups of earlier menarche, older first bom, premenopausal status, and ER/PR negative status.
   Conclusions: This study provided the first evidence that SFRS3 rs2145048 was associated with breast cancer susceptibility in Chinese women, which might represent a biomarker to improve the identification of individuals at high risk of this malignancy.

AB Necrophagous Dermestes species have high forensic importance in relation to the estimation of elapsed time since death or death season. To further supplement the genome-level features for related species, the complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of Dermestes species D. essellatocollis, D. frischii and D. coarctatus are amplified, sequenced, annotated, analyzed, and compared with other twelve species of the infraorder Bostrichoidea. The mitochondrial genomes were typical circular molecules with 16,218, 15,873 and 15,873 bp in length, respectively. They included 13 protein coding genes, two rRNAs, and 22 tRNAs, as well as the putative control region. The gene orders and orientations are identical to those of other recorded bostrichiformian species and had the ancestral insect gene composition. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses based on all the mitochondrial protein coding genes for 13 Bostrichoidea and 16 outgroup taxa were performed using Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood analyses. The inferred trees indicate that the genus Dermestes is monophyletic. The monophyly of infraorder Bostrichiformia is not supported. This study provides genomic data for mitochondrial genome library of the genus Dermestes to investigate evolutionary and systematic studies.

AB Purpose: To evaluate the association of the presence, invasiveness, hormonal activity and recurrence of pituitary adenoma (PA) with ApoE genotypes and alleles.
   Materials and methods: Our study group included 142 patients with PA and the control group included 256 healthy individuals. The genotyping of ApoE (rs7412 and rs429358) was performed using a real-time PCR method.
   Results: After statistical analysis we found that ApoE genotype E2/E3 was associated with 2.6-fold increased odds of active PA (OR = 2.609; 95%Cl: 1.380-4.932; p = 0.003), while the presence of ApoE E3/E3 decreased odds of active PA by 65% (OR = 0.343; 95%CI: 0.205-0.575; p < 0.001). The frequency of the allele epsilon 3 was lesser in the PA group (74.3% vs. 83%, p = 0.003) when compared to controls but it was statistically significantly more frequent in the invasive PA than in the noninvasive PA subgroup (80.4% vs. 65.5%, p = 0.005). The ApoE E2/E4 genotype was more frequent in the noninvasive PA subgroup (10.3% vs. 0%, p = 0.003) than in the invasive PA subgroup. The ApoE E4/E4 genotype was more frequent in the recurrent than in the nonrecurrent PA subgroup (6.6% vs. 0%, p = 0.006). No associations between ApoE polymorphisms and Ki-67 labelling index were found.
   Conclusion: The ApoE E2/E3 genotype is associated with the presence of PA while the ApoE genotype E2/E4 is associated with noninvasive PA development. The allele epsilon 3 could possibly have a protective effect against PA. The genotype E4/E4 is associated with the development of recurrent PA.

AB In clinical genetics, the need to discriminate between benign and pathogenic variants identified in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders is an absolute necessity. Copy number variants (CNVs) of small size can enable the identification of genes that are critical for neurologic development. However, assigning a definite association with a specific disorder is a difficult task. Among 328 trios analyzed over seven years of activity in a single laboratory, we identified 19 unrelated patients (5.8%) who carried a small (< 500 kb) de novo CNV. Four patients had an additional independent de novo CNV. Nine had a variant that could be assigned as definitely pathogenic, whereas the remaining CNVs were considered as variants of unknown significance (VUS). We report clinical and molecular findings of patients harboring VUS. We reviewed the medical literature available for genes impacted by CNVs, obtained the probability of truncating loss-of-function intolerance, and compared overlapping CNVs reported in databases. The classification of small non-recurrent CNVs remains difficult but, among our findings, we provide support for a role of SNDI in the susceptibility of autism, describe a new case of the rare 17p13.1 microduplication syndrome, and report an X-linked duplication involving KIF4A and DLG3 as a likely cause of epilepsy.

AB Molecular mechanisms of aging and longevity are still mostly unknown. Mitochondria play central roles in cellular metabolism and aging. In this study, we identified three deletion mutants of mitochondrial metabolism genes (ppa2 Delta, dss1 Delta, and afg3 Delta) that live longer than wild-type cells. These long-lived cells harbored significantly decreased amount of mitochondria] DNA (mtDNA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Compared to the serpentine nature of wild-type mitochondria, a different dynamics and distribution pattern of mitochondria were observed in the mutants. Both young and old long-lived cells produced relatively low but adequate levels of ATP for cellular activities. The status of the retrograde signaling was checked by expression of CIT2 gene and found activated in long-lived mutants. The mutant cells were also profiled for their gene expression patterns, and genes that were differentially regulated were determined. All long-lived cells comprised similar pleiotropic phenotype regarding mitochondrial dynamics and functions. Thus, this study suggests that DSS1, PPA2, and AFG3 genes modulate the lifespan by altering the mitochondrial morphology and functions.

AB Systemic lupus erythematous (SEL) is a heterogeneous, systemic autoimmune disorder which is defined by its autoantibody pattern. Transcriptomic data analysis has shown pathways and immune system responses associated with SLE. Eight up-regulated genes (SOCE, MMP9, CXCL8, JUN, IL1B, NFKBIA, TNF and FOS) have been examined with four interactions among different pathways. These genes are associated with SNPs which have been identified through two datasets from SLE genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In this investigation, the GWAS results were integrated with pathway analysis of transcriptomes and several genes were detected with known SLE-related variations (TYK2, C5, SH2B, IRF5, IL2RA, STAT4, FCGR2A, IL7R, LYN, HLA-DRB and TNFAIP3). Pathway-based analysis on the Wikipathway Human Collection allowed the identification of prioritized variants in the relevant pathways, such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) signaling pathway linked to LYN, IL7R, STAT4 and rs7574865. Analysis of existing transcriptomes and GWAS data identified eight up-regulated candidate genes with more than four relationships among the different pathways associated with SNPs to pinpoint the relevant loci linked to SLE. The results of this investigation have expanded the number of candidate genes related to SLE and have highlighted possible pathways and GWAS-based methods for gene detection. Identification of the fundamental genes would assist in revealing the mechanisms responsible for SLE.

AB Due to the rapid development of DNA microarray technology, a large number of microarray data come into being and classifying these data has been verified useful for cancer diagnosis, treatment and prevention. However, microarray data classification is still a challenging task since there are often a huge number of genes but a small number of samples in gene expression data. As a result, a computational method for reducing the dimension of microarray data is necessary. In this paper, we introduce a computational gene selection model for microarray data classification via adaptive hypergraph embedded dictionary learning (AHEDL). Specifically, a dictionary is learned from the feature space of original high dimensional microarray data, and this learned dictionary is used to represent original genes with a reconstruction coefficient matrix. Then we use a l(2),(1)-norm regularization to impose the row sparsity on the coefficient matrix for selecting discriminate genes. Meanwhile, in order to capture the localmanifold geometrical structure of original microarray data in a high-order manner, a hypergraph is adaptively learned and embedded into the model. An iterative updating algorithm is designed for solving the optimization problem. In order to validate the efficacy of the proposed model, we have conducted experiments on six publicly available microarray data sets and the results demonstrate that AHEDL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of microarray data classification.

AB The functional sperm is the key factor for species continuation. The process spermatogenesis, to produce mature sperm is quite complex. It begins with the proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonia, which develop from primary spermatocytes to secondary spermatocytes and round spermatids, which eventually develop into fertile mature sperm. Spermiogenesis is the latest stage of spermatogenesis, where the round spermatids undergo a series of dramatic morphological changes and extreme condensation of chromatin to construct mature sperm with species-specific shape. During spermiogenesis, chromatin remodeling is a unique progress. It leads the nucleosome from a histone-based structure to a mostly protamine-based configuration. The main events of chromatin remodeling are the replacement of histone by histone variants, hyperacetylation, transient DNA strand breaks and repair, variants by transition proteins and finally by protamines. In this review, we synthesize and summarize the current knowledge on the progress of chromatin remodeling during spermiogenesis. We straighten out the chronological order of chromatin remodeling and illustrate the possible regulation mechanisms of each step.

AB Spermatogenesis is initiated when spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) in the mature testes enter mitosis and trigger differentiation. Thus, spermatogenesis and the ability to maintain a continuous source of spermatogonia relies on the ability to differentiate SSCs. Many studies around the world have been performed to investigate the etiology of male infertility and recent studies have focused on the presence and identification of biomarkers. CD133 and CD24 are stem cell markers locating in the testis and spermatogonia. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of the CD133 and CD24 genes with spermatogenesis defects and examine them as a candidate a useful biomarker for azoospermia men. The association of CD133 and CD24 with spermatogenesis defects was investigated in patients with obstructive (0) and non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). NOA cases were histopathologically classified into Hypospermatogenesis (HS), Maturation Arrest (MA), and Sertoli Cell Only Syndrome (SCO) groups. A qRT-PCR analysis of these genes was performed and protein expression levels were measured by Western blot analysis. CD133 expression in NOA group was found to be significantly different from OA and this was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemical assays.
   The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that gene expression of CD133 and CD24 had fold changes of 0.80 +/- 0.34 and 1.59 +/- 0.31 compared to controls, respectively in the HS group (p > 0.05) and 0.04 +/- 0.01 and 0.54 +/- 0.08 in the MA group (p < 0.05). In the SCO group, CD24 showed a 1.55 +/- 0.35-fold increase (p > 0.05). CD133 gene expression was not detected at the transcriptional level in the SCO group. Western blot analysis of CD133 protein expression revealed 1.83, 4.11, and 11.4-fold decreases in the HS, MA and SCO groups, respectively, compared to controls (p < 0.05). CD24 showed fold changes of 1.18, 0.38, (p < 0.05), and 0.89 in the HS, MA, and SCO groups, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis of CD133 revealed moderate, partial staining in the HS group, compared to substantial, wide-spread staining in the OA group. No staining was detected in either the MA or SCO groups. The localization of CD133 in healthy sperm was determined to be prominent in the tail and partly expressed in the head by confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis. It was also found that the expression of CD133 protein was high in healthy commercially-sourced Sertoli cells as well as in the Sertoli cells of OA individuals. Data from this study show that CD133 exhibits different profiles in infertile patient groups and thus may be considered as a candidate biomarker. CD24 can be associated with blockage of germ cell maturation in the MA group. Curative protocols for spermatogenesis defects may be possible with the use of these markers and thus their identification is extremely valuable in terms of human reproductive health.

AB In biogas plants, lignocellulose-rich biomass (LCB) is particularly slowly degraded, causing high hydraulic retention times. This fact lowers the interests for such substrates. To enhance LCB-degradation, cattle rumen fluid, a highly active microbial resource accruing in the growing meat industry, might be used as a potential source for bioaugmentation. This study compares 0%, 20% and 40% rumen liquid in a batch anaerobic digestion approach. Moreover, it determines the biogas- and methane-potentials as well as degradation-speeds of corn straw, co-digested with cattle manure. It inspects microbial communities via marker-gene sequencing, qPCR and RNA-DGGE and draws attention on possible beneficial effects of rumen addition on the biogas-producing community. Bioaugmentation with 20% and 40% v/v rumen liquid accelerated methane yields by 5 and 6 days, respectively (i.e. reaching 90% of total methane production). It also enhanced LCB- as well as (hemi) cellulose-and volatile fatty acid degradation. These results are supported by increased abundances of bacteria, methanogens and anaerobic fungi in treatments with rumen liquid amendment, and point towards the persistence of specific rumen-borne microorganisms especially during the first phase of the experiment. The results suggest that rumen liquid addition is a promising strategy for enhanced and accelerated exploitation of LCB for biomethanisation.

AB We aimed to evaluate the contribution of different factors in the Fetal Medicine Foundation algorithms for preeclampsia (PE) risk calculation during first-trimester screening in Hungary. We selected subjects for the nested case-control study from a prospective cohort of 2545 low-risk pregnancies. Eighty-two patients with PE and 82 gestational age-matched controls were included. Individual PE risk was calculated using two risk-assessing softwares. Using Astraia 2.3.1, considering maternal characteristics and biophysical parameters only, detection rates (DR) were 63.6% for early-PE and 67.6% for late-PE. When we added placenta associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) to the risk calculation, DRs decreased to 54.5% and 64.8% respectively. Using Astraia 2.8.2 with maternal characteristics and biophysical parameters resulted in the DRs of 63.6% (early-PE) and 56.3% (late-PE). If we added PAPP-A to the risk calculation, DRs improved to 72.7% and 54.9%. The addition of placental growth factor (PlGF) did not increase detection rates in either calculation. In conclusion, using maternal characteristics, biophysical parameters, and PAPP-A, an acceptable screening efficacy could be achieved for early-PE during first-trimester screening. Since PlGF did not improve efficacy in our study, we suggest setting new standard curves for PlGF in Eastern European pregnant women, and the evaluation of novel biochemical markers.

AB Increasing levels of antibiotic resistance in pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, remains a serious problem for public health, leading to the need for better alternative antimicrobial strategies. The antimicrobial proteins produced by Lactobacillus plantarum USM8613 attributed to its anti-staphylococcal activity were identified as extracellular transglycosylase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH), both with different mechanisms of action. Extracellular transglycosylase, which contains a LysM domain, exerts a cell wall-mediated killing mechanism, while GADPH penetrates into S. aureus cells and subsequently induces the overexpression of autolysis regulators, resulting in S. aureus autolysis. Both extracellular transglycosylase and GADPH exert anti-inflammatory effects in S. aureus-infected HaCaT cells by reducing the expression and production of TLR-2, hBDs and various pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-8). Taken together, extracellular transglycosylase and GADPH produced by L. plantarum USM8613 could potentially be applied as an alternative therapeutic agent to treat S. aureus skin infections and promote skin health.

AB Epidermis-specific promoters are necessary for ectopic expression of specific functional genes such as the cuticle-related genes. Previous studies indicated that both ECERIFERUM 6 (AtCER6) and MERISTEM L1 LAYER (ATML1) promoters from Arabidopsis thaliana can drive gene expression specifically in the epidermis of shoot apical meristems (SAMs) and leaves. However, the epidermis-specific promoters from legume plants have not been reported. Here, we cloned a 5' flanking sequence from the upstream -2150 bp to the translational start ATG codon of MtML1 gene of legume model plant Medicago truncatula. PlantCARE analysis indicated that this sequence matches the characteristics of a promoter, having TATA box and CAAT box, as well as contains some conserved elements of epidermis-specific promoters like AtCER6 and ATML1 promoters. The beta-glucuronidase (GUS) histochemical analysis showed that MtML1 promoter can drive GUS gene expression in transiently transformed Nicotiana tabacum leaves under non-inducing condition. Furthermore, it can also control GUS expression in leaves and siliques rather than roots of the stably transformed Arabidopsis. More importantly, the leaf cross-section observations indicated that MtML1 exclusively expressed in the epidermis of leaves. These results suggested that MtML1 promoter performed the epidermis-specific in plant shoot. Our study establishes the foundation for driving the cuticle-related gene to express in epidermis, which may be very useful in genetic engineering of legume plants.

AB Recombinant proteins produced by mammalian cell culture technology represent an important segment of therapeutic molecules. Development of their manufacturing processes is a time- and resource-consuming task. A wide array of process conditions, e.g. physico-chemical parameters, medium composition, feeding strategy, needs to be optimized to design a commercially feasible process with the desired productivity and product characteristics. Traditionally, statistical experimental designs, i.e. design-of-experiments methodology, have been used for such optimizations. However, statistical design approach has several limitations related to high dimensionality of the explored parameter space originating from the complexity of the mammalian cell culture processes. An alternative is therefore desired to overcome these limitations. In this study, we have successfully used a simple genetic algorithm as a method of experimental design for optimization of mammalian cell culture processes for two recombinant cell lines, one expressing a monoclonal antibody and one an Fc-fusion protein. Harnessing the automation capability of a robotically driven micro-bioreactor system to execute the genetic algorithm-derived experiments, a set of 14 process parameters was optimized within 132 experiments per cell line (six generations of 22 experiments), showing the feasibility of this approach as an alternative to classical statistical experimental designs.

AB D-danshensu (D-DSS), extracted from the plant Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen), is widely used to treat cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Here we engineered Escherichia coli strains to produce D-DSS from catechol, pyruvate and ammonia by one-pot biotransformation. Tyrosin-phenol lyase (TPL), L-amino acid deaminase (aadL), D-lactate dehydrogenase (ldhD) and glucose dehydrogenase (gdh) genes were overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain. First, the expression of genes was regulated by different copy number plasmids combination, the result of E. coli TALG6, with strong overexpression of TPL, aadL, ldhD and moderate overexpression of gdh, exhibited 253.7% increase D-DSS production compared to E. coli TALG1. Second, the optimum concentration of catechol was found to be 50 mM. Finally, a fed-batch biotransformation strategy was proposed, namely the amount of catechol was added to 50mM every 2 h. The total production of D-DSS reached 55.35mM within 14 h, which was 1.7 times that without feeding.

AB 6-(N-hydroxyethyl) amino-6-deoxy-L-sorbofuranose (6NSL) is the direct precursor of miglitol for diabetes therapy. The regio-and stereo-selective dehydrogenation offered by the membrane-bound D-sorbitol dehydrogenase (mSLDH) from Gluconobacter oxydans provides an elegant enzymatic method for 6NSL production. In this study, two subunits sldA and sldB of mSLDH were introduced into G. oxydans ZJB-605, and the specific enzyme activity of mSLDH towards NHEG was enhanced by 2.15-fold. However, the endogenous PQQ level was dramatically reduced in the recombinant strain and became a bottleneck to support the holo-enzyme activity. A combined supplementation of four amino acids (Glu, Ile, Ser, Arg) involved in biosynthesis of PQQ in conventional media effectively increased extracellular accumulation of PQQ by 1.49-fold, which further enhanced mSLDH activity by 1.33-fold. The synergic improvement of mSLDH activity provided in this study supports the superior high dehydrogenate activity towards substrate N-2-hydroxyethyl-glucamine, 184.28 g.L-1 of 6NSL was produced after a repeated bioconversion process catalyzed by the resting cells of G. oxydans/pBB-sldAB, all of which presenting a great potential of their industrial application in 6NSL biosynthesis.

AB While chromatin immunoprecipitation has become a widely-used method in the field of transcription regulation studies, serious limitations connected to the complexity and relatively little standardization of the method serve as obstacles for its use in clinical research. In this paper we introduce a method for developing bacteriophage-based controls for the better standardization of the chromatin immunoprecipitation reactions. Random phage display libraries were selected with ChIP-grade antibodies for several rounds and individual monoclonal phages were isolated. These monoclonal phages can be propagated, characterized, capillary sequenced and if needed later cloned from in-silico data. Using such control tools allows for a better characterization of the immunoprecipitation stage needed for further clinical research in the field of chromatin-immunoprecipitation-based studies.

AB Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) for gene therapy applications are gaining momentum, with more therapies moving into later stages of clinical development and towards market approval, namely for cancer therapy. The development of cytotoxic vectors is often hampered by side effects arising when non-target cells are infected, and their production can be hindered by toxic effects of the transgene on the producing cell lines. In this study, we evaluated the potential of rAAV-mediated delivery of short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) to target basal-like breast cancer genetic vulnerabilities. Our results show that by optimizing the stoichiometry of the plasmids upon transfection and time of harvest, it is possible to increase the viral titers and quality. All rAAV-shRNA vectors obtained efficiently transduced the BLBC cell lines MDA-MB-468 and HCC1954. In MDA-MB-468, transduction with rAAV-shRNA vector targeting PSMA2 was associated with significant decrease in cell viability and apoptosis induction. Importantly, rAAV2-PSMA2 also slowed tumor growth in a BLBC mouse xenograft model, thus potentially representing a therapeutic strategy against this type of cancer.

AB Efforts to use genetically modified cells to detect inorganic ions and organic molecules have been hindered by biosafety concerns, limitation of cell membrane barriers, cytotoxicity problems, and unfriendly operations. To address those challenges, cell-free biosensing systems were established to detect arsenic, mercury, acyl-homoserine lactone, and benzoic acid in this study. The cell-free system mimics biological transcription and translation activities in an open environment without living cells. The most bioactive cell-free system was obtained by screening different Escherichia coli strain extracts and Mg2+ concentrations. It was found that the sensitivity of cell-free systems could reach nanomolar levels with the short response time. The selectivity experiments showed that cell-free biosensing of inorganic ions had no signal interference. Cell-free biosensing systems, with their wide range of molecule detection, short response time and high specificity, could potentially serve as powerful biosensing platforms for environmental and medical applications.

AB Use of plasma cell-free DNA genomic testing, also know as liquid biopsy, reveals information for early detection and monitoring of solid tumors. Our study reports the analysis of 113 lung and 18 breast cancer patients using commercially available platforms. Lung and breast cancer panel hotspot regions on the genes were investigated. There was a significant increase in isolation efficiency with very fresh blood samples of at least 15 millilitres which were processed in minutes. TP53 gene variations were detected in both types of tumors. Additionally, associations were found for EGFR variations in lung tumors and PIK3CA variations in breast tumors. Mutation assessment of these three genes are recommended as useful biomarkers for predictive studies, to follow up tumor growth and for personalized treatment. Mutations observed in this study warrant further investigation for follow up studies and may justify expression studies. However, in our subsequent studies, we intensify our tumor profiling strategy with other methods. However in terms of true personalized medicine, future plans would include repeating these studies with ctDNA size analysis and methylation analysis of the non-coding region in the individual tumors.

AB Influenza A virus (IAV) vaccines in pigs generally provide homosubtypic protection but fail to prevent heterologous infections. In this pilot study, the efficacy of an intradermal pDNA vaccine composed of conserved SLA class I and class H T cell epitopes (EPITOPE) against a homosubtypic challenge was compared to an intramuscular commercial inactivated whole virus vaccine (INACT) and a heterologous prime boost approach using both vaccines. Thirty-nine IAV-free, 3-week-old pigs were randomly assigned to one of five groups including NEG-CONTROL (unvaccinated, sham-challenged), INACT-INACT-IAV (vaccinated with FluSure XP (R) at 4 and 7 weeks, pH] N1 challenged), EPITOPE-INACT-IAV (vaccinated with PigMatrix EDV at 4 and FluSure XP (R) at 7 weeks, pH1N1 challenged), EPITOPE-EPITOPE-IAV (vaccinated with PigMatrix EDV at 4 and 7 weeks, pH1N1 challenged), and a POS-CONTROL group (unvaccinated, pH1N1 challenged). The challenge was done at 9 weeks of age and pigs were necropsied at day post challenge (dpc) 5. At the time of challenge, all INACT-INACT-IAV pigs, and by dpc 5 all EPITOPE-INACT-IAV pigs were IAV seropositive. IFN gamma secreting cells, recognizing vaccine epitope-specific peptides and pH1N1 challenge virus were highest in the EPITOPE-INACT-IAV pigs at challenge. Macroscopic lung lesion scores were reduced in all EPITOPE-INACT-IAV pigs while INACT-INACT-IAV pigs exhibited a bimodal distribution of low and high scores akin to na ve challenged animals. No IAV antigen in lung tissues was detected at necropsy in the EPITOPE-INACT-IAV group, which was similar to na ve unchallenged pigs and different from all other challenged groups. Results suggest that the heterologous prime boost approach using an epitope-driven DNA vaccine followed by an inactivated vaccine was effective against a homosubtypic challenge, and further exploration of this vaccine approach as a practical control measure against heterosubtypic IAV infections is warranted.

AB Background: Linking data on laboratory specimens collected during clinical practice with health administrative data permits highly powered vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies to be conducted at relatively low cost, but bias from using convenience samples is a concern. We evaluated the validity of using such data for estimating VE.
   Methods: We created the Flu and Other Respiratory Viruses Research (FOREVER) Cohort by linking individual-level data on respiratory virus laboratory tests, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and physician services. For community-dwelling adults aged > 65 years, we assessed the presence and magnitude of information and selection biases, generated VE estimates under various conditions, and compared our VE estimates with those from other studies.
   Results: We included 65,648 unique testing episodes obtained from 54,434 individuals during the 2010-11 to 2015-16 influenza seasons. To examine information bias, we found the proportion testing positive for influenza for patients with unknown interval from illness onset to specimen collection was more similar to patients for whom illness onset date was < 7 days before specimen collection than to patients for whom illness onset was > 7 days before specimen collection. To assess the presence of selection bias, we found the likelihood of influenza testing was comparable between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, although the adjusted odds ratios were significantly greater than 1 for some healthcare settings and during some influenza seasons. Over 6 seasons, VE estimates ranged between 36% (95%Cl, 27-44%) in 2010-11 and 5% (95%Cl,-2, 11%) in 2014-15. VE estimates were similar under a range of conditions, but were consistently higher when accounting for misclassification of vaccination status through a quantitative sensitivity analysis. VE estimates from the FOREVER Cohort were comparable to those from other studies.
   Conclusions: Routinely collected laboratory and health administrative data contained in the FOREVER Cohort can be used to estimate influenza VE in community-dwelling older adults. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID PAPILLOMAVIRUS; INITIATION; RATES
AB Background: HPV vaccine is effective in preventing several cancers and anogenital warts, yet rates of HPV vaccination series completion in the United States are low. A primary reason identified by parents for vaccinating children against HPV is a health care provider's recommendation. Although most clinicians embrace vaccine recommendations, they are not always carried out evenly and subsequent HPV vaccines are missed.
   Methods: Using an electronic health records-based decision support system (CHICA) clinicians were randomized to either usual practice or to receive an automated reminder to recommend the 2nd or 3rd dose of HPV vaccine. The reminder was delivered to clinicians of all intervention group eligible adolescents who had already initiated the vaccine series. Logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations were used for data analysis.
   Results: A total of 1285 clinical encounters were observed across 29 randomized pediatric providers over a 13-month time frame (50.7% control group, 49.3% intervention group). Overall, patients were 44.9% female, 59.4% Black, 22.1% Hispanic, and 48.8% were ages 11-12 yrs. Within the control group, 421 (64.7%) received a subsequent HPV vaccine, compared to 481 (75.9%) (OR: 1.72, (95% CI 1.35-2.19)). Adjusted analysis showed no difference between the groups (aOR 1.52 (95% CI 0.88-2.62)) or when examined by age (11-12yrs aOR 1.66, (95% CI 0.79-3.48)) and 13-17yrs (aOR 1.19, (95% CI 0.76-1.85)) or gender female (aOR 1.39 (95% CI 0.71-2.72)) and males (aOR 1.67 (95% CI 0.95-2.92)). When results were stratified by both age and gender, there was similarly no statistically significant effect between the two groups.
   Conclusions: Automated physician reminders for subsequent 2nd and 3rd doses of HPV vaccination were used. Despite increased rates of vaccination in the intervention group, the differences did not reach the level of statistical significance.

AB In the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec, 83% of the population <= 20 years (n congruent to 59,500) was immunized in 2014 with the four-component Serogroup B meningococcal vaccine to control a long-lasting outbreak caused by a virulent ST-269 Serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis clone. Following the campaign, invasive meningococcal B disease (B-IMD) incidence fell sharply in the target population from 11.4/100,000 in 2006-2014 to 0.4/100,000 in 2014-2018 (p < 0.0001). Five B-IMD cases occurred in the region from July 2014 to June 2018, including one vaccinated child, one unvaccinated young adult and 3 unvaccinated elderly adults. Estimate of direct vaccine protection was 79% [95%CI:-231%;99%]. The overall campaign impact in the region taking into account the decrease in B-IMD incidence at provincial level was a 86% [95%CI:-2%;98%] decrease in B-IMD risk. The campaign impact was mostly seen in the target age-group suggesting no herd effect among unvaccinated older adults. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Although oil-in-water adjuvants improve pandemic influenza vaccine efficacy, AS03 versus MF59 adjuvant comparisons in A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic vaccines are lacking.
   Methods: We conducted an indirect-comparison meta-analysis extracting published data from randomised controlled trials in literature databases (01/01/2009-09/09/2018), evaluating immunogenicity and safety of AS03- or MF59-adjuvanted vaccines. We conducted comparisons of log-transformed haemagglutination inhibition geometric mean titre ratio (GMTR; primary outcome) of different regimens of each adjuvant versus unadjuvanted counterparts. Then via test of subgroup differences, we indirectly compared different AS03 versus MF59 regimens.
   Results: We identified 22 publications with 10,734 participants. In adults, AS03-adjuvanted vaccines (3.75 mu g haemagglutinin) achieved superior GMTR versus unadjuvanted vaccines (all four comparisons); MD = 0.56 (95%CI 0.33 to 0.80, p < 0.001) to 1.18 (95%CI 0.72 to 1.65, p < 0.001). MF59 (full-dose)-adjuvanted vaccines (7.5 mu g haemagglutinin) were superior to unadjuvanted vaccines (three of four comparisons); MD = 0.47 (95%CI 0.19 to 0.75, p = 0.001) to 0.80 (95%CI 0.44 to 1.16, p < 0.001). Adult indirect comparisons favoured AS03 over MF59 (six of eight comparisons; p < 0.001 to p = 0.088).
   Paediatric indirect comparisons favoured MF59-adjuvanted vaccines (two of seven comparisons; p = 0.011, 0.079). However, unadjuvanted control group seroconversion rate was lower in MF59 than AS03 studies (p < 0.001 to p = 0.097).
   There was substantial heterogeneity, and adult AS03 studies had lower risk of bias.
   Conclusions: Despite limited studies, in adults, AS03-adjuvanted vaccines allow antigen sparing versus MF59-adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccines, with similar immunogenicity, but higher risk of pain and fatigue (secondary outcomes) than unadjuvanted vaccines. In children, adjuvanted vaccines are also superior, but the better adjuvant is uncertain. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In 2016, the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed Vaxchora (R) for active immunization against disease caused by Vibrio cholerae serogroup 01 in adults. Vaxchora was the first US-licensed vaccine for which the primary evidence supporting effectiveness was derived from human challenge studies. Following this precedent, FDA has received numerous inquiries from manufacturers, academic researchers, funders and other stakeholders regarding how controlled human infection models (CHIMs) can be used to support the development of safe and effective vaccines to address public health needs. The aims of this article are to discuss: (1) Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) for challenge inocula, (2) conduct of controlled human infection studies under US IND and (3) use of CHIMs to support vaccine development. General concepts and regulatory considerations for the safe conduct of CHIMs and use of CHIMs to evaluate vaccine effectiveness are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Missed Opportunities for HPV Vaccination Among Vaccine-Eligible Women

DE Vaccination; Human papillomavirus; Barriers; Vaccine eligibility
ID UNITED-STATES; PAPILLOMAVIRUS; COMMUNICATION
AB Background: Incidence of high-grade cervical lesions (HGCL) has declined in the U.S following the introduction of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in 2006. However, many women continue to be diagnosed with HGCLs, including those eligible to receive the vaccine but did not. We determined self-reported barriers to and correlates of HPV vaccination in vaccine-eligible women diagnosed with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2, 2/3, 3 and adenocarcinoma in situ (CIN2+).
   Methods: Data from a statewide surveillance system in Connecticut for CIN2+ during 2008-2015 were used for this analysis. Enhanced surveillance data were collected for women residing in New Haven County, including HPV vaccine history and demographic factors, through chart review and patient interviews. Women who reported being unvaccinated were asked why they did not receive the vaccine. We evaluated trends in reasons for not receiving the vaccine using a two-sided Cochran Armitage trend test. Log-binomial analysis was used to assess associations between sociodemographic characteristics and vaccination status.
   Results: Between 2008 and 2015, 1625 vaccine-eligible women were diagnosed with CIN2+, with 882 of these women reporting never receiving the HPV vaccine. The proportion of unvaccinated vaccine-eligible women did not significantly change from 2008 to 2015 (p = 0.18, range 49.1% to 60.0%). The most commonly reported reason for being unvaccinated was age/too old, followed by previous HPV diagnosis and no provider recommendation. Women who had public or no insurance were significantly more likely than privately insured women to report being unvaccinated (p = <0.001, p = 0.0034).
   Conclusions: Commonly cited barriers to vaccination, such as age/too old and previous HPV diagnosis, are not contraindications for vaccination. Furthermore, frequent reporting of no provider recommendation underscores the important role providers play in the immunization of their patients. These results indicate the need for greater efforts by providers to dispel myths about HPV vaccine eligibility and to promote vaccination for all of their eligible patients. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objectives: To assess influenza immunisation rates and coverage in adult patients from Australian general practice and identify whether practice or patients' characteristics are associated with vaccination uptake.
   Design: Open cohort study.
   Setting: 550 Australian general practices included in the MedicineInsight database.
   Participants: Patients aged 18+ years who had at least one consultation during influenza season between 2015 and 2017. Two samples were considered: (1) 'active' patients (at least three consultations in any two consecutive years) and (2) 'every year' patients (at least one consultation per year).
   Main outcome measures: Influenza vaccination rates per 1,000 consultations and coverage (% vaccinated among those who consulted) from 2015 to 2017.
   Results: Between 2015 and 2017 the influenza vaccine rate changed from 57.4 to 51.7 and 67.0 per 1,000 consultations, while correspondent values for coverage were 29.3%, 25.2% and 27.6% (in 'active' patients). Vaccine coverage was at least 30% higher in inner regional areas, among patients aged 65+ years or those with comorbidities. Similar associations were found among 'every year' patients, but average coverage across the three years was higher (41% vs 27%). Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, either with or without comorbidity, showed a vaccine coverage 10-30% higher than non-Indigenous people for those aged less than 65 years (p-value for interaction < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Medicinelnsight data is a useful and low-cost method to monitor influenza immunisation coverage. Independent of the sample used, vaccination coverage among Indigenous people or patients with comorbidities could be improved. Targeted strategies for high-risk groups need to be developed.

AB Background: Poliomyelitis infection continues to be endemic in few countries despite rigorous efforts for eradication. A new Bivalent Oral Polio Vaccine (BBio bOPV) was tested in a Phase Ill Clinical study.
   Methods: An observer blind, randomized, controlled clinical study was conducted comparing BBio bOPV with a licensed bOPV (511 bOPV). Initially in Part 1, 40 children 5-6 years of age were given a single dose of either vaccine in 1:1 ratio. In Part 2, 1080 infants of 6-8 weeks of age were received in 1:1:1:1 ratio one of the 3 lots of BBio bOPV or SII bOPV at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age. Blood samples were collected to assess neutralizing antibody responses against Polio Type 1 and 3 viruses. Safety of the vaccines were recorded.
   Results: All children were seroprotected against both Type 1 and Type 3 polioviruses post-vaccination. More than 96% of the infants demonstrated seroconversion as well as seroprotection against both types of polioviruses. The geometric mean titres (GMT) for Type 1 and Type 3 antibodies were comparable between the groups. The 3 lots of BBio bOPV generated similar GMTs of Type 1 and Type 3 antibodies. In total 387 participants reported at least one adverse event and 18 serious adverse events. None of these events were vaccine related.
   Conclusions: The new bOPV vaccine demonstrated immunogenicity that was non-inferior to a licensed bOPV vaccine. Consistency in immune response by 3 consecutively manufactured lots was also demonstrated. The vaccine did not cause any adverse event. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID IMMUNIZATION
AB Introduction: Since its independence in 2002, Timor Leste has made significant strides in improving childhood vaccination coverage. However, coverage is still below national targets, and children continue to have missed opportunities for vaccination (MOV), when eligible children have contact with the health system but are not vaccinated. Timor Leste implemented the updated World Health Organization methodology for assessing MOV in 2016.
   Methods: The MOV data collection included quantitative (caregiver exit interviews and health worker knowledge, attitudes, practices surveys (KAP)) and qualitative arms (focus group discussions (FGDs) with caregivers and health workers and in-depth interviews (IDIs) with health administrators). During a four-day period, health workers and caregivers with children <24 months of age attending the selected eight facilities in Dili Municipality were invited to participate. The researchers calculated the proportion of MOV and timeliness of vaccine doses among children with documented vaccination histories (i.e., from a home-based record or facility register) and thematically analyzed the qualitative data.
   Results: Researchers conducted 365 caregiver exit interviews, 169 health worker KAP surveys, 4 FGDs with caregivers, 2 FGDs with health workers, and 2 IDIs with health administrators. Among eligible children with documented vaccination histories (n = 199), 41% missed an opportunity for vaccination. One-third of health workers (33%) believed their knowledge of immunization practices to be insufficient. Qualitative results showed vaccines were not available at all selected health facilities, and some facilities reported problems with their cold chain equipment.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates that many children in Timor Leste miss opportunities for vaccination during health service encounters. Potential interventions to reduce MOV include training of health workers, improving availability of vaccines at more health facilities, and replacing unusable cold chain equipment. Timor Leste should continue to scale up successful MOV interventions beyond Dili Municipality to improve vaccination coverage nationally and strengthen the health system overall.

AB Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are a group of genetically diverse and economically important zoonotic pathogens. Despite decades of research, effective and broadly protective vaccines are yet to be developed. Recent breakthroughs in epitope-based immunization for influenza viruses identify certain conserved regions of the HA2 and M2e proteins as capable of inducing broad protection against multiple influenza strains. The M2e and HA2 peptides have been evaluated in mice but not as a combination in pigs, which play an important role in the transmission and evolution of IAV. Peptides are inherently weak immunogens; and effective delivery of peptide antigens is challenging. To enhance the delivery and immunogenicity of peptide-based vaccines, the conserved M2e and HA2 and a strain-specific HAl epitope of Influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 were expressed as a chain in a bacterial expression system and entrapped in a novel amphiphilic invertible polymer made from polyethyelene glycol (PEG, molecular weight 600 g/mol) and polytetrahydrofuran (PTHF, molecular weight 650 g/mol), PEG600PTHF650. Piglets vaccinated with polymeric peptide vaccine mounted significantly stronger antibody responses against the peptide construct when compared to piglets immunized with the multi-epitope peptide alone. When vaccinated pigs were challenged with Influenza A (H1N1) pdm09, viral shedding in nasal secretions and lung lesion scores were significantly reduced when compared to the unvaccinated controls and pigs vaccinated with the peptide alone at six days post-challenge. Thus, the combination of the PEG(600)PTHF(650) polymer and trimeric peptide construct enhanced delivery of the peptide antigen, acted as an adjuvant in stimulating strong antibody responses, reduced the effects of viral infection in vaccinated pigs.

AB ONRAB (R) is a human adenovirus rabies glycoprotein recombinant vaccine developed to control rabies in wildlife. To support licensing and widespread use of the vaccine, safety studies are needed to assess its potential residual impact on wildlife populations. We examined the persistence of the ONRAB (R) vaccine virus in captive rabies vector and non-target mammals. This research complements work on important rabies vector species (raccoon, striped skunk, and red fox) but also adds to previous findings with the addition of some non-target species (Virginia opossum, Norway rats, and cotton rats) and a prolonged period of post vaccination monitoring (41 days). Animals were directly inoculated orally with the vaccine and vaccine shedding was monitored using quantitative real-time PCR applied to oral and rectal swabs. ONRAB (R) DNA was detected in both oral and rectal swabs from 6 h to 3 days post-inoculation in most animals, followed by a resurgence of shedding between days 17 and 34 in some species. Overall, the duration over which ONRAB (R) DNA was detectable was shorter for non-target mammals, and by day 41, no animal had detectable DNA in either oral or rectal swabs. All target species, as well as cotton rats and laboratory-bred Norway rats, developed robust humoral immune responses as measured by competitive ELISA, with all individuals being seropositive at day 31. Similarly, opossums showed good response (89% seropositive; 8/9), whereas only one of nine wild caught Norway rats was seropositive at day 31. These results support findings of other safety studies suggesting that ONRAB (R) does not persist in vector and non-target mammals exposed to the vaccine. As such, we interpret these data to reflect a low risk of adverse effects to wild populations following distribution of ONRAB (R) to control sylvatic rabies.

AB Modified live virus (MLV) vaccines are commonly used to reduce the impact of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) but limited efficacy is achieved in field conditions. Here, we evaluated the impact of maternally-derived neutralizing antibodies (MDNAs) on vaccine efficacy after PRRS virus (PRRSV) challenge. Piglets with low (A-) or high (A+) MDNA levels derived from a commercial pig herd were moved to experimental facilities to be vaccinated (V+) or not (V-) with a PRRSV-1 MLV vaccine at 3 weeks of age (woa). Because of unexpectedly low vaccine detection in A-V+ piglets post-vaccination (pv), all V+ piglets received a second vaccination at 4 woa. Five weeks (W5) pv, piglets were inoculated with a PRRSV-1 field strain to evaluate vaccine protection, and were mingled 24 h later with non-inoculated piglets of similar immune status to assess viral transmission. Vaccine strain was detected at W2 pv in 69% and 6% of A-V+ and A+V+ piglets, and at W5 pv in 50% and 25% of A-V+ and A+V+ piglets, respectively. At W5 pv, 94% of A-V+ and 44% of A+V+ piglets seroconverted, with a significant IFNg response induction in the A-V+ group only. After challenge, compared to the V- inoculated group, viremia was 100-fold lower at 10 days post-infection in A-V+ whereas viremia was not significantly reduced in A+V+ piglets. A lower transmission rate was estimated for the A-V+ group: 0.15 [0.07-0.29] versus 0.44 [0.18-1.76] and 0.32 [0.14-0.68] for the A+V+ and V- groups, respectively. Investigations about the low vaccine strain detection after the first vaccination suggested a relationship between IFNa levels and vaccine strain detection in A-V+ piglets. We showed that MDNAs impair vaccine efficacy against PRRSV both in inoculated and contact piglets, probably by reducing vaccine replication. IFNa may also interfere with PRRSV vaccination. These new data could help improving vaccination protocols. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a major component of the cell wall of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), is not generally considered as an ideal vaccine candidate since it is a thymus-independent antigen. In this study, we screened a 12-mer phage peptide library and identified a series of peptide sequences that can mimic the epitope of LTA. A tetra-branched multiple antigenic peptide, named MAP2-3, comprising one of the positive peptide sequences (GHKEDRQWCQHS), was synthesized. Immunization with MAP2-3 induced LTA-specific IgG antibodies, prolonged the survival time, and decreased the bacterial burden in organs of mice infected with S. aureus. Moreover, passive immunization with polyclonal anti-MAP2-3 sera reduced bacterial load in organs of mice with bacteremia, alleviated acute lung injury in mice with pneumonia, and decreased the size of lesions in mice with skin infection. The number of LTA-specific antibody-secreting cells in the spleen of MAP2-3 immunized mice were significantly higher than that in the control mice. In summary, as a surrogate of LTA, vaccination with MAP2-3 elicited humoral immune response and protected mice from S. aureus infection. This study provides a new option to design vaccines against S. aureus. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To estimate the associations between measles vaccination and child anthropometry, cognition, and schooling outcomes in Ethiopia, India, and Vietnam.
   Methods: Longitudinal survey data from Young Lives were used to compare outcomes at ages 7-8 and 11-12 years between children who reported receipt or non-receipt of measles vaccine at 6-18 months-of-life (n = similar to 2000/country). Z-scores of height-for-age (HAZ), BMI-for-age (BMIZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), early grade reading assessment (EGRA), language and mathematics tests, and attained schooling grade were examined. Propensity score matching was used to control for systematic differences between measles-vaccinated and measles-unvaccinated children.
   Findings: Using age- and country-matched measles-unvaccinated children as comparisons, measles-vaccinated children had better anthropometrics, cognition, and schooling. Measles-vaccinated children had 0.1 higher HAZ in India and 0.2 higher BMIZ and WAZ in Vietnam at age 7-8 years, and 0.2 higher BMIZ at age 11-12 years in Vietnam. At ages 7-8 years, they scored 4.5 and 2.9 percentage points (pp) more on PPVF and mathematics, and 2.3 points more on EGRA in Ethiopia, 2.5 points more on EGRA in India, and 2.6 pp, 4 pp, and 2.7 points more respectively on PPVT, mathematics, and EGRA in Vietnam. At ages 11-12 years, they scored 3 pp more on English and PPVT in India, and 1.7 pp more on PPVT in Vietnam. They also attained 0.2-0.3 additional schooling grades across all ages and countries.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that measles vaccination may have benefits on cognitive gains and school-grade attainment that can have broad educational and economic consequences which extend beyond early childhood. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), especially that caused by enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection, is a public health concern in the Asia-Pacific region. We report a phase I clinical trial of an EV71 candidate vaccine (INV21) based on a binary ethylenimine inactivated B2 sub-genotype formulated with aluminum hydroxide.
   Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, dose escalation study adult volunteers received two vaccinations 28 days apart of low or high dose formulations of the candidate vaccine and were then monitored for safety and reactogenicity for four weeks after each dose, and for their immune responses up to 28 weeks.
   Results: Of 36 adults enrolled, 35 completed the study as planned. Either no or mild adverse events were observed, mainly injection site pain and tiredness. Seroconversion was 100% after two vaccinations. High geometric mean neutralizing antibody titers (GMT) were observed 14 days post first dose, peaking 14 days post second dose (at Day 42) in both high and low dose groups; GMTs on days 14, 28, 42, and 56 were 128, 81, 323, 203 and 144, 100, 451, 351 in low-and high-dose groups, respectively. Titers for both doses declined gradually to Day 196 but remained higher than baseline and the placebo groups, which had low GMTs throughout the duration of the study. Cross-neutralizing antibody activity against heterologous sub-genotypes was demonstrated.
   Conclusion: These data show that the EV71 candidate vaccine is safe and immunogenic in adults and supports further clinical development as a potential pediatric vaccine by initiating a dose-escalation study for determining the dose-dependent safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in young naive children.

AB Previously, a heartwater experimental DNA vaccine provided 100% protection following laboratory challenge with Ehrlichia ruminantium administered by needle but not against an E. ruminantium tick challenge in the field. A multi-epitope DNA vaccine incorporating both CD4(+) and CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes epitopes could provide a better alternative. In this study, we investigated the use of multi-epitope DNA vaccines against an E. ruminantium experimental tick challenge in sheep. The multi-epitope DNA vaccines were delivered via the intramuscular route and intradermal route using the gene gun in the presence of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) adjuvant, which was either applied topically to the gene gun inoculation site or co-administered with the vaccine via the intramuscular route. Initially two constructs namely, pSignal plus and pLamp were tested with MPL applied topically only and no protection was obtained in this formulation. However, when pLamp was co-administered with MPL via the intramuscular route in addition to topical application, its protective efficiency improved to protect 60% of the sheep against tick challenge. In this formulation, the vaccine induced enhanced activation of memory T cell responses both before and after challenge with variations amongst the different sheep possibly due to their different genetic backgrounds. In conclusion, this study showed that a heartwater multi-epitope DNA vaccine, co-administered with MPL adjuvant can protect sheep following a laboratory E. ruminantium tick challenge.

AB Duck hepatitis A virus (DHAV) is the major pathogen of duck viral hepatitis, which has caused great economic losses to duck breeding industry. As an effective delivery tool for protein antigens, Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) has been successfully used to stimulate mucosal and systemic immune response. In this study, a recombinant L lactis named NZ3900-VP1 was constructed, which could express VP1 protein of DHAV type 3 (DHAV-3) by using a nisin-controlled expression (NICE) system. The animal experiment in both mice and ducklings were performed to detect the immune response and protection effect of oral vaccination by the recombinant L lactis. The results showed that oral vaccination with L. lactis NZ3900-VP1 significantly induced specific anti-VP1 IgG antibodies and mucosal secretory immunoglobulin A (slgA) of DHAV-3 in mice and ducklings, and cytokines including interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-4 (IL-4). Notably, the ducklings vaccinated with L. lactis NZ3900-VP1 were effectively protected when facing natural infestation of DHAV-3, which indicated that the recombinant L. lactis could serve as an effective vaccine to prevent DHAV-3 infection in ducklings.

TI Economic and immunisation safety surveillance characteristics of
   countries implementing no-fault compensation programmes for vaccine
   injuries
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Vaccine injury; No-fault compensation programmes; Country profiles
AB Improvements in vaccine safety surveillance and investigative capacity lead to identification of rare reactions attributable to vaccination. As a result, the issue of fair compensation for those who experience vaccine injuries is gaining growing attention. Although vaccine injury compensation programmes (VICP) have been developed in a few countries for more than 50 years, no global policy guidance to guide vaccine injury compensation in all countries wishing to adopt such compensation schemes is currently available. To update the landscape analysis of no-fault compensation programmes and characterize VICP implementing countries, we conducted a survey of all 194 Member States from the World Health Organization and received feedback from 151. This analysis describes the economic and vaccine safety surveillance characteristics of Member States implementing VICPs. This analysis describes the characteristics of 25 Member States implementing a compensation programmes. Characteristics examined include economic, vaccination and safety surveillance indicators. Twenty of the 25 Member States (80%) with compensation programmes are categorized as high-income countries, 20/25 (80%) met the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) safety indicator of reporting at least ten annual reports of adverse events following immunization per 100,000 population, 21/25 (84%) met the GVAP coverage indicator by achieving greater than 90% third dose of Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis vaccine (DTP3) and 17/25 (68%) assessed vaccine hesitancy in 2017. All Member States with VICP have a national immunization technical advisory group. This study identified growing interest in the implementation of no-fault compensation programs beyond high-income countries. Global policies guiding compensation should be developed for countries regardless of the maturity of their immunization programmes.
   Research in context: As a result of improved vaccine safety surveillance, World Health Organization (WHO) Member States are facing situations where known untoward serious vaccine reactions are documented, including in low-and middle-income settings. This has led to increased interest for the development of national no-fault compensation policies for vaccine injuries. As of 2010, compensation schemes for vaccine related injuries had been identified and characterized in 19 out of 194 WHO member states. All these programmes were in the industrialized world with none in low-and middle-income countries. Previous reviews have described the characteristics of the existing programmes based on the six common elements identified by Evans in 1999 with less emphasis on characteristics from countries implementing these no-fault compensation programmes.
   This manuscript aimed to identify predictors of countries implementing no-fault compensation programmes for vaccine injuries and update the inventory of existing programmes as part of a more comprehensive global landscape evaluation of existing programmes. This information will be useful for country self-evaluation and future compensation policy formulation as discussion to develop policies guiding the implementation of vaccine injury compensation continues to gain growing attention.

   Emergency; Emerging infectious diseases; Scientific communication; Phase
   III trial; Decision support system
AB Background: Licensed vaccines are urgently needed for emerging infectious diseases, but the nature of these epidemics causes challenges for the design of phase III trials to evaluate vaccine efficacy. Designing and executing rigorous, fast, and ethical, vaccine efficacy trials is difficult, and the decisions and limitations in the design of these trials encompass epidemiological, logistical, regulatory, statistical, and ethical dimensions.
   Results: Trial design decisions are complex and interrelated, but current guidance documents do not lend themselves to efficient decision-making. We created InterVax-Tool (http://vaxeval.com), an online, interactive decision-support tool, to help diverse stakeholders navigate the decisions in the design of phase Ill vaccine trials.
   InterVax-Tool offers high-level visual and interactive assistance through a set of four decision trees, guiding users through selection of the: (1) Primary Endpoint, (2) Target Population, (3) Randomization Scheme, and, (4) Comparator. We provide guidance on how key considerations-grouped as Epidemiological, Vaccine-related, Infrastructural, or Sociocultural-inform each decision in the trial design process.
   Conclusions: InterVax-Tool facilitates structured, transparent, and collaborative discussion of trial design, while recording the decision-making process. Users can save and share their decisions, which is useful both for comparing proposed trial designs, and for justifying particular design choices.
   Here, we describe the goals and features of InterVax-Tool as well as its application to the design of a Zika vaccine efficacy trial. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), major components of the tumor microenvironment (TME), promote tumor growth and metastasis and inhibit the anti-tumor immune response. We previously constructed a DNA vaccine expressing human FAP alpha, which is highly expressed by CAFs, to target these cells in the TME, and observed limited anti-tumor effects in the 4T1 breast cancer model. When the treatment time was delayed until tumor nodes formed, the anti-tumor effect of the vaccine completely disappeared. In this study, to improve the safety and efficacy, we constructed a new FAP alpha-targeted vaccine containing only the extracellular domain of human FAP alpha with a tissue plasminogen activator signal sequence for enhanced antigen secretion and immunogenicity. The number of CAFs was more effectively reduced by CD8(+) T cells induced by the new vaccine. This resulted in decreases in CCL2 and CXCL12 expression, leading to a significant decrease in the ratio of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the TME. Moreover, when mice were treated after the establishment of tumors, the vaccine could still delay tumor growth. To facilitate the future application of the vaccine in clinical trials, we further optimized the gene codons and reduced the homology between the vaccine and the original sequence, which may be convenient for evaluating the vaccine distribution in the human body. These results indicated that the new FAP alpha-targeted vaccine expressing an optimized secreted human FAP alpha induced enhanced anti-tumor activity by reducing the number of FAP alpha(+) CAFs and enhancing the recruitment of effector T cells in the 4T1 tumor model mice.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate the effectiveness of the herpes zoster vaccine Zostavax in a cohort of vaccinated individuals in Sweden.
   Methods: The study is a retrospective population-based matched cohort study conducted with data from health care registers in Stockholm Country. Primary endpoints were new diagnosis of HZ after administration of Zostavax. Individuals above the age of 50 years and living in Stockholm County in 2013 were included into the study. Ten non-vaccinated individuals per vaccinated were included and randomized into the cohort. The non-vaccinated were matched on age at index date and gender.
   Results: Zostavax had an overall effectiveness (VE) of 34% (HR = 0.66, 95% Cl: 0.55-0.78). When stratifying by age, 61-75 years was the only age group that showed a reduced risk of HZ (HR = 0.57; CI 0.44-0.73) compared to those that were non-vaccinated. As compared to the unvaccinated group, the VE was significant at days 180-359 (HR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.33-0.88), 360-539 (HR = 0.46; 95% CI 0.27-0.80) and at days 540-719 (HR = 0.56; 95% CI 0.35-0.90) after vaccination.
   Conclusion: This is the first population-based study in Sweden studying the effectiveness of HZ vaccination. Our findings are well in-line with previous studies, however studies addressing the longitudinal efficacy and effectiveness of Zostavax are still required. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Background: ROTAVAC (nHRV), derived naturally from the human 116E rotavirus (RV) neonatal strain, was licensed in India in 2015 based on promising results of a phase 3, safety and efficacy vaccine trial. As a pre-requisite for WHO prequalification, we compared the immunogenicity and safety of ROTAVAC (R) to those of a WHO-prequalified, Rotarix (R).
   Methods: We conducted a multicentre, open-labeled, randomized phase 4 clinical trial where 464 infants, 6-8 weeks of age were equally randomized to receive as licensed, the complete regimen of ROTAVAC (R) (3 doses; Group I) or Rotarix (R) (2 doses; Group II). Antibody responses (serum anti-RV Immunoglobulin A [IgA]) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The primary analysis was an assessment of non-inferiority of ROTAVAC (R) to Rotarix (R) for geometric mean concentration (GMC) for infants who received the complete regimen of either vaccine.
   Results: The GMC for Group I was 20.4 (95%Cl: 17.6, 23.6) and that for Group II was 24.8 (95%CI: 20.3, 30.3), the GMC ratio was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.05), thus meeting the non-inferiority criterion. Site-wise analysis of GMC titres revealed that one site had a peculiar pre-vaccination titre affecting only ROTAVAC (R) post-vaccination GMCs. Seroconversion rates were 35.3% (95%Cl: 29.0, 41.9) and 31.0% (95%Cl: 25.1, 37.4) for Groups I and Group II, respectively. There was no substantive difference in safety profiles between both vaccines.
   Conclusions: The complete regimen of ROTAVAC (R) demonstrated immunological non-inferiority to the complete regimen of Rotarix (R) with a clinically acceptable safety profile. Because the demand for RV vaccines is increasing as more countries are expanding their immunization schedules, the lack of need of a buffering agent, low dose volume (0.5 mL), non-interference with other concomitantly administered vaccines, and conformance with WHO-prequalification requirements provide ROTAVAC (R) the potential for widespread global usage. Post completion of this study, ROTAVAC (R) is now a WHO-prequalified vaccine. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objectives: Placental hypoxia is a hallmark of preeclampsia. SNP rs479200 in the EGLNI gene is associated with reduced responsiveness to hypoxia. Whether this translates into an association between SNP rs479200 and preeclampsia is not known. We evaluated the association of SNP rs479200 (T > C) with the risk of preeclampsia.
   Methods: This case-control study involved 600 pregnant women of whom 300 were preeclamptic and 300 were normotensive. SNP rs479200 was genotyped by PCR-RFLP method. Result Minor allele frequency was 44% in preeclamptic women and 53% in normotensive pregnant women (P = 1.8 x 10(-3); odds ratio = 1.43). The odds ratio was heterogeneous when compared after categorization of the preeclamptic group into clinical sub-groups. The association was significant with both mild (P = 6.2 x 10(-3)) and severe (3.8 x 10(-3)) preeclampsia. However, the odds ratio was 0.52 for mild preeclampsia and 1.43 for severe preeclampsia.
   Conclusion: The minor allele of SNP rs479200 is associated with the predisposition to preeclampsia. This association underlines the importance of oxygen sensing in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.

AB Background: In recent years, the molecular mechanism of plant growth and development has been reported in detail. GRAS genes, a plant-specific family of transcription factor, play critical roles in the process. GRAS transcription factors are associated with axillary shoot meristem formation, radial root patterning, phyto-hormones (gibberellins) signal transduction, light signaling, and abiotic or biotic stress.
   Objective: Here, we firstly investigated GRAS gene family in Dendrobium catenatum, an important medicinal and flowering orchid in China.
   Methods: The GRAS gene family in D. catenatum was cloned based on RNA-Seq data. Selected GRAS genes were introduced into Escherichia colt to express proteins.
   Results: Based on phylogenetic relationship with the Arabidopsis and Oryza GRAS family members, 47 GRAS genes from D. catenatum are identified and their deduced proteins are classified into 11 subgroups. Most of these GRAS genes contain one exon and closely related members in the phylogenetic tree have similar motif composition. Our result also reveals that GRAS genes in D. catenatum are widely distributed and expressed in different tissue. In addition, 35 GRAS genes are successfully cloned from different subgroups and 7 DoGRAS fusion proteins are induced using E. coli system. Moreover, 8 genes were up-regulated in different tissue following exposure to heat and salt stresses.
   Conclusion: Our findings provide valuable information and candidate genes for future functional analysis for improving the resistance of D. catenatum growth.

AB TTR-related amyloidosis (ATTR) is manifested in two allelic forms: familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) and cardiomyopathy (TTR-FAC), both caused by mutations in the TTR gene. The most prevalent mutation in Bulgaria is p.G1u89Gln. Markedly different age at onset and disease penetrance is noticed in Bulgarian p.Glu89Gln cases even in a single family or between genetically identical twins. The present study aimed to evaluate the transcription profile of the TTR gene in order to better understand the difference in disease onset and penetrance. Six p.Glu89Gln positive families were selected from our registry, based on intrafamilial differences in disease onset and penetrance. Plasma and urine specimens were collected from 13 patients and subjected to transcription analysis. Both mutant and wild type transcripts were visualized in a mixed transcription profile, which is the traditional model of autosomal gene expression. The results from a relative quantification of the mutant versus wild type transcript showed presence of the mutant transcript between 0.14 and 1.14 times against the wild type.
   In addition, monoallelic expression signature was also detected. Based on our results we propose a model of natural selection, which includes age-related allele exclusion or suppression: predominant expression of a wild type (at an early age) and mutant (at the process of ageing) alleles. The intrafamilial differences in disease onset and penetrance need to be considered in genetic counselling and in follow-up of mutation carriers.

AB Mixed-lineage leukaemia 1 (MLL1) enzyme plays major role in regulating genes associated with vertebrate development. Cell physiology and homeostasis is regulated by microRNAs in diverse microenvironment. In this investigation we have identified conserved miR-193a target sites within the 3'-UTR of MLL1 gene transcript. Utilizing wild type and mutated 3'-UTR constructs and luciferase reporter assays we have clearly demonstrated that miR-193a directly targets the 3'-UTR region of the MLL1 mRNA. Ectopic expression of miR-193a modulated global H3K4 mono-, di- and tri-methylation levels and affects the expression of CAV1, a gene which is specifically modulated by H3K4me3. To determine the implications of this in vitro finding in aberrant physiological conditions we analyzed prostate cancer tissue samples. In this context miR-193a RNA was undetectable and MLL1 was highly expressed with concomitantly high levels of H3K4me, H3K4me2, and H3K4me3 enrichment in the promoters of MLL1 responsive genes. Finally, we showed that prolonged ectopic expression of miR-193a inhibits growth and cell migration, and induces apoptosis. Thus, while our study unveils amplitude of the epigenome, including miRnome it establishes that; (i) miR-193a directly target MLL1 mRNA, (ii) miR-193a impair MLL1 protein production, (iii) miR-193a reduces the overall methylation marks of the genome.

AB The study of EGFR gene mutational profile in NSCLC patients has a special clinical significance in the selection of patients for tyrosine-kinase inhibitors therapy. From 2017, the targeted therapy started to be accessible in public sector in Morocco, thus, the implementation of techniques for the molecular characterization of EGFR mutations in the laboratories became a necessity. The aim of this study was to present targeted methods "ADx-ARMS technology and the Idylla (TM) system" for the identification of EGFR mutational profile, methods that can be implemented in our clinical laboratories for routine analysis instead of outsourcing analysis to other countries. We conducted this study by processing 239 cases of NSCLC patients. Using the DNA extracted from the FFPE tissue, we evaluated somatic mutations in exons 18 to 21 of the tyrosine-kinase domain of EGFR gene by HRM-PCR combined to real time PCR "ADx-ARMS technology" and Idylla" system. These sensitive methods showed that among the positive mutant cases, the distribution of mutations was as follows: 70% of patients having a deletion in exon 19, 15% in exon 21 (L858R), 7.5% in exon 20 and 7.5% in exon 18 (G719X). All of the positive EGFR mutations cases were aden ocarcinoma and 42.1% of them were smokers. These results show the need to incorporate a quick and efficient method for the identification of EGFR mutation into routine practice in our laboratories, allowing more patients to benefit from targeted therapy.

AB Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are crucial regulators in the progression of various diseases. Although the role of lncRNAs in prostate cancer (PCa) has been studied in recent years, there are still numerous lncRNAs need to be elucidated. This study aims to detect the role of lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 15 (SNHG15) in human prostate cancer. Using qRT-PCR analysis, we identified the upregulation of SNHG15 in PCa cell lines. Loss-of function assays were conducted to determine the regulatory effect of SNHG15 on PCa cell proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). According to the results of functional assays, we found that knockdown of SNHG15 impaired cell viability, suppressed cell proliferation, inhibited cell migration and invasion, reversed EMT progress. All these findings revealed the oncogenic function of SNHG15 in PCa. Mechanism investigation revealed that SNHG15 was located in the cytoplasm of PCa cells and acted as a molecular sponge of microRNA-338-3p (miR-338-3p). Moreover, FKBP prolyl isomerase 1A (FKBP1A) was a target of miR-338-3p. This investigation demonstrated that SNHG15 may serve as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to regulate miR-338-3p and FKBP1A. Finally, the involvement of miR-338-3p and FKBP1A in SNHG15-mediated biological function was demonstrated by performing rescue assays. In summary, our study revealed the function of a novel pathway in PCa.

AB Obesity is a major public health concern worldwide. Genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors contribute to the multifactorial etiology of obesity. Evidence suggests an association between human Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) Val66Met single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and obesity. Reduced plasma BDNF levels have also been reported in patients with eating disorders and obesity. We aimed to evaluate the BDNF Val66Met (rs6265) SNP and also plasma BDNF levels in morbidly obese patients compared with healthy normal controls in southern Iran. One hundred morbidly obese patients and one hundred eight healthy normal controls were enrolled. Blood-derived DNA samples were genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasma BDNF levels were evaluated using a commercially available sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for human BDNF. Data analysis was performed by SPSS software, version 18.0. Genotype distribution was not significantly different between obese patients and controls. However, plasma BDNF levels were significantly lower in obese patients compared with controls. Interestingly, a significant association was found between BDNF Val66Met SNP and plasma BDNF levels. No relationship was observed between BDNF Val66Met SNP and all assessed demographic and clinical characteristics of obese patients. It seems that plasma BDNF levels were associated with both obesity and BDNF Val66Met SNP. However, this association was not found between BDNF Val66Met SNP and obesity. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed for more detailed assessment of this genetic variation as a potential biomarker for obesity.

AB The stingless bee Melipona bicolor is the only bee in which true polygyny occurs. Its mitochondrial genome was first sequenced in 2008, but it was incomplete and no information about its transcription was known. We combined short and long reads of M. bicolor DNA with RNASeq data to obtain insights about mitochondrial evolution and gene expression in bees. The complete genome has 15,001 bp, including a control region of 255 bp that contains all conserved structures described in honeybees with the highest AT content reported so far for bees (98.1%), displaying a compact but functional region. Gene expression control is similar to other insects however unusual patterns of expression may suggest the existence of different isoforms for the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA. Results reveal unique and shared features of the mitochondrial genome in terms of sequence evolution and gene expression making M. bicolor an interesting model to study mitochondrial genomic evolution.

AB Arachis species produce flowers aerially, and then grow into the ground, where they develop into fruits; a feature that is unique to Arachis species. We hypothesized that Arachis species evolved genes specifically involved in the control of aerial flowers and the formation of underground fruits. Arachis duranensis is more resistant to biotic and abiotic stressors. Here, we compared different legume species and identified Arachis duranensis-specific genes. We analyzed gene expression patterns, base substitution patterns and sequence features between genes that are conserved across legume plants and A. duranensis-specific genes. Furthermore, we tested the role of A. duranensis-specific genes during seed development, response to nematode Meloidogyne arenaria infection and drought stress. We found that A. duranensis-specific genes had characteristics of young genes. The gene expression level and breadth were lower in the A. duranensis-specific genes compared to conserved genes. The A. duranensis-specific genes had higher codon usage bias than conserved genes, and the polypeptide length and GC content at the three codon sites were lower compared to conserved genes. Of the A. duranensis-specific genes, single-copy and duplicated genes had different features. The RNA-seq result showed A. duranensis-specific genes were involved in seed development, as well as response to nematode infection and drought stress. In addition, we detected asymmetric functions in A. duranensis-specific duplicated genes in response to nematode infection and drought stress.

AB Medulloblastoma (MB) is characterized by highly invasive embryonal neuro-epithelial tumors that metastasize via cerebrospinal fluid. MB is difficult to treat and the chemotherapy is associated with significant toxicities and potential long-term disabilities. Previously, we showed that small molecule, clotam (tolfenamic acid: TA) inhibited MB cell proliferation and tumor growth in mice by targeting, survivin. Overexpression of survivin is associated with aggressiveness and poor prognosis in several cancers, including MB. The aim of this study was to test combination treatment involving Vincristine (VCR), a standard chemotherapeutic drug for MB and TA against MB cells. DAOY and D283 MB cells were treated with 10 pg/mL TA or VCR (DAOY: 2 ng/mL; D283: 1 ng/mL) or combination (TA + VCR). These optimized doses were lower than individual IC50 values. The effect of single or combination treatment on cell viability (CellTiterGlo kit), Combination Index (Chou-Talalay method based on median-drug effect analysis), activation of apoptosis and cell cycle modulation (by flow cytometry using Annexin V and propidium iodide respectively) and the expression of associated markers including survivin (Western immunoblot) were determined. Combination Index showed moderate synergistic cytotoxic effect in both cells. When compared to individual agents, the combination of TA and VCR increased MB cell growth inhibition, induced apoptosis and caused cell cycle (G(2)/M phase) arrest. Survivin expression was also decreased by the combination treatment. TA is effective for inducing the anti-proliferative response of VCR in MB cells. MB has four distinct genetic/molecular subgroups. Experiments were conducted with MB cells representing two subgroups (DAOY: SHH group; D283: group 4/3). TA-induced inhibition of survivin expression potentially destabilizes mitotic microtubule assembly, sensitizing MB cells and enhancing the efficacy of VCR.

AB The global biodiversity of domesticated red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus) is gradually eroding by replacement with commercial poultry breeds and results loss of valuable genetic and physical traits like resistance to disease, extreme environment, etc. posing a threat to the poultry genetic resources. Very fewer reports exist on Indian poultry diversity, especially native chicken of India. Therefore, species identification and inventorying of the poultry genetic resource is indispensable. Thus, the present study aimed to characterize indigenous chicken from bio-diversity hotspot of Sunderban and Northeast India using DNA sequence based barcoding approach. A total of 15 CO1 (Cytochrome c Oxidase-I) DNA barcode of different indigenous chicken were newly sequenced along with 6 previously published sequences from our laboratory and compared with the available data of distinctive genera of Phasianidae as per the standard protocol and are identified as Gallus gallus. About 98.96% of the Phasianid birds were successfully delimitated into the respective species except for 12 congeneric pairs whose minimum interspecific K2P (Kimura 2-parameter) distance overlaps with the maximum intraspecific distance (3.9%). The least genetic divergence is observed between G. gallus and G. varius (0.013%) and highest between G. gallus and G. lafayettei (0.059%). The NJ tree showed a cohesive clustering of indigenous chicken with G. gallus and distinct with respect to all the different species under study, thereby revealing their taxonomic position except for few G. sonneratti that showed mixed clustering with G. gallus. This may be due to the genetic introgression between the species.

AB Dermatophagoides farinae are an important mite species that cause stored product deterioration and allergic diseases. They widely breed in human habitats because of their strong tolerance to extreme external temperatures. However, mechanisms underlying the stress response and tolerance of D. farinae are unclear. We hypothesized that heat shock protein 70 plays an important role in the heat stress response of D. farinae. In this study, we determined the survival rates of D. farinae at high temperatures (37 degrees C-45 degrees C) by performing temperature -gradient experiments in vitro and assessed the expression level of HSP70 by performing RT-qPCR. First, we confirmed that HSP70 regulated the heat stress response of D. farinae, with maximum heat stress regulation observed at 41 degrees C. Next, we confirmed the presence of a Dicer enzyme-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) pathway in D. farinae by searching the NCBI database and a Dicer site prediction website. Finally, we performed RNAi in D. farinae by using an immersion method with screened dsHSP70 fragments. Moreover, we performed concentration-gradient experiments to determine that 600 ng/1 was the minimal effective concentration of dsHSP70 for silencing HSP70. These results confirm that HSP70 regulates the heat stress response of D. farinae. The present study is the first to report the use of the non-invasive and highly sensitive immersion method for performing RNAi in D. farinae. The results of the present study provide a technical foundation for performing functional gene research and for developing molecular prevention and control strategies against medically important mites.

AB DNA ligase III (LIG3) has been implicated in the etiology of cancer. However, few studies have accessed the association of LIG3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with gastric cancer risk, especially in Chinese population. The current study was undertaken to investigate contribution of LIG3 gene polymorphisms to gastric cancer risk. We first applied TaqMan assay to genotype three LIG3 gene SNPs (rs1052536 C > T, rs3744356 C > T, rs4796030 A > C) in 1142 patients with gastric cancer and 1173 healthy controls. And then, we adopted unconditional multivariate logistic regression analysis to estimate the association between LIG3 SNP genotypes and gastric cancer risk. In all, no positive association was found between the three LIG3 SNPs and gastric cancer risk in single locus analysis or combined risk genotypes analysis. However, compared with participants with rs4796030 AA genotype, participants with the AC/CC had a decreased risk of developing tumors from cardia at an adjusted OR of 0.68 (95% CI = 0.48-0.96, P = 0.026). In addition, we found that participants harboring 2-3 risk genotypes were at a significantly increased risk of developing tumor from cardia (adjusted OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.16-2.28, P = 0.005). These results suggest that genetic variations in LIG3 gene may play a weak role in modifying the risk of gastric cancer. Future functional studies should be performed to elucidate the biological role of LIG3 polymorphisms in gastric cancer carcinogenesis.

AB Small circular RNAs occur in many cells. Theoretical considerations designed to mimick primordial RNAs designed 25 theoretical, minimal 22-nucleotide long circular RNAs (RNA rings) forming stem-loop hairpins, including one codon per amino acid, a start and a stop codon. These RNA rings resemble consensus tRNAs, whose predicted anticodons assign to each RNA ring a potential cognate amino acid. Assuming dual translator and messenger roles, three consecutive translation rounds produce 21-residue-long peptides, seven codons at each round. In these conditions, steric hindrances between tRNA(-like) translators competing for partially overlapping nucleotide triplets can be reduced if none of the seven codons produces by circular permutation (position 1 -> , or position 3 -> ) any of the six others. This non-permutability of codon sets is one of the conditions that define potential circular codes regulating translational frame. A near-universal maximal self-complementary circular code exists in reading frames of natural genes, and permutations of this circular code define maximal circular codes in each + 1, +2 gene frames. Chronologically scaling RNA rings according to the genetic code inclusion order of their cognate amino acid, codon numbers belonging to the natural frame + 1 circular code X1 decrease with cognate amino acid inclusion order, those belonging to the natural frame 0 circular code X0 increase. RNA rings with early cognates apparently reflect pre-(tRNA-like)-adaptor translation by direct codon-amino acid affinity with partially overlapping consecutive codons where X1 regulated translation. Translation of non overlapping consecutive codons evolved in parallel with RNA rings' cognate inclusion in the genetic code and with X0. Hence the complex "multi-frame" natural circular codes potentially evolved spontaneously from small coding circular RNAs mimicked by theoretical minimal RNA rings. Modern reading frames evolved from earlier reading frames corresponding to modem + 1 frames.

AB Cervical cancer (CC), a common gynecological carcinoma, is a serious threat to women's health. The dysregulation of circular RNAs (circRNAs) is associated with the pathogenesis of cervical cancer. Therefore, we explored the role of circ-ATP8A2 in CC cell development and progression. Circ-ATP8A2 profiles in CC specimens and cells were detected using real-time PCR. In addition, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB), flow cytometric, and Transwell experiments were carried out on HeLa and SW756 cells to determine cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion. Furthermore, the mechanism of circ-ATP8A2 was explored by dual-luciferase reporter system. Circ-ATP8A2 was significantly enhanced in CC specimens and cells. Knockdown of circ-ATP8A2 inhibited cell proliferation, migratory and invasive capacities and increased apoptotic cells. Ectopically expressed circ-ATP8A2 induced the opposite effects. For the mechanism exploration, circATP8A2 sponges miR-433 to release its suppression on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression at post-transcriptional level. What's more, circ-ATP8A2 could promote cell progression by miR-433/EGFR axis in CC cells. Collectively, this work might offer a potential treatment target for CC.

AB Variants of KCNQ4 are one of the most common causes of dominantly inherited nonsyndromic hearing loss. We investigated a consanguineous family in which two individuals had prelignual hearing loss, apparently inherited in a recessive mode. Whole-exome sequencing analyses demonstrated genetic heterogeneity as variants in two different genes segregated with the phenotype in two branches of the family. Members in one branch were homozygous for a pathogenic variant of TMC1. The other two affected individuals were homozygous for a missense pathogenic variant in KCNQ4 c.872C > T; p.(Pro291Leu). These two individuals had prelingual, progressive moderate to severe hearing loss, while a heterozygous carrier had late onset mild hearing loss. Our work demonstrates that p.Pro2911 variant is semi-dominantly inherited. This is the first report of semi-dominance of a KCNQ4 variant.

ID COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH; PREDICTION; IDENTIFICATION
AB Identification of splice sites is imperative for prediction of gene structure. Machine learning-based approaches (MLAs) have been reported to be more successful than the rule-based methods for identification of splice sites. However, the strings of alphabets should be transformed into numeric features through sequence encoding before using them as input in MLAs. In this study, we evaluated the performances of 8 different sequence encoding schemes i.e., Bayes kernel, density and sparse (DS), distribution of tri-nucleotide and 1st order Markov model (DM), frequency difference distance measure (FDDM), paired-nucleotide frequency difference between true and false sites (FDTF), 1st order Markov model (MM1), combination of both 1st and 2nd order Markov model (MM1 + MM2) and 2nd order Markov model (MM2) in respect of predicting donor and acceptor splice sites using 5 supervised learning methods (ANN, Bagging, Boosting, RF and SVM). The encoding schemes and machine learning methods were first evaluated in 4 species i.e., A. thaliana, C. elegans, D. melanogaster and H. sapiens, and then performances were validated with another four species i.e., Ciona intestinalis, Dictyostelium discoideum, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Trypanosoma brucei. In terms of ROC (receiver-operating-characteristics) and PR (precision-recall) curves, FDTF encoding approach achieved higher accuracy followed by either MM2 or FDDM. Further, SVM was found to achieve higher accuracy (in terms of ROC and PR curves) followed by RF across encoding schemes and species. In terms of prediction accuracy across species, the SVM-FDTF combination was optimum than other combinations of classifiers and encoding schemes. Further, splice site prediction accuracies were observed higher for the species with low intron density. To our limited knowledge, this is the first attempt as far as comprehensive evaluation of sequence encoding schemes for prediction of splice sites is concerned. We have also developed an R-package EncDNA (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EncDNA/index.html) for encoding of splice site motifs with different encoding schemes, which is expected to supplement the existing nucleotide sequence encoding approaches. This study is believed to be useful for the computational biologists for predicting different functional elements on the genomic DNA.

AB Lonicera macranthoides Hand. -Mazz. is an important medicinal and economical plant in China, however, the codon usage bias (CUB) in L. macranthoides genes is still unknown. In this study, L. macranthoides transcriptome sequencing has been completed, and codon usage patterns in 36,090 reconstructed genes from the L. macranthoides transcriptome were examined. The mean GC content and GC3 value is 44.9% and 43.1%, respectively, which indicates that nucleotide contents of L. macranthoides genome is somewhat AT rich, and its codon bias pattern tends to use A/T-ending codons. According to neutrality plot, ENC plot, PR2-Bias plot and correspondence analysis, we know that both compositional constraint under selection and mutation could affect the CUB in L. macranthoides, and the mutation is the most determinant factor. Meanwhile, gene expression levels can influence its codon usage pattern. Furthermore, we identified 29 optimal codons and most of them ended with A/U. The study will lay a foundation for future research on gene prediction, genetic engineering and molecular evolution in L. macranthoides.

AB Fatty acid desaturases (Fads) are a key enzyme in the process of biosynthesis of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs). In this study, we cloned the full-length sequence of the SiFad1 gene (SiFad1) and analyzed its expression profiles during different developmental stages and in different tissues of Strongylocentrotus intermedius. The full-length cDNA of SiFad1 is composed of 1086 bp, with a putative open reading frame of 885 bp encoding a polypeptide of 294 amino acid (AA) residues. The predicted molecular mass of SiFad1 is 34,67 kDa and its theoretical pi is 8.41. The presence of conserved motifs including three histidine boxes (HXXHH, HXXHH, XXXHH), a FA desaturases domain and three transmembrane domains suggests that SiFad1 belongs to the microsomal fatty acid desaturases family. Its tissue distribution showed that the highest expression of SiFad1 is in the intestine and the weakest expression is in Aristotle's lantern of S. intermedius. Time-course expression measurements in different developmental stages showed the highest expression of SiFad1 occurs in the gastrula and the weakest expression in the juvenile sea urchin. Knock-down of SiFad1 by specific siRNA revealed that the significantly depressed expression of Elovl.5 had decreased in the coelomocytes, intestines and gonads at 24 h post transfection, indicating that the downstream target gene of SiFad1 is Elovl5 and SiFad1 and Elov15 have positive regulatory effects. When we examined the changes in fatty acids in the gonads before and after interference, the results showed that after 24 h of interference, the content of C20:4n-6 produced by SiFad1 had decreased. Taken together, these results will enable us to understand the role of SiFad1 in fatty acid anabolism, which will help us to understand the fatty acid synthesis pathways and regulatory mechanisms of Strongylocentrotus intermedius and provide a theoretical experimental basis for improving the ability of sea urchins to synthesize fatty acids and cultivating sea urchins of higher quality and nutritional value.

AB The solute carrier 6 (SLC6) gene family, functioning as neurotransmitter transporters, plays the crucial roles in neurotransmission, cellular and organismal homeostasis. In this study, we found an expansion of SLC6 family gene in the genome of chordate invertebrate Ciona savignyi. A total of 40 candidate genes including 29 complete and 11 putative genes were identified as SLC6 family gene homologs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of these Ciona SLC6 genes were highly conserved with the vertebrate ones, although gene duplication and gene losses did exist. Four genes were selected from SLC6 subfamilies to be further investigated for their functional characteristics on cell growth and migration through overexpression approach in cultured cell lines. The results showed both SLC6A7 and SLC6A17 from amino acid transporters AA1 and AA2 sub-families, respectively, significantly suppressed the cell proliferation and migration. While SLC6A1 and SLC6A4, which were classified into GABA and monoamine transporters, respectively, did not affect the cell proliferation and migration in HEK293T, HeLa, and MCF7 cells. The whole set of C. savignyi SLC6 genes identified in this study provides an important genomic resource for future biochemical, physiological, and phylogenetic studies on SLC6 gene family. Our experimental data demonstrated that Ciona amino acid transporters, such as SLC6A7 and SLC6A17, were essential for cell physiology and behaviors, indicating their crucially potential roles in the control of cell proliferation and migration during ascidian embryogenesis.
