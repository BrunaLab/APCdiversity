AB A combined field and numerical study of water flow and solute transport was conducted along a clean transect of a tidal gravel beach in Smith Island, Prince William Sound (PWS) that was heavily polluted after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Water table and pore water salinity were directly measured in the field. The numerical model MARUN, validated with the field observations, was used to simulate subsurface flow and dissolved salt transport processes. Our study identified a two-layer hydraulic structure in the beach, a high-permeability upper layer and a low-permeability layer at the bottom. Numerical simulations indicated that the density gradient between the saltwater and freshwater strongly affects solute transport in the intertidal zone of the beach. A sensitivity study indicated that depth to and slope of the bedrock had major effects on solute transport in the lower layer, but minor effects in the upper layer. A deep bedrock caused the water particles travelling in the lower layer to penetrate deeper in the beach. Our study revealed high terrestrial freshwater recharge to the transect which promotes the removal of oil in two-layer beaches by maintaining the water table at or above the interface of the two layers. The study presented in this paper has strong implications on the oil persistence and associated removal strategies along the Alaskan coastline polluted with oil. Findings from this work in relation to oiled beaches include: 1) oil tends to persist at locations of small freshwater recharge and 2) Prior to oil arriving to the shoreline, one could minimize oil penetration into the beach by releasing water onto the beach at the high tide line during low tides.

AB The changes in runoff and sediment load due to various approaches in land use management have recently received considerable attention. In the present paper, the impact of land use change under collaborative management framework on water and sediment load was investigated by combined usage of hydrologic modelling and land use maps. Three groups of stakeholders viz. residents, policy makers and executive organizations were involved in decision making process. Three prioritization procedures of Condorcet, Borda scoring and Fallback bargaining were elected to rank sub-watersheds and managerial practices. The impact of different managerial scenarios was assessed by applying time-area concept and through analyzing changes in important components of output hydrographs and sediment graphs. Results demonstrated significant agreement among stakeholder's attitudes and quantitative outcomes. The results illustrated obvious impact on runoff and sediment resulted from scenarios for land use management. So that, the impact on sediment load (with maximum reduction benefit of 19.41%) was significantly greater than that of runoff (with maximum reduction benefit of 8.07%). Manipulation of farmlands and poor rangelands and afforestation caused recognizable reduction on runoff and sediment. Rangelands restoration also satisfied socioeconomic status and environmental criterion of the study area. Considering basic differences in prioritization procedures, there were considerable agreement among stakeholders in land use management and practice prioritization. The results further indicated that the watershed management projects should focus on remediation of vegetation cover of the rangelands, which simultaneously tackles land degradation and improves economic condition. However, the present study revealed lack of proper connection between residents and authorities. Nevertheless, as a pioneer comanagement endeavor, the present qualitative and quantitative results facilitate group decision making and participated planning procedure at the watershed scale.

AB Daily streamflow prediction is important for flood warning, navigation, sediment control, reservoir operations and environmental protection. The current paper examines the prediction and estimation capability of a new heuristic method, optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OP-ELM) model, for daily streamflows of Fujiangqiao and Shehang stations at Fujiang River. Prediction accuracy of OP-ELM method is compared with other soft computing models, i.e. adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system-particle swarm optimization (ANFIS-PSO), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and M5 model tree (M5Tree) using cross validation technique. Prediction results of the both stations reported that the OP-ELM and ANFIS-PSO are the best in modeling daily streamflows of upstream and downstream, respectively. For improving prediction accuracy of the OP-ELM method, various kernel types are tried and the linear, linear + sigmoid + Gaussian and linear + sigmoid provide the best results for both stations. The OP-ELM outperforms the other methods during estimation of downstream streamflow using hydro climatic data as input. The OP-ELM reduces the prediction error of ANFI-SPSO by 12% in estimation of daily streamflow. It is also found that including local data considerably improves the prediction accuracy in estimation of downstream streamflows. The overall results indicate that the OP-ELM method could be successfully used in predicting and estimating daily streamflow by using hydro climatic data as inputs.

AB A framework for joint verification of river flow and precipitation ensembles is developed and demonstrated over Britain for eventual use in an operational flood forecasting setting. The river flow ensembles are obtained from a distributed hydrological model, the G2G model, using an ensemble of 15 min precipitation accumulations as input on a 1 km grid. The precipitation ensemble consists of operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) forecasts from the Met Office Unified Model. Both hourly and daily precipitation accumulations are verified, and the relevance of different accumulation periods discussed in the context of timing errors and hydrological response. The implications of precipitation observation error are investigated by comparing verification results from raingauge- and radar-derived precipitation estimates. Challenges of verification using only a limited record of precipitation ensembles, from a system only relatively recently made operational, are addressed. Methods of obtaining more robust verification statistics, given the available ensembles, are presented and demonstrated for an example period in December 2015. For precipitation, percentile thresholds are used to ensure a given number of threshold crossing events for analysis using a contingency table and derived skill scores. For river flow, percentiles thresholds are of less relevance to operational flood guidance. Instead, exceedance of a flow threshold of given rarity (return-period) is used as a surrogate measure of flood severity. At the regional scale, both river flow and precipitation verification analyses are found to be dependent on the locations considered. This is linked to variations in precipitation amount. For river flows, catchment properties - and in particular catchment size - are found to be a key influence on verification. It is demonstrated how such behaviour can be used to obtain more-robust river flow verification statistics at sub-regional scales.

AB Understanding the impact of climate change on borehole yields from fractured aquifers is essential for future water resources planning and management. Although variation in hydraulic conductivity with depth (VKD) in fractured aquifers is a well-known phenomenon, the relative significance of climate change and VKD on borehole yield estimates is poorly understood. We hypothesize that VKD exerts a significant additional control on borehole yields under climate change that has not been considered in yield assessments to date. We developed a simple two-layered radial groundwater flow model of an idealised pumping borehole in the fractured Chalk aquifer of south-east England, and applied 11 VKD profiles based on a simple conceptual representation of variation in hydraulic conductivity with depth in the Chalk. For each time step, the transmissivity is calculated by integrating the VKD profile over the saturated depth calculated at the previous time step, For each VKD profile and resulting transmissivity, we applied 20 climate scenarios and six constant pumping rates for the period 1962-2014. We then estimated borehole yields based on the derived lowest pumping water levels during key drought years (e.g. 1976). We show that the hydraulic properties of the aquifer are more significant (p < 0.001) than changes in climate (p > 0.1) in controlling lowest pumping groundwater levels when abstraction rates are < 9000 m(3)/day, and that both are significant when abstraction 9000 m(3)/day. Hydraulic conductivity is as significant a control as climate on borehole yields, although responses are non-linear associated with whether pumping water level-pumping rate curves intersect key yield constraints (e.g. pump intake depth, major inflow horizons). It is recommended that variations in hydraulic conductivity with depth are taken into consideration in future assessments of borehole yields under climate change. The approach presented is generic and can be applied across different aquifers where vertical heterogeneity is present and affects transmissivity.

AB Frequent occurrence of flood and ice disasters caused by river channel sedimentation in the Upper Yellow River of China has seriously threatened the lives and property of downstream residents, which has become the most challenging issues in harnessing the Yellow River. In this paper, we aim at optimizing water-sediment regulation that considers two cascade reservoirs (Longyangxia and Liujiaxia) as the regulatory bodies using one multi-objective model (sediment transport and hydropower generation) and two single-objective models (sediment transport only, and hydropower generation only). We propose an innovative approach (FSS-MOPSO) that hybrids the Feasible Search Space (FSS) with the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm to search the optimal solutions for the multi-objective joint operation of cascade reservoirs. We analyze the transformation rules of water-sediment regulation among five objectives (hydropower generation, sediment transport, water supply, flood control and ice control) under various optimization schemes. The results indicate that the conflict between the hydropower generation objective and the sediment transport objective is prominent. An extreme case indicates that an increase in hydropower output by 2.31 billion kWh (17.6% increase) would greatly reduce the amount of sediment transport (73.5% decrease) while only makes little effects on the other three objectives. The results demonstrate that the optimal water-sediment regulation not only can ensure to meet water demands in the future (2030) but can provide an important guideline to safely operate cascade reservoirs during ice and flood periods. The research findings contribute to the identification of the relationship among objectives and strategy recommendations on water-sediment regulation for efficient cascade reservoirs operation in the Upper Yellow River.

AB Blending satellite-based precipitation estimation (SPE) data and in-situ gauge observation data can generate effective spatially-continuous-precipitation estimates with improved accuracy. This study assessed the improvement of the long-term SPE when blending with in-situ gauge observations for drought monitoring, using a simple but effective blending method named the geographical difference analysis (GDA) method and with the Precipitation Estimation from Remote Sensed Information by using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Records (PERSIANN-CDR) as case study. In-situ precipitation observations from three meteorological station sets with different densities-the sparse (50), medium (200), dense (727) station set-were adopted to evaluate the effect of gauge density on the performance of SPE-gauge data blending. Two widely-used indices-standardized precipitation index (SPI) and self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index (SC_PDSI)-were used as case studies. Except the case of sparse 50-station subset, the SPE-gauge blending shows apparent improvement to the raw PERSIANN-CDR data, for both the accuracy of precipitation input and many aspects of drought monitoring, e.g. reproducing drought magnitude and revealing spatial pattern of drought, in which SC_PDSI shows more significant improvement than SPI. The dense 727-station set shows the largest improvement in the blending data, but the corresponding station-only interpolations also exhibit comparable performance to the blending data, indicating lower utilization value of the SPE data for these cases. Only the blending results of the medium-density 200-station set shows satisfactory drought monitoring performance as well as significant improvements relative to the station-only interpolations. According to the quantitative analyses, the medium density (about 50-75 gauges per 10(6) km(2) in our cases) might be the most economic gauge density for SPE-gauge blending, as it has satisfactory improvement in blending results, can make fullest use of the advantages of SPE data and requires relatively fewer gauges. Our results can help to understand how the SPE-gauge blending could improve the SPE-based drought monitoring and serves as a reference for applying drought monitoring under the data-limited conditions. Subsequent studies or applications should also carefully consider the effect of gauge density.

AB Climate variability and land use/cover change have a significant impact on hydrological regimes, especially in arid and semi-arid regions, which have critical water shortage problems. Using the Mann-Kendall's test methodology, trends in hydro-climatic variables including precipitation, temperature, land use, and water balance indicators have been detected during the last 60 years in the Middle Yellow River Basin (MYRB). Generally, the MYRB has become much warmer and drier. Compared with 1980, the land use has also changed - to a small degree by 2000 and to a significant degree by 2015, with an increase in vegetation coverage. There are decreasing trends for streamflow and water resources and a shift in water balance, with less precipitation generating streamflow and more water being evaporated, especially after 2000. The response of water balance to climate change and land use/cover change, and the attribution for streamflow decrease was analyzed in the 10 sub-regions of the MYRB, based on the regionalization of parameter w of Fu's Formula. The results indicate that with an increase of E-0/P (potential evaporation/precipitation) or w, there is an increase of ET/P (evapotranspiration/precipitation) and a decrease of R/P (streamflow/precipitation). But, the increasing rate of ET/P decreases with an increase of E-0/P or w. Based on the "natural period" streamflow of 1956-1979, climate variability accounts for 75.8% of streamflow decrease in 1980-2000. But in 2001-2016, land use/cover change is the main factor in streamflow decrease, accounting for 75.5% of the decline. The results are useful for understanding what has happened and what will happen under climate change and land use/cover change, for adaption to future water resources management.

AB River ice plays an important role in biophysical and socio-economic systems in northern regions and is related to climate variability at both regional and global scales. The objective of this study was to estimate river ice thickness using several new machine learning methods: extreme learning machine (ELM), least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), and their bootstrap versions (BELM and BLSSVM, respectively). To explore the usefulness of these methods, we chose two stations, Mackenzie River and Yellowknife River in the Mackenzie River Basin in the Northwest Territories, Canada. The variables used to develop the river ice thickness (cm) estimation models included: water flow (m(3)/s), snow depth (cm) and mean air temperature (degrees C) (with a time period of 1981-2016). Two techniques, namely the Kendall-Theil Robust Line (KTRL) and the regularized expectation maximization (RegEm) methods, were utilized to fill in the missing values in the time series records. The performance of the developed models was measured using several statistical indicators (correlation coefficient (r), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), their normalized equivalents expressed as a percentage (root mean square percentage error (RMSPE) and mean absolute percentage error (RMPE)), bias error (BIAS) and Willmott's Index (WI)). Results indicated that the bootstrap ELM model outperformed the ELM, LSSVM and BLSSVM models in the testing phases based on a number of statistical measures. For the BELM using RegEM at the Mackenzie River station, the results were: r = 0.826, RMSE = 19.756 cm, RMSPE = 33.011%, MAE = 15.364 cm, MAPE = 35.988%, BIAS = 1.199 cm and WI = 0.818. For the BELM using KTRL at the Yellowknife River station, the results were: r = 0.856, RMSE = 15.444 cm, RMSPE = 19.468%, MAE = 12.006 cm, MAPE = 19.045%, BIAS = 0.966 cm and WI = 0.868. The findings of this study indicate that the BELM machine learning approach using meteorological variables is a promising new tool for river ice thickness estimation.

AB Calibrating a spatially distributed hydrological model of a region with complex and highly diverse agricultural settings is a difficult task. It becomes even more challenging, if major parts of the hydrology are human controlled, e.g. through irrigation agriculture. In this study, a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was set up and calibrated for an entirely managed meso-scale irrigation scheme, where irrigation channels are the only water-courses and no natural streams exist. An automated and spatially distributed model calibration was applied, implementing the global Dynamically Dimensioned Search Algorithm (DDS), and using Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) as objective function. To account for the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of water balance fluxes in the calibration process, remote sensing-derived evapotranspiration (ET) estimates with a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km, were used as observational data. Results showed that the automated and spatially distributed model calibration was able to increase the model ET simulation performance from 0.04 to 0.27 KGE. However, a strong land-use dependent goodness-of-fit, ranging from approx. -0.60 KGE to 0.60 KGE for individual land-use types, revealed that the information, extracted from remote sensing-derived ET estimates used in this study, is lacking the necessary spatial heterogeneity. An unsatisfactory spatial comparison between simulated ET and ET derived from remote sensing estimates showed to inhibit better calibration results for the study area, which is characterized by small-scale and diverse cropping patterns. Using a modified remote sensing-derived ET product, which accounts for land-use class dependent ET characteristics, improved the overall calibration results to 0.40 KGE. A cross-validation could indicate a successful application of this automated and spatially distributed model calibration approach, using the modified ET product.

AB Flood changes may be attributed to drivers of change that belong to three main classes: atmospheric, catchment and river system drivers. In this work, we propose a data-based attribution approach for selecting which driver best relates to variations in time of the flood frequency curve. The flood peaks are assumed to follow a Gumbel distribution, whose location parameter changes in time as a function of the decadal variations of one of the following alternative covariates: annual and extreme precipitation for different durations, an agricultural land use intensification index, and reservoir construction in the catchment, quantified by an index. The parameters of this attribution model are estimated by Bayesian inference. Prior information on one of these parameters, the elasticity of flood peaks to the respective driver, is taken from the existing literature to increase the robustness of the method to spurious correlations between flood and covariate time series. Therefore, the attribution model is informed in two ways: by the use of covariates, representing the drivers of change, and by the priors, representing the hydrological understanding of how these covariates influence floods. The Watanabe-Akaike information criterion is used to compare models involving alternative covariates. We apply the approach to 96 catchments in Upper Austria, where positive flood peak trends have been observed in the past 50 years. Results show that, in Upper Austria, one or seven day extreme precipitation is usually a better covariate for variations of the flood frequency curve than precipitation at longer time scales. Agricultural land-use intensification rarely is the best covariate, and the reservoir index never is, suggesting that catchment and river drivers are less important than atmospheric ones. Not all the positive flood trends correspond to a significant correlation between floods and the covariates, suggesting that other drivers or other flood-driver relations should be considered to attribute flood trends in Upper Austria.

AB In this study the suitability of precipitation waters as semi-artificial and multi-component groundwater tracers is investigated and potential applications as well as limitations are discussed. Specifically, we analyzed their migration behavior during laboratory-scale experiments with groundwater-saturated porous media. Artificially H-2- and O-18-labelled water as well as natural precipitation waters were injected into sediment-packed columns and traced via stable isotope analysis. Their migration behavior was compared to that of widely used tracers. These flow-through experiments were underpinned by a batch reactor study and by hydrogeochemical modeling. While most artificial isotope applications showed a high stability and conservative transport behavior for all tested sediments, the breakthrough curves observed in some experiments with rain and snowmelt were unsteady. This was most likely caused by the small ratio between the tracer's isotopic difference compared to the background signal and the available analytical precision. The minimum ratio required for effectively reducing uncertainties during data evaluation showed to depend significantly on experimental conditions but should not decrease below 10 during peak breakthrough and preferably be higher. Furthermore, our study illustrates that measurements based on using the precipitation waters' inherent low electrical conductivity can be significantly biased by water-sediment reactions. The batch study and reactive transport simulations confirmed this observation while revealing mineral reactions and, to a minor extent, also ion exchange as the underlying processes.

AB In this present study, a novel approach is introduced for accurate prediction of the incipient motion of uniform grain particles in sand and gravel-bedded open channels under unidirectional flow by improving Sugeno Fuzzy Inference System (Sugeno FIS). The Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) tool is based on Sugeno FIS. Consequent part of the ANFIS tool is limited to either as a constant or a linear function. This means that not only a non-linear function is available for the consequent part of the model but also it cannot be represented by the constant and linear functions, at the same time. ANFIS tool optimizes antecedent parameters (fuzzy sets) and consequent parameters (constant or linear functions) by utilizing neural and least square methods, respectively. In this study, a novel hybrid model named as Geno-Fuzzy Inference System (GENOFIS) is introduced by integrating improved Sugeno FIS and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) that refer to where, the antecedent (fuzzy sets) and consequent (constant, linear and non-linear functions) parameters are optimized using Genetic Algorithms (GAs) tool. A quantitative comparison is implemented between the ANFIS and GENOFIS models using root mean square error (RMSE) and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (CE) as evaluation criteria by using three different types of incipient motion of sediment measurements that exist in the literature as reference, visual and development of competence functions. The results of this present study demonstrated that the novel GENOFIS model provided more accurate prediction results in comparisons with the ANFIS model results for three different types of incipient motion of sediment.

AB Himalayan headwater rivers are sourced from glacier meltwater and from Indian summer monsoon (ISM) precipitation, both of which are strongly influenced by ongoing and future climate change. Hydrologic modeling studies indicate that the glacier meltwater contribution is highest during the hot, summer pre-ISM months, but this hypothesis cannot be rigorously tested due to lack of observational data. To provide new spatial and temporal constraints on water source contributions in Himalayan streams, we measured stable water isotopes (O-18/O-16 and H-2/H-1, expressed as delta O-18 and delta D) and temperature compensated electrical conductivity in nested catchments throughout the Upper Ganges Basin across three seasons: pre-ISM (April-June), ISM (July-September), post-ISM (October-December) over three years (2014-2016). For all time points we observed a sharp decrease in delta O-18 and delta D values moving toward higher elevations. To interpret these results, we tested two environmental tracer approaches for water source apportionment. Using a new isotope mixing approach, our analyses reveal large seasonal variability in water source contributions from glacier meltwater, precipitation, and groundwater to streamflow throughout the basin. Electrical conductivity, delta O-18, and deuterium excess were also analyzed through optimum multiparameter analysis (OMPA). Results from our isotope mixing model and OMPA are in close agreement. Glacier meltwater contributions were highest during the ISM and post-ISM seasons, contrary to previous model predictions. In addition to protracted release of glacier meltwater, this result is consistent with "rain-induced" glacier melting during the ISM, which we show can produce 3-11% of total discharge at the glacier snout. Glacier meltwater contributions to Himalayan streams exhibit complex seasonal dynamics; such contributions should be considered when predicting hydrologic responses to climate change in this region.

TI Assessment and modelling of uncertainty in precipitation forecasts from

AB The precipitation forecasts from numerical weather prediction have a variety of potential uses in flood forecasting and reservoir operation, but suffer from relatively poor performance due to the uncertainty of the hydrometeorological system. In this study, the control forecasts of four global weather centres were selected and assessed against the measured data using several verification metrics during the flood season (May-September) over the Shihe River catchment in the Huaihe River basin of China. The results show that the daily rainfall forecasts have low prediction ability and cannot meet the demand of reservoir regulation. To describe the uncertainty of precipitation forecasts for the safety of flood control, a new model was proposed using fuzzy probability and Bayesian theory on the basis of the generalized probability density function (GPDF). The performance of the new model is examined by using various probability measures and compared with the ensemble forecasts generated by the weather centres. It is proved that the fuzzy Bayesian model can generate the conditional probability distribution of actual precipitation from a single predicted value based on the historical observation and forecast data, and has strong generalization ability. Compared with the ensemble forecasts, although the fuzzy Bayesian model shows a slightly improvement in accuracy, it has better performance in sharpness and reliability. Meanwhile, the new model is easy to update with new samples by modifying its likelihood function, which is favourable for real-time reservoir regulation. In addition, the uncertainty of the precipitation forecast was analysed with the model in different lead times. Generally, the uncertainty increases with the growth of lead time, and the probability distribution of the rainfall forecast within 3 days is an acceptable result for a risk and benefit analysis of the flood control system. To be more specific, a fuzzy Bayesian model based on the GPDF is an efficient way to generate the probability distribution of the precipitation with forecast data for the uncertainty analysis, and makes it possible to provide a reference for reservoir managers to plan regulation strategies with a lead time of at least 3 days.

AB Water quality is a sensitive topic of worldwide concern that is defined by a series of physical, chemical and biological characteristics. The complex nature for studying water quality requires finding simple models to identify the variables that influence it the most. Therefore, the use of multivariate analysis techniques will be of immense help to find relationships and conclusions which aid us to determine the state of water quality through biological, physical and chemical indicators. In this investigation, the following variables were evaluated: Temperature, pH, transparency, turbidity, nitrates, orthophosphates, phosphorus, total nitrogen, chlorophyll a, solar radiation, dissolved oxygen and microcystins. These determined water quality at the sample sites, Gamboa and Paraiso. The results obtained through the application of a two-way multivariate analysis method called HJ-Biplot reflect variables relationships of chemical, physical and biological compositions. Furthermore, results conform two clusters of sample points that satisfactorily match to the region seasons. Cluster 1 is characterized by the presence of the following variables: pH, transparency, chlorophyll a, oxygen and temperature. On the other hand, cluster 2 comprises the following variables: nitrate, orthophosphates, turbidity and P-total. They are all parameters that suffer variations in the rainy season, and that, in turn, can influence the presence of ciabobacteria with toxigenic potential. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the multivariate statistical methods are valuable for interpreting complex data sets, specifically, for water quality monitoring network.

AB Lake level regulation is commonly used to manage water resources and mitigate flood risk in watersheds with linked river-lake systems. In this study, we first assess exposure, in terms of both population and land area, to flooding impacts in the Yahara Watershed's chain of four lakes in southern Wisconsin as affected by minimum lake level management. A flooding exposure assessment shows that the areas surrounding the upstream lakes, Mendota and Monona, have dense urban areas with high populations that are exposed to flooding; Waubesa has low elevations along its lakeshore, resulting in a large potential flooding area; and the most downstream lake, Kegonsa, has a large area of surrounding cropland that is exposed to flooding but impacts a limited population. We then use a linked modeling framework of a land surface model (Agro-IBIS) and a hydrologic-routing model (THMB) to simulate daily lake level over a study period of 1994-2013 in the Yahara Watershed with different minimum lake level management strategies. Modeling results show that the peak lake levels and corresponding exposed land area and population to flooding will decrease under a lower target minimum lake level. However, at the same time, the number of days that the lake level is below winter minimum will increase, which may adversely affect ecosystem health. In addition, our sensitivity analysis indicates that reducing target minimum lake levels will help mitigate flood risk in terms of both flood magnitude and frequency. Nevertheless, this must be balanced against the need to maintain adequately high lake levels for ecosystem services and recreational functions of the lakes.

AB Snow avalanches are among the most destructive natural hazards threatening human life, ecosystems, built structures, and landscapes in mountainous regions. The complexity of snow avalanche modelling has been discussed in many studies, but its modelling is not well-documented. Snow avalanche modeling in this study was done using three main categories of data, including avalanche occurrence locations, meteorological factors, and terrain characteristics. Two machine learning models, namely support vector machine (SVM) and multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA), were employed. A ratio of 70 to 30 of data was considered for calibrating and validating the models. Results indicated that both models had an excellent performance in snow avalanche modeling (area under curve, AUC > 90), although hits and misses analysis demonstrated the superior performance of MDA. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the topographic position index, slope, precipitation, and topographic wetness index were the most effective variables for modeling. A snow avalanche map indicated that the high snow avalanche hazard zone was mostly near the streams and was matched with hillsides around the water pathways. Findings of study can be helpful for land use planning, to control snow avalanche paths, and to prevent the probable hazards induced by it, and it can be a good reference for future studies on modeling snow avalanche hazards.

AB The availability of Quebec (Canada) river temperature data has improved significantly in recent years, with increased monitoring effort and sharing of existing data. Although it is now recognized that this variable is of central interest in a variety of instream habitat issues, the actual interpretation and use of the data by managers and researchers can be challenging, due to the spatial sparsity of the measurement sites and to the unevenness of the length of the temperature time series. In this paper, we propose a model for all Quebec rivers thermal regimes, as a means to interpret and exploit the available river temperature data. The model, based on fitting a Gaussian function to time series of interannual mean daily temperatures, was used to characterize the thermal regime at more than 400 locations in Quebec rivers. The three parameters of the model (annual maximum, date of annual maximum and length of the warm season) allowed to produce a first map of Quebec river thermal regimes. A method to quantify the uncertainty on the parameters estimation, taking into account the length of the time series and the interannual variability of the river temperature, is presented. Finally, stepwise regressions were used to investigate the relationships between the model parameters and the physioclimatic characteristics of the basins upstream of the measurement sites.

AB The Kinematic Wave Model (KWM), representing a simplification of the Full Wave Model (FWM) under the shallow-water approximation, is often used in the one-dimensional formulation for describing the dynamics of debris/mud flood. The present work investigates the applicability conditions of the KWM to analyze mud floods, characterized by a rheological behaviour expressed through a power-law model. The study is carried out through the numerical solution of both the Full and Kinematic Wave models changing the characteristic time of hydrograph, i.e. the wave duration, imposed at the channel inlet. The predictions of the two models are compared in terms of maximum flow depth, maximum discharge and peak discharge at the downstream channel end. The study is performed for several values of the Froude (F) and the Kinematic Wave (K) numbers. Similarly to the clear-water case, present results show that higher errors in applying KWM pertain to shorter flood wave durations, but the performance of KWM appears to strongly depend on the value of the rheological index, becoming worse as the fluid rheology becomes more shear-thinning. The study furnishes applicability criteria representing a guideline for practical applications in terms of minimum wave duration above which the KWM error in reproducing the considered flood characteristics (the maximum flow depth, the maximum discharge and the peak discharge at the downstream channel end) is less or equal than 5%. Finally, it has been shown that the wave period criterion, obtained considering linearized wave dynamics, may be safely applied at least for fluid with moderate shear-thinning behavior and for moderate values of the dimensionless number KF2.

AB Fecal contamination poses a threat to groundwater supplies in low income regions. This is often due to the coexistence of pit latrines with domestic wells in densely populated areas. In this context, developing alternative methodologies to map fecal pollution in shallow wells is needed. A thorough survey of over 240 domestic wells and 570 pit latrines was conducted in a rural town of southern Mali. Water samples were collected from all wells and tested for temperature, pH, electric conductivity, total dissolved solids, turbidity and thermotolerant coliforms. The outcomes of the field survey were incorporated into a GIS database. Thirteen machine leaning classifiers, including different statistical algorithms, instance-based learners and tree-based models, were used to determine the spatial distribution of fecal pollution as per five explanatory variables (latrine density, distance to the closest latrine, borehole yield, water table depth and population density). The best performing classifiers, selected on test scores, were then used to develop predictive maps. Random forest and logistic regression rendered prediction scores for fecal pollution in excess of 0.90. Multilayer perceptrons, support vector machines and quadratic discriminant analyses also proved adept at forecasting fecal pollution. Ensemble mapping shows that 30-50 m buffers around domestic wells may be sufficient to prevent contamination of domestic supplies in most instances. This demonstrates that machine learning may provide a versatile methodological alternative to traditional Darcian approaches. On the other hand, the practical difficulties involved in maintaining wellhead protection areas suggests the need to implement piped water supplies.

AB In this study, three single Artificial Intelligence (AI) based models i.e., Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a linear Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model as well as three different ensemble techniques i.e., Simple average ensemble (SAE), weighted average ensemble (WAE) and neural network ensemble (NNE) are applied for single and multi-step ahead modeling of dissolve oxygen (DO) in the Yamuna River, India. In this context, DO, Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Discharge (Q), pH, Ammonia (NH3), Water Temperature (WT) data for three different stations i.e., Hathnikund (SL1), Nizamuddin (SL2) and Udi (SL3) recorded by central pollution control board were used. The performance accuracy of the models was determined using Determination Coefficient (DC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The obtained results of the single models showed that, ANFIS model outperformed all other three models and increased averagely up to 7% and 19% for SL1 and SL2 in performance accuracy while for SL3, SVM model performed better than other models and increased the average performance up to 16%. In the ensemble techniques, the results showed that, for all the three stations, NNE could increase the average performance by single models up to 14% in the verification phase. This justified the reliability and robustness of NNE in multi-step ahead modeling of DO due to its promising ability in solving nonlinear processes.

AB Frequent droughts in a warming climate may exert more negative influences on ecosystems. Unlike previous studies that have investigated the vegetation response to drought generally in a deterministic way, a copula-based model is developed for quantifying drought impacts on terrestrial vegetation and identifying drought-vulnerable regions for mainland China from a probabilistic perspective in this study. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is firstly correlated with the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at varying timescales from 1 month to 24 months to determine the response time of vegetation to water variability. Then, the dependence structure of vegetation vigor and water availability is modeled through the bivariate copula analysis. Furthermore, conditional probabilities of vegetation decline under moderate, severe and extreme drought scenarios are systematically estimated using copula-based conditional probability distributions. Results indicate that spatial patterns of vegetation response time present distinct seasonality, with faster response to water variation in the southern part than in the northern proportion of mainland China during the non-growing season while the inverse pattern is observed for the growing season. The higher conditional probabilities of the below-average vegetation status in the dry condition evidence that water deficits overwhelming water surplus play a more profound role in diminishing vegetation vigor across more than 80% of mainland China. Specifically, when moderate droughts develop into extreme ones, the average probability of vegetation status below the 50th percentile escalates by 6.9%. Moreover, extreme droughts are noted to exaggerate probabilities of vegetation activity falling below the increasingly lower (40th, 30th, 20th and 10th) percentiles by 8.8%, 10.8%, 12.7% and 13.7% in comparison with moderate counterparts, thereby suggesting higher likelihood of the deteriorating drought conditions inducing vegetation losses, especially major vegetation decline. As for the drought-vulnerable region, North China, particularly the central Inner Mongolia, is recognized with vegetation decline probabilities being 28.1% and 68.8% greater than the mainland average given drought conditions (quantified as SPEI <= -1), respectively. Results of the study may improve our understanding of climatic extreme influence on vegetation status and benefit the effective drought preparedness and mitigation.

AB Accurate estimation of mean flow velocity is imperative for the prediction of hydrographs and sediment yield. The Chezy and Manning equations are the most widely used for calculating flow velocity in runoff and erosion models. The suitability of both equations for overland flow on bare land has been evaluated, and conflicting results were obtained in previous studies. The suitability of these equations for overland flow on a planted slope requires further investigation. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the suitability of the Chezy and Manning equations under planted conditions and evaluate quantitative effect of vegetation on Manning's n and then on flow velocity. Flume experiments were conducted at the plant basal cover ranging from 0 to 30%, slope gradient varying from 8.8% to 25.9%, and flow discharge ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 x 10(-3) m(3) s(-1). The flow depth and flow velocity were measured. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) were used to compare the performance accuracy of both equations. The results showed that both equations provided a bad accuracy when plant basal cover was greater than 15% on a planted slope. The NSE values were negative for Manning equation and close to 0 for Chezy equation. It indicates that Manning and Chezy equations were not suitable for the planted slope. Manning's n decreased with the flow depth for 0% plant basal cover and increased with flow depth for plant basal cover greater than 1.25%. Thus a new equation for calculating Manning's n was developed based on plant basal cover and flow depth and was used in the Manning equation. The new flow velocity equation including plant basal cover provided satisfactory accuracy with a NSE of 0.995. The results indicate that the Manning's n was significantly affected by flow depth and plant basal cover.

AB Due to the increasing need of human societies and diverse biological species for adequate and reliable water resources, river basins play an important role in reliable water supply. A comprehensive index for assessing the performance of river basins can prevent unintentional events by accurately identifying vulnerabilities and threats. In the present study, comprehensive risk assessment of a river basin is carried out using Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) to determine the undesirable events. The FTA method, based on a logical diagram, reveals the relationships of basic events and the top event by logical gates and is capable of providing quantitative and qualitative analysis of the river basin. It can show the failure paths and calculates the degree of basins' reliability. In this study, undesirable ecological status, low quality and scarcity of water resources, and economic and social anomalies were studied as unfavorable events of the Urmia Lake Basin. To do this, an FTA model is presented in which "Water Resources Failure Risk of Urmia Lake Basin" is the top event. The probability of occurrence of basic events and top event was calculated based on the information available for the area and using experts' opinions. The results of the study show that quality failure have the most impact on top event occurrence. The effective basic events in the occurrence of the top event are "Inappropriate governance", "low awareness level", "Entrance of industrial and domestic wastewater to groundwater", "Entrance of agricultural wastewater to groundwater", and "Meteorological drought", respectively. The index derived from the FTA can provide water resources managers and decision makers with comprehensive measure to improve and compare the status of internal and external effective factors in river basins.

AB The skin effect is an important issue associated with a loss of hydraulic efficiency in pumping systems. In this paper, a comprehensive study is conducted to determine how the evolution of the skin effect over time affects the productivity and functionality of brine exploitation systems in a crystalline halite aquifer. Several double-packer system tests have been interpreted via groundwater modeling to hydrogeologically characterize the investigated aquifer. A numerical groundwater flow model that accounts for the heterogeneity of the multilayer halite aquifer and the transient well skin effect on the brine exploitation system is presented to explain the continuous drawdown during three months of constant-rate brine extractions. Numerical results obtained suggested that an exponential decay function of permeability over time was required in a wellbore skin zone to reproduce numerically experimental observations during brine exploitation. The empirical exponential function obtained specifically for this case study was generalized, and coefficients considered were discussed to infer their physical and geochemical dimensions related to the mixing process triggering heterogenous reactions responsible for the hydraulic loses. Our results will be useful for predicting the spatial and temporal losses of hydraulic efficiency and for evaluating the lifetimes of brine exploitation infrastructure.

AB The aim of the study was the comparison of the soil hydraulic properties determined based on two different experimental methods of four large and macroporous soil samples. An undisturbed cylindrical soil column (h = 60 cm and d = 30 cm) was obtained at a natural slope and quartered horizontally in the laboratory. The four sub-samples were saturated and subsequently drained using the extended multi-step outflow method (XMSO). Retention curves and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curves were derived via inverse modeling based on the measured drainage and corresponding pore water pressure. After resaturation the evaporation method (EVA) was used on the same four samples. The samples were exposed to evaporation and the effective water contents and the average pore water pressures were recorded over time to determine soil hydraulic functions.
   While both methods yielded similar results in the medium moisture range, the advantage of the XMSO-method is its higher information content with respect to the hydraulic conductivity close to water saturation whereas the advantage of the EVA-method is its fast execution. Moreover, the EVA-method is easier to handle and has significantly lower computational requirements than the XMSO-method.
   Furthermore, since the four soil samples represent a soil profile in the field, a depth dependent characterizing of the soil profile was possible and showed that the soil properties near saturation are greatly dominated by the ratio of macropores in the sample and that a decrease in the macropore ratio with soil depth was clearly reflected in the hydraulic functions.

AB Climate and land use change are the two primary factors that affect different components of hydrological cycle as well as sediment transport in the watershed. Quantifying potential impact of these two stressors enables decision makers to formulate better water resource management strategies to adapt to the changing environment. To that end, we have developed an integrated modeling framework employing an Agent-based approach to simulate land use conversion that then serves as input to the Soil and Water Assessment tool (SWAT) in a loosely coupled fashion. The modeling framework was tested on the Neshanic River Watershed (NRW), 142 km(2) area in central New Jersey that contains mix of urban, agricultural and forested lands. An ensemble of 10 different global climate models (GCMs) for two different greenhouse gas emission scenarios including representative concentration pathways-4.5 and 8.5 (RCP-4.5 and 8.5) were employed to model future climate from 2020 to 2045. Land use conversion for 2040 was developed based on six driving factors including distance to residential lands, agricultural lands, roads, streams, train stations, and forest using three land use transition potential models and further, the best transition potential model accompanied with some local land use restrictions.
   The study evaluated various components of hydrological cycle and sediment transport for the three different scenarios one-at-a-time including climate change alone, land use change alone, and combined climate and land use change. Results indicate that the changing climate will have a larger effect on the hydrologic cycle than intensifying urban land uses in the study watershed. The climate change scenarios, either alone or in composite with land use change, predict higher streamflow (32% and 36% increase over baseline, respectively), overriding the effect of land use change which predicts a decline of 5% in streamflow. The increase in streamflow results in an increase in sediment loading, presumably due to an increase stream downcutting. Conversely, the effect of land use change (in this case the conversion of agricultural land to low density residential uses), is predicted to decrease sediment load. When modelled in composite, the effect of changing land use (in this case the conversion of erodible agricultural fields to suburban development) appears to override the adverse effect of climate change, enhancing watershed resiliency by reducing sediment load and thereby improving health of the downstream aquatic ecosystems.

AB This study proposes a method for improving the capability of rainfall and flood forecasts by generating ensemble precipitation predictions (EPPs) associated with radar-based rainfall prediction by considering spatial rainfall errors. The EPPs are generated as a kind of Monte-Carlo simulation based on the performance of the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model in the previous time step window. The generated EPPs continue to be blended with radar-based rainfall predictions to produce hybrid rainfall forecasts that perform better than each system could perform individually. The hybrid forecasts are then adjusted by reducing the spatial rainfall errors, which have considerable contributions to the accuracy of the flood forecasts. To validate the performance of the proposed method, this method was applied to improve the capability of the coupled Local Data Assimilation and Prediction system (LDAPS) and Sejong University Rainfall - Runoff (SURR) model for rainfall and flood forecasts during two flood events that occurred in 2013 and 2016 in the Yeongwol watershed. EPPs were generated from the deterministic LDAPS rainfall events and were then blended with the McGill algorithm for precipitation nowcasting by Lagrangian extrapolation (MAPLE) rainfall predictions to produce hybrid rainfall forecasts. Each ensemble member of the hybrid model was then corrected before it was forced as an input for the SURR model to obtain ensemble streamflow predictions. The results showed that the capability of the coupled model was improved sustainably step by step and exhibited the best skills after applying the final step. For rainfall forecasts, the proportion correct (PC), root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (CC), and Brier score (BS) were improved dramatically by 59%, 32%, 32% and 48% for flood events in 2013 and by 39%, 15%, 33% and 37% for flood events in 2016, respectively. For flood forecasting, the Nash - Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and absolute relative error in volume (AREV) were improved substantially by 63% and 24% for flood events in 2013 and by 42% and 53% for flood events in 2016, respectively. The success of this case study proved the viability of the method proposed in this study.

AB Urban areas are often covered by materials with smooth ground surface and poor water permeability, which may cause problems such as increasing flow velocity and discharge.
   This study employed the diffusion wave equation to investigate the variation of overland flow, and analytical solutions were obtained by the generalized integral transformation technique. Examining previous research, we found when the coefficients in the diffusion wave equation were treated as constants, the simulated results would be mass non-conservative. This study corrected the coefficients which makes the flow meet the mass conservation law to improve the simulation results. An alternative solution to the overland flow considering time-varying rainfall and infiltration were proposed and the results were well compared with previous numerical solutions and experimental data.

AB A robust hydrological modeling at a fine spatial resolution is a vital tool for Norway to simulate river discharges and hydrological components for climate adaptation strategies. However, it requires improvements of modelling methods, detailed observational data as input and expensive computational resources. This work aims to set up a distributed version of the HBV model with a physically based evapotranspiration scheme at 1 km resolution for mainland Norway and to calibrate/validate the model for 124 catchments using regionalized parameterizations. The Penman-Monteith equation was implemented in the HBV model and vegetation characteristics were derived from the Norwegian forest inventory combined with multi-source remote sensing data at 16 m spatial resolution. The estimated potential evapotranspiration (Ep) was compared with pan measurements and estimates from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MOD16) products, the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) and Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model. There are 5 climatic zones in Norway classified based on 4 temperature and precipitation indices. For each zone, the model was calibrated separately by optimizing a multi-objective function including the Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (NSE) and biases of selected catchments. In total, there are 85 catchments for calibration and 39 for validation. The Ep estimates showed good agreement with the measurements, GLEAM and VIC outputs. However, the MOD16 product significantly overestimates Ep compared to the other products. The discharge was well reproduced with the median daily NSE of 0.68/0.67, bias of -3%/ -1%, Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.70/0.69 and monthly NSE of 0.80/0.78 in the calibration/validation periods. Our results showed a significant improvement compared to the previous HBV application for all catchments, with an increase of 0.08-0.16 in the median values of the daily NSE, KGE and monthly NSE. Both the temporal and spatial transferability of model parameterizations were also enhanced compared to the previous application.

AB The severity of river eutrophication is influenced by multiple stressors which reflect a wide-ranging variety of drivers encompassing land management, population growth and climatic effects. Experimental studies have successfully identified response to single or paired stressors under controlled conditions in small streams but have limited capability to characterise larger systems influenced by a wider variety of stressors. Here, a physics-based water quality model of the River Thames (UK) is used to explore the impacts of water temperature, phosphate concentration, river flow, urbanisation and riparian shading on indicators of chlorophyll and dissolved oxygen concentration by way of a sensitivity analysis. To understand the impact of model structural uncertainty, results are presented from two alternative formulations of the biological response. All outputs from each unique combination of stressors are presented in one graphic comprising multiple sub-plots that display the results of thousands of model runs simultaneously. Consequently, graphical analysis allows us to pinpoint under what circumstances reductions in key variables representing management-related stressors (i.e. lowering phosphorus concentrations and establishing riparian shading) may act synergistically, antagonistically or simply in an additive manner. Furthermore, we identify how these relationships may vary under different river flow and water temperature regimes and changes in abstraction and effluent discharge rates, to indicate the likely influence of future climate and population growth. Response can vary markedly depending on the choice of biological model and also changes considerably downstream along the river system. Chlorophyll indicators consistently show antagonistic responses to reduction in stressors whereas dissolved oxygen indicators show varied and complex responses. As expected, increases in phosphorus loading are detrimental, but so too are large decreases. Whilst the analysis suggests that urbanisation impacts are in general not expected to be large, changes in water demand brought about by population growth have disproportionate effects at low flows. These may result in increased incidence of very low dissolved oxygen concentrations which damage the health of the ecosystem.

AB Ecosystem protection requires a better definition of groundwater (GW) dependence and tools to measure this dependence. In this study, a classification method for the GW dependence of headwater streams was devised based on the fact that GW affects discharge, thermal regime, and water quality. The method was tested in three boreal headwater streams discharging from two esker aquifers. Spatial and temporal variability of GW dependence were studied in the stream continuum at several locations, by combining continuous measurements of temperature, electrical conductivity, and discharge with discrete sampling of environmental tracers (e.g., stable water isotopes, silica, chloride). The stream tracer index method developed was used to classify stream sections into GW-dominated, GW-surface water (SW) transition, and SW-dominated zones. We found that, spatially, GW dependence along the stream varied widely, with calculated stream tracer index values ranging from 33 to 94%. The GW-dominated areas extended at least 745, 1 682, and 4 202 m downstream from the main GW discharge points in the three streams studied. A stream located in a pristine peatland-dominated catchment was more prone to rapid change from GW- to SW-dominated than two streams located in catchments dominated by peatland forestry. These results suggest that to evaluate the GW dependence of streams, it may be sufficient to sample stream sections only once, during summer low-flow conditions. The proposed method can serve as a water management tool, especially for streams of exceptional ecological importance or in places where anthropogenic activities are expected to change local hydrology and ecology.

AB An exact analytical solution for one-dimensional fluid flow through rock matrix block is presented. The non linearity induced from flow functions makes the governing equations describing this mechanism difficult to be analytically solved. In this paper, an analytical solution to the infiltration problems considering non-linear relative permeability functions is presented for finite depth, despite its profound and fundamental importance. Elimination of the nonlinear terms in the equation, as a complex and tedious task, is done by applying several successive mathematical manipulations including: Hopf-Cole transformation to obtain a diffusive type PDE; an exponential type transformation to get a convective-diffusive type PDE with suitable boundary conditions; Laplace transformation; Integral transformation to homogenize the boundary condition in the Laplace domain; and finally Laplace inversion method to find the time domain solution. The obtained solution is used for developing a new matrix-fracture transfer function. The developed analytical equations are used for prediction of drying front in the case of evaporation from deep water table. The model results are in close agreement with the experimental data and numerical simulation of the process. Results of sensitivity analysis of different parameters on recovery rate and ultimate production based on design of experiment method are also discussed.

AB A reservoir operation chart is effective in guiding the actual operation of reservoirs. With the development and construction of large-scale mixed reservoirs, operating reservoirs using multiple objective operations has become a hot issue. This study, therefore, improved and expanded the traditional energy storage operation chart (ESOC) model for pure cascade reservoirs based to the special relationships between hydraulics and water volume of the upstream and downstream reservoirs in a mixed reservoir system. Considering the objectives of flood control, energy generation (including power generation, guaranteed output, and assurance rate), and ecological flow, a multi-objective ESOC optimization model for large-scale mixed reservoirs is established, and the corresponding solving method for this model is proposed. Taking the Pearl river basin of China as an example, the multi objective Pareto fronts of different minimum discharges of upstream reservoirs are obtained. According to the actual operation demands and constraints, the optimal multi-objective schemes under different assurance rates and different ecological flow satisfaction rates are extracted based on the obtained Pareto fronts. For example, if the assurance rate of power generation is required to be equal to or greater than 90% and the ecological flow, the satisfaction rate of downstream control sections is required to be equal to or greater than 0.97, the scheme is the best when the minimum discharge of upstream reservoirs is 300 m(3)/s, and the corresponding power generation and guaranteed output are 58.989 x 10(8) kWh and 439 GW, respectively. On the whole, the proposed models and related results have significance for the actual operation of large-scale mixed reservoirs.

At a given time step, the inverse method imposes continuities of concentration and total solute mass flux at a set of collocation points in the inversion grid, whereas the LAS are conditioned to measured breakthrough concentrations. By enforcing transport physics at selected points in space and time, the inverse problem becomes well-posed and a single system of inversion equations is assembled and solved with a parallel iterative solver. Unlike most of the inversion techniques that minimize a model-data mismatch objective function, the inverse method does not require the simulation of a forward transport model for optimization, thus both solute initial and boundary conditions can be recovered. Assuming dispersivity estimates are available, the method was demonstrated using synthetic breakthrough data from various sampling densities and designs, i.e., irregular versus uniformly spaced well networks. Different measurement errors and source release histories (e.g., uniform-in-time, single, and multiple pulses) were also investigated. Results suggest that for the source release histories tested, 1) inversion is stable under increasing measurement errors up to 5% of the maximum observed concentration; 2) accurate plume trajectory and source release location can be estimated from solute breakthrough concentrations; 3) inversion accuracy appears the most sensitive to sampling well density and its information content.

AB Water-sediment regulation (WSR) is an effective non-engineering measure to alleviate the problem of suspended river and bring benefit to flood control security in sediment-laden river. However, WSR may decrease the socioeconomic benefit of reservoirs, for example, reduction of hydropower production and water supply. In order to satisfy the practical requirement of WSR and other utilization objectives, this paper presents a multi-objective operation model for a cascade reservoirs simultaneously considering the maximization water volume for WSR and power generation and water supply, as well as various complex constraints. Then, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) is improved to solve the aforementioned model and key control indicators of WSR are analyzed. Meanwhile, a sediment transport model has been introduced to quantify the effect of WSR. The models are applied to the cascade reservoirs in the Upper Yellow River. The following conclusion can be drawn from results (1) Pareto fronts of the model solution demonstrate a strong competition between WSR and water supply, water supply and power generation, a low sensitivity between WSR and power generation; (2) the ability of WSR in Upper Yellow River is 6 times in 24 years, which means the frequency of WSR is four years averagely; (3) 233.77 million tons of sediments are transported by long-term WSR in the Ningxia-Inner Mongolia reaches, account for 19.10% of sediment deposition; (4) the risk-free conditions of LYX and LJX reservoirs' water volume for WSR are 137.42 x 10(8) m(8) and 41.08 x 10(8) m(8), respectively, which could be used as a reference in actual operation. The research results have an important practical significance and application for sediment control and governance of suspended river, and the multi-objective operation model of WSR proposed in this study can be effectively and suitably used in sediment regulation with similar conditions.

AB This study describes immiscible fluid displacement near a transitional boundary at which inertial effect occurs. We simulated two-phase fluid flow in a 2D micromodel using the lattice Boltzmann method with varying Reynolds numbers (Re) (log Re = -2 to 2) and viscosity ratios (M) (log M = -2 to 0). To highlight the role of inertial force rather than capillary and viscous forces, the capillary number (Ca) was kept constant at log Ca = -5. As Re and M increased, development in the preferential flow became more pronounced with tortuous paths. We found the transitional boundary exists near log Re = -1 to 1 at which residual saturation of the displaced fluid starts to fluctuate and changes 5%-14% in the transitional regime. In particular, this boundary describes the effect of inertia on immiscible fluid displacement before an increase in the work done due to inertial force occurs.

AB Atmospheric and streamflow drought back to 1600 were reconstructed with provenance-verified regional Pinus-sylvestris and Pinus-nigra chronologies of earlywood, latewood and ring width, detrended by signal-free regional curve standardization, from the Weinviertel, a dry region in Eastern Austria. Linear regression models with Weinviertel latewood indices as predictor variables were used to estimate regional April August precipitation totals (R-2 = 0.47) and seven-day minimum flow from May to October (best fit: R-2 = 0.65). As a novelty, the well-known dendrochronology quality measure "Expressed Population Signal" in a modified version is used to define a scaling factor for empirically estimating the reconstructions' time-varying reliability.
   For the detection of drought years in the reconstructed time series, four stages of drought of increasing intensity were defined as conditions below median, and below the 33rd, 20th, and 5th percentile-representing 2-year, 3-year, 5-year and 20-year recurrence intervals.
   The method for the extension of time series of low flows into the past is applicable in the Weinviertel and can be a useful source of historical hydrological and meteorological information restricted by the uncertainties coming along with proxy records. Of the analyzed period back to 1600, the 19th century is the driest one closely followed by the 18th century, sharing the overall driest period from 1775 to 1813. The phase with the longest continuous atmospheric dry period is 1807-1811. The longest hydrological drought lasted from 1832 to 1839.

AB Situational awareness in sanitary sewer systems requires accurate flow information at different spatial locations in a city. It is especially desirable to predict flows across a wastewater network in response to heavy rainfall events in addition to regular consumption patterns. Typically, complicated hydraulic models that suffer from difficulties in parameter identification and high computational burden are used for flow prediction. Recently, data-driven approaches have been employed for flow prediction. In this paper, we first design and then compare the performance of three data-driven methods to predict flow: (1) Artificial Neural Network (ANN); (2) Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM); (3) Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). We test the performance of these machine and statistical learning techniques using data gathered from the City of Springfield. While, all three data-driven methodologies provide acceptable prediction performance, we observe that LSTM outperforms ANN due to the inherent memory integrated with a feedback structure. The statistical learning approach, i.e., LASSO regression not only offers good prediction performance, but also helps identify the key spatial and temporal features that influence flow at any specific location. This added information could aid in remediation activities. Another key contribution of this paper is that we quantify the value of groundwater data in flow prediction. Specifically, including groundwater data as an additional input enhances flow prediction performance in all three methods. Lastly, to better predict flows corresponding to rare events (e.g., 50 or 100 year rainfall events) we use a resampling approach (known as SmoteR) to modify the training dataset. Simulation results indicate that the resampling technique is effective in improving prediction performance.

AB In this study, we proposed a hybrid approach combining the standard FAO-56 method with the complementary principle of evapotranspiration (ET) to predict actual ET (ETa) on a rainfed crop field. A generalized complementary relationship (GCR) was employed to quantify the water stress coefficient (K-s) for the FAO-56 method with no use of soil moisture data. Then, the K-s values were multiplied to the crop ET (ETc) estimated with the corrected air temperatures for the assumption of adequate land-surface moisture. The proposed hybrid method applied to a rotational maize-soybean field where an eddy-covariance flux tower was installed. Results showed that the reference ET (ETo) estimated by the corrected temperatures was within a range of 89-95% of that from non-corrected ones, implying that ETo could be inflated when using the mean air temperatures measured under sub-humid conditions. The K-s values estimated by GCR showed consistent patterns with temporal rainfall variation on the field. The multiplication of the K-s from GCR and ETc showed higher performance in ETa prediction than when the GCR was solely applied. By inverting the hybrid approach, a local crop coefficient curve for the rainfed maize field was developed, and led to further improvement in ETa prediction. This study suggests that combination of the complementary principle and the FAO-standard method, which are seemingly in separate paradigms, may improve ETa prediction on crop fields.

AB This study introduces a novel hydrological assessment tool (HAT) based on hybrid machine learning (HML) framework. The HML framework combines an unsupervised clustering technique and a supervised classification technique, to determine reasonable performance ratings (unsatisfactory, satisfactory, good, and very good) and build a practical assessment tool. Hydrologically significant error indices are used to cluster the performance rating groups and train the HAT. The HAT was applied to the National Water Model (NWM), which is operated in real time for the continental United States (CONUS). For establishing, training, and validating the HAT, data from October 2013 to February 2017 were used, and a performance assessment was conducted on the NWM in the San Francisco Bay Area. As a result, the HAT determined the performance ratings that were reliable in terms of the statistics and hydrograph. It was confirmed that the HAT could perform an accurate hydrograph assessment as the concordance rate of the performance ratings was 98%. The NWM was evaluated against 57 USGS streamflow gauges using the HAT and was found to perform with 46% on average, good and very good ratings. The HML framework, an integral part of the HAT, is expected to be useful not only in hydrological analysis but also across all geophysical fields that deal with physical processes.

AB Little is known about the contribution of bedload flux to the total sediment load exported from tropical sand-bed rivers. Yet, predicting bedload transport rates contributes to better river management, more appropriate river engineering works design, accurate knowledge of sediment delivery rates, which greatly benefits sediment related water resources management. Therefore, bedload, suspended load and runoff discharge were measured at the lower Gilgel Abay River in the Blue Nile catchment of Ethiopia. Catchment area is 3887 km(2), average stream discharge in the rainy season 315 (+/- 164) m(3) s(-1), and the stream surface gradient at the sampling station 0.0007 m m(-1). A standard Helley-Smith (U.S. BL-84) cable-suspended sampler was used to take 315 samples to measure bedload fluxes for the 2017 rainy season. The bedload predominantly comprises well to moderately well sorted, medium-sized sand (250-500 mu m) with a symmetric and leptokurtic distribution. The mean daily observed bedload discharge varies from 0.7 to 427.5 Mg d(-1) with an average rate of 175.1 Mg d(-1). Field observations also show that the bedload dynamics become larger near the river banks and decrease towards the middle of the river section due to the presence of a central bridge pier. The average suspended sediment load ranges from 247 to 220,028 Mg d(-1) and dominates the total sediment yield ( > 94.6%). The bedload accounts for only 0.1 to 5.4% of the total sediment load. The area-specific bedload and suspended load are also 0.6 and 22 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) respectively. The elongated planform growth of the Gilgel Abay River delta in Lake Tana is also in line with the predominance of very fine, suspended load in the sediment transport of this river, in addition to limited alongshore drifting given the low waves of Tana lake. Among the tested bedload prediction criteria, the stream-power based equations of Martin and modified Bagnold performed better. Yet, the bedload prediction performance of simple power regression equations based on runoff discharge and excess unit stream power parameters provided the best agreement with the observed bedload data (Adj. R-2 0.82-0.87). Finally, this study provides plausible estimates of bedload fluxes that are within predicted ranges reported for sand-bed rivers in Africa and other tropical regions.

AB Rapid economic development and population growth in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin makes it imperative for water resources to be used fairly and efficiently among all stakeholders. This paper proposes an integrated model framework to assess the water benefits sharing schemes among the five stakeholders in the basin, namely, China, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Three objectives are considered for this assessment-hydropower (HP), eco-index (EI), and agricultural water use (AW). The hydrologic model, optimization model, and cooperative game theory methods are jointly used to analyze the water benefits of stakeholders under different scenarios. According to the model, cooperation can bring more incremental benefits in dry years when water resources are scarce. Three cooperative game theoretical methods, namely, the Shapley value, the Gately point, and the Nash-Harsanyi solution, are employed to find the possible benefit sharing solutions. The results show that China and Laos need to operate their reservoirs for downstream countries' beneficial uses under cooperation, and thus, compensation by reallocating the incremental benefit from cooperation is necessary no matter which method is used. It is found that all of the future damming plans would enhance the basin-level cooperation in most cases. In particular, according to the analysis, damming in the basins of the Sesan, Srepok, and Sekong rivers would have more effect than damming in the upper Lancang-Mekong River Basin after 2030. Based on some verified assumptions, the results of this paper can offer real-world preferences, but the uncertainties need to be further explored.

ID DECISION-MAKING; GENERATION; ALGORITHM
AB Streamflow scenario tree reduction is essential for alleviating the computational burden of a stochastic programming with recourse model. This paper develops a new streamflow scenario tree reduction method aimed at preserving important statistical moment information and maintaining streamflow scenario probability. Specifically, we first employ a neural gas algorithm for scenario tree generation, then establish a stepwise conditional Monte Carlo sampling method for systemically reducing the number of scenarios from the full tree. We then develop a regularized optimization model based on ridge regression and moment matching to determine the posterior scenario probability. We apply the proposed method to the Qingjiang cascade reservoir system in China. The results show that the reduced tree with 35% reduction level can still maintain robust moment preservations, including the mean, variance, lag-one covariance, cross-site covariance, and scenario probability. Additionally, the stability test indicates that the proposed conditional Monte Carlo sampling method is stable and converges within a reasonable number of scenario combinations.

AB Single-well push-pull (SWPP) test is one of the most important ways to estimate flow and transport parameters, e.g. porosity, dispersivity, regional groundwater flow velocity. Usually the wellbore is surrounded by a finite-thickness skin, such as a gravel pack. The positive skin has a smaller hydraulic conductivity than the aquifer formation zone, and the negative skin has a greater one. In this study, a numerical model of a SWPP test considering skin effects was established using the finite-element COMSOL Multiphysics program to estimate aquifer parameters. Several important results were obtained. Firstly, regional groundwater velocity affects the types of breakthrough curves (BTCs) through changing the flow pattern. Secondly, a positive (or negative) skin leads to a slower (or faster) tracer transport process, and a smaller ratio between the hydraulic conductivity of the skin and that of the aquifer formation zone results in greater solute plume retardation in the skin zone. Thirdly, a larger thickness of the positive skin leads to a higher tracer concentration around the well, and the opposite is true if the skin is negative. Besides, the model of Leap and Kaplan (1988) underestimates the regional groundwater velocity for the second type of BTCs, and a larger longitudinal dispersivity can lead to a greater error, where the second type of BTCs has a rising limb at early stage followed by a falling limb at late stage. The general conclusion is that the estimations of groundwater velocity from SWPP tests are also affected by skin effects.

AB This study employed SWMM for simulations to elucidate physical mechanisms of LID components in site, as well as coupled Genetic Algorithm with hydrological simulation to determine the optimal spatial configuration of LIDs in a watershed. Using main campus of NTU as a case study, the results shows that the effectiveness of LID depends on storage capacity in delaying and attenuating discharge prior to the onset of peak inflow. With enough surcharge storage control the discharge at the beginning of the rising limb, the benefits of the LID s increased with the rainfall recurrence intervals. A reversal of effect of peak reduction is observed when the surface storage space has been exhausted. At the watershed scale, the optimization results revealed that a higher ratio of LID installations in midstream subcatchments than in upstream and in downstream subcatchments. Hydrograph analysis also explained that installing LID facilities in subcatchments that make their primary contribution to outflow roughly simultaneously with the onset of peak flow is preferable in reducing peak flow at a watershed outlet. The finding of this study could be useful to formulate watershed guidelines or strategies for the installation of decentralized flood reduction facilities.

AB The local approximation prediction model (LPM) is a forecasting approach based on chaos theory. It uses the Euclidean distance to evaluate the spatial proximity between two phase points, which is a measure of "quantity" similarity. This study improved LPM by proposing a coupled "quantity-pattern" similarity model (CQPSM). The "pattern" similarity is defined as the similarity of two phase points on internal structure, and measured by a cumulative unit-step function. The forbearing stratified sequencing method is employed to solve the double objective optimization problem. The proposed model was tested using the data from the Danjiangkou reservoir basin for future 12-monthly precipitation forecasting with lead times from a month to a year. Four performance measures (R, RMSE, MARE and NSE) were computed and compared to those of LPM and autoregressive (AR) model. The results show a better performance of CQPSM and indicates the importance of considering "pattern" similarity between two phase points. Moreover, the weighted Euclidean distance based on partial information logic was discussed and applied to further improve the "quantity" similarity. Consequently, the proposed CQPSM could provide a new alternative for hydrological forecasting.

AB High arsenic concentrations (average 0.1 mg/L) of groundwater were found in Lanyang plain of Taiwan. In this study, 39 groundwater samples from 23 wells were collected and 14 hydro-geochemical parameters were analyzed. Factor analysis was applied to determine major influence factors of the arsenic enriched groundwater quality, and PHREEQC was used to calculate the distribution of aqueous species and saturation index of which affected the hydrogeochemistry of groundwater. 393 geological core samples from 9 drilling wells were collected and analyzed the contents of total arsenic and iron. Moreover, core samples associated with high arsenic concentration groundwater were selected, mineralogical phases were analyzed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), high resolution X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS). Results of the arsenic enrichment factor determined by factor analysis indicated that infiltration of the organic and nitrogen pollutants from anthropogenic activities to shallow groundwater, and the reductive dissolution from iron oxyhydroxides in the deep aquifer were the main processes of arsenic release to groundwater from the sediment. Total arsenic and iron contents of the core samples were well correlated in marine sequences. The presence of clay layer within the subsurface may increase in the As contamination in groundwater aquifer. However the time for As release from clay layer to lower aquifer may require tens or hundreds years to complete under natural environment condition. Surface analyses of core sample performed by XPS showed that arsenic was adsorbed or co-precipitated with non-crystalline iron oxyhdroxides and sulfides. After a long term burial of sediment, microbial metabolism of organic matter creates a more reducing environment, arsenic may then be gradually released from iron oxyhydroxides by reductive dissolution or desorption to aqueous phase. The framboidal-diagenetic type phase was identified by XPS and the groundwater is supersaturated with respect to pyrite and orpiment determined by PHREEQC are suggesting sulfide minerals co precipitate As. Arsenic in sediments is released into groundwater primarily by the reductive dissolution of As-bearing Fe-oxyhydroxides in reducing environment in the Lanyang plain.

AB Agricultural conservation practices, or agricultural best management practices (BMPs), can reduce nutrient loading and help address harmful algal blooms (HABs). HABs in the western basin of Lake Erie, which are largely caused by phosphorus losses from the Maumee River watershed, are critical in the recent years. In this study, a new BMP cost tool was developed. Then the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the new BMP cost tool were integrated to explore efficiencies and cost-effectiveness of BMPs in an agricultural catchment of the Maumee River watershed with various scenarios. The scenarios included individual BMPs applied in 100% of suitable areas, individual BMPs targeting Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus (DRP) and Total Phosphorus (TP) critical areas, and BMPs implemented in series. In addition, a cost-effective approach for the selections and placements of BMPs in agricultural watersheds was developed as an alternative to running complex optimization tools that are not applicable to large watersheds. The cost-effective approach applied BMPs based on cost-effectiveness rankings starting from the most cost-effective one. Results showed that: (1) BMPs implemented in series, which reduced pollutant loads more than individual BMPs, were not as cost-effective as some individual BMPs; (2) among all scenarios, filter strips targeting DRP/TP critical areas were the most cost-effective in reducing yearly/spring DRP/TP losses; (3) to obtain the watershed management plan goal of reducing March-July DRP/TP losses by 40%, implementing BMPs one by one in critical areas based on the cost-effectiveness rankings of individual BMPs in DRP/TP critical areas was the most cost-effective; and (4) the simulation results, modeling tools, and cost-effective approach can help create agricultural BMP strategies to cost-efficiently improve water quality.

AB Interception loss can remove a significant portion of rainwater from forested ecosystems. Therefore, the quantification and modelling of interception loss are of significant importance if human and ecosystem water demands are to be balanced under a future changing climate. This is particularly true for semi-arid/arid regions, where afforestation has become an important ecological restoration measure to tackle desertification, poverty and climate change. However, quantification and modelling of interception loss of plantations in these regions have rarely been reported. In the present study, rainfall interception loss was quantified and modelled over a one-year period (January-December 2016) for a deciduous broad-leafed R. pseudoacacia plantation and an evergreen needle-leaf P. tabuliformis plantation (common afforestation tree species) situated in the semi-arid Loess Plateau of China. The stand age, density, canopy cover and leaf area index of R. pseudoacacia during the study period were 15 years, 2000 tree ha(-1), 0.48 and 1.41 m(2) m(-2), respectively. The corresponding values for Pinus tabuliformis were 17 years, 1200 tree ha(-1), 0.62 and 2.53 m(2) m(-2). The measured throughfall, stemflow and derived estimates of interception loss for R pseudoacacia were 81.1%, 1.3% and 17.6%, respectively. The corresponding values for P. tabuliformis were 75.4%, 0.7% and 23.9%. Given that the weather conditions experienced by the two forest stands were similar, the observed higher interception loss for P. tabuliformis can be explained by the higher canopy storage capacity and wet canopy evaporation rate of this species. The revised Gash analytical model of rainfall interception was well calibrated and validated against field measurements and was able to simulate the cumulative interception loss at two forest stands accurately, and it also effectively captured the seasonal variation (leafed growing and leafless dormant seasons), provided that the optimized wet canopy evaporation rates were used. The revised model was highly sensitive to the canopy storage capacity and changes in the ratio of mean wet canopy evaporation to mean rainfall intensity and less sensitive to canopy cover, but it was found to be fairly insensitive to the trunk storage capacity.

AB This work is concerned with the intricate interplay between node or pore pressures and connection or throat conductivities in flow or pore networks. A setting similar to pore networks is given by fracture networks. Recently, a non-local generalization of Darcy's law for flow and transport in porous media was presented in the context of unbounded or periodic pore networks. In this work, we first outline a robust method for the extraction of the hydraulic conductivity distribution, which is at the heart of the non-local Darcy formulation. Second, a theory for mean pressure and flow in bounded networks is outlined. Predictions of that theory are validated against numerical network results and it is demonstrated that the theory works well for networks with high connectivity involving pores with high coordination numbers. For other networks, improvements to the outlined theory are proposed and their accuracy is assessed.

AB Vegetation can effectively prevent soil loss and play an important role in soil and water conservation. Accurate estimation of hydraulic parameters is critical for soil erosion models. Hydraulic data for different levels of vegetation stem cover, slope gradient and flow discharge are quite limited. The objectives of this study were to compare different measured methods of flow velocity, evaluate the influence of vegetation stem cover, slope gradient and discharge on hydraulic parameters and predict the shear stress (tau), stream power (Omega) and unit stream power (omega) and emphasize the significance of hydraulic radius in the calculation of the shear stress (tau), stream power (Omega), and unit stream power (omega). A non-erodible flume bed was used in this study. The discharge ranged from 0.5 x 10(-3) to 2.0 x 10(-3) m(3) s(-1), the slope gradient ranged from 8.8% to 25.9%, and an artificial stem cover of approximately 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30% was used to represent the natural vegetation. The stems were 2 mm in diameter and randomly arranged. The electrolyte pulse method was preferred for measurement of the overland flow velocity. The flow velocity decreased as the stem cover increased, and flow discharge and slope gradient decreased. The reduction in flow velocity was as high as 90% for 30% stem cover based on the experiments. The flow depth increased as the stem cover and flow discharge increased as the slope gradient decreased. The Reynolds and Froude number values decreased with increasing stem cover. The shear stress, stream power and unit stream power were all significantly affected by the stem cover and could all broadly be described using an exponential delay function of the stem cover. The omega was no significantly impacted by hydraulic radius. Thus, the unit stream power is an improved hydraulic parameter for predicting sediment transport capacity.

AB Existence of preferential flow paths (PFP) in heterogeneous aquifers may dramatically change the behavior of aquifers, making it critical to recognize PFP in solute transport simulation and environmental risk analysis. Conventional particle tracking method can recognize PFP but is computationally demanding and hardly applicable in real high-dimensional problems. Minimum resistance method based on graph theory, though efficient, is unable to consider flow conditions and may lead to implausible path results. In this paper we propose an easy-to-implement method based on stream function to analyze and recognize PFP in heterogeneity of multiple levels. Illustrative examples and robustness tests are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the stream function-based method compared with particle tracking and minimum resistance methods. It is found that the proposed method is able to avoid high computational demand and potential conflicts with hydrodynamic conditions thus is both efficient and reliable.

AB In this study, different Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques including Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN), Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Support Vector Regression (SVR), empirical models including Hargreaves and Samani (HS), Modified Hargreaves and Samani (MHS), Makkink (MK), Ritchie (RT) and conventional Multilinear Regression (MLR), were employed to model Reference Evapotranspiration (ET0) in fourteen stations from several climatic regions in Turkey, Cyprus, Iraq, Iran and Libya. For this purpose, 12 parameters of monthly climate data were collected and used as input parameters to the models. The parameters were subjected to quality assurance tests to ensure their validity and acceptability. The study was conducted in three sections: (i) Sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the dominant inputs. (ii) Single models were trained and their performances were accessed on the basis of ET0 derived from pan evaporation method. (iii) Finally, three ensemble methods of simple averaging, weighted averaging and neural ensemble were applied in strategy 1 (for AI models) and strategy 2 (for empirical models) to improve the predicting performance. The results revealed that depending on the climate of the regions, pan evaporation, solar radiation, temperatures and surface pressure are the most dominant parameters, empirical and MLR models could be employed to achieve the valuable results, AI based models are superior in performance to the other models, also promising improvement in ET0 modeling could be achieved by ensemble modeling. The results of this study affirmed that the provided ensemble approaches can increase the performance of single models in the verification phase up to 22%, for strategy 1 and 55%, for strategy 2. Also, the results demonstrated that AI based ensemble modeling is preferable to empirical ensemble modeling.

AB The author read with much interest the publication by Mize et al (2018) on the decrease in suspended-sediment concentrations and loads in the lower Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers between 1980 and 2015. Researchers interested in sediment dynamics in the lower Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers also should be aware that sediment data previously reported for the lower Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) were affected by a systematic error in the fines fraction (particle sizes less than 0.063 millimeter) of the suspended-sediment concentration. This error affected results reported from October 1973 through February 2015 for two sites on the main stem of the Mississippi River, three sites on the Atchafalaya River, one site on the Old River Outflow Channel, and one site on the Red River. The USGS and USACE identified the error and have revised the results for samples collected from October 1989 through February 2015, as reported by Norton et al. (2019a) and Norton et al. (2019b). The significant conclusions of Mize et al. (2018) and sediment loads modeled using the Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) method were unaffected by the systematic error because the models used data from unaffected sites; however, the background information provided in tables 1 and 2 of Mize et al. (2018) included references to several previous studies that contained results affected by the error. This comment paper identifies which references in Mize et al. (2018) were affected by the error and alerts readers to implications of the data revision.

AB Hydrological processes became non-stationary under the influences of climate change and human activities. This non-stationarity highlights the need to adopt time-varying parameters in hydrological models. The majority of existing literature quantifies time-varying parameters by incorporating real observations of single basin into a hydrological model. They are limited in their information on catchment characteristics and climatic factors to constrain time-varying parameters. Thus, models are difficult to apply for hydrological predictions outside the calibration periods. This paper formulated the time-varying parameters for a lumped hydrological model as explicit functions of physically-based covariates that captured the catchment characteristics. Then, it used a hierarchical Bayesian framework to incorporate the similarity of adjacent basins to reduce the uncertainty of the assumed functions for time-varying parameters. Four modeling scenarios were developed to explore the spatial coherence between different characteristics of adjacent basins. Five criteria were adopted to evaluate the performance of assumed functional forms. Four spatially adjacent catchments in the central United States were selected as case studies to examine the validity of the proposed method. Results showed that (1) the proposed method succeeded in reducing the uncertainty of time-varying parameters, and (2) the seasonality of the catchment storage was more coherent between adjacent basins, indicated by the largest increase in model prediction performance (i.e., 9%). This study improved the understanding of the spatial coherence of time varying parameters, which helps improve hydrological predictions in the future.

AB Wetlands as oxbows play a fundamental socio-economic and environmental role. They behave as efficient tools in regards to hydrological and ecological concerns: they contribute to control rivers discharge (flood prevention and contribution to drought flow) as well as to manage water quality (excess nutrients retention) and they constitute refuge habitats for flora and fauna. They may so become more and more determinant as nature-based solutions in a near future. However, the establishment of complete and reliable functioning models is complicated by the different connection degrees that can present these specific wetlands to the main stream and to the adjunct alluvial aquifer. Moreover, monodisciplinary approaches usually conducted can underestimate or even neglect sources of water supply. The present study offers a multidisciplinary approach coupling hydrodynamic (surface water/groundwater levels), geochemical (T, EC, pH, major ions) and isotopic (delta H-2-delta O-18) characterization in order to properly assess the dynamic of these specific hydrosystems and so be able to establish a complete and reliable hydrodynamic conceptual model. The coupling approach has been tested on the Auzon Oxbow, one of the fluvial annexes of the Allier River (Massif Central, France). The resulting conceptual model testifies for connection degree higher that expected between the oxbow and both the main stream and alluvial aquifer. Indeed, a non-negligible supply of the oxbow by the alluvial groundwater is observed, especially in its downstream part. As this part of the oxbow is the site of its confluence to the Allier River, groundwater supply could have been underestimated. The geochemical approach shows that Allier River also supply the oxbow through the upstream paleochannel, result of a channel migration 30 years ago. Hydrodynamic and isotopic approaches complete the understanding showing that the paleochannel pathway is only active during high flow periods (from November to June). Based on these results, the strategic utility of the proposed approach to study oxbow's hydrosystems has been proved.

AB The potential effect of climate change needs to be considered in urban infrastructure design and risk assessment to improve reliability. The present study proposes a methodology for obtaining grid-scale relative changes for updating 24-h extreme rainfall intensity, through the estimation of rainfall intensity quantiles from baseline and future simulations using a pooled frequency analysis approach. Coherence of relative changes over return periods and time horizons is analysed, and adjustments are proposed to facilitate the application of relative changes in practice. The approach is applied to Canada, using gridded daily precipitation series from model combinations belonging to the North American Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment. Multi model 10th, 50th and 90th percentile relative changes are provided for six return periods, considering two future scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), and two horizons (2050 and 2080). Overall, estimated relative changes varied smoothly and formed a number of clusters of similar values across the country. Relative changes for RCP 8.5 are recommended for 2050, whereas either those for RCP 4.5 or RCP 8.5 could be used for 2080. As an example, median multi-model 50th percentile relative change over Canada is found to be 14%, 16% and 27% for RCP 4.5 - 2080, RCP 8.5 - 2050, and RCP 8.5 - 2080, respectively.

AB In the framework of a natural CO2 reservoir with CO2 leakages as an analogue of a failed CO2 deep geological storage, the current precipitation of travertines and the associated upwelling of CO2-rich saline groundwater were analysed. This natural analogue is located in the Ganuelas-Mazarron Tertiary Basin (SE Spain). The study comprises of the chemistry of both groundwater and travertines, including stable isotopes, mineralogy and petrography of the travertines, all this performed after a review of the geology of the basin. In this sense, the basin gathers the main features of a safe natural CO2 reservoir in a deep saline aquifer sealed by a thick marl formation. The aquifer was artificially perturbed by the drilling of wells, inducing the travertines precipitation at these water discharge points. Groundwater is saline, slightly acid, oversaturated in aragonite and calcite and with significant concentrations of heavy elements, some of them toxic. From an isotopic viewpoint, the relative constant delta C-13-DIC values suggest that carbon is mainly inorganic in origin with minor organic and mantle contributions. Travertines are basically composed of aragonite or calcite, their precipitation being controlled by a sudden CO2 degassing and minor biological activity. Their delta C-13 signatures indicate that carbon mainly has an inorganic origin, although some contribution of organic carbon must be considered as well. Furthermore, these carbonate deposits did not precipitate in isotopic equilibrium, as determined by delta O-18 values. Finally, it is suggested that the appearance of travertines along with their carbon isotopic signatures represent efficient tools for detecting CO2 leakages from any CO2 storage site.

AB Concentrations of uranium (U) > 30 mu g/L in groundwater are relatively uncommon in drinking water in the United States but can be of concern in those areas where complex interactions of aquifer materials and anthropogenic alterations of the natural flow regime mobilize U. High concentrations (> 30 mu g/L) of U in the southeastern San Joaquin Valley, California, USA, have been detected in 24 percent of 257 domestic, irrigation, and public-supply wells sampled across an approximately 110,000 km(2) area. In this study we evaluated mechanisms for mobilization of U in the San Joaquin Valley proposed in previous studies, confirming mobilization by HCO3 and refuting mobilization by NO3 and we refined our understanding of the geologic sources of U to the scale of individual alluvial fans. The location of high concentrations depends on the interactions of geological U sources from fluvial fans that originate in the Sierra Nevada to the east and seepage of irrigation water that contains high concentrations of HCO3 that leaches U from the sediments. In addition, interactions with PO4 from fertilized irrigated fields may sequester U in the aquifer. Principal component analysis of the data demonstrates that HCO3 and ions associated with high total dissolved solids in the aquifer and the percentage of agriculture near the well sampled are associated with high U concentrations. Nitrate concentrations do not appear to control release of U to the aquifer. Age dating of the groundwater and generally increasing U concentrations of the past 25 years in resampled wells where irrigation is prevalent suggests that high U concentrations are associated with younger water, indicating that irrigation of fields over the past 100 years has significantly contributed to increasing concentrations and mobilizing U. In some places, the groundwater is supersaturated with uranyl-containing minerals, as would be expected in roll front deposits. In general, the interaction of natural geological sources high in U, the anthropogenically driven addition of HCO3 and possibly phosphate fertilizer, control the location and concentration of U in each individual fluvial fan, but the addition of nitrate in fertilizer does not appear control the location of high U. These geochemical interactions are complex but can be used to determine controls on anomalously high U in alluvial aquifers.

   AUSTRALIA; RESPONSES; SALINITY
AB Restoration of water quality in deforested watersheds is a major environmental and economic challenge in many parts of the world. In south-western Australia water quality issues manifest as salinisation, where reactivation of groundwater systems has occurred post-deforestation with the consequent discharge of salts stored in deep regolith into rivers. Prior to deforestation the stream salinity of the Denmark River (a forested watershed of 502 km(2)) was between 150 and 350 mg L-1TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) and was developed as a small water supply with potential for a much larger development. By the 1970s, 20% of deep rooted vegetation in the watershed was removed resulting in annual flow-weighted stream salinity of 1500 mg L-1TDS making the river unsuitable as a water supply. Two main policy approaches were used to restore this watershed: (1) the control of further deforestation on private land through regulation; and (2) a program to encourage private reforestation with eucalypt pulp-wood plantations. By 2010, 143% of the watershed was reforested leaving only 5.5% still deforested, with a strong relationship between streamflow and stream salinity and the amount of reforestation. River salinity had fallen to 500 mg L-1 TDS by 2017. Although streamflow had fallen from a mean 28.6 GL yr(-1) in 1985-1990 to 13.6 GL yr(-1) in 2012-2017 this was with water that was potable. The challenge into the future is to ensure the lower stream salinity is maintained through maintenance of forest cover. Importantly, this paper demonstrates that stream salinity can be reversed following deforestation if an appropriate scale of reforestation is deployed.

AB Karst systems can be generally characterised by their high hydrological heterogeneities related mainly to highly variable permeabilities, which can significantly change over small spatial scales. This makes tracing and quantification of water flow pathways an extremely demanding task. In this study we present an analysis of hydrological characteristics of a complex karst system, the Ljubljanica river catchment in central Slovenia. Spatially distributed data on stable isotope composition (delta O-18, delta H-2) of precipitation as inputs, and of several karst springs/sinks as outputs, were obtained. These data were used to identify spatial and seasonal patterns and hydrological behaviour of the karst system in contrasting hydrological conditions. The intensive mixing of continental and Mediterranean air masses over the Ljubljanica river catchment makes the precipitation source identification difficult. However, the results of the precipitation isotopic composition analysis indicate a spatial pattern that could be recognised also in the delta O-18, delta H-2 values of the karst springs and sinks. Along the prevailing karst conduits, the spatial differences in the delta O-18, delta H-2 values decreased. The mean transit time (MTT) estimates using delta O-18, delta H-2 as tracers were similar, with those for the main karst conduits and tributaries ranging between 0.34 and 0.74 years. Such a relatively short MIT could be expected for karst catchments without extensive deep groundwater storage. The fraction of young water (F-yw) for the whole catchment was 0.28, meaning that more than one-quarter of the total discharge was younger than approximately 2.3 months (assuming that the catchment transit time is described by exponential distribution). Small differences in the MTT over different parts of the karst catchment area might indicate intensive mixing and homogenisation of water along the underground conduits. However, the catchment's homogenisation strongly depends on the preceding hydrological conditions; the differences in the isotope composition can be identified during low-flow conditions, which might indicate the dominant influence of the local recharge of the karst springs.

AB Sediment transport in open channels has complicated nature and finding the analytical models applicable for channel design in practice is a quite difficult task. To this end, behind theoretical consideration of the open channel sediment transport through incorporating of four fundamental characteristics of fluid, flow, sediment and channel, recently, machine learning techniques are used for modeling of sediment transport in open channels. However, most of the studies in the literature used limited number of data for model development neglecting some effective parameters involved which may affect their performances. Moreover, most of this studies had not provided a comprehensive explicit equation for future use. Accordingly, this study applied four machine learning techniques of Gene Expression Programming (GEP), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Generalized Structure Group Method of Data Handling (GS-GMDH) and Fuzzy c-means based Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (FCM-ANFIS) to model sediment transport in open channels. Four existing data sets in the literature with wide ranges of pipe size, sediment size, sediment volumetric concentration, channel bed slope and flow depth are used for the model development. The recommended models are compared with their corresponding conventional regression models taken from the literature in terms of different statistical performance indices. Results indicate superiority of the machine leaning techniques to the conventional multiple non-linear regression models. Although, developed GEP, ELM, GS-GMDH and FCM-ANFIS models have almost same performances, GS-GMDH gives slightly better performance which can be linked to the generalized structure of this approach. A MATLAB code is provided to calculate the sediment transport in open channel for practical engineering.

AB Empirical relationships linking kinetic energy to rainfall intensity are commonly used to estimate rainfall erosivity. In this paper, using the drop-size distribution (DSD) proposed by Marshall and Palmer, a relationship for calculating the rainfall kinetic power was firstly deduced. This equation requires the simultaneous measurement of both the median volume diameter and the rainfall intensity and its application also reveals the drawback of needing the measurement of the whole DSD by an expensive disdrometric technique.
   Then, using a fictitious precipitation, which is both constituted by droplets having the same diameter (mean volume diameter) and having the same volume of the actual rainfall, a new expression of the rainfall kinetic power was deduced. This last equation has the advantage of allowing the estimate of the rainfall kinetic power by using the measurements of both rainfall intensity and the total number of droplets, reaching a horizontal unit area in an unit time, which can be acquired by a cheap device using a piezoelectric force transducer.
   This new relationship for estimating the rainfall kinetic power was tested using disdrometric measurements carried out at two experimental sites in Italy (Palermo) and in Spain (El Teularet). These experimental tests demonstrated that the rainfall kinetic power estimated by the mean volume diameter has an accuracy similar to the literature relationships proposed by Wischmeier and Smith, Brown and Foster and McGregor et al.
   Finally this investigation also showed that this novel approach can be applied estimating the median volume diameter by the mean volume diameter and the standard deviation of the measured drop diameters, whose measurement can be obtained by a force transducer.

AB Three approaches were compared for estimating continuous soil water characteristic curves (SWCCs) from easily accessible soil properties. The approaches included combining the Mohammadi and Vanclooster (2011) method (the MV method) with the van Genuchten (1980) model (MV-vG approach), the modified MV-vG approach, and combining the Jensen et al. (2015) method with the Fredlund and Xing (1994) model (the J-FX approach). A total of 195 disturbed soil samples and 195 undisturbed soil cores were collected from 1-m soil profiles in an arid region of northwestern China. Particle size distribution (PSD) and organic matter (OM) content were determined. The volumetric water content and matric potential data pairs of each sample during the drying process were measured using a high speed centrifuge. All of the measured soil properties were used to evaluate the applicability of the approaches for continuous SWCC estimation. The MV method has a robust physical basis and is independent of any experimental SWCC data pairs. Some intrinsic shortcomings affect the estimation of continuous SWCC by the MV-vG approach. The integration of a soil structure feature improved the estimation of the modified MV-vG approach. The estimation of the J-FX approach for SWCC is robust for the five textural classes, and outperformed the MV-vG approach and the modified MV-vG approach. The good performance of the J-FX approach can be attributed in part to the fact that it distinguishes the dominant forces governing water retention of dry and wet ranges, and relates the PSD, specific surface area, and OM content to the pore size distribution. All these factors are vital for soil water retention, but have been simplified or ignored by the MV method. Both the modified MV-vG approach and the J-FX approach are promising for estimating continuous SWCCs at a regional scale. The modified MV-vG approach may be suitable for rigid soils with medium textures at potentials above wilting point. The J-FX approach is applicable for the whole range of water retention from saturation to oven dryness for soils with substantially varying bulk density, soil texture and organic matter content at a regional scale. The results of this study are fundamental for use in simulating the transfer of water and solutes in layered-structured soil profiles and for estimating the vegetation carrying capacity of soil available water in arid regions.

AB A smart decision making framework for stormwater management systems is designed through predictive real-time control (RTC) of the outlet gate of a stormwater basin. The proposed framework offers a cost-effective non-structural solution for dynamically controlling stormwater basins through manipulating the outlet gate and providing optimized outflow set-points. An integrated RTC optimization and rule-based approach is designed to mitigate the impact of the discharged runoff on the receiving watercourse, both in terms of quantity and quality. In this approach, the optimization part provides the optimized outflow set-points for the basin to minimize peak flows during the wet periods, while the rule-based part controls the quality of the discharged water, through sedimentation, by increasing the detention time. Various rainfall data series are used as inputs for a case study stormwater basin to verify the performance of the proposed methodology. The efficiency of the stormwater basin in reducing peak flows and improving the quality of outflow was estimated by comparing, respectively, the peak flows and detention times of the integrated RTC strategy with those of a static approach. The results showed an improved quantity and quality control performance for the studied stormwater basin, in comparison to the static control approach, both in current climate conditions with a peak flow reduction from 73 to 95% and detention times varying from 16 to 30 h, and in future climate conditions with an averagely reduction of 76% in peak flows and an average detention time of 19 h.

AB Water resources management often involves models that simulate physical/chemical processes to make predictions of future system behavior. These predictions often contain uncertainty that must be considered in order to make robust decisions. The quantification of this uncertainty is often not conducted in practice due to computational limitations and a lack of flexible software capabilities. To bridge this gap, we have developed a heuristic, multi-objective, model-independent optimization methodology using TCP/IP network communications for parallel run management on high-performance computing systems. The proposed optimization methodology is based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), where the memory-like nature of PSO makes it ideal for tracing a Pareto front that graphically illustrates the trade-off between competing objective functions. Although the focus of this study is on addressing the likelihood of an undesirable or contested model prediction, the proposed methodology can be extended to any multi-objective optimization context, and is also able to handle inequality constraints that reflect additional conditions that must be met along the front. We have demonstrated the algorithm on two important real-world case studies. The first case study involved water allocation issues in Antelope Valley, California, USA, where the uncertainty in total natural recharge into the valley has raised significant debates over water management. The second case study involved the re-injection of coal seam gas co-produced water into deep aquifers in the Surat Basin, Queensland, Australia, where the potential impact of an undesired mobilization of arsenic concentrations needed to be understood and managed. This case study required a highly nonlinear field-scale reactive transport model, and an inequality constraint was also necessary to maintain consistency with a laboratory-scale geochemical model. The efficiency at which the proposed methodology solved these complex case studies demonstrates its effectiveness for a broad range of applications.

AB Stormwater flow rate attenuation is an important component of stormwater management but the mechanisms governing peak flowrate attenuation have received limited attention in the green roof community. Previous green roof literature studies that have reported peak flow rate attenuation have focused on comparing the peak precipitation intensity with the peak drainage rate over a given storm event. However peak drainage rates do not necessarily correspond with peak precipitation intensity if peak precipitation intensity occurs before field capacity is achieved. As such use of event based flow rate attenuation does not facilitate investigation of the mechanisms governing peak flow rate attenuation. This study combines field data collected on a 200 m(2) green roof with a Richards based numerical model to quantify and provide new insights into the mechanisms governing flow rate attenuation. The average peak flow rate attenuation from all measured drainage events was 58% (n = 121 distinct rainfall peaks) and the average peak delay was 12.8 min. Field capacity was found to be a statistically significant point where attenuation performance decreases. Peak stormwater flow rate attenuation below field capacity was found to be significantly higher than after field capacity is reached with capillary storage the dominant attenuation mechanism before field capacity is reached and routing and gravity storage important attenuation mechanisms after field capacity is reached. The Richards equation based numerical model yielded very good predictions of observed peak flow rates using laboratory derived model parameters and without the need for model calibration. This study suggests that green roofs have considerable potential to attenuate stormwater flow rate, thus helping to mitigate damage due to urban runoff and providing some protection against storm intensification associated with climate change. The validated numerical model is a valuable tool for the prediction of stormwater flow rate attenuation in different climates and can therefore be used in green roof design and by regulators to better evaluate the potential benefits of green roofs.

AB Evaluation of the engrossment of watershed surface characteristics on partitioning of precipitation to runoff and evapotranspiration is key to inspect the availability of water at watershed scale. It is more evident in the cases of ungauged watersheds. The present study develops models using multiple linear regression method and machine learning techniques (ANN: Artificial Neural Network and RVM: Relevance Vector Machine) over 793 (25 major river basins and 768 watersheds across India) to estimate the watershed parameter 'omega' (in Fu's Budyko based equation) that represents intrinsic watershed attributes. In addition, seasonality factor is incorporated in the model due to intra-annual variability in vegetation across India. The models attempt to explain the intricate relationship between vegetation alterations and regional water balance. It is seen that the ANN and RVM models have performed better in estimating omega, than the MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) models. In addition, NDVI has shown more engagement in explaining the partitioning process of water in intra-annual low NDVI period compared to high NDVI period. We have also found the present models to be more accurate than the previously developed Budyko based methods in predicting omega. The newly improved models have closely imitated the intrinsic basin attributes and enhanced the functionality of Budyko framework in estimation of water availability, which would play a crucial role in assessment of hydrology of ungauged watersheds of India.

AB The robust optimization of groundwater quality monitoring network is subject to many conflicting objectives and high level of uncertainty in hydraulic conductivity. This study develops a two-stage stochastic optimization framework including the uncertainty quantification using a cheap-to-evaluate surrogate model and an improved epsilon multi-objective noisy memetic algorithm (epsilon-MONMA) for monitoring network design. The surrogate model based on sparse polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is constructed to replace expensive simulation model in the uncertainty quantification of concentrations at the pre-defined monitoring locations for reducing huge computational cost. Additionally, the scenario discovery strategy using sparse PCE model is applied to filter a typical scenario set and the centroid of contaminant plume is used as the diversity metric, which avoids enumerating all possible contamination plumes caused by the uncertain K-field in the optimization. The proposed algorithm is then employed to solve stochastic management model to achieve robust monitoring design, indicating the insensitivity of monitoring design to plume uncertainty no matter which of the many possible scenarios becomes the true distribution of contamination under the true K-field. A synthetic aquifer considering uncertainty in hydraulic conductivity is designed to optimize monitoring network design. The Pareto-optimal solutions to the synthetic example are achieved under three of plume scenario sets defined at deterministic scenario (Scenario A0), Monte Carlo based scenario discovery (Scenario A1) and surrogate assisted scenario discovery (Scenario A2), respectively. Comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the monitoring design based on Scenario A2 outperforms either of the two designs based on Scenarios A0 and A1 in terms of the improvement of robustness of designs evaluated against the typical scenario set. Meanwhile, the performance of monitoring network deteriorates as the uncertainty of plume (noisy strength) increases, indicating the significance of reducing parameter uncertainty in groundwater monitoring design. The research findings show that the developed stochastic optimization framework is a computationally efficient and promising tool for multi-objective design of groundwater monitoring network under uncertainty.

AB Thermal waters in the Central Highlands of Madagascar around Antsirabe were investigated using a combination of hydrogeochemical and isotopic methods, geochemical speciation and inverse geochemical modeling. Thermal waters at Antsirabe have temperatures from 35.2 to 47.7 degrees C, are highly mineralized (EC up to 5.87 mS/cm) are of Na-HCO3-Cl type and have elevated concentrations of arsenic (up to 0.597 mg/l), Sr (up to 8.05 mg/l) and Li (up to 2.83 mg/l). About 25 km west of Antsirabe, a thermal spring at Betafo has a temperature of 53.6 degrees C, but its mineralization is much lower (EC 0.72 mS/cm) and its water is of Na-HCO3-SO4 type. Concentrations of As, Sr, and Li at Betafo are much lower, only 0.006 mg/1, 0.72 mg/l, and 0.063 mg/l, respectively. Calculated reservoir temperatures using quartz and chalcedony geothermometers are up to 153 degrees C at Antsirabe and 108 degrees C at Betafo. Values of delta H-2 and delta O-18 are above the WMWL, indicating exchange with silicates like micas. Values of delta C-13(DIC) are very enriched (up to 0.45%x) in Antsirabe samples, but depleted with a value of 21.52%0 in a Betafo sample. Values of delta S-34(SO4) are close to -4.0 parts per thousand in all samples, suggesting an origin of sulfate from a Na-sulfate mineral. Values of Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios in Antsirabe samples suggest interactions with reservoir rocks. The principal difference between both sites seems to be in the significant input of magmatic-origin CO2 at the Antsirabe site (up to 61.4 mmol/l as determined by inverse geochemical modeling) with resulting higher dissolution rates of As-containing silicate minerals such as micas. There is probably no such input at the Betafo site. In spite of relatively lower As concentrations compared to geothermal waters at global tectonic plate margins, concentrations of As at Antsirabe can represent a serious environmental problem.

AB Interaction between meteorological and hydrologic processes is challenging to model owing to their high spatio-temporal variability. The understanding of their associations can help to ensure future fresh water security with changing climate. In this study, due to continuously evolving nature of these interactions, the hydrological and meteorological variables are studied on wavelet component level. Multi-Resolution Stationary Wavelet Transformation (MRSWT) is used to transform the independent (climatic variable) and dependent (hydrological variable) time series into their components. The components of the dependent time series are modeled using a kernel-based auto-regressive (AR) model for separating their memory part. The residuals are hypothesized to be the effect of interaction of predictor variables and thus, are modeled using the MRSWT components of meteorological variables in an auto-regressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX). Finally, the predicted residuals (effect of climatic variables) are added to the component estimated by kernel-based AR estimator (memory of dependent series components) to obtain the predicted components of the dependent hydrologic variable, which are then inverse-transformed to obtain the predicted dependent hydrologic variable. The developed hybrid Wavelet-ARX is found to capture the information about relationship between synthetically generated data better than a simple ARX model. The model is then applied to predict total monthly rainfall over Upper Mahanadi Basin and is found to effectively extract the information from the poorly associated hydro meteorological variables. While the potential of Wavelet-ARX is found to be impressive for hydro meteorological applications, additionally, discarding some climatic inputs on the basis of their relative importance may lead to better prediction by the developed model. The developed model is suitable for extracting climatic forcings and is desirable in a changing climate.

AB This study proposes a new method for downscaling actual evapotranspiration from resolution of 1-km to 30-m. The disaggregation approach is performed using the Jarvis model to simulate surface resistance, which describes the restriction of vapor from land surface, in the water exchange process without using land surface temperature data. The integrated surface resistance model, which takes climate indicators and canopy conditions into account, is primarily validated using in situ observations and employed in the downscaling model with considerable accuracy covering an entire growing season (April-October) in Zhangye Oasis. Good performance and good agreements between daily downscaled results and flux records from an EC (Eddy Covariance) tower have been obtained. The coefficient of determination (R-2) ranges from 0.80 to 0.91, and the mean bias (MB) ranges from 0.17 to 0.72. The vegetation growth process is also captured well by the downscaled results. The proposed method in this research performs better than downscaling approach based on land surface temperature. The accurate validation results and detailed spatial patterns suggest that the proposed downscaling strategy is reliable for water resource management.

AB Dams and reservoirs provide decision-makers and managers with appropriate control on the available water resources, allowing the implementation of various strategies for the most efficient usage of the available water resources. In areas where water supply exhibits significant temporal variation when compared with the demand, the challenge is to bridge the gap and achieve an optimal match between the water supply and demand patterns. Therefore, the release of water from reservoirs should be controlled to ensure that the operation rule for the available water storage in the reservoir is optimized to satisfy the future water demands. This level of optimal control can only be achieved using an efficient optimization algorithm to optimally derive the operation rule for such a complex water system. Herein, two main methods have been considered to tackle this water resource management problem. First, three different optimization algorithms, namely particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, and whale optimization algorithm, have been applied. In addition, two different optimization algorithms, namely crow search algorithm and master-slave algorithm, have been introduced to generate an optimal rule for water release policy. Further, the proposed optimization algorithms have been applied to one of the most critical dam and reservoir water systems, namely the Aswan High Dam (AHD), which controls almost 95% of Egypt's water resources. The current operation of AHD using the existing optimization rules resulted in a mismatch between the water supply and water demand. In other words, the water availability could be higher than the water demand during a certain period, whereas it could be less than the water demand during another period. The results denoted that the master-slave algorithm outperforms the remaining algorithms and generates an optimization rule that minimizes the mismatch between the water supply and water demand.

AB Post-processing of hydrological model simulations using machine learning algorithms can be applied to quantify the uncertainty of hydrological predictions. Combining multiple diverse machine learning algorithms (referred to as base-learners) using stacked generalization (stacking, i.e. a type of ensemble learning) is considered to improve predictions relative to the base-learners. Here we propose stacking of quantile regression and quantile regression forests. Stacking is performed by minimising the interval score of the quantile predictions provided by the ensemble learner, which is a linear combination of quantile regression and quantile regression forests. The proposed ensemble learner post-processes simulations of the GR4J hydrological model for 511 basins in the contiguous US. We illustrate its significantly improved performance relative to the base-learners used and a less prominent improvement relative to the "hard to beat in practice" equal-weight combiner.

ID HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES; RUNOFF; COMPACTION
AB This study focused on the sensitivity of flood dynamics to soil hydraulic properties derived from three different soil databases in urbanized area: (1) upscaled locally observed soil texture data based on the soil-landscape relationships (SMLS); (2) the SoilGrids250m open data source (SMSG); and (3) the FAO soil map (SMFAO). However, soil in the urban areas has two major conditions related to land cover and soil physical structure for which the information is not available in soil databases: the effect of fragmented vegetation cover and the effect of compaction of bare soil. Non-built-up areas can be covered by fragmented vegetation (grass and shrubs) which generally has high infiltration rates. In contrast, bare areas such as dirt roads and footpath can be heavily compacted and have typically low infiltration rates. We used Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) with satellite-derived vegetation cover and bare soil to predict soil hydraulic properties related to the uncompacted and compacted scenarios. Infiltration dynamics was derived from the predicted soil hydraulic properties for these soil information sources, which then determined the flood dynamics in the catchment. The flash flood modeling was done using the integrated flood modeling system using openLISEM (Bout and Jetten, 2018) for the whole of Kampala (Uganda) using the 25th of June 2012 flood event. In the distributed openLISEM hydrological model, these two urban soil conditions have been treated separately. We have evaluated the sensitivity of flood dynamics to three different soil databases under both uncompacted and compacted urban soil conditions by using different flood indicators such as catchment water balance, infiltration rate, flood depth and duration, flooded area and flood volume, and the average number of structures affected. The result of the study indicates that soil hydraulic properties needed for the distributed hydrological model are better predicted when using the SMSG and SMLS, which resulted in better infiltration simulation. Consequently, compared to an earlier simulation that was verified with stakeholders and accepted for drainage system design, the accuracy of the simulated flood extent map was better when using SMSG and SMLS. Moreover, soil compaction significantly reduces infiltration and consequently increases the flood depth and duration, and therefore, must be included in the urban flash flood modeling study.

AB To manage a river sudden pollution incident, a fundamental task is to quickly identify when, where, and how much pollutant was released. The source identification of this kind of pollution incident due to instantaneously spilled pollutant from point source remains a challenging problem because of the limited observations and the ill-posedness. In this paper, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is coupled with the backward location probability (BLP) to improve its performance in identifying the river pollution source. When applied in practice, the proposed BLP-EnKF method has two important advantages. First, it supports on-line identification and can mitigate the limitation from shortage of observations in the sudden river pollution case. Second, BLP-EnKF performs much better than conventional EnKF in terms of computation time, because it can identify the pollution source without restart forecast process. The effectiveness and efficiency of BLP-EnKF is tested and demonstrated by a synthetic case study. The case results show that the BLP-EnKF can identify all the source parameters with a relative error approximately 1.00% or smaller. Its performance can be further improved with more accurate estimation of observational error or dispersion coefficient. A real-world case in Ganjiang River further demonstrates the applicability of BLP-EnKF in practice. The pollution source is identified successfully with relative errors smaller than 3.0% for all the source parameters, while the computation time is sharply shorted from 8.0 h of conventional EnKF to 22.0 s of BLP-EnKF.

AB Environmental tracer data, such as the stable water isotopic composition of streamwater and precipitation, are valuable for understanding runoff generation processes and calibrating hydrological models. Despite recent technical advancements, the collection and analysis of streamwater and precipitation samples still involve significant costs and efforts. Consequently, it is useful to study how many samples need to be collected as a basis for model calibration and what the most informative sampling times are. In previous studies, we used the Birkenes hydrological model and synthetic data to explore the value of a few stream isotope samples for event-based model calibration. Our results showed that the information from two or three selected isotope samples, and particularly a sample taken during the falling limb of the hydrograph, improved model performance significantly compared to calibration against streamflow data only. In this follow-up study, we used a unique Swiss dataset with high-frequency isotope measurements of precipitation and streamwater during six rainfall-runoff events to determine which stream isotope samples were most informative for model calibration. Several benchmarks were used to judge model validation performance. Our results showed that for 83% of the 42 possible combinations of calibration and validation events two strategically selected streamwater samples improved model performance compared to the lower benchmark when only stream stage data were used for calibration. The most informative samples also improved the calibration of a mixing-related parameter. When the model was calibrated and validated for the same event, the most informative samples for model calibration were those from the early part of the falling limb, which confirmed the results of the previous studies with synthetic data. Pre-event isotope samples were more informative when the model was calibrated for one event and then validated against other events or all events combined. Our results suggest that relatively inexpensive event-based data for model calibration can be obtained for so-far ungauged catchments by placing a water level logger in the stream and collecting precipitation isotope data and a few streamflow samples. These samples should preferably include a pre-event sample and a sample from the early falling limb. However, similar analyses for a wider range of sites and events, in combination with a selection of models with different structures and assumptions, are needed to confirm these results and to optimise sampling strategies further.

In general, existing literature focus on the impact of water-saving irrigation techniques on crop yield and water consumption during the growth period at sites or experimental units, few studies yet that explicitly addresses the effect of developments in water-saving irrigation techniques on large-scale WF accounting and benchmarking. Here, we fill this gap through a case study for wheat in China over 2000-2014, during which the micro-irrigated wheat area expanded 14 times. The green and blue WFs of China's wheat per year are estimated at a 5 arc-minute resolution. For irrigated wheat, we distinguish three irrigation techniques: furrow, sprinkler and micro-irrigation. The WF benchmarks by irrigation type are further estimated separately for arid and humid zones. Irrigation accounted for 70% of annual WF in China's wheat land, while furrow irrigation dominated the national total WF. The occupation by WF under micro-irrigation was the smallest but jumped by 14 times in quantity whereas that under sprinkler halved. China's average WF per ton of wheat under sprinkler irrigation was 21% higher than that under micro-irrigation in 2014. The 20th percentile WF benchmarks of wheat under micro-irrigation was 13% and 31% smaller than that under furrow and sprinkler irrigation, respectively, in arid zones. Meanwhile, high provincial heterogeneities in terms of WF under varied distribution of irrigation techniques were also shown. The study shows possibility and importance to account for developments of water-saving techniques in large-scale crop WF estimations.

AB Increasing city resilience to floods under climate change has become one of the major challenges for decision makers, urban planners, and engineering practitioners around the world. Accurate prediction of urban floods under heavy precipitation is critically important to address such a challenge as it can help understand the vulnerability of a city to future climate change and simulate the effectiveness of various sustainable engineering techniques in reducing urban flooding risks in real urban settings. Here, we propose a new model for urban flood prediction under heavy precipitation. The model divides an irregular urban area into many grid cells with no limitation on the spatial resolution as long as the DEM data of the same resolution are available. It is capable of reflecting the frequent inflow or outflow interactions among grid cells and capturing the rapid generation of surface runoff in urban areas during heavy rainfall. The model also accounts for typical characteristics of urban areas, such as large-scale impermeable surfaces and urban drainage systems, in order to simulate urban floods more realistically. In addition, the model uses both surface elevation and instantaneous surface water depth of all grid cells to dynamically determine the directions of horizontal inflow and outflow during each time step of model simulation. This enables the model to capture the reverse-flow phenomenon which is commonly seen in flat urban areas during heavy storms. By applying the proposed model for reproducing the 2016 flood in Lafayette Parish, Louisiana, we demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting real-world flood events.

AB Dewatering using a combination of waterproof curtain and pumping wells is commonly adopted to ensure the stability of foundation pits in multi-aquifer strata. However, dewatering is likely to result in environmental problems. This paper investigates the impact on surroundings owing to the interaction between the waterproof curtain and pumping wells by numerical simulation. The depth of the diaphragm wall penetrating the dewatering aquifer (D) and the filter length of pumping wells (L) are varied in the simulation. The relationship between approximate hydraulic gradient (Delta i) or ground settlement outside the foundation pit (S) with curtain depth ratio R-D (D over the thickness of the dewatering confined aquifer H-a) or filter length ratio R-L (L/H-a) can be divided into three change parts, namely initial gradual, middle sharp and final gentle part. Three values of R-D and R-L, namely effective, suggested and control value, are proposed. R-D and R-L should vary between the effective and control value. The suggested value of R-D and R-L, is recommended in actual engineering by comprehensive consideration. The effective, suggested and control value of R-D can be calculated by a linear equation according to the value of R-L.

AB This study explores the utility of observations of deuterium excess (dx) of water vapor for attribution of vapor to remote source regions and local influences. A Lagrangian back trajectory model was combined with various parameterizations of the dx of ocean evaporation and land evapotranspiration to simulate daily vapor dx at a continental site, a marine site and a coastal site. The model reproduced reasonably well the observed variabilities in the vapor dx at the coastal and the marine site when water vapor at these sites were primarily influenced by large-scale advection from ocean sources. The simple parameterization relating dx of the ocean evaporation to relative humidity is a robust representation of the ocean isotopic evaporation. On the other hand, the model did poorly for the continental site and during the land evapotranspiration dominated months at the coastal and the marine site, confirming the published findings that the water vapor dx near the Earth's surface can be significantly altered by land evapotranspiration and therefore is not a conserved tracer of humidity from the marine moisture source region. Several parameterizations for the dx of land evapotranspiration suggested by previous studies were tested with the trajectory model, but none brought improvement to the simulation of the dx at the continental site. Our study emphasizes that a fundamental challenge in isotopy hydrology is the lack of understanding of the different fractionation processes of O-18 and D associated with land evapotranspiration.

AB Although previous studies have estimated the effects of human regulations on hydrological drought, few studies have examined the impacts from the perspective of the development and recovery processes of hydrological drought. This study uses the Dongjiang River Basin in south China as an example and focuses on the influence of reservoir operation on hydrological drought. The Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI) and run theory were applied to determine the development and recovery processes of hydrological drought. A semi-distributed hydrological model, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), was used to simulate long time series (> 30 years) monthly streamflow data; the SWAT model was calibrated and validated using the monthly streamflow data from periods with less human regulations. Streamflow was then simulated and compared by using the same model parameters, as well as the sub-surface features, to simulate the streamflow during the human regulation periods. The "simulated-observed" comparative approach (i.e., a comparison of the characteristics of the hydrological drought obtained from the simulation-based SSI and observation-based SSI) was used to assess the impacts of human regulations on hydrological drought development and recovery. The results showed that the 'simulated-observed' comparison approach based on the SWAT model exhibited a good ability to ascertain the impacts of human regulations on hydrological drought development and recovery. The reservoir operation was the dominant factor affecting the hydrological drought propagation in the lower reaches of the Dongjiang River basin and had mostly a short-term effect by decreasing the duration and severity of drought development (or recovery). However, the reservoirs tended to release water during the development process and to store water during the recovery process during a long-term hydrological drought in the study area, leading to an increase in average recovery duration and severity. The results of this study may further optimize water resources management system during drought for effective drought prevention and mitigation.

AB Reliable and accurate prediction of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is a precondition for the efficient management and planning of agricultural water resources as well as the optimal design of irrigation scheduling. This study evaluated the performances of four bio-inspired algorithm optimized extreme learning machine (ELM) models, i.e. ELM with genetic algorithm (ELM-GA), ELM with ant colony optimization (ELM-ACO), ELM with cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and ELM with flower pollination algorithm (ELM-FPA), for predicting daily ETo across China by using a five-fold cross-validation approach. These models were further compared with the classical ELM model parameterized by the grid search method to demonstrate their capability and efficiency. Daily maximum and minimum ambient temperatures, wind speed, relative humidity and global solar radiation data during 2001-2015 collected from eight meteorological stations in contrasting climates of China were utilized to train, validate and test the models. The results showed that ETo values predicted by all ELM models agreed well with the corresponding FAO-56 Penman-Monteith values, with R-2, RMSE, NRMSE and MAE ranging 0.9766-0.9967, 0.0896-0.2883 mm day(-1), 3.2910%-11.7653% and 0.0708-0.1998 mm day(-1), respectively. The ELM-FPA model (R-2 = 0.9930, RMSE = 0.1589 mm day(-1), NRMSE = 5.5406% and MAE = 0.1188 mm day(-1)) slightly out-performed the ELM-CSA model (R-2 = 0.9922, RMSE = 0.1619 mm day(-1), NRMSE = 5.6864% and MAE = 0.1200 mm day(-1)) during testing, both of which were superior to the ELM-ACO (R-2 = 0.9912, RMSE = 0.1730 mm day(-1), NRMSE = 6.0816% and MAE = 0.1254 mm day(-1)) and ELM-GA (R-2 = 0.9889, RMSE = 0.1895 mm day(-1), NRMSE = 6.7197% and MAE = 0.1310 mm day(-1)) models, followed by the standalone ELM model (R-2 = 0.9856, RMSE = 0.2104 mm day(-1), NRMSE = 7.1693% and MAE = 0.1408 mm day(-1)). The four hybrid ELM models exhibited higher improvements in daily ETo prediction in the temperate monsoon and (sub)tropical monsoon climates (with average decrease in RMSE of 14.0%, 25.1%, 31.4% and 33.1%, respectively), compared with those in the temperate continental and mountain plateau climates (with average decrease in RMSE of 5.2%, 9.8%, 12.9% and 14.1%, respectively). The results advocated the capability of bio-inspired optimization algorithms, especially the FPA and CSA algorithms, for improving the performance of the conventional ELM model in daily ETo prediction in contrasting climates of China.

AB An abrupt change is an important manifestation of hydroclimatic variability. Accurate detection of change points is a critical issue in hydroclimatic and climate change studies. In the article, we evaluated the performances of 12 methods (including both parametric and non-parametric) for detecting change points in hydroclimatic time series by considering the influences of eight major factors. Different methods exhibited different efficiencies and eight of the methods performed better which are recommended for application. Furthermore, the mean values of series and locations of change points were found to have little influence on the detection of change points. However, for a time series with smaller variance but bigger skewness and larger difference in the mean values before and after the change point, the abrupt changes can be more easily and accurately detected. Detection of change points in shorter series would have larger uncertainty. Based on the Monte-Carlo experiments, the efficiency of each method was quantified and its capability was quantitatively clarified. Detection of abrupt changes in precipitation over Southwest China showed that the Indian monsoon had a dominant influence on precipitation in the regions south of 30 degrees N and west of 110 degrees E. Since 2007 the Indian monsoon has maintained a weakening pattern, causing a decrease in precipitation on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, which is one of the main causes of frequently occurring droughts. Results of this study can be a useful reference for choosing a method to detect change points in hydroclimate time series, and be an important complement for the detection and attribution of hydroclimatic variability.

AB In this study, we developed a one-dimensional mobile-mobile model (MM) for contaminant transport in subsurface with depth-dependent reaction coefficients. Two local systems at micro-scale level are involved in this model: a micro-pore system and a less permeable pore system. The breakthrough curves (BTCs) obtained from the MM with depth-dependent coefficients were thoroughly analyzed, where the case with constant coefficients was used as the reference system. The effects of different parameters on BTCs were studied, and a parameter analysis was also performed to illustrate the effects of adsorption coefficient and degradation coefficient on BTCs. Results show that the BTC patterns for the depth-dependent reactions, in which the reaction rate decreases with increasing depth, vary between the two extreme cases with constant-rate reactions in the topsoil and observation depth. The mass transfer coefficient (alpha) plays a significant role in defining the BTC pattern. The double peak changes to a single peak when the value of alpha is large enough. In addition, the velocity of the main flow determines the shape of the BTCs while the velocity of the SVD defines the pattern of the dual peaks in BTCs which also tends to be represented by a single peak as the velocity decreases. Finally, we tested the applicability of the proposed model (MM-FD) in the leaching experiments of both field herbicide and conservative tracer in an agricultural area of northeastern Greece, and compared its performance with that of the advection-dispersion equation (ADE) model by Gao et al. (2013), both of which have depth-dependent coefficients. The results showed that the proposed mobile-mobile model with depth-dependent reaction coefficients was able to satisfactorily capture the evolution of metolachlor concentration both at upper and lower depths.

AB Accurate and reliable short-term runoff prediction is of great significance to the management of water resources optimization and reservoir flood operation. In order to improve the accuracy of short-term runoff forecasting, a hybrid model-based "feature decomposition-learning reconstruction" named VMD-DBN-IPSO was proposed. In this paper, variational mode decomposition (VMD) is first used to decompose the original daily runoff series into a set of sub-sequence for improving the frequency resolution. Partial autocorrelation function (PACF) is then applied to determine the input variables of each sub-sequence. The improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is combined with the deep belief network (DBN) model to predict each sub-sequences and finally reconstruct the ensemble forecasting result. Three quantitative evaluation indicators, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), were used to evaluate and compare the established models using the historical daily runoff data (1/1/1988-31/12/2017) at Yangxian and Ankang hydrological station in the Han River Basin of China. Meanwhile, a comparative analysis of the performance of VMD-DBN-IPSO model under different forecast periods (1-, 3-, 5- and 7-day lead time) was performed. In addition, the prediction ability of peak runoff of the VMD-DBN-IPSO model is further verified by analyzing the 10 peak flows during the testing data-series. The results indicate that the VMD-DBN-IPSO model can always achieve the best performance in the training and testing stage, and has good stability and representativeness, the NSE coefficient remains above 0.8, and the prediction error of peak flow is within 20%. It is a preferred data-driven tool for forecasting daily runoff.

AB The hydrological regimes of downstream reservoirs have been significantly altered due to the operation and regulation of upstream cascade reservoirs. The original design flood quantiles, namely "design flood in construction period", do not consider anthropogenic impacts in reservoir operation period, and have led to enormous conflicts between flood control and conservation. In this study, the "design flood and flood limited water level in operation period" are defined for practical application. We establish a general framework to measure the spatiotemporal pattern of streamflow and to estimate design floods of cascade reservoirs in operation period. The multivariate t-copula and a genetic algorithm strategy are proposed to solve the curse of dimensionality encountered in the derivation of most likely regional composition. The Jinsha River and Yalong River cascade reservoir system in China, which consists of 13 large reservoirs with the total storage capacity of 74.06 billion m(3) and hydropower capacity of 71.47 GW, is selected as a case study. Results indicate that: (1) The curse of dimensionality can be well addressed by applying multivariate t-copula to build high dimensional joint distribution and using the genetic algorithm to achieve the most likely regional composition. (2) Compared with the design floods in construction period, the design floods of downstream reservoirs in operation period have been significantly reduced due to the upstream reservoir regulation. The 1000-year design peak flood discharge, 3-day, 7-day and 30-day flood volumes of Xiangjiaba reservoir decrease by 38.7%, 37.4%, 34.2% and 13.8%, respectively. (3) The flood limited water level of these reservoirs can be raised without increasing flood control risks in operation period. The cascade reservoirs in the Jinsha River and Yalong River can generate 3.28 billion kW h more hydropower (or increase 4.3%) annually during flood season.

AB Knowledge about the origin and transformation of nutrients at different temporal scales in river ecosystems can provide a better understanding of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles in rivers and bear important implications for regional and global C and N cycling. In this study, stable isotopes of C and N (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and a radioactive isotope of Pb-210 were used to investigate the factors affecting seasonal and long-term changes in N source apportionment and C and N biogeochemical processes in the Beijiang River located in the Pearl River basin, China. Source apportionment by a Bayesian model (stable isotopic analysis in R, SIAR) showed significant seasonal variations. During the flood season, the dominant origins were non-point sources, such as soil N for dissolved nitrogen (DN, accounting for 38%), soil organic matter for particulate organic matter (POM, 58%) and sedimentary organic matter (SOM, 31%), due to intense precipitation. During the non-flood season, fertilizer became the dominant nitrate source (48%), and effluent detritus prevailed in the POM (47%) and SOM (32%) pools. N transformation between the DN, POM and SOM was influenced by seasonally variable hydrology. Our data suggested that low discharge was more favorable for the vertical mixing of the water column and sedimentation, which was supported by similar delta N-15 values in the DN, POM and SOM in the non-flood season. A sedimentary history record of 65 years (1951-2015) showed that the variation of N in the sediment was mainly affected by human activities. From 1999 to 2005, a decreasing trend in the delta N-15 values was observed due to the promotion of aquatic plant cultivation after reservoir impoundment. From 2005 to 2011, the enrichment in the delta N-15 values was caused by increases in manure and sewage due to the development of the tourism industry. From 2011 to 2015, the increase in pollution treatment funds from the government improved the water environment, resulting in delta N-15 depletion in the sediment. At the 65-year temporal scale, increased temperature and CO2 concentration had less impact on the C and N cycles in river ecosystems, however, high discharge could increase the C and N contents, and flood events might increase the delta N-15 values in the sediment. This study provided more detailed information regarding the nutrient sources and improved our understanding of the C and N cycling processes at different temporal scales in river ecosystems.

AB Non-contact flow measurement method plays an increasingly important role in river discharge measurement. However, most channel cross-section velocity distribution models proposed by researchers have certain limitations in application, underwater velocities are always necessary when applied in narrow channels, which makes it challenging to calculate natural river discharge using water-surface velocities measured by remote sensing instruments. This letter takes water-surface velocities detected by UHF radar as boundary conditions and a new velocity distribution model is derived based on the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (BANS) equations. UHF radar measures surface velocities of the cross-section, and velocities on the river bed of the cross-section are considered to be 0. The BANS equations are simplified to be a two-dimensional Poisson equation and the cross-section velocity distribution is solved by using the closed boundary conditions. Some field experiments were conducted in the Hanjiang River at Xiantao, Hubei, China in September 2017 and April July 2018, the processing results of which show that the proposed model is superior to the power law and the log law models, especially near the side wall (narrow channel region). River discharges calculated by this method are highly consistent with those provided by Hubei Xiantao hydrologic station, which verifies the reliability of the model and the feasibility of using UHF radar to measure natural river discharge continuously and automatically.

AB Industrialization and urbanization expansion may change the groundwater quality in the Pearl River Delta (PRD). The aims of this study were to evaluate the groundwater quality in various aquifers and areas with different urbanization levels in the PRD, to extract the main impact indicators, and to discuss the driving forces for the groundwater quality. Nearly 400 groundwater samples were collected and 23 indicators were analyzed. In the PRD, 83% groundwater was drinkable (good-quality) by using a fuzzy synthetic evaluation method. Groundwater in karst aquifers was drinkable, and its quality was better than those in granular and fissured aquifers. In the latter two aquifer types, groundwater quality in non-urbanized areas was much better than those in peri-urban and urbanized areas. In granular aquifers, Mn + Fe, I- + Ni + Mn, and Mn + As + I- were the main impact indicators for poor-quality groundwater in urbanized areas, peri-urban areas, and non-urbanized areas, respectively. Correspondingly, reductive dissolution of Fe/Mn (oxy)hydroxides, infiltration of industrial wastewater and reductive dissolution of I- and Mn, and reductive dissolution of Mn, As, and I- were likely responsible for poor-quality groundwater in these areas, respectively. By contrast, in fissured aquifers, NO3-, NO3- + Pb, and I- were the main impact indicators for poor-quality groundwater in urbanized areas, peri-urban areas, and non-urbanized areas, respectively. Correspondingly, infiltration of domestic sewage, infiltration of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater, and mineralization of I-rich organic matter were probably responsible for poor-quality groundwater in these areas, respectively. Industrialization was one of the main driving forces for groundwater quality in granular and fissured aquifers in peri-urban areas, while urbanization was one of the main driving forces for groundwater quality in fissured aquifers in urbanized and peri-urban areas in the PRD.

AB It is challenging to predict groundwater level (GWL) accurately and reliably in reclaimed coastal areas, the dynamic of which has been greatly altered by the land reclamation activities, due to its diverse engineering boundaries. In this study, the data-driven Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models (nonlinear input-output network (NIO), nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX), and wavelet-NARX (WA-NARX)) are used to predict the GWL in a newly reclaimed land on Zhoushan Island, China. The models use semi diurnal tide (SDT) and precipitation as input variables, and the wavelet coherence (WTC) is applied to analyze the response of GWL to SDT. The results show that the WA-NARX hybrid model provides better prediction performance, especially for short-term periods. Meanwhile, we also explore the correlations between GWL and SDT in the filled and clay layers by using the WTC and the global coherence coefficient (GCC). The results show strong correlations at 0.5-, 1-, and 15-day time scales (resonance periodicities), which are then used as prediction periods for ANN models. The correlation is stronger for the filled layer than that for the clay layer indicates GWL in the filled layer is more sensitive to SDT, especially at 0.5-day time scale. The predicted results also confirm that SDT and precipitation have great influences on GWL with better prediction in the filled layer.

TI Real-time reservoir flood control operation for cascade reservoirs using

AB The real-time operation of multi-reservoir systems is a vital issue in the field of reservoir management. The uncertainty caused by inflow forecasting means that risk analysis is necessary for such real-time operation. However, differences in the length of the forecast periods for different reservoirs in the system are seldom considered in the risk analysis of multi-reservoir systems. This paper presents a two-stage flood risk analysis method of multi-reservoir systems that takes the differences in the length of forecast lead-times into consideration. The aim of the proposed method is to evaluate the uncertainty of the flood forecasting by dividing the operation horizon into the forecast lead-time and the beyond-forecast time period. The risk within the forecast lead-time is estimated by counting the frequency of failure numbers among all scenarios with the help of the scenario-based forecasts. The risk beyond the forecast time period is determined using reservoir flood routing with the design flood hydrographs, which are selected according to the differences in the length of the forecast periods between any two reservoirs. The proposed two-stage risk analysis method is verified using stochastic simulations method based on Monte Carlo sampling. A real-time flood control operation model is established by taking the proposed two-stage risk analysis method as a constraint. China's Ankang-Danjiangkou Cascade Reservoirs are considered as a case study, and the results indicate that the proposed real-time operation model can increase hydropower generation by 0.22 billion kWh during the summer flood season without increasing the flood risk in the multi-reservoir system. The proposed method enhances our understanding of risk management for the real-time flood control operations in multi-reservoir systems.

AB The urban drainage model is an important tool for the management and decision-making around an urban drainage network. Owing to urban drainage networks' complex distribution, existing model analysis methods have gradually exposed problems of insufficient utilization of spatial information, weak coupling and analytical capacity of multi-source heterogeneous data, and poor human-computer interaction. By coupling an urban drainage model with 3D GIS technology and 3D visualization technology, this study presents a 3D dynamic visualization method of an urban drainage model (3DDVM-UDM). A case study from Chaohu, China, is used to demonstrate the method. The environmental information and distributions of pipe network objects in 3D space were presented. The urban drainage model can be edited and simulated in the 3D environment, and a 2D flooding simulation method was also established. Multiple model results were dynamically and simultaneously visualized in the pipe network entity models. By coupling and comparing the model results under different rainfall return periods, various information was intuitively analyzed, such as the water level and water quality differences of each pipe and node, and the spatial distribution differences of fully filled pipes, overflowed nodes and buildings influenced by node overflow. The operation state of a drainage pipe network can be systematically analyzed by intuitively combining with the attribute information of a pipe network, 3D spatial information and other relevant data. This study provides a feasible theory and method to assist in environmental management and decision-making, to facilitate communication between different fields, and to promote a shift in analysis from 2D to the combination of 2D and 3D.

AB Mongolian pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica) has been widely used in vegetation restoration and for windbreaks in sandy regions of northern China where water is the principal factor limiting tree survival and growth. An understanding of water use in Mongolian pine plantations is critical for effective vegetation restoration. To determine water sources in a Mongolian pine plantation, we investigated the stable isotopic ratios of delta O-18 and delta D in precipitation, groundwater, in soil water in different soil layers, and in tree xylem at different tree ages along a precipitation gradient and in different micro-landforms. The results indicated that the main water sources for Mongolian pine were precipitation-derived shallow soil water in semi-humid regions and that the contribution proportion decreased with an increase in tree age. With reduced precipitation in semi-arid and arid regions, contribution of deep soil water to Mongolian pine water use gradually increased, and differences in soil water contribution among trees due to tree age also significantly increased. Water use patterns in trees planted in different micro-landforms (e.g. sand dune crest or inter-dune lowland) became more distinct as precipitation gradually decreased across humid to semiarid and arid regions. Moreover, Mongolian pine, including 15-, 20-, 25-, and 45-year-old trees, similar height and DBH without groundwater in semi-arid climate (in Ejin Horo banner), while trees planted in extremely arid climate (Linze) relied on irrigation for survival despite abundant and available groundwater at that study site. These results indicated that groundwater may be beyond reach to be a main water source for Mongolian pine trees. Soil water conditions determined the survival and sustainable growth of planted trees, especially at depths less than 1 m where soil layers were recharged mainly by precipitation. Although Mongolian pine exhibits strong ecological adaptability, a trait that makes it ideally-suited for controlling desertification in sandy regions of northern China, water stress, crown dieback, or even tree mortality are likely to occur under conditions of extremely low precipitation.

AB Biochar has been increasingly used as an amendment to enhance soil structure and improve soil hydraulic properties. Nevertheless, there are very limited physically based studies to investigate solute transport in biochar-amended soils at pore scale. In this study, for the first time, synchrotron-based X-ray micro-computed tomography (SR-mu CT) was used to obtain high-resolution pore geometries of two clayey soils and their biochar amended samples, then the three-dimensional lattice Boltzmann (LB) method was implemented to simulate solute transport using the pore structure information. By using the innovative method of combining SR-mu CT and LB simulation, we found that biochar amendment reduced the spatial variability of pore water velocity and increased the dispersion coefficient by one order of magnitude. In addition, we observed that anomalous dispersion was more likely to occur in soils with biochar amendment. Furthermore, soils after biochar amendment had relatively higher thresholds of both the transition zone and advection-dominated zone for the dispersion coefficients. These results are crucial in understanding nutrient transport processes and contaminant migration occurring at pore scale.

AB The Wenchuan area has become highly susceptible to landslides and debris flows since the earthquake occurred on 2008. A detailed debris flow hazard assessment is necessary to provide information for future risk management. Debris flow runout on a depositional fan is an important factor for assessing debris flow hazard, and its estimate becomes essential for the planning of the mitigation works that must be built. We therefore developed two simple empirical relationships based both on univariate and multivariate approaches, which provide the runout distance using the data for 134 channelized debris flow events in 134 catchments in the Wenchuan earthquake zone. We generated a correlation matrix of the debris flow runout distances and the relevant variables. Because of the high correlations, the independent variable debris flow volume (V-D) was selected for the univariate approach. Using a multicollinearity analysis and a stepwise regression technique, the catchment (basin) internal relief (H), and V-D were used to develop a multivariate runout relationship. The coefficients of the variables were obtained using 80% of the dataset (training dataset); the remaining 20% was used for test of estimated performance by comparing the computed runout distances with observed values. The validation demonstrated that the proposed relationships are suitable for estimating the runout distances of debris flows on depositional fans in the Wenchuan earthquake zone. The univariate runout relationship has the advantage of being simple, whereas the multivariate runout relationship provides higher accuracy. Additionally we rearranged and reformulated existing relationships using the same training dataset and compared the results with those from the relationships here proposed. The estimations provided by our relationships were the closest to the observed values. The presented approaches may be applied to estimate debris flow runout distances in other areas after they are retrained using local datasets.

AB Following the scheme of the groundwater-soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (GSPAC), a simple process-based model (SiTH; Simple Terrestrial Hydrosphere) was developed to estimate the dynamics of terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) at the daily step. The input data include net radiation, air temperature, precipitation, leaf area index, vegetation type and soil data, most of which are readily available. Locally, the model performed well in simulating the dynamics of ET and soil moisture over selected FLUXNET sites. Globally, the daily 0.25 degrees ET and groundwater table depth estimations in year 2005 were determined using available gridded datasets. The spatial pattern was reasonable and the range of values corresponded well with other global ET and groundwater table depth products. In future studies, we will produce a long-term daily 0.25 degrees global ET and groundwater table depth products that spans from 1984 to present by using different input datasets.

AB Accurate water level forecasts during flood events are crucial to mitigate the loss of human lives and economic damages. However, the accuracy of flood models can be affected by various factors, including the complexity of the terrain geometry and bathymetry, imperfect physics as well as uncertainties in the inflows and parameters. This paper describes a practical implementation of an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) based data assimilation system that is aimed towards enhancing the forecasting skill of flood models. The system was implemented and tested with a real world dam break flood, based on the experimentally scaled Toce River valley flood that occurred on July 8th, 1996. Water depth data are available for assimilation from a network of 21 sensors distributed across the domain. Our results demonstrate that assimilating data into the flood model significantly improves the model prediction by up to 90% after assimilation and 60% during forecasting. Assimilating the data more frequently significantly enhances the system performances. Estimating the two-dimensional Manning coefficient together with the model's dynamical variables (water depth and velocities) further improves the model prediction skill. Overall, our results suggest that assimilating data into the flood model, while jointly inferring the state and (poorly known) parameters, using an EnKF may provide an efficient framework for developing an operational flood forecasting system.

AB Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) represents the optically active component of the DOM pool, and originates from both allochthonous and autochthonous sources. The fluorescent characteristics of dissolved organic matter (FDOM) has been widely used to trace CDOM sources and infer its composition. However, little is known about the optical and fluorescent properties of CDOM in drinking water reservoirs, and the variability of CDOM properties along trophic gradients in these aquatic systems. A total of 536 water samples were collected between 2015 and 2017 from 131 reservoirs across China to characterize CDOM and FDOM properties using both light absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies, and examine relationships with water-quality condition as expressed by the modified trophic state index (TSIM) of the reservoirs (range: 12 < TSIM < 78). With increased reservoir trophic status, CDOM absorption coefficients at 254 nm (a(CDOM)(254)) and total fluorescence of FRI-EEMs (excitation-emission matrix coupled with fluorescence regional integration) increased significantly (p < 0.01). Our results indicated that the nutrients in aquatic systems and the social economy factors (including wastewater, sewage, cultivated land, GDP, population) and altitude affect the CDOM absorption and fluorescence significantly (p < 0.05). Most importantly, we proposed a new classification standard associated with eutrophic status via CDOM humification index (HIX) due to the significant correlation between each other (p < 0.01). HIX less than 4 was corresponding to TSIM less than 30 as oligotrophic states; 4 < HIX <= 12 was corresponding to TSIM less than 50 as mesotrophic states; 12 < HIX <= 18 was corresponding to TSIM less than 70 as eutrophic states; HIX more than 18 is defined as hypereutrophic status with TSIM > 70. This method highlights the importance of CDOM fluorescence for aquatic DOM input and strengthens the linkage between the trophic status index and CDOM characteristics, it also contributes to establish a new rapid assessing model with quick experimental measurements to monitor the trophic status of water reservoirs.

AB Joint multifractal spectrum analysis (JMS) is an effective approach for investigation of relationship among hydrological variables and is regarded as one potential way to reveal nonlinear relationship in hydrology. In this study, the joint multifractal spectrum analysis was for the first time used to analyze soil moisture-soil temperature-precipitation (SM-ST-P) relationship. Pearson's linear correlation coefficient considering lag effects and scale effects was also applied for the aims of comparison. Soil data were collected at four sites in Tibet and three depths for each site (10 cm, 30 cm and 60 cm) at 2-hourly frequency from November 2016 to November 2017. Correlation analysis showed that the coefficients varied at every measurement point but failed to provide general and comprehensive analysis of SM-ST-P relationship. On the contrary, multifractal spectra of SM-ST-P confirmed that the relationship was strong for all measurement points. Furthermore, JMS analysis provided holistic results including verification of multifractal of SM-ST-P relationship, relationship evaluation for each part of variables separately (high value, middle value, low value), intuitive diagrammatic comparison of SM-ST and SM-P relationships, etc. Seasonal JMS analysis was adopted to investigate the freezing-thawing process in the study area as well. The multifractal spectra of frozen soil site and no frozen soil site are totally different for dry cold period but similar for rainy warm period. The difference in multifractal of SM-ST-P relationship with and without frozen soil presented the latent application of JMS to quantitatively detect the process of frozen soil. This study implied the capability of JMS analysis in hydrology, especially for multivariable relationship like SM-ST-P relationship.

AB Nitrate in groundwater is increasing in many aquifers worldwide due to excessive use of fertilizers. However, the behavior of N-based fertilizer as it leaches through thick vadose zones is still poorly understood, and the longterm effects on groundwater quality in such settings may yet to be fully realized. In this study, deep soil cores were taken below experimental plots where N-fertilizer was applied for nearly 20 years under wheat-maize double cropping in the North China Plain (NCP). N-fertilizer application rates of zero, 400, and 600 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1) were applied to different plots. Water and N balances were quantified to estimate the leaching rate of NO3- -N below the root zone, and NO3-N loss via denitrification. Transport pathways of nitrate in the vadose zone were identified using stable isotopes of water (delta O-18-H2O & delta H-2-H2O) and nitrate (delta O-18-NO3 & delta N-18-NO3-) from the sampled pore-water and groundwater. The average N transport velocity through the vadose zone ranged from 38 to 41 cm yr(-1) and was relatively constant regardless of fertilizer application rate. The transport rates are significantly lower than the long-term rate of groundwater level decline (100 cm yr(-1)), meaning it is unlikely much of the leachate from chemical N-fertilizers (abundantly applied throughout the region since the 1970s) has entered groundwater via matrix flow. Nitrate isotopes appear to indicate that manure and septic waste (not chemical N-fertilizer) are the major sources of nitrate in groundwater to date. However, stable isotopes show that increased nitrate concentrations in groundwater may also result due to preferential flow in sand layers and/or lateral flow from headwater areas. Denitrification (particularly in the upper 4 m depth of soil) appears to have limited the flux of fertilizer-derived nitrate to some degree. However, the large N stock and generally weak denitrification potential in the deep unsaturated zone, pose a major threat to future groundwater quality. The results have major implications for groundwater quality management in the future.

AB Debris is known to influence the ablation, topography and hydrological systems of glaciers. This paper determines for the first time how these influences impact on bulk water routing and the proglacial runoff signal, using analyses of supraglacial and proglacial water chemistry and proglacial discharge at Miage Glacier, Italian Alps. Debris does influence the supraglacial water chemistry, but the inefficient subglacial system beneath the debris-covered zone also plays a role in increasing the ion contribution to the proglacial stream. Daily hydrographs had a lower amplitude and later discharge peak compared to clean glaciers and fewer diurnal hydrographs were found compared to similar analysis for Haut Glacier d'Arolla. We attribute these observations to the attenuating effect of the debris on ablation, smaller input streams on the debris-covered area, a less efficient subglacial system, and possible leakage into a raised sediment bed beneath the glacier. Strongly diurnal hydrographs are constrained to periods with warmer than average conditions. 'Average' weather conditions result in a hydrograph with reverse asymmetry. Conductivity and discharge commonly show anti-clockwise hysteresis, suggesting the more dilute, rapidly-routed melt component from the mid-glacier peaks before the discharge peak, with components from higher up-glacier and the debris-covered areas arriving later at the proglacial stream. The results of this study could lead to a greater understanding of the hydrological structure of other debris-covered glaciers, with findings highlighting the need to include the influence of the debris cover within future models of debris-covered glacier runoff.

AB Accurate and reliable measurements of field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-fs) are essential for accurate determinations of soil and solution water fluxes. K(fs)( )is a crucial parameter to design drainage, irrigation systems and many other environmental, agricultural and industrial installations Reynolds et al. (1983). There is a high demand for K-fs data. Its evaluation is preferable to be done in situ. A popular device to measure the K-fs is the head well permeameter such as the Guelph Permeameter. However, it is an analog equipment based on a Mariotte's bottle that requires full attention and training to be manually operated, where the reading of the flux values (Q, in cm(3)/min) is time-consuming and costly. In this paper, we describe a device, with a digital readout, to measure the steady state rate of water level change Rs, in order to obtain Q(s) and K-fs. The method is based on the monitoring of the vacuum variation of the Mariotte's bottle. Our results show no statistical differences between the measurements values of manual and automatic recording using paired t-test. In addition, our device identifies measurement artifacts due to the variation of the ambient temperature during measurements. The necessary accuracy for the digitalization method becomes feasible due to the availability of accurate piezoelectric transducers (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System - MEMS). Automating and digitizing these processes will reduce time, costs and increase the accuracy and availability of data. The device can be directly adapted to commercially available head well permeameters as shown in our experimental results. The more widespread use and understanding of this parameter can improve the rational use of water for irrigation and use in risk models for forecasting available soil water and therefore crop productivity.

Several studies have demonstrated that pollutant removal performance can be improved when plants are included in bioretention design; however, while numerous benefits of trees in urban areas have been identified, little knowledge of their contributions to stormwater management in green infrastructure currently exists. To address this need, a controlled mesocosm experiment was conducted to characterize the degree of stormwater treatment provided by bioretention columns planted with one of three native tree species commonly found across the eastern United States (Ater rubrum - red maple, Pinus taeda - loblolly pine, and Quercus palustris - pin oak). Tree pollutant removal performance was compared to nonvegetated mesocosms using a semi-synthetic stormwater mixture applied to the mesocosms over a period of 17 weeks. The hydrologic benefits of each species were characterized using data-logging scales placed below the mesocosms to compare evapotranspiration (ET) rates and drainage in each configuration. Differences in pollutant removal between tree species were largely not significant, indicating the dominant role of the bioretention media in mitigating dissolved and particle-bound constituents. Mesocosms planted with red maple (Acer rubrum) had significantly greater average ET rates (3.2 mm d(-1)) than all other configurations, attributable to plant development and increased growth and canopy size. All mesocosms planted with trees had significantly higher ET rates than the nonvegetated mesocosms, illustrating the role of transpiration in bioretention hydrology which, depending on species, accounted for 8.2-37.5% of average daily water losses from the mesocosms during testing. These results suggest that trees contribute to bioretention hydrology through evapotranspiration, and that significant differences between species exist and are likely related to growth rate.

AB A large part of total solid flux is transported as suspension in mountainous rivers. It is crucial for water resource management and for environmental issues to be able to model and to understand these fluxes. However, suspended load is known to be highly variable in time and space, as fine sediments can originate from various erosion processes and from various sources. Among the different methodologies available for analyzing the suspended sediment flux dynamics, hysteretic loops in discharge and suspended load signals are commonly used to assess sediment sources and production processes. However, the shape of these loops is often analyzed qualitatively for a single or a small number of catchments. Hence it is still unclear how the geomorphological catchment properties influence the variability of the flow rate - suspended sediment concentration relationship through the hysteresis effects. This is particularly true in mountainous catchments where important sources of fine sediments may originate from the river bed in addition to hillslopes.
   In this study we analyzed quantitatively ten long-term series of high-frequency observations of suspended sediment load measured in contrasted alpine catchments. Hysteresis effects were analyzed in a high number of automated sampled events and the dominant response for each catchment was sought. This was done by using a normalized hysteresis index developed by Lloyd et al. (2016), which we weighted by the mass transported during each event. The various catchments were characterized with a normalized geomorphological index expressing the relative importance of sediment sources originating from the river bed or from eroded areas as a function of the distance to the outlet of the catchment.
   The dominant hysteresis response of the ten alpine catchments studied was found to be greatly linked to their geomorphological index. These results suggest that the sediment source configuration upstream of a measuring station drives hysteresis effects and thus the variability of the flow rate-suspended sediment concentration relationship.

AB This study focused on the utility of coarse surface soil moisture observations for applications that require high resolution surface soil moisture information. This was accomplished by quantifying the information content of average soil moisture for three different spatial scales of 81 km(2), 790 km(2), and 4400 km(2). In situ point observations of soil moisture from 31 stations in Iowa were used to develop a spatial stochastic model that assumes hillslope-scale model parameters are independent. Soil moisture dry-downs and wetting regimes were analyzed using rain gauge and soil moisture sensor data. The statistical nature of dry-downs were parameterized using a power-law decay, and soil moisture increases due to rainfall were parameterized using a non-dimensional logistic curve that is a function of soil moisture deficit. The resulting stochastic model is used to quantify the magnitude of the standard deviation, sigma(theta), and skewness G(theta) as a function of the areal average. We show that the greatest information content (small spatial standard deviation) of average observation corresponded to values near the minimum or the maximum soil moisture with sigma(theta) < 5%, while average observations for intermediate soil moisture values had the lowest information content with sigma(theta) > 20%. The differences in information content as a function of the areal average were consistent with the statistical nature of soil moisture that can be interpreted as small range bounded variable. However, this study provides quantitative estimates for the magnitude of the sub-grid and basin scale variability, documenting the utility for applications that require high resolution information. These results form the basis for the investigation of spatial runoff production in response to rainfall and to inform plot scale agriculture applications.

AB Hydrological modelling is a challenging and significant issue, especially in nonhomogeneous catchments in terms of geology, and it is an essential part of water resources management. In this study, daily rainfall-runoff modelling was carried out using the lumped conceptual model, the artificial neural network (ANN), the deep-neural network (DNN), and regression tree (RT) data mining models for the nonhomogeneous karst Ljubljanica catchment and four of its sub-catchments in Slovenia with different geological characteristics. Model performance was evaluated using several performance criteria and additional investigation of low and high flows was carried out. The results of the study indicate that the Genie Rural a 4 parametres Journalier (GR4J) lumped conceptual model yielded better modelling performance compared to the data-driven models, namely ANN, DNN and RT models. Moreover, the enhanced version of the GR4J model (i.e. GR6J) also yielded good performance in terms of the recession part. The RT model yielded the worst performance regarding runoff forecasting among the examined models in the case of all five investigated catchments. However, ANN and DNN data-driven models were slightly more successful in modelling the hydrograph recession in the case of karst sub-catchments compared to the GR4J lumped conceptual model structure. Inclusion of additional meteorological variables to ANN and DNN does not significantly improve modelling results.

   approach; Climate change impact assessment; Realistic perturbed

ID EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; OPTIMIZATION
AB Scenario-neutral approaches are used increasingly as a means of stress-testing climate-sensitive systems to a range of plausible future climate conditions. To ensure that these stress-tests are able to explore system vulnerability, it is necessary to generate hydrometeorological time series that represent all aspects of plausible future change (e.g. averages, seasonality, extremes). A promising approach to generating these time series is by inverting the stochastic weather generation problem to obtain weather time series that capture all the relevant statistical features of plausible future change. The objective of this paper is to formalize this "inverse" approach to weather generation, by both characterizing the process of optimizing weather generator parameters and proposing a numerically efficient solution that exploits prior knowledge and accounts for the complexity of the optimization landscape. The proposed approach also provides a structured way to ensure the physical realism of the generated weather time series, by using penalty-based objective functions to focus the optimization on the climate features deemed most relevant to the system being analyzed. A case study in Adelaide, Australia, is used to demonstrate specific implementations of this approach. The use of bounds on the weather generators dramatically decreases the time taken to create time series, and the use of penalties is shown to allow for change in some statistics to be prioritized, while still ensuring the realism of the time series.

AB In drylands, evapotranspiration (ET) is the dominant ecohydrologic process. For this reason, partitioning of ET-determining the relative importance of interception (I), soil evaporation (E), and plant transpiration (T)-is critical, but remains a challenge. Recently, however, advances in measurement technologies and data availability have triggered an upsurge in in situ studies focused on quantifying T/ET. We carried out a meta-analysis of 38 datasets drawn from 31 studies done in drylands worldwide. This analysis showed that over the growing season, E and T are roughly equivalent for most natural ecosystems, whereas T/ET is higher in irrigated agro-ecosystems. With respect to factors controlling variations in T/ET, we found (1) no clear correlation for annual precipitation, soil texture, or ecosystem type; (2) leaf area index is a more significant controlling factor than fractional cover; and (3) T/ET varies most during dynamic wetting-drying episodes. We also found that controlling factors are different for E and T. Because these two processes differ in temporal dynamics, the factors controlling ET partitioning vary with temporal scale. Further, when interception and shallow groundwater are substantial, including these factors is essential for accurate T/ET quantification. The isotopic approach, especially using laser spectroscopy, is now indispensable for such studies. However, issues related to sampling protocols and quality assurance still must be resolved. We propose three promising areas for future studies in drylands: (1) isotopic sampling of vadose-zone water vapor using laser spectroscopy; (2) improved definition/identification of diffusive pathways; and (3) robust upscaling from incongruent hydrometric and isotopic measurements.

AB This study deals with the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time to soil hydraulic parameters through a heterogeneous soil profile, which is often required in many applications such as designing a monitoring network, developing a remediation strategy for contaminated sites, and determining the associated risks of subsurface contamination. The main objective is to determine relative contributions to the output uncertainty of advective travel time from individual input stochastic hydraulic parameters. A new approach is developed to examine the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time to saturated hydraulic conductivity and macroscopic capillary drive as a result of infiltration from a wet and contaminated surface source. The approach can be applied to both non-stationary layered formation and stationary soil profile. The results demonstrate that the advective contaminant travel time is sensitive to the layers with small saturated hydraulic conductivity and small macroscopic capillary drive values. Larger uncertainty of saturated hydraulic conductivity and macroscopic capillary drive shifts the sensitive layers to the advective travel time to deeper layers. Correlation range of saturated hydraulic conductivity and macroscopic capillary drive has less significant impact on the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time than the standard deviation. In the stationary saturated hydraulic conductivity and macroscopic capillary drive profile, although the advective contaminant travel time increase significantly for fine textured soil compared to coarse textured soil, the fractional contribution of spatial locations to the overall uncertainty of total advective travel time is virtually identical for both fine textured and coarse textured soils.

AB The September 12, 2016 Gyeongju earthquakes (M-L = 5.1 of foreshock and My = 5.8 of mainshock) had significant effects on groundwater systems along the Yangsan Fault System composed of NNE-trending, right-lateral strike-slip faults in Korea. Hydrological changes induced by the earthquakes are important because no surface ruptures have been reported and few earthquakes usually occur in Korea. The main objective of this research was to propose a conceptual model interpreting the possible mechanisms of groundwater response to the earthquakes based on anomalous hydrogeochemical data including isotope concentrations with lithostratigraphic classification. For this, annual monitoring data (groundwater level, temperature, and electrical conductivity) and collected data (hydrochemical parameters, radon-222, and strontium isotopes) were used. Groundwater level anomalies could be attributed to the movement of the epicentral strike-slip fault. Radon concentration data showed the potential of groundwater mixing processes. Strontium anomalies could be related to the lithology and stratigraphy of the bedrock, reflecting the effect of water-rock interaction. Using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) statistical analysis, associations of hydro-geochemical characteristics among groundwater wells were interpreted. By combining the grouped results of the SOM with lithostratigraphic unit data, 21 groundwater wells were classified into four groups, each corresponding to different hydrogeological behaviors. A new comprehensive conceptual model was developed to explain possible mechanisms for the hydrological and geochemical responses in each group, which have been respectively identified as water-rock interaction, mixing of shallow and deep aquifers via sea water intrusion, bedrock fracture opening related to strike-slip fault movement, and no response.

AB New and improved drought models based on the World Meteorological Organization approved Standardized Precipitation Index, principally at multiple timescale horizons, are providing significant benefits to the hydrological community, by its widespread acceptance in the sub-field of water resources management, sustainable water use and precision agriculture. In this research paper, the existing challenges faced by a drought forecasting model trained at multiple time-scales are resolved where a new multi-phase, multivariate empirical mode decomposition model integrated with simulated annealing and Kernel ridge regression algorithms (Le., MEMD-SAKRR) is designed to attain significantly accurate drought forecasts for 3 agricultural sites (Le., Faisalabad, Islamabad and Jhelum, located in Pakistan). Utilizing the multi-scalar Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) time series as a target variable for characterization of drought, twelve multivariate datasets (derived from statistically significant lagged combinations of precipitation, temperature & humidity), that are enriched with eight synoptic-scale climate mode indices and periodicity, are utilized in designing a new drought model. The study constructs a hybrid MEMD-SA-KRR model, where firstly, the data are partitioned into their respective training and testing subsets after creating historically lagged SPI at timescale (t-1). Secondly, the MEMD algorithm is conditioned to demarcate multivariate climate indices from their training and testing sets, separately, into their decomposed intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and residues. Thirdly, the SA method is employed to decide the most suitable IMFs. Finally, the KRR algorithm is applied to the selected IMFs to forecast multi-scaler SPI, at 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-monthly forecast horizon. The results are benchmarked with Random Forest, integrated with MEMD and SA to develop the MEMD-SA-RF equivalent model. The multi-phase MEMD-SA-KRR model is tested geographically in Pakistan, revealing that the MEMD-SA-KRR hybrid model generates reliable performance in forecasting multi-scaler SPI series, relative to the comparative models based on error analysis metrics. The hybrid drought model incorporating the most pertinent synoptic-scale climate drivers, as the model inputs has significant implications for hydrological applications and water resources management including its potential use in drought policy and drought recovery plans.

AB In a semi-arid climate, groundwater-fed endorheic lakes often have shallow depths and large areas of associated wetlands. These lake-wetland-aquifer systems are sensitive to land use and climate changes. Difficulties of modeling such systems include (a) tracking several thousand lakes and wetlands (LWs), and (b) evaluating major drivers of trends and fluctuations in LW areal coverage. Integrated hydrologic modeling of such systems is prohibitively expensive. We combine traditional groundwater flow modeling (MODFLOW), driven by modern and projected groundwater recharge (GR) estimates, with digital elevation model (DEM)-based geographic information system (GIS) terrain analyses. This approach can be a useful diagnostic tool for estimates of decade-averaged LW areas and numbers, and stream baseflow, facilitating conceptualization and design of more detailed modeling studies. We apply the approach to simulate dynamics of thousands of groundwater-fed LWs in the Nebraska Sand Hills, USA, under GCM-projected GR changes. Compared to the baseline period of 2000-2009, the model indicates an increase by 35% (from 2083 to 2804 km(2)) of decade-averaged LW area by the end of the 21st century under the Median GR projection, with GR averaging 55.3 mm/yr from 2010 through 2099 (5% increase). Under the same GR projection, the overall numbers of LW is simulated to increase by 18% (from 7331 to 8666). The uncertainty range in the hydrologic response of the system caused by differences among GR projections (Wet and Dry) are also evaluated.

TI Reduction of flood risk in Europe - Reflections from a reinsurance

ID CLIMATE; HAZARD
AB Damage caused by floods has generally increased in Europe over the decades, and reducing the flood risk has become a recognised priority throughout the continent. Floods constitute a burden on the economies of European countries and insurance companies, not only because of the damage they cause but also because of the costs of structural flood defences and safety measures in general. The main reasons for the increasing flood risk are: presence of settlements and the growing value of assets in flood-prone areas; climate and environmental (land use and land cover) changes that always happen but have recently been accelerated because of radically different demographic conditions and technological progress. Statistical analyses by Munich Re's NatCatSERVICE database underline the high relevance of floods to European societies. The reasons for the rising trends in flood losses are explained. The flood risk is borne by various stakeholders - individuals, businesses, governments and the insurance sector. This paper discusses the taxonomy of floods, presents flood statistics for Europe and examines the reasons for flood risk increase. It also examines flood risk reduction, focusing on various aspects of flood insurance as a means of risk transfer.

AB The knowledge of the rainfall drop size distribution (DSD) at the land surface is essential for understanding precipitation mechanisms affecting soil erosion processes. Rainfall erosivity is defined as the potential of rain to cause erosion and it can be evaluated by rainfall kinetic power, which is determined by DSD and raindrop terminal velocity.
   This paper firstly deals with the raindrop terminal velocity estimate. Then the most widely used DSD are reviewed highlighting the difference between the raindrop size distribution per unit volume of air and that per unit area and time. The reliability of the available kinetic power-rainfall intensity relationships and their application in several part of the world is discussed, highlighting that the use of rainfall intensity is not sufficient to determine the rainfall kinetic power everywhere. Finally, the influence of seasonality on both raindrop size distribution and rainfall energy characteristics is investigated using DSD measurements carried out by an optical disdrometer placed at Palermo experimental area.

AB In practice, the rational operation rule derived from historical information and real-time working condition can help the operators make the quasi-optimal scheduling plan of hydropower reservoirs, leading to significant improvements in the generation benefit. As an emerging artificial intelligence method, the extreme learning machine (ELM) provides a new effective tool to derivate the reservoir operation rule. However, it is difficult for the standard ELM method to avoid falling into local optima due to the random determination of both input-hidden weights and hidden bias. To enhance the ELM performance, this research develops a novel class-based evolutionary extreme learning machine (CEELM) to determine the appropriate operation rule of hydropower reservoir. In CEELM, the k-means clustering method is firstly adopted to divide all the influential factors into several disjointed sub-regions with simpler patterns; and then ELM optimized by particle swarm intelligence is applied to identify the complex input-output relationship in each cluster. The results from two reservoirs of China show that our method can obtain satisfying performance in deriving operation rules of hydropower reservoir. Thus, it can be concluded that the model's generalization capability can be improved by isolating each subclass composed of similar dataset.

AB Theories and models used in soil hydrological sciences rely on the knowledge of the spatially and temporally variable soil hydraulic properties, i.e. the water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves. Obtaining reliable experimental information on these curves for an area of interest is not easy and it still remains a challenge for soil scientists. In 2006, a simple and physically based methodology was proposed to completely characterize the soil using a single ring infiltration experiment in the field and determination of soil particle size distribution, initial and final soil water content and dry soil bulk density. This methodology, named BEST - Beerkan Estimation of Soil Transfer parameters, has received great attention and interest from the worldwide scientific community and it shows promise for further developments. This review paper aims to take the reader into the BEST world. Initially, the BEST experiment is described and the different algorithms that can be applied to analyze the infiltration data are illustrated. Then, an overview of the use that has been made of BEST up to now in the world is provided. Subsequently, infiltration prediction by BEST equations is discussed from both a theoretical and a practical point of view, i.e. with reference to the shape and geometric parameters of the assumed infiltration model and to the effects of the available information for the transient and steady-state phases of the process. Then, the application of BEST is presented with reference to different types of heterogeneous soils. Finally, practical recommendations and theoretical and experimental perspectives are provided.

AB The groundwater storage of China's Alxa Plateau (AP), one of the driest plateaus in the World, with a mixed landscape of deserts, including the Gobi, natural riparian oases and mosaic groundwater-fed irrigation areas, is vulnerable to global climate change and enhanced human activities. In this study, we revealed the temporal and spatial pattern of the changes in groundwater storage (GWS) across the AP by integrating satellite observations, hydrological modelling and ground data during the period of 2003-2016. Our results showed the GWS experienced a significant decreasing trend across the AP, while the precipitation did not significantly change. GWS continues to decrease in the center of the AP, i.e., the Badain Jaran Desert, which is likely associated with the fact of increasing evapotranspiration. The anthropogenic influences were reflect as the long-term extraction of groundwater has strongly depleted the GWS in the southeastern AP; however, in the northwestern part of the AP, groundwater depletion has been relieved due to the water diversion project with general increasing river runoff. Furthermore, based on our analysis and a broad review of the studies in other sub-regions over the AP, the possible regional flow path was proposed with particular addressing on the likely influence by anthropogenic activities. The dynamics in the GWS among the different hydrogeological units is likely interconnected through regional groundwater flow paths. Decreasing of GWS in the central AP, which would lead to reducing groundwater discharge to the northwestern AP, might further cause the groundwater depletion in the northwestern AP. Our results emphasize the tempo-spatial patterns in GWS change and the associated hydrological and ecological processes across the dry plateau. Identifying and untangling the various processes that impact on groundwater storage would allow us to develop more effective water management strategies.

This study investigates hydropedological patterns in a tropical catchment by understanding soil nutrient and soil surface changes. Soil nutrient concentrations and hydraulic properties were measured from the La Vega micro watershed in the southwestern Colombian Andes at 16 distributed locations in four elevation ranges (between 1450 and 1700 m a.s.l.). The site is a part of a conservation partnerships which implements programs and monitor impacts. Soil samples were analyzed for total nitrogen (TN), Bray II-available phosphorus, exchangeable cations, pH, organic matter, and texture. Soil hydraulic conductivities at two depths (0-5 cm and 5-10 cm) were determined in conservation implementation areas (enclosures and natural regrowth). In the upper elevation range, regrowth of natural vegetation was found on deep soils (similar to 3 m) with moderate infiltration (26 cm hr(-1)), the lowest bulk density (0.92 g cm(-3)), and the highest TN (0.4%). The lowest elevation (mixed land use of grazing and riparian forests with deep profiles) had the lowest infiltration (4 cm hr(-1)), highest bulk density (1.02 g cm(-3)), and the lowest TN (0.26%). In the middle elevation ranges, conserved tropical forest vegetation were located on shallow soil depths with high organic matter (similar to 6%) and high infiltration (86 cm hr(-1)). The lowest infiltration rate average (2.3 cm hr(-1)) exceeded the estimated erosive regional precipitation intensity (similar to 2.5 cm hr(-1)) about 60% of the time, while the median infiltration rate (10 cm hr(-1)) exceeded rainfall intensities 94% of the time, indicating that infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff mechanisms are both present. Coupling data with sediment concentration and solute concentration patterns can help discern correlations between scales and will help to monitor effectiveness of conservation programs aimed at sustaining ecosystem services.

AB Water planner and managers always work in a changing and uncertain environment, since the majority of water resource-related data is imprecise or uncertain to some extent. MCDM (multi-criteria decision making) is a well-suited decision support tool for water resources management, however multiple uncertainties existed in criteria weights (CWs) and performance values (PVs) hinder the application of MCDM methods in real-world problems. This paper proposes an application-oriented stochastic MCDM framework for robust water resources management under uncertainty. A weight aggregation approach based on the game theory coupled with feasible weight space (FWS) is developed for conflict resolution and uncertainty estimation. We propose a novel SMAA-GRA model by combining the stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) theory and grey relational analysis (GRA). The risk of errors in decision making and rank uncertainty degree are utilized to assess decision-making uncertainty. We perform significance analysis to examine the impacts of input parameter uncertainties on the final assessment of alternatives. The proposed framework is demonstrated via two water resources management case studies. Numerical experiments are conducted to investigate the robustness and computational efficiency of the framework as well as the effects of uncertainty level and probability distribution type on decision-making results. The results indicate that the framework enables water managers to examine the robustness of final decisions and allows a risk-informed water resource decision to be made with higher reliabilities.

AB This work adopts a multicriteria approach, combining diverse karst hydrogeology techniques, to investigate the functioning of evaporite-karst systems, which are normally less studied due to the poor quality of their water resources. The applicability of using several methods was also verified. In view of previous experience at a pilot site within southern Spain, the natural responses of the main discharge point of the system of study (Lower Anzur spring) were controlled by continuous monitoring of the discharge rate, water temperature, and electrical conductivity. Water samples were collected for chemical analysis and for the determination of intrinsic fluorescence, water stable isotopes (delta O-18, delta H-2) and tritium (H-3) concentrations. Physico-chemical data were statistically examined applying principal component analysis (PCA) and trend analysis tests (Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope). The system shows a clear karstic functioning, highly dependent on concentrated recharge, and influenced by a limited drainage capacity of the conduit network. The piston-flow effects at the beginning of floods indicate a contribution to the drainage of deep ascending flows through the saturated zone. Subsequent drops in temperature and mineralization values in the water drained by the spring, as well as a recent infiltration deduced from the signature of intrinsic fluorescence and stable isotopes, point to a good hydrogeological connection from the recharge areas to the spring. Later restoration of the initial values of mineralization -in a much shorter time than those of temperature- reveals a faster geochemical evolution of the recently infiltrated groundwater, which may be a distinctive trait of evaporite karst aquifers. Lastly, the high solute content of the spring water in depletion conditions, with ascending trends of mineralization and temperature observed during several dry years as a consequence of lower recharge contribution, together with the tritium activity of selected samples, suggest the existence of an old component partly responsible for the spring base flow. Thus, groundwater would be linked to gravity-driven regional flows, but also to recent conduit flows. All the results obtained led us to devise a hydrogeological conceptual model to precisely reflect the functioning of the studied system. The results presented here demonstrate the advantages of using diverse techniques when investigating evaporite karst aquifers.

AB The relative permeability versus saturation relation is fundamental for modeling unsaturated flow processes in aperture-based fractures. On the basis of the local cubic law and the connectivity probability of aperture distribution within single fractures, an analytical relationship between the relative permeability and saturation is established. When the van Genuchten function on the description of the capillary pressure-saturation relationship is applied, an explicit mathematical expression between the relative permeability and saturation is gained similar to the form of the van Genuchten-Mualem (VG-M) model of porous media. Through the comparisons between the several series of laboratory-measured data available in the literature and theoretical results, good agreements are both presented and they suggest that the proposed VG-M model can be successfully used for aperture-based fractures as well as porous media. To understand aperture variation dependence of the relative permeability properties, a computational method combining fractal theory and the invasion percolation model to determine the empirical parameters associated with the spatial correlation of aperture distribution is developed. Simulated fractures with spatially correlated and uncorrelated aperture distributions corresponding respectively to small and large fractal dimensions are both studied. According to the simulated results, the residual saturation generally increases with fractal dimension increments. However, the value of m exhibits a weak dependence on fractal dimension. The proposed model can be applied to various engineering such as seepage control for rock slopes, petroleum reservoirs, nuclear waste disposal and geologic storage of carbon dioxide.

AB An integrated approach was developed to assess the sustainability, origin, age, evolution, and groundwater potential of large fossil aquifers using the Mega Aquifer System (MAS) (area: 2 x 10(6) km(2)) in the Arabian Peninsula as a test site. A two-step exercise was adopted, the sustainability of the MAS was first investigated through the analysis of GRACE data and land surface model (LSM) outputs. Then, integrated geochemical, remote sensing, and field studies were conducted to address the age, origin, hydrogeological setting, and evolution of the southern sections of the MAS (Rub Al Khali Aquifer System (RAKAS)), the area identified from the analysis of GRACE and ISMs as being the most suited for sustainable development. Analysis of GRACE and ISMs revealed: (1) the MAS central and northern sections are experiencing high groundwater extraction (6.6 km(3)/yr) and depletion rates (-2.8 +/- 0.8 km(3)/yr) with minimum balancing potential through aquifer capture processes, yet sustainability could be achieved by reducing annual extraction by 2.8 km(3), and (2) the MAS southern sections (Rub Al Khali Aquifer System (RAKAS)) are experiencing low groundwater depletion rates (eastern RAKAS: -1.8 +/- 1.4 mm/yr) to steady-state conditions (western RAKAS: -0.73 +/- 1.4 mm/yr). Geochemical, remote sensing, and field investigations over the RAKAS revealed: (1) the presence of west to east trending drainage networks and large-scale groundwater flow systems consistent with a meteoric source (precipitation over Red Sea Hills); (2) increasing Cl-36 model ages along groundwater flow directions (up to 970,000 years), indicating aquifer recharge in wet Pleistocene periods; (3) progressive depletion in the O and H stable isotopic compositions of aquifers with increasing distance from the Red Sea Hills basement outcrops, indicating modest recharge during prevailing dry conditions; and (4) the presence of relatively fresh (TDS: 800-2800 mg/L) and nonradioactive (Ra-226 + Ra-228 < 0.185 Bq/kg) water in western RAKAS. Findings suggest that sustainable agricultural development is achievable at current extraction rates in western RAKAS and provide a replicable and cost-effective model.

AB The magnitude and frequency of hydro-meteorological extremes are expected to increase in a changing environment in ways that threaten the security of US energy-water assets. These include probable maximum precipitation (PMP) and probable maximum flood (PMF), which are used as hydraulic design standards for highly sensitive infrastructures such as nuclear power plants and main dams. To assess the flood vulnerability due to PMP/PMF, an integrated high-resolution process-based hydro-meteorologic modeling framework was used to develop ensemble-based probabilistic flood maps based on best-available historic observations and future climate projections. A graphics processing unit-accelerated 2-dimensional hydrodynamic model was used to simulate the surface inundation areas corresponding to a total of 120 PMF hydrographs. These ensemble-based PMF maps were compared with flood maps obtained from the conventional deterministic PMP/PMF approach, revealing added information about conditional probability of flooding. Further, a relative sensitivity test was conducted to explore the effects of various factors in the framework, such as meteorological forcings, antecedent hydrologic conditions, reservoir storage, and flood model input resolution and parameters. The proposed framework better illustrates the uncertainties associated with model inputs, parameterization, and hydro-meteorological factors, allowing more informed decision-making for future emergency preparation.

TI Transient scour and fill. The case of the Pilcomayo River
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Transient scour; Sediment transport; River morphology; Pilcomayo River
AB Transient scour and fill refers to the general scour and fill in a riverbed due to flood passage. It was given much attention in times of Leopold and Maddock (1953) and Colby (1964) from records of outstanding case studies. Field data from a station in a contracted, long reach of the large sand-bed Pilcomayo River -1192 newly typed in forms- are presented, with sediment concentration in the database up to 60 kg/m(3), mostly wash load. Water surface rises and falls during a flood event, whereas streambed evolves in reverse (it renders the analogy to an accordion). Streambed scouring accounts for 36% of the change in flow area during floods and data reveal scouring up to 4 m from the streambed elevation when flood starts. Velocity data display large hysteresis loops inexplicable by unsteady flow only. Once streambed starts to fall, river bed scour is self-sustaining. Water depth gradient appears to be a crucial variable in a novel equation for transient scour and fill derived from Exner equation. It turns out that flow non-uniformity is relevant to explain transient scour and fill in contrast to flow unsteadiness, which is not. Quasi-steady gradually varied flow equation solved along the contracted reach is the base for a model that captures well the recorded bed evolution. The model explains most of the transient scour and fill by the downstream expansion, but the non-uniform flow and the bed material suspended load also play a role. The model fails on the days of highest sediment concentrations.

AB Seawater intrusion modelling is often used to assist with groundwater management in coastal areas and islands. Although Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) schemes are able to simulate multi-fluid flows in porous media, they have not been widely tested against experimental observations yet. Additionally, numerical methods for groundwater flow problems need to be able to simulate pumping, which is an unexplored area in SPH. In this study, an Explicit Incompressible SPH (EISPH) solver for multi-fluid flow in porous media is used to simulate the dynamics of freshwater lenses in small islands, and is further developed to simulate groundwater pumping and associated seawater upconing. Three methods to implement a sink term that models water pumping from an aquifer are proposed and compared. The model is successfully tested against data from published laboratory-scale experiments and other numerical models. The results of EISPH are comparable to other models. The inclusion of a sink for water particles to simulate pumping did not affect the stability of the simulations, although one of the three methods led to results that better compared to experimental data. Hence, SPH modelling of groundwater flows in porous media can be successfully achieved using the methods developed here.

AB To investigate the seasonal variation of chemical weathering and its controlling factors in the central Tibetan Plateau (TP), hydrochemistry of stream water in two alpine catchments, the Niyaqu and Qugaqie, was studied at an unprecedented temporal resolution from July 2016 to September 2017. Chemical compositions of river water in the two catchments were dominated by Ca2+ and HCO3-center dot SO42- in the stream water mainly derived from sulfide oxidation but sulfuric acid played a minor role in rock weathering compared with carbonic acid. The contributions of atmospheric input, silicate weathering, carbonate weathering and sulfide oxidation to riverine solutes of the Niyaqu, which overlies tuff, sandstone, shale, and carbonate and is mainly recharged by groundwater, were about 5%, 12%, 65%, and 18%, respectively; these contributions to dissolved loads of the Qugaqie, where lithology consists of granite and sandstone and nearly half the stream water originates from glaciers meltwater, were 10%, 35%, 34% and, 20%, respectively. Contribution of different sources to riverine solutes in the Niyaqu were almost invariant between different seasons, while the percentage of these sources in the stream water of the Qugaqie showed significant seasonal variations, especially for the weathering of silicate and carbonate: average value of the former increased from 29% in the monsoon season to 45% during the nonmonsoon period, on the contrary, average value of the latter decreased from 37% to 29% in the corresponding periods. Carbonate weathering rates (CWR) and silicate weathering rates (SWR) in the study areas exhibited distinct seasonal variability. During the monsoon season, the average CWR and SWR values in the Niyaqu were 34.3 t/km(2)/y and 6.8 t/km(2)/y, respectively, and their corresponding values in the Qugaqie were 16.7 t/km(2)/y and 11.0 t/km(2)/y, respectively, which means that the average value of CWR in the Niyaqu during the monsoon season is comparable with the CWR (average for one year) in catchments located in the eastern TP, and the SWR in the Qugaqie during the monsoon season is close to the SWR (average for one year) of some basins at the south slope of the Himalaya. Chemical denudation rates decreased sharply during the nonmonsoon period, indicating little chemical exhumation within that time due to cold and arid weather. Runoff was the most important factor that controls chemical weathering in both the Niyaqu and Qugaqie, followed by physical erosion rates, and the influence of temperature seems to be insignificant in the Niyaqu while at the same time crucial in the Qugaqie.

AB Parametric Budyko method has been widely used to assess water availability under changing environment. Its single parameter (w) controlling the shape of the Budyko curve, is of critical importance to water availability assessment (WAA). Here, the water availability is defined as the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation in the context of Budyko hypothesis. As an unobserved variable, w is generally estimated through incorporating the long-term water-balance model and Budyko hypothesis, i.e. estimating w as a function of precipitation, runoff, and potential evapotranspiration over a long-term time series of these variables. Inevitably, the estimated value of w is subject to uncertainty resulting from hydro-meteorological records with limited size. Further, this uncertainty affects WAA in context of Budyko hypothesis. The uncertainty and its propagation issue is often overlooked in past research. In this paper, we develop a bootstrap-based algorithm to reveal aforementioned uncertainty. Moreover, a partial derivative-based sensitivity analysis is performed for understanding the propagation of w uncertainty on WAA. Three catchments located in the Yellow River Basin, China, are used as case study sites. Results indicate that there exists remarkable uncertainty in parameter w, which varies with the data length. The impact of such uncertainty on WAA increases quickly under the humid condition, thereafter reaches a peak under the mild condition, and decreases slowly under the arid condition. The reason behind this phenomenon is the largest sensitivity of WAA to parameter w under the mild climate condition. Moreover, a general analytical expression for determining the critical value of climate condition which maximizes the impact of parameter w uncertainty on WAA is derived in this paper. Results of this study can enhance the reliability and robustness of Budyko-based models.

AB Adjustment of weather radar estimates using observed precipitation has been an accepted procedure for decades. Ground observations of precipitation typically come from rain gauges, but can also include data from diverse networks of sensors, with different levels of reliability. This study presents a standardized framework for evaluating adjustment algorithms using synthetically constructed, but realistic, rain grids and weather radar rainfall. Ground observation points are randomly placed throughout the synthetic storm domain and the precipitation for each sensor is extracted from the true rain. Then a subset of the sensors are defined as unreliable, and a log-normal error factor is applied at those locations.
   This double network of rain sensors could be applicable, for example, when rainfall is derived from signal attenuation between commercial microwave link (CML) antennas. Past research has tested CML observations as a source of precipitation data and validated various radar adjustment algorithms. However, a comprehensive evaluation of adjustment algorithms using accurate gauge data mixed with CML observations at different densities is lacking.
   Five adjustment algorithms are applied to the synthetic radar grid: Mean Field Bias (MFB), a Multiplicative algorithm, Mixed (additive and multiplicative), Conditional Merge (CondMerge) and Kriging with External Drift (ICED). Generation of the synthetic framework, and application of the adjustment algorithms is repeated for 150 realizations. Comparison of coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error and linear regression for all adjustment procedures over all realizations indicates the following results. Only MFB and KED adjustments performed well when using accurate gauges. The kriging based KED was able to achieve good adjustment also with the addition of error-prone sensors. CondMerge and the Mixed and Multiplicative, however, resulted in poorer adjustments.

AB Unprecedented population growth combined with environmental and energy demands have led to water conflict in the Southeastern United States (SEUS). The states of Alabama, Florida, and Georgia have been engaged in litigation since 1990 on minimum in-stream flows to maintain ecosystems, fisheries and energy demands while satisfying a growing thirst in metropolitan Atlanta. A study of twenty-six unimpaired SEUS (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Tennessee) streamflow stations identified a decreased pattern of flow over the past similar to 25 years with more frequent dry periods being observed in the last several decades. When evaluating calendar year streamflow, a period of high streamflow in the 1970's was followed by a consistent decrease in streamflow from the late 1980's to present. The identification of Atlantic Ocean (AO) Sea Surface Temperature (SST) teleconnections with SEUS streamflow may prove valuable in explaining decadal patterns of streamflow variability. Previous studies have identified the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) as being teleconnected with SEUS precipitation and streamflow. The current research applied the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) statistical method to AO Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) and SEUS streamflow. Annual streamflow volumes from the twenty-six unimpaired SEUS streamflow stations (1952-2016) were selected as the hydrologic response while average AO SSTs were calculated for three different six month averages (January to June or JFMAMJ, April to September or AMJJAS, and July to December or JASOND) for the year (1951-2015) preceding streamflow. The results confirmed an SST region in the North Atlantic as being teleconnected with SEUS streamflow and that an observed multi-decadal increase in temperatures in this SST region may be associated with the observed recent multi-decadal decline in SEUS streamflow.

AB The role of preferential flow through unsaturated saprock (fractured bedrock with weathering restricted to fracture margins) in hillslope hydrology remains inadequately described. To address this issue, ground-penetrating radar (GPR), controlled infiltration, and high-frequency subsurface moisture monitoring were integrated to characterize saprock preferential flow (SPF) in the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory in Pennsylvania, U.S.A. In a planar hillslope with shallow fractured shale bedrock (starting at 0.1-0.3 m below ground), two pulses of water (79.5 L in total) were released followed by time-lapse GPR surveys. Differentiating GPR images collected before and after infiltration revealed lateral SPF in the direction of bedding plane fractures near the infiltration trench but with limited development of SPF down gradient along the hillslope. This was confirmed by soil and saprock moisture monitoring at a soil pit (0.2 m downslope of the GPR grid) where only one out of fifteen probes responded to the controlled infiltration. Lateral SPF frequently occurred at the GPR grid during a 24-day period with ten rainfall events, especially under the wet initial conditions. Additional infiltration experiments in a convex hillslope and a nearby bare slope with exposed saprock demonstrated the impact of fracture patterns on the routing of SPF. Three types of SPF in hillslope hydrology were identified, including (1) vertical percolation, (2) exfiltration from saprock to soil, and (3) stormwater transported downslope from planar and convex hillslopes to concave hillslopes. A 3D fill-and-spill model is proposed for the study site and similar areas that recognizes the importance of subsurface flow networks, with shallow saprock and concave hillslopes as essential controls of hillslope subsurface flow.

AB The description of the floods which have occurred in the past and an assessment of the adverse impacts they have entailed are among the duties required by the European Flood Directive. Indeed, to understand the consequences of a future flood on a city that in the past has already been affected by other flood events, it is very useful to reconstruct the hydraulic effects produced by those events. Such a task is particularly difficult for cases which occurred many years ago. For past events, it is often easier to have conventional hydrological data (for example, the hyetographs of the event) than conventional hydraulic data (recordings of flow rates, water depths, etc.). It is also difficult to obtain the topography valid for the period in which the event occurred. The greater the distance in time the greater the difficulty in gathering these data.
   In this paper we present a criterion for making a flow of information, using various non-conventional sources of information (such as amateur videos, photographs, traditional topographic surveys, news reports, etc.). In particular, it is shown how the data thus obtained can be used together in order to reconstruct numerically the hydraulic dynamics of a flood event in an urban area with a complete hydrodynamic model, which requires a particularly accurate computational domain.
   All these issues will be presented and discussed with reference to the numerical reconstruction of the flood event that occurred 23 years ago (1996) in the city of Crotone (Calabria, Italy).

AB Soil water storage and movement are highly heterogeneous across landscapes and their response to spatio-temporal variations in meteorological forcing is complex. While different pools of soil water (including bound and mobile water) are observed, the mechanisms of soil water movement in semi-arid and sub-humid regions are not well understood due to high variation in soil water storage conditions. The Taihang Mountain is a headwater region that recharges both groundwater and surface water systems of the North China Plain, where groundwater levels have been declining and water storage loss is serious. Increasing land cultivation in the Taihang Mountain areas has increased evapotranspiration and reduced both surface runoff and groundwater recharge. Although extreme precipitation is critical for groundwater recharge in the headwater regions, the response mechanism of soil water movement and groundwater recharge remains unclear. In this study, soil water movement and groundwater recharge mechanisms in a cultivated farmland (FL) and land under natural vegetation (NV) were determined for a normal and an extreme precipitation year through the combined use of soil water content and stable isotopes of water (O-18 and H-2). Soil water got enriched in delta O-18 and delta H-2 (delta O-18 changed from -11.2 to -7.0 parts per thousand at NV and from -11.1 to -4.4 parts per thousand at FL; delta H-2 changed from -71 to -49 parts per thousand at NV and from -73 to - 30% at FL) with increasing soil depth during the growing season suggesting that winter precipitation was generally transported via advection dispersion flow mechanism. However, this process was accompanied by the mixing of previously enriched soil water after large rain events (20-50 mm/day) during the rainy season in a normal precipitation year. Water movement changed from translatory flow to preferential flow after extreme precipitation in a wet precipitation year. Cultivation intensified water evaporation in the top soil layer (upper 10-20 cm), and induced preferential flow down to 50 cm soil depth under FL relative to land under NV. Thus, cropping significantly reduced groundwater recharge. Excessive storm during a wet year produced bypass flow after the first rainstorm, which rapidly recharged deep soil layers (50-100 cm depth). Bypass flow induced by excessive precipitation and contributed the most to groundwater in FL. The observed rapid response of soil water and groundwater to extreme precipitation events is critical for soil and water management to mitigate problems such as nitrate leaching and groundwater contamination in headwater regions of semi-arid and sub-humid areas.

AB Urban flooding is still frequently treated as a direct consequence of excess rainfall, without considering the watershed as an interdependent system connected with the development of its territory. The traditional flood control approach implies in continuous corrective interventions, usually of local character, and resulting from post-events responses. This process requires increasingly large investments to implement (or retrofit) structures capable to accommodate the runoff generated by new urbanized areas. These efforts have not prevented floods from continuing to cause high damages worldwide. Thus, there is a need to change stormwater management strategies, shifting to a risk management approach, not only considering cost-benefit analysis, but also internalizing the residual risk accounting for inherent uncertainties, such as climate change and fast and uncontrolled urban growth. This paper proposes a multi-criteria index, the Urban Flood Resilience index-UFRI, to measure quantitatively urban resilience to floods, supported by a hydrodynamic mathematical model and socio-economic indicators, resulting in spatialized maps as a communicating tool. A case study of an urban watershed in Rio de Janeiro/Brazil is used to demonstrate UFRI potential.

AB In regional hydrogeological models groundwater-surface water interaction is generally represented with a Cauchy boundary condition, in which a conductance parameter governs the exchange flux rate. In some models, the conductance is controlled by the streambed properties, since it has generally a lower hydraulic conductivity than the aquifer. However, depending on the specific system and the spatial discretization of the hydrogeological model, aquifer conductance can be a limiting factor for groundwater-surface water interactions. The present study introduces a new expression to represent the aquifer conductance as a function of aquifer properties, surface water network density and model discretization. This expression is based on the Dupuit-Forcheimer theory, the Ernst equation and vertical 2D numerical experiments at the field scale. The main assumptions used to derive our formulation are the presence of a no-flow boundary at the bottom of the hydrogeological model and the homogeneity of the aquifer. The expression is evaluated using simulations with 3D hydrogeological models at different spatial resolutions and compared against previously published parameterization approaches. The results show that the new expression outperforms the other approaches by capturing accurately both the grid-size and the surface water network density dependency of the conductance, which is caused by pressure head losses due to flow within the aquifer grid cell to the surface water, without any additional numerical calculation. Moreover, the proposed expression can be implemented directly in hydrogeological models thereby improving current approaches to represent groundwater-surface water interactions in regional hydrogeological models.

AB Subsurface dams are widely used to prevent saltwater intrusion around the world. A subsurface dam blocks the groundwater movement both from and towards the sea. This blockage often leads to an accumulation of pollutants and salt on the inland and sea-side of the dam, respectively. While the latter is intended, the former effect is not desired and poses a huge problem in groundwater management. Herein, we propose the use of dams of minimum effective height to prevent saltwater intrusion, and the use of the fresh groundwater discharge to assess the environmental performance of the subsurface dam. Laboratory tests and numerical simulations were used to study the effects of dam height, distance from the saltwater boundary, and head difference on the subsurface dam's saltwater intrusion prevention efficiency and fresh groundwater discharge. We found that i) the fresh groundwater discharge reaches its peak at the minimum dam effective height, and ii) the minimum effective dam height is shorter than the height of SWI without the dam. This means, under the premise of effectively preventing SWI, we can reduce both construction costs and increase fresh groundwater discharge through constructing the dam with the minimum effective dam height. When the dam height was less than the minimum effective dam height, the subsurface dam had little effect in preventing saltwater intrusion. As the dam distance to the shoreline increased, the minimum effective dam height and the peak fresh groundwater discharge decreased simultaneously. A reduction of the dam height is conducive to saving engineering cost, while a reduction of the peak fresh groundwater discharge favors the accumulation of land-based pollutants and salt. Although an increased distance of the dam to the coast seems more economic during construction, this also implies a larger inland soil salinization and accumulation of pollutants. The site selection of subsurface dams is therefore an optimization task that should consider both the engineering cost and ecological environmental effects.

AB The simulation and optimization of low impact development (LID) practices has been a key research topic in stormwater management. In this study, a fast and robust framework was proposed for providing the optimal design of LID practices by coupling a physically based model, the Markov chain, with the multi-objective shuffled frog leaping algorithm (MOSFLA). The proposed framework was then tested for chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction in a typical urban catchment in China. The storm water management model (SVVMM) was used to provide the flow/COD data during the baseline scenario, and the Markov chain method was then incorporated as a subset of the physically based model. Based on the results, the computational efficiency was improved by 500 times when the new framework was used, and the robustness of the optimal results increased over 50% compared to commonly used algorithms. The relative error between the SWMM and the Markov chain method was less than 5%, indicating that a satisfactory performance could be obtained using the proposed framework. This new method provides a useful tool for optimizing LID practices and green infrastructure, especially for complex urban catchments.

AB Offshore fresh groundwater is increasingly suggested as a potential water resource for onshore human demands. In many cases, onshore pumping already draws significant fresh groundwater from offshore. However, offshore aquifers and the extent of offshore freshwater are usually poorly characterised due to data scarcity. This study combines geophysical data, hydraulic information and a first-order mathematical analysis to investigate offshore freshwater extent in the Gambier Embayment (Australia). A large seismic data set, combined with onshore and offshore bore-log geological profiles, are used to explore the regional offshore hydro-stratigraphy. Aquifer hydraulic parameters and onshore heads are obtained from onshore investigations. A novel application of Archie's law, geophysical data and onshore hydrochemical data provide useful insights into the salinity profiles within four offshore wells. These are compared to steady-state, sharp-interface estimates of the freshwater extent obtained from a recently developed analytical solution, albeit using simplified conceptual models. Salinities derived from resistivity measurements indicate that in the south of the study area, pore water with total dissolved solids (TDS) of 2.2 g L-1 is found up to 13.2 km offshore. Offshore pore-water salinities are more saline in the northern areas, most likely due to thinning of the offshore confining unit. The analytical solution produced freshwater-saltwater interface locations that were approximately consistent with the freshwater-saltwater stratification in two of the offshore wells, although analytical uncertainty is high. This investigation provides a leading example of offshore freshwater evaluation applying multiple techniques, demonstrating both the benefit and uncertainty of geophysical interpretation and analytical solutions of freshwater extent.

AB Contaminant transport in the wetland flow is subject to various reactions. Most researches on this topic have limited to the single component contaminant, relatively little has concerned the effect of competitive reaction on the transport of coupled bicomponent contaminant. This work analytically studies the bicomponent contaminant transport in the free surface wetland flow under the combined conditions of reversible competitive transfer, irreversible degradation and bed absorption, by solving the constant-coefficient second-order linear system of parabolic type and the method of concentration moments. Up to the fourth order concentration moment in the previous work (Wang and Chen, 2017a) is applied to support the fourth order expansion of Hermite polynomials to rigorously derive the solutions with high accuracy. The results demonstrate that the masses of binary components decay at different rate, and the vertical concentration distributions of binary components are tremendously non-uniform in the asymptotic dispersion stage. Three types of reactions in addition to the hydraulic dispersion exert separate control on the concentration distributions. It suggests that the peak concentration rather than the mean should be based for strict environmental implements.

AB For a period of 16 months in Sydney, Australia, the variations of H-2/H-1 and O-18/O-16 in atmospheric vapour (delta H-2(A) and delta O-18(A)) were estimated using an evaporation pan method as well as using the isotopic precipitation-equilibrium approach. These calculations were then compared with delta H-2(A) values measured at 10 m above ground surface using a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR). As pan isotopic composition was available on a weekly time scale, the evaporation rates were measured daily, and the atmospheric variables were available hourly, the weekly time scale was used to calculate the arithmetic averages of the atmospheric variables that were used in the estimation of the pan-derived delta H-2(A).
   Good agreement (r = 0.7, P-value = 0.00) was found between the pan-derived and the FTIR measured delta H-2(A) for weekly intervals, although individual differences ranged from similar to 25.0 to 20.4 parts per thousand, with the absolute difference averaging 8.0 parts per thousand. A sensitivity analysis showed that the determination of delta H-2(A) is most sensitive to air temperature, relative humidity and the isotopic composition of the pan water.
   While the precipitation-equilibrium approach only appears to be representative of atmospheric conditions close to times of precipitation events, the pan-derived isotopic composition of atmospheric vapour was found to be closer to the FTIR averages over longer periods including intervals with no precipitation. Overall, this means that the pan method is far more effective for uninterrupted estimation of delta H-2(A) and delta O-18(A) of atmospheric water vapour, as required for water budget studies, than the precipitation-equilibrium method, and it is more cost effective and robust than continuous measurement.

AB This paper proposes an analytical model for predicting the longitudinal profile of depth-averaged streamwise velocities in a channel with an emergent array of rigid cylinders. The governing equation of the analytical model was derived from the momentum equation and flow continuity equation. The longitudinal transect through a flume with a vegetation patch was divided into four regions based on two length scales of flow adjustment upstream of and inside the array, and analytical solutions were proposed for the four regions. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that the array length does not influence flow adjustments near the upstream edge of the array, so the model can predict the longitudinal profile of streamwise velocity for either short or long arrays. Twenty groups of velocity data from different sources were used to verify the proposed model. The predicted velocities agreed well with the measured velocities, indicating that the model is capable of predicting the longitudinal profiles of the velocity upstream of and inside a model patch. The predicted velocity profile can be further employed to estimate regions of enhanced or diminished deposition of fine sediment or organic matter inside model patches.

AB Green roofs are emerging as practical strategies to retain stormwater runoff and improve water environment quality of urban cities. However, the impacts of green roofs on stormwater runoff quality remains a topic of concern to urban planners and mangers. In this study, we designed the scale based runoff plots of extensive green roofs with different substrate and vegetation types, and investigate whether the studied green roofs act as a sink or source of nutrients and suspended solids in their runoff compared to a conventional roof. The influences of substrate and vegetation on the water quality of green roof outflows were also assessed. The results showed that the average TSS (total suspended solids), TN (total nitrogen), and TP (total phosphorus) concentrations of the green roof runoff were all significantly higher than that of the conventional roof runoff. Except substrate S3 (the composition ratio of rural soil:peat soil:perlite:vermiculite was 2.5:5:2:0.5) and S1 (the composition ratio of rural soil: peat soil was 1:1) in TP, the substrate S2 (the composition ratio of rural soil:peat soil:pine needle:perlite was 1:1:1:1) displayed significantly higher TN and TP concentrations than either of the runoff from the substrate S1 and S3. The TN and TP concentrations of 5 cm substrate depth were significantly lower than that in the 15 cm substrate depth treatments. Significant differences were observed in TN concentrations between vegetation Sedum Spectabile and Radix Ophiopogonis. However, no significant differences were observed between any of the vegetation types with regard to TP concentrations. Therefore, we suggest that green roofs need to be constructed of suitable substrate materials and plants based on their function on runoff water quality in order to mitigate the pollution risk of green roof runoff on urban water environment.

AB Urban waterlogging occurs frequently and often causes considerable damage that seriously affects human activities and the economy. Effectively assessing waterlogging susceptibility can reduce or even avoid the damage caused by such disasters. Here, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) was chosen for waterlogging susceptibility assessment due to its simplicity, objectivity, and understandability. The Particle Swarm Optimization method was used to compute parameters of the SVM. When selecting negative samples for machine learning methods, the methods of subjective selection and single random selection used in previous studies made it easy to select improper negative samples, and thus affected the classification accuracy and generalization capacity of the trained classifiers. To overcome these shortcomings, we proposed a repeatedly random sampling and verifying model to select negative samples for an SVM. As such, this study adopted the spatial framework of integrating GIS and an SVM to assess waterlogging susceptibility using the primary urban area of Guangzhou as an example. The results demonstrate that the waterlogging susceptibility map derived from the most accurate classifier (MAC) can reflect the real occurrence and spatial distribution of waterlogging. Moreover, we randomly generated 100,000 groups of samples to test the classification accuracy and generalization capacity of the MAC; the results show that in 82% of the samples, the area under the curve value of the MAC was higher than that of the randomly generated classifier. This demonstrated that the sampling and verifying model can allow the selection of an MAC with a relatively high and stable classification accuracy. The proposed sampling method can overcome the shortcomings of negative sample selection method employed in previous studies, which makes the machine learning results more accurate and reliable. Furthermore, the method requires less data, which can be helpful in developing countries where the availability of long-term intensive hydrologic monitoring data is limited.

AB The waters of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers have always been a vital resource in the water-food-energy nexus of the Middle East region. The currently ongoing Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) in Turkey aims to increase regional prosperity by optimizing the use of these waters for irrigation and hydropower. Since the beginning of the 1990s, the irrigation schemes and water management infrastructures within the scope of the GAP have caused significant land use and land cover (LULC) change in this semi-arid region. We employed a high resolution regional climate model to simulate the effects of irrigation induced LULC changes on the regional water and energy balances. For this purpose, historical simulations were conducted by using three land cover distributions which reflect the increase in irrigation and water surfaces. Our experiment reveals that water loss through evapotranspiration increases significantly with the areal expansion of irrigation. This increase is driven by the change in partitioning of the available energy at the surface between turbulent heat fluxes. On the one hand, a significant reduction in sensible heat flux causes local cooling by around 0.4 degrees C and 0.8 degrees C for the current and future irrigation conditions, respectively. On the other hand, the increase in latent heat flux enhances evapotranspiration and consequently atmospheric water vapor concentration. The moistening of a shallower boundary layer triggers the formation of convective clouds, which increases convective precipitation, most notably during the irrigation months. The enhanced water loss through evapotranspiration has potential to significantly alter the water budget of the GAP region. It seems that the water surplus of the headwaters region may not be enough to meet the water deficit of the GAP region in the future if the planned irrigation schemes are carried out to completion.

AB Growing inorganic and expansive hydrochemical datasets and large differences in the measured concentrations require methods that are capable of compressing data without the loss of critical information and subsequently displaying it in a condensed and comprehensive way. Here we train an artificial neural network, Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM), to model inorganic hydrochemical clusters and associate the salinity source with the distribution of the ionic concentration spatial variation at a former potash mining site. Kohonen's self-organizing maps are applied to project the data onto a two-dimensional grid and the geometric relationship of the projected vectors is subsequently used to perform a hierarchical cluster analysis. The SOM clustering approach succeeded in assigning the groundwater samples automatically according to their inorganic chemical composition. Five different clusters, three geogenic and two anthropogenic, were identified. The final outcome is displayed and compared with the classification from Piper plotting of the same dataset. In order to see the SOM clustering results in the large scale hydrogeological context, the distribution of the clusters is displayed spatially. This approach is a tool for the hydrogeologist to quickly analyze large datasets and present them in a clear and concise format.

AB The dynamics of transients of fluid-rock temperature, pore pressure, pollutants in porous rocks are of vivid interest for fundamental problems in hydrological, volcanic, hydrocarbon systems, deep oil drilling. This can concern rapid landslides or the fault weakening during coseismic slips and also a new field of research about stability of classical buildings. Here we analyze the transient evolution of temperature and pressure in a thin boundary layer between two adjacent homogeneous media for various types of rocks. In previous models, this boundary was often assumed to be a sharp mathematical plane. Here we consider a non-sharp, physical boundary between two adjacent rocks, where also local steady pore pressure and/or temperature fields are present. To obtain a more reliable model we also investigate the role of nonlinear effects as convection and fluid-rock "frictions", often disregarded in early models: these nonlinear effects in some cases can give remarkable quick and sharp transients. All of this implies a novel model, whose solutions describe large, sharp and quick fronts. We also rapidly describe transients moving through a particularly irregular boundary layer.

AB The saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) is considered to be one of the main soil hydraulic properties to simulate water transport in the vadose zone, yet it is notoriously difficult to assess due to its large field-scale variability and sensitivity to preferential flow paths. With the increasing availability of convenient methods to measure the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K-u), the additional value of measuring K-s could be questioned. This study investigates the relevance of measuring K-s in two ways. Firstly, a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate which part of the hydraulic conductivity curve impacts the simulation of unsaturated water transport most. It was found that hydraulic conductivity curve between -10 cm and -1000 cm matric head was affecting the simulation more than at saturation. Secondly, a functional evaluation was performed by simulating water flow in six test fields according to three scenarios, in which the hydraulic properties were determined with the measured K-s and/or K-u. The simulation of saturation degree at three depths was the least accurate in the scenario where only K-s was measured. Remarkably, the most accurate simulation was found in the scenario with only the measured K-u. According to these results, measuring K-u would be of greater importance than measuring K-s for the simulation of water flow in the vadose zone.

AB Losing eight meters of water level over a 20-year period from 1996 to 2016 marked the Lake Urmia (LU) as one of the regional environmental crises. This condition has threatened biota life, intensified desertification around the lake, and raised social concerns by adversely impacting the inhabitants' health and economy. In 2013, the Urmia Lake Restoration National Committee (ULRNC) started implementing certain management practices to stop the drying trend of LU, resulted in the cease of water level drop and stabilization of LU condition in 2016. Nevertheless, the restoration actions have not yet raised the lake to the water level as planned by the roadmap. This paper aims to describe and to assess the LU restoration plans by underscoring the ULRNC achievements, challenges, and shortcomings. In particular, we discuss how the value of data and data-aided modeling has been underestimated by the LU restoration programs, leading to still existing puzzles about the lake interaction with the involving physical processes governing its dynamics. We show how the LU restoration timetable has not fulfilled the planned milestones as evidenced by the inability to capture the anticipated lake water levels, which is partly attributed to the lack of field data and dynamic modeling that could predict the lake response in a more reliable and conservative manner. The current restoration plans should also be revisited to ensure that any practice with the aim of reducing water consumption in the basin is not only environmentally sustainable but also feasible from the socioeconomic perspective. The insights provided by this paper attempt to underscore the value of field data collection for establishing a reliable conceptual model, and for executing pre- and post-monitoring of the lake so that the success or failure of the restoration actions taken by the policymakers can be appropriately evaluated.

AB High urbanization puts many groundwater resources at risk of quality deterioration. Analyzing all viable potential groundwater contamination scenarios for good decision making requires reliable tool. Coupling several complex models in integrated modelling can often fail to perform in reasonable time. Possible solution in that case could be usage of simplified models in order to speed up long-term continuous calculations and simulations. The paper presents the application of the Cellular Automata (CA) approach in modelling of the contaminant transport under unsteady groundwater conditions. It compares the results obtained using coupled CA models with well-known analytical solutions and standard methods used for pollution transport modelling in groundwater conditions, such as coupled MODFLOW and MT3DMS. Results obtained in this paper show that CA approach can be satisfactorily used for simulations of unsteady groundwater conditions, caused by surface-groundwater interaction, and pollution transport, especially in diffusion dominant cases, gaining the reduction of simulation time up to 10 times.

AB Where surface and groundwater are managed conjunctively, the stress on water supplies from climate change can significantly influence water use patterns as well as the economic value and sustainability of those uses. However, aquifer protection can be an expensive proposition because water uses that currently rely on aquifer pumping may produce considerable economic value that would be lost if protection measures are carried out. Evidence from climate-stressed regions has attracted research addressing the costs and benefits of aquifer protection plans. Despite these efforts, few peer-reviewed papers have examined water use patterns that minimize the economic costs of aquifer protection. This work presents an original approach to address that gap by developing and applying a basin scale hydroeconomic optimization model of North America's Middle Rio Grande Basin to explore impacts of new policies not yet implemented supporting aquifer protection. It also gives model access to readers or stakeholders to experiment with their own scenarios to assess impacts of alternative aquifer protection plans. The model accounts for surface and groundwater storage, irrigation, urban, environmental, and recreational demands, surface water inflows under various climate scenarios, groundwater pumping and recharge, substitute water prices, crop water use, evaporation, as well as institutional constraints governing water use. The objective is implemented by finding the optimized discounted net present value of economic benefits summed over uses, sectors, and regions from use of surface water and connected aquifers. Results are shown for each of six water supply scenarios, two substitute water prices, and two system operation rules. To address impacts of aquifer protection targets, groundwater sustainability targets are specified and enforced as constraints for each of the region's two major aquifers. We assess total and marginal cost of achieving two targeted aquifer protection levels by identifying optimized surface use and groundwater pumping for each of 24 scenarios. Results show that climate change, in the form of reduced and highly variable inflows, considerably drives up the cost of protecting aquifer sustainability, amplified by the conjunctive nature of the system. Future work points to a need to assess economic performance of various water conservation measures as well as reducing costs of substitute water through measures such as technical advance in desalination, recycling and reuse, substitution of other resources for water, better characterization of existing aquifers, and development of new groundwater supplies.

AB Groundwater resources are increasingly exploited for industrial and agricultural purposes in many arid/semiarid regions globally. In order to gain a harmonious development among groundwater resources and economic benefits, urgent investigation of the impacts of anthropogenic activities on the groundwater chemistry is required. Understanding hydrochemical mechanism of groundwater in Yinchuan Plain, arid and semi-arid area in Northwestern China, plays a significant role in water resources planning in this ecologically sensitive area. In this paper, a total of 460 phreatic water samples were collected, including 58 water samples containing isotopic data (D and H-2). Results demonstrate that water chemistry type and isotopic data of phreatic water presents a zonation characteristic from west to east and from south to north. In the eastern part of the Helan Mountain (A(1) zone), the type of hydrochemistry is mainly HCO3 center dot SO4-CaMg, SO4 center dot HCO3-Ca center dot Mg, which is mainly recharged by the bedrock fissure water of Helan Mountain. However, in the southern Qingtongxia (A(2) zone) are HCO3-Na HCO3-Ca center dot Mg, which receives irrigation and spring water recharge. Phreatic aquifer in Multi-layered structure zone (A(3) zone) reflect multiple recharge sources to the aquifer, the water chemistry demonstrates diverse variations. The anion was dominated by the HCO3, while the cation is dominated by sodium. The predominant controlling factors of phreatic water hydrochemistry are divided into anthropogenic activities and natural conditions. Natural conditions mainly include the existence form and lithology of the aquifer, sources of groundwater recharge, soil salinity, and evaporation, mineral dissolution, ion exchange and adsorption and mixing effect. Meanwhile, among natural factors, minerals dissolution in groundwater is the main process dominating the hydrochemical evolution of the groundwater. The other is anthropogenic activities which can be classified as groundwater pollution, excessive exploitation or excretion of groundwater, and excessive groundwater recharge.

AB Accurate influent flow forecasting plays a significant role in management, operation, scheduling and utilization of the sewage treatment plants. In design and operate such plants, it is essential to measure and forecast the influent flow rate in wastewater plants. In this paper, the Very immediate-short-term to long-term influent flow rate are modeled and forecasted by a new developed hybrid model of ANFIS and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). The objective of this study is the integration of GWO with ANFIS in forecasting multi-ahead influent flow rate. The forecast horizon of the model is from 5 min up to 10 days bases on Gamma Test (GT) feature selection of input combinations. As the parameters of ANFIS have effect on the forecasting accuracy, these parameters are adjusted and optimized by using Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). Then the choice of appropriate input parameters at different prediction horizons from Very immediate-short-term (5-min ahead) to long-term (10 days ahead) was discussed for influent forecasting. The statistical indices of RMSE, NSE, MAE, RAE, R-2, d, CI and graphical evaluations such as scatter-plots with confidence bounds, error distributions, Taylor diagrams, box-plots and empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) were implemented for assessing the performance of all models in prediction horizons. Furthermore as another novelty in the present paper, recursive forecasting models based on previous forecasted values is used to improve the accuracy and applicability of ANFIS-GWO in recursive predictions. Our Results showed that: (1) the hybrid of ANFIS-GWO significantly improved the prediction accuracy. (2) ANFIS-GWO performs more efficiently than the ANFIS in almost all of the prediction horizons (ANFIS-GWO1: 5 min ahead; ANFIS-GWO11: 1-2 days ahead; ANFIS-GWO8: one week ahead). (3) The performance of models in influent flow forecasting is significantly influenced by the prediction horizon. The computational results confirmed that the ANFIS-GWO performs well in all of prediction horizons. Equally the true values and the trends are precisely forecasted by the ANFIS-GWO. Results of this novel study demonstrate that reliable estimates of influent flow rate from 5-min up to 10 days in advance can be achieved using the developed direct and recursive hybrid GWO models.

AB Catchment classification aids in the identification of homogeneous regions in which catchments have similar flood timing and corresponding climatic drivers. As a new classification scheme from complex network theory, the community detection method is introduced to classify 242 catchments in the United States based on flood seasonality. The robustness of this method is tested by calculating the Adjusted Rank Index between the classification results from different random subsets of the 242 catchments and different flood sampling methods. In addition, three network metrics (network density, centrality, and k-core nucleus) are used to further unravel the hydrological connections within each community of catchments. Catchments with similar flood seasonality cluster into six large communities, while catchments in sparsely gauged areas or with unique physiographic properties are isolated from large communities. High values of the Adjusted Rank Index show the robustness of the community detection method for catchment classification. The results indicate that the complex network is valid for use in classifying catchments based on flood seasonality. Moreover, for each community, the network metrics are potential descriptors of: (a) the degree of homogeneity, (b) the representativeness of any catchment, and (c) the spatial scale of synchronized floods. Therefore, the complex network is able to characterize the interconnections between catchments within the community.

AB This study proposes a novel socio-hydrological modeling framework for assessing the performance of complex water resources systems. It employs and integrates agent-based modeling (ABM) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB) into the socio-hydrological modeling framework to account for agents' behaviors. Due to farmers' major role in anthropogenic droughts, this paper mainly focuses on farmers' behavior. The TPB framework and the agents' behavioral rules in ABM are structured based on the data obtained from field questionnaires and interviews by the farmers in the Zarrineh River Basin as the main river feeding the Urmia Lake. The proposed modeling framework, including the TPB and ABM structures and rules, are validated by comparing the results of the proposed socio-hydrological simulation model with the actual data on the simulation period. To assess the ability of the proposed framework, root mean square error (RMSE) and the determination coefficient (DC) were computed. The results show the acceptable performance of the proposed model by RMSE = 0.18 and DC = 0.92. Analysis of the results indicates that financial conditions, farmland size, farmers' age, and farmers' education are among the major factors in farmers' decision-making process, respectively.

AB River discharges flood forecasting is a complex task with multiple sources of uncertainty. Bayesian methods can incorporate multiple types of uncertainties by inferring the probability density function of ensemble forecasts based on past events. However, such methods lead to forecasts with large uncertainty bands. In order to reduce the uncertainty in the forecasts, we focus solely on the prediction of the upper and lower range of the uncertainty bands. Therefore, we develop three forecast methods in which we search for the indexes of the upper and lower forecast members of an ensemble (termed best-pairs), which provide the highest predictive skill. The results show for four distinct hindcasts of historical events in a case study in Bavaria (Germany) that the new methods have a higher predictive skill of the observations than probabilistic methods, at least for the first 4 out of 12 h' forecasts. Moreover, the new methods are computational efficient because they considerably reduce the number of members of the ensembles required to produce a flood discharge forecast with high predictive skill.

AB Subsurface reservoirs are far more heterogeneous and complex than the simulation models in terms of scale, assumptions and description. In this work, we address the issue of prediction reliability while calibrating imperfect/low-fidelity reservoir models. The main goal is to avoid over-confident and inaccurate predictions by including a model for the bias terms (i.e. error-model of a predefined form) during the history matching process. Our aim is to obtain unbiased posterior distributions of the physical model parameters and thus improving the prediction capacity of the calibrated low-fidelity reservoir models. We formulate the parameter estimation problem as a joint estimation of the imperfect model parameters and the error-model parameters. The structure of the error-model and the prior distributions of the error-model parameters are evaluated before calibration through analysis of leading sources of the modeling errors. We adopt a Bayesian framework for solving the inverse problem, where we utilize the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation (ES-MDA) as a practical history matching algorithm.
   We provide two test cases, where the impact of typical model errors originating from grid coarsening/upscaling and from utilizing an imperfect geological model description is investigated. For both cases results from the ES-MDA update with and without accounting for model error are compared in terms of estimated physical model parameters, quality of match to historical data and forecasting ability compared to held out data. The test results show that calibration of the imperfect physical model without accounting for model errors results in extreme values of the calibrated model parameters and a biased posterior distribution. With accounting for modeling errors the posterior distribution of the model parameters is less biased (i.e. nearly unbiased) and improved forecasting skills with higher prediction accuracy/reliability is observed. Moreover, the consistency between the different runs of the ES-MDA is improved by including the modeling error component. Although the examples in the paper consider the oil-water system with permeabilities being parameters of the physical model, the developed methodology is general and can be applied to typical ground water hydrology models.

AB The impact of crucial geographic and climatic factors on the input source errors of integrated multi-satellite precipitation estimates is an important but still unclear issue for both algorithm developers and data users. This study primarily focused on the impacts of the twelve input sources used in the latest Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM-GSMaP) for different climatic regions, elevations, and seasons over mainland China. Our evaluation results show that the error features of the input sources from several passive microwave and infrared sensors are related to the accuracy of GPM-GSMaP precipitation estimates. The input sources show larger hits, misses and false biases in the semi-arid and arid regions, for which the false bias was particularly significant. As for the seasonality, the input data sources exhibit a better performance in summer and have relatively lower hits and higher biases in winter. We also found that precipitation retrievals of the input sources are affected by topography in different extents. In terms of passive microwave sensors, the conical-scanning imagers generally outperform the cross-track-scanning sounders, but the sounders-based precipitation estimates have relatively better detection capability. As one of the core sensors for GPM, the microwave imager GMI reveals inadequacies in representing areal rainfall patterns and has relatively large biases especially in the winter and spring seasons, suggesting that the current GMI algorithm might need to be further improved.

AB The determination of area-averaged evapotranspiration (ET) over a heterogeneous land surface at the satellite pixel scale/model grid scale (10(3)-10(4) m) is crucial to the evaluation of the remote sensing ET products and development of the parameterization schemes of general hydro-meteorological models. The Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) flux matrix of multi-site eddy-covariance (EC) and large aperture scintillometers (LASs) provided an unprecedented opportunity to establish an aggregation scheme for determining area-averaged surface fluxes. Based on the HiWATER flux matrix datasets and high-resolution land-cover map, a new flux aggregation method was developed by using footprint analysis and multiple-linear regression. The area-averaged sensible heat fluxes aggregated from the multi-site EC flux measurements using the developed method were compared with the LAS measured fluxes. The results showed that the new method produced reasonable estimates of sensible heat flux with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) value of around 20-30%. The new aggregation method also significantly outperformed other methods being applied commonly, such as the rather simple area-weighted method. The daily ET of various land-cover types and the area-averaged ET over the key area of the Populus euphratica forest reserve in the Ejina Oasis were separately estimated using the established disaggregation and aggregation schemes of the new method. The area-averaged ET over this key area ranged between 1 and 5 mm d(-1) for the 68 days growing period in 2014. Results of this study can be used for the evaluation of relevant remote sensing models and land surface process models.

AB An autonomous, low cost (< US$750), and open source rainfall sampler has been developed for hydrogen and oxygen isotope research, able to sample daily and monthly for up to 60 days of rainfall, over a three month period. The sampler is designed to use modern fabrication methods such as 3D printing and laser cutting to minimise the need for machined and injection molded components. The sampler can use either paraffin oil or a submerged inlet tube (also known as tube-dip-in samplers) to prevent evaporation, with the use of the inlet tube method facilitated by 3D printed bottle caps. An experiment was performed to identify the most suitable plastic for these caps, with acetone treated ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) being most suitable, followed by PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol), untreated ABS, and PLA (Polylactic acid). In addition, the effectiveness of both paraffin oil and the inlet tube method for preventing evaporation was quantified, with paraffin identified as being the most effective at present. During a 90 day outdoor experiment, the O-18/O-16 vs. H-2/H-1 ratios of some water samples evolved along a local evaporation line, with increased isotopic enrichment of samples correlating to water loss. A coupled hydrologic-isotopic model was applied to these data, and successfully predicted the change in isotope ratios based on the amount of water lost from each sample. This modelling approach, combined with daily and monthly sample collection and quantification of evaporation rates within the sheltered environment of the sampler allows for back calculation of the original volume and isotopic composition of daily and monthly rainfall samples. The rainfall sampler thus facilitates cost -and time- effective remote monitoring of the isotopic composition of precipitation to support an array of Earth system research.

AB The soil carbon (C) reservoir involves soil organic and inorganic carbon stocks. The influence of soil erosion processes on soil organic carbon (SOC) migration has been investigated in the literature, but the influence on soil inorganic carbon (SIC) remains uncertain. Variations in the proportion of SOC and SIC in eroded sediment can influence C cycling, so we conducted a detailed laboratory study to investigate the selective transport of SOC and SIC in eroded sediment in treatments with different raindrop sizes and inflow rates. We used the boosted regression trees (BRT) models to estimate the SOC and SIC contents according to the ratio of flow depth and raindrop diameter (h/D), the maximum shear stress (tau*(max)), the runoff rate, the stream power (omega), the sediment concentration (SC), the soil loss rate (SLR), and various particle-related factors, including D50, D[4,3], D[3,2], clay content, silt content and sand content of non-dispersed sediment. The BRT model explained 42.1% and 56.1% of the variation in the SOC and SIC contents in the sediment, respectively. The relative importance of particle-related factors was approximately 50%, demonstrating that the particle size distribution (PSD) of sediment was a crucial factor for both SOC and SIC transport. The SOC content was sensitive to the presence of fine particles, while the SIC content was largely determined by coarse particles because smaller particles with a higher specific surface area tended to adsorb more SOC whereas coarser particles contained more carbonates in the form of binding agents. In sediment under intensive rainfall on steep slopes, the SOC tended to be depleted, while the SIC was slightly enriched. Our study demonstrates that both SIC and SOC were selectively transported by water erosion and fills gaps in this field of research. Moreover, this work implies that the PSD of the sediment provides important information about the variation in SOC and SIC and should be considered when modelling the global C cycle.

AB Physically-based numerical modelling of surface processes in urban drainage, such as pollutant wash-off or the assessment of flood risks, requires appropriate calibration and terrain elevation data to properly simulate the overland flows and thus to achieve useful results. Accordingly, this study aims to obtain an accurate representation of the runoff generated by three different rain intensities, 30, 50 and 80 mm/h, in a full-scale urban drainage physical model of 36 m(2). The study focuses firstly on applying the Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetric technique to carry out a high-resolution and accurate topographic survey. This topography was implemented in a 2D shallow water model and the results were compared with those obtained using traditional data point measured topography. Negligible differences were found when comparing the two models with measured discharges at the physical model gully pots. However, significant differences were obtained in the velocity distributions, especially in the shallowest flow areas where drainage channels of a few millimeters' depth appeared in the high resolution topographic survey. Results from the numerical model were compared with overland flow velocities, determined by applying a modified Large Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV) methodology using fluorescent particles. With the SfM topography, the 2D model was able to obtain a better representation of the experimental data, since small scale irregularities of the pavement surface could be represented in the model domain. At the same time, LSPIV was presented as a very suitable tool for the accurate measurement of runoff velocities in urban drainage models, avoiding the interference of raindrop features in the recorded images and with overland water depths in the order of few millimeters.

AB Structural, parametric and measurement uncertainties are inherent in watershed hydrology models. Among these, structural uncertainty results from simplified representation of reality in models and has proven to be particularly challenging to characterize. Often, flow measurements are available at the outlet or a few other locations within a watershed, and distributed model parameters are calibrated to replicate observed streamflow values. Subsequently, one can quantify uncertainty in streamflow estimation at the measured locations. The objective of this study is the quantification of structural and parametric uncertainty at unmeasured locations using a calibrated watershed hydrologic model. While propagation of parametric uncertainty to unmeasured locations is a relatively simple task in a Bayesian framework, this study is focused on the problem of structural uncertainty propagation. We propose to treat the hydrologic model as a stochastic function by treating the parameters of the model as random quantities, even in the limit of infinite information through data, thus enabling us to accommodate the uncertainty due to structural errors. A mathematical formulation of the method and applications over two different watersheds, using hourly and daily flow data, are presented. The structural uncertainty band at ungauged locations enveloped all the streamflow observations at daily-scale and missed most of the observations at hourly-scale. Structural uncertainty varies spatially at unmeasured locations within the watershed. Consequently, streamflows estimated at unmeasured locations may be accompanied by wide uncertainty bands implying the need for caution when using them.

AB Spatial and temporal distributions of soil moisture are important for explaining hydrological processes at the hillslope scale. The fate of various hillslope flow paths can vary seasonally and their relationship with rainfall events can be nonstationary. We collected high resolution in situ soil moisture datasets at 30 points (10 locations in three depths) between March and November in a steep mountainous hillslope. The wavelet coherence analysis of eco-hydrometeorological factors and soil moistures indicated distinctive controls of rainfall and evapotranspiration over soil moisture at time scales of under a day. The vertical flow in upslope areas can be explained by significant wavelet coherence in soil moisture profiles. The appearance of lateral flow with vertical flow in the downslope is associated with even more significant wavelet coherence between identical depths. The wavelet coherence analysis between two soil moisture time series both along hillslope layers and depth profiles provided good spatial and temporal representations of hillslope hydrological processes in terms of their timing and scale. The distributions of soil moisture coherences showed distinctive characteristics for three different seasons. The seasonally distinctive role of vegetation to infiltration was apparent for the upslope area, but the combined impact of vegetation and topography controlled more complicated hydrological processes in the downslope area. The phase angle analysis was introduced to show the profile difference of hydrological processes on various time scales.

AB Dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) have led to widely distributed groundwater contamination due to their widespread applications and accidental spills. To investigate influences of two factor-ionic strength and permeability on the representative elementary volume (REV) of DNAPL, four experiments are conducted in two-dimensional (2D) porous media to investigate perchloroethylene (PCE) migration and associated REVs. The permeability and ionic strength of four experiments are set as different schemes. PCE migration and REVs are estimated by moment analysis and the criteria of the relative gradient error (epsilon(i)(g)). Results suggest that the permeability and ionic strength are of significant effects on REVs of PCE. Higher permeability of porous media can promote the vertical infiltrate rate of PCE in aquifer. Simultaneously, higher ionic strength can lower the second moments of PCE plume and increase the GTP of PCE mass. More importantly, higher permeability has increased the REV of PCE saturation (S-o) with absolute errors of 1.35 mm and 2.71 mm under conditions of low and high ionic strength. Besides, higher permeability has decreased the REV of PCE-water interfacial area (A(ow)) with absolute errors of 2.76 mm and 1.09 mm under conditions of low and high ionic strength. What's more, ionic strength has no apparent effects on S-o-REV sizes when permeability is high (absolute error equals to 0.16 mm between low and high ionic strength). However, high ionic strength can decrease the minimum REV sizes of S-o when permeability is low (absolute error is 1.52 mm). Moreover, high ionic strength can increase minimum REV sizes of Aow with absolute errors of 1.49 mm and 1.01 mm under conditions of high and low permeability. These findings can improve the understanding of DNAPLs behaviors in subsurface environment under complex condition.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article
DE Saline basin; Evaporite; Calcium carbonate; Water retention; Salinity
ID EVOLUTION
AB An evaporitic environment is characterized by having high salinity, climatic, and hydrological factors that promote a negative water balance; however, biological factors may also influence their development. Modern coastal flat Paso Seco (40 degrees 33'S; 62 degrees 14'W) is located in a semi-arid region with low precipitation and dry winds coming mainly from the NW. The site is an old tidal channel, which nowadays behaves like a shallow coastal saline-like basin, separated from the sea by a sand barrier, which the sea periodically overcomes, flooding the flat with eventual water evaporation. Microbial mats of up to 1 cm thick colonize the sandy sediments of this evaporitic environment. Water samples were taken during five field trips (2017-2018) from interstitial water of the flat, a tidal creek that crosses the flat, and two shallow tidal depressions (TDs) within the flat with different degrees of evaporation. In comparison to the sea, the maximum salinity values measured in Austral spring (September 2017) in the tidal creek were doubled, tripled in interstitial water, and 5.9 to 8 times higher in TDs. Ionic concentration denotes that evaporite chemical divides are followed as water evaporates, corresponding to the presence of CaCO3, gypsum and halite found in TDs. On-site permeability of microbial mat-covered surfaces presented semi-pervious properties. Microbial mat presence is condition for CaCO3, gypsum, and halite precipitation as they allow for water retention and its consequent evaporation due to the impermeability they confer to the sedimentary surface, Thus, microbial mats are a biological factor affecting the development of an evaporitic environment.

AB A new stage discharge relationship is suggested for wide meandering streams (ratio of floodplain width and that of main channel in excess of 5.5 and up to 30) with overbank flow. The boundary shear data obtained from various data series with specified range of width ratio and channel sinuosity are analysed. By regression technique, new empirical relationships are derived between the channel dimensions and amount of shear generated for different flow conditions. These new boundary shear models are then used to obtain the stage discharge relation in channels with given roughness characteristics. The present method is then validated for its usefulness by applying the same to a number of data series of small scale and large scale flume experiments of other research projects from the literature. The errors (%) in discharge estimation are within limits for such methods as per practice (i.e. around +/- 10% for both smooth and rough meandering channels). The method is also compared with a number of other methods from the literature by application to different data series. The RMSE (root mean squared error) value for all the data series validated is estimated as 9.6% and the method is found to be ranked third among all the methods. The method is also able to predict satisfactorily the flow distribution in case of a number of homogeneously smooth and non homogeneously roughened meandering channels of varying sinuosity with overbank flow for large scale flume experimental data sets. The mean error for three available data series is estimated as - 3.4% while the RMSE error is 10.68%. Due to its ease of application and simple approach, this 1D method may serve as a preliminary design tool for assessing stage discharge curve for wide two stage channels in field conditions for application in flood estimation and flood warning cum relief measures. Such a preliminary study might better decide the need for further refinement through any exhaustive deep study; the more robust and expensive 2D or 3D analysis.

AB This study investigated the potential of assessing the water balance in South America, at multiple scales, using satellite remote sensing precipitation and evapotranspiration datasets, terrestrial water storage changes from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), and discharge measurements. The remote sensing precipitation datasets included those of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), whilst the ET constituents included the MODIS Global Evapotranspiration Project (MOD16) and the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM). Uncertainties in precipitation and ET were evaluated using in situ measurements of 307 rain-gauge stations and 16 eddy covariance sites, respectively. The water balance closure and uncertainties were evaluated in 50 basins for the period 2003-2014, at different spatial scales and under different climatic conditions. Overall, MSWEP precipitation and GLEAM ET provided fewer uncertainties, whilst TRMM and MOD16 yielded greater bias and more errors. Better agreements between the TWSC from GRACE and the water balance were found in the large and medium-sized basins, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of about 42%, whilst small basins and those located in regions with subtropical humid climates, where precipitation did not present strong seasonality, had a RMSE around 130%, indicating that climate conditions can influence the water balance closure. The TWSC from GRACE and the remote sensing water balance estimations were in agreement for more than half of the evaluated basins, mainly those located in tropical climate regions. Greater bias and more errors were found in the estimations of discharge in the semi-arid basins, with low runoff coefficients. Despite the water balance based on remote sensing estimations remaining a challenge due to the large uncertainties in precipitation, ET, and TWSC, our results showed their great potential for assessing terrestrial water-cycle dynamics and understanding their spatial and temporal variability at multiple scales.

AB The development of water quality prediction models is an important step towards better water quality management of rivers. The traditional method for computing WQI is always associated with errors due to the protracted analysis of the water quality parameters in addition to the great effort and time involved in gathering and analyzing water samples. In addition, the cost of identifying the magnitude of some of the parameters through experimental testing is very high. The water quality of rivers in Malaysia is ranked into five classes based on water quality index (WQI). WQI is function of six water quality parameters: ammoniac nitrogen (NH3-N), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and suspended solids (SS). In this research, the decision tree machine learning technique is used to predict the WQI for the Kiang River and its classification within a specific water quality class. Kiang River is one of the most polluted rivers in Malaysia. Modeling experiments are designed to test the prediction and classification accuracy of the model based on various scenarios composed of different water quality parameters. Results show that the proposed prediction model has a promising potential to predict the class of the WQI. Moreover, the proposed model offers a more efficient process and cost-effective approach for the computation and prediction of WQI.

AB Eklutna Lake is the primary water supply for Anchorage, Alaska; therefore the hydrogeologic properties of Eklutna surficial deposits are important to characterize. However, there is limited data on the hydraulic conductivity of surficial deposits in the Eklutna basin. This study presents hydraulic conductivity (K-fs and K-sat) measurements using two methods: the bottomless bucket and particle size distribution methods. Statistically, the two methods produced similar results; however, the large range in values obtained for K-fs and K-sat suggests there is a great degree of natural variation. One method used a bottomless bucket in place of a ring infiltrometer to measure field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-fs). The other method used a sieve-derived particle size distribution to solve a modified Hazen equation for K-sat. Of 47 samples collected in nine surficial geologic units, from poorly-sorted to well-sorted soils, the means of the two datasets were statistically similar: 49 m/day (K-fs) vs. 41 m/day (K-sat). Although the variability between the datasets was significantly different, with a standard deviation ranging from 44 m/day (K-fs) to 75 m/day (K-sat), the Wilcoxon paired-samples and paired t-test results suggest the datasets are statistically similar. Additionally, 98% of the 47 paired values were within one order of magnitude of each other. The methods presented herein can be used for surficial geologic unit delineation, planning purposes and optimizing hydrological models.

AB Hydrological connections between aquifers and boreal mires need to be better understood for protection of this type of wetland. Three-dimensional (3D) models have so far been sparsely used for such systems. This study investigated the effect of parameterisation with global sensitivity analysis on groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) interactions in a boreal esker-aapa mire system. Sensitivity analysis by the elementary effect (Morris) method was applied to a 3D steady-state hydrological model built with the fully-integrated HydroGeoSphere code. Parameter sensitivity with respect to various model outputs was explored, providing comprehensive insights into the most hydrologically relevant parameters. The results indicated that depending on model outputs the most influential model parameters varied. They also revealed existence of feedback in terms of interdependence of parameters between the esker aquifer and surrounding aapa mires. The properties of the mire (or peatland) landscape affected groundwater levels in the unconfined aquifer and, conversely, esker-mire interactions depended on esker hydraulic characteristics. This implies that accurate representation of both systems is required and that reliable determination of GW-SW interactions may be impeded by parameter interactions. In this study, the van Genuchten functions were used to represent hydraulic properties of unsaturated flow domain and the results revealed that formal sensitivity analysis methods based on random sampling might not be appropriate for evaluating parametric sensitivity. If the van Genuchten parameters ranges are large, randomly sampled values may not always produce physically realistic water retention characteristics. Overall, our results demonstrate that the computationally efficient elementary effect method is a suitable tool for investigating the parametric sensitivity of integrated models, enhancing modelling of boreal groundwater-dependent ecosystems.

AB Recent annual trends of precipitation and terrestrial water storage (TWS) in West Africa have been increasing over the past decade. Despite a significant impact of soil moisture on the TWS in West Africa, there is little research on the recent spatial and temporal behaviors of surface soil moisture (SSM) along with the hydrological trends and variability in West Africa. In this study, we assimilate TWS estimates from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission into the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) and evaluate its impacts on SSM simulations for the years, 2002-2017. The evaluation is performed using reference datasets: the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) in situ soil moisture observations, three currently available microwave satellite SSM observations from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS), and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites and also the triple collocation analysis (TCA). Overall, modeled SSM shows good agreement with the reference datasets in terms of the anomaly SSM correlations. However, both modeled and ASCAT SSM are limited in their representation of the drying rates, as observed by ground observations, SMOS and SMAP estimates. Further, GRACE data assimilation results in improved SSM simulations in the humid regions with large annual TWS variability. This study demonstrates the utility of land data assimilation to inform hydrological conditions in West Africa, where soil moisture monitoring is necessary for water resource and livestock management.

ID PRECIPITATION; RIVERS
AB Trend analysis is continuously in the research and application agenda due to climate change effect searches on various engineering, social, economic, agriculture, environmental and water resources design, management, operation and management studies. Classical trend analysis is useable for holistic trend identification and then statistical quantification as for its intercept and slope. The main drawbacks in these classical approaches are the set of fundamental assumptions such as the serial independence of the given time series, pre-whitening, normality of the data and non-existence of serial comparison among different sections of the same record. This paper explains a non-parametric approach to avoid almost all these difficulties by simple methodology, which is referred as the Innovative Polygonal Trend Analysis (IPTA). Such an approach helps not only to identify the trend in a given series, but also trend transitions between successive sections of the two equal segments from the original hydro-meteorological time series leading to trend polygon, which provides a productive basis for finer interpretation with linguistic and numerical interpretations and inferences from a given time series. The application of the IPTA is presented for rainfall records from New Jersey, USA, Danube River and Goksu River discharge records from Romania and Turkey.

AB Soil hydraulic conductivity (K) significantly affects subsurface flow and solute transport, but convenient measurement of K remains a challenge. Electrical conductivity (EC), which can be measured conveniently and accurately, can be quantitatively related to K because of the similarity between current movement and groundwater flow, motivating us to estimate K using EC. A soil column apparatus was built to explore the relation between EC and K. Fifty-four experiments were conducted under various degrees of soil compaction and grain diameters, including six different particle sizes, three compaction levels, and six solution concentrations. The overall (negative) correlation between K and EC can be fitted reasonably well by an exponential function with a large determination coefficient (> 0.81) for each solute concentration, while a power-law function better fits the correlation when K is larger than 10 m/d. These experiments led to several empirical models (for specific solution concentrations) and one comprehensive model (with variable parameters) to estimate K given EC. In the field, if the EC of pore water can be measured, the empirical models under the specific solution concentrations can be applied to greatly improve the K estimation. Comparison showed that the proposed models, which provides a quick estimate of K using easily available EC, performed better than most of the classical grain size-based formulas. Although there is uncertainty in the K estimation likely due to the limited control factors considered in this study, the new method proposed above can provide a convenient estimate for K for the field site with strong spatial heterogeneity.

AB Suction in subgrade layer reaches an equilibrium condition several years after construction of the pavement. The equilibrium suction has a direct influence on the resilient modulus of subgrade soil. In the current mechanistic-empirical pavement design guide, equilibrium suction is determined based on the empirical relationship with water table depth. However studies have shown that other critical factors also influence equilibrium suction. In this study, a new mechanistic-empirical model is presented to predict equilibrium suction considering the effects of physical properties of the soil and climatic factors. A simple regression model is also generated to predict the equilibrium suction from readily available parameters i.e., Thornthwaite moisture index (TMI), plasticity index (P1), and dry suction value at surface (u(dry)). In the final section of this paper, the effects of TMI and vegetation on equilibrium suction are evaluated for various soil classes and TMI ranges, respectively. A contour map of the equilibrium suction values for the entire continental United States has been generated using the geographic information system (GIS) platform and followed by the model predictions.

AB Due to shallow groundwater tables and easy water availability, many people live in coastal areas. Additionally, alluvial sediments from fluviatile and marine deposits are highly suitable for agricultural use, making coastal settlement even more desirable. However, groundwater nitrate pollution resulting from widespread application of fertilizers creates difficulties for water management officials. Cut-off walls are used to control seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers. However, until now, the effect of cut-off walls on the nitrate contamination of groundwater has been largely unknown. In this paper, the first investigation of the influence of a subsurface cut-off wall on nitrate contamination in groundwater is discussed. Two sets of laboratory experiments - one with and one without a subsurface cut-off wall - were performed to validate the effectiveness of the constructed numerical model. The effects of the subsurface cut-off wall height, distance between the subsurface cut-off wall and the saltwater boundary, and infiltration rates on nitrate distribution and contamination in groundwater were analyzed. Results showed that after the construction of the subsurface cut-off wall, the domain mean velocity decreased, the migration of nitrate pollutants to the saltwater boundary was reduced, and the nitrate-contaminated area expanded. Further, the morphology of the nitrate pollution plumes changed, an indentation appeared directly above the subsurface cut-off wall, the widths of the transition zones increased significantly, and the transition zones became more diffuse as one approached the saltwater wedge. Three indices were developed to quantify the degree of nitrate contamination. The relative height of the subsurface cut-off wall (H') and the nitrate infiltration rate (Ni) were the two most significant factors determining the degree of nitrate contamination in groundwater near the subsurface cut-off wall. Therefore, we suggest that subsurface cut-off walls be designed such that their height lies below an experimentally determined critical height; thus reducing the infiltration rate of the contaminants produced during fertilization through water-saving irrigation techniques.

AB Assessment of large-scale temperature dynamics and heat fluxes in shallow lakes requires comprehensive modeling capabilities to simulate water interactions, the processes related to the heat budget, and their driving forces. In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal variations in water-surface temperature (WST) and surface heat fluxes for the period between January 2001 and December 2010 in Lake Mirim, a large (surface area ca. 4000 km(2)) shallow lake on the Brazil-Uruguay border. The aquatic ecosystem was examined using in-situ WST measurements, MODIS land surface temperature (M*D11A1 LST) products, and a coupling between a large-scale hydrologic model (MGB-IPH) and a hydrodynamic/water quality model (IPH-ECO). The WST values estimated by the hydrodynamic model were consistent with measured in-situ data and MODIS-derived WST, using both daytime and nighttime time series (R-2 = 0.88; Bias = 1.45 degrees C; RMSE = 2.16 degrees C; ENS = 0.77). Our findings also revealed that the dominant heat fluxes in the lake are the atmospheric longwave radiation (annual mean = 303.38 W m(-2)), water longwave radiation (annual mean = 336.01 W m(-2)), and the latent heat flux (annual mean = 51.14 W m(-2)). Additionally, the heat flux from the river inflows contribute minimally to the overall seasonal heat budget in the lake, being the Cebollati river the main contributor (annual average = 4.63 W m(-2)). Coupled large-scale hydrological and hydrodynamic models will benefit future modeling efforts by providing an effective management tool to study the effect of case scenarios (e.g., climate change) on temperature dynamics, heat fluxes, and physical and ecological processes in these ecosystems.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) and its dominant controls show obvious elevational pattern on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, due to heterogeneous environmental conditions regulated by altitude. To understand better how and why ET varies at different altitudes in the Qinghai Lake watershed, this study measured and retrieved soil moisture, solar radiation, and ET data between 3300 m and 4700 m, and further investigated the influence of water and energy conditions on ET. Results showed that, the mean annual terrestrial ET was 343 and 360 mm in this watershed in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The higher ET mainly appeared in the midstream of Shaliu River and on the southern region of Qinghai Lake, while the sand land on the east of Qinghai Lake and the bare rock in the northwest of the watershed had the lowest values. The ET increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of altitude, and its peak value appeared at 3600-3700 m. The dominant controls for ET switched from water conditions to energy conditions with the increase of elevation. The maximum limited fraction [(predicted value - actual value)/predicted value x 100] of ET by water condition (soil moisture content) achieved 11.2% and 10.1% at 3300-3350 m in 2014 and 2015, and the corresponding mean area-weighted values were 7.3% and 5.4% at 3300-3650 m, respectively. The maximum limited fraction of ET by energy condition (shortwave radiation and air temperature) achieved 24.4% and 29.8% at 4650-4700 m in 2014 and 2015, and the corresponding mean area-weighted values were 10.8% and 11.9% at 3650-4700 m, respectively. Overall, the energy conditions were more influential factors limiting the ET in the entire watershed, and this conclusion is critical for the management of regional terrestrial ecosystem with future climate change.

   Politics
AB Problems have a high rank in decision making when they are both urgent and important. Accordingly, water has not earned the attention it deserves in public policy agenda because under normal circumstances it is not viewed as an urgent matter in the eyes of the public and politicians. By creating a sense of urgency, extreme events such as droughts, floods, conflicts, and migrations can create opportunities for implementing some essential policy reforms that would be politically costly otherwise. So, despite their high short-term costs, extreme natural and societal events have the potential to increase the resilience of water systems in the long run. It is argued here that the societal and political sense of urgency about water must be promoted through public outreach and information dissemination. Otherwise, for useful reforms and long-term improvements, we will rely on costly and risky extreme events that sometimes have the potential to fully collapse the human-natural system-of-systems.

AB Interactions between surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) have been identified as a major contributing factor to non-stationarity in rainfall-runoff relationships. However, because existing rainfall-runoff models do not realistically account for these SW-GW interactions, they fail to robustly simulate runoff during multi-year droughts, especially in arid and semi-arid catchments that are relatively flat. Therefore, this study introduces a linked SW-GW modelling approach and tests it under different climatic conditions (Average, Dry and Wet periods) in two heterogeneous, semi-arid catchments in southeast Australia (SEA). The linked SW-GW modelling approach includes a fully-distributed SW (i.e. rainfall-runoff) model (SWATgrid) and a three-dimensional finite-difference GW model (MODFLOW). The results show that the linked SW-GW modelling approach produces highly improved runoff simulations for the study catchments, especially during dry conditions. These findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for SW-GW interactions when conducting rainfall-runoff modelling and highlights that failing to do so will result in overestimation of runoff during droughts - this is salient given projections for hotter and drier futures in many semi-arid regions. Although the study is focused on SEA, the insights gained are highly applicable for water managers in any region that experience high hydroclimatic variability or change.

AB The intensity-duration frequency (IDF) curve has been used as an effective tool to quantify the risk associated with the impact of extreme rainfall on civil infrastructure. However, recent changes in the rainfall climatology caused by climate change and urbanization have made estimates in the stationary environment provided by the traditional regional IDF approach increasingly inaccurate. This inaccuracy is mainly caused by the lack of consideration for the temporal and spatial differences in the selection of similarity indicators (attributes that are used to measure similarity of extreme rainfall patterns among different stations), resulting in ineffective formation of homogeneous groups (group of stations that share similar extreme rainfall patterns) at various regions. To consider the temporal differences of similarity indicators, including meteorological factors, topographic features and urban impact indicators, a three-layer design is proposed based on the three stages in extreme rainfall formation: cloud formation, rainfall generation and change of rainfall intensity over an urban surface. During the process, the impacts from climate change and urbanization on extreme rainfall patterns are considered through the inclusion of potential features that relate to the rainfall mechanism at each layer. The spatial differences of similarity indicators for Homogeneous Group Formation (HGF) at various regions is resolved by using an automatic feature selection and weighting algorithm, specifically the hybrid searching algorithm of Tabu Search, Lagrange Multiplier and Fuzzy C-means clustering, to select the optimal combination of features for HGF based on the uncertainty in the regional estimates of the rainfall quantiles for a specific site. The proposed methodology fills the gap of including the urbanization impacts on the extreme rainfall patterns during HGF process and challenges the traditional assumption that the same set of features can be equally effective in generating the optimal homogeneous group in regions with different geographic and meteorological characteristics.

AB The satisfactory separation of baseflow from the other components of streamflow has long been a desirable but elusive goal. In the search for consistent and automated baseflow separation techniques, direct applicability to physical processes has been increasingly neglected. By way of contrast, this paper presents a continuous baseflow separation method that emphasises the physical relevance of the flow components, and demonstrates its performance. The proposed method combines the principle of an exponential master baseflow recession with a compatible smoothing function to link the segments of the master recession. Two calibrated parameters facilitate a good fit to a range of streamflow behaviours.

A high frequency tropical typhoon area located on Northwest of Vietnam was selected as a case study. For this purpose, a GIS database for the study areas was prepared, including 654 flash-flood inundations and 12 influencing variables (elevation, slope, curvature, toposhade, aspect, topographic wetness index, stream power index, stream density, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, soil type, lithology, and rainfall), which were compiled from various sources. The database was used to build and verify the prediction model. We assessed the model's performance through various indices including Classification Accuracy Rate, Area under the Curve (AUC), Precision, and Recall. We also compared the model's usability with five state-of-the-art machine learning techniques including the Backpropagation Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Classification Tree. The results revealed that the hybrid PSO-MARS model outperformed other benchmark models in all the employed statistical measures. We conclude that the proposed model can be particularly suited for flash flood forecasting problems at high frequency tropical typhoon area.

AB Pore systems become very complex in heterogeneous reservoirs such as low-permeability and tight sandstones for macropores and micropores both exist in such reservoirs. Although the large pores may control the reservoir quality and rock properties, micropores always can affect the geometric and transport properties of the pore systems. In this paper, thus, such an effect is studied comprehensively. As such, low- and high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scanning experiments were carried out on the same low-permeability sandstone in order to obtain the low- and high-resolution digital rock (LRDR and HRDR) images, respectively. The impacts of micropores on properties of pore systems were investigated based on digital rock analysis of the LRDR and HRDR images for two samples. In this study, the micro-porosity is defined as the pores and throats which can be covered by the HRDR images but cannot be covered by the LRDR images. The results show that there are better connectivity, smaller tortuosity and higher heterogeneity for the HRDR image, compared to the LRDR image of the same rock. The fractal analysis of pore space indicates that the surface of the pore space with micropores becomes rougher. Moreover, we found that the micropore space plays a more significant role in the throats than the pores by comparing the pore and throat size distributions of the LRDR and HRDR images. In addition, the micropores can lead to a decrease in the average shape factor and smoothness of the boundary of pores and throats. It was also found that micro-porosity not only increases the average coordination number but also increases the number of isolated pores according to the coordination number distributions. Finally, the results of single- and two-phase flow simulation show that the absolute permeability and formation factor become larger and smaller, respectively, for the pore systems with micropores. This result reveals that micropores can improve the transportability and connectivity of the pore systems.

AB During the expansion of urban areas, small natural reserves have often been left intact within the built environment as central elements of biodiversity conservation, ecological connectivity, landscape sustainability, and quality of life of urban dwellers. Consequently, the surrounding urbanized landscape may impact the environmental conditions of these reserves (e.g., high temperatures, low moisture conditions), resulting in the need for extensive maintenance. This study presents an estimation of the water balance over two years (2017-2018) in three small urban reserves (between 2 and 30 ha) within the Greater Melbourne metropolitan area in Australia, for the purpose of understanding tree water use. Measurements of micrometeorological variables, soil moisture content profiles, water-table levels, sap flow velocities, and stem diameter variations were used to quantify the water sources of tree transpiration in these reserves. Results revealed that, despite the urban surroundings and the climate variations, these reserves have enough water to sustain tree transpiration. In two of the three reserves, groundwater was pivotal in sustaining transpiration rates; specifically, groundwater was estimated to contribute about 30-40% of the total transpiration amount during the driest periods of the year. Groundwater also played an essential role during nights with temperatures above 25 degrees C, helping trees to maintain night-time water use from 3 to 16% of the daily water use. In the third reserve, the presence of a shallow layer of heavy clay supplied water to the trees, which were able to maintain relatively constant transpiration rates throughout the year. These results demonstrate the importance of understanding the water regime of each urban reserve in order to support government authorities in preserving these ecosystems.

AB The generation of hydrometeorological time series that exhibit a given probabilistic and stochastic behavior across multiple temporal levels, traditionally expressed in terms of specific statistical characteristics of the observed data, is a crucial task for risk-based water resources studies, and simultaneously a puzzle for the community of stochastics. The main challenge stems from the fact that the reproduction of a specific behavior at a certain temporal level does not imply the reproduction of the desirable behavior at any other level of aggregation. In this respect, we first introduce a pairwise coupling of Nataf-based stochastic models within a disaggregation scheme, and next we propose their puzzle-type configuration to provide a generic stochastic simulation framework for multivariate processes exhibiting any distribution and any correlation structure. Within case studies we demonstrate two characteristic configurations, i.e., a three-level one, operating at daily, monthly and annual basis, and a two-level one to disaggregate daily to hourly data. The first configuration is applied to generate correlated daily rainfall and runoff data at the river basin of Achelous, Western Greece, which preserves the stochastic behavior of the two processes at the three temporal levels. The second configuration disaggregates daily rainfall, obtained from a meteorological station at Germany, to hourly. The two studies reveal the ability of the proposed framework to represent the peculiar behavior of hydrometeorological processes at multiple temporal resolutions, as well as its flexibility on formulating generic simulation schemes.

AB Forecasting ice jams and their consequential flooding is more challenging than predicting open water flood conditions. This is due to the chaotic nature of ice jam formation since slight changes in water and ice flows, location of the ice jam toe along the river and initial water levels at the time of jam formation can lead to marked differences in the outcome of backwater level elevations and flood severity. In this paper, we introduce a novel, operational real-time flood forecasting system that captures this stochastic nature of ice-jam floods and places the forecasts in a probabilistic context in the form of flood hazard maps (probability of flood extents and depths). This novel system was tested successfully for the ice-cover breakup period in the spring of 2018 along the Athabasca River at the Town of Fort McMurray, Canada.

AB Trees in semiarid conditions survive despite water scarcity and shallow soils because they commonly have access to subsoil water resources. Currently, conventional models do not include groundwater transpiration and the results frequently underestimate the actual evapotranspiration and overestimate the net recharge. Therefore, in this work we focus on how a multi-variable calibration with a multi-objective approach may improve model robustness leading to a more realistic closure of the water balance in two models (LEACHM and TETIS) of different conceptualisation taking into account the specific characteristics of a facultative phreatophytic forest. The results suggest that the common single-variable and single-objective calibration is not able to measure all system's characteristics. However, the multi-variable and multi-objective calibration proved a good option to reproduce the water dynamics of a facultative phreatophytic forest and confirmed that groundwater transpiration is an important water source for them. Therefore, hydrological models should include this mechanism and both LEACHM and TETIS proved an acceptable tool to be applied in the regions covered by this species.

AB Soil compaction during post-fire logging can increase runoff and erosion. Increasing surface cover is an effective way to reduce erosion, but this has not been tested on soils impacted by both fire and compaction. We measured the effects of compaction (bulk density of 0.9 or 1.1 g cm(-3)) and surface cover (0% or 60%) using bark mulch or logging slash (compacted only) on runoff, leaching and erosion. Four 0.5 m(2) plots per treatment were filled with burned soil and inclined to 18 degrees. Two 30-min simulated rainfall events with 72 nun h(-1) intensity and one concentrated flow event were applied to each plot.
   The runoff from the dry and wet runs totaled 32 mm in the uncompacted bare plots and the value was not significantly different for the compacted bare plots, any of the mulch plots, or the compacted slash plots. Leaching was higher for the uncompacted bare plots (7 mm) than for the compacted bare plots (1 mm), and mulch or slash did not affect leaching. The uncompacted bare plots produced 38 g of rainsplash and 497 g m(-2) of sheetwash, and these were about half the values for the compacted bare plots. Mulching strongly reduced the rainsplash and sheetwash for both the uncompacted (10 g and 184 g m(-2), respectively) and compacted conditions (19 g and 431 g m(-2), respectively), although the difference in sheetwash was only significant for the uncompacted plots. Slash also reduced rainsplash (19 g) relative to the compacted bare plots (74 g) but did not affect sheetwash. Concentrated flow produced 858 g m(-2) of rilling from the uncompacted bare plots, which was greater than the compacted plots (237 g m(-2)). Mulching reduced rilling by 95% in the uncompacted plots and 78% in the compacted plots, but slash did not reduce rilling.
   The reductions in rainsplash erosion caused by the mulch and slash were attributed to the increase in surface cover, which reduced the energy imparted to the soil by the rainfall. The mulch, with its high degree of contact with the soil, also reduced particle detachment and transport by overland flow. In contrast, the slash did not have complete contact with the soil surface and did not affect sheetwash or rilling. Compaction and the type of material used to increase surface cover are important factors to consider when assessing potential impacts of logging on runoff and sediment delivery from burned soils.

AB Groundwater is a priceless resource in Alberta and therefore, estimating groundwater are crucial to identifying and promoting holistic and integrated management of groundwater-surface water. However, it is a challenge to simulate groundwater storage due to the current rudimentary representation of two-way groundwater-surface water exchange in current hydrologic models, such as Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which, in turn, limits our ability to predict land-atmosphere processes and groundwater storage. In this study, we modified the SWAT model to improve module of evapotranspiration in two-way groundwater-surface water exchange. The modified SWAT was calibrated and validated against the groundwater table height and evapotranspiration from 2008 to 2011 period at two location (Lethbridge and Barons) Alberta, Canada. The results showed that the modified SWAT model predicts the groundwater table height very well at both locations. The modified model predicted the daily groundwater table height with R-2 values of 0.86 and 0.89 in the calibration period (2008-2009), 0.81 and 0.83 for the validation period (2010-2011) at Lethbridge and Barons, respectively. The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) for daily groundwater table height was 0.69 and 0.71 during calibration periods (2008-2009) while the model gives lower values of NSE 0.65 and 0.67 for validation periods (2010-2011) at Lethbridge and Barons, respectively. Similarly, the model estimates evapotranspiration well with correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.77 during the calibration period and 0.81 for validation period. Our result showed that the modified SWAT model did improve estimates to dynamic groundwater table heights.

AB Despite the expectation that increases in rainfall with climatic change will result in increases in pluvial flooding, there is more historical evidence for decreases in flood magnitude. In Australia, as in many other parts of the world, flood magnitudes are mostly decreasing, despite increasing rainfall extremes. Here, we show how changes in soil moisture have led to decreasing flood magnitudes while rainfall extremes have been increasing.
   Using gauged streamflow, catchment average rainfall, and modelled soil moisture data across Australia we confirm that streamflow peaks (or floods) that occur at least once a year are strongly related to both the peak rainfall causing the flood and the antecedent soil moisture conditions preceding the storm event. Regions where the magnitude of the peak flow has decreased are visually and statistically correlated to regions of decreasing soil moisture. Flood magnitudes are more likely to increase only for the rarest events, with increases in rainfall offset by decreases in soil moisture for more frequent events. A recurrence interval dependent tipping point is identified beyond which trends in catchment rainfall outweigh those of soil moisture trends and dominate the flood response. For regions where soil moisture has decreased, this tipping point occurs at an average recurrence interval of ten years or more. As most studies investigating trends in flooding generally use annual maxima, changes in soil moisture are likely to be the dominant mechanism behind observed flood trends. Hence changes in soil moisture conditions need to be considered when predicting catchment flood response due to climatic change.

AB There is a need for enhanced guidance in siting distributed, infiltrative green infrastructure (GI) practices, especially in densely developed urban watersheds where retrofits come at a high cost. To maximize the hydrologic benefit of GI practices on urban streams, the disconnection of effective impervious areas (EIA), or those impervious areas hydraulically connected to the stormwater network, has been identified as a strategic management approach that is expected to have the greatest impact. The overall effect of full disconnection of spatially-identified EIA on watershed hydrology is uncertain because this type of full disconnection is rarely brought to full-scale implementation. In this study, spatial EIA identification is used to parametrize an urban runoff model using the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). The calibrated model is used to assess runoff reductions resulting from GI practices distributed through the watershed via different placement strategies, both spatially-informed and not. Full treatment of the spatially identified EIA using bioretention cells was compared to two scenarios treating the same area of impervious surfaces, but with random placement either among all impervious areas or placement focused in areas of higher imperviousness. Model results indicate that substantially higher runoff reduction could be realized by targeting EIA, with a median runoff reduction of nearly 30% more than other treatment scenarios across storm events ranging from 1.27 to 20.7 mm using this strategic siting. Further improvements in optimizing distributed infiltrative GI practice placement are needed and targeting of spatially-identified EIA appears to be a viable method for increasing the hydrologic improvements realized through watershed scale implementations.

AB Vulnerability assessment is an essential step for urban flood risk management. Due to the objective existence of statistical errors in the variables and spatial heterogeneity, as well as the similarity of flood experience, precautionary status and environments for neighbouring areas, an urban flood vulnerability assessment essentially entails a multi-factor decision-making process that accounts for uncertainties and the local spatial dependence of neighbourhoods. To address these issues, an uncertainty-based vulnerability assessment approach embedded with an improved moving split-window (IMSW) analysis and probabilistic method is proposed. To develop an integrated urban flood vulnerability assessment model, three technical issues need to be resolved: (1) the development of damage curves of land-use types, (2) an uncertainty model and spatial dependence model of damages based on an IMSW analysis, and (3) an uncertainty-based framework to quantify vulnerability considering the uncertainties and local spatial dependence of the damage curves as well as the spatial heterogeneity of risky assets simultaneously. The proposed method is applied to an urban area in China and provides an integrated vulnerability assessment for different land-use types. Moreover, uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were performed to analyse the spatial differentiation and the dominant parameters of vulnerability. Compared with two other commonly used methods, the proposed local-correlated method (LCM) is more in line with reality, and provides more reasonable information for making a better-informed decision.

AB This study proposes a general differential split-sample test (GDSST) based on an oriented bootstrap to assess the transferability of conceptual rainfall-runoff models to climatically contrasting periods. Compared to existing benchmark techniques, the GDSST allows a larger number of climatically contrasted discontinuous periods to be sampled, and is computationally more effective than the basic bootstrap to identify the most contrasted periods. When applied to three hydrological models (GR4J, HBV and IHACRES) in five catchments in northern Tunisia, the GDSST provided clear limits of the transferability of the models under changing precipitation (P) and temperature (T) conditions towards drier and hotter conditions. According to the criteria and thresholds retained, approximate limits of model transferability are drawn. The models are roughly transferable for relative changes in precipitation Delta P < (0.08 Delta T-0.18) with Delta P is an element of [-30%, +80%), and changes in temperature Delta T is an element of [-2 degrees C, + 2 degrees C). These transferability limits suggest selecting a past sub-period as close as possible to the future climate to identify calibration parameters, which can be used for hydrological projections. The limits of transferability were then compared to climate projections by eight high-resolution Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulations resulting from the EURO-CORDEX initiative. The RCMs' precipitation and temperature simulations of the historical period 1970-2000 were first assessed to select the most realistic ones for future projections. A delta-change monthly correction was used to perturb the observed climate series according to climate simulations under two Radiative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for one medium-term horizon (2040-2070) and one long-term horizon (2070-2100). The effects of the selected past calibration period on the hydrological projections were then analysed. The RCP 8.5 climate projections fall outside the limits of transferability of all rainfall-runoff models tested. Models calibrated on the whole observed period were found to underestimate the impacts of climate change on runoff by 5%-20% in comparison with models calibrated on sub-periods with mean annual P and T closer to projected climate conditions.

AB The joint spatiotemporal modeling of aquifer level fluctuations provides a significant tool in the prediction of groundwater levels at unvisited locations. Two types of variogram functions, appropriately modified to incorporate physical information, are presented and compared under Space-time Residual kriging methodology using the Bayesian Bootstrap idea to quantify uncertainty. The spatiotemporal trend is approximated using a component of physical meaning. A recently developed Spartan type non-separable variogram function employs tools of physical meaning to enhance the efficiency and reliability of spatiotemporal geostatistical modeling in groundwater applications. In addition, the product-sum space-time variogram is applied and involves in the separable variogram functions a scale factor of hydraulic conductivity directional ratio. The proposed variogram functions involve a non-Euclidean distance metric and are mathematically valid (i.e., constitutes permissible models). Herein, the efficiency of the proposed tools is tested using groundwater level data from an alluvial unconfined aquifer. Both functions provide improved results compared to those of the Space-time Ordinary kriging. Between the two, the non-separable one has the most efficient performance.

AB With increasing population and urbanization in the deltas across global mega-river basins, groundwater stress is increasing due to changing ocean-land disposition, hydroclimatic extremes, over-exploitation and natural/anthropogenic contamination. Such change in coastal hydrodynamic process makes an impact in to the resilience of groundwater-sourced drinking water vulnerability. The groundwater responses studied in this work in the ecologically-vulnerable, UNESCO World Heritage site of the Sundarbans delta-front aquifers at the river Ganges-Brahmaputra mega delta, demonstrate a unique example of such intricacies and complexities. High-resolution, temporal, depth-dependent hydraulic connectivity and hydrochemistry was studied for this complex, climate driven, tidal-induced hydrological interactions between surface water (seawater of Bay of Bengal [BoB] and Ganges river water) with shallow and deep groundwater by stable isotopic (delta O-18 and delta D) signatures and piezometry. A wide range of salinity content and delta O-18 composition of groundwater samples for 14-25 (salinity: 3-45 ppT, delta O-18: -3.63 to -1.15 parts per thousand) and 30-50 meter below ground level (mbgl) (salinity: 5-25 ppT, delta O-18: -3.41 to -1.34 parts per thousand) was recorded, while, comparatively, a narrow range of temporal variability was observed for the depths of 115 (salinity: 1-4 ppT, delta O-18: -5.04 to -2.15 parts per thousand) and 333mbgl (salinity: 1 to 3 ppT, delta O-18: -4.43 to -2.81 parts per thousand). Study results revealed that vertical transport of solute has been induced by coastal hydrodynamics. However, human interferences, in terms of groundwater abstraction and land use-land cover change (e.g. brackish aquaculture) do have substantial impact on evolving groundwater response, thereby impacting resilience to drinking water option in this densely populated area. Fluctuations of groundwater level in relation with delta O-18(gw), composition showed shallow depths (14-50 mbgl) are hydraulically connected by local flow and conducive of chemical exchanges. The deeper groundwater (115-330 mbgl depths) flow suggests regional-scale hydraulic connections along flow paths. In-spite of sub-meter scale seasonal groundwater level changes, salinity variability is observed between 1 and 4 ppT at > 100 mbgl depths, suggest mixing between chemically-distinct water reservoirs, conserving hydraulic mass-balance. However, such observation suggests severe implications for groundwater vulnerability, which might aggravate with future intensification of irrigational abstraction, as well as with changing hydroclimatological regime and extreme events. Thus, future planning and management strategies of sustainable supply of safe water in such ecologically-sensitive groundwater systems need to incorporate such dynamic chemical evolution.

AB The stable hydrogen (delta D) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotope composition of modern meteoric water are influenced by changes in global temperature, Rayleigh distillation processes, and moisture transport history. However, on a global scale the relative influence of these different meteorological variables is spatially heterogeneous. We collected daily precipitation samples from meteorological stations in the Armenian Highlands for a period of one year in order to determine the constraints on delta D and delta O-18 and relationship to broader climatic conditions. These data are coupled with HYSPLIT back-trajectory analysis to determine how these compositions relate to moisture source and transport path. Multivariate analysis shows the strongest relationship between delta D and delta O-18 and climate variables is temperature at the sampling site. Along with temperature, the intensity of the North Atlantic Oscillation, a pattern of atmospheric circulation which determines the strength and location of Northern Hemisphere midlatitude westerlies, is significant (p < 0.05) for both delta O-18 and delta D values of precipitation. This correlation between NAO and isotopes in precipitation is also observed in four nearby GNIP stations from 2008 to 2015. Negative NAO phases are associated with weakened westerlies, which allows precipitation enriched in heavy isotopes from the Mediterranean and southerly sources to penetrate into the Armenian Highlands, whereas positive NAO phases are associated with stronger westerlies bringing more negative precipitation from the Black Sea. This relationship is most significant (p < 0.001) during the winter and spring months (December to May). These data demonstrate that paleo-archives of SD and delta O-18 in the Armenian Highlands could serve as a tool to measure changes in the NAO in the past, particularly when coupled with independent measurements of temperature.

AB Knowledge of the geologic structure at a field site is a useful piece of information for hydrologic modeling since it can serve as more site-specific prior information about the hydraulic parameter patterns at the site than generic spatial statistics. Widely accepted electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) survey for mapping subsurface anomalies could be a viable tool for acquiring this information. However, their ability to delineate geologic structures has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, two-dimensional ERT numerical experiments were first conducted to study the effects of boundary conditions on the dipole-dipole and pole-pole array configurations. An ERT setup subsequently was implemented in a sandbox consisting of complex layers of different sands. A continuous copper wire was installed along the sides of the sandbox to impose potential boundaries. Using data collected with the pole-pole array in the sandbox under different degrees of drainage and the Successive Linear Estimator (SLE) algorithm, we show that ERT yields electrical conductivity estimates of complex layer structures with small uncertainties. In addition, using SLE with physically meaningful correlation scales as prior information can lead to an electrical conductivity field that is consistent with visually observed layer structures. The correlation scale concept also was demonstrated to provide guidance to the design of the electrode spacing in the surveys. Moreover, the estimated field was validated by predicting electrical potential fields from two independent ERT surveys using electrodes at different locations. Results of this study suggest that the combination of ERT and SLE is a viable geophysical survey tool for mapping geologic layer structures.
   Research Significance: This study develops a method to implement prescribed potential boundaries for enhancing the pole-pole ERT survey, illustrates the importance of correlation scales and develops an approach for validating ERT results.

AB Current precipitation measurements are conducted largely by simple automatic rain gauges. Despite being error prone and sometimes of questionable accuracy, the procedure is still widely used. In recent years new possibilities have emerged, which are based on different measuring principles. Although the application of alternative devices is increasing, its use in research is limited. In this study, precipitation measurements by different devices were compared, and systematic errors caused by individual characteristics were corrected. Data were collected by means of a monitoring network, which included a piezoelectric precipitation sensor mounted at 2.3 m, a standard tipping bucket at 1 m, and a weighable gravitation lysimeter at ground level. As measurements at ground level are considered as optimum, the records of the lysimeter were thereby determined as a reference. The results showed that precipitation measured by elevated rain gauges differed in total between -6.8% and + 35% compared to rainfall measured by the lysimeter. The records correlated well, but the analyses indicated a strong influence of the precipitation intensity on the recorded amount of precipitation. The deviations between values of the rain gauges and those of the lysimeter increased with rainfall intensity. In general, the tipping bucket demonstrated negative error values and indicated an underestimation of precipitation compared to records at ground level, whereas the piezoelectric precipitation sensor showed an overestimation by highly positive error values. A subsequent precipitation correction through the linear scaling method improved significantly the raw data of the rain gauges.

AB Accurate estimation of soil moisture content is necessary for optimal management of water and soil resources. Soil moisture is an important variable in the hydrologic cycle, which plays an important role in the global water and energy balance due to its impact on hydrological, ecological, and meteorological processes. The purpose of the present study was to explore a newly developed hybrid intelligent model for simulating soil moisture content. A hybrid adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model-grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm was designed here and validated against the neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR) and standalone ANFIS models. The models input parameters were di-electric constant, soil bulk density, clay content and organic matter of 1155 soil samples. Various statistical indices were employed to evaluate the performances of the applied models. For a reliable ranking of models, the Global Performance Indicator (GPI) was utilized, which is a 5-agent index. The results evidenced the feasibility of the developed hybrid ANFIS-GWO model with superior simulation results. At the testing stage, the MAE and SI values for the ANFIS-GWO were 1.468% and 0.098, respectively, which indicated the superiority of the ANFIS-GWO compared to the ANFIS-Fuzzy C mean (MAE = 6.427%, SI = 0.354), and ANFIS-sub clustering (MAE = 2.137%, SI = 0.141) models. Based on the GPI, the ANFIS-GWO model was ranked as the best model, followed by the standalone ANFIS and SVR models, while the worst accuracy was attained through ANN model. The ANFIS-GWO model improved the simulation accuracy by 48% and 50%, respectively, compared to the standalone ANFIS and SVR models. In addition, based on the GPI, the ANFIS-GWO model presented an enhancement of about 77 percent compared to the ANN model. The high accuracy of the ANFIS-GWO model compared to the standalone ANFIS model represents the performance of the GWO algorithm for escaping local optima, which makes the ANFIS-GWO as a powerful tool for estimating soil moisture. Overall, the explored hybrid intelligent models demonstrated a reliable pedotransfer function of soil moisture where it can contribute to several geo-sciences engineering principles.

AB Climate change and gullies (and ditches) on peatlands are well known factors altering peat hydrology. Yet, exactly how this alteration emerges from interaction of these factors with groundwater dynamics is still not fully understood. In this study, we tackled this issue by coupling field measurement with model simulation using Visual MODFLOW. Groundwater processes and the associated water budget during five months of the wet season, 2017 were examined in the Zoige peatland, located on the northeastern side of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China with elevations of 3400-3900 m. Simulations were performed for a peatland area of 3.89 x 10(4) m(2) and three sub-zones within it representing peatland with no gullies (NG), a deep gully cutting through the peat layer (CT), and a shallow gully whose bed is within the peat layer (NCT). Model input parameters were calibrated and validated using the field-measured data. Modeling outcomes led to water budget showing relative contributions of main hydrological pathways (MHPs) (i.e., precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), gully, groundwater flow, and boundary) to changes of water storage in peats (AS). Although these MHPs varied differently during rain and inter-rain periods, AS values were mainly controlled by the oscillated trend of the difference between P and ET. Variations of MHPs caused by NCT and CT were secondary to those due to those of P and ET during the wet season referred to as the short-term climate change. Vertical groundwater (VGW) flows were strongly correlated with water table (WT) levels in both rain and inter-rain periods, but their directions had different patterns in the two periods. Horizontal groundwater (HGW) flows tended to move into the deep (CT) gully, while move from the shallow (NCT) gully to the neighbor peats during both periods. Since HGW flows were about ten times greater than VGW ones, their effect on AS was significant during the long dry season. This would lead to continuous loss of groundwater stored in peats, demonstrating the coupled effect of long-term climate change and gullies on AS. These findings underline the necessity of controlling gully development and avoiding ditch excavation in future Zoige peatland management practices.

AB Unconfined aquifers sometimes overlie fractured bedrocks, consisting of unconfined-fractured aquifer systems. Pumping induced hydrodynamics in such aquifer systems has not received much attention as in other types of aquifer systems. This paper aims to obtain semi-analytical solutions of flow to a general well configuration in such an unconfined-fractured two-layer aquifer system. The examples of general well configuration, specifically discussed here, include: 1) a horizontal well, 2) a vertical well, 3) a vertical well with one horizontal collector, and 4) a vertical well with two horizontal collectors which are perpendicular with each other. The methodology is general and can be extended to other types of wells with minor modifications of solutions developed in this study. The point sink/source solution is first obtained using double infinite Fourier and Laplace transformations (where sink is for pumping and source is for injection). The line sink/source solution is then obtained via integrating the point sink/source along the desired direction and following the principle of superposition. The de Hoog numerical inverse Laplace transform and Gaussian Quadrature are used to obtain time-domain dimensionless drawdown solutions. The instantaneous drainage of water table and the inter-porosity flow of the underlying fractured aquifer are taken into account. The effects of the length of horizontal well on dimensionless drawdown and dimensionless drawdown derivative, and scaled sensitivity of the hydraulic parameters of the underlying fractured aquifer are explored. The dimensionless drawdowns and drawdown derivatives of a vertical pumping well, a vertical well with a single horizontal collector and a vertical well with two perpendicular horizontal collectors are also compared. The scaled sensitivity of dimensionless drawdown to the hydraulic parameters of the underlying fractured aquifer of these different pumping well structures is explored. The results of this study can be used to evaluate the hydraulic parameters using the drawdown data collected during a pumping test performed in a general well configuration in a unconfined-fractured two-layer aquifer system. Furthermore, the presented solutions can be utilized to design the pumping well to minimize drawdown in low permeability or thin aquifers. By eliminating the inter-porosity flow term from the underlying fractured aquifer, the solutions are applicable to groundwater flow to a pumping well in leaky aquifers.

AB Irrespective of the magnitude and spatial extend, the consequences of a natural hazard are strongly connected to the vulnerability of elements at risk (e.g. people, buildings and infrastructure). It is, therefore, obvious that an analysis and quantification of vulnerability is required for successful disaster risk reduction. The need for vulnerability assessment is crucial due to the effects of climate change as well as the socio-economic dynamics that may directly impact vulnerabilities and coping capacities of affected communities. Vulnerability is multidimensional (physical, social, economic, etc.), however, the dimension which is mainly related to the direct costs and threat to human lives is the physical one. We focus here on the physical vulnerability of buildings subject to torrential hazards occurring in small and steep mountain catchments. These processes include fluvial sediment transport, debris floods, and debris flows. Furthermore, we included flash flood hazards if these are related to torrential catchments. Physical vulnerability to torrential hazards in mountain areas is a topic that has been under scientific investigation over the last 20 years. Several methods to assess physical vulnerability of buildings towards flash floods, debris flows and hyper-concentrated flows can be found in the literature. The plethora of methods and approaches may be classified under the following three categories: vulnerability matrices, vulnerability curves and vulnerability indices. We provide a short review of these methods which became available over the last decade and which dominate the scientific debate in mountain hazard risk management, giving an emphasis to vulnerability curves. The approaches presented herein are highlighted through case studies from the European Alps and beyond. Furthermore, challenges in vulnerability assessment including data requirements, need for improved event documentation, uncertainties and challenges related to future climate and socio-economic changes are outlined. Finally, a discussion on progress-driving factors such as new technologies (e.g. mobile apps, drones), citizen science and new innovative assessment methods is provided.

AB We present a novel ensemble extension of the conditional bias-penalized Kalman filter, referred to herein as the conditional bias-penalized ensemble Kalman filter (CBEnKF), and apply it to flood forecasting. The CBEnKF differs from most data assimilation (DA) techniques in that it minimizes a weighted sum of the error variance and the expected value of the Type-II conditional bias squared for improved estimation and prediction of extremes. To assess the ability of the CBEnKF to improve flood prediction, we carried out real-world DA experiments in which the CBEnKF and the EnKF were applied under identical conditions for assimilation of hourly streamflow observations into the lumped Sacramento soil moisture accounting and unit hydrograph models. Ten headwater basins in Texas, whose drainage areas and times-to-peak range from 137 to 1037 km(2) and from 3 to 21 hrs, respectively, were used in the twin experiments. All events in a 10-yr period with peak flow exceeding 100 m(3)/s were used. Verification of the ensemble mean predictions indicates that the CBEnKF improves the multi-basin mean of the mean square error skill score over the EnKF by about 0.15 over lead times of up to the time-to-peak of the basin. Verification of the ensemble predictions indicates that the CBEnKF improves the mean continuous ranked probability skill score by about 0.2 on average over the EnKF for all ranges of flow within the significant events, and by about 0.3 for flows exceeding the 95th percentile in those events. That the gain in skill is larger for larger flows makes the CBEnKF very appealing despite the significantly higher computational cost.

AB Damming is one of the major methods that human being secure reliable freshwater. It can change flow magnitude and regime along a river, particularly for Transboundary Rivers shared by multiple jurisdictions. This study develops a coupled framework to assess both the current and future cumulative impacts of damming on downstream water availability for data-sparse regions like the Tibetan Plateau. The framework is applied to the Brahmaputra River Basin (BRB), where dam developments on the Tibetan Plateau are highly concerned. The results show that, despite being part of the 'Asian water tower', the Yarlung Tsangpo River (YTR) contributes just 15-16% to Brahmaputra streamflow, for 48% of its contributing area. We found that the maximum impact due to five recently constructed dams in YTR suggests about 8-11% reduction of mean annual streamflow at outlet of Brahmaputra River. The impacts of damming would be largely offset by runoff increases under the climate scenarios projected by 28 CMIP5 model outputs from RCP4.5 median-level emission scenarios and 29 CMIP5 model outputs from RCP8.5 high-level emission scenarios for the period of 2049 to 2075, compared to the historical period of 1979 to 2005. Our results suggest that it is necessary to use our framework or a similar one to comprehensively evaluate the maximum possible damming impact across the Transboundary Rivers.

AB This paper focuses on water allocation in an irrigation district considering water rights transaction. The relationship between the reservoir authority and the sub-area managers is explored based on a novel Stackelberg-Nash-Cournot equilibrium model. In this framework, the reservoir authority has higher priority in allocating initial water rights to Sancha town, Danjing and Xinmin villages; after get the decisions from the reservoir authority, the sub-area managers decide water distribution to multi-crops planting areas and water rights transaction with the promise of Nash-Cournot equilibrium, then the reservoir authority can modify his decision by Stackelberg strategic interaction. To obtain the optimal irrigation strategy, fuzzy goal programming and genetic algorithm methods are applied. In this context, a Stackelberg-Nash-Cournot equilibrium solution can be obtained. The proposed model is applied to Sancha irrigation area, and the results show that more available water can be distributed in Sancha town while guaranteeing the equity among the sub-areas in this irrigation district; more water was utilized for wheat and oilseed rape than paddy and bean, which matched the fact that wheat and oilseed rape grow in quarters with relatively less rainfall inflows. A changeable and uncertain environment, regarding inflow levels, planting areas, and irrigation coefficient, take potential challenges to agricultural irrigation process. Hence, to cope with the challenges, cope with the future uncertainty and offer more information on the adjustment of agricultural irrigation patterns, scenario technique is applied by changing the three parameters inflow levels, planting areas, and irrigation coefficient respectively. Finally, to highlight the superiority of the proposed model, a comparative analysis is conducted in a situation without considering the water market, which verifies the importance and effectiveness of water rights transaction.

AB Chinese cities have been experiencing unprecedented growth for over three decades and the resulting urbanization is having a remarkable impact on the hydrological cycle at the local and regional scale. This study therefore examined the influence of urbanization on nonstationarity of annual and seasonal precipitation extremes in China, using daily precipitation data from 1857 stations for 1961-2014, and NCAR/NCEP and ERA Interim reanalysis datasets. Results of trend, change point, and bootstrap analyses revealed that urban signatures on long-term changes (i.e. trends and magnitudes) of precipitation extremes were not prominently visible at the national scale. However, a nonstationary frequency analysis of precipitation extremes by a Generalized Additive Model for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) framework with a cluster of 66 models showed that urbanization caused nonstationarity in precipitation extremes at local and regional scales, such as North China. Further, significant nonstationarity tended to occur more in urbanizing areas than in rural and urbanized areas, suggesting that land use/land cover (LULC) transition (i.e. rural areas turning into urban areas) played an important role in introducing nonstationarity. Furthermore, analysis of large-scale circulation patterns, using k-mean clustering, showed that urban signatures on extremes were not prominent at the national scale but at the regional scale. Further studies are needed to enumerate physical mechanisms causing the impact of local environmental changes on precipitation extremes at different geographical locations over China.

AB Groundwater capture and storage loss play a major role in the sustainable exploitation of a regional aquifer. This study aimed to identify the impact of major and long-term groundwater exploitation on a regional aquifer system to understand the processes controlling the sustainable exploitation of the transboundary Milk River Aquifer (MRA). The MRA extends over 26,300 km(2), being a major water resource across southern Alberta (Canada) and northern Montana (USA). Concerns about the sustainability of the MRA were raised as the century-old exploitation has led to important drawdowns and the local loss of historical artesian conditions. A steady-state numerical model of the regional flow system was developed and calibrated against hydraulic heads, groundwater fluxes, and the area with flowing artesian wells. Four groundwater abstraction scenarios were simulated: 1) natural flow conditions without exploitation; 2) the mean abstraction rate over the last 108 years; 3) the historical maximum global abstraction rate of the MRA; and 4) a theoretical high abstraction rate based on the maximum rate estimated for each MRA exploitation zone. The numerical model agrees with the previously formulated conceptual model and supports its hydraulic plausibility. Results show that MRA exploitation has led to a major change in flow patterns to sustain groundwater abstraction. The MRA water balance under exploitation indicates that more recharge and reduced seepage to bedrock valleys compensate groundwater withdrawals. Based on its impact on regional discharge and the reduction in MRA storage, the mean historical level of exploitation of the MRA appears sustainable. Larger exploitation rates would significantly reduce groundwater discharge to surface seepage locations and lead to a larger reduction in groundwater storage in the MRA. Modeling also illustrates that the MRA is an internationally shared resource. This situation would justify a joint management of the aquifer system between Canada and USA; especially in the area comprised between the recharge area in Montana and the Canadian reach of the Milk River.

AB The lack of stream gauging data worldwide has inspired an abundance of methods attempting to predict the complex natural process of streamflow. A set of traditional regression equations have been developed by the U.S. Geological Survey for the state of Iowa. However, several inconsistencies were noted, including irregular region definition and varying input parameters between regions. To overcome the common problems faced in modelling, and to combat the irregularities in the regression equations, a new Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) algorithm has been proposed using a combination of the classical combinatorial GMDH and multilayer GMDH to predict the 2-year peak flow. Data from 365 stream gauges located in the state of Iowa were used in the model development. The new algorithm was compared to the two classical algorithms and the traditional linear regression equations developed by the U.S. Geological Survey. The new algorithm which requires fewer input parameters without relying on regionalization was found to be the best method. The developed algorithm is based on a more robust hydrologic theory and therefore is a reliable method for predicting the 2-year peak flow for ungauged basins. The two main hypotheses inspired by the past regression equations and suggested in this study were that regionalization is not necessary and that using fewer input parameters to avoid redundancy still produces a robust prediction method. This study has developed a novel and reliable prediction method for peak flow prediction at ungauged basins while advancing insight into the most influential variables governing the magnitude of the flow.

AB Dam-break flows in both triangular and rectangular channels are investigated experimentally in the present study. Laboratory measurements are carried out in a prismatic and smooth flume with a horizontal and wet bed for two different reservoir heads and four tailwater levels. During the experiments, digital image processing is applied as a flow measurement technique. Both water surface profiles and stage hydrographs are obtained effectively by means of video images with eight adjacent cameras. The dam-break flows in triangular and rectangular channels show common features: jet formation in the downstream of the dam during the initial dam break stage; similarity of the water surface profiles behind the dam for different depth ratios at a specific time; insignificant effects of the depth ratio on the negative wave front; and strong dependence of the shock wave front on the depth ratio. In a triangular channel, the negative wave front moves slower than that in a rectangular channel; and extra negative waves propagating towards upstream direction does not form for all depth ratios considered in this study while they have been observed in a rectangular channel for large values of a representing the ratio of initial tailwater depth and reservoir depth (i.e., alpha = 0.3 and 0.4). Meantime, these extra negative waves result in an undulation of the water surface profile in the reservoir and an apparent increase of water depth at the dam. The water depth at the dam section for different depth ratios is 60-70% of the initial reservoir head; and the shock wave front propagates slower as the depth ratio increases for the triangular channel. For water depth ratios alpha = 0.1 and 0.2, the shock wave front moves faster than that in a rectangular channel, and the contrary is true for alpha = 0.4. For alpha = 0.3, the propagation speed of the shock wave front approximates that in a rectangular channel. Present study contributes to the understanding of the effect of wet downstream conditions on dam-break flows in triangular channels and provides detailed experimental data for validating both the analytical and the numerical solutions.

AB Among different sources of uncertainty in hydrologic modeling (i.e., model structure, parameter estimation, input data, etc.), consecutive error reduction of model initial conditions can prevent a model from drifting away from reality and consequently improving model estimates. Most approaches that evaluated the correction of initial conditions through data assimilation (DA) have focused on improving hydrologic model simulations (i.e., under observed forcings) rather than evaluating the model performance in a forecasting context. This paper investigates the utility of Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) data assimilation in which available observed streamflow is exploited to update state variables of a conceptual water balance model for forecasting monthly streamflow over 340 rainfall-dominated river basins across the contiguous United States (CONUS). Our results demonstrate that after EnKF application, streamflow simulation skill improves in terms of both Relative Root Mean Square Error (R-RMSE) and correlation coefficient (CC) for almost 90% of the selected river basins. Evaluating the model performance under different flow conditions shows that EnKF has stronger positive effect on monthly low flow predictions comparing to monthly high flows particularly during the summer season. The utility of EnKF is also assessed in the context of 1-month ahead streamflow forecasting. Due to the updated model initial conditions, streamflow forecasts are improved throughout the year even though the skill in hydrologic forecasts is predominantly dependent on the accuracy of precipitation forecasts.

AB In some countries the spent nuclear fuel produced by nuclear power plants will be deposited in crystalline granitic rock formations. In Finland, a repository for the spent nuclear fuel is being built at Olkiluoto. The safety assessment of the repository requires a careful determination of the transport properties of the bedrock. The porosity of the bedrock and the effective diffusion coefficients and distribution coefficients of different radio-nuclides for the bedrock are used as the main parameters in the safety assessment calculations. It has been questioned whether the parameters determined using laboratory experiments can be used to estimate the parameters in the in situ conditions. In this study, laboratory and in situ water phase diffusion experiments (WPDEs) were performed to resolve the issue. In the experiments, the transport of tritiated water (HTO), Cl-36, and Na-22 was studied using similar experimental setups. Mathematical models were constructed and solved to determine the transport parameters from the measured breakthrough curves. On average, the in situ WPDEs resulted in 20 (+/- 6)% smaller porosities and 32 (+/- 10)% smaller effective diffusion coefficients for HTO and Cl-36 than the laboratory WPDEs. It was also found that in veined gneiss, the most dominant rock type of the Olkiluoto bedrock, anion exclusion reduced the retention parameters of Cl-36 compared with those of HTO. Furthermore, the distribution coefficient of Na-22 for veined gneiss was about one order of magnitude smaller in the in situ conditions than in previous laboratory batch sorption experiments. The effects of the results on the safety assessment were evaluated and discussed.

AB Weather generators (WGs) are tools that create synthetic weather data, which are statistically similar to the observed data. Considering the limitations of most rainfall generators to preserve satisfactorily the fundamental statistical properties (e.g., spatial and temporal coherence) simultaneously, we propose a new framework for multisite rainfall generation. The framework consists of three main components: (1) a spatiotemporal rainfall field, described as spatial modes and their corresponding temporal evolution based on empirical orthogonal function analysis (EOFA). (2) The time series of these spatial modes, decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with characteristic frequencies (periods) using Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT). (3) Stochastic simulation (SS), achieved by assigning random phases for the specific IMFs. The current model, EHS (EOFA + HHT + SS), is compared with two other typical multi-site rainfall generators, MulGETS (parametric model) and KNN (non-parametric model) for a network of 12 stations in Xiang River basin, China. These three models are assessed based on their ability to simulate sequences with statistical attributes that are similar to those observed. We compare the basic statistics (mean, standard deviation, skewness), extreme value characteristics (95th percentile and maximum), spatial dependence (spatial correlation and spatial continuity ratio), and temporal dependence statistic (autocorrelation, wet/dry spells, and low-frequency variability). The results show that EHS rainfall generator has a similar capacity as KNN model in reproducing the spatial structure of the original rainfall field, and has a greater ability than MulGETS and KNN model to preserve the historical temporal statistics, especially the autocorrelation at various time scales and low-frequency variability. Overall, EHS is a useful model for generating realistic multi-site rainfall field and can be expected to generate plausible scenarios for impact studies.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

   Urban flooding
AB The real-time forecasting of urban flooding is a challenging task for the following two reasons: (1) urban flooding is often characterized by short lead times, (2) the uncertainty in precipitation forecasting is usually high. Standard physically based numerical models are often too slow for the use in real-time forecasting systems. Data driven models have small computational costs and fast computation times and may be useful to overcome this problem. The present study presents an artificial neural network based model for the prediction of maximum water levels during a flash flood event. The challenge of finding a suitable structure for the neural network was solved with a new growing algorithm. The model is successfully tested for spatially uniformly distributed synthetic rain events in two real but slightly modified urban catchments with different surface slopes. The computation time of the model in the order of seconds and the accuracy of the results are convincing, which suggest that the method may be useful for real-time forecasts.

AB Intertidal wetlands are widely considered to be vulnerable to storm impacts. While much attention has been given to the effect of hurricane/typhoon landfall on local erosion/deposition in intertidal wetlands, less is known about how distant hurricanes/typhoons can affect an intertidal wetland or about the comprehensive effects of hurricanes/typhoons on hydrodynamics, sediment transport and seabed stability. Here, we investigate the possible impacts of thirteen typhoons that occurred in the western Pacific during summer autumn 2016 on an intertidal wetland in the Yangtze Delta. We detected the impacts from eight of the typhoons during half of their duration when these typhoons were 450-2000 km away (nearest distance ever for each typhoon) from the delta. These remote typhoons caused 2-5 times maximum increases in hydrodynamics and suspended sediment concentration. Correspondingly, considerable net mudflat erosion and marsh deposition were observed. We therefore conclude that intertidal wetlands can be strongly affected by typhoons, even those passing by hundreds of kilometres away. These findings contribute to understand how far and in what extent hurricanes/typhoons can affect intertidal wetlands and to increase knowledge needed for coastal management.

AB This study investigates moisture origin, characteristics and intra-event scale variability of the isotopic signature of rainfall in a Mediterranean mountain area, based on data from the Vallcebre Research Catchments, NE Spain. Weekly data and samples were used to analyse the general dynamics of the isotopic composition of precipitation and its relationship with meteorological variables at the sampling site. Then, based on the data and samples available at the intra-event scale, the variability of the isotopic signature during rainfall events was characterised and an explanation of what caused the observed variability was attempted. Results at the weekly time scale show that the maximum relative deviation of the heavy isotopic content with respect to Standard Mean Ocean Water (delta O-18) of the precipitation signature occurred during summer months and, in contrast, the minimum during winter months. The intra-annual trend of rainfall delta O-18 roughly followed the mean monthly air temperature. Using intra-event information, three main types of delta O-18 isotopic trends were found during rainfall events: most of the events had a V-shaped isotopic trend, followed by L-shaped and constant trend events. Changes in moisture sources 'diagnosed using a Lagrangian approach and a previously existing contribution algorithm' were one of the causes of the isotopic variability and changes at the intra-event scale, but these may also have been influenced by sub-cloud processes that modified the isotopic signature. Moisture sources for analysed events showed the main influence of the Mediterranean area, but also an important influence of the Atlantic Basin.

AB Advances in sensor technologies provide the potential for real-time monitoring of soil moisture status. Little work has been conducted to study the spatial and temporal variations of soil water content at the field scale and the interactions between soil water content and environmental controlling factors in cropped fields during the growing season. In this study, we assessed the spatial and temporal variations of surface soil water content (0-0.1 m) using seven in-situ soil moisture probes and Sentinel-1 satellite data over the 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons in irrigated fields of the Central Sands Plains, Wisconsin, USA. An empirical multiple linear regression model was developed between the soil water content with Sentinel-1 backscatter data. The model was evaluated with leave-one-group-out cross-validation, which showed an R-2 of 0.60, mean error of -0.00 m(3) m(-3), root mean square error of 0.02 m(3) m(-3), and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient of 0.75. Soil volumetric water content (VWC) and soil water deficit (SWD) were mapped at 30-m resolution every 6-12 days across one field (DU field at the Wallendal farm). Using two statistical metrics ("first metric" and "last metric") and a bootstrapping approach, the location-specific and time-dependent interactions between estimated soil water content and environmental controlling factors across the DU field during the cropping season were evaluated, and it was found that such interactions were affected by initial soil water content and plant stress status. The robustness of the model needs to be improved in the future by collecting more VWC measurements in different soil and crop conditions. The method has the potential to provide a baseline soil moisture map and can be coupled with mechanistic models and subsoil VWC measurements for improved irrigation management and water use efficiency under a changing climate.

AB There has been a series of water resource problems, such as imbalances of the water supply and demand and serious water pollution, in China. It is important for the Chinese government to formulate a sustainable development strategy for water resources and to effectively guarantee the national water resource security. This paper divides the comprehensive carrying capacity of water resources into the following three aspects: the water resource balance capacity, the water resource pressure and driving force, and the water resource development and utilization capacity. Taking 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of China as research objects, the catastrophe progression method is adopted to evaluate the comprehensive carrying capacity of interprovincial water resources in China from 2010 to 2016. The direct effects and spatial spillover effects of different factors on water resources are discussed by constructing a spatial Durbin model (SDM). The results show that there are obvious spatial differences in the water resource balance ability, pressure and driving force, and development and utilization ability. The spatial distribution follows a decreasing trend from east to west and from south to north. The water supply, water demand, investment in environmental management, economic development and balance of the ecosystem have obvious direct effects on the carrying capacity of water resources. The spatial spillover effect of the water supply and demand, energy consumption, the proportion of protected areas and the newly increased areas of soil erosion control are significant and will have a strong impact on the water resource carrying capacity of surrounding areas. The conclusion of this paper can provide a reference for the government in making water resource management policies.

AB Geometric characteristics and Manning's roughness coefficient (n) are needed in steady and unsteady flow analysis in open channels and rivers. Various methods are used to estimate n of a river reach while there is always some uncertainty in its estimation. One of the methods for estimating n is its calibration using observed inflow and outflow hydrographs in a river reach. This calibration procedure is conducted by adjusting n such that the outflow hydrograph calculated by an adopted flow routing model matches the observed outflow hydrograph. The available calibration methods usually consider a uniform roughness along the reach of a river. In this study, a new method for calibration of n is presented that can recognize different regions with different n in a river reach even when only one recorded inflow and corresponding outflow hydrographs are available. In the proposed method, at first different cases are generated where, in each case, the river reach is divided into several sub-reaches in a systematic procedure. Then for each case, the n of all sub-reaches are optimized by using the Monte Carlo method and random search optimization. In the next step, the best case among all cases is identified by applying similarity criteria defined in this study. Finally, a clustering method is employed to identify different regions with different n values for the selected best case. The method was applied to some synthetic data and also Tiber river data and showed promising results.

AB Karst features in limestone aquifers often exhibit highly heterogeneous patterns, which are strongly governed by structural complexities such as the spatial distribution and organization of fractures in natural carbonate rocks. However, until now, little is known about the impact of structural complexity on karstification processes. In this paper, we use numerical models to investigate how structural heterogeneity affects the generation of incipient karst in natural fractured systems. We develop a numerical model which couples the processes of fluid flow, mass transport and dissolution kinetics that govern the growth of fracture aperture, based on discrete fracture networks. We apply the model to simulate conduit evolution in a natural joint network that displays a distinctive topological pattern. A wide range of hydraulic gradient and initial fracture aperture is considered. Our results show that the network topology may generate a significant impact on dissolution pattern depending on how flow is organized within the discrete network. If a channelized structure occurs in the flow network, the dissolution pattern depends highly on the initial hydrogeological settings, while if the flow network consists of branched segments, a similar dissolution pattern emerges for a broad range of initial hydrogeological settings. When the flow direction is normal to the persisting fracture orientation, intermittent interruptions to the positive feedback process between flow and dissolution occur. Therefore, the breakthrough is delayed. We discuss the link between our results of dissolution modeling in fracture networks to previous modelling efforts in the context of single rough fractures and fracture network formed by orthogonal fracture sets.

AB River bathymetry, which is vital for accurate hydraulic modeling, is not readily available at large scales because of the logistical difficulties in field surveys and uncertainties associated with remote sensing techniques. Several studies have explored the potential of conceptual models and interpolation algorithms to estimate bathymetry. These models have certain underlying assumptions that limit their accuracy and widespread implementation. This study aims to provide insights into the choice of bathymetric model for different hydraulic applications by analyzing the effect of different bathymetric models on hydraulic modeling under different geomorphologic and flow settings. This study does not aim to reinforce the importance of bathymetry, rather its objective is to identify the bathymetric properties that are critical to accurate estimation of different hydraulic outputs. The study accomplishes its objectives by implementing three different bathymetric models with varying cost and efficiency at four sites with diverse bathymetric characteristics. Five hydraulic outputs, namely wetted cross-sectional area, water surface elevation, inundation extents, velocity and shear are estimated at three characteristic low and high flows and the results from the four sites are grouped together to perform an unbiased and robust evaluation. The performance of these models is evaluated using the best available bathymetric representation generated from detailed field surveys as a benchmark. The results indicate that 1D flood modeling is somewhat insensitive to channel shape as long as the estimated shape reflects the channel storage accurately. Velocity and shear related applications should incorporate bathymetry that represent both the cross-sectional area and channel thalweg accurately. Reaches with low sinuosity (< 1.5), or small width and depth can be modeled reasonably using simple geometric shapes, whereas for larger streams, interpolation of surveyed data along the thalweg or complex bathymetric models that account for river anisotropy, are recommended.

AB Here, we propose a new alternative machine learning method that combines the advantage of the Random Vector Functional Link Network (RVFL) with Moth Search Algorithm (MSA) to predict the missing values of total algal count during water quality monitoring of surface waters that providing drinking water treatment plants in Fayoum, Egypt. Total of 34 water quality parameters was measured in 270 water samples during the period 2015-2017. The MSA algorithm was used for optimal selection of input features to improve the performance of the RVFL. The predicted missing values of the total algal count, by the proposed MSA-RVFL method, were strongly correlated with the real observed ones. The results of the MSA-RVFL were better than the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) models at different sizes of training tests. Compared with GA-RVFL and PSO-RVFL methods, using the MSA-RVFL was relevant to minimize the input variables and to reduce the processing time. The MSA-RVFL model could reduce the number of input variables from thirty-four to eighteen and eventually to four variables. The most significant variables selected by the MSA-RVFL to predict the total algal count were pH, NO3, P and Ca. Based on these four variables, the predicted values of algae were significantly matching with the real observations (R-2 = 0.9594). Accordingly, this makes the MSA-RVFL model to be a useful cost-efficient tool during water quality monitoring programs. Finally, the MSA-RVFL showed higher performance whenever the number of inputs is large or small that gives our suggested method more advantages than the traditional ANN models.

AB Flooding is a very common natural hazard that causes catastrophic effects worldwide. Recently, ensemble-based techniques have become popular in flood susceptibility modelling due to their greater strength and efficiency in the prediction of flood locations. Thus, the aim of this study was to employ machine learning-based Reduced-error pruning trees (REPTree) with Bagging (Bag-REPTree) and Random subspace (RS-REPTree) ensemble frameworks for spatial prediction of flood susceptibility using a geographic information system (GIS). First, a flood spatial database was constructed with 363 flood locations and thirteen flood influencing factors, namely altitude, slope angle, slope aspect, curvature, stream power index (SPI), sediment transport index (STI), topographic wetness index (TWI), distance to rivers, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil, land use, lithology, and rainfall. Subsequently, correlation attribute evaluation (CAE) was used as the factor selection method for optimization of input factors. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, standard error (SE), confidence interval (CI) at 95%, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to validate and compare the performance of the models. Results show that the RS-REPTree model has the highest prediction capability for flood susceptibility assessment, with the highest area under (the ROC) curve (AUC) value (0.949, 0.907), the smallest SE (0.011, 0.023), and the narrowest CI (95%) (0.928-0.970, 0.863-0.952) for the training and validation datasets. It was followed by the Bag-REPTree and REPTree models, respectively. The results also proved the superiority of the ensemble method over using these methods individually.

AB Poljes are large flat closed depressions that can be found in most karst areas around the world. They are prone to regular flooding, which occurs after abundant rainfall or snowmelt events. The floods can form several meters deep intermittent lakes that can persist for months. Human settlements around poljes have been traditionally positioned above the level of the most severe floods. However, many neighbouring villages expanded during the last decades to areas that might be endangered by large flood events. In addition, a recent study has shown that several poljes encountered floods of more severe amplitude in mid-Holocene due to a prevailing humid climate. As current knowledge of polje's hydrology appears to be still insufficient, further research is needed. This work aims to identify the factors controlling polje flooding and evaluates their impact on the flood amplitude and duration. To do so, a list of parameters potentially controlling flooding is established. The relevance of each parameter is tested by using two idealized numerical models. The first one considers exclusively the polje from the springs to the ponors, whereas the second integrates the aquifer adjacent to the polje outflow side. First results show the usefulness of simple numerical models to identify the effect of each parameter on the flood amplitude and duration. The findings are combined to simulate a flood of medium intensity and long duration that occurred on a typical polje. A comparison of the results with real data demonstrates that the aquifer draining the polje needs to be considered to understand properly the flooding dynamics. The approach presented within this work has the potential to be used in other poljes encountering similar hydrological situations, but also lays foundation for flooding modelling in other karst areas.

AB As a non-structural river basin management option, development of a reliable inflow forecasting system using the hydrological models is essential to aid in real-time reservoir operation. For real-time streamflow forecasting, this study evaluates the capability of the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) in integration with the linear AutoRegressive (ARu), AutoRegressive Moving Average with eXogenous inputs (ARMAXu), nonlinear static wavelet-based neural network (WNNu), and dynamic wavelet-based Non-linear AutoregRessive with eXogenous inputs (WNARXu) variants of error-correction sub-models in comparison with the predictions by the standalone VIC model forced with European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) and ERA-Interim reanalysis products. These VIC-standalone, VIC-ARu, VIC-ARMAXu, VIC-WNNu, and VIC-WNARXu frameworks are field-tested for 1- to 5-days lead-time streamflow forecasting in the Hirakud reservoir catchment of the Mahanadi River basin in eastern India. The performance evaluation measures and quantile regression (QR)-based predictive uncertainty (PU) analysis reveal that the VIC-WNARXu model is the best approach for short to medium range flood forecasting with up to 7 days lead-time having the potential to be used in other world-river basins as a component of the early flood warning system.

AB Recently accrued attention has been given to machine learning approaches for flooding prediction. However, most of these studies focused mainly on time-series flooding prediction at specified sensors, rarely on spatio-temporal prediction of inundations. In this work, an integrated long short-term memory (LSTM) and reduced order model (ROM) framework has been developed. This integrated LSTM-ROM has the capability of representing the spatio-temporal distribution of floods since it takes advantage of both ROM and LSTM. To reduce the dimensional size of large spatial datasets in LSTM, the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and singular value decomposition (SVD) approaches are introduced. The LSTM training and prediction processes are carried out over the reduced space. This leads to an improvement of computational efficiency while maintaining the accuracy. The performance of the LSTM-ROM developed here has been evaluated using Okushiri tsunami as test cases. The results obtained from the LSTM-ROM have been compared with those from the full model (Fluidity). In predictive analytics, it is shown that the results from both the full model and LSTM-ROM are in a good agreement whilst the CPU cost using the LSTM-ROM is decreased by three orders of magnitude compared to full model simulations. Additionally, prescriptive analytics has been undertaken to estimate the uncertainty in flood induced conditions. Given the time series of the free surface height at a specified detector, the corresponding induced wave conditions along the coastline have then been provided using the LSTM network. Promising results indicate that the use of LSTM-ROM can provide the flood prediction in seconds, enabling us to provide real-time predictions and inform the public in a timely manner, reducing injuries and fatalities.

AB Precise estimation of flow conveyance in a two-stage open channel with vegetated floodplains is a key prerequisite to the management of the river ecosystem and the creation of flood retention space. The presence of vegetation alters the structure of water flow and affects the discharge in a two-stage channel. Nevertheless, the effect of vegetation on flow conveyance is not studied separately in the previous flow discharge research. By conducting force analysis in a control volume with considering the vegetation drag force and quantifying the energy loss caused by vegetation blocking effect and the transverse velocity gradient, this paper proposes a new method to estimate flow conveyance in compound channel covered with vegetation based on the relationship which is the total energy loss is balanced by the total energy supplied by the local flow. Experimental data series are collected to verify the new method by comparing the measured and estimated discharges and it presents a good accuracy with 2.47% relative error. The new method is also compared with the other methods, which quantify the additional resistance of vegetation by using the equivalent Manning's roughness coefficient. The results indicate that both the vegetation drag force and the equivalent Manning's roughness coefficient can be used in flow conveyance estimation and dominantly influence the accuracy of the predictive method so that they need to be properly quantified and calibrated. And adopting the vegetation drag force is suggested here for the simplicity of calculation.

AB Soil hydraulic properties are frequently obtained from evaporation experiments. Different methods exist to infer soil hydraulic properties from these experiments. Commonly proposed is the 'direct method' (or 'Simplified Evaporation Method') by which soil hydraulic properties are calculated analytically. An alternative is given by inverse parameter optimization (Inverse method'). Although soil hydraulic properties are frequently estimated by the 'direct method', only very few studies have focused on the question how accurate derived parameters can reproduce laboratory measurements. This can be achieved by modeling the water flow with a processed based numerical forward model, e.g. with HYDRUS-1D. Here, we applied the 'direct method' and 'inverse method' to a large dataset of evaporation experiments on 431 organic soil samples. The derived soil hydraulic parameters were used in HYDRUS-1D simulations and their performance in reproducing measured states and fluxes was compared. As an additional analysis, we tested how water contents at the permanent wilting point can aid stabilizing parameter estimation by adding information on water retention in the dry range. For all methods, soil hydraulic properties were determined with the soil hydraulic functions of van Genuchten-Mualem and Peters-Dumer-Iden.
   The results show that parameters derived with the 'direct method' do often not well reproduce measured pressure heads over the complete pressure head range of the evaporation experiments when they were used for HYDRUS-1D simulations (mean objective function value 0.05831). Parameters derived by the 'inverse method' provided a better performance in the HYDRUS-1D simulations if the full pressure head range of the evaporation experiments was considered (mean objective function value 0.00099), but a weaker performance when focusing on wet conditions (pressure heads > - 100 cm). Constraining the 'inverse method' by additional soil moisture measurements at permanent wilting point improved the prediction of the soil moisture at dry conditions. For the full pressure head range, the hydraulic functions of Peters-Durner-Iden performed better than the ones of van Genuchten-Mualem.

AB In order to deepen our understanding of water environment-related issues in the central Tianshan Mountains (TCTMs), it is necessary to study the change processes of hydrological variables and the underlying mechanisms within a longer time window that goes beyond the instrumental period. This study focuses on a high-resolution lacustrine sediment core drilled from an alpine lake in TCTMs with a hope that palaeohydrological changes inferred from diatom assemblages may provide an insight on details of water environment evolutions. The diatom inferred temperature was broadly consistent with the temperature records in its adjacent areas, representing a temperature trough during similar to 1490 to similar to 1835 CE and a general rising trend since similar to 1835 CE. The diatom inferred pH (DI-pH) was generally low during similar to 1490 to similar to 1835 CE, and was high with a declined trend during similar to 1835 to similar to 2013 CE, being negatively correlated with TN or TOC and positively correlated with carbonate in sediments significantly. The diatom inferred conductivity (DI-Cond) was characterized with a significantly high salinity interval during similar to 1490 to similar to 1835 CE than that during similar to 1835 to similar to 2013 CE. The salinity during the past similar to 520 years was modulated by interplays among precipitation driven by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillations, temperature-dictated evaporation, and temperature-led glacier melting. The water environment changes (lakewater temperature, DI-pH, DI-Cond and diatom assemblages) were identified with a remarkable shift at similar to 1835 CE when the temperature began to climb up in TCTMs, implying that climate warming not only exerted influences on water resources but also on water properties in TCTMs.

AB Complex interactions among organic contaminant, soil and water change the electrical properties of the subsurface often causing strong self-potential (SP) anomalies, whose monitoring is proposed as a useful tool to determine the temporal evolution of the contaminant plumes. In the present study, we focus on the problem of organic contaminant transport related to olive oil mill wastes (OOMWs), which represent an important environmental problem in Mediterranean countries. The diffusion of the contaminants into the subsurface is studied by using a global optimization procedure on SP data measured, at different times, in a well-studied contaminated pilot area located next to the Keritis river in western Crete island (Greece). Despite the complex hydrogeological conditions related to the proximity to both the Keritis river and a small seasonal stream, the analysis of five SP datasets acquired along the same profile shows that the proposed hybrid Genetic-Price algorithm is able to reproduce the main features of the SP signals, thus identifying probable multiple SP anomaly sources and their changes over time. In particular, preferential horizontal pathways of OOMW and their migration in the vadose zone during the summer season were identified, providing some useful insights for future planning of remediation actions.

AB In an alluvial river, various kinds of river regulation engineering are usually constructed along the reach for the stability of channel regime and the safety of flood control, which greatly affects the process of channel evolution. Therefore, a one-dimensional (1D) morphodynamic model has been improved to simulate the fluvial processes influenced by large-scale river regulation works. In the refined model, each node of a cross-section was labeled using a specified point code representing the zones of floodplain and main-channel with or without regulation engineering, and sediment transport and bed deformation in different zones were treated separately. In the zones without regulation engineering, both bed deposition and bed erosion were permitted to occur; in the zones with regulation works, bed deposition was allowed, while bed erosion was not permitted to occur owing to the restriction of those engineering, unless there was a deposition layer newly formed over the previous simulation period. Then the improved model was calibrated and verified using field observations through the application to a 347-km-long alluvial channel located in the Middle Yangtze River in China. The results for the year 2016 show that the channel scour volume without the effect of river regulation works was 9% greater than the measured value (34.43 x 10(6) t), while the outcome considering this effect (35.81 x 10(6) t) was in closer agreement with the measurements. Moreover, the variation in channel geometry obtained from the improved model agreed better with the observed data. River regulation works would limit the channel incision, and it is likely to scour the other unprotected bed of a cross-section or the downstream cross-sections as the flow cannot carry enough sediment from the protected bed. Simulated results indicate that part of the main-channel zone at the Jing65 section was protected, but the riverbed continued to incise by about 0.68 m in the protected area when the effect of bed-protection works was not considered in the model, which was not in accord with the observed channel geometry. Therefore, this effect of large-scale river regulation works on channel evolution needs to be considered for a higher simulation accuracy.

AB Evaluation of calculation models for the unfrozen water content of freezing soil is very important for numerical simulations. Based on the published 250 laboratory data and around 5 years field observed data, this paper evaluated the five widely used unfrozen water content models, i.e., the Zhang et al. (2017a) model, the Anderson and Tice (1972) model, the Michalowski (1993) model, the Mckenzie et al. (2007) model, and the Kozlowski (2007) model. The results show that the five models can all be used to calculate the unfrozen water content of laboratory soil samples. The Anderson and Tice (1972) model, the Michalowski (1993) model, and the Kozlowski (2007) model are descripted by gravimetric unfrozen water content. However, it is difficult to directly measure the gravimetric unfrozen water content during the freezing process. The Mckenzie et al. (2007) model and the Zhang et al. (2017a) model are descripted by volumetric unfrozen water content which can be directly measured during the freezing process. Besides, the parameters of the Zhang et al. (2017a) model are relatively simple, although the model slightly overestimates the volumetric unfrozen water content for some laboratory soils. Therefore, the Zhang et al. (2017a) model is more convenient for numerical simulations. Furthermore, all the models have great potential to calculate unfrozen water content of freezing soils in field observations. This paper would provide significant reference for the selection of unfrozen water content models in the description of hydro-thermo coupling process in cold regions.

AB The coastal zone is not only a terrestrial-marine buffer system but also the main site of the organic matter decomposition process, which complicates the identification of the sources of bioactive elements (C, N and S) and the factors that control C-N-S cycling. Here, a multi-isotope approach is developed to distinguish C, N and S sources and the associated geochemical processes in a coastal aquifer system of the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China. The PRD is characterized as a typical multilayer groundwater system with a reducing environment in the confined aquifers and an oxidizing environment in the unconfined aquifer. For the groundwater samples from the unconfined aquifer, the delta N-15 values showed that the ammonium and nitrate originated from manure and sewage, the delta C-13-DIC indicated that dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) was mainly derived from soil CO2 and weathering of carbonate rocks, and the delta S-34 and delta O-18 signals of sulfate suggested that SO42- originated from the dissolution of continental evaporate. The oxidizing environment and the positive relationship between delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- suggested that nitrification and de nitrification were the key factors influencing the transformation of nitrogen in the unconfined aquifer. No obvious correlation between C, N and S content and isotopic composition suggested C-N-S was loosely coupled in this aquifer.
   For the groundwater samples in the confined aquifers, the delta D-H2O and delta O-18-H2O signals suggested that partially confined groundwater samples were affected by seawater intrusion. In the non-seawater intrusion region (NSI zone), the C, N and S content combined with C, N and S isotopic composition indicated that ammonium was derived from the mineralization of organic matter, sulfate mainly originated from rock weathering, and DIC mainly originated from carbonate mineral dissolution and the CO2 produced by organic matter mineralization. Extremely high CH4 concentrations suggested the existence of methanogenesis, while the molar ratio of CH4/(CH4 + (1 + alpha) x CO2) indicated that both acetate fermentation and CO2 reduction were ubiquitous. CO2 reduction had a stronger isotopic fractionation effect on the delta C-13-DIC values, thus, the relatively high delta C-13-DIC values were observed. The electron acceptor was the key factor for organic matter mineralization, and CO2 acted as the main electron acceptor in the NSI Zone. Accordingly, acetate fermentation and CO2 reduction became the key factors driving ammonium release in the NSI zone. In the seawater intrusion region (SI zone), ammonium was derived from the mineralization of organic matter, sulfate was derived from the mixing of fresh water and seawater, and DIC was derived from carbonate mineral dissolution, seawater and the CO2 produced by organic matter mineralization. The delta S-34-SO42- showed a positive correlation with delta O-18-SO42- and a negative correlation with SO42-, suggesting the existence of bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR). High CH4 concentrations also suggested the existence of methanogenesis. The CH4/(CH4 + (1 + alpha) x CO2) ratios indicated that CO2 reduction existed in more than half of the confined groundwater samples in the SI zone. C-N-S was highly coupled in this region because both BSR and methanogenesis can increase the DIC content, while BSR enriches lighter carbon isotopes and methanogenesis enriches heavier carbon isotopes; thus, a wide range of delta C-13-DIC values was found in SI zone. Sulfate or both sulfate and CO2 were the electron acceptors. Accordingly, acetate fermentation, sulfur reduction and CO2 reduction worked together to promote ammonium release for the groundwater samples in the SI Zone. However, the exhaustion of sulfate will make CO2 reduction the key factor for organic matter mineralization in the future.

AB The intensification of the hydrologic cycle due to climate change is likely to influence the extreme precipitation characteristics (i.e., intensity, duration and frequency). These precipitation characteristics are integrated to construct Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves that are widely used to design civil infrastructure systems. These IDF curves are typically derived based on the stationary assumption, however, the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events likely to become nonstationary as a consequence of climate change. During the past decades, unusual extreme precipitation events with more than thousand-year return periods were recorded in the United States. This study investigates the nonstationary nature of the most recent extreme precipitation events occurred over different durations (1-, 3- and 5-days) by incorporating time-varying covariates, such as time, maximum temperature, mean temperature, and the El Nino Southern Oscillation cycle (ENSO). The nonstationary frequency analysis for these extreme events was conducted using nonstationary Generalized Extreme Value distribution by incorporating the time-varying covariates. It was observed that most of the temporal evolution of extreme precipitation events follow the nonstationary pattern, which may be due to the increase in the magnitude of recent extreme precipitation events, especially during hurricane events. Different combination of covariates can potentially influence the nonstationary frequency analysis, and the type of covariate may differ when the accumulated period of extreme precipitation event increased. Based on the Nonstationary Extreme Value Analysis, the return periods associated with extreme precipitation events significantly reduced compared to the stationary approach.

AB Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) is a singular parameter in earth system science. K-s not only governs the rate of flow of water under a hydraulic gradient as specified by the Darcy equation for saturated conditions, but also acts as a scaling factor in many unsaturated flow and transport applications that involve pore-size distribution models. Without knowledge of saturated hydraulic conductivity, it would be difficult to accurately describe the transport of water and dissolved or suspended constituents in soils and sediments, or calculate groundwater transport and recharge, and quantify the exchange between soils and the atmosphere. While the determination of K-s is not especially difficult, it is expensive and (in many cases) infeasible to carry out field or lab experiments for large-scale applications. Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) are a class of largely data-driven empirical models that aim to estimate K-s (and often other hydraulic quantities such as water retention characteristics) from easily available data. In this review, we first briefly discuss the history of the development of the concept of saturated hydraulic conductivity and its relation to the Kozeny-Carman (KC) equation. The KC equation serves as a central point in this review because it determines which soil variables affect saturated flow at the pore-scale, a domain which now can also be visited by computational fluid dynamics models. The KC equation also provides us with a structure in which we can classify the large number of PTFs that have been developed for estimating K-s. Datasets and statistical techniques available for PTF development are discussed, and we also describe common metrics used to assess the accuracy and reliability of PTF estimates. The mutual agreement of two main classes (i.e., an effective porosity KC-based and soil texture-based) of PTFs is analyzed using a number of global maps of predicted K-s. Finally, we discuss challenges and perspectives that might lead to PTFs with improved estimates of K-s. In particular, we suggest establishing and utilizing large and completely independent databases to assess the accuracy and reliability of PTFs for global use, while also drawing in information from pedological and remote sensing sources.

   FRAMEWORK
AB Inaccurate description of uncertainty in the error models can cause biases in parameter estimation. When the parameters of the deterministic model and the error model are inferred jointly from the observations, the posterior converges to regions that reflect the processes in both high and low flows. If the nature of errors in low and high flows is different to the extent that the same error description cannot be used for both, biases in inference are introduced. In such cases, the parameter posterior will adjust to the region of the hydrograph with longer proportionate presence in the calibration time series. In this paper we demonstrate that the autoregressive order 1 (AR1) description of errors can lead to sub-optimally performing predictive models if the calibration period has substantial sections of inadequately modelled flows. Inference is performed within the Bayesian framework. We show this for a synthetic example as well as a case study. We also see that the predictive uncertainty bands that we get using the AR1 description can be overconfident and also admit negative values. To mitigate this, we analyze an alternative to additive error models. We use a distribution with a non-negative support, gamma in this study, reflecting the uncertainty in the system response at every time step. The gamma distribution is conditioned on the deterministic model output, which determines its mode and standard deviation. We capture autocorrelation in time using copulas. Given that copulas can capture dependence between different marginals, we use different specifications of the marginal distribution for high and low flows. The results show that 1) biases in parameter estimation can be reduced if a representative error description is attained using the flexibility of a copula-based likelihood. 2) The non-negative support allows to make more realistic uncertainty intervals for low flows. 3) However, the autocorrelation parameter in copulas severely interacts with the model and heteroscedasticity parameters. 4) While the formulation, in principle, should be of added value for parameter inference, in case of less informative priors, the flexibility of this description can produce non-robust inference.

AB Forests are important components of the terrestrial ecosystem that play major roles in carbon cycling and associated environmental changes, but more knowledge of the processes involved is required. Therefore, carbon wet deposition and rainfall-runoff processes were examined, as well as carbon fluxes and sources in water in the Xiangxi River watershed, a typical subtropical forested watershed in China. Wet deposition of carbon amounted to 1.31 x 10(4) kg km(-2) between June 2015 and May 2016 (inclusive). The concentration of measured forms of carbon in rainwater of single rainfall event peaked in summer, when the concentration of dissolved total carbon (DTC) was 16.5 mg L-1. In 2016, rainfall-runoff amounted to 7440 kg km(-2), accounting for about 57% of the carbon wet deposition in the watershed. The forest ecosystem in the watershed was found to be a carbon sink every month of the year, with net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) in 2016 of -5.11 x 10(5) kg C km(-2), and monthly NEE was lowest in July (- 8.93 x 10(4) kg C km(-2)). The C-13/C-12 ratio in dissolved inorganic carbon in the river water, relative to Pee Dee Belemnite (delta C-13(DIC)), was higher in the dry season (range, -12.00 to -9.70 parts per thousand; mean, -11.0 parts per thousand) than in the rainy season (range, -14.00 to -12.20 parts per thousand; mean, -12.90 parts per thousand), and higher in downstream reaches (mean values in winter and spring: -10.45 and -12.35 parts per thousand, respectively) than in upstream and middle reaches (-10.63 and -13.30 parts per thousand, -11.63 and -12.87 parts per thousand). In addition, atmospheric precipitation made the highest contributions to the C concentration in the river water in spring and winter (48.6 and 43.2%, respectively).

AB As the only unnatural phenomenon among the four drought types, socioeconomic drought exerts direct negative impacts on socioeconomic system. Socioeconomic drought is closely related to regional sustainable development, which however is received the least attention. Therefore, this study aims to construct a practical framework to fully assess socioeconomic drought dynamic risk. Based on an improved Multivariate Standardized Reliability and Resilience Index (IMSRRI) and copulas function, the joint return periods of different grades drought were calculated to assess the drought risk from a macro perspective, while three drought risk indicators (resilience, vulnerability, and exposure) were adopted for drought risk assessment from a micro perspective. In addition, a 30-year sliding window was applied on the IMSRRI series to explore the dynamic drought risk in a changing environment. Furthermore, the linkages between drought risk indicators and teleconnection factors (Arctic Oscillation (AO), El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)) were explored. The upper Yellow River Basin (UYRB) was selected as a case study, and the study period is from 1959 to 2010. Results indicate that: (1) the 'boolean AND' joint return periods of the moderate, severe and extreme drought in the UYRB were 5.03, 11.7, and 40.78 years, respectively, and the resilience, vulnerability and exposure values of socioeconomic drought were 0.11, 14.38, and 0.37, respectively; (2) the year of 1995 was the turning point of socioeconomic drought risk (before 1995, socio-economic drought risk was decreasing, after 1995, socioeconomic drought risk was increasing), which corresponds well to that of the IMSRRI series; and (3) socioeconomic drought risk is significantly associated with teleconnection factors, with the descending correlation order of PDO > ENSO > AO. This study sheds new insights into socioeconomic drought dynamic risk assessment in a changing environment.

AB As one of the most important agricultural bases in China, the North China Plain (NCP) has experienced serious groundwater depletion. However, estimates of groundwater depletion rates in NCP differ considerably from one another due to different datasets and methods used in the estimation. To get a better estimate of the groundwater depletion and to reveal the recent groundwater changes in NCP, we first merge Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mass concentration (mascon) solutions from different organizations and soil moisture from different land surface models to yield unified mascon solutions and soil moisture estimates. We then estimate the groundwater changes by subtracting the unified soil moisture and surface water storages in the major reservoirs in NCP from the unified mascon solutions. Results show that the groundwater storage in NCP depleted at a rate of 1.7 +/- 0.1 cm/yr from 2004 to mid-2016 but this depletion accelerated to 3.8 +/- 0.1 cm/yr from mid-2013 to mid-2016. Ground-based water table data show a consistent groundwater depletion rate (-3.9 +/- 0.3 cm/yr from mid-2013 to mid-2016) with the GRACE results. We also analyze the land subsidence in NCP by using 116 Global Positioning System (GPS) sites and depict the accelerated land subsidence and expanded subsidence funnels since 2013, which is consistent with the groundwater depletion. All these point to a strong acceleration in groundwater depletion in NCP since mid-2013. Land surface model outputs suggest a precipitation decline from 2013 to 2016, which caused a decline in soil moisture content and surface water storage. This drought forced people to exploit more groundwater to compensate the surface water shortage and thereby led to the accelerated groundwater depletion.

AB The use of hydrologic models to assess long-term watershed condition through repeated simulations of runoff and erosion is one common approach for rangeland health evaluation. However, obtaining vegetative data of appropriate spatiotemporal resolution for model parameterization can be difficult. The goal of this research was to assess the utility of using time-varying, Landsat-derived vegetative values to parameterize an event-based, watershed-scale hydrologic model. This study was conducted on a small, instrumented grassland watershed in the USDA Agricultural Research Service operated Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed in southeastern, Arizona. Cloud-free Landsat scenes were acquired over the watershed for the years 1996-2014. The Soil Adjusted Total Vegetation Index (SATVI) was calculated for each image and calibrated using ground measured data to produce a time series of satellite-based foliar cover rasters. These values were used to parameterize the Rangeland Hydrology and Erosion Model (RHEM) for 26 rainfall-runoff events with corresponding observed data. Three parameterization scenarios using these data aggregated to different temporal resolutions (static, long-term mean, annual mean, and intra-annual values) were compared to a static literature-based scenario for evaluation. The linear relationship between field-measured foliar cover and SATVI showed statistically significant agreement with R-2 = 0.85 and p < 0.05. Simulated runoff volume and peak flow rate using the three remotely sensed parameterization scenarios improved upon that of the literature-based scenario, with the annual mean scenario performing the best of the three temporal aggregations. The methodological framework outlined here provides a means for improved parameterization for watershed-scale modelling where vegetative data may be scarce or unobtainable for long-term analysis.

AB Spatial planning in areas where underground mineral resources occur requires specific and sound environmental policies. Spatial policy should be based on proper identification and planning of sustainable development policies in a manner compatible with legally defined mining transformations. Depending on the initial morphology of the mine subsidence area, mining can lead to the transformation of the aquatic environment, including the occurrence of floods (inundated lands), water-logging, surface drying and/or the threat of flooding. This concerns artificially drained mining and post-mining areas and may result from the restoration of free water flows (turning off pumping stations). This article refers specifically to the permanent flooding and/or threat of flooding of parts of mine subsidence areas. In active mine subsidence areas of hard coal mines the surface relief is permanently subsided. For this reason, the identified flood hazards only have short-term relevance. Special hydromorphological elements of the environment of artificially drained mine subsidence areas, first formulated by the author, can set new standards of quality in environmental policies. The paper contains a description of the most important of these: the base of natural outflow of water, the normal hydrometric reference point the relative elevations of the surface of the mine subsidence areas and the boundary of potential backwater. The introduction of relative elevations of the surface above the hydrometric reference point makes possible purpose -prepared spatial mapping of the mine subsidence area's relief used to assess the threat of flooding. The novel elements have a range of applications, including flood insurance, flood risk management, water management, remediation of mining damage, and sustainable spatial planning. Additionally, the method allows the qualification of existing and recoverable mineral resources for economic usability taking into account the needs of sustainable planning as well as responsible mining techniques.

AB The identification of factors affecting the first flush phenomenon is important for the control of urban nonpoint source pollution. This study developed machine learning algorithms, the regression tree (RT) and random forest (RF) algorithms, to predict the mass first flush ratio (MFFn) from seven rainfall-related variables. We also evaluated the prediction performance of the two algorithms and the relative importance of the seven variables in model prediction. The RF algorithm outperformed the RT algorithm in terms of Akaike information criterion (AIC) values. In general, the target variables simulated using the RF algorithm had lower AIC values than did those of the RT algorithm, except for T-N and T-P. The RF algorithm also provided acceptable performance statistics for the MFF10 to MFF20 of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) (R-2 = 0.71 and 0.67; Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) = 0.67 and 0.52), chemical oxygen demand (COD) (R-2 = 0.70 and 0.71; NSE = 0.66 and 0.62), total organic carbon (TOC) (R-2 = 0.70 and 0.63; NSE = 0.56 and 0.57), and total phosphorus (T-P) (R-2 = 0.72 and 0.71; NSE = 0.68 and 0.58). Suspended solids (SS) predicted by the RF algorithm showed an acceptable value for R-2 (0.68 and 0.64) but a low NSE for the MFF20 (NSE = 0.48). However, the prediction of MFF30 was unacceptable for all target variables. The rainfall-related variables showed different relative importance estimates among the water quality parameters in the MFFn prediction. Results also showed that SOD and COD were closely associated with rainfall intensity (RI). TOC and T-P showed strong relationships with RI and antecedent rainfall (AR). SS was closely related to RI and rainfall duration (R-dur). T-N showed strong relationships with R-dur, respectively. This study demonstrated that the RF algorithm could be a useful tool to predict the MFF10 and MFF20 of BOD, COD, TOC, and T-P on the basis of rainfall characteristics in urban catchments.

AB Rapid urbanization in metropolitan areas easily triggers flashy floods. Urban drainage systems conveying stormwater out of cities are key infrastructure elements for flood mitigation. This study develops an intelligent urban flood drainage system accounting for carryover storage through optimizing the multi-objective operation rules of pumping stations for effectual flood management in Taipei City. The Yu-Cheng pumping station constitutes the study case, and a large number of datasets collected from 17 typhoon/storm events are adopted for model construction and validation. Three objective functions are designed to minimize: (1) the sum of water level fluctuations in the flood storage pond (FSP); (2) the sum of peak FSP water levels; and (3) the mean absolute difference of pump switches between two consecutive times along operation sequence. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm H (NSGA-II) is applied to searching the Pareto-optimal solutions that optimize the trade-off between the objectives. We next formulate the optimal operation rules through a two-tier sorting process based on a compromised Pareto-optimal solution. The comparison of the simulated results obtained from both the optimal operation rules and current operation rules indicate that the optimal operation rules outperform current operation rules for all three objectives, with improvement rates reaching 43% (OBJ1), 3% (OBJ2) and 71% (OBJ3), respectively. We demonstrate that the derived intelligent urban flood drainage system can serve as reliable and efficient operational strategies for urban flood management and flood risk mitigation.

AB The Green-Ampt (GA) model, which assumes a rectangular saturated piston flow and homogeneous isotropic soil with uniform initial water content, is one of the most widely used models for describing infiltration processes. However, these assumptions severely limit the applications of the model. Thus, a modified GA model has long been a topic of interest. This study mainly investigates the effects of the broken-line wetting profile and dynamic capillary pressure on the GA model of a horizontal soil column. The aim is to provide a reasonable correction term for the hydraulic conductivity and suction head. The correction term is considered to be 0.4 when the dynamic capillary pressure (CGA model) is neglected. When the dynamic capillary pressure is taken into account, the correction term is a special function (FGA model). Moreover, the results of the CGA model, FGA model, Richards equation, and Mao model are compared with respect to the measured data for sandy loam, silt loam, and silty clay loam. Richards equation cannot accurately describe the infiltration of water into silt loam, and part of the reason is the high infiltration velocity. Although the Mao model can perfectly simulate the infiltration process in a short time (approximately 50 min in this study), its results gradually deviate from the actual situation after 50 min. The CGA model can predict the entire infiltration processes relatively accurately except in the dry sand with zero water content. However, as in the traditional GA model, small errors can still occur during the early infiltration stage. The FGA model is considered to be the most suitable approach for describing infiltration processes. In this paper, the characteristics of these models are explained, and the parameters of the FGA model are discussed in detail.

AB Freshwater lenses present valuable water resources on barrier islands. Yet, the biogeochemical processes that control the groundwater quality of these freshwater lenses and how they are affected by the prevailing groundwater dynamics is largely unexplored. In this study we investigated the biogeochemistry of a barrier island freshwater lens with a focus on understanding and quantifying organic matter mineralization, sulfur cycling, and chemical fluxes to the land-ocean interface. We analyzed a comprehensive set of hydrogeochemical field data from Spiekeroog Island (Germany), including stable sulfur isotope signatures of dissolved sulfur species, with a reactive transport modeling approach. Tritium-Helium groundwater ages were used to constrain the hydrogeochemistry as a function of residence time. Our results revealed that freshwater lenses can act as archives for anthropogenic pollution, conserving the high sulfur loads associated with historic atmospheric deposition. We observed two distinct (hydro)biogeochemical patterns, which we attribute to a heterogeneous distribution of reactive organic matter. Those patterns were well replicated by two separate reactive transport models that considered the variations in organic matter reactivity. Simulation and field results demonstrated that net sulfur cycling is dominated by microbial sulfate reduction and subsequent iron sulfide precipitation. In the absence of dissolved oxidants, we attribute the observed high stable sulfur isotope fractionation between dissolved sulfate and sulfide of up to 67 parts per thousand to low (< 20 pmol mL(-1) d(-1)) microbial sulfate reduction rates. We show that older groundwater becomes progressively enriched in ammonium and phosphate due to the mineralization of organic matter, and we speculate that lens-derived nutrient fluxes may be important for the benthic zone at local groundwater discharge sites, at least seasonally in spring and summer.

AB The transient storage model (TSM) is a popular solute transport model among hydrologists and ecologists for characterizing solute retention potential of small headwater streams. TSM parameters are most commonly estimated in an inverse modeling framework using tracer breakthrough data. A key challenge in interpreting TSM parameters is the inherent difficulty in the estimation process and relating these parameters with the physical characteristics of streams. While often recognized that multiple sources of uncertainty impact transient storage modeling, rigorous evaluation of TSM parameter uncertainty is rare. Stream flow magnitude has been identified as a key variable in characterizing stream solute transport dynamics, yet no study has shown the impact of flow magnitude on TSM parameter uncertainty. In this paper we study the impact of flow magnitude on TSM parameter uncertainty by using tracer data from repeated tracer studies with changing stream flow magnitudes, and introduce a software tool to perform Markov chain Monte Carlo based parameter estimation and uncertainty evaluation. The software tool developed is capable of performing thousands of model runs within a few hours, which is necessary for Monte Carlo based parameter estimation, and provides a potentially attractive framework for model testing and improvement. TSM parameters were found to be relatively less important during higher flows with large uncertainty bounds and clear evidence of parameter correlations. The importance of TSM parameters on solute transport seemed to increase as flow decreased with seasonal baseflow recession. Our findings highlight the need for improved field methodologies to reduce parameter uncertainty and the need for further improvement in the model structure for successful stream characterization.

AB Modeling and mapping of floods using one (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) models has resulted in significant progress in our understanding of river hydraulics and hydrology. The existing modeling approach can be improved further through a better understanding of the interactions between river hydrodynamics and subsurface processes. Saturated conditions in subsurface and floodplains can lead to longer and deeper inundation from low intensity but continuous flood events. To understand the combined effect of surface-subsurface hydrology and hydrodynamics on streamflow generation and subsequent inundation during floods, this study uses an integrated surface water-groundwater (SW-GW) modeling approach for simulating flood conditions. Simulation of a high flooding event for the Upper Wabash River basin in Indiana, USA, shows that the river-floodplain hydrodynamics is simulated more accurately without the need for extensive calibration by using a two-dimensional integrated SW-GW model. Additionally, an integrated model provides a more realistic simulation of flood hydrodynamics for different antecedent soil conditions. Specifically, results show that the streamflow, flood stages and inundation area obtained for the dry scenario are significantly lower when compared to the saturated scenario. These findings are further validated by applying the integrated modeling approach for an entirely different watershed (Croton River) in the state of New York. Overall, the findings from this study suggest that the current practice of simulating floods which assumes an impervious surface may not be providing realistic estimates of flood inundation, and that an integrated approach incorporating all the hydrologic and hydraulic processes in the river system must be adopted.

AB Coastal wetlands are among the most productive and fluctuating ecosystems of the world. These ecosystems, however, are affected by human activities that may change their nutrient dynamics and water regime, causing the degradation of water quality, the disappearance of lagoons and wetlands, or the establishment of invasive species. In this context, the La Pletera salt marsh is composed of several coastal lagoons and wetlands that were affected by the incomplete construction of an urban development in 1987. This area has been the focus of two LIFE restoration projects aimed at recovering its ecological functionality, and protecting a threatened endemic fish species (Aphanius iberus). Thanks to these projects, a new lagoon was created in 2002 simply by excavating below sea level, which ensured water permanency all year round. Between 2014 and 2017, samples were regularly taken to measure temperature, salinity and water levels in the lagoons of the La Pletera salt marsh. In this study we focus on two natural lagoons (Life A and Life B), and the one created in 2002 (Life C). Using the one-dimensional General Lake Model (GLM), we evaluated water inflows and outflows and evaporation fluxes, since water circulation determines the resultant salinity in these lagoons. This model is an open source model that, to our knowledge, is being used for the first time in such small lagoons. The study focuses mainly on dry periods, when the lagoon inflow is low and evaporation is high. Results show that Life A and Life B are more affected by evaporation and that lagoon water circulation was higher in Life-C. From a management point of view, the maintenance of salinity conditions is fundamental for the protection of Aphanius iberus, a species adapted to high salinity fluctuations but strongly affected by competition from the invasive Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) when water salinity is not high enough or variable. Between 2014 and 2018, additional lagoons were created in the La Pletera salt marsh as part of a new LIFE project. Knowledge of the hydrology and the resultant water salinity in the new lagoons are essential to ensure the continued survival of Aphanius iberus in the area.

AB In order to examine temporal patterns and the hydrological cycle of shallow soda pans, six pans in Hungarian Great Plain were sampled at monthly intervals over a period of 2.5 years. Water chemistry and physical parameters (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, light, water color - Pt color -, turbidity, phosphorous and nitrogen forms, silica, alkalinity, chloride, sulfate content, chemical oxygen demand) were measured both in the field and laboratory and analyzed using multivariate statistical methods. It was possible to distinguish the pans on the basis of water color, separating them into two groups: G1, consisting of colored pans characterized by low turbidity and high Pt color, and G2, consisting of turbid pans characterized by high turbidity and low Pt color. Both groups displayed temporal (seasonal, as well as annual) trends, and their hydrological cycles followed regular cyclical patterns. Three hydrological phases (filling, drying, and desiccated) were described in the case of the colored pans, and five for the turbid (filling, diluted, drying, concentrated, desiccated). Regarding the recommendation that there be a reduced time interval in the sampling to determine the typical chemical characterization of the pans.

AB Prediction of river flow as a fundamental source of hydrological information plays a crucial role in various fields of water projects. In this study, at first, the capabilities of two time series analysis approaches, namely self exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models, then three artificial intelligence approaches including artificial neural networks (ANN), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and random forests (RF) models were investigated to predict monthly river flow. For this purpose, monthly river flow data of Brantford and Galt stations on Grand River, Canada, for the period from October 1948 to September 2017 were used and their performances were evaluated based on various evaluation criteria. The SETAR model showed better performance than the GARCH one in prediction of river flows at the stations of study. Additionally, the stand-alone MARS and RF models performed slightly better than the ANN. Next, hybrid models were developed by coupling the used ANN, MARS, and RF models with SETAR and GARCH models as the non-linear time series models. The performance of various models presented in this study indicated that the new hybrid models demonstrated a much better performance compared with the stand-alone ones at both stations. Among the developed hybrid models, the RF-SETAR models generally had the best accuracy to improve the river flows modeling. As a result, it can be concluded that the presented methodology can be used to predict hydrological time series such as river flow with a high level of accuracy.

AB The Alpine region is a particularly sensitive environment rich in water resources nurturing delicate freshwater ecosystems, which are however threatened by intensive exploitation for hydropower production and irrigated agriculture. The impact of water uses on the hydrological cycle is intimately intertwined with changes of the climatic forcing, which operate over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. In the present study historical time series of streamflow, precipitation and temperature, recorded in the Adige River Basin, a large Alpine watershed in northeastern Italy, are analyzed in order to quantify alterations of the main hydrological fluxes due to changes in climate and water uses. Spatial and temporal patterns of change are detected by comparing annual and seasonal components of the water budget performed in four representative sub-catchments (with size ranging from 207 to 9,852 km(2)) characterized by different climatic and water use conditions. Afterwards, a multi-method approach is applied for attributing the observed changes to their main drivers. Summer stream flow depletion affects the Adige lowlands since the 70s, which is attributed to both the reduction of winter precipitation and the development of irrigated agriculture. Conversely, winter streamflow increased in head-water catchments due to the increase of aquifers recharge in autumn, which is consistent with the increase of precipitation in the same period. These results reveal that the impact of climate change on the Adige Basin is multifaceted, scale-dependent and intertwined with the effects of changes in water resources exploitation.

AB Estimation of groundwater recharge is more essential for managing aquifers, particularly in arid regions with limited access to water resources. Low potentiality of aquifer recharge, deep groundwater levels and impacts from other important sources like irrigation return flow add more complexities to estimating recharge in these areas. In this research, physical and chemical (tracer) techniques including water-table fluctuation (WTF), chloride mass balance (CMB), stable isotopes (H-2 and O-18) and water-budget equation (WBE) were applied to estimate recharge into the Birjand alluvial aquifer in arid areas of SE Iran with a mean annual precipitation of about 147 mm. Recharge rates, in ascending order, were calculated about 5.0, 9.2, 33.2 and 41.7 mm year(-1) using isotopes, CMB, WTF and WBE methods, respectively. Isotopes and chloride tracers assessed the rainfall related aquifer recharge, while the other methods represented total recharge including rainfall infiltration plus deep percolation of irrigation water (irrigation return flow). Total recharge rate of the Birjand aquifer was estimated in average at 37.5 mm year(-1), partitioned between the rainfall recharge (7.0 mm year(-1)) and irrigation return flow (30.5 mm year(-1)). The values represent an average rainfall recharge coefficient of about 4.8% of the annual precipitation and return flow coefficient of 15% of the total annual applied water for irrigation. Recharge estimates are recommended as initial guesses for calculating water-balance in order to manage valuable groundwater resources in other arid-land aquifers. The study highlighted priorities of the stable isotope and WTF methods in estimating rainfall and total (rainfall + return flows) recharge of the groundwater in arid regions, respectively.

AB Point-scale gauge observations have inherent limitations, making it difficult to study the spatial and temporal distributions of precipitation in alpine regions due to gauge undercatch and complex terrains. The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission provides new-generation satellite precipitation products that are promising alternative data sources in mountainous areas. However, quality evaluations and bias corrections should be conducted prior to the application of satellite data. In this study, an unprecedentedly dense ground station network composed of more than 1000 automatic weather stations (AWSs) over the Tianshan Mountains in China are used for bias correction of the Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) product. First, universal kriging interpolation is used to downscale IMERG from 0.1 degrees to 500 m to ensure a fair comparison with the gauge observations. Then, the downscaled IMERG precipitation data over this region are corrected by two methods, i.e., stepwise regression (STEP) and geographically weighted regression (GWR). Both methods are established on various terrain factors and vegetation indexes that have strong relations with precipitation. The results show that (1) GWR outperform the conventional STEP method as well as the original IMERG; (2) the original IMERG performs best over the plain region (less than 1000 m), while the best correction effect was found in middle and low-elevation region (1000-1500 m); and (3) the performance of the GWR model is largely dependent on the number of available training stations in mountainous areas. Overall, the methods and results presented in this study provide insight into the correction of satellite precipitation data in mountainous areas with scarce ground observations.

AB Hydrologic control structures are designed to connect or disconnect water movement in natural surface water-groundwater systems, and it is important to represent these features effectively within a finite difference/element model without over-discretization. This study presents efficient numerical schemes for operating water allocation and water rights systems in integrated hydrosystem models. We developed a numerical scheme for representing these structures directly within integrated surface/subsurface hydrologic models by creating boundary condition links to route water through control structures or by breaking nodal connections to prevent water flow. The boundary condition linking and mesh cutoff schemes minimize the need for mesh regeneration and modification. Through illustrative examples involving agricultural tile drainage and dam-reservoir operation systems, the numerical connection (boundary condition linking) and disconnection (mesh cutoff) techniques are demonstrated to be effective and efficient at simulating the hydrological processes affected by anthropogenic water resources controls. A proof-of-concept demonstration consisting of complex water supply (dam and groundwater pumping wells) and demand (farms, municipality, and stream) highlights how the numerical schemes for water management operations can be used to optimize surface water and groundwater extraction and distribution using a fully-integrated model.

AB Intensity Duration Frequency (IDF) curves are important tools for hydraulic and hydrologic design. Considering that there are different approaches to obtain the rainfall quantiles on which the IDF curves are based, the availability of a method to evaluate their reliability is of great importance. With this aim, in this work the multifractal properties of hourly rainfall data recorded at 23 rain gauges in the Umbria Region (Italy) have been used to select the most appropriate frequency analysis method of extreme annual rainfall at each location. Three methods have been tested: Local Frequency Analysis (by fitting at each station extreme annual rainfall data of different durations by a probability distribution function), Regional Frequency Analysis approach based on L-Moments and flood index method (considering the extreme annual rainfall data from all the stations), and a variant of the latter method known as In-site Regional Frequency Analysis (based on the consideration of the station as a region). Therefore, quantiles of rainfall for different durations and return periods have been obtained. These quantiles have been fitted to the Montana Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curve. The scaling properties of rainfall have been obtained through out the empirical moments scaling function K(q). Their comparison with some scaling behavior properties of the IDF curves has let the selection of the most adequate quantile estimation method at each site, being the Regional Frequency Analysis the most appropriate one for 14 out of the 23 sites included in the study.

AB Better understanding of raindrop detachment, interrill wash and erosion-limiting degree in interrill processes is critical for accurately modelling interrill erosion and implementing proper anti-erosion strategies. Simulated rainfall experiments were conducted on a clayey loessal soil at three rainfall intensities (42, 60 and 90 mm h(-1)), five slope gradients (7 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees and 25 degrees) and rainfall duration of 40 min. Results showed that raindrop detachment rate initially decreased rapidly within a few minutes and then reached a relative steady state during rainfall. The initial and steady raindrop detachment rate increased with increased rainfall intensity. Interrill wash rate peaked early and then decreased to a relative constant rate during the rainfall. The initial, maximum and steady interrill wash rate increased with increased rainfall intensity and slope gradient. Erosion-limiting degree (ELD), defined as the ratio of interrill wash rate to raindrop detachment rate, ranged from 10.99% to 35.70% under experimental conditions, indicating that interrill erosion system was transport-limited. The ELD decreased with rainfall intensity and increased linearly (R-2 = 0.90) with slope gradient. The higher the rainfall intensity, the stronger the transport-limiting in interrill erosion processes; the steeper the slope gradient, the weaker the transport-limiting in interrill erosion processes. Raindrop detachment is the dominant process in detaching soil particles, whereas interrill flow contributes to washing out detached sediments. The findings of this study, especially ELD, largely improved the understanding of interrill erosion processes.

AB This study examines the question of how much information one can extract from a tracer-based hydrograph separation in a remote and minimally gaged alpine catchment in Chile. We combine PCA-based endmember mixing analysis to identify the sources of flow contribution to the Diguillin River with a hierarchical Bayesian mixing model to integrate spatial and temporal variability in endmember concentration and quantify the source contributions to streamflow over time. The PCA-analysis shows that precipitation isotopes do not vary by elevation (e.g. snow and rainfall had identical signatures) but vary significantly by season, and that a third endmember is necessary to bound streamflow variability at the basin outlet, which was not captured by our field sampling. One of the main advantages of Bayesian methods is the quasi-machine learning capabilities, where we treated the third endmember as a parameter from which the mixing model could both estimate proportional contributions as well as posterior estimates for the tracer concentrations.
   The two tracer, three endmember hydrograph separation revealed groundwater to be the largest and precipitation (rain and snow) to be the smallest contributor, on average, to streamflow with the third unknown endmember contributing around 40% of streamflow during the Winter wet season. We hypothesize that inter flow is occurring as the third endmember in the Alto Diguillin subwatershed, based on inferred tracer values and the presence of alluvium atop impermeable bedrock along certain reaches. More work is necessary to observe and sample these flowpaths, which was not possible during this study. The results of this work have implications for water resource management, since groundwater sustains the majority of streamflow in the Diguillfn, and climate change will impact the timing and quantity of baseflow and interflow. Overall, we demonstrate the utility of combining PCA with Bayesian statistical modeling and inference to extract maximum information from a limited field dataset in a remote alpine catchment. The findings of this work can guide future water management in the Diguillfn, but also provide clear questions for future research.

AB This study deals with the time-dependent nonlinear response of catchments to the variations in rainfall. Both the rainfall and runoff discharge fields are treated to be nonstationary in time. A functional series representation, a generalization of the linear convolution integral, is employed to quantify the nonlinear relation between the input and output. The Fourier-Stieltjes representation approach is used to evaluate the variance of runoff discharge in the spectral frequency domain. The analysis based on the spectral solution for the runoff discharge variance clearly demonstrates that larger values of rainfall characteristic time scale or catchment size parameter lead to larger variability of the runoff discharge, while a larger catchment scale parameter leads to smaller variability of the runoff discharge.

AB Consistent hydrological models for multiple time steps are needed to respond to the operational requirement of using a model for different objectives and with varied data sets. In this paper, we propose a rationale for multi-time step model development based on the temporal consistency of the fluxes modelled. The new methodology is applied for the temporal downscaling of a lumped rainfall-runoff model (GR4J) from daily to sub-hourly time steps, within a coherent modelling framework. The modelling tests are performed at eight time steps from daily to 6-min, for a set of 240 French catchments, for which 2400 flood events were selected. To identify an improved multi-time step model structure, a two-step approach is followed. First, we propose a model diagnosis to evaluate the internal behaviour of the baseline model across time steps, whereby a significant inconsistency was found in the simulated water fluxes, especially interception. Second, we recommend a prognosis to improve the scale invariance of the modelled water balance by matching the model fluxes across time scales. The new model structure retained for sub-daily time steps is derived from the daily baseline model by refining the representation of the interception process, so that the flux-matching condition is satisfied. A complementary modification of the groundwater exchange function is also resumed following a previous study. The structural changes are motivated by the improvement of model flux consistency across time steps, while also improving model performance. This new dual paradigm for model identification, based on both flux coherence and output accuracy, also results in more robust model parameters across time steps.

AB A typical deficiency of ensemble forecasts is the lack of calibration; e.g., ensemble members are under-dispersed and, consequently, probabilities estimated from them cannot be taken at their face values. Self-calibration is one of the unique theoretic properties of the Bayesian forecasting system, BFS. Its ensemble version, EBFS, inherits this property, provided the ensemble size is large enough. That requirement motivated the version with randomization, EBFSR, presented in part I. Its unique advantage is the operational feasibility of generating a hydrologic ensemble forecast of large size, M (having hundreds or even thousands of members), from a meteorologic input ensemble forecast of small size, M-I (having only tens or hundreds of members): M-I < M, with M = M-I/R, where R stands for randomization factor (R > 1 and integer). This R-fold enlargement of the ensemble size is achieved through a Monte Carlo generator (sans extra runs of the hydrologic model) and, therefore, requires little extra effort or computing time. But what are the statistical implications?
   The objective of this part II is to identify experimentally the sampling properties of the EBFSR so that its advantage can be properly harnessed in operational forecasting. The core matter to understand and to quantify is the tradeoff between the computing efficiency and the statistical efficiency of the EBFSR. This is so because the user must specify (i) the largest acceptable sampling error [measured in terms of the average expected maximum absolute difference, (E) over bar (MAD), between the true but unknown predictive distribution function of the forecasted variate and the empirical distribution function estimated from a sample of size m, a fraction of the ensemble size M], and (ii) the tradeoff between M-I and R. Critical to deciding this tradeoff are two relationships: (E) over bar (MAD) = xi(m) and M-E = tau(M-P, R), where M-P is the size of the input sub-ensemble with positive precipitation amounts, and M-E is the effective sample size of the output sub-ensemble of size MPR. In terms of output/input ensemble sizes, the computing efficiency is M/M-I = R > 1, and the statistical efficiency is M-E/MPR < 1 because M-P < M-E < MPR.
   Based on results of large numerical experiments, general parametric forms of xi and tau are identified, and the dependence of the parameter values is established on factors such as the forecast type (probabilistic river stage forecast, probabilistic stage transition forecast, probabilistic flood forecast), the forecast lead time, the magnitude of the precipitation input uncertainty, and the informativeness of the deterministic hydrologic model employed by the EBFSR. Finally, two algorithms are formulated to aid the user in specifying the values of M and R, such that <(E)over bar>(MAD) does not exceed the largest acceptable value and that operational constraints are satisfied (e.g., constraints regarding the input ensemble size M-I or the feasible number of runs of the hydrologic model).

AB Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) is a key property in hydrological and environmental studies. As its measurement is unfortunately cumbersome, pedotransfer functions (PTFs) have been commonly used to estimate it. The literature brings a large number of Ks PTFs, most of which have been developed for temperate regions, small databases and/or limited territorial scales. The presence of soil structural variables in these models, such as those related to the water retention curve, is less common than the use of granulometric fractions and bulk density (BD). One objective of this work was to develop Ks PTFs for a database of tropical (Brazilian) and temperate (European) soils that include soil texture and/or BD, as well as effective porosity (EP) [total porosity minus theta (300-cm suction)], which is a soil structural property. This study evaluated the performances of the proposed PTFs and compared their predictions to those from seven models used in the literature, considering a testing database with characteristics similar to the calibration dataset. Comparison of the performances of the PTFs were made at three levels of representation of the study databases: all soils, temperate and tropical soils, and textural class groups. The results showed that the PIT proposed based only on EP was more accurate and reliable than the PTFs based only on texture and/or BD, also with greater reliability than the other models from the literature, reinforcing the importance of using structural variables in the estimation of Ks. We confirmed that the use of models developed for temperate soils based on texture and/or BD must be avoided in the prediction of Ks of tropical soils and vice versa. This study indicates the need for including new predictors in Ks PTFs, especially those that reflect macropore flows better. In addition, standard and more representative Ks measurement methods, based on an adequate sample size, are also required for achieving more accurate Ks predictions.

AB Why water diplomacy? What does diplomacy have to do with water? Is cooperation over transboundary surface and ground waters the exclusive domain of diplomats and foreign policy experts? Or mainly the purview of water professionals negotiating agreements on shared water resources? Why should non-governmental stakeholders be involved in transboundary water dialogues? These questions lie at the heart of debates and dialogues around the theory and practice of water diplomacy.
   The main aim of this Special Issue is to elaborate the intersect of science, policy, and practice and discuss ways knowledge can be distributed more equally and bridged across these spheres. In this editorial article, we summarize key messages on water diplomacy brought forward by authors in this Special Issue. We have identified the trends below as a possible future direction on water diplomacy research as well as issues that need to be addressed in the policy debate. One of the overarching themes is how to ensure that available technical knowledge informs the political tracks of water diplomacy and how to build trust effectively to ensure sustainability of water cooperation processes.

AB In this study, effort is made to estimate weekly rainfall over India at 36 meteorological subdivisions during monsoon 2016 (June to September) by using several precipitation products from different satellites which include Indian National Satellite System (INSAT) INSAT-3D derived Hydro Estimate (HE), INSAT Multi-Spectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA) rainfall products, Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) derived from JPL, NASA, and National Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) Merged Satellite Gauge (NMSG) of IMD. Different satellite estimates, and rain gauge satellite merged products have been compared with gridded rainfall products prepared by India Meteorological Department (IMD). HE at 4 km pixel resolution and IMSRA at 0.10(0) x 0.10(0) resolution are derived rainfall products from Indian satellite INSAT-3D.GPM (IMERG) product is derived at 0.10(0) x 0.10(0) resolution from Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) satellite jointly operated by JAXA (Japan) and NASA (USA). NCMRWF Merged Satellite-Gauge (NMSG) rainfall data has been generated at a 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees grid resolution by IMD & NCMRWF. The data is analyzed preliminarily for the southwest monsoon season of 2016 at weekly temporal resolution. The overall comparison shows that GPM (IMERG) estimates better rainfall over the coastal and plain region, however, HE estimates better rainfall over the hilly region, in general, and for Kerala region, particularly. NMSG product needs improvement over the hilly region and considerable improvement is required in IMSRA product. For all 36 meteorological subdivisions, NMSG product has 0.56 average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies (NSE) for 17 weeks with IMD Gridded rainfall data. However, for satellite-derived rainfall by GPM (IMERG), HE and IMSRA have 0.29, 0.1 and -0.8 average NSE at 17 weeks, respectively. Based on this study, it is concluded that NMSG daily rainfall product is best, however, amongst satellite-derived rainfall, overall GPM gives a better result with a few exceptions and IMSRA need more modifications.

AB One biotechnology that can reduce nitrate concentration in subsurface drainage water is called a denitrification bed. Bromide tracer testing has been used to determine the hydraulic properties of these systems to be used in design and modeling, but efficacy of bromide tracers has not been investigated. One important hydraulic property of woodchip beds is its in-situ effective porosity. The objectives of this study were to (1) determine if bromide is a suitable tracer for evaluating the hydraulics of woodchip beds based on laboratory sorption experiments and field tracer testing, and (2) to determine the in-situ effective porosity of denitrification beds. To achieve this goal, we conducted bromide sorption experiments in the laboratory, and conducted bromide tracer testing in seven denitrification beds near Willmar, Minnesota, USA. We did not find sorption (neither adsorption nor absorption) of bromide to woodchips in our laboratory sorption experiments. In contrast, bromide tracer tests showed an average bromide recovery of 82%, revealing that bromide was retarded in the woodchip de nitrification beds. To the best of our knowledge, our experiment is the first study to estimate the in-situ effective porosity (average of 0.61) of a typical field-scale denitrification bed using a tracer test. A more accurate estimate of the actual hydraulic retention time (HRT) can be obtained by using the in-situ effective porosity rather than total porosity. Our laboratory experiment did not show any sorption of bromide to woodchips, but in contrast and for unclear reasons, our field tracer testing showed bromide retardation.

AB Grassland restored by re-vegetated shrub is an important ecosystem in desert steppe of Northwest China. Yet little is understood about the underlying eco-hydrological mechanisms for maintaining the stability of the re vegetated ecosystem. Based on the conversion relationships among throughfall, interception loss, and stemflow, we developed a method to analyze the dynamic responses of rainfall partitioning by vegetation canopies to precipitation variation, and the driving mechanisms for stemflow of two morphological distinct shrubs (unhealthy and healthy C. intermedia) during the 21 rainfall events (0-15 mm) in the period from 2016 to 2017. We found that the stemflow increased in a low-value stepwise manner with the increasing rainfall depth and eventually became scattered. Therefore, the response of stemflow to gross precipitation was divided into three stages by rainfall depth: initiation (0-2 mm), transition (2-6 mm), and scattered (6-15 mm). A significantly negative linear relationship was observed between throughfall and interception loss, while the relationships of interception loss- stemflow and throughfall- stemflow exhibited a more complex nonlinear way with relatively weaker correlations. Rainfall depth and canopy area were two main factors driving the partitioning relationships. Non-precipitation meteorological factors were dominant in the 0-2 mm rainfall events, while rainfall factors were determinant in the 6-15 mm events. Morphological factors exerted more influences on the partitioning relationships for healthy C. intermedia. Overall, the conversion between throughfall and interception loss was the majority of dynamic rainfall partitioning; therefore, low and unstable stemflow was usually inevitable. The results indicate that the precipitation threshold for stemflow generation should be a range value instead of a specific value, and the rebuilt analysis roadmaps are essential for investigating stemflow using the thorough conversion relationships and the 'stepped' approach.

AB 2009 similar to 2010 was a critical period for the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) transition from staged impoundment to full operation. This study reports on the composition of nutrients in the whole Changjiang and retention effect of the reservoir during the transitional period, and the potential impact of the reservoir impoundment on the eutrophication of the TGR and estuary. Water samples were collected in the mainstream and tributaries of Changjiang from August to October 2009 and June 2010 to analyze the concentrations of dissolved and particulate nutrients, and suspended particulate matter (SPM). The Changjiang was enriched with dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), dissolved silicate (DSi) and SPM, but depleted in PO43- and biogenic silica (BSi), with higher DIN:PO43- and DSi:PO43- ratios. DIN and PO43- concentrations were lower in the Jinshajiang, but increased in the Mid-downstream of the Changjiang due to high human activities and nutrients import from major tributaries. DSi concentration varied little along the Changjiang, and was relatively low in the TGR. Particulate inorganic phosphorus (PIP), total particulate phosphorus (TPP) and BSi concentrations were very high in the Jinshajiang, and then dramatically decreased with the SPM in the TGR. The northern tributaries contributed more nutrients to the Changjiang than the southern tributaries. Depending on the nutrients input-output mass balance model, the retention of nutrients in the TGR were higher for TPP and BSi, lower for dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP). Total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total phosphorus (TP) and DSi retained in the reservoir accounted for 15%, 12% and 1%, respectively of the TDN, TP and DSi fluxes in the Datong station near the estuary. Historical data showed that the impoundment of the TGD greatly contributed to the eutrophication of the reservoir and estuary. Since 2003, algal blooms were likely to occur in the TGR, estuary and adjacent seas, but the outbreak frequency and area of red tides in the East China Sea (ECS) dramatically decreased. Therefore, further study is required to estimate the response of estuarine ecosystem on the dispatching mode of the TGR.

AB Formation of soil crusts results in reduced infiltration, increased runoff, and reduced rainfall and irrigation efficiency. Improved knowledge of the hydrological properties of soil crusts is required to improve simulation of infiltration and soil water movement in crop-soil-water models. Development of soil crust algorithms in soil water models is limited by a lack of in situ and laboratory approaches for measuring the physical properties of soil crusts. In this study we evaluate a number of novel and modified approaches for determining changes in the hydraulic properties of soil crusts formed in an intensively cropped sandy loam. Physical crust formation over a 71 day period resulted in an increase in surface soil density from 1.17 to 1.51 g cm(-3), a reduction in infiltration from 474 to 33.2 mm h(-1), and a decrease in unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at - 0.05 kPa from 136.9 to 10.14 mm h(-1). Whilst the ability to determine the van Genuchten properties of soil crusts was progressed, uncertainty with matching crust thickness to sampling depth, and difficulty measuring the total porosity of soil crusts resulted in error and uncertainty in the estimation of the theta s parameter and to a lesser extent the alpha and eta parameters. Further work is required to improve the development of simple, in situ means of measuring or estimating the physical properties of soil crusts.

AB Various methods have been proposed to define the rainfall thresholds for the landslide prediction. Once the threshold is determined, it remains the same regardless of the antecedent soil moisture conditions. However, given the important role of the antecedent soil moisture in the initiation of landslides, it is considered if the rainfall threshold level varies according to the antecedent soil moisture conditions, the prediction performance will be improved. Therefore, in this study we propose a probabilistic threshold to integrate antecedent soil moisture conditions with rainfall thresholds. In order to take into account the conditions with landslides and without landslides, the Bayesian analysis is applied to estimate the landslide occurrence probability given the various combinations of two factors: the antecedent soil moisture and the severity of the recent rainfall event. These combinations are then divided into conditions that are likely to trigger landslides and those unlikely to trigger landslides by comparing their probabilities with a critical value. In this way, the probabilistic threshold is determined. Here the soil moisture is estimated using the distributed hydrological model, and the severity of the rainfall event is characterized by the cumulated event rainfall-rainfall duration (ED) thresholds with different exceedance probabilities. The proposed approach was applied to a sub-region of the Emilia-Romagna region in northern Italy. The results show that the probabilistic threshold has a better prediction performance than the ED rainfall threshold, especially in terms of reducing false alarms. This study provides an effective approach to improve the prediction capability of the ED rainfall threshold, benefiting its application in the landslide prediction.

AB Quantifying vertical flows in long-screened or open wells is essential for their reliable use in all types of groundwater investigations. In ambient conditions, a flow profile shows the producing/receiving zones of head-driven flow, the relative vertical head gradient in the aquifer system and potential bias in chemistry samples. A flow profile while pumping can be used to quantify aquifer heterogeneity and the sampled water mixtures. This paper describes a novel approach to a single-well tracer test to quantify the flow regime in a pumped well, which is unique in its utility over a wide range of discharge rates. During constant pumping, a tracer is injected at the opposite end of the well and, as it is drawn towards the pump, the tracer is diluted in proportion to each inflow. A dilution model using the advection-dispersion equation is used to visually fit a flow profile that explains all tracer profiles (pre-injection, transient phase and steady-state). Results compare favourably to borehole EM flowmeter data, particularly if tracer density issues are correctly interpreted and head-loss in the flowmeter is avoided. A dimensionless Froude number is provided to assist both with understanding and minimising the role of free convection when planning all types of in-well tracer tests involving a density contrast. Like the flowmeter, this method is particularly suited to screened wells, where packers are ineffective. Used together or separately in existing wells, these in-well methods can provide considerable information on aquifer-well hydraulics without the cost of additional drilling.

AB We rely on various Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) approaches to detect the way uncertain parameters linked to diverse conceptual geological models influence spatial distributions of hydraulic heads in a three-dimensional complex groundwater system. We showcase our analyses by considering a highly heterogeneous, large scale aquifer system located in Northern Italy. Groundwater flow is simulated considering alternative conceptual models employed to reconstruct the spatial arrangement of the geomaterials forming the internal makeup of the domain and characterizing the distribution of hydraulic conductivities. For each conceptual model, uncertain factors include the values of hydraulic conductivity associated with the geomaterials composing the aquifer as well as the system boundary conditions. We explore the relative influence of parametric uncertainties to steadystate hydraulic head distributions across the set of conceptual models considered by way of three GSA methodologies, i.e., (a) a derivative-based approach, which rests on the Morris indices; (b) the classical variance based approach, grounded on the evaluation of the Sobol' indices; and (c) a moment-based GSA, which takes into account the influence of uncertain parameters on multiple (statistical) moments of a given model output. Due to computational costs, Sobol' and moment-based indices are obtained numerically through the use of a model order reduction technique based on the polynomial chaos expansion approach. We find that the sensitivity measures considered convey different yet complementary information. The choice of the conceptual model employed to characterize the lithological reconstruction of the aquifer affects the degree of influence that uncertain parameters can have on modeling results.

AB The conventional flood frequency analysis typically assumes the annual maximum flood series (AMFS) result from a homogeneous flood population. However, actually AMFS are frequently generated by distinct flood generation mechanisms (FGMs), which are controlled by the interaction between different meteorological triggers (e.g., thunderstorms, typhoon, snowmelt) and properties of underlying surface (e.g., antecedent soil moisture and land-cover types). To consider the possibility of two FGMs in flood frequency analysis, researchers often use the two-component mixture distributions (TCMD) without explicitly linking each component distribution to a particular FGM. To improve the mixture distribution modeling in seasonally snow covered regions, an index called flood timescale (FT), defined as the ratio of the flood volume to peak value and chosen to reflect the relevant FGM, is employed to classify each flood into one of two types, i.e., the snowmelt-induced long duration floods and the rainfall-induced short-duration floods, thus identifying the weighting coefficient of each component distribution beforehand. In applying the FT-based TCMD to model the AMPS of 34 watersheds in Norway, ten types of mixture distributions are considered. The design floods and associated confidence intervals are calculated using parametric bootstrap method. The results indicate that the FT-based TCMD model reduces the uncertainty in the estimation of design floods for high return periods by up to 40% with respect to the traditional TCMD. The improved predictive ability of the FT-based TCMD model is attributed to its explicit recognition of distinct generation mechanisms of floods, thereby being able to identify the weighting coefficient and FGM of each component distribution without optimization.

AB The east-central North China Plain (NCP) is a globally representative area that presents a sharp contradiction between deep groundwater exploitation and grain production. Evaluating the effects of limited irrigation on crop water productivity (WP) and deep groundwater exploitation reduction in this area is important for developing sustainable agricultural practices. In this study, the 11 limited irrigation scenarios were simulated and analyzed using the distributed Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant-WOrld-FOod-STudy (SWAP-WOFOST) model that was established, calibrated and validated in a companion paper; the recommended irrigation timing for maximizing the yield or WP of winter wheat was selected; the irrigation scheme for minimizing evapotranspiration constrained by 14 winter wheat yield reduction thresholds was optimized separately; and further the effects of the optimized irrigation scheme on saving water and reducing deep groundwater exploitation were evaluated. The results showed that the recommended irrigation timing was predominantly in the pre-sowing, booting to anthesis and early grain-filling stages for three irrigations, the pre-sowing and booting to anthesis stages for two irrigations, and the booting to anthesis stage for one irrigation. Adopting the optimized irrigation scheme with the threshold of 60% could achieve the goal of reducing deep groundwater exploitation by 6.05 x 10(8) m(3) but reduced winter wheat yield by approximately 50%. The contribution index of reducing exploitation (CIRE) was defined to identify the contribution of implementing the optimized irrigation scheme to reducing current deep groundwater exploitation. At the related water resource subregional level, the CIRE values showed that this contribution was relatively higher in the related Tuhai and Majia Rivers plain (THMJHP), the related plain of the Zhangwei River basin (ZWHP) and the related plain of the Ziya River basin (ZYHP). Following the framework of simulation-optimization-evaluation, the three results at the manageable county level, namely, the optimized irrigation scheme under the constraint of 14 thresholds, the crop yield variation compared with the current irrigation schedule and the CIRE values, provide decision-making references for implementing limited irrigation for winter wheat under local conditions to achieve the target of deep groundwater exploitation reduction.

AB Remote sensing, as a crucial method to obtain information on water environmental processes, has become a major source of data, particularly of water environment and water resources, which are sensitive to global climate change. The bibliometric analysis provided here shows the research characteristics and developments of remote sensing-based observations of water environmental processes under a changing climate from 2000 to 2018. Visualized knowledge mapping is introduced to investigate the development status, scientific collaboration, involved disciplines, research hotspots and emerging trends of this field. The breadth and depth of remote sensing application in water environmental process studies have improved significantly as the number of related publications rose at an average annual growth rate of 15.97% in the 21st century. The United States and China were the leading contributors with the largest number of publications and all of the top 15 most active institutions. In addition, this field is a highly interdisciplinary field that covers a wide range of interests, from water resources to environmental science, geology, engineering, ecology, and agriculture. The application of remote sensing technology has significantly promoted the estimation of evapotranspiration and soil moisture, thereby offering a more complete perspective to the understanding of the water cycle. Additionally, climate change and its complex interactions with water environmental processes, including the occurrence of drought events, are of great significance and require special attention.

AB The freeze-thaw cycle in the active soil layer plays a crucial role in cold-region hydrological processes, yet the effect of vertical water migration caused by the soil frost on shallow groundwater remains poorly quantified. The shallow groundwater level (GWL), soil frost depth and main environmental controls were monitored in a humid alpine meadow on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from 2012 to 2017. GWL fluctuated with two seasonal maxima and minima during soil frost-centric year from November to October. GWL declined remarkably from the strong peak (3.9 +/- 0.2 m, Mean +/- S.D.) in mid-January to the strong minimum (4.8 +/- 0.1 m) in mid-May, and then increased to the second peak (4.2 +/- 0.2 m) in late August. This seasonal variability in GWL was mainly attributed to the freeze-thaw processes of the lower layer soil frost from November to late June both at a similar to 45-day delay, respectively. The clear increasing GWL from mid-November to mid-January was probably related to the melted upper layer soil frost, which was detained in subsoil layers because of the high thermal isolating effect in topsoil Mattic Epipedon (dense organic-rich turf) and the associated negative subsoil profile temperature gradient from mid-May to late August. The seasonal N-type in GWL was thus hysteretically determined by the soil freeze-thaw processes and the related subsoil profile temperature gradient. Annually, GWL was significantly correlated with air temperature (R-2 = 0.88, P = 0.003, N = 6), suggesting the shallow groundwater recharges would be weakened under the warming scenario. Annual GWL was not directly connected with annual precipitation (P = 0.81), likely owing to the high water holding capacity of the topsoil Mattic Epipedon and the similarity between precipitation input and evapotranspiration loss. This critical buffering function of the topsoil Mattic Epipedon in vertical moisture movement should be taken into consideration when modeling regional water dynamics in humid alpine meadows.

AB Forests act as 'pumps' through their evapotranspiration (E-tot) and as 'sponges' by enhancing soil infiltration capacity and moisture retention. Tropical deforestation and poor post-forest land management generally result in lower E-tot, but also reduce infiltration. Strongly diminished infiltration is typically accompanied by enhanced overland flow and can cause reduced groundwater recharge and baseflows. A grid-based land surface hydrological model (W3RA LUM) was tailored to incorporate the trade-offs between the 'pump' and 'sponge' effects to investigate where deforestation can be expected to have the greatest impacts on dry-season flows. Streamflow sensitivity analyses for scenarios with or without full forest cover and/or good versus poor surface infiltration were performed for: (i) selected tropical catchments with documented changes in streamflow after deforestation; and (ii) the tropics at large (23.5 degrees N to 35 degrees S, to include important seasonal montane forests). The catchment sensitivity analyses showed that W3A LUM captured the streamflow response to imposed deforestation and changes in surface conditions reasonably well. For the tropics as a whole, an increase in mean annual streamflow of 18% was obtained for forest conversion (to pasture) only, versus 26% after an additional imposed reduction in surface infiltration. Much of the inferred flow increases concerned water-limited regions. A reduction in dry-season flows was predicted for nearly one-fifth of all grid cells (despite lower E-tot after forest conversion) after impaired infiltration, marking potential 'hot spots' of hydrological change after deforestation and reduced infiltration due to surface degradation. The affected grid cells shared the following key characteristics: (i) strong seasonality; (ii) high infiltration capacity under forested conditions; (iii) sufficient wet-season precipitation to recharge deep soil- and groundwater stores; (iv) sufficient soil water storage under forested conditions to 'carry over' infiltrated wet-season rainfall into the subsequent dry season; and (v) slow groundwater recession maintaining baseflow throughout the dry season.
   Our results demonstrate that forest removal in highly seasonal tropical catchments, whilst typically increasing mean annual water yield, can indeed decrease dry-season flows, depending on pre- and post-forest removal surface conditions and groundwater response times.

AB In the last few decades, the northern region of Iraq has been severely impacted by climate change, which has created long-term drought, water shortage, and casual flood events. Dam construction in suitable sites is a primary water management strategy to solve flood and drought. Dam site selection depends on a set of qualitative and quantitative criteria, such as geology, soil type, and altitude. In this study, appropriate areas of dam site selection for water management were identified using remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS), and multi-criteria decision making techniques. In addition, the proposed method of site suitability was evaluated by comparing it with the traditional analytic hierarchy process (AHP). A new validation method to evaluate the accuracy of AHP and fuzzy logic according to the preselected location of a darn was previously suggested in the study area (Bekhme darn) by the local government. Remote sensing data (Landsat imageries and ASTER DEM) and field/reference maps were used to derive 12 conditioning factors needed to produce a suitability map for construction. The criteria considered were geological formation, soil type, fault line, tectonic line, altitude, slope, rainfall data (2000-2011), water discharge, land use/cover, road network, and material used for dam construction. Two mathematical models, namely, AHP and fuzzy logic, were applied in this study. The best model was selected by using location and cluster-based accuracy assessment depending on the proposed dam site (i.e., Bekhme dam). Results showed that fuzzy logic is more accurate than AHP. In terms of the surface area of suitable lands identified, the AHP model determined 13,446,900 m(2) as a highly suitable area, whereas the fuzzy model identified 3,409,200 m(2) from the total area of 69,347,700 m(2). Finally, this study identified four sites for intermediate and large dams in the study area. The total water capacities of proposed Dam 1, Dam 2, Dam 3, and Dam 4 are about 81.5, 239.3, 374.6, and 646.5 million m(3), respectively, when the dam height is 60 m. The proposed methods can be easily replicated to other areas for similar applications. The finding reveals that AHP model is distributed and scattered in the whole study area, whereas the fuzzy model is more suitable for clustered areas.

AB Low impact development (LID) practices can mitigate adverse impacts of urbanization on hydrology and water quality by using decentralized designs to control stormwater runoff at the source. Most previous research has focused on LID impacts on stormwater runoff with little consideration given to baseflow or road salt pollution. This study describes a modeling approach to assess how effectively retrofitted LID technologies can reduce salt contamination. The model coupled the curve number approach with completely mixed reservoirs to simulate watershed hydrology and solute transport. The model was tested in Boone Creek Watershed (BCW), an urban headwater watershed in the Southern Appalachians. The model proves able to capture daily stream discharge and stream chloride (Cl-) concentrations satisfactorily. The model simulation with and without LID showed LID can decrease surface runoff and increase recharge, baseflow, and interflow. Furthermore, LID led to increased Cl- load in baseflow, interflow, and recharge. Cl- load in runoff and maximum stream Cl- concentration decreased when LID is implemented. The model was run with retrofitting scenarios of various LID practices including pervious pavement, swales, rain gardens/cisterns, bioretention systems, green roofs, disconnecting conveyances from impervious surfaces, and all LID practices combined in BCW. Implementing LID reduced storm runoff by 0.21-27.8% and increased groundwater recharge by 0.05-6.26%. Mean stream Cl- concentrations stayed unchanged while the maximum stream Cl- concentration decreased by 0.03-4.78% after LID practices were implemented. The results also suggest that pervious pavement might be the best retrofitting option, particularly in commercial and high-density residential areas in BCW and other similar urban watersheds. Overall, our study suggests that LID practices could mitigate stream salt contamination by dilution from enhanced groundwater recharge. Our study further suggests this model could be used as a quick screening tool to determine an effective strategy for implementing LID practices in urban areas.

AB This study provides experimental evidence of Forchheimer flow and transition between flow regimes from the perspective of particle uniformity coefficient. We have designed two series of experiments to investigate the particle size control on Forchheimer flow, including two kinds of quartz sands with mixed particle sizes according to different mass ratio, and five particle sizes mixed according to different uniformity coefficients. For the experimental results of two mixed particle sizes, the critical Reynolds number (Re) corresponding to the transition of flow regimes increases with the increase of coarser particle content. Besides, deviation from Darcian flow has been observed from experimental results of mixed five particle sizes. Specifically, the pre-Darcian flow regime, or non-Darcian flow at low velocity in which the "pseudo" hydraulic conductivity increases with Re, has not been observed, where the "pseudo" hydraulic conductivity is defined as the ratio of the specific discharge over the hydraulic gradient. However, the post-Darcian flow regime, or non-Darcian flow at high velocity in which the "pseudo" hydraulic conductivity begins to decrease when Re reaches a certain value, has been identified. In contrast, above observations are absent in experiments using single-size particles even when the size of the single-size particles is the same as the mean size of the mixed-size particles. A greater discrepancy among the particle sizes in the mixed-size particles used in the flow experiments results in a lower "pseudo" hydraulic conductivity even when the mean size of the mixed-size particles remains the same. The degree of deviation from the Darcian flow has been quantified, and the relation between a newly defined Reynolds number for Forchheimer flow (Re-F) and the friction factor are constructed. Our experiments show that when Re-F is greater than 0.1, the experimental data begin to deviate from Darcian flow considerably. This study shows that the uniformity coefficient of porous media, which is a term used to describe the pore size distribution, is a critical factor for determining the flow regimes besides the mean particle sizes.

AB It is computationally difficult to model unsaturated flow through a highly fractured rock system that contains porous rock matrix, densely distributed fracture networks and narrowly spaced drainage holes. We present an efficient numerical procedure that uses a three-dimensional, finite-element model to solve Richards' equation with embedded zero-thickness elements for fractures and line elements for drainage holes. A mixed boundary condition is applied at potential seepage surfaces and a water retention relation with extremely narrow unsaturated zone is specified to precisely locate the phreatic surface. The procedure compares favorably with results from other numerical solutions and experimental data. A case study is developed to evaluate seepage through a densely fractured rock slope. The simulated results demonstrate that fractures disorder the hydraulic potential distribution with fracture patterns acting as significant influential factors and drainage holes dramatically lower the phreatic surface due to the effects of drainage and depressurization. The proposed numerical procedure shows to be capable of investigating the unsaturated flow in highly fractured rock mass.

TI ERT and salinity - A method to determine whether ERT-detected

AB The identification of preferential flow generation and the tracking of their pathways in agricultural soils are challenging tasks, in particular while keeping the soil profile undisturbed. The noninvasive electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) method seems, a priori, to be an ideal tool for these purposes, but the simultaneous dependence of soil electrical resistivity (ER) on soil moisture content and salt concentration poses a problem when high-salinity water is involved. The dependence of these variables is expressed, for example, by Archie's law. Irrigation with brackish or treated wastewater are two such complicated cases. The latter has been found to render soils water-repellent with inherent flow in preferential pathways. A method that resolves this complication is developed and applied for in-situ-measured ERT data. This method combines a model that simulates the preferential ER(t) as a series of interconnected well-mixed units (WMUs) with frequent ERT scans during soil wetting and subsequent drying. Following validation by comparison of its output to simulations using the Richards equation for flow and convection-dispersion equation for transport, the WMU model was used to simulate scenarios of simultaneous variations in moisture content, salinity, and ER(t) in a well-mixed soil volume (unit). The characteristic patterns acquired by these simulations were compared with in-situ measured ER(z,t) to determine whether the observed preferential ER pathways coincide with preferential flow or salinity pathways, or both. From the eight sections in the profile where this analysis was made for, five exhibit preferential flow, characterized by fast wetting front propagation that includes by-passing of a certain soil volume, while the wetting front velocity in the other three was moderate. We, therefore, concluded, based on the water content/salinity effect on ER, that the measured preferential ER pathways coincide with preferential flow pathways. Salinity has, for the current case, a minor, if any, effect on the ER spatial variation. Therefore, ERT is an advantageous mean of mapping of preferential flow pathways in the soil profile, and the method developed herein can be used for studying the water distribution in the soil profile. Particular irrigation design and management can be then used to ease the negative effects of preferential flow pathways on soil water availability to plant roots and the enhanced leaching of agrochemical below the active root zone.

AB Groundwater is the most important water resource in arid regions. However, the groundwater traditional models and field measurements are limited due to the fluctuations in hydrological cycles and the difficulty in the accurate quantification of associated parameters. Here, we hypothesized that maximum potential tree height could be used to predict groundwater depth due to the hydraulic limitation of water transportation. To address this hypothesis, we measured two proxy indicators of maximum potential tree height, i.e, the maxima of heights and volumes, of three common dominant tree species in northwest China to construct classical measurement error (CME) model for predicting groundwater depth in an arid region. Our results showed that the optimal model based on maximum tree height had the best predictive performance of groundwater depth, particularly the tallest plant species. The CME model showed that maximum tree height played a vital role in predicting groundwater depth. Mathematically the model can be expressed as: [E(ln(Dw)vertical bar ln(Th), theta) = 7.11 - 1.85E (x vertical bar ln(Th), theta), where Dw and Th are respectively the theoretical values of groundwater depth and maximum tree height; xis the measured maximum tree height; theta = {7.11, -1.85, 7.19, 0.15, 1.91, 13.45}; R-2 = 0.82; Marginal log-Likelihood = -131.04; RMSE = 0.33]. In addition, Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation together with correlation analysis indicated that groundwater depth prediction based on maximum tree height in arid regions was an accurate and promising approach. In conclusion, our study showed that the hydraulic limitation of water transportation led to a negative relationship between maximum tree height and groundwater depth. Our developed model for predicting groundwater depth with maximum tree height has provided the important basis for the conservation and management of groundwater resources in arid regions.

AB A decrease in soil water content (SWC) has been observed at the global scale and has led to a reduction in evapotranspiration (ET). However, the trend in SWC in eastern Asia differed from the global trend, and this may be due to the overlapping of warm/wet seasons. Because of the limitation of deep soil water content data, especially in drylands, changes in SWC and the correlation between SWC (particularly deep SWC) and ET remain poorly understood. In this study, spatial distribution of correlation coefficient (r) between SWC and ET were calculated based on reanalysis data and remote sensing data, which were validated by in situ data (2004-2005) and sampling data (2016-2017). Firstly, the correlation between SWC and ET decreased with soil depth. The depth of the sharp decrease was 10 cm based on in situ monitoring data (2005-2008) and spatial sampling data (2016-2017). Secondly, the spatial correlation between SWC and ET varied with different vegetation cover types. The correlation increased from the western typical steppe to the eastern forest. The highest values of r were in a forest-covered area, because it had the highest water uptake capacity. However, the difference between r_10 and r_100 (D_r) showed a different spatial pattern, and the lowest negative D_r value was obtained from a forest-grass transition zone in which the enhanced vegetation index showed a significant increasing trend. The significant negative regression determination coefficient (R-2 = 0.9, p < 0.01) between B_(EVI) (0-0.1) and D_r indicated that the narrowed D_r in the transition zone was due to the vegetation increase. This meant that more deep soil water was taken up into the atmosphere. Thus, the deep SWC could become unstable and deep soil could become drier, which would be unsustainable for the ecosystem.

AB Rain-derived Inflow and rain-induced infiltration (RDI and RII) is a serious problem in urban drainage systems. Cost-effective and simplified RDI and RII estimation methods have been developed such as the conductivity based method, nonetheless the parameter uncertainty had seldomly been analyzed. In this paper, an uncertainty analysis was proposed for a pollutant-hydrograph model developed for assessing RDII based on wastewater conductivity. The uncertainty and sensitivity of model parameters were analyzed using the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) method. Different model scenarios including rainfall types, rainfall events, and different sewer systems were simulated in this model. The model results indicate the confidence of inflow and infiltration rate (Ran,, Ran) in residential area is much higher than that in the pump stations and WWTPs. The distribution disparity of RRDI and RRII also reflects the physical characteristic of the sewer network, which can be used to analyze sewer conditions such as pipe damages and misconnections. This novel conductivity-based method shows its improved performance compared to the traditional flow-based methods with supportive RDII data.

AB River confluences are pivotal junctions that have vital influences on hydraulic characteristics and sediment particle distributions as well as on hyporheic water exchange. However, hyporheic water exchange is poorly understood because of the complicated river morphology within a river confluence. Therefore, the river confluence between the Juehe River and Haohe River located in arid and semi-arid areas of northwestern China was selected to evaluate the hyporheic water exchange processes, and the temperatures of different depth sediment were measured on July 11th and 12th, 2016 by an instrument equipped with five temperature sensors. The patterns and magnitudes of hyporheic water exchange were estimated using a one-dimensional heat transport model coupled with temperature data. Meanwhile, terrain points elevations and sediment particle distributions in this river confluence were collected to determine the confluence riverbed morphology. Furthermore, the river confluence morphology effects on hyporheic water exchange were investigated in this study. The different riverbed morphology and hydrodynamic zone locations were observed, which were controlled by the planform geometry with low river confluence flux momentum during the test period. Meanwhile, the upwelling flow dominated in the test area, and the downwelling occurred at three of the 23 total test points, which was induced by the complicated riverbed morphology and hydraulic characteristics. Additionally, the magnitudes of the upwelling flow were significantly influenced by the sediment heterogeneity subjected to the erosional and depositional processes. Hyporheic water exchange is a vital hydrological process in arid and semi-arid areas, where it significantly impacts the ecological environment of rivers. This study provides a valuable guideline for water quality and quantity management in arid and semi-arid areas.

TI Implementing sustainable sanitation in an integrated model - A

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DE Sustainable sanitation; Decentralization; Stormwater management;

ID WATER MANAGEMENT; STRATEGIES
AB At present, increasing requirements for both the efficiency and environmental sustainability of resources demand more knowledge about the feasibility of the implementation of innovative technologies both in a large-scale as well as in the long run. Even at modified sewage flows and characterizations, water infrastructures must always remain reliable to guarantee sustainable urban water management. Dimensioning methods and assessment variables must be adapted to achieve more flexible systems in the long-term. This paper aims to assess the actual impact of the implementation of New Alternative Sanitation Systems (NASS) as well as stormwater decentralization measures in an existing sewage disposal system with means of a dynamic simulation within a 50-year time interval in 10 years steps. Two scenario simulations showed that the implementation of the module for blackwater and greywater separation with an assumed pollutant fractionation represents the investigated sustainable sanitation measures reliably. Results showed a decrease in the overflow discharge loads and duration of the control stormwater infrastructures. The WWTP showed a successful chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen elimination (TN) in all cases. Nonetheless, operational flexibility is fundamental in order to cope with the more unfavorable COD:TN ratios of the WWTP inflow after full implementation of NASS. To sum up, implementing this simplified approach for a stepwise implementation of resource-oriented sanitation technologies allows a dynamic integrated system evaluation not only for dry weather conditions but also for stormwater conditions.

AB Residence Times in aquifers result from their internal structure, from the hydrodynamic transport processes and from the recharge conditions to which they are exposed. Beyond the already known residence time distributions (RTD) for either constant aquifer thickness and/or uniform recharge, we investigate the effect of both distributed aquifer thickness and distributed recharge. We develop a semi-analytical approximation of the RTD for generic trapezoidal aquifers exposed to linearly-variable recharges. The solution is derived for a homogeneous 2D cross-sectional aquifer in steady-state conditions following the Dupuit-Forchheimer assumption according to which the vertical head gradients are much smaller than the horizontal head gradients. Close agreement with 2D numerical simulations demonstrates the relevance of the Dupuit-Forchheimer assumption to estimate RTDs as long as the aquifer thickness remains an order of magnitude smaller than the aquifer length. At equivalent aquifer volume, geometrical structure and recharge conditions result in non-trivial and complex RTD shapes that may be uniform, Gamma-like, power-law-like shapes as well as any intermediary shapes. The variety of RTD shapes encountered show the need to systematically include the aquifer structure and recharge conditions in the assessment of RTDs and for their subsequent use for problematics related to water quality. The semi-analytical approximation can be further used in a variety of aquifer systems in complement with other existing solutions as a Lumped Parameter Model for RTDs.

AB Water resources are essential for survival of both the ecosystem and human society in arid regions. The impact of precipitation on vegetation cover, especially in arid and semiarid areas, has received increasing interest. Although correlation between precipitation and vegetation cover has been reported in arid and semi-arid areas (with annual precipitation from 50 to 200 mm and from 200 to 400 mm, respectively), it is unclear whether the same correlation holds in extremely arid regions (with annual precipitation less than 50 mm). This study used remote sensing data of precipitation and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to investigate their correlation at different temporal and spatial scales in a typical arid mountain-oasis river system located in northwest China. The results showed that precipitation and NDVI are not evenly distributed in space. In the period 1999-2007, precipitation was declining at a rate of 1.1785 mm/year, while during 2008-2015, it has increased at a rate of 2.0516 mm/year. NDVI showed no significant temporal trend in most areas (trend slope = 0.001, Significance > 0.05), except for a slight increase in regions where cropland expanded. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the time series of spatial mean precipitation and NDVI over the whole study area was 0.46 (Significance < 0.01), suggesting strong effects of precipitation on NDVI in the study area. The correlation coefficient between precipitation and NDVI varied spatially with the precipitation pattern in space. Through analysis of phase difference in space and time, it was found that NDVI in the lower reaches of the river system was significantly correlated with accumulative precipitation of the current and previous two months in the upper reaches of the system. Our study shows that the impacts of precipitation on vegetation cover have a clear phase difference in space, and that in an extremely arid area, antecedent precipitation in an adjacent region upstream has strong influences on vegetation cover downstream. Thus, the spatial distribution and antecedent accumulation of precipitation impacts should be taken into consideration when analyzing vegetation dynamics in arid areas.

AB The importance of representing the spatial structure of rainfall accurately has been emphasized in various hydrological studies. It has also been widely acknowledged that there is a need to account for uncertainty in rainfall input. Common approaches focus on accounting for either point measurement or sampling uncertainty in rainfall estimation. We present a method that jointly considers three sources of uncertainty affecting the space-time mapping of rainfall: point measurement, sampling and neighborhood uncertainty. To our knowledge, neighborhood uncertainty has not been included in any prior rainfall uncertainty analysis. We generated an ensemble of 400 realizations of daily rainfall fields at a 2 km x 2 km spatial resolution for a catchment in Western Denmark (1055 km(2)). At the core of our method is the sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) technique. Results indicate that our approach is able to reproduce key statistical features of the rainfall distribution. We examined the impact of different spatial (grid and catchment) and temporal supports (one day, one month, 5-year period) on the overall uncertainty. We also quantified the effect of each uncertainty source on rainfall field uncertainty. Finally, we compared our simulation results with those of a parallel expert elicitation study. We found that the expert elicitation uncertainty for average catchment rainfall in a 5-year period was considerably larger than quantified in our study (CV of 1.1% vs. 5%). An even larger discrepancy was found for the 5-year average of gauge rainfall, where expert elicitation resulted in a value that was an order of magnitude higher (CV of 0.2% vs. 2%). Possible reasons for this gap are discussed.

AB Heterogeneities in textural properties of surficial formations at field scale result in spatial variations in hydraulic parameters governing unsaturated zone flow. This study aims at quantifying the influence of such variations on solute transport resulting from a localized source of radioactive contaminant at ground level.
   The study focuses on three hydraulic parameters related to the Mualem-van Genuchten formalism, namely the saturated hydraulic conductivity K-s, the parameter a inversely proportional to the air-entry value, and the parameter n related to the pore-size distribution. Sets of random fields accounting for spatial variability of these parameters are generated using lognormal distributions with different variances and correlation lengths. These random fields are used as inputs to an unsaturated flow and transport model to simulate radionuclide plume migration.
   Each simulated plume is characterized by its size (plume surface area), position (location of center of mass) and shape (elongation ratio) within the unsaturated zone. By comparison with the homogeneous medium, K-s-, alpha- and n-random fields generated with the mean variances computed through the analysis of a global soil database respectively result in average in (i) 25 (variable K-s), 20 (variable alpha) and 65% (variable n) increase in plume size; (ii) 0.8, 1 and 1.8 m horizontal offsets of the plume center; and (iii) 20, 30 and 50% decrease in plume circularity. In addition, changes in the variance values within one order of magnitude appear to have critical consequences only for the n parameter.
   The issue of spatial variability of hydraulic parameters is thus crucial for characterizing the evolution of pollutant plumes within an unsaturated zone and for developing better remediation strategies for industrial sites.

AB Remote sensing data are frequently incorporated into drought indices used widely by research and management communities to assess and diagnose current and historic drought events. The integrated drought indices combine multiple indicators and reflect drought conditions from a range of perspectives (i.e., hydrological, agricultural, meteorological). However, the success of most remote sensing based drought indices is constrained by geographic regions since their performance strongly depends on environmental factors such as land cover type, temperature, and soil moisture. To address this limitation, we propose a framework for a new integrated drought index that performs well across diverse climate regions. Our framework uses a geographically weighted regression model and principal component analysis to composite a range of vegetation and meteorological indices derived from multiple remote sensing platforms and in-situ drought indices developed from meteorological station data. Our new index, which we call the station-enabled Geographically Independent Integrated Drought Index (GIIDI_station), compared favorably with other common drought indices such as Microwave Integrated Drought Index (MIDI), Optimized Meteorological Drought Index (OMDI), Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI), and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). Using Pearson correlation analyses between remote sensing and in-situ drought indices during the growing season (April to October) from 2002 to 2011, we show that GlIDi_station had the best correlations with in-situ drought indices. Across the entire study region of the continental United States, the performance of GIIDI_station was not affected by common environmental factors such as precipitation, temperature, land cover and soil conditions. Taken together, our results suggest that GlIDLstation has considerable potential to improve our ability of monitoring drought at regional scales, provided local meteorological station data are available.

AB Many semi-arid regions of the world experience rainfall patterns characterized by high spatial variability. Accurate spatial representation of different types of rainfall will facilitate the application of distributed hydrological models in these areas. This study presents a daily, spatially distributed, stochastic rainfall generator based on a first-order Markov chain model, calibrated using 50 years of rainfall observations at 88 gages from 1967 through 2016 in the 148-km(2) Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed. Three types of rainfall, including convective, frontal, and tropical depression storms, were simulated separately in the generator using biweekly parameterization. Convective storms were simulated based on an elliptical shape rain cell conceptual model, whereas frontal and tropical depression storms were simulated as uniform rainfall fields over the whole watershed with introduced random variability. The rainfall generator was evaluated by comparing the mean statistics of 30 sets of 50-year simulated data versus the 50-year rain gage observed data. Most individual storm statistics and aggregated seasonal rainfall statistics were similar to the measured rainfall observations. The long-term mean values of both summer and winter rainfall amount were statistically satisfactory. This model can serve as a guide for application in areas with convective, frontal, and tropical depression storms.

AB In order to advance our understanding of the driving factors controlling carbon dynamics and evolution of water quality in river-reservoir systems for the generation of hydropower, we conducted a study in a karst deep-water reservoir (Wujiangdu Reservoir), southwest China. Water samples were collected from the inflow/outflow of the Wujiangdu Reservoir, four vertical columns along the reservoir, and from three tributaries to the reservoir in January, April, July, and October 2017. The dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations and carbon isotope composition (delta C-13(DIC)) varied greatly (1.99-3.45 mmol/L and -10.7 parts per thousand to -6.0 parts per thousand, respectively) and were controlled by multiple processes including CO2 outgassing, primary production, and organic matter degradation. In the four vertical profiles, the difference between the values of samples with those at 15 m of Delta[DIC] and Delta[delta C-13(DIC)], Delta[DIC] and Delta Ca2+ in the same water column had positive correlations, and the variation in dissolved O-2, partial pressure of CO2, and flux of CO2 suggested that primary production dominated above the epilimnion and degradation of OM dominated below the epilimnion during the warm season. Continuous CO2 outgassing was found from riverine water to surface water of the reservoir before the dam based on carbon isotopic compositions and water chemistry. These processes would cause isotopic fractionation between the residual DIC and CO2 (aqueous), the degree of which varied among different seasons (July > April > October > January). Carbon transport and biogeochemical processes were highly controlled by the hydraulic retention time (HRT) in the river-reservoir system. It was estimated that approximately 71.5% of the annual DIC flux was produced in the water column below 15 m depth during the study year, suggesting that the processes of DIC generation and consumption occurred at the same time. The results highlight that carbon behavior in the impounded rivers is influenced by multiple processes. The carbon transformation processes should be taken into account for improving the estimation accuracy of the carbon budget calculations and the management of water quality for river-reservoir systems.

AB Lateral seepage can be an important water loss pathway at the field level and a conduit for the discharge of pesticides and nutrients from rice fields. However, few studies have directly measured lateral seepage rates in flooded rice fields. This study sought to characterize the magnitude and variability of lateral seepage in California rice fields, and to explore the relationship between lateral seepage and soil properties or hydrologic conditions. Lateral seepage was measured during the growing season at 50 locations spread across six rice fields using a methodology that operates analogously to a double-ring infiltrometer. Lateral seepage rates varied over four orders of magnitude (0.05-33.11 cm(2) h(-1) or 0.0011-1.05 cm h(-1)), though even the highest rate measured was small compared to typical water inputs in California rice fields, and lateral seepage corresponded to only 1.0%-1.9% of water inputs at sites where irrigation inputs were measured. Lateral seepage was negatively correlated with levee width (p = 0.025) and the relative water height in the adjacent field, supply canal, or drainage ditch (p = 0.045), though this relationship explained little of the variation in lateral seepage rates (marginal r(2) = 0.129). Contrary to expectations, not all supply canals or higher flooded fields were a source for lateral seepage into fields, as unsaturated zones present in most levees served as a sink for lateral seepage from both sides of the levee. Future research should examine the prevalence of preferential flow pathways in rice field levees and the potential for transport of nutrients or agrochemicals through these flow pathways.

AB The changes of soil properties caused by ecosystem restoration have played critical roles in controlling water and sediment loss in Loess Plateau. However, it is difficult to isolate and quantify the individual impact of each factor as the impact is hard to monitor separately. The objectives of this study are to explore how the changes in different soil properties influence the hydrologic response and sediment transport at catchment scale. We applied a coupled hydrologic-sediment transport model to a small catchment in the Loess Plateau. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on three influential soil properties: saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), Manning's roughness coefficient (n) and the variations of erodibility coefficient (phi). Our results indicated that the increase in near surface saturated hydraulic conductivity could effectively reduce the peak and total flow (i.e. when Ks is smaller than rainfall intensity, 22.5% increase in Ks leads to over 70% reduction in total discharge), and could lead to transition of runoff generation mechanism from Horton Overland Flow to Dunne Overland Flow. The increase in Manning's roughness coefficient would also reduce the discharge and sediment yield substantially by slowing down the flow velocity which leads to more infiltration along the flow path after the runoff is generated. The decrease in erodibility coefficient reduces the sediment rate and total sediment mass delivered (i.e. 20% decrease can reduce total sediment mass by 5%), alleviating the undercutting in upstream gullies and deposition at downstream, eventually slowing down landscape evolution. Our findings could be used to provide valuable guidance in the ecosystem restoration and land use management.

AB The coordination of social economy, water, and ecology is an important foundation for sustainable development. However, the interaction among social economy, water, and ecology are complex. The data scales between socioeconomic factors (normally at the spatial scale of the administrative region and the temporal scale of a year or month) and river water quality and ecological factors (normally at the spatial scale of a sub-basin and the temporal scale of an instantaneous value) do not match. Therefore, many current regulation methods do not sufficiently consider the interaction mechanisms between socioeconomic, water, and ecological factors or cannot adequately deal with the scale of the data. In this study, we proposed a new framework to assess the coordinated development of social economy, water, and ecology (SWE) by integrating the distributed social economy-water ecological model (SEWE) and the harmonious regulation model. We built the SEWE model by coupling a rainfall runoff model, river water quality, and ecological models; we built the harmonious regulation model based on the harmony theory method. We applied the proposed method and framework to the Shaying River Basin, which exhibited typical characteristics of multiple sluices and dams, high pollution, and significant human activities. Results indicated that the coordinated development level of the SWE in the Shaying River Basin was poor, with the average coordination degree varying from 0.39 to 0.60. The average growth rate of the coordination degree of socioeconomic indicators was greater than that of the river water quality and ecological indicators. The coordination degree of water ecological indicators was small with a decreasing trend. These results indicated the increasing impact of socioeconomic development on river water quality and ecology. Therefore, the Shaying River Basin should focus on ecological and environmental restoration, such as the effective control of pollution draining into rivers. The proposed methods and framework could contribute to the integrated water resource management of the basin.

AB Agriculture accounts for 90% of global freshwater consumption and it is expected to intensify in the future. Climate and land use changes are two major factors affecting crop green and blue water consumption, and in this study we explicitly consider the effects of both factors in a consistent modeling framework. Two important research questions are addressed: 1) How will global crop green and blue water consumption evolve over the 21st century under climate and land use changes; and 2) what are the individual and combined effects of climate and land use changes on future crop green and blue water consumption? To tackle these two questions, a crop water use module is developed based on the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) and its hydrology module (i.e., Xanthos). Crop specific green and blue water consumption are then calculated at global 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees grid scale. Results show that global crop green water consumption increases by 12% in 2090s when compared with that in 1971-2000, and climate change dominates over land use change in determining the trend of global crop green water consumption. However, expansion in global irrigated area dominates the changing trend of global crop blue water consumption which increases 70% by 2090s, especially in regions with significant irrigated land expansion (e.g. northern Africa, central Asia, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia, southern Asia, and Argentina). Furthermore, global crop blue water dependence will increase under climate and land use changes, especially in arid regions.

AB Reservoir operation plays an important role in the coevolution of the nexus across water supply, power generation, and environment (WPE) systems. This paper aims to contribute to the state-of-the-art in how multi objective reservoir operation can be modeled within the framework of the WPE nexus by incorporating the interactions among reservoirs operation, stakeholders' decision preferences, and WPE systems. Specifically, five ordinary differential equations are used to describe the dynamics of WPE states. These dynamics are driven by a multi-objective optimization model that optimizes reservoir operation decisions. Two novel response linkages that describe how the reservoir operational decisions influence socio-economic variables and how the environmental awareness influences stakeholders' preference for reservoir operation are proposed in this study. The Middle Route of China's South-to-North Water Transfer Project is selected as the case study. The results show that: (1) response linkages are effective in describing the interactions between reservoir operational decisions and WPE systems, (2) tradeoffs across WPE systems and reservoir operational decisions shift from stage to stage because of the changing socio-economic conditions, and (3) the control parameter that dominates the shift in stable levels of a given variable can be identified. These results highlight the importance of re-evaluating involved tradeoff effects and updating of operational policies periodically, and how our modeling approach can be used to detect and guide such adaptions.

AB A number of past studies have investigated the influence of various teleconnections - such as El Nino-Southem Oscillation (ENSO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) - on precipitation and streamflow. These studies, however, have not focused on analyzing the combined influence of the different phases of these teleconnections and the simultaneous influence of these teleconnections at differing time-frequency scales. The present study addresses this issue by exploring the use of wavelet-based methods in combination with non-parametric approaches to analyze individual and combined influences involving ENSO, NAO, and PDO on monthly precipitation and streamflow data from watersheds in Alberta, Ontario, and Newfoundland, in Canada.
   This study is the first time that multiscale and multivariate analyses of ENSO, NAO, and PDO, along with their different phases, are used to explain the variability of streamflow and precipitation in a watershed. Generally, the positive and negative phases (particularly of ENSO and NAO) were respectively associated with lower and higher precipitation/streamflow, while the neutral phase showed similar behavior to that of the negative phase. The results of the bivariate and multivariate wavelet coherences revealed that there were consistent increases in the average wavelet coherence (AWC) and the percentage of significant coherence (PoSP) for all watersheds, from using only one factor to two and three teleconnection factors. The ranges of AWC for one, two and three factors were 0.31-0.40, 0.56-0.66, and 0.77-0.81, respectively. The ranges of PoSP for one, two and three factors were 3.54-14.3, 28.38-47.29, and 69.28-76.71, respectively. This implies that three-factor combinations (ENSO-NAO-PDO) were needed to explain the variability of precipitation and streamflow in all watersheds.

AB To better understand the effects of climate change on streamflow, the hydrologic response to both temperature and precipitation needs to be examined at the mesoscale. New York State provides a hydrologically diverse mesoscale region, where sub-regional clusters of watersheds may respond differently to changes in temperature and in seasonal precipitation rates. Connections between streamflow and climate were examined for 97 gaging stations across the state and surrounding areas, for a historical period of 56 years of daily average streamflow. Gages were grouped into clusters if their mean annual discharge rates were strongly correlated to one another. Within each cluster, sharp temporal changes in discharge, or change points, were identified. These change points clustered both spatially and by flow regime, with low, medium, and high flows increasing around 1970 for much of the state consistent with other studies in the region. A step increase in Catskill low flows in 2003 coincides with increases in summer precipitation, and is consistent with a positive correlation between summer precipitation and annual low flows. Our results support previous studies that have shown that streamflow at this mesoscale is strongly tied to precipitation, and the strength of that connection is modulated by land cover, geographic position, and seasonal moisture conditions. Across the state, the winter-spring center of volume date has moved earlier along with increasing January streamflow rates, the result of warmer winter temperatures and an increased proportion of precipitation as rain. The transition to a post-1970s pluvial period also coincided with more frequent peak over threshold flows statewide, and this wetter period has continued to the present day.

AB Changes in vegetation growth may influence the availability of water resources. Located on the Tibetan Plateau, the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin (YZRB) is a major freshwater source for Tibet, China and downstream South Asian countries, with high spatial heterogeneity in altitude and climate from the upstream to downstream regions. In this study, we combined satellite-based gridded datasets of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), topography, precipitation, and temperature to investigate how vegetation growth has changed in the YZRB over recent decades (1982-2010), and to determine their driving mechanisms. Although a statistically significant trend in growing season NDVI was not detected at the basin scale, at the pixel scale 16.8% and 5.3% of the area of the YZRB was found to exhibit increasing and decreasing trends, respectively. The greatest increases occurred in the Nyang subbasin. Variations of NDVI values along elevation, precipitation, and temperature gradients revealed the greatest variation over the middle ranges of the three variables. Partial correlation analyses indicate that in both arid and semi-arid regions of the YZRB precipitation is positively correlated with NDVI. The relationship between NDVI and temperature varies with aridity, reflecting different effects of snow-melting processes on vegetation growth. Temperature positively correlates with NDVI in the arid region. In addition, a negative correlation between NDVI and temperature is detected in the semi-arid region. This is the first comprehensive study to explore climate-vegetation-hydrology relationships in the YZRB at a spatial resolution finer than those derived from sparse in-situ meteorological stations or low resolution global climate datasets. Our results are valuable for understanding ecohydrological processes in both arid and semi-arid regions of this internationally important river basin.

AB Fluorosis is an endemic disease that is now a global challenge. In this review paper we have classified and described the global fluoride belts (GFB) geologically and geographically connecting different countries. A proper map of the global fluoride belts showing the inland connections between each belt is presented. Several natural factors like the rock type, soil, tectonics, hydrogeology and climate of a terrain which are majorly responsible for engrafting higher fluoride in drinking water are described. A detailed uniform description of each belts with respect to geology, geochemistry are discussed. The minor factors like altitude, phosphate mining etc. on fluorosis are also discussed including countries like Canada, Norway etc. which are potentially affected by fluorosis. The correlation of different ions like Cl-, Ca2+, etc; pH, electrical conductivity, TDS etc are compared and reviewed in detailed with respect to different GFB. The genesis and sources of fluoride contamination are also supported by different isotopic evidences. In this article, the in situ methods involving natural minerals and materials which can adsorb fluoride effectively and are being used globally are exhaustively assessed. The methods which are highly sustainable with minimum waste generation and cost effective are also evaluated.

AB Reservoir inflow estimation is important in flood control operation. Reservoir inflow includes three components, namely, upstream, tributary, and lateral inflow. However, the lateral inflow, which has a significant contribution to reservoir inflow during flood seasons, is difficult to estimate in regions where precipitation or meteorological data are lacking. A reverse model based on the adjoint equation method (AEM) was proposed to improve the estimated accuracy of reservoir inflow without using rainfall data. The model inverted the lateral inflow on the basis of observed hydraulic characteristic data, such as water levels and discharges. The AEM, which is considered an optimization method, determines the optimal lateral inflow by minimizing misfits between the observed and simulated data. The capability of the AEM was verified by two synthetic examples with varied boundary conditions. After running the forward model to solve one-dimensional Saint-Venant equations, the resulting water level hydrographs were used as known observations for the inversion. The practical applicability was tested by reproducing a historical flood event of the Three Gorges Reservoir by using water level data and outflow hydrograph. Results demonstrated that the AEM could successfully invert lateral and reservoir inflows by using observed data and has practical applicability in complicated reservoirs.

AB Soil hydraulic properties play a primary role in water infiltration and movement, and transport of nutrients and contaminants through the soil profile. However, the determination of soil hydraulic properties, especially the hydraulic conductivity at lower depths within the soil profile is very challenging. We investigated the use of inverse modelling based on APSIM (Agricultural Production Simulation Model) to determine likely ranges of the hydraulic conductivity at saturation (K-sat) and field capacity (K-DUL) for a slowly permeable subsurface horizon. Simulations were run for the poorly drained Otokia silt loam, in the Otago region of New Zealand. APSIM simulations were set up either according to the site specific soil profile description or based on the national soils database (S-map) pedotransfer functions. Simulated temporal soil moisture data were compared to measurements from a field experiment. Within a sensitivity analysis K-sat values of the subsurface soil were varied from 2.4 to 192 mm/d, and values for K-DUL from 0.05 to 1 mm/d. Finally simulations were run over 45 years using three climatic conditions, with annual rainfall amounts of 582, 628 and 730 mm. The effect of varying the hydraulic conductivity of the subsurface fragipan horizon (C-x) on the wetness status of the overlying B-2g horizon was determined by calculating the average annual duration of soil moisture above field capacity. These were then used to estimate ranges of the hydraulic conductivity that contributes to a soil being imperfectly or poorly drained. The results highlight the significant influence that K-DUL, has on the reliability of modelling the hydraulic behaviour of soils with slowly permeable subsoils.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) plays an important role in determining the available water resources of a basin. In past decades, the Heihe River basin (HRB) in Northwest China has suffered severe water crisis and ecological problems due to large land cover changes (LCCs), especially oases expansion for irrigation agriculture. This study quantifies the ET variations due to LCCs in the HRB from 2000 to 2015 using the Ecological Assimilation of Land and Climate Observations (EALCO) model and detailed LCC measurements. Large variations in ET with land cover type is seen in the HRB. In the past fifteen years, crop expansion from bare soil or desert grass caused most of the increase in ET, while the conversion of alpine grass to desert grass caused most of the decrease in ET. As a result, a net 1.03 billion m(3) of increased water consumption per year resulted from the overall LCCs in the HRB. This increased water use for ET largely intensified the water crisis in the HRB and deteriorated the health of the downstream ecosystems. Our results show that the water consumed in crop expansion can be used to recover almost ten times the area of the degraded desert grass ecosystem. A stricter policy that limits agriculture expansion is recommended in land use planning for a sustainable ecosystem development in the basin. This study also helps to better understand ET changes from LCCs and manage the limited water resources for sustainable ecosystem development in other arid regions of the world.

AB Riparian zones adjacent to revetments, as the last position of the entire riparian, are the last barrier to intercept runoff nitrogen pollution. They are also the areas where hyporheic exchange occurs when soil is submerged by river water. Revetments can be classified into impervious revetments and permeable revetments according to their permeability. It has been realized that impervious revetments are not conducive to exchange between rivers and riparian zones. Tidal riparian zones undergo water level changes more frequently than normal riparian zones. Thus, revetments in tidal riparian zones may have a greater impact on nitrogen cycling. However, the quantitative influence of revetment types on nitrogen removal in adjacent tidal urban riparian zones is not clear, resulting in the lack of scientific support for the revetments construction. Removal of nitrogen from riparian zones primarily occurs through plant uptake, microbial immobilization, and denitrification. However, nitrogen will be released into soil again after plants die or microorganisms decompose. While denitrification can completely remove nitrogen through transferring nitrate (NO3-) into gaseous nitrous oxide (N2O) and dinitrogen (N-2). In this study, we used three revetment types (permeable concrete pile revetments (PR), impervious masonry stone revetments (IR), and no revetments (NR)) as examples to quantify the effects of revetment types on soil denitrification in adjacent tidal urban riparian zones at three distances from the revetments (0.3 m, 0.6 m, 1.0 m) by measuring the soil (0-20 cm) denitrification potential (DP) and N2O production rates (N2OR). Results indicated that compared with soil denitrification (0.32 +/- 0.06 mg kg(-1)h(-1)) in natural riparian zones (NR), PR could significantly improve it (0.97 +/- 0.07 mg kg(-1)h(-1)), while IR significantly inhibited it (0.23 +/- 0.04 mg kg(-1)h(-1)) in the adjacent tidal urban riparian zones (P < 0.01). Changes in soil properties caused by revetment types accounted for the differences in soil denitrification. Soil organic carbon (SOC) was a main direct chemical factor, and soil texture was a main indirect physical factor. Based on these results, revetments construction did not necessarily inhibit soil denitrification in natural riparian zones, and priority should be given to building permeable revetments to improve the soil denitrification provided by the riparian ecosystem.

AB Growing demand for biomass-derived fuels has resulted in an increase in bioenergy projects in recent years, a trend that is expected to continue. However, broad expansion of bioenergy feedstock production may have significant environmental consequences. Accordingly, the goal of this study is to investigate how forest-based bioenergy development may affect hydrological systems at the watershed scale. Specifically, this study addresses hybrid poplar cultivation for biofuel production in a snow-dominated watershed in northern Wisconsin, USA. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), calibrated and validated for streamflow and biomass production cycles, is used to evaluate the effects of land use change corresponding to a range of biofuel development scenarios. The biofuel scenarios follow physically-based rules for land use conversion to poplar plantations from hay, pasture, and forested lands; along with a suite of alternative management practices, including rotation time, planting density, fertilizer application and irrigation. Trade-offs between biomass production, fertilizer use, and hydrologic alteration are evaluated for the feedstock production system. The highest density (1111 trees/100 m(2)) and shortest rotation (5-year) treatments produce the highest biomass and are the most efficient treatments in terms of water and fertilizer use per ton of biomass. The high efficiency is due to optimal relationships between leaf area index, biomass production, and N uptake. At annual or greater time scales, the simulated conversion to poplar had minimal effect on ET and streamflows. However, in summer months, the ET from the poplar substantially exceeds that of the original land use, so that streamflows decrease by as much as 50%. Irrigation to meet soil water deficits increased biomass production, but only by 4% on average, which is not surprising for a temperate, humid watershed.

AB Aquatic carbon (C) loss is mostly driven by in-situ mineralization of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and leads to autonomous carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the atmosphere. However, limited studies have examined the biodegradability of riverine DOC, especially for the initial trophic controls of DOC biodegradation (%BDOC) and variations in dissolved organic matter (DOM) chemical composition. In this study, we employed a laboratory incubation experiment to determine the riverine %BDOC, temperature sensitivity (Q(10) value), nutrients and DOM optical properties in a subtropical river in the Dry-hot Valley Region. We observed the %BDOC at 30 degrees C (52 +/- 19.8%) was significantly higher than that at 20 degrees C (34 19.9%) with an average Qio value of 2 +/- 1.7. Decreases in a(254), a(350) values indicated that the aromatic and lignin fractions were decomposed, while increases in E2:E3 and decreases in E4:46 values suggested that large molecular DOMs were incompletely degraded and accumulated after 56-day incubations. The %BDOC was negatively correlated with the DOC:TDP ratio, which suggested that P availability was a dominant control in aquatic microbial respiration. Our results conclude that temperature and trophic status regulate biodegradability of DOC, and also stimulate the incomplete degradation of recalcitrant fraction in DOMs.

AB Analytical solutions of groundwater dynamics in an elongated aquifer subjected to general time-dependent recharge are presented. The lateral boundaries are specified heads with the head variations governed by general time-dependent functions. General recharge function was not considered in previous works of this kind. Both single and double-porosity aquifers are considered. The solution is obtained using Fourier sine and Laplace transformations, followed by an inverse Fourier-Laplace transform involving residue theorem and convolutional integral. For the unconfined single-porosity aquifer case, the exact time-domain solution is obtained using the residue theorem; for the unconfined double-porosity aquifer case, the time-domain head is calculated using the de Hoog inverse Laplace algorithm. The presented solution can be used to estimate the hydraulic parameters of 1) groundwater head variation of a river basin aquifer subjected to general lateral head variation and recharge; 2) groundwater head variation in a double-porosity elongated fractured anticline; 3) groundwater depletion of an elongated fractured anticline subjected to recharge due to rainfall or snowmelt to its adjacent alluvial aquifer. In addition, the presented solution can be utilized to optimize the irrigation pattern in a cropland between two trench drains to control the groundwater mound.

Creating a range of essential data from digital database repositories aids the development of decision support tools for urban planners in a simulation of different urban drainage scheme scenarios and moderates the interference with other infrastructure utilities. These tools, modelled with design software and GIS platform, are tested in two case studies; the results revealing essential improvements in accuracy of output, time taken to prepare and run the model and model presentation which visualised the hydraulic design results and global location of the drainage layout on an urban master plan.

AB Glaciers in the upper Indus supply more than half of the river water, are experiencing significant melting with a debated fate. The recent melting rate is still contained by considerable uncertainties, hindering to estimate precise glacier mass change. Here we present geodetic mass balance results for the whole Indus Basin using SRTM and ALOS 30 m elevation data, improved glacier inventory, optimized glacier surface density, and validation through in-situ differential GPS and ICESat data. Our glacier inventory and derived by improving RGI6.0 boundaries and separated into debris cover and debris free parts. The derived surface elevation changes were converted into annual mass balances using separated density assumptions (four criteria) for debris-covered ice (900 +/- 60 kg m(-3)), debris-free ice (below 20 degrees and 25 degrees slopes (850 +/- 60 kg m(-3)) and above 20 degrees and 25 degrees slopes (600 +/- 60 kg m(-3))), respectively. The resulting mass balance biased between -0.20 and 0.09 m water equivalent (w.e.) a(-1) using an average (850 +/- 60 kg m(-3)) density assumption throughout the Indus Basin. In the western Himalaya and Hindu Kush, the glacier mass losses are less affected by the average density assumption compared to the Karakoram. The western (Hunza) and central (Shigar) Karakoram glaciers show negligible mass losses of -0.02 +/- 0.12 and -0.01 +/- 0.13 m w.e. a(-1) in contrast to the relatively more negative mass balance (-0.26 +/- 0.21 m w.e. a(-1)) in the eastern (Shyok) Karakoram. All the sub-basins exhibit negative mass balances, with the most negative values ranging from -0.34 +/- 0.31 to 0.44 +/- 0.27 m w.e. a(-1) in the Ravi, Chenab and Jhelum sub-basins of the Himalaya. The whole Indus Basin contributes approximately +0.014 +/- 0.016 mm a(-1) to the global mean sea-level equivalent.

AB Groundwater dating information is important for safety assessment for geological disposal of high-level radioactive waste. Radiokrypton (Kr-81) is an excellent tracer for dating old groundwater with a residence time up to 1 Ma. We have optimized a hollow-fiber-based device for extracting Kr-81 from deep groundwater with low hydraulic conductivity for the purpose of estimating its residence time. Such a device must show a high Kr extraction efficiency and an ultra-low level of contamination from modern air and must allow for in situ evaluation of Kr extraction efficiency. The optimal devices reported herein showed minimal contamination by Kr-81 from modern air, and the efficiency of Kr extraction from high-salinity groundwater exceeded 90%. Furthermore, we confirmed that the Rn-222 was a suitable indicator of Kr extraction efficiency.

AB The 2015 Chennai (India) flood event claimed many lives and incurred an economic loss of $2.2 billion. Simulation of such a destructive flood event in an ever growing urban sprawl and changing climate is of great importance for better flood preparedness and management of the city. In that light, this study aims to (a) study the 2015 Chennai flood event and (b) simulate the occurrence of a similar event in future, considering both urban sprawl and increased rainfall resulting from climate change effects. The baseline scenario is generated using freely available hydrologic (HEC-HMS)-hydraulic (HEC-RAS) models and the results are validated with observed flood-mark data. Historical land use and land cover maps of the study area are used to train an Artificial Neural Network model for constructing spatially varying urban sprawl scenarios. The hydrologic model is run for the increased rainfall and urban sprawl scenarios to generate flood hydrographs, which are then used as inputs to the hydraulic model for simulating possible flood inundation patterns. The simulations indicate that the average increase in inundation extent considering the worst possible urban sprawl solely, and that taken together with extreme rainfall, are 20 and 33 percent, respectively. Furthermore, the analysis shows that on an average 1.7 times more number of buildings are exposed to flood hazard under the worst case combined scenario in comparison to the baseline scenario. This study, therefore, demonstrates the importance of considering urban sprawl, in addition to changes in rainfall, for evaluating the worst possible consequences of flooding of a city. Considering the uncertainties involved in the study, the presented results may be considered as "what-if' scenarios for planning suitable flood mitigation measures for the city of Chennai.

AB The agro-hydrological Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant-WOrld-FOod-STudy (SWAP-WOFOST) model in a distributed manner represents an important tool for evaluating agro-hydrological cycles and irrigation strategies at different spatiotemporal scales. The reliability of the model simulations and evaluations is dependent on the generation of the distributed simulation units that account for the spatial heterogeneity of various factors, as well as parameter calibration and model validation. In this study, we focused on the most typical overexploited deep groundwater area in the North China Plain (NCP). First, the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (EFAST) was used to conduct global sensitivity analyses for three modules in the SWAP-WOFOST model to identify the parameters that significantly influence the objective variables for calibration at the six experimental stations in the study area. On this basis, the parameters were calibrated and validated in detail using abundant observed data from each station. The normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) values for soil water content, soil salt concentration, winter wheat leaf area index (LAI), winter wheat aboveground biomass, winter wheat yield, summer maize LAI, summer maize aboveground biomass and summer maize yield were 14.93%, 27.20%, 24.60%, 25.27%, 23.12%, 24.55%, 21.33% and 17.94%, respectively, during the calibration period; and the corresponding NRMSE values were 16.26%, 29.36%, 24.20%, 22.75%, 21.77%, 22.03%, 24.38% and 18.62%, respectively, during the validation period. The model provided a good simulation for the soil water contents and summer maize yields and a fair simulation for the other objective variables. Furthermore, a distributed SWAP-WOFOST model was generated by overlaying 12 maps involving meteorology, soil, crops, land use, water resources and administrative divisions, yielding 2809 simulation units. Finally, the simulation accuracy of the distributed model was evaluated under the current irrigation conditions. The results showed that the simulated yields of winter wheat and summer maize were consistent with the statistical values, and the simulated evapotranspiration matched the remote sensing data with acceptable precision. In summary, the distributed SWAP-WOFOST model could be used as an effective tool for simulating crop water productivity in time and space under limited irrigation scenarios and for evaluating the effect of optimized limited irrigation schemes on reducing deep groundwater exploitation in this region.

AB Determination of electrical conductivity of soil pore-water from measurements of soil bulk electrical conductivity and volumetric water content or dielectric permittivity, requires theoretical or empirical models connecting these quantities. One such model is the salinity index model, which in the original formulation requires the measurement of soil bulk electrical conductivity and apparent dielectric permittivity determined with the time-domain-reflectometry (TDR) technique. Currently, many popular soil moisture sensors are operated at a single frequency, usually in the low-frequency part of the typical TDR bandwidth. Yet, no systematic verification of the salinity index model applied with the use of dielectric permittivity measured at specific frequencies in a broad frequency range has been performed. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the salinity index model with the use of dielectric spectra of 277 samples of 14 soils obtained in a 20 MHz-3 GHz frequency range with the use of a coaxial transmission-line cell vector-network-analyzer system. A three-pole Debye model was fitted to the spectra in order to determine bulk electrical conductivity and the real part of dielectric permittivity at chosen frequencies in order to diminish the influence of measurement errors. Then, the salinity index model was applied at each examined frequency and its soil-specific parameters were calculated. The performance of the model was evaluated with the use of the leave-one-out cross-validation scheme, and the frequencies at which the model performed best were found within 0.5-2 GHz range. Finally, the salinity index model parameters obtained at the optimal frequencies were correlated with other soil properties.

AB Increasing water demand aggravates water scarcity in water-scarce regions (e.g., India, Pakistan, and China), where uneven precipitation increases the risk of maintaining sustainable eco-economic development. Ignoring precipitation's effects leads to misguided policy recommendations that either deplete or underuse basin water resources. Therefore, this paper highlights the concept of uneven precipitation and uncertain stream inflow based on scenario analysis. Within a river basin, the regional authority and subarea managers both have water allocation and reallocation privileges. Motivated by sustainable development of water resource management systems, we argue that regional authorities should focus on alleviating the contradiction between supply and demand, and then seeking an optimum allocation strategy to ensure societal and economic benefits for its subareas, from which the subareas cart provide reasonable reaction strategies. Authorities dominate water transactions between subareas involved in water rights distribution. This paper proposes a multi-objective multistage Stackelberg-Nash-Cournot (m(2)SNC) game model to cope with conflicts between regional authorities and subarea managers concerning multiple activities. An interactive-dynamic-programming-based genetic algorithm (IDP-GA) is designed to simulate the policies needed for the optimum allocation of water resources under various climate scenarios. The significant stress caused by unsustainable water resource allocation has been a perplexing problem for Sancha Lake, an important area in the southeast basin of the Dujiangyan Irrigation System in China. To identify the tradeoffs among stakeholders, we apply the proposed model to this basin. To gain further insight into climate change and water usage sustainability, we simulate the varying spatial and seasonal distribution of stream inflow based on historical climate data and propose different water management strategies for normal, slight drought, moderate drought, and serious drought conditions. This creates an emergency response cooperative mechanism based on different climate scenarios for developing countries that need to cope with water deficiency and uncertain situations.

AB Conventional methods for designing infrastructure that is subject to flood risk, such as dams and levees, assume a stationary design flood. However, observed and potential non-stationarity in floods can result in costly over design or dangerous under-design. Despite substantial attention, evidence from the literature makes clear there is no consensus methodology for estimating design variables under climate change. Practical guidance remains elusive. This paper presents a review of the challenges and advances in design of infrastructure for floods under non-stationarity. First, potential sources of non-stationarity in time series of floods are described to provide context and motivation. Second, methods for estimating design floods that rely on the stationary assumption are presented and their limitations are discussed. Third, methods for estimating design floods that assume non-stationarity resulting from climate change are summarized. Finally, the inadequacies of current design methodologies in view of the pervasive uncertainties are assessed and strategies to manage the consequences of those uncertainties are presented.

AB Mathematical models with small numbers of parameters are useful for hydrological analyses and water resources planning as they are easier to prepare, use, and interpret compared to more complex models. Many simple model structures and simulation strategies have been developed, but there is still substantial room for improvement in the efficiency of daily rainfall-runoff modeling. This study proposes daily rainfall-runoff models that require only two to four parameters yet are capable of predicting peak discharge and baseflow. Parsimonious model structures were obtained using the hyperbolic tangent function and combining it with one subsurface layer and two parameters of a Tank model. The daily rainfall-runoff models proposed based on the Two-Parameter Hyperbolic Model (TPHM) and Tank model were applied to 41 watersheds throughout South Korea. Model accuracy was evaluated by comparing observed and simulated watershed streamflow and compared with that of a nine parameter Tank model. The original TPHM and its variants yielded slightly better efficiency with a smaller number of parameters than the Tank model when reproducing high flows on a daily basis. The accuracy of low flow and flow duration curve predictions provided by the TPHM-based models was higher in watersheds with relatively large baseflow temporal variability. The results suggested that the TPHM-based structures be alternative parsimonious daily rainfall-runoff simulation models. This study demonstrates that daily high streamflow can be efficiently simulated using a two-parameter hydrological model, and daily baseflow simulation can be improved by adding two additional parameters to the model.

AB Developing an understanding of how groundwater (GW) and surface water (SW) systems function and interact to impact water quantity, water quality, and ecosystem health provides a basis for management of water resources, environmental protection, and land management. Although knowledge of these complex and dynamic systems has improved in recent decades, there is currently no systematic guidance for conceptualizing and evaluating GW-SW interactions and identifying their potential impact on management issues. For this reason, a holistic framework was created to provide a comprehensive and logical approach for identifying, understanding, and evaluating the key factors and processes controlling GW-SW interactions and understanding their relationship to environmental problems. The framework identifies fundamental hydrological, biogeochemical, and biological processes and critical factors to consider when developing robust conceptual models of GW-SW systems. The framework is comprehensive and can be adapted to different problems using only the aspects necessary to address a specific issue. The framework focuses on streams, rivers, and lakes but can be adapted for use in other GW-SW settings such as ponds, wetlands, and coastal marine environments. Applicability of the framework is illustrated through evaluation of three GW-SW interaction settings in southern Ontario, Canada: a groundwater contaminant plume discharging to the Pine River, discharge of groundwater nutrients to Lake Huron, and a regional-scale conceptualization of GW-SW flow interactions in the Duffins Creek watershed. The case studies highlight flexibility of the framework to develop conceptual models, assess environmental issues, identify knowledge gaps, and provide a basis for designing site investigations.

AB The finding of important explanatory variables for the location and scale parameters of the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, when the latter is used for the modelling of annual streamflow maxima, is known to have reduced the uncertainties in inferences, as estimated through regional flood frequency analysis frameworks. However, important explanatory variables have not been found for the GEV shape parameter, despite its critical significance, which stems from the fact that it determines the behaviour of the upper tail of the distribution. Here we examine the nature of the shape parameter by revealing its relationships with basin attributes. We use a dataset that comprises information about daily streamflow and forcing, climatic indices, topographic, land cover, soil and geological characteristics of 591 basins with minimal human influence in the contiguous United States. We propose a framework that uses random forests and linear models to find (a) important predictor variables of the shape parameter and (b) an interpretable model with high predictive performance. The process of study comprises of assessing the predictive performance of the models, selecting a parsimonious predicting model and interpreting the results in an ad-hoc manner. The findings suggest that the median of the shape parameter is 0.19, the shape parameter mostly depends on climatic indices, while the selected prediction model is a linear one and results in more than 20% higher accuracy in terms of RMSE compared to a naive approach. The implications are important, since it is shown that incorporating the regression model into regional flood frequency analysis frameworks can considerably reduce the predictive uncertainties.

AB Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR), as an advanced active sensor, can penetrate vegetation to detect ground information. The multimode observation data can provide more information to interpret different scattering mechanisms and have great application potential in soil moisture estimation (SME). In this paper, a modified method of soil moisture inversion from PoISAR data based on a two-component polarimetric decomposition model is introduced. The proposed method neglects the dihedral scattering component in the case of sparse vegetation cover and no-building areas, compensates the orientation angle by considering the influence of surface roughness and terrain slope, and calculates the dielectric constant with the hybrid X-Bragg/Fresnel model. Gaofen-3 (C-band) data from Ordos, Inner Mongolia, and Soil Moisture Experiment 2003 (SMEX03) airborne synthetic aperture radar (AIRSAR) (C- and L-band) data from Southern Oklahoma were applied in the experimental research. Furthermore, the performance and validity limits were assessed by comparing the retrieval results with in situ measurements and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture products. The results reveal a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 8.66% with an inversion rate of up to 61% when using the Gaofen-3 data from Ordos. For the Southern Oklahoma study area, the inversion RMSE of the AIRSAR C- and L-band data is 8.57% and 8.95%, respectively. The tendency of the inversion results is also consistent with the change trend of the site observations. In the bare soil and sparse vegetation covered areas, the retrieval error is relatively small, while in dense vegetation covered areas, soil moisture is underestimated in both the C- and L-band data, and the former is more underestimated than the latter.

AB Flood is a major natural hazard with extremely large impact on social-ecological systems. Therefore, developing reliable and efficient tools to identify areas vulnerable to potential flooding is vital for water managers, engineers and decision makers. Moreover, being able to accurately classify the level of hazard is a step forward towards more efficient flood hazard mapping. This study presents a multi-criteria index approach to classify potential flood hazards at the river basin scale. The presented methodology was implemented in the Mashhad Plain basin in North-east Iran, where flood has been a major issue in the last few decades. In the present study, seven factors, selected based on their greater influence towards flooding, were identified and extracted from the basic thematic layers to be used to generate a five-class Flood Hazard Index (FHI) map. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to develop a runoff coefficient map, which was found to be the most influential factor. A sensitivity analysis was performed and the results incorporated to generate a modified Flood Hazard Index (mFHI) map. The accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated against the well-documented flood records in the last 42 years at the study area. The results showed that, for both FHI and mFHI maps, more than 97% of historical flood events have occurred in moderate to very high flood hazard areas. This demonstrates that incorporating hydrological model (such as SWAT) and multi-criteria analysis introduces a robust methodology to generate comprehensive potential flood hazard maps. Moreover, the proposed modified methodology can be used to identify high potential flood hazard zones and work towards more efficient flood management and mitigation strategies.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article
DE Surface precipitation estimation; Radar-gauge combination; Rainfall
   displacement
ID WIND-DRIFT; EXTERNAL DRIFT; FIELDS
AB Rain gauges are the foundation in hydrology to collect rainfall data, however gauge observations alone are limited at representing the complete rainfall distribution. On the other hand, weather radar can provide a nearly complete spatial distribution of rainfall qualitatively at high temporal and spatial resolution, yet concerns about the biases in the precipitation estimates hamper the direct use of radar data in hydrological applications. Thus the focus of this study is to derive a scheme to merge radar precipitation estimates and the contemporaneous point-wise rain gauge observations. It is common practice to construct radar-gauge pairs by assuming the vertical and instant falling of the hydrometeors from aloft onto the ground. On many occasions, the assumption is invalid, as it ignores a significant fact that the hydrometeors are very likely to be laterally advected in the air by the wind while descending, especially from a large height and/or with the existence of snow. The laterally displacement of rainfall will result in a great discrepancy of radar and gauge data. Concerning these issues, a method to quantify the displacement of rainfall is proposed and the results of the quantification are integrated into much improved surface precipitation estimates.

AB Fluid flow architecture in fractured reservoirs is mainly based on the dual porosity model. In this model, the matrix block is considered as a fluid storage source and fracture as a flow path. Nevertheless, in naturally fractured reservoirs, different properties of matrix blocks and fracture systems have caused the triple porosity model to be more applicable than the traditional dual porosity model.
   The existed triple porosity models presented so far are mainly based on pseudo steady state flow in the matrix block and vug and via a semi-analytic form. In this paper, two analytical models of triple porosity model are presented with consideration of transient flow; the first model being: the series flow of the matrix block to the vug and the vug to the fracture, and the second model: transient parallel flow of the matrix block and vug to the fracture. In this paper, for the first time, an analytical and transient shape factor between different regions is put forward.
   Using the developed new solution, various flow regimes in triple porosity model have been identified. In the series triple porosity model, changing the parameters of vug and matrix did not affect the early production while it influenced the rate of the middle and lately times. The shape factor between the matrix and vug was independent of the physical properties of vug while the shape factor between vug and fracture was influenced by the physical properties of vug and matrix. In the parallel triple porosity model, the shape factor of matrix-fracture and vug-fracture were not dependent on the properties of the other regions of rock. Moreover, a decrease in inter-porosity coefficient and an increase in storativity ratio increased the shape factor in transient time.
   Additionally, in order to validate the analytical model, the results of the model are compared with the numerical simulations. This study presents a new analytical and transient shape factor which finds application in simulation of triple porosity formations.

AB Information on extreme precipitation is essential to managing weather-related risks and designing hydraulic structures. Research attention to frequency analyses based on remotely sensed precipitation datasets, such as those obtained from weather radars and satellites, has been rapidly increasing owing to their potential to provide information for ungauged regions worldwide. Together with the ability to measure the areal scale directly, these analyses promise to overcome the sampling limitations of traditional methods based on rain gauges. This focused review of the literature depicts the state of the art after a decade of efforts, and identifies the crucial gaps in knowledge and methodology that currently hinder the quantitative use of remotely sensed datasets in water resources system design and operation. It concludes by highlighting a set of research directions promising immediate impact with regard to the separation of the sources of uncertainty currently affecting applications based on remotely sensed datasets, the development of statistical methods that can cope with the peculiar characteristics of these datasets, and the improvement of validation methods. Important gains in knowledge are expected from the explicit inclusion of the areal dimension in the analyses and from the fine-scale investigation of extreme precipitation climatology.

AB Knowledge of vegetative responses to drought across hydroclimatic zones is crucial for understanding ecohydrologic cycles. Based on monthly self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) at different time scales (1-48 month scales), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), this study examined the relationship between natural vegetation dynamics and drought in the growing season during 1982-2012 at 293 sites over China. Pearson correlations between NDVI and drought indices (PDSI and SPED were employed to quantify the association between vegetation and drought. The results show that the Pearson correlations between PDSI and NDVI in growing season (C-NP) ranged from -0.47 to 0.84, and the maximum correlation between SPEI and NDVI in growing season (MaxSPEI) ranged from -0.31 to 0.86, within which the negative correlations were mainly observed in the areas dominated by forest in south China. Moreover, the C-NP was highly and nonlinearly related to the aridity index (empty set) (MaxSPEI showed a similar trend). The relationship between C-NP and empty set indicated that, water stress was not the limiting factor for natural vegetation in humid regions (empty set < 0.98) even during droughts; the drought vulnerability of natural vegetation increased with increasing empty set up to a point (empty set = 4.68) and then decreased with increasing empty set when empty set > 4.68; in extreme arid regions, the natural vegetation exhibited less sensitivity to drought. These tendencies could be seen worldwide. The varied physiological properties of plants and the response of photosynthesis to energy processes probably explain some discernible variation.

AB A fully-saturated lens of steady fresh groundwater floating in a homogeneous and isotropic desert sandy aquifer is analytically studied based on a hydrological model by Kunin and interface solution by Van Der Veer. A static saline groundwater is beneath the lens. A phreatic surface of moving fresh water inside the lens is partially recharged (either naturally or by managed aquifer recharge) from the vadose zone and partially exfiltrates to it. A spatially focused recharge and intensive evapotranspiration preserve a steady downward-upward topology of fresh water motion. In terms of the 1-D Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation in a horizontal in-lens saturated flow a boundary value problem (BVP) for an ODE for the Strack potential is solved. The shape of the water table and, based on the Ghijben-Herzberg assumption, the interface are found. The total volume of the positive-pore pressure water flowing within the lens is evaluated. Constant infiltration and evaporation rates as well as evaporation linearly decreasing with depth of the water table (counted from the ground surface) are considered. The case of 2-D flow is tackled by the Toth model. A triangular analytic element approximates a half of the flow domain and consists of an isobaric side and two no-flow sides. Conformal mapping of this triangle onto a reference plane and solution of the Dirichlet BVP in a half-plane deliver the distribution of infiltration-exfiltration intensity along the water table, total flow rate and locus of the hinge point. A mathematically more cumbersome approximation of the flow domain assumes the water table to be a tilted straight line but the interface to be found as a free boundary. Solution of the corresponding BVP uses a curvilinear triangle in the hodograph plane.

TI Groundwater DRASTIC vulnerability mapping by unsupervised and supervised
   techniques using a modelling strategy in two levels

AB Production of defensible modelling tools for aquifer vulnerability mapping under the conditions of sparse data remains topical using the DRASTIC framework. DRASTIC is the acronym for seven data layers using a prescribed scoring system in terms of rates to account for local variations and weights to account for the relative importance of data layers. Also, the term framework signifies the consensual nature of choosing the data layers without any theoretical or empirical basis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) or similar techniques are used to reduce inherent subjectivities through a strategy of unsupervised learning from data by formulating Multiple Frameworks (MF) and supervised learning from Multiple Models (MMs) without searching for any 'superior' model. Notably, a framework lacks the procedure for iterative training and testing, as usual in modelling procedures. In this strategy, models are organised in two hierarchical levels: Level I comprises the construction of MFs (two frameworks) and/or MMs (two models); Level 2 comprises a model or an algorithm to reuse the outputs from Level 1 through formulating four strategies, including a mixture of MFs/MMs, in which Support Vector Machine (SVM) is chosen by the paper to run models at Level 2. The supervision process uses target values as a function of observed nitrate-N values. The strategy is applied to the aquifer in the Malekan region, where the past extensive agricultural practices have been transformed into intensive use of fertilisers without protecting water quality in the aquifers. Results show that AIMM/MF lead to significant improvements in delineating high vulnerability areas.

AB Glacier-wide mass balances and runoffs are reconstructed over 1969-2016 for Chhota Shigri Glacier catchment (India) applying a glacio-hydrological model. The model is forced using in-situ daily air-temperature and precipitation records from the meteorological stations at Bhuntar Observatory (1092 m a.s.l.), glacier base camp (3850 m a.s.l.) and glacier side moraine (4863 m a.s.l.). The modelled mean annual mass balance is -0.30 +/- 0.36m w.e.a(-1) (meter water equivalent per year), while the mean catchment-wide runoff is 1.56 +/- 0.23 m w.e.a(-1) over 1969-2016. Three periods are distinguished in the reconstructed mass balance and runoff series. Periods I (1969-1985) and III (2001-2016) show glacier mass wastage at rates of -0.36 and - 0.50 m w.e.a(-1), respectively, corresponding to catchment-wide runoffs of 1.51 and 1.65 m w.e.a(-1), respectively. Conversely, period II (1986-2000) exhibits steady-state conditions with average mass balances of -0.01 m w.e.a(-1), and corresponding runoff of 1.52m w.e.a(-1). The reduced ice melt (0.20m w.e.a(-1)) over period II, in agreement with steady-state conditions, is compensated by the increased snow melt (1.03 m w.e.a(-1)), providing almost similar catchment-wide runoffs for period I and II. The increased runoff after 2000 is mainly governed by increased ice melt (0.32m w.e.a(-1)) over period III. Snow accumulation in winter and summer seasons together control the glacier-wide mass balances as well as catchment-wide runoffs. Snow melt contributes the maximum to the total mean annual runoff with 63% share while glacier melt and rain contribute 17% and 20% respectively over the whole period.

   Heterogeneous reservoir
ID ANALYZING LINEAR FLOW; HORIZONTAL WELLS; PRESSURE; FLUID; CONDUCTIVITY;
   PERMEABILITY
AB The significance of unconventional low-permeability reservoir development has been well recognized in recent years. Pressure- and rate-transient behavior analyses are crucial methods of finding key factors that affect well production in these formations. However, previous analytically or semi-analytically based gridless models of pressure- and rate-transient response analyses for multi-stage fractured horizontal wells (MFHWs) mainly deal with homogeneous reservoirs and merely use skin factors to describe the fracture damage. Fracture damage normally refers to the conductivity reduction within hydraulic fractures and the matrix permeability or porosity impairment near the fracture face. The widely applied skin factors are derived under steady-state conditions and are accurate only when the damage length is small. They also show inability to simulate partially propped fractures and multiple fracture damage scenarios.
   In this article, a general linear flow model is established to simulate heterogeneous box-shaped unconventional low-permeability reservoirs with closed outer boundaries and various hydraulic fracture damage, including (1) fracture near-wellbore damage caused by proppant flow-back, over-displacement, embedment, crush or ineffective placement, (2) partially propped fractures with undamaged near-wellbore regions, (3) fracturing fluid leak-off damage in the adjacent matrix, (4) dual or multiple damage effects under unsteady-flow conditions. The fracture interference in heterogeneous reservoirs is modeled by our previous method (Zeng et al., 2018).
   The basic model has been verified against well-testing software KAPPA, and satisfactory agreements are obtained. New type curves have been generated with distinct flow regimes for specific fracture damage mechanisms. Sensitivity analyses have been conducted to find out how the damage properties affect the shape and duration of these distinct regimes. Reservoir heterogeneity combined with fracture damage makes the pressure and rate behavior deviate significantly from the undamaged homogeneous one and controls the fracture flux distribution in certain regimes during production for both constant-rate and constant-pressure production cases. In addition, field data from the Cardium unconventional light oil formation in western Canada are analyzed through type curve matching, which demonstrates the benefits of our model. The findings of this model are potentially helpful for field data analyses and fracture damage diagnostic.

AB Several studies have documented the characteristics of seasonal, decadal, and spatial variations of tritium in different regions including North America, Australia, and Europe. However, long-term data such as these studies were not yet reported for Northeast Asia. In this study, we document the extensive spatial-temporal monitoring data of tritium levels in precipitation measured at 16 stations in Korea over the last 20 years, including the long-term trend since 1961 by using measured and estimated data. The long-term variation of tritium concentrations in the Korean precipitation follows the global trend, reaching the maximum in 1963 owing to nuclear bomb testing, followed by a consistent level since the late 1990s. Tritium concentrations in precipitation from 1998 to 2017 were maximum in spring (April) due to tropopause folding and minimum in summer (July) due to the dominant inflows of marine air. The tritium concentrations in precipitation were lower toward the coastal stations, due to the influence of marine moisture for all seasons. Our results characterize the differences in tritium levels in groundwater recharging areas for different periods in this region. These results will serve as important tritium reference data for hydrology studies in Northeast Asia, which is an important region for understanding global hydrological cycles.

AB Statistical post-processing methods have been applied in hydrometeorological forecasting to correct the bias and spread error in raw forecasts. Among various post-processing methods, the meta-Gaussian distribution model (MGD) is one of the early successful methods for post-processing of precipitation forecasts and has been applied in the National Weather Service's Hydrologic Ensemble Forecast System (HEFS), together with the mix-type meta-Gaussian distribution model (MMGD). However, recent studies have shown that the original MGD cannot yield reliable forecasts especially for sub-daily precipitation forecasts (e.g., 6-hourly). In this paper, we improved the MGD model by applying the censored maximum likelihood estimation (CMLE) method. We conducted experiments using GEFS reforecasts in Huai river basin in China to evaluate its performance. The results show that the proposed method performs better than the original MGD for sub-daily precipitation forecasts. The proposed method also achieves similar forecast skill with the state-of-the-art censored, shifted Gamma distribution-based ensemble MOS (CSGD-EMOS) if both use ensemble mean as the only predictor. The results indicate that the proposed CMLE-MGD can be useful for further applications such as flood forecasting that needs forecasts of high temporal resolution.

AB Human activities have altered terrestrial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics via changes to land cover and use such as deforestation, agriculture, application of fertilizers, etc. and have influenced the patterns of organic C input and eutrophication in downstream freshwater ecosystems. Biogeochemical cycling of C and N and the related organic carbon (OC) production may display correlated diurnal and seasonal variations due to photosynthesis and respiration in these ecosystems, whose underlying mechanisms still need to be resolved. In this study, we document the diurnal and seasonal variations measured in DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon), NO3-, TOC (total organic carbon) and other related hydrochemical parameters (pH and DO-dissolved oxygen) in five artificial spring-pond ecosystems with differing land-uses in tanks draining into springs and corresponding ponds, constructed at the Shawan Karst Test Site, SW China. It was found that diurnal changes in DIC, NO3- and TOC in all ponds were dominated by aquatic ecosystem metabolism (i.e., photosynthesis and respiration), as evidenced by the pertinent variations in DO and pH. Daily DIC and NO3- uptake and OC production were higher in October (growing period) and lower in January (dormant period), indicating seasonal differences in assimilation that were determined by both changes in weather (temperature and light) and nutrient inputs. Under conditions of bare rock or bare soil, there was very low DIC and NO3- additions to the spring-pond ecosystems, resulting in lower OC productivity in the ponds. Cropped land yielded higher DIC and NO3- to the pond, due to growth of corn and use of fertilizers that enhanced OC production. Highest productivity and densest vegetation cover on tanks with grassland or shrubs (with higher N retention in soils) resulted in higher DIC but limited NO3- addition to the ecosystems downstream. The highest DIC concentration (in the grassland) resulted in maximum OC production in the pond. These results indicate that OC production in the ponds with elevated pH was limited by DIC fertilization. In general, the supply of DIC is not considered to limit aquatic primary productivity because its concentration exceeds that of other plant macronutrients such as NO3 and PO43- by two or three orders of magnitude. Therefore, the carbon limitation detected here may indicate that photoautotrophs in karst dominated aquatic terrains (dominated by Charophyta and Spirogyra) cannot use the total DIC for photosynthesis but only the dissolved CO2, which comprises < 1% of total DIC at pH > 8.2 that is characteristic in these environments. This may have implications for control of eutrophication in such alkaline aquatic ecosystems, i.e., rates of eutrophication in freshwater ecosystems may be regulated not only by N and/or P but also by C. It is also projected that there will be an increase in OC sequestration with the current land-use and global climate change-driven increases in DIC, due to carbon limitation of aquatic primary production.

AB Coal remains the largest contributor to China's energy structure. However, coal production has frequently been threatened by groundwater inrush incidents induced by fault zones. The variations in the hydraulic properties of fault zones under high water pressure in relation to groundwater inrush risk are poorly understood. This paper presents high-pressure fluid injection tests used to investigate the variations in hydraulic properties of a fault zone at depth. The analysis of experimental results shows that the injection rate and hydraulic conductivity increase as nonlinear functions of injection pressure. The evolution process induced by high water pressure can be divided into three flow phases, including a Darcy flow phase, a flow transition phase and an unstable flow phase. Two thresholds of injection pressure for the onset of nonlinear flow and the onset of substantial fracture dilation and hydraulic fracturing were identified. The hydraulic conductivity of the fault zone is closely related to the water pressure, with an evident increase in permeability resulting from fracture extension and enhancement of fracture connectivity, which were attributed to water injection. Finally, a conceptual model was developed to demonstrate the textural and hydraulic evolution of the fault zone.

AB Changes in terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) are not only influenced by local climate conditions but also by teleconnection factors. To date, how teleconnection factors including sunspot activities could affect TWSA has been under-examined. In this study, we investigate the TWSA dynamics in the Yunnan Province (YP), China, and assess their relationships with teleconnection factors at multiple timescales. Results show that: (1) GRACE data is able to reflect TWSA dynamics in the study region, as demonstrated by its high correlations with soil moisture, precipitation, and groundwater anomalies; (2) GRACE-based TWSA shows a downward trend of varying degrees at the monthly, seasonal, annual and multi-year scales, with obvious periodic changes of 11 and around 60 months; (3) precipitation magnitude and its distribution characteristics in humid areas are the main driving factors of TWSA, and teleconnection factors have stronger association with precipitation-concentration degree (PCD) than precipitation magnitude; (4) the 2009 extreme drought has caused a sharp decrease in TWSA, and the correlations between TWSA with Arctic Oscillation (AO) and El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) were 0.88 (a = 0.01) and -0.58 (a = 0.01). This study sheds new insights into how teleconnection factors could TWSA dynamics in a changing environment.

DE Hydrometric measurement; Network design; Optimisation; Cross-sectional

ID CATCHMENTS; TIME
AB Decreased funding and shifting governmental priorities have resulted in a contraction of hydrometric measurement in many regions over the past two decades. Moreover, concerns exist with respect to appropriate data usage and (transboundary) exchange, in addition to the compatibility and extent of existing hydrometric datasets. These issues are undoubtedly magnified due to enhanced data demands and increased financial pressures on network managers, thus requiring new approaches to optimising the societal benefits and overall efficacy of hydrometric information for future socio-hydrological resilience.
   The current study employed a quantitative cross-sectional expert elicitation of 203 respondents to collate, analyse and assess hydrometric network users' opinions, knowledge and experience. Current usage patterns, perceived network strengths, requirements, and limitations have been identified and discussed within the context of hydrometric resilience in a changing social, economic and natural environment. Findings indicate that small (<30 km(2)) catchment data are most frequently employed in the Republic of Ireland, particularly with respect to extreme event prediction and flood management. Similarly, small catchments and areas characterised by previous/recent flooding were prioritised for resilience management via network amendment. Over half of those surveyed (50.5%) reported the current network as inadequate for their professional requirements. Conversely, respondents indicated network efficacy has improved (53.2%) or remained stable (26.6%) over the course of their professional career, however, improvements (as defined by individual respondents i.e. network density, data quality, data availability) have not occurred at a sufficient rate. User-defined efficacy (adequacy, resilience) was found to be a somewhat vague, multivariate concept, with no individual predictor identified, however, general data quality, network density, and urban catchment data were the most significant issues among respondents. A significant majority (85.4%) of respondents indicate that future resilience would be best achieved via network density amendment, with over 60% favouring geographically and/or categorically focused network increases, as opposed to more general national increases.

AB Litter and vegetation under forest canopy (i.e., understory vegetation) are known to reduce soil erosion and contribute substantially to evapotranspiration. However, previous studies rarely examined understory water interception. We conducted a comprehensive study of rainfall partitioning using a water balance equation that included both overstory and understory components in a Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantation and a nearby naturally regenerated Castanopsis (C. carlesii) forest of similar age in southeastern China. Understory interception was measured by submerging understory components (vegetation and litter) in water for 24 h, which gave an estimate of the amount of water retained (i.e., water holding capacity). The total interception loss of rainfall events (> 9.8 mm) that generated surface runoff converged between the two forests, a result of a smaller overstory interception loss (20%) coupled with a greater understory interception loss (14%) in the Chinese fir plantation relative to the Castanopsis forest (overstory 25% and understory 11%). The convergence of the total interception contributed to the convergence of the surface runoff, 1% of the rainfall in both forests. Furthermore, the throughfall partition (78%) was greater whereas the stemflow partition (2%) was smaller in the Chinese fir plantation relative to the Castanopsis forest (throughfall 70% and stemflow 5%). These patterns in rainfall partitioning could be explained by the greater development of the understory vegetation (hence greater understory interception loss) in the Chinese fir plantation, lower canopy leaf area index (hence smaller overstory interception loss and greater throughfall), and rougher barks (hence smaller stemflow) of Chinese fir trees compared to that of Castanopsis trees. Our study illustrated that a comprehensive evaluation of interception loss must take into account understory components.

AB Climate change and human activities are two important factors affecting surface runoff. In water resource planning and management, it is usually important to separate the contribution of the mentioned factors to the runoff change. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed to obtain the relative impact of human activities and climate change on streamflow under uncertainty. In this methodology, the breakpoint of the annual time series of the observed runoff is estimated and the time series is divided into two study periods; before and after the breakpoint, namely the "natural" and "impacted" periods. The Jazim monthly water balance model is used for monthly runoff simulation. To incorporate the effect of snow in simulating runoff, two Jazim-based monthly water balance models with Rao and Al Wagdany (1995) and McCabe and Markstrom (2007) snow modules are used. Then, the monthly water balance models are calibrated and verified for the natural and impacted periods. The main parameters of the water balance models are optimized using the Genetic Algorithms. The uncertainty of the parameters of the models is analyzed using differential evolution adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm, which is based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. This algorithm provides the posterior probability distribution functions (PDFs) of parameters of the runoff simulation models. Next, the PDFs of the contribution rate (CR) of the climate change and human activities to runoff are determined using the fixing changing method by taking into account the PDFs of the models' parameters. To show the applicability and efficiency of the proposed methodology, it is applied to the Zayandehrud sub-basin in Iran. Using the Standard Normal Homogeneity Test (SNHT), Pettitt and Buishand range tests, one breakpoint at 2006 is detected in runoff time series. Through the monthly rainfall-runoff simulations and the fixing-changing method, it is estimated that decrease in the runoff after the breakpoint can be attributed to climate change by 57.8% and 45%, using the Jazim-Rao & Al Wagdany model and the Jazim-McCabe & Markstrom model, respectively. The results of the uncertainty analysis of the parameters of the water balance models show that the parameters of LSMX (maximum moisture capacity of the lower soil layer) and K-3 (deep percolation coefficient) are the most significant parameters in the uncertainty of runoff simulated by both the models. According to the PDFs of contribution rate (CR) of climate change and human activities which are obtained using each rainfall-runoff model, it can be inferred that the Jazim-McCabe & Markstrom model significantly decreased the uncertainty of estimations.

AB Little measurement-based soil moisture information is available for the humid to semi-humid transitional zones in China. Anhui Province is a representative area of these zones and spans several hydroclimatic and geomorphological zones. To overcome shortage of observational soil moisture information in this area, we collected and compiled a multi-layer daily soil moisture record from 2012 to 2016 across Anhui Province based on the observations of a soil moisture-observing network composed of 85 sites. We then analyzed the vertical and spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture across this region. Primary findings are: (a) soil moisture in this region has apparent vertical gradients and increases with soil depth; (b) substantial soil moisture spatial variability appears in the shallow soil layers (depth <= 40 cm) with the highest values in the middle part of this region, but soil moisture in the deep layers (depth > 40 cm) shows low spatial variability; (c) seasonality of soil moisture across this region is complicated and has fluctuations with July as the wettest month in most of the province; (d) inter-monthly fluctuation of soil moisture is larger in the upper soil layers than in the lower layers; and (e) antecedent accumulated rainfall is a major factor influencing soil moisture throughout this region with soil moisture in the upper layers more sensitive to immediate weather conditions and soil moisture in the lower layers showing lagged responses to the weather conditions. This study can not only reveal the spatiotemporal and vertical characteristics of soil moisture across this region, but also provide a useful reference dataset for the other soil moisture modeling and retrieval studies.

AB Effective management of nonpoint source (NPS) pollutants requires an understanding of their potential surface runoff and baseflow pathways. In this study, an integrated method was developed for separating baseflow and surface NPS pollutants at the watershed scale. Then, the uncertainty of the prediction of baseflow NPS pollutants was explored by comparing four hydrographic separation methods (the United Kingdom Institute of Hydrology (UKIH), the Lyne-Hollick (LH) method, the Eckhardt (ECK) method and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)), three data sources (monitoring data, SWAT and the LOADEST model) and two baseflow period assumptions. A real case study was performed in a typical catchment, the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China. The results showed that the baseflow annually contributed 30.1% and 23.0% of the total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) load, respectively, indicating that baseflow was identified as the key means of transport of NPS pollutants, especially for NPS-N during the dry season. The water quality data source represents the largest uncertainty source in baseflow NPS pollutant estimation, and the simulated baseflow loads of TN and TP were the largest when LOADEST and SWAT were used as water quality data sources, respectively. The baseflow NPS estimations were more uncertain for TN during the non-dry season and TP during the dry season. The results of this study could provide implications for the prediction and management of NPS pollutants at the watershed scale, especially for groundwater-polluted catchments.

AB Climate change and human activities have induced alterations to hydrological processes. The quantification of their impacts on streamflow is a challenge, especially at the seasonal scale due to seasonality of climate variables and human activities. In this study, the decomposition method based on Budyko equation is extended to the seasonal scale for quantifying the climate and direct human impacts on annual and seasonal streamflow changes in Huifa River basin by defining prechange period (1953-1974) and postchange period (1975-2005). The results are further verified by the monthly abcd model. Both climate change and direct human activities are found to induce a decrease in streamflow at the annual scale, with 68% of the change contributed by direct human activities. At the seasonal scale, the direct human-induced declines in streamflow account for 67% and 39% of the total changes for energy-limited and water-limited seasons, respectively; whereas, the impact of direct human activities is more pronounced during the irrigation season due to water withdrawal for irrigation. In addition, the decomposition results are analyzed for each month in the energy-limited season to reveal the effects of precipitation and operation rules of ponds and reservoirs during the flood season.

AB Precipitation data plays an important role in investigation of water-related fields of research such as water resources management, hydraulic structure design and groundwater quantity/quality parameters due to its high variability in space and time. To evaluate and investigate precipitation pattern, a set of well-designed rain gauge stations can substantially reduce the cost and increase the estimation accuracy. In the present research, a new methodology of spatiotemporal optimization is developed for a rain gauge monitoring network and the results are compared to the optimized network based on spatial variations of precipitation. The optimization process consists of two main steps of application of multi attribute decision making and heuristic approaches. The entropy is chosen as the multi attribute decision making approach to determine optimum number of stations. Then, the optimization process is implemented via coupling of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and geostatistical methods to identify the best rain gauge network configuration. To determine the spatiotemporal structure of precipitation, spatiotemporal variography and geostatistical methods known as Ordinary Kriging (OK) and Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) have been undertaken. Thirty years of annual precipitation data from 105 rain gauge stations within and near Namak Lake watershed in the central part of Iran are utilized in this research to optimize rain gauge stations spatially and temporally. Results showed that spatiotemporal network design considerably differs from spatial optimal rain gauge stations. Optimal locations of rain gauge stations resulted from spatiotemporal approach are almost two times better than spatial configuration to reduce rain gauge costs (installation, operation, maintenance, etc.) by avoiding data redundancy more efficiently. In addition, BMEbased network design method outperformed OK-based network.

AB Vernal pools are seasonal wetlands that have a high diversity of endemic and native plant species, yet they are threatened by agricultural conversion and urban development and face threats posed by climate change resulting from altered precipitation and temperature regimes. We developed an approach to investigate the potential impacts of climate change on hydrology and vegetation communities of vernal pools by creating a mass-balance hydrologic model that is coupled to a statistical model of plant community distribution. The hydrologic and vegetative models were calibrated using field measurements from a vernal pool in northeastern California that experiences snow-dominated hydrology and is larger than vernal pools in more studied areas like Central California, but representative of other northern California vernal pools. Using downscaled data from global climate models, the coupled model suggests that warmer conditions will lead to the pool being inundated for a shorter time, but with little change in maximum depth. Reduced hydroperiods suggest possible declines in vernal pool specialist species with future climate change. The coupled model is an integrated approach for understanding the impact of altered environmental conditions on unique hydrology and plant community composition of vernal pool ecosystems, but the model approach could be improved with longer term data and by applying it at more sites to broaden the applicability of the approach and to enable better process representation.

DE Spring backup; Ice jam; Water level distribution; b-Value
ID LENA RIVER; FLOODS
AB Distributions of daily average water levels prior to ice-jams and in jam-free periods during spring breakups in the Lena river were constructed. The results showed that during periods of water rising in jam-free years, water levels were distributed in a random manner, in accordance with an exponential (Poisson-like) function. In contrast, water-level distributions during periods preceding ice-jams followed a power law similar to various multiscale hydrological phenomena, such as flood occurrences, return periods of rainfall, Arctic drifting-ice dynamics, and other nonequilibrium natural processes. However, the complexity of ice-jam floods is of a particular kind. In many cases, the power exponent in a water-level distribution (referred to as the b-value in a Gutenberg-Richter relation) increased sharply a few days before an ice-jam. In other words, a plot of the entire power-law distribution usually consists of two portions, differing in their slope. In terms of thermodynamics, an increase of the b-value leads to a decrease of the system conservation. To explain this effect, one should take into account that ice-jams are frequently preceded by advances of ice, which changes the energy balance in the water-ice system. As a result, the power exponent in water-level distributions appears to be higher in the partially fragmented ice cover.

ID MEASURING CAMPAIGNS; IDENTIFIABILITY
AB Water quality data in the sewer system are indispensable for modelling, but rarely available, as measurements in sewers are challenging to conduct. Optimal experimental design (OED) is a powerful tool to identify and maximize the information content of measurement data. This paper adopts a model-based OED methodology to efficiently plan a measurement campaign for final model calibration and validation of a new sewer water quality model. To do so, a preliminary calibrated model of the case study is used to evaluate the information content of different potential measurement locations and scenarios for suspended solids as measured variable. The case study first demonstrates how OED can identify the best measurement location within a complex sewer network. It secondly demonstrates that measuring the beginning of a big rain event results in the most information-rich data among all scenarios evaluated. Thirdly, it analyses in detail the information content of dry weather flow (DWF) data. In comparison to previous studies the methodology is improved by considering the actual measurement error characteristics when calculating the information content of measurement data.

AB Accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is critical for water resource management and irrigation scheduling. This study evaluated the potential of a new machine learning algorithm using gradient boosting on decision trees with categorical features support (i.e., CatBoost) for accurately estimating daily ET0 with limited meteorological data in humid regions of China. Two other commonly used machine learning algorithms, Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were also assessed for comparison. Eight input combinations of daily meteorological data [including both complete and incomplete combinations of solar radiation (R-s), maximum and minimum temperatures (T-max and T-min), relative humidity (H-r) and wind speed (U)] from five weather stations during 2001-2015 in South China were applied for model training and testing. The results showed that all the three algorithms could achieve satisfactory accuracy for ET0 estimation in subtropical China using R-s, T-max and T-min, or U, H-r, T-max, and T-min as inputs, under the circumstances of lacking complete meteorological parameters. The increases in testing RMSE and MAPE over training RMSE and MAPE showed positive correlations with the number of input parameters to the machine learning models. For the local models, among the three algorithms, SVM offered the best prediction accuracy and stability with incomplete combinations of meteorological parameters as inputs, while CatBoost performed best with the complete combination of parameters. Patterns of the generalized models were almost the same as the local models, but the former ones showed less than 10% decreases in RMSE or MAPE in comparison with the latter ones. In addition, the computing time and memory usage for data processing of CatBoost were much less than those of RF and SVM. Overall, as a tree-based algorithm, CatBoost made significant improvements in accuracy, stability and computational cost when compared to RF. Therefore, the CatBoost algorithm has a very high potential for ET0 estimation in humid regions of China, and even possibly in other parts of the world with similar humid climates.

AB To date, many numerical approaches are available in studying water flow and sediment dynamics along rivers from the reach to the watershed scale, based on various simplifications. The aim of the present research is to demonstrate how the so-called "morphodynamic quasi-equilibrium hypothesis" is effective in modelling riverine landscape morphodynamics evolution at the watershed scale, focussing on the long-term changes of longitudinal profile and bed grainsize composition of large alluvial rivers. A lumped 0-D, two-reach, two-grainsize model based on the Local Uniform Flow hypothesis and originally developed for reproducing fluvial changes at the historical time-scale, has been applied to three large watercourses to reproduce their long-term evolution, performing a sensitivity analysis based on the present conditions. Three morphometric parameters were analysed, aiming to describe the evolution of the longitudinal profile (concavity and aggrading) and the grain-size composition of the river bed (fining). Though the 0-D approach does not allow for a spatial distribution of the input parameters, namely the liquid and solid discharge, the modelling outcomes show reasonably good qualitative trends. At the scale of analysis (centuries to millennia) and for the chosen large sedimentary systems (thousands of kilometres long), which show high inertia to geomorphological changes likely owing to their longitudinal scale, the model can be helpful in detecting where the present conditions reflect a big disturbance to the "natural" trend. This initial detection method can provide additional insights in evaluating the capability of actual rivers to respond to the present external forcing, eventually reaching a quasi-stable configuration.

AB Grass swales are important elements of the urban green infrastructure that convey and attenuate urban runoff and improve its quality mostly through stormwater infiltration into, and retention of conveyed pollutants by, swale soils. The retention of metals by grass swales was addressed in this study investigating the enrichment of swale soils by three common traffic-related metals: Cu, Pb and Zn. Three swales of various characteristics (L1, L2, L3) were selected for study and their soils were sampled by coring the top 30 cm and dividing the cores into 5 cm thick layers. Cumulative metal burdens were compared to those modelled by the proprietary StormTac Web model, which estimates annual loads of specific constituents for the given land uses and stormwater treatment. The comparisons of measured (MBm) and simulated (MBs) metal burdens retained by swales showed that the measured values exceed the simulated ones, as described by average ratios MBs/MBm = 0.64, 0.50 and 0.59, for swales L1, L2 and L3, respectively. The measured burdens were calculated after subtracting the native soil metal concentrations, assumed equal to those found in the deepest sampled layer, 25-30 cm below the surface. The results suggest the feasibility of assessing performance of grass swales by modelling metal (Cu, Pb, Zn) retention by swales, however for older facilities considered for rehabilitation, the simulated results should be supplemented by soil chemistry sampling.

TI Factors controlling evolution of karst conduits in sandy limestone and

AB Karst potential is rarely studied in calcareous sandstones and sandy limestones. The minimum content of carbonate necessary for the development of conduits is unknown, and the mechanisms of the origins of conduits in these rocks are poorly understood. This article focuses upon these questions in an important regional aquifer.
   Samples of limestones and sandstones were taken from outcrops in vertical profiles, and were subjected to a rapid dissolution test with 10% HCI. The degree of disintegration of the samples after dissolution of the carbonate was observed in order to estimate which portions of the rock enabled formation of karst conduits. Carbonate content was measured by calcimetry. Distribution of calcite cement and other sources of cohesion were studied by scanning electron microscopy. Tracer tests in the conduits were evaluated.
   Calcite is the dominant carbonate mineral and main cementing agent in the Jizera Fm. Aquifer (mean content 51%). However, calcite content was found to be a weak predictor of karst potential. Most of the samples disintegrated completely if the calcite content exceeded 55%. On the other hand, some rocks with a calcite content up to 70% did not disintegrate due to microcrystalline/amorphous silica, which bound the quartz grains together and/or formed a foam-like supporting structure.
   After in situ calcite dissolution, the rock in karst-prone zones is turned to residuum, which consequently is washed out by fast flow (0.01-0.2 m/s, based on tracer tests). Microscopic study of cementing agents of the siliciclastic-carbonate sediments and dissolution tests are essential for understanding the mechanisms of conduit origin in ghost-rock karst.

AB Wetlands are considered to be the important carbon sequestration functional units, and moisture is a critical environmental factor that affects the mineralization of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, little information is available on the effects of soil moisture on SOC mineralization in floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies. Soil samples to a depth of 20 cm were collected in five types of floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies (i.e., permanent floodplain F0, 1-year floodplain F1, 5-year floodplain F5, 10-year flood plain F10, and 100-year floodplain F100) in the downstream of the Huolin River basin of China. A 30-day incubation experiment with three moisture treatments (i.e., 30%, 60%, and 100% water holding capacity (WHC)) was used to identify SOC mineralization processes and key influencing factors in these five floodplain wetlands. Our results showed that the topsoils (0-10 cm) contained significantly higher SOC contents than the subsurface soils (10-20 cm). The SOC contents followed the order of F5 > F0 > F1 > F10 > F100 and the order FO > F5 > F100 > F1 > F10 in the topsoils and subsurface soils, respectively, of five floodplain wetlands. The optimum moisture for the SOC mineralization of the topsoils was 30% WHC in F100, and 60% WHC in the other four wetlands. In the case of all the subsurface soils, 30% WHC was the optimum moisture for the SOC mineralization. The mineralization processes of SOC (especially the active carbon pool) could be better fitted by first-order kinetic models (R-2 > 0.98). The topsoils basically showed a lower C-0/SOC ratio (C-0: the potentially mineralized carbon) than the subsurface soils, except in the case of 60% and 100% WHC in F0 and F5. Under higher soil moisture conditions, the mineralization parameter k was significantly correlated with soil conductivity (p < 0.05). Under low soil moisture condition, C-0/SOC showed significant correlations with soil pH (p < 0.01). Our findings indicate that the change in the soil moisture of floodplain wetlands with different flooding frequencies could greatly affect the carbon pool of inland wetlands.

AB The SMAPVEX12 (Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Validation Experiment 2012) experiment was conducted during June-July 2012 in Manitoba, Canada with the goal of collecting remote sensing data and ground measurements for the development and testing of soil moisture retrieval algorithms under varying vegetation and soil conditions for the SMAP satellite. The aircraft based soil moisture data provided by the passive/active microwave sensor PALS (Passive and Active L-band System) has a nominal spatial resolution of 1600 m. However, this resolution is not compatible with agricultural, meteorological and hydrological studies that require high spatial resolutions and this issue can be solved by soil moisture disaggregation. The soil moisture disaggregation algorithm integrates radiometer soil moisture retrievals and high-resolution radar observations and it can provide soil moisture estimates at a finer scale than the radiometer data alone. In this study, a change detection algorithm was used for disaggregation of coarse resolution passive microwave soil moisture retrievals with radar backscatter coefficients obtained from the higher spatial resolution UAVSAR (Unmanned Air Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar) at crop field scale. The accuracy of the disaggregated change in soil moisture was evaluated using ground based soil moisture measurements collected during SMAPVEX12 campaign. The results showed that soil moisture spatial variabilities were better characterized by the disaggregated change in soil moisture estimates at 5 m/800 m resolution as well as a good agreement between disaggregated estimates and in situ measurements. It also showed that VWC (Vegetation Water Content) did not have a big impact on disaggregation algorithm performance, with R-2 of the disaggregated results ranging 0.628-0.794. The 5 m and 800 m resolution disaggregated soil moisture did no show significant difference in statistical performance variables.

AB The strong saline water intrusion in the North Branch of the Yangtze Estuary threatens the freshwater supply of the region in winter half year. Strong northerly winds have been identified as a factor increasing saline water intrusion. However, there are few studies on this subject, and the mechanisms of winds influencing saline water intrusion are still unclear. In the present contribution, we investigate the variation trend of strong wind events during cold outbreaks in winter half year and their correlation with saline water intrusion in the North Branch, together with the processes and mechanism of strong winds increasing saline water intrusion, based on observations and an analytical salt water intrusion model. The results indicate that the strong northerly and northeasterly wind events and saline water intrusion in the North Branch have similar variation trends in 1994-2008, both being relatively weak in the 1990s but being intensified dramatically after 1999. The significant correlation between these two trends suggests that the increase in strong wind events may be one of the factors inducing the enhanced saline water intrusion. Observations and model output show that the strong northerly and northeasterly winds can induce dramatic water level setup, increase of flood-tide current velocities, decrease of ebb-tide velocities, and decrease of freshwater inflow into the North Branch. These changes in combination cause the enhanced intensity of saline water intrusion. The Elanan transport from remote winds results in water level setup at the estuary mouth pumping more seawater into the North Branch, which should be a dominant mechanism inducing the change in hydrodynamics and increase of saline water intrusion.

AB Bayesian averaging of climate models is an important tool in streamflow predictions. Climate models have parametric and structural differences and thus have variable hydrological output. Performance of the individual climate models before they are averaged in a Bayesian framework should be consistent with their respective performance indices in a Bayesian framework to ensure that Bayesian averaging follows the physical process. Priors are required to compute posterior probability distributions in the Bayesian predictions. Robustness of Bayesian predictions therefore depends on use of a suitable prior. In this study, combinations of Bayesian regression model priors and regression parameter priors for streamflow prediction have been evaluated to investigate consistency of streamflow simulation performance of RCMs-individually outside the Bayesian framework, individually inside the Bayesian framework and collectively inside the Bayesian framework-using twelve widely used Bayesian formulations. The performance of RCM streamflow simulations outside the Bayesian framework is evaluated using widely used statistical indices: the Willmott's index of agreement (dl), root mean square error (RMSE), and percent bias error (PBIAS). The performance inside the Bayesian framework is evaluated using posterior inclusion probability (PIP). Results suggest that performance of climate models inside Bayesian framework may not be the same as that outside Bayesian framework. Therefore, there is need for climate model performance evaluation both inside and outside Bayesian framework as a precursor to Bayesian prior selection. For example, the non-Empirical Bayes g-Local (non-EBL)-based Bayesian priors give consistent climate model performance inside and outside Bayesian framework, and therefore is the best prior for simulating high flows. Based on the participating climate models in low flow modelling, the results suggest that both EBL and non-EBL priors can be used in averaging low flow in the Bayesian framework.

ID 2-PARAMETER GAMMA-DISTRIBUTION; CN; DERIVATION
AB The sediment graph models are useful for computation of sediment yield as well as total sediment out flow from watershed. In this study, the analytical development of proposed sediment graph models is based on Soil Moisture Accounting (SMA) procedure coupled Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number (SCS-CN) method, Nash's Instantaneous Unit Sediment Graph (IUSG)model and Power law. This coupling has led to the development of four sediment graph models (SGMs), i.e., SMA-SGM1, SMA-SGM2, SMA-SGM-3 and SMA-SGM4 depending on the four different hydrologic conditions as: (i) initial soil moisture (V-0) = 0 and initial abstraction (I-a) = 0, (ii) initial soil moisture (V-0) not equal OandinitialabstractionIa = 0, (iii) initial soil moisture (V-0) = 0 and (I-a) - 0, and (iv) initial soil moisture (V-0) not equal 0 and initial abstration (I-a) not equal 0, respectively. These models are applied on six natural watersheds with nineteen storm events having different land use/land cover, climatic condition (arid, semi-arid, humid and sub-tropical), rainfall and land slope conditions. The goodness-of-fit statistics is evaluated in terms of Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and relative error (RE) between observed and simulated (calibrated and validated) sediment graphs. Further, the performance of these models is also compared with the sediment graph model of Bhunya et al. (2010) (BSGM) on all the six study watersheds. It is found that the proposed models perform very well in simulating sediment yield generation process for all the watersheds and show significant improvement over the BSGM model.

AB The intensification of flooding in urban areas and the management of susceptibility areas has become a global issue and has been the subject of several studies in recent decades. The integration of alternative approaches, such as socio-hydrological and socio-technological sciences, has gained prominence in urban space planning and development. The mapping of environmental susceptibility represents a promising alternative for the integrated management of natural disasters. However, for this to be used as a socio-technological tool, transiting to a participative management of urban environment, it is necessary to simplify and reduce the associated costs. In this sense, the objective of this study was to propose a socio-technological tool for the punctual and spatial mapping of the susceptibility to the occurrence of flooding in urban regions. The method is designed to combine ease and low cost of application with a simplified but physically sensitive socio-hydrological assessment of eight factors of influence. The methodological tool was tested in a Brazilian district where entire socio-hydrological scenario of urban flooding in developing countries is observed. The results show that the method can provide a simple and consistent view, reaching an overall accuracy of 73.67% of the flooding points. In general, the method provides information that can support decision-making by government agencies in developed and developing countries, as well as civil society, in relation to participatory urban zoning, drainage management, and water conservation.

AB The rapid movement of water in a complex system of preferential pathways in soils is a common natural phenomenon. However, quantification of the properties of this phenomenon is not easy and such results are not often found in the literature. The paper presents results of quantification of the number of macropores, their relative volume and the ratio of water infiltrating through the macropores for five study sites with stony soils located in a mountain catchment of northern Slovakia. These characteristics were calculated from the saturated and unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivities under the assumptions of the Poiseuille's law. Saturated hydraulic conductivities were estimated by single ring infiltrometer measurements in the field and by falling head method in the laboratory. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivities were estimated by tension infiltration measurements in the field (using a minidisc infiltrometer, Decagon Devices). The largest amount of macropores (defined as the pores with radius larger than 1.5 ram) in the entire soil profile (7-5276 per 1 m(2)) was found at forest sites overgrown by spruce with high to extremely high stoniness. The number of macropores decreased with depth of the soil profile at all study sites. The contribution of macropore flow to water infiltration varied from approximately 63% to almost 100%. Although macropores can conduct a large proportion of water, their relative volume is small (0.001-0.9%). The relative volume of all macropores (active and non-active) estimated from the soil porosity and the water retention function was in the range 2-23%.

AB Among several components of the hydrology cycle, streamflow is one of the essential process necessarily needed to be studied. The establishment of an accurate and reliable forecasting soft computing model for this process is highly vital for water resource planning and management. The influence of the climatological environment on streamflow is central and studying its influence is very significant from the hydrology perspective. It has been noticed that the application of machine learning models considerably become predominant in solving and capturing the complexity of hydrological applications. This research presents the implementation of a novel hybrid model called Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline integrated with Differential Evolution (MARS-DE) to forecast streamflow pattern in semi-arid region. To achieve this, monthly time series streamflow data at Baghdad station, coordinated at Tigris River, Iraq, is inspected. For the model validation, Least Square Support Vector Regression (LSSVR) and standalone MARS models are conducted. To demonstrate the analysis of the undertaken models, several statistical indicators are computed to verify the modeling accuracies. Based on the achieved results, the MARS-DE model exhibited an excellent hybrid predictive modeling capability for monthly time scale streamflow in semi-arid region. Quantitatively; MARS-DE, LSSVR and MARS models achieved the minimum root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) values of 46.64-35.25 m(3)/s, 57.50-49.20 m(3)/s and 78.01-62.65 m(3)/s, respectively. In conclusion, several perspectives are suggested for further studies to enhance the forecasting capability of the model.

AB A riverine and overland flow model based on the dynamically adapting Galerkin Least-Squares finite element method is developed and presented. The method utilizes the diffusive wave equations within a dynamically adaptive mesh and second-order accurate implicit time stepping scheme to efficiently and accurately simulate problems involving flows such as those that occur during overland flooding and urban inundation. The developed method and the utility of dynamic mesh adaption is presented through the simulation of common problems that occur in urban and overland flow conditions, these are shallow flooding, rapid flooding and flow propagation in an urban area. The application of the method to the flooding of the Morganza floodway illustrates the capabilities of the model in simulating large scale flooding and the application to a large dam break illustrates the limitations of the diffusive wave equations and the flow regimes where the numerical assumptions for the method break down. To the author's knowledge, the unique combination of FEM, wet-dry scheme and dynamic mesh adaption for the solution of diffusive wave equation (DWE) has not been presented in literature prior to this study.

   DEPOSITION
AB Intertidal flats are shallow-water environments that undergo cyclical variations in water depth, leading to a frequent occurrence of extremely shallow water stages (ESWS; water depths < 0.2 m). However, relatively little is known about the hydrodynamic conditions and erosion-accretion processes during ESWS, because the water depth is too shallow to measure in situ sediment dynamic processes using traditional methods. To address this gap, based on in situ measurements with four advanced instruments, we quantified the hydrodynamic conditions, erosion and accretion during ESWS in calm weather conditions on a highly turbid intertidal flat in Jiangsu coast, China. Our results revealed that marked erosion and accretion occurred during ESWS at the flood and ebb tidal stages, respectively. The resulting bed-level changes were three times greater during ESWS than relatively deep water stages (RDWS; water depths > 0.2 m), and the rate of change was an order of magnitude faster than during RDWS. This larger and faster bed-level change occurred even though the ESWS duration only accounted for 10% of the entire tidal cycle. This result occurred because the bed shear stress due to combined current-wave action during ESWS, was, on average, two times higher than during RDWS at the flood stage causing more extensive erosion. Whereas during the ebb stage, this shear stress during ESWS was only half of that during RDWS resulting in greater accretion. The main implications of these results are that, because ESWS occur frequently (twice every tide) and are associated with large bed shear stress and bed-level changes, these conditions are likely to play an important role in morphological changes of intertidal flats. Our study shows that ESWS have a key influence on intertidal flat hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics. Thus our results are the basis for an improved understanding of the coastal morphodynamic processes on intertidal flats.

AB The conventional geo-accumulation index (GI) cannot deal with the uncertainty in the geochemical background information of pollutants or conduct a synthetic evaluation of heavy metal pollution in sediments. To solve these problems, a geo-accumulation vector (GV) model is designed based on uncertainty analysis theory. GV uses the probability vector to quantify the possibility for the pollution condition of a heavy metal to belong to a certain grade and then uses the first-order moment principle to determine its category. The GV model is applied in this study to evaluate heavy metal pollution in the sediments of Western Dongting Lake. The results show that (i) compared with the conventional GI model, the GV model has better capacity in evaluating synthetic pollution and in dealing with the uncertainty in the geochemical background information of sediments; (ii) the sediments of Li River estuary, Yuan River estuary, Songzi River estuary, and the central part of Western Dongting Lake are "moderately to heavily contaminated," "moderately to heavily contaminated," "moderately contaminated," and "uncontaminated to moderately contaminated" by heavy metals, respectively. These sediments also have 0.19, 0.36, 0.48, and 0.15 possibilities to deteriorate to the next category, respectively; and (iii) all deterioration risks are introduced by cadmium.

AB Hydrological responses of catchments to climate change require detailed examination to ensure sustainable management of both water resources and natural ecosystems. This study evaluated the impacts of climate change on water resource availability of a catchment in eastern Australia (i.e. the Manning River catchment) and analyzed climate-hydrology relationships. For this evaluation, the Xinanjiang (XAJ) model was used and validated to simulate monthly rainfall-runoff relationships of the catchment. Statistically downscaled climate data based on 28 global climate models (GCMs) under RCP8.5 scenarios were used to assess the impacts of climate changes on the Manning River catchment. Our results showed that the XAJ model was able to reproduce observed monthly rainfall-runoff relationships with an R-2 >= 0.94 and a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency >= 0.92. The median estimates from the ensemble of downscaled GCM projections showed a slight decrease in annual rainfall and runoff for the period 2021-2060 and an increase for the period 2061-2100. Annual actual evapotranspiration was projected to increase slightly, while annual soil moisture content was predicted to decrease in the future. Our results also demonstrated that future changes in seasonal and annual runoff, actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture are largely dominated by changes in rainfall, with a smaller influence arising from changes in temperature. An increase in the values of high runoffs and a decrease in the values of low runoffs predicted from the ensemble of the 28 GCMs suggest increased variability of water resources at monthly and seasonal time scales in the future. A trend of decreasing values in winter runoff and soil moisture content in the future is likely to aggravate possible future reductions in water availability in eastern Australia. These results contribute to the development of adaptive strategies and future policy options for the sustainable management of water resources in eastern Australia.

AB Analyzing the impacts of climate change on hydrology and future projections of water supplies is fundamental for the efficient management and planning of water resources in large river systems on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is known as the "water tower of Asia." However, large uncertainties remain in the projections of streamflow and glaciers in these cryospheric catchments due to great uncertainties in climate change projection and modeling processes. In this work, we developed an extended Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrological model (named VIC-CAS), which was coupled with glacier melting and glacier evolution schemes. A two-stage calibration procedure that used glacier inventory data and the observed streamflow was adopted to derive the model parameters. The calibrated VIC-CAS model was then used to assess the future change in glaciers and runoff using downscaled climate model data in the upstream regimes of the Yellow, Yangtze, Mekong, Salween, and Brahmaputra rivers on the TP. The results indicated that both temperature and precipitation were projected to increase, resulting in a greater than 50% decline of the glacier area by the end of the 21st century in the five catchments. Glacier runoff was already beyond its tipping point at the beginning of the 21st century with a greater than 20% loss of the glacier area except in the upstream of the Yangtze River, where glacier runoff was projected to decrease after the 2030 s. Annual streamflow was projected to increase significantly as a result of increased rainfall-induced runoff, compensating for the reduced glacier/snow melt water in the five major upstream river basins. The increasing rate of warm season streamflow was clearly less than that of annual runoff. A negative trend in warm season streamflow was expected if precipitation did not sufficiently increase. The annual hydrograph remained largely unchanged, except in the upstream of the Yellow River, where peak streamflow was predicted to occur 1 month earlier because of the earlier snowmelt and greater rainfall/precipitation ratio from May to June.

AB Although hydrological processes are generally nonlinear, linear time series models are commonly adopted in the field of water sciences. Nonlinear approaches such as threshold time series and conditional heteroscedasticity models are still seldom used. In this study, first, two- and three-regime Self-Exciting Threshold Autoregressive (SETAR) models are used to model the mean behavior of daily streamfiows. The residual time series computed from the difference between observations and lag-one time-ahead best-estimates of the fitted models are also obtained. Second, the conditional variance behavior of the residual series obtained from the two- and three regime SETAR models is modeled using the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model. The GARCH model is hence used to capture the time-varying variance behavior of residuals as a nonlinear phenomenon and thus it removes the existence of autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity so-called ARCH effect. Finally, the performance of SETAR models and their combination with the GARCH model are evaluated. Six deseasonalized daily streamflow series from upstream watershed rivers of Zarrineh Rood dam, in the southern part of Lake Urmia in Iran, are used to illustrate and test the procedure. The McLeod-Li test, a formal test for demonstrating the ARCH effect, indicates that the ARCH effect exists in all residual series, which means that the residuals of streamflow time series are nonstationary in terms of the variance. Results indicate that the hybrid SETAR-GARCH models performed better than the models without GARCH component. Results demonstrate also that the use of nonlinear SETAR and GARCH improves streamflow modeling efficiency by capturing the heteroscedasticity in the residuals of nonlinear threshold time series.

AB Nowadays there is a need to overcome the effects caused by rapid urbanization with more innovative methods. Recently, source control approaches, known as Low Impact Development (LID), are being used by urban planners to cope with water-related problems due to their cost-effectiveness and reliability. To do this, allocation of LID techniques in most suitable locations is done by introducing a new modeling tool called LID locator to the WetSpa-Urban software package and tested in the Watermaelbeek catchment situated in the Brussels capital region. In the first step, almost half of the catchment is eliminated from the implementation of LIDs by considering only pixels with high runoff. Also, by considering the sewer network behavior, the total area of high potential pixels for implementing LID is reduced to the range of 37% and 10% of the entire area of the catchment for different scenarios. In the next step, the selected area is further eliminated by use of suitable location algorithm based on size and other installation limitation of each type of LID. Then, the results are used as an input for the newly developed cost-optimization tool. In the end, the best scenario (10-year design storm with the current state of sewer network) is selected based on their performance in surface runoff volume reduction and the total cost. As a result, maximum flow and total volume at the outlet is reduced by 21 and 8% for the most cost-optimized scenario in January and February 2015. In addition to considering sewer network performance, land characteristics and LID installation limits for LID implementation, producing maps indicating the most cost-efficient locations and combinations for LIDS and visualizing them through the GUI make this tool a user-friendly product. This tool was applied to this case study in Brussels however it is applicable for other urban catchments.

AB In order to rationalize a surface water quality monitoring network (WQMN), it is critical to appropriately design surface water quality sampling locations. This is due to high installation, operational, and maintenance costs for each sampling representative of the whole water system conditions. The main objective of this study was to propose an integrated method to determine the most appropriate sampling points in the Khoy watershed northwest of Iran, where financial resources and water quality data are limited. Multi criteria evaluation method including analytic network process (ANP) and Fuzzy logic were incorporated in River Mixing Length (RML) procedure in order to identify exact locations of sampling points. Based on RML procedure, 15 candidate sampling points were identified to suitably select sampling points based on budget deficiency. Relative weights for 12 criteria and 10 sub-criteria related to non-point sources and surficial rocks as well as criteria of topography were then calculated by the ANP method. According to the obtained results, a new total potential pollution score (TPPS) was presented to prioritize 15 candidate sampling points. Then, the values of TPPS were classified and fuzzified to distinguish real differences between scores. Based on current monitoring stations and budget deficiency, the hierarchy value, and Fuzzy rank, six points are proposed as the most appropriate locations for surface water quality monitoring. Furthermore, four points are identified as the second most appropriate for enhancing a robust WQMN in the study area in order for an expansion plan in the future. The results of this study should be valuable for water quality monitoring agencies looking for an efficient approach for selecting exact sampling locations.

AB Climate change, in terms of changes in temperature and patterns of precipitation, has significant impacts on water resources and watershed ecosystems. Adapting to climate change is becoming an important strategy for watershed management. The goal of this study was to quantify the impacts of climate change on watershed hydrological processes and water quality, to evaluate the efficiency of Best Management Practices (BMPs) and the possible effects of a changing climate, and to configure cost-effective BMPs at sub-basin scale using a multi objective optimization method to mitigate climate effects on water resource. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was used to simulate the possible effects of changing climate on watershed hydrological and water-quality processes and adaptation options in the Miyun Reservoir Watershed (MRW). Climate change had significant impacts on water balance components such as precipitation, runoff, and evapotranspiration (ET) and on water-quality components such as sediment and nutrient loads. A substantial decreasing trend of runoff indicated that the Miyun Reservoir faced a more acute challenge of insufficient water-supply capacity. Compared with baseline climate, climate change represented by precipitation and temperature regimes resulted in substantial increases in sediment load (12.95%) and nutrient losses (7.26% for TN and 9.56% for TP) on average all sub-basins. Climate variability had significant effects on BMP efficiency through effects on watershed hydrology, soil erosion, and nutrient losses. Results highlight the importance of optimal configuration of site-specific BMPs at sub-basin scale for adaptation to climate change. The methods and findings presented here hold promise to enhance the resilience of the watershed system to current and future climate change.

AB Glacierised river catchments have been shown to be highly sensitive to climate change, while large populations depend on the water resources originating from them. Hydrological models are used to aid water resource management, yet their treatment of glacier processes is either rudimentary in large-scale applications or linked to fully distributed glacier models that prevent larger model domains. Also, data scarcity in mountainous catchments has hampered the implementation of physically based approaches over entire river catchments. A fully integrated glacier dynamics module was developed for the hydrological model SWIM (SWIM-G) that takes full account of the spatial heterogeneity of mountainous catchments but keeps in line with the semi-distributed disaggregation of the hydrological model. The glacierised part of the catchment is disaggregated into glaciological response units that are based on subbasin, elevation zone and aspect classes. They seamlessly integrate into the hydrological response units of the hydrological model. Robust and simple approaches to ice flow, avalanching, snow accumulation and metamorphism as well as glacier ablation under consideration of aspect, debris cover and sublimation are implemented in the model, balancing process complexity and data availability. The fully integrated model is also capable of simulating a range of other hydrological processes that are common for larger mountainous catchments such as reservoirs, irrigation agriculture and runoff from a diverse soil and vegetation cover. SWIM-G is initialised and calibrated to initial glacier hypsometry, glacier mass balance and river discharge. While the model is intended to be used in medium to large river basins with data-scarce and glacierised headwaters, it is here validated in the data-scarce catchment of the Upper Aksu River, Kyrgyzstan/NW China and in the relatively data-abundant catchment of the Upper Rhone River, Switzerland.

AB Crop yield patterns at the field level in dryland agricultural systems often trace back to the spatial structure of water storage and subsurface flow paths. These lateral flow paths create zones of saturation that promote nutrient loss from runoff and leaching beneath the root zone. Despite its clear importance, a spatially explicit representation of landscape hydrology is frequently missing from site-specific crop and fertilizer management plans. This work uses the grid-based water balance model, SMR (soil moisture routing), to adapt an established method of hydrologic classification, the Budyko framework, for small agricultural watersheds. The model was evaluated with spatially distributed soil moisture data and surface runoff measurements in four annually cropped fields located across the eastern Palouse region of the inland Pacific Northwest. The Budyko framework, modified to include change in root zone water storage and lateral flow, was combined with a separate indicator of yield potential to form a dual-threshold classification scheme for variable-rate fertilizer management that balances agronomic benefit with environmental impact. Each field was divided into zones based on crop yield and nitrogen loss potentials, which link to the hydrologic functioning of the landscape through soil water storage and subsurface redistribution, respectively. Results showed large variability in the annual water balance assessed within individual fields and between fields. The greatest variability was observed in the two eastern-most fields where the wettest zone of each had water supply 172% and 137% that of the dry zone. Depth to a hydraulic restrictive layer and topography were identified as primary landscape controls on the water supply (precipitation plus net lateral flow minus change in water storage) in these fields. Moreover, the steep climate gradient in the region created field-to-field variability in water balance with the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation ranging from 91% in the western-most field to approximately 70% in each of the fields to the east. The clearest choice is for growers to apply more fertilizer in areas with high water storage capacity and high crop yield and where fertilizer loss through leaching and runoff is minimal. Less fertilizer should be applied in areas with low water storage capacity that frequently saturate. Areas with high storage capacity and frequent saturation involve a tradeoff between yields and minimizing fertilizer loss that may be best served by splitting fertilizer application to avoid excessive over-winter leaching losses. Even though remote sensing and variable-rate applicators are at the frontiers of precision agriculture, landscape hydrology underlies all dryland crop production and should accordingly be looked to for inspiration in the design of cropping systems.

AB Spatially preferential flow processes occur at nested scales at the sediment-water interface (SWI), due in part to sediment heterogeneities, which may be enhanced in flashy urban streams with heavy road sand influence. However, several factors, including the flow-rate dependence of preferential hyporheic flow and discrete groundwater discharge zones are commonly overlooked in reach-scale models of groundwater/surface water exchange. Using a series of controlled-head tracer-injection experiments coupled with cm-scale geophysics within the highly reactive upper 30 cm of the hyporheic zone of an urban stream, we quantified the flow dependence of local less-mobile porosity volume, mass-transfer rate coefficient, and the resulting local residence time in the less-mobile pore space at three controlled downward fluid fluxes (0.8, 2, and 3 m/d). Experiments were performed in two adjacent streambed locations, representing different sediment bulk vertical permeability. Less-mobile porosity parameters were generally substantial and similar between the two streambed locations; though a more competent, thin, organic layer at similar to 15 cm depth in one location strongly impacted tracer loading, flushing dynamics, and local residence times. Increased downward flux led to (1) a decrease in less-mobile porosity residence time in all experiments, and (2) an increase in less-mobile porosity fraction for most experiments. Additionally, at the larger stream reach-scale, surface electrodes for electrical resistivity measurement were installed along 22 m of the wetted stream channel. These surface electrode measurements were collected during a natural storm flow event, which revealed widespread, short-term, flushing (e.g. < 3 h) of the hyporheic zone with stream water, followed by longer-term (e.g. > 60 h) flushing of the SWI with riparian zone groundwater. Flow dependence of preferential hyporheic zone flowpaths, like in the controlled tracer experiments, was also observed in these reach-scale electrical resistivity tomography measurements. Our findings reveal that the spatial and temporal dependence of preferential flow processes create highly dynamic SWI conditions that will affect the physical and coupled biogeochemical functions of the SWI in urbanized, sand-impacted streams.

AB An innovative approach was recently proposed to increase water depth and improve navigation in rivers by increasing overall roughness through an adaptive placement of artificial vegetation. In this approach, a section of the river width is covered with artificial vegetation constructed from an array of dampers that can be added or removed while maintaining sufficient width for navigational purposes. The goal of the work here is to explore the mean flow and turbulent momentum transport properties of such flow in a controlled flume setting, where the flow rate is steady, the vegetation placement is uniform, and the Froude number is maintained at sub-critical conditions. The focus is on vegetation-induced roughness alterations to the bulk flow statistics as well as the structure of turbulence impacted by the presence of such artificially engineered vegetation. The canopy flow experimentally explored here differs from the well-studied planar uniform emergent canopy flow because the interface between the vegetation and non-vegetation areas occurs along a lateral direction instead of the vertical direction. The flume experiments were conducted by partially covering the channel width with emergent artificial vegetation that is flexible and can interact with the flow. The quantities studied are the equilibration distance of the flow statistics from the leading vegetation edge as such distance is essential to any engineering design. Moreover, the mean flow and turbulence regimes at several longitudinal sections were analyzed using spectral analysis and conditional sampling to identify the main vortical structures and their contribution to momentum transport. Spectral analysis demonstrated that the sizes of the dominant vortices can be classified into stem-scale (small-scale) and shear-scale (larger scale) vortices as conventional in canonical canopy flows. The shear layer formed in the planar direction and its associated coherent vortices are spawned near the edge of the vegetated area in a manner analogous to a plane mixing layer. Quadrant analysis showed two contributions to the overall shear stress and lateral momentum exchange between the vegetated and non-vegetated zone, namely, ejections and sweeps. The measured ejection-sweep contributions are short-lived but significant to the overall turbulent momentum transport consistent with other canopy flow studies. Approximately 80% of the turbulent stress contributions at the interface occur within 30% of the time. Because the flume experiments were conducted at sufficiently high Reynolds number and sufficiently low Froude number, the scalability of the experimental findings here to much larger settings encountered in engineering practice are briefly discussed.

AB Human activities have exerted influential effects on the evolution of channels in river deltas throughout the world in recent decades. In this study, the adjustment processes of deltaic channels in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in response to diverse human interventions were examined during the 1960s-2010s. Changes in the channel geometries (i.e., cross- and longitudinal sections and at-a-station hydraulic geometry) indicate that channel evolution in the PRD can be divided into three periods since the 1960s, corresponding to stepwise changes in the hydrological processes in the PRD. During the 1960s-1980s period, channel topography showed slight change, mainly resulting from the variations in the water and sediment inputs, and hence at-a-station hydraulic geometry also displayed insignificant change. Such a kind evolution indicates a negligible impact from human interventions and an insignificant change in the hydrological processes in the PRD. From the 1990s to the early 2000s, the deltaic channels were substantially deepened, mainly due to large-scale sand excavation occurred in the PRD. And changes in at-a-station hydraulic geometry reveal an increase in the changing rate of the velocity with the discharge but a decrease for water depth and channel area. In response to channel deepening, the water level decreased but the tidal range increased at the Makou and Sanshui stations during this period. Furthermore, uneven down-cutting of the riverbed also significantly altered the divided water and sediment ratios in the PRD. After the prohibition of sand excavation (i.e., mid-2000s), although sediment reduction caused by dam construction was favorable for the further incision of deltaic channels, the incision magnitude was considerably decreased. In addition, we observe a relatively slight change in at-a-station hydraulic geometry. These results indicate an adjustment stage for the deltaic channels during this period. Correspondingly, the divided water and sediment ratios showed insignificantly change in the PRD, as did the water level and the tidal range. The results obtained from this study may help to set scientific guidelines for sustainable water management strategies for flood control, embankment protection, water and sediment regulation and prevention of salt-water intrusion in the PRD and other river deltas worldwide that are subject to strong human interventions.

AB The purpose of this study is to develop a flood warning system based on Atmospheric Ensemble Forecasts. Although ensemble forecasts are increasingly employed for flood forecasting, developing a flood warning system based on ensemble forecasts has not been adequately addressed yet. In this study, first a Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to forecast the heavy precipitation in Kan Basin, Iran. Ensemble storms were forecasted using five cumulus schemes including Kain-Fritsch, Betts-Miller-Janjic, Grell 3D ensemble, Multi-scale Kain-Fritsch and Grell-Devenyi ensemble cumulus scheme. Then, a Bayesian Networks (BN) was developed to estimate the flood peak using the atmospheric ensemble forecasts. Finally, a Fuzzy-TOPSIS (The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) model was prepared for making decisions for flood warning scenarios considering all effective factors in flood warning and uncertainty associated with them. Assessment of the proposed flood warning system was examined for various scenarios. It showed that when a significantly high probability was assigned to a warning level, that level had the maximum closeness coefficient and consequently chosen as a warning level. Yet, if the probability was distributed equally between some warning levels, the flood warning system acts cautiously since the decision-making model allocated the highest rank to the stronger warning level. Regarding the reasonable results of this study, applying the Fuzzy-TOPSIS model to develop a flood warning system based on atmospheric ensemble forecasts is recommended to apply in similar catchments for addressing the uncertainties.

AB Lakes impact atmosphere boundary layer processes and are thus important for catchment scale climate modeling and regional water and heat budgets. To explore the differences in lake-atmosphere interaction parameters, meteorological variables and turbulent heat fluxes in small and large water bodies, we collected eddy covariance observations and meteorological data during ice-free periods of the Lake small Nam-Co ("small lake") in 2012-2013 and Lake Nam-Co ("large lake") in 2015-2016 on the Tibetan Plateau. Significant differences exist in their lake-atmosphere interaction processes due to differences in their inherent attributes and environmental backgrounds. Relative to the "small lake", the maximum surface temperature of the "large lake" in summer is approximately 3 degrees C lower; "large lake" also has a larger wind speed, a higher monthly average air temperature and delayed peaks of the seasonal variation of water and air temperature. The typical values of the roughness length and standard bulk transfer coefficient for momentum are approximately 80% and 21% higher, respectively, for the "large lake". The typical values of the roughness lengths for heat and water are one order of magnitude lower in the "large lake" while the corresponding standard bulk transfer coefficients are only 7% lower. The latent and sensible heat fluxes of the two lakes have quite different seasonal variations, with evaporation peaking in November for the "large lake" and in June for the "small lake". The estimated evaporation during the ice-free season of the "large lake" (approximately 981 +/- 18 mm) is also higher than that (812 mm) of the "small lake" and this is mainly related to the observed lower Bowen ratio in the "large lake".

AB Water security has become a priority for adaptive policy and measures taken in response to climate change around the world. This is an opportunity and a challenge for the Taiwan government to establish a climate-resilient water supply portfolio to ensure water security. This study incorporated the costs of water production, intermittency, and carbon dioxide emission reduction, as well as the currently available water sources and how they will be affected by climate change, and applied optimal control theory to establish a cost-effective model to plan a long-term (2031) climate-resilient water supply portfolio for Taiwan. The study then uses the Penghu area as an empirical case study for this water supply portfolio. The results showed that desalination will become the major source of water, accounting for 71.81% of the water supply by 2031. However, this high proportion of desalination water will result in a significant increase in the unit cost of water production and the carbon footprint. Therefore, water demand management is also needed, and is recommended to ensure sustainable water resources in the Penghu area.

AB Transportation of carbon and nitrogen during rainfall events is highly important within karst ecosystems and has particular relevance to understand decoupling relation between carbon and nitrogen cycles. The ability of the karst ecosystem to sequester carbon is currently unknown but has potential to be an important residual terrestrial carbon sink. We hypothesis that the runoff response to rainfall events will vary according to whether the slope belongs to karst area, and carbon and nitrogen have imbalanced outputs response to runoff. Hence, a series of in-situ simulated rainfall experiments at three sites (two karst slopes with different carbonate matrixes and one non-karst slope without a carbonate matrix) were conducted in a typical karst zone in southwest China. We measured runoff discharge, and dissolved carbon and nitrogen during the experiments. The results show that the total runoff discharge increased positively with rainfall intensity, with the carbonate matrix making an important contribution to rainfall reallocation. The dissolved carbon loss from runoff plots is much higher than the dissolved nitrogen, with the dissolved C/N revealing the decoupling relation of carbon and nitrogen cycles in this critical karst zone. This initial carbon migrated by runoff at catchment scale is critical to carbon budgets in rivers. Furthermore, nitrogen leaching from the system is crucial as a nitrogen shortage at karst area in southwest China.

AB Mountain watersheds serve as important water sources for socioeconomic activities in semiarid and arid regions. This study examined the streamflow response to snow regime shifts associated with climate variability in the US Great Basin. To this end, the coupled hydro-ecological simulation system (CHESS), a process-based and distributed model, was applied to four mountain watersheds in the US Great Basin. Historical weather records for the period of 1961-1990 were used to spin-up model simulations so that the soil water and vegetation reached the equilibrium state under long-term climate conditions; the period of 1991-2015 was selected as the study period. The model evaluation suggested that CHESS was able to simulate major hydrological processes in the four mountain watersheds. In addition, it was found that annual streamflow was more strongly correlated with snowfall than with rainfall during 1991-2015 and increased by 0.62-0.76 mm as snowfall increased by 1 mm in the study regions. Recent regional warming advanced the timing of the peak flow and shifts in the snow regime also affected the intra-annual pattern of the soil moisture content. Seasonally, spring rainfall and snowmelt were dominant factors in generating spring streamflow and summer baseflow. The mechanisms for flow generation were more complex and more variable in the four watersheds in autumn and winter than in spring and summer. On an annual basis, shifts in snowmelt resulting from climate variability accounted for more than 60% of the variability in the annual streamflow, surpassing the contribution of rainfall in the four watersheds. Overall, our results suggest that shifts in the snow regime due to climate variability have important implications for the intra-annual distribution and availability of water resources in semiarid and arid regions of the US Great Basin.

AB This study aims to clarify groundwater and stream water flow systems in the Geum River basin, Korea, which is an area with a crystalline basement using delta O-18, delta H-2, and H-3. Stable isotopes of precipitation showed clear differences between dry and rainy seasons due to the Asian monsoon. Groundwater and stream water samples were collected in the dry and rainy seasons in three hydrographic zones of the upper, middle, and lower zones. The contribution of rainy season precipitation to groundwater recharge based on deuterium excess was 71-89%, far exceeding the amount fraction of the season in total precipitation. Stable isotopic compositions of groundwater and stream water showed little seasonal variation, and indicated the dominance of high-altitude recharge in the upper zone. Groundwater with lower H-3 was mainly observed in that area, indicating a contribution of intermediate flow with a longer residence time. In contrast, stream water and some groundwater samples in the lower zone showed seasonal variability and signatures of 10-20% evaporation in their stable isotopic composition. The H-3 content of groundwater in the lower zone was high, indicating that the local flow system is dominant. These regional features also influenced the relative contributions of rainy season precipitation, dry season precipitation, and local recharge with evaporation signature, as estimated from delta O-18 and deuterium excess values, and H-3 in groundwater. Stream water from lower-order streams of the river had stable isotopic compositions similar to those in the upper zone, indicating a considerable contribution of groundwater discharge in the mountainous areas to the lower reach of the river. These results have implications for sustainable management of water resources in the basin during predicted changes in water usage and precipitation patterns due to climate change, as well as in regions with similar climatic and hydrologic conditions.

AB General Circulation Models (GCMs) provide vital information on the likely future climate, much needed for the effective planning and management of water resources. The performance assessment of GCMs has received significant attention in recent years for reliable estimation of future climate. Even though many approaches have been trialled in the ranking of GCMs for the selection of an appropriate ensemble, there is still a need to explore the potential of the state-of-the-art ranking approaches for a more dependable selection of GCMs suitable for a given task, over a region of interest. The present study assessed the potential of a state-of-the-art feature selection method known as Symmetrical Uncertainty (SU) in ranking 20 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) GCMs based on their ability to simulate monthly precipitation and the monthly average of daily maximum and minimum temperature for annual, monsoon and winter seasons. The performance of GCMs was assessed using gridded climate data obtained from Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC), Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and Princeton Global Meteorological Forcing dataset (Prin) over the period 1961-2005 considering Pakistan as the study area. The ranks obtained with SU were compared with those obtained using two well-established ranking approaches; (1) Compromise Programming (CP) and (2) Wavelet-based Skill Score (WSS). According to the results of this study, for the simulation of all the three climate variables in all seasons; CESM1-CAM5, HadGEM2-AO, NorESIVM1-M and HadGEM2-ES were identified as the best GCMs by SU, whereas CESM1-CAM5, HadGEM2-AO, NorESM1-M and GFDL-CM3 were identified as the best GCMs by CP, and CCSM4, CESM1-CAM5, GFDL-ESM2G and HadGEM2-ES by WSS. The comparison of ranks of GCMs obtained using the same ranking approach but based on different gridded data products showed more or less similar ranks for a given GCM. However, the differences were noticeable when the ranking was conducted with the same gridded data but employing different ranking approaches. The approach presented in this study can be extended to any number of GCMs and can be applied over any region, for the identification of the best performing ensemble of GCMs for a set of climate variables.

AB The lack of knowledge on precipitation frequency over ungauged areas introduces a significant source of uncertainty in relevant engineering designs and risk estimation procedures. Radar-based observations offer precipitation information over ungauged areas and thus have gained increasing attention as a potential solution to this problem. However, due to their relative short data records and inherent uncertainty sources, their ability to provide accurate estimates on the frequency of precipitation extremes requires evaluation. This study involves the evaluation of at-site precipitation frequency estimates from NEXRAD Stage IV radar precipitation dataset. We derive precipitation annual maxima series from the 16yrs record (2002-2017) of NEXRAD and we compare against 539 long-term (50yrs) hourly gauge records. In addition, Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves are estimated from both radar and gauge dataset and compared. IDF estimation is based on fitting the Generalize Extreme Value distribution to annual precipitation maxima. Evaluation is carried out over the contiguous United States and results are grouped and presented for five dominant climate classes and for a range of return period and precipitation durations. NEXRAD was shown to overestimate intensities at shorter durations (1- and 3-h) and low quantiles, while it tends to underestimate higher quantiles at longer durations (24 h). In addition, evaluation of the IDF curves estimated from NEXRAD revealed a distinct geographic dependence with certain regions exhibiting a tendency to overestimation (e.g. east of the Rocky Mountains) or underestimation (Midwest). Overall, this analysis suggests that, while significant discrepancies may exist, there are several cases where NEXRAD provide estimates within the uncertainty bounds of the reference rain gauge dataset. The climate/geographic region and the temporal duration are important aspects to consider. Findings provided in this work on these aspects will hopefully serve as a general guideline for those interested in using NEXRAD estimates for further research or applications on precipitation extremes.

AB Floods around the world are having devastating effects on human life and property. In this paper, three Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) analysis techniques (VIKOR, TOPSIS and SAW), along with two machine learning methods (NBT and NB), were tested for their ability to model flood susceptibility in one of China's most flood-prone areas, the Ningdu Catchment. Twelve flood conditioning factors were used as input parameters: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), lithology, land use, distance from river, curvature, altitude, Stream Transport Index (STI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Stream Power Index (SPI), soil type, slope and rainfall. The predictive capacity of the models was evaluated and validated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC). While all models showed a strong flood prediction capability (AUC > 0.95), the NBT model performed best (AUC = 0.98), suggesting that, among the models studied, the NBT model is a promising tool for the assessment of flood-prone areas and can allow for proper planning and management of flood hazards.

AB Pump-and-treat (P&T) is a widely adopted technology for groundwater containment/remediation. Over the past decades, we have recognized that mapping aquifer heterogeneity, especially the low hydraulic conductivity (K) zones, has become an urgent need in remediation efforts. Meanwhile, many studies have proved that hydraulic tomography (FIT) utilizing groundwater responses from a series of cross-hole pumping tests is a viable technology for detailing hydraulic heterogeneity (high and low K zones) of aquifers. At a P&T field site, operation of pumping and injection wells often vary, creating changes in flow fields analogous to those in FIT surveys. Therefore, collecting groundwater monitoring data and analyzing them is tantamount to a cost-effective largescale FIT survey during P&T operations. To demonstrate this idea, water level data was collected at 41 wells for one year at the U.S. Air Force Plant 44 (AFP44) P&T site in Tucson, Arizona, where the pumping and injection rates of the P&T system were changed many times during the year. This dataset was analyzed with a geostatistical inverse model to estimate the hydraulic property distribution, which can reasonably predict the pressure responses of the site under different conditions. Moreover, we showed that large-scale geological information, built based on 245 borehole logs at the site, could improve the model calibration performance through a two-step calibration procedure. Additionally, we used synthetic experiments to verify that the use of a larger variety of P&T configurations can yield non-redundant FIT information, and enhance site characterization. Overall, we demonstrated that the proper scheduling of pumping and injection operations at a P&T site and collecting corresponding groundwater responses are equivalent to conducting a large-scale HT survey, with minimal additional costs.

AB This work investigates the potential of using the Bayesian-based Model Conditional Processor (MCP) for complementing satellite precipitation products with a rainfall dataset derived from satellite soil moisture observations. MCP - which is a Bayesian Inversion approach - was originally developed for predictive uncertainty estimates of water level and discharge to support real-time flood forecasting. It is applied here for the first time to precipitation to provide its probability distribution conditional on multiple satellite precipitation estimates derived from TRMM Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis real-time product v.7.0 (3B42RT) and the soil moisture-based rainfall product SM2RAIN-CCI. In MCP, 3B42RT and SM2RAIN-CCI represent a priori information (predictors) about the "true" precipitation (predictand) and are used to provide its real-time a posteriori probabilistic estimate by means of the Bayes theorem. MCP is tested across Italy during a 6-year period (2010-2015) at daily/0.25 deg temporal/spatial scale. Results demonstrate that the proposed methodology provides rainfall estimates that are superior to both 3B42RT (as well as its successor IMERG-early run) and SM2RAIN-CCI in terms of both median bias, random errors and categorical scores. The study confirms that satellite soil moisture-derived rainfall can provide valuable information for improving state-of-the-art satellite precipitation products, thus making them more attractive for water resource management and large scale flood forecasting applications.

AB Single-well injection tests in a petroleum-contaminated region stimulate microbial growth and cause bioclogging because of the intrusion of elevated dissolved oxygen (DO), which may affect the hydraulic conductivity (K) estimation. In this study, we developed a mathematical model considering multispecies and multiphase reactive transport and bioclogging for a single-well injection test in a confined aquifer to investigate the microbial effects on parameter estimation. The finite-difference method was used to solve the model. The temporal heads in the injection well in both cases of clean and petroleum-contaminated aquifers were compared. The results indicated that the bioclogging led to an abnormal bulge of the drawdown-time curve at an intermediately late time of injection. Based on sensitivity analysis and Cooper-Jacob straight-line fitting associated with the least square method, the underestimation degree of K was 17.7% with default parameters, 11.9% with double injection rate Q, 31.1% with double maximum biomass growth rate mu(maxJ) and 39.5% with double initial contaminant concentration C-2(ini). Moreover, introducing an approximate Damkohler number indicated that increasing Q reduced the underestimation by flushing and diluting the essential materials for microbial growth to the downstream and that larger C-2(ini) and mu(maxJ) resulted in an increase in underestimation due to the increase in favorable conditions and strong growth ability of microbes. Finally, we suggest that when petroleum contamination is inevitable in a single-well injection test, moderate increases in Q and the test duration can reduce the underestimation degree of K to a considerable extent.

AB yy Groundwater serves as a significant freshwater supply for coastal regions. In many coastal areas, extensive islands have been created by filling the sea. These reclaimed islands not only provide valuable space for urban development, but also can serve as valuable aquifers. Recharge of fresh water from rainfall can flush out salt water and eventually create a freshwater lens beneath the reclaimed island. However, how a fresh groundwater lens grows in reclaimed islands and the factors that control its growth are unclear. Here we use a series of three-dimensional density-dependent flow-and transport models to investigate the process of fresh-salt water mixing and quantify the potential maximum volume of fresh groundwater that can occur beneath reclaimed islands. Our results show that the recharge rate controls the growth rate and the initialization of the fresh groundwater lens, whereas the permeability of the underlying fill materials and bedrock determines the shape of freshwater lens beneath the island but has a minor influence on freshwater volume. Increasing porosity enlarges the total water volume but diminishes the proportion of fresh water as the larger volume of original salt water in the aquifer requires more recharge to flush and dilute; longitudinal dispersivity promotes the fresh-salt water circulation in a certain range but limits the maximum fresh volume storage, and vertical transverse dispersivity facilitates extending mixing areas to enlarge the freshwater lens. Heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity field increases the variability of groundwater flow, restricts the average speed of fresh-salt water circulation, and results in a decrease in the growth rate and maximum volume of the freshwater lens. Our study has large implications for planning and management of reclaimed lands for water sustainability In the future in coastal areas.

AB Desert oases exist around the alluvial fans of inland river basins in arid areas, where the vegetation growth is wholly dependent on groundwater due to scanty rainfall and arid environment. Climate change and water resources exploitation may threaten the groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) in the arid areas; a case study was proposed to evaluate the vegetative growth state with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), hydrometeorological data, and the exploitation of water resources of the Nalenggele alluvial fan in northwest China. Climate change, and increasing temperature and precipitation may be indispensable factors for vegetation growth; however, based on the results of a correlation analysis, it was found that climatic factors shared little direct correlation with the NDVIs of the Nalenggele alluvial fan. Also, the depth to groundwater table (DWT) and distribution of shallow groundwater (DSG) are the direct influencing factors of vegetation growth. DWT and DSG are mainly controlled by the groundwater recharge mechanism and the original water sources from snowmelt, which are directly correlated with climate change. Predictions for DWT and DSG were made considering water resource exploitation and different river discharges amid climate change. The results reveal that the distribution area of shallow groundwater with the ecological water level (DWT < 4 m) in 2020 will decrease to approximately 78-86% of that in the status quo year, which suggests vegetation may be at risk of degradation from the combined influence of climate change and human activities.

AB Sources of water used by plants in rock-dominated environments are far less clear than those in relatively homogeneous soils, largely because plants in rocky environments normally expose to more complex substrate conditions and their potential water sources are hard to locate and sample. In the current study, potential water sources for plants growing on cliff-face (a typical kind of rock-dominated environment) were roughly separated into two water pools based on their hydrological differences. A variable pool that is composed of water derived from recent precipitation that has rapid fluctuations in water content due to recharge by precipitation and depletion by transpiration, and a constant pool that is characterized by slower changes in water status because it can only be recharged by precipitation under certain conditions and depleted by transpiration of deep-rooted species. This study was conducted in a typical karst catchment of Northwest Guangxi, Southwest China. Stem water samples for the most common dominant tree species of cliff-faces and rainwater for each rain event were consecutively collected throughout the growing season. A co-occurring shrub species, which was identified to have a shallow root system, was further selected as a reference species. The reliance on different water pools was qualitatively identified based on the deviation of stem water isotope values between current and last sampling times, as well as its relationship to the isotope values of rainfall between these two sampling times. Our results showed that the shrub species continuously relied on water from the variable water pool, which was consistent with its shallow root system. While the dominant tree species shifted from the constant pool during the early wet season to the variable pool during the mid-wet season, then back to the constant pool during the early dry season. Moreover, the divergent reliance on different water pools by the two species was further supported by the species-specific dynamics in the efficiency in water use by various plants (reflected by leaf carbon isotope ratio). Our results provide new insights into the linkages between plant transpiration and hydrologically different water pools, which would be helpful in understanding the hydrological importance of different plant species.

AB A set of closed-form series solutions that account for the transient and steady-state responses of excess pore water pressure and total settlement to one-dimensional consolidation in saturated soils exposed to various typical types of time-dependent external loading with any desired excitation amplitude and period is symmetrically formulated based on the theory of poroelasticity. The mathematical approach developed in the current study is quite general so that it can be straightforward extended to arbitrary waveform shapes of harmonic loading after they are simply represented in terms of Fourier trigonometric series. These solutions are numerically calculated to evaluate variations in excess pore water pressure and total settlement due to vertical consolidation in saturated soils with two very different magnitudes of intrinsic permeability, Soil A (higher) and Soil B (lower), as representative examples using two illustrative periods per cycle. Our results show that within excitation frequencies we examined, the excess pore water pressure exhibits greater cyclic swings in Soil B than that in Soil A as harmonic stress compression and relaxation are added, but an inverse trend is observed for total settlement. As compared to static external loading, the excess pore water pressure persists longer with periodic fluctuation in the presence of cyclic loading, but less total settlement is induced in Soil B. The discrepancy in the latter (total settlement) between the static and cyclic loading is most significant in Soil B, reflecting a physical implication that low permeability leads to a slower dissipation of excess pore water pressure, thus causing less settlement with time.

AB Realistic representation of surface states using the land surface model (LSM) is extremely challenging owing to human-induced changes and uncertainty in forcing data. In this study, we focus on two crucial objectives pertaining to hydrology namely (a) to understand the ability of different soil moisture (SM) products to improve simulation of unmodeled irrigation processes through data assimilation process, and (b) to learn the feasibility of these SM products to correct the spatial surface soil moisture artifacts caused due to error in precipitation forcing. The utility of SM products evaluated in the present study are retrieved from different satellite sensors and algorithms such as the active satellite-based the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), merged SM from European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI V4.2) and the latest passive microwave-based SMOS INRA-CESBIO (SMOS-IC) SM product. The results presented for three years (2010, 2011 and 2012) suggest that assimilation of ASCAT and CCI based products effectively captures the SM changes due to irrigation. Similarly, it corrects the spatial artifacts caused due to precipitation errors. However, the single sensor based products have a limitation in spatial samples per day which is critical to capture dynamic SM products over a larger area. Hence, blended products are more effective on a larger area to capture the dynamics in a more effective manner at daily temporal resolutions.

ID SUSPENDED-SOLIDS; CONTROL STRATEGY; RAINFALL; STREAM; AREA; EFFICIENCY;

AB Stormwater detentions basins are designed to capture stormwater to reduce and delay peak flows and to improve water quality. A novel technology proposed to improve basin performance is real-time, active control of the basin outflow, in so-called "smart" stormwater systems. Existing studies demonstrate the performance of active controls that respond in real-time to basin water level, detention time, and rainfall forecast for one or a small number of rainfall events. We hypothesize that the performance of these active controls can be improved by incorporating real-time water quality data into the control algorithm. In addition, we hypothesize that active control performance depends on hydrologic variability, specifically the frequency and intensity of runoff inputs. In this paper, we test these hypotheses using a numerical modeling framework for systems-level reliability analysis of active and passive stormwater basin outflow control using a Monte Carlo method. The analysis is performed using the urban hydrology model EPA-SWMM driven by stochastic rainfall time-series generated from the Modified Bartlett-Lewis Rectangular Pulses Model. Water quality-informed real-time active control algorithms are developed, tested, and shown to display an improvement over traditional, passive (no control) systems and other storage-based active controls for water and pollutant capture. Seasonal and duration curve analysis showed that water level- and water quality- informed control performance varied for different storm return periods and this variability could partly be attributed to the fraction of time the valve is closed. In addition, control performance was sensitive to rainfall variability, generally decreasing as storms become less frequent and more intense. Therefore, control system performance may depend on seasonal and longer time scale variability in climate and rainfall-runoff processes. We anticipate this study to be a starting point to incorporate theories of reliability to assess detention basin and conveyance network performance under more complex real-time control algorithms and failure modes.

AB Protecting karst aquifers from nitrate contamination is an issue of global concern due to the inherent vulnerability of karst aquifers to contamination and the negative health effects of elevated nitrate levels. Hydrological and transport models were developed to assess nitrate transport within a karstic aquifer located in an area with both semi-arid and sub-humid climate conditions. Groundwater flow through the aquifer matrix and conduits was simulated with CFPv2, an experimental version of the Conduit Flow Process (CFP) version of the MODular FLOW (MODFLOW) groundwater model. Nitrate transport was simulated with the experimental Conduit Mass Transport Three-Dimensional Model (CMT3D). The hydrologic calibration of the steady-state model was successful based on a scaled Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 4.9% for hydraulic heads and percent errors of 3.0% and 6.6% for the two major springs in the area. Performance of the transient hydrologic model exceeded the performance of the existing Equivalent Porous Media (EPM) model with a scaled RMSE of 2.2% and springflow errors of 1.5% and 2.8% for the major springs. Similarly, nitrate calibration was successful with all Percent Bias (PBIAS) values between +/- 25%. Additional calibration statistics including a two-tailed t-test indicated successful calibration. The CMT3D model corroborates prior research findings that anthropogenic sources as well as biogenic wastes are important sources of nitrate to the aquifer. The methodology used in this study represents an additional tool for watershed managers to address nitrate contamination within karst aquifers.

AB Presented in this paper is a theoretical and numerical analysis for active particles in a fully developed steady wetland flow dominated by the free-surface effect. An ecological risk assessment model for the concentration distribution of active particles is devised as an extension of the general form of concentration transport equation for passive particles in wetland flows. The vorticity in the free-surface wetland flow is found to depend on the dimensionless parameter alpha, which reflects the combined action of vertical momentum dispersion, microscopic curvature of flow passages, friction of vegetation and water depth. The large alpha results in the decrease of vorticity at the free surface and the increase at the bed bottom. The analytical solution of stable concentration distribution is rigorously derived for the active particles in both weak and strong vortical flows, under the combined action of the effective mass dispersion by the ambient flow, as well as the translational diffusion and vertical swimming by the active particles. It is found that the strong vorticity weakens the concentration of active particles in the free surface wetland flow, while the strong diffusion, by the wetland flow and active particles, enhances the concentration. The large alpha results in the increase of concentration near the free surface and the decrease of concentration near the bed bottom. The time scale for active particles to reach the stable concentration distribution is mainly dependent on the dimensionless parameter, Pe, which reflects the relative strength of the vertical swimming and the total diffusion due to the wetland flow and the active particles.

AB A single fracture is the basic unit of fracture medium, and the roughness of the fracture surface is an important factor influencing hydraulic characteristics of the flow in bedrock fracture. However, effects of the shape and density of roughness elements (various bulges/pits on rough fracture wall surfaces) on water flow in a single fracture have not been thoroughly understood. Thus the water flow in a single fracture with different shapes and densities of roughness elements was simulated by using Fluent software in this study. The results showed that the existence of roughness elements could enhance the flow resistance and cause nonlinear flow. The shape difference of roughness elements, i.e. the value variation of the included angle between the tangent direction of the beginning of roughness element and the streamline direction, could change their influence degree on the flow regime. Increasing the density of roughness elements could bring more violent turbulent, reduce the relative aperture of fracture, and decrease the discharge per unit width correspondingly. With the increase of flow velocity, Forchheimer equation could fit the relationship between average velocity and hydraulic gradient better than Izbash equation. In addition, the variation of flow regime in rough fracture from laminar flow to turbulent flow was a process of the gradual dominance of inertial force.

AB Forest ecosystem plays a major role in controlling moisture dynamics over the continents, particularly in the humid tropics. The montane forest ecosystem in South India supports a characteristic warm tropical climate which affects the weather pattern and the monsoon system. This study focuses on better understanding of the influence of dual monsoonal rainfall on the surface water and groundwater in south-west India, and the role of the Western Ghats mountain belt in governing the water isotope characteristics (i.e., isotopic elevation, rainfall amount and continental effects) in the humid tropics of South India. This is achieved through a spatial study of stable isotope ratios of surface and subsurface water (oxygen, delta H-2 and hydrogen, delta H-2), collected from different tropical river basins located between Kozhikode (Kerala, 10 degrees 30' N) and Udupi (Karnataka, 13 degrees 30' N), in the wettest places and highest peaks of the Western Ghats between 2011 and 2014. The results on stable isotope ratios of ground water, river water and springs show that the water from the tropical mountain belt of the Western Ghats exhibit a low elevation effect with an isotopic lapse rate of 0.09 parts per thousand/100m for delta O-18 up to 2050 m asl. Beyond 2050 m asl, a considerable effect of elevation with an isotopic lapse rate of 2.5 parts per thousand/100 m for delta O-18 is observed. The water samples from the Nilgiri ranges (1950-2300 m asl) exhibited higher isotopic lapse rate of 1.5 parts per thousand/100 m for delta O-18 unlike that of the mountains (Ezhimala, Agumbe and Chembra) close to the eastern Arabian Sea. The difference in isotopic lapse rate is mainly dependent on (i) the dominating seasonality of oceanic source moisture over the subcontinent leading to higher depletion of heavy isotopes for more inland groundwater during the winter monsoon on the eastern slopes of the Western Ghats (ii) the degree of terrestrial moisture feedback mechanisms along windward slopes of the Ghats belt (i.e., Arabian Sea coast of India) leading to relative enrichment of heavy isotopes in groundwater fed by the highly recycled vapour sources rather than depletion due to amount, elevation or continental effect, and iii) deep cooling of orographically uplifted air moisture at high elevations of inland tropical mountains. The observed isotopic elevation effect on the groundwater and surface water is unique and constrained by specific time scale and mountain ranges within the Western Ghats belt. This study provides new understanding on factors controlling hydrological budget along higher parts of the Western Ghats mountain belt in South India experiencing humid tropical climate.

AB Hydrological modeling has provided key insights into the mechanisms of land-use change impacts on runoff. However, the uncertainty of this impact is poorly understood. This paper examines the uncertainty originated from hydrological models' parameters and structure in simulating hydrological responses to land use change on daily, monthly and annual time scales. Two hydrological models, SWAT and HSPF, were applied to simulate the runoff response in the Xitiaoxi basin of eastern China. The effects of three land use scenarios (in 1985, 2002 and 2014) were analyzed with respect to the expansion of urban areas and reduction of cropland and forests. The changes in streamflow with multi-timescales between two models were compared at the whole basin and the sub-basin scales. The parameter uncertainty was estimated based on a sequential uncertainty analysis method (SUFI-2). The results indicate that the two models (SWAT and HSPF) could reproduce the observed daily and seasonal flows well, but they cannot accurately reconstruct the extreme flows (such as annual 7-day minimum discharge, R_7dMIN). The effect of parameter uncertainty on streamflow varies over time scales. The simulated annual and monthly runoff change values show large discrepancies but with same trends. The simulated changes for annual maximum discharge (R_1dMAX) and R_7dMIN often show different signs. The average width of the predictive interval in the relative change of different flow characteristics exceeded 100% of the average relative changes for both models. HSPF tends to present larger relative changes for the annual and monthly runoffs compared to SWAT. Moreover, the model choice could affect the direction change in R_1dMAX and R_7dMIN. However, when land use change was significant to a certain degree, both models simulated increased R_ldMAX and decreased R_7dMIN, but with different significance levels. The study suggests that the model structure represents an additional uncertainty, which should be accounted for in the land-use change impact assessment.

AB The choice of data periods for calibrating and evaluating conceptual hydrological models often seems ad-hoc, with no objective guidance on choosing calibration periods that produce the most reliable predictions. We therefore propose to systematically investigate the effects of calibration and validation data choices on parameter identification and predictive performance. We demonstrate our analysis on the Deggendorf/kollbach catchment in Bavaria, Germany, for its long series of continuous hydrological and meteorological records. After classifying these data into three hydrological conditions (wet, dry and mixed) and combining them into periods of varied data length (2, 4, 8, 15, 20 and 25 years), we repeatedly calibrate a conceptual rainfall runoff hydrological model - Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) to these distinct data sets via Bayesian updating in a Monte Carlo setting. Then, we analyze predictive performance and posterior parameter statistics in various validation periods of distinct hydrological condition and time-series length. We call this the Comprehensive Differential Split-Sample Test (CDSST). Our results suggest that hydrological conditions in calibration tend to have a stronger impact than time-series length, and that calibrating on dry conditions might be a robust choice when aiming at predicting arbitrary future conditions (wet, dry or mixed). Furthermore, we found that posterior parameter estimates converged to a common optimum range with increasing data size under all investigated calibration scenarios, indicating that compensation of model structural errors by parameter fitting is independent of the chosen calibration condition. However, calibrating on time-series 8 years or longer led to overconfident predictions that failed to reliably envelope future data. While these findings are specific to our case study, we recommend using the CDSST to stress-test conceptual hydrological models to identify robust model parameters and/or deficiencies in the model structure. In general, we expect our proposed approach to be a valuable basis for model error diagnosis in any type of dynamic environmental system model, because it answers the following three questions: (1) what is the importance of physical processes not explicitly covered by the model? (2) How much overconfidence is present in the model? And (3), what are case-specific recommendations for appropriate calibration and validation setups?

TI Groundwater quality monitoring network design and optimisation based on
   measured contaminant concentration and taking solute transit time into
   account
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PESTICIDE ATTENUATION; AQUIFER; SYSTEMS; AGE; AID
AB Groundwater quality monitoring networks are designed to give the best possible overview of the quality status and trend of aquifers from a limited number of measurement stations. Ideally, the stations of the network should (i) allow the detection of significant changes in water quality, either improvements due to successful mitigation measures, or deteriorations caused for instance by land use change or other increasing pressure and (ii) approximate closely the true unknown mean concentration of the considered aquifer. If these two features are met, the monitoring network is representative of the entire aquifer. In this article, we present a method with which to assess and improve the representativeness of a regional groundwater monitoring network. The method is designed specifically to optimize the selection of monitoring stations from a larger choice of fixed locations such as springs or existing observation wells using one contaminant for the optimisation procedure. Firstly, the empirical distribution of selected solutes (contaminants and age tracers) is calculated from a large dataset consisting of as many sampling points as possible and compared to the distributions obtained solely from the stations of the existing or planned monitoring network. If differences are large, the network is modified by adding new stations or replacing some of them, using one contaminant for the optimisation. Lastly, the distribution of the optimised network is compared to the total distribution for other contaminants and one groundwater age tracer.
   The use of the method is illustrated for the main aquifer of the country of Luxembourg, where it is shown that the representativeness of the current monitoring network can be improved by replacing two stations. In the case study, the optimisation was based on desethyl atrazine, a ubiquitous pesticide transformation compound which was assumed to be an indicator of diffuse agricultural pollution. Although the largest improvement was obviously obtained for the optimised compound, improvement was also observed for other contaminants, including nitrate, probably showing that at the regional scale, the pattern of diffuse pollution of widely used agrochemicals is similar between compounds. The temporal evolution of the major contaminants could also be reproduced by the optimised network, even though the range of tritium values used as age tracer was narrower for the modified network than for the original network, thus indicating some bias towards faster reaction times.

AB Rainfall-runoff processes in the karst dominated regions are of great importance. However, not all areas in a karst-dominated river basin are covered by typical limestone and both limestone and soil cover may exist. This study proposes a coupled conceptual hydrological model for simulating the rainfall-runoff processes in karst-dominated areas. The model, named as K-XAJ, couples the traditional Xinanjiang (XAJ) model and a two reservoir-based karst model for simulating runoff in both the karst area and the non-karst area in the Lijiang River basin. Simulated results demonstrated that the proposed K-XAJ model satisfactorily simulated the rainfall-runoff processes. Compared with the traditional XAJ model, the K-XAJ model produced better forecasts. The peak flow predicted by the K-XAJ model was larger than that by the XAJ model, but the interflow routed by the K-XAJ model was significantly smaller than that by the XAJ model. The magnitude of groundwater predicted by the K-XAJ model was greater. This study thus provides a new way to simulate rainfall-runoff processes in karst areas.

AB In deep excavation engineering, the head of the confined aquifer below the excavation bottom must be lowered when the anti-uprush safety factor is not satisfied. However, the drawdown of the confined aquifer may cause ground settlement around the excavation and endanger adjacent buildings, tunnels or municipal pipes. Artificial recharge (AR) is a measure that has been applied in such situations to recover the water level and control the settlement. However, practical engineering cases have shown that AR could control only the development of settlement and could hardly recover the settlement caused by long-term dewatering. Therefore, three recharge schemes, namely, "recharge first", "simultaneous pressure relief and recharge" and "pressure relief first", are studied using numerical modeling. The results show that the opening timing of the recharge wells and pressure relief wells has a significant impact on the final settlement. In different recharge schemes, different stress paths of the soil in the confined aquifer and overlying aquitards cause different plastic compressive deformations. To reduce plastic deformation, recharge should begin at the same time as pressure relief when the surrounding environment of the deep excavation must be strictly protected. Additionally, the case study and numerical simulation both show that the most significant settlement or uplift occurs in the deep soil layer rather than at the ground surface, a phenomenon that occurs because the vertical displacement of the soil adjacent to the relief and recharge wells is larger than that in the soil far away, leading to a vertical soil arching in the strata above the confined aquifer.

AB River flows exert dominant controls on in-stream biota. Quantifying linkages between hydrology and biology is important for assessing the effects of flow alteration on ecological functions. Hydrologic models are often used to quantify these flow-ecology relationships and guide management actions. Traditional model calibration techniques typically focus on a best overall fit criterion that may not be suitable for environmental flow applications where certain elements of the flow regime exert a dominant influence on biotic composition. We present an approach for hydrologic model calibration that improves the accuracy of calculated flow metrics known to be significant drivers of ecosystem response. First, we developed regional flow-ecology relationships based on streamflow gage and benthic macroinvertebrate data from southern California to determine which streamflow metrics best explain variability in taxonomic and trait-based biotic indices. Next, we developed and calibrated a series of hydrologic models to minimize error in these important flow metrics. For our study sites, flow flashiness and low flow frequency (indicative of drying) were found to best explain biotic condition. Hydrologic models calibrated specifically to minimize errors in these flow metrics predicted macroinvertebrate indices better than models calibrated to maximize fit to the overall flow regime. This ecological-calibration approach requires some a priori knowledge of flow-ecology relationships, but it produces results that can improve assessment of the impacts of changing flow regimes on biota and guide the development of strategies to mitigate ecological degradation.

AB A novel form of coupled curvilinear lattice Boltzmann model (CCLBM) for solving the solute transport in shallow water flows, imposed by the complex geometry, is developed and applied. Shallow water equations, transformed into curvilinear coordinate system, are solved using the lattice Boltzmann equation with multiple-relaxation-time (MRT-LBM), while the curvilinear form of the 2D advection-diffusion equation is solved applying the Bhatnagar-Gmss-Krook (BGK-LBM) approach. Corresponding forms of equilibrium distribution function for both the shallow water and the advection-diffusion equation is derived using the D2Q9 lattice. The physical flow domain of arbitrary geometry in the horizontal plane is covered with adequate curvilinear mesh, while the calculation procedure for flow and transport is carried out in the D2Q9 square lattice, applying the basic form of the boundary condition method on water-solid and open boundaries as well. The coupled flow and pollution transport is tested using a straight inclined channel, irrigation channel with a parabolic cross section in a 90 degrees bend, and a segment of the Danube River. In the cases of the straight inclined channels analytic solution is used as a comparative base, while for the bent channel previously obtained velocity measurements are utilized for flow calibration, where a mathematical model based on traditional CFD procedures is used for pollution transport validation. Unsteady flow and salinity transport in the Danube River is calibrated and modelled using velocity and salinity measurements, along with the results obtained by the traditionally based CFD model. The high level of agreement between the results obtained by the proposed model and the corresponding analytical values and measurements indicates that the presented curvilinear form of the LBM is capable of solving very complex environmental problems.

AB River confluences are key features of a river network, and their effects on contaminant transport and transformation need to be understood to control the contamination of a river network. This paper investigates the dynamic characteristics of phosphorus (P) contamination on the surface sediment at a river confluence of the Huai River, China, where water and sediment contamination is severe. The results highlight that P contamination of the surface sediment at a river confluence is more severe than that of the main stream of the river network to which the river confluence belongs. Floods have critical impact on the transport of sediment and its surface texture. In the annual water cycle the initial small flood can convey much more contaminated sediment and pollute the downstream river, whereas the subsequent large flood leads to the coarsening of the surface sediment and decrease of the total P (TP) content on the surface sediment (TPS). Water temperature is one of the most important factors affecting the temporal variability of the TPS at the river confluence. Higher P amounts are adsorbed on the surface sediment during lower water temperatures in winter and spring. Calcium bound P (Ca-P) is a relatively stable fraction of the sedimentary P during the dynamic processes of contamination of the surface sediment, and the nonapatite P gets released from the surface sediment during the summer. Effects of P concentration of the surface water and that of pH on TPS variability are not discernable in the current study. These results will be useful for controlling phosphorus contamination at river confluences and in river networks.

AB As a typical wet island in arid Central Asia, the Ili Valley located in northwestern China provides water resources for the oasis in the lower reaches. However, it is not clear whether its unique climatic characteristics will lead to different isotopes of precipitation and what is the major factor controlling the variation of precipitation isotopes in this region. Based on three sites spread over the Ili Valley, 297 precipitation samples were collected from May 2015 to April 2016. The delta O-18 and delta D values range from -37.8 parts per thousand to 3.2 parts per thousand and -261.5 parts per thousand to 34.5 parts per thousand, with a weighted mean -9.4 parts per thousand and -65.2 parts per thousand, respectively. A clear correlation exists between mean monthly delta O-18 values and mean monthly temperature, with R-2 = 0.68 for the mean monthly values increase of 0.91 parts per thousand per degree Celsius. A positive gradient of 0.32 parts per thousand/100 m was obtained from the Ili Valley when an annual weighted average of delta O-18 values was used. Considering the temporal and spatial variation of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and d-excess value of precipitation, combined with the results from the HYSPLIT4.0 air mass trajectory model, we found that moisture source in the study area is considered mainly replenished by the westerlies, and the moisture recycle from local surface water and soil water around Yining cannot be ignored. Although the data covers a year, it can still provide a good database for studying hydrological cycle in Centeral Asian.

AB This paper proposes a new finite volume multiscale finite element model (NFVMSFEM) for groundwater flow and velocity simulation in porous media. The main goal of this method is to simultaneously obtain the heads and continuous x, y direction Darcian velocities, thereby simplifying the simulation process and improving the efficiency. This goal is accomplished by introducing a novel velocity matrix in the control volume boundary flux estimation of the finite volume multiscale finite element method (FVMSFEM) framework. The velocity matrix allows for the NFVMSFEM to directly represent continuous fine-scale velocities by coarse-scale heads, thus merging the two kinds of unknowns into one. Through a modified Yeh's Galerkin model, the velocity matrix is constructed in each local coarse element before the head computation; thus, the computational cost is very little. Furthermore, the NFVMSFEM inherits the advantageous features of the FVMSFEM, which ensures the local conservation of heads and further improves the efficiency. The results of the comparison between the NFVMSFEM and certain classical methods for head and velocity computation demonstrate its effectiveness and high efficiency.

AB Climate change in mean-state or variability could lead to more/less frequency of extreme drought. In this study, we developed a new framework for decomposing the contributing factors of changes in future extreme drought frequency in China in accordance to the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). We performed a series of numerical experiments to ensure that the sensitivity of trend and variability in individual climatic variables can be distinguished. In addition, an extreme drought rate with warming (EDRW, unit: %.K-1) is defined to quantify the relative change in extreme drought frequency per Kelvin. Overall, the EDRW will increase dramatically by an average of 27.71%.K-1. The ascended EDRW are attributed to increases in temperature (+56.90%.K-1), net radiation (14.80%.K-1) and precipitation variability (+8.23%.K-1); a decrease in relative humidity (+4.61%K-1), but is partly offset by an increase in precipitation (i.e., "wetting", -60.12%.K-1). A smaller increase in the frequency of extreme droughts is found in high-latitude regions due to their enhanced sensitivity to "wetting".

AB Intensive potato production is an important contributor to groundwater and surface water nitrate contamination in the province of Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada. In PEI, the presence of a permeability contrast between soil and the underlying compact basal till at approximately 1 m depth is known to cause temporary perched water table conditions, but the implications for agricultural nitrate transport are not well understood. This study is the first detailed field investigation to examine the impact of the soil - compact basal till interface on vertical and lateral subsurface flow of water and solutes on a moderate hillslope in PEI. A surface-applied tracer test was conducted and a shallow drain-tile pipe system, with a tipping bucket gauge, was installed down-gradient of the tracer application to monitor lateral subsurface flow. In addition, three-dimensional electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) was employed to monitor the evolution of the applied tracer plume over a period of 1 year. A small scale, transient flow and transport model was used to simulate the tracer test and to investigate the sensitivity of tracer transport to selected parameters (primarily, the hydraulic conductivities of the soils and underlying compact basal till). Monitoring, conducted from October 2013 to June 2015, and numerical modeling showed a strong tendency for vertical flow of water and tracer through the soil - compact basal till interface as opposed to lateral down-slope subsurface flow. Water balance calculations estimated a total vertical flow of 94.5% of the infiltration for the October 2014 to January 2015 period. The preference for vertical over lateral flow and transport was consistent with electrical resistivity images for the same time period. These findings indicate that the fate of infiltrating water and dissolved nitrate is the deeper bedrock aquifer water table, and that intermittent perched water table conditions do not result in significant lateral flow toward nearby surface waters.

AB In this study, synchronized gridded precipitation and temperature generators were developed and evaluated in terms of their ability to reconstruct the spatial structure and other statistical properties of high-resolution CaPA (Canadian Precipitation Analysis) precipitation and GEM (Global Environmental Multiscale Model) temperature products. The precipitation generator is an extension to the gridded multi-site occurrence-amount model. While the multi-site framework is not efficiently applicable to regions with limited precipitation information and sparse observation network, this paper provides the full mathematical description of estimating the model based on high-resolution gridded products. The temperature model, on the other hand, introduces the first gridded hourly generator in the literature in which cyclic temperature components are conditioned using wet and dry day status information. This was achieved using harmonic functions establishing the connection between the simulated daily precipitation occurrence time-series and the moments of the generated temperature data. One of the key features of the proposed gridded generators is the capacity to produce temporally coherent fields of precipitation and temperature; an essential prerequisite for hydrologic modeling applications. The generators were evaluated in terms of their ability to reproduce the standard, interannual, and extreme-value characteristics of observed gridded products. The gridded precipitation model can preserve key statistical and spatial properties of the gridded CaPA observations to an acceptable level, while similar to the original multi-site framework, it falls short to capture long dry spells and the interannual variability of monthly total precipitation. The temperature model, on the other hand, preserves the majority of key features of the gridded GEM temperature observations, including the first two moments of the hourly data and the cumulative frequency of maximum and minimum temperature thresholds. The only notable defect identified is the departure of the interannual variability of the generated maximum and minimum temperatures from those observed.

   approach; Momentum transfer
ID OPEN-CHANNEL; RESISTANCE; MODELS
AB Determining the characteristics of pipe flow and the effect of friction resistance is relevant to a variety of applications in hydraulic and hydrological engineering such as flood control, river restoration and ground runoff prediction. In the Nikuradse's experiments, the relative roughness and the bulk Reynolds number are used to scale the Darcy friction factor thereby determining the mean velocity. Recent observations using permeable-walled pipes however indicate that the friction factor can significantly deviate from the results obtained in Nikuradse's approach. Here, we propose a concise model to estimate the mean velocity of the pipe flow over permeable walls. The model is formulated using a data-driven approach based on the analytical solution of the mean velocity and the similarity analysis (dimension conservation) of the two extreme cases: impermeable and porous pipe flow. We show that the proposed approach can derive a physically meaningful formula for the mean velocity. Furthermore, we propose a simple momentum transfer model which confirms the findings from the data-driven approach. The momentum transfer model indicates that the friction factor can be scaled with two different relative hydraulics radius scales, which are intrinsically determined by two different eddy sizes. Lastly, the present approach is examined by comparing it with another approximate formula and the limited experimental data in the literature.

AB Accurate forecasting of hourly suspended sediment concentration is a critical issue for reservoir management, especially during typhoon periods. This research proposes a two-stage forecasting approach integrating numerical and machine-learning-based models to provide accurate real-time forecasts of half-hourly suspended sediment concentration. In the first stage, the density current model, SRH2D, was verified and applied by the historical typhoon events due to the lack of measured suspended sediment concentration. Next, in the second stage, the calculated results from SRH2D based on the spatial-temporal relation were employed as the input of the MGSVM-based model. Finally, an application in the Shi-Men reservoir was conducted to demonstrate the forecasting performance of the proposed approach. The results indicated that the calculated data from the SRH2D model corresponded to the trend of measured data in spatial-temporal variation. Moreover, the proposed forecasting approach enables reasonably acceptable 0.5- to 3-h ahead forecasts of suspended sediment concentration by using the simulated data of half-hourly suspended sediment concentration. The accurate forecast conducted by the proposed approach is expected to be properly applied to reservoir management.

AB The discharge of fecal indicator bacteria into surface water sources poses treatment challenges to drinking water utilities. Changes in the discharge regimes of streams resulting from extreme precipitation associated with climate change can exacerbate these challenges. The catchments of many surface water sources depended upon by water treatment plants are ungauged, thus making it difficult to predict the impacts of climate change on the microbial quality of such water sources. In this study, a hydrological model is implemented to assess the impact of local climate projections on flow regimes and E. coli discharge in the ungauged catchment of the drinking water source for the city of Alesund in Norway. We performed separate sensitivity analysis for flow and E. colt, and assessed the variations in patterns of flow and E. coli concentrations in the streams in future using adjusted meteorological data. The calibrated flow showed good agreement with the observed data, but the E. coli model yielded lower performance indices. The results indicate that interception of precipitation by forest cover and soil organic carbon content mostly control flow generation in the catchments, and the variations in the concentrations of E. coli were more sensitive to instream sediment processes. Flow levels in the streams would remain the same in 2045 and 2075. Peak flows that currently occur in spring and autumn months may respectively shift back to winter and summer months. High concentrations of E. coli currently observed in summer in the streams may be lower in future, but the concentrations may be high at the start of autumn seasons. The results have management implications for watersheds and water utilities mostly in temperate climate regions.

AB Numerous studies have been conducted on Cs-137 transport in the environment in Fukushima, Japan, since the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident. Many studies have monitored river and stream water, and a declining trend in dissolved Cs-137 concentrations has been reported. In addition, temporary increases in dissolved Cs-137 concentrations have been observed during rainstorm events. However, the source and process of such temporary increases remain poorly understood. To address these gaps in knowledge, intense multi-point sampling and analysis of dissolved Cs-137 in stream water, soil water, and groundwater were conducted in a forested headwater catchment in Yamakiya district, located 35 km northwest of the FDNPP, from July 2015 to November 2016. The average dissolved Cs-137 concentration in stream water during baseflow conditions was 17 mBq/L, whereas the concentration during rainstorm events was 31 mBq/L (maximum: 170 mBq/L on July 15, 2015). The dissolved Cs-137 concentration in groundwater (average: 0.93 mBq/L) was lower than that in stream water. Conversely, high concentrations of dissolved Cs-137 in soil water were observed (average: 81 mBq/L), particularly at lower parts of the slope near the spring point and in wet conditions throughout summer. Consequently, the dissolved Cs-137 concentrations in stream water were considered to be derived mainly from soil water and diluted by groundwater. The high dissolved Cs-137 concentration in soil water may be derived from litter leachate in the shallow soil layer stored on the slope. During rainstorm events, the saturated area expands upward; therefore, the temporary increase in the dissolved Cs-137 concentration in stream water observed at the beginning of a rainstorm may be caused by the release of high levels of dissolved Cs-137 in soil water stored in the shallow soil layer.

AB Many studies have analyzed historical trends in annual peak flows in the United States because of the importance of flooding to bridges and other structures, and the concern that human influence may increase flooding. To help attribute causes of historical peak-flow changes, it is important to separate basins by characteristics that have different influences on peak flows. We analyzed historical trends by basin type: minimally altered basins, regulated basins (substantial reservoir storage but low urbanization), and urbanized basins (with low reservoir storage). Although many peak-flow magnitude changes were found in the last century across the conterminous United States, the trend magnitude and direction vary strongly by basin type and region. In general, there was a low percentage of significant increases and decreases for minimally altered basins while many regulated basins had significant decreases and the limited number of urbanized basins with long-term record showed a high percentage of increases. For urbanized basins, which are concentrated in the Northeast and Midwest, trend magnitude was significantly correlated with the amount of basin urbanization. For all basins regardless of type, parts of the Northeast quadrant of the U.S. had high concentrations of basins with large and significant increases while parts of the Southwest quadrant had high concentrations of basins with large and significant decreases. Basin regulation appears to have heavily influenced the decreasing trends in the Southwest quadrant; there were many large decreases for this basin type despite overall increases in heavy precipitation in this area. Changes over time in the number of 2-per-year and 1-per-5-year peaks over threshold are consistent with changes in the magnitude of annual peak flows.

ID WASTE-WATER SYSTEM; CLIMATE-CHANGE; QUALITY; CALIBRATION; RIVER
AB This paper proposes a new conceptual modelling approach and calibration method for sewer systems, driven by the interest in using the sewer as a bioreactor and long-term biochemical modelling of the integrated system consisting of the sewage collection system and the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The new approach consists of a method for simplifying a complex sewer network into a simpler, yet accurate, computationally efficient (conceptual) model able to capture the relevant sewer dynamics, both in terms of water quantity and water quality entering the wastewater treatment plant. Water quality predicted by the conceptual model was assessed using a detailed biochemical process model and compared against a whole-network biochemical model that covers all hydraulic segments and pipes of the sewer system. The conceptual biochemical model achieves very similar results as the whole-network model in terms of water quality, while providing much faster simulation speed (minutes rather than hours) and easy calibration. Given these advantages, the conceptual biochemical model of a collection system can be used in an integrated model with which sewer and WWTP can be simulated simultaneously for long-term evaluation of optimization scenarios. The model was applied to the prediction of the biochemical components, e.g. sulfide, organics and nutrients, which are essential for the control and management of sewer corrosion and pollutant removal.

AB To overcome water scarcity issues, Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) structures are currently developed in many parts of the world, including poorly permeable terrain like weathered crystalline rocks. In such geological context, characterized by relatively limited groundwater storage mainly associated with fractures located at the interface between the upper weathered layer (saprolite) and the fractured bedrock, the efficiency of MAR is poorly known. To address this question and better understand the factors that control recharge dynamics, an artificial recharge basin was implemented at the Experimental Hydrogeological Park in Telangana (South India), a well-equipped and continuously monitored site situated in Archean granitic terrain. The thickness of the saprolite and hydraulic properties are relatively well known all over the site from previous geophysical surveys and hydraulic tests.
   To characterize recharge dynamics, recharge has been monitored in different boreholes surrounding the infiltration basin. Infiltration rates and water level data are interpreted by both a volume balance approach and different analytical solutions. In addition, a simple numerical model was used to show how the depth of the permeable interface between saprolite and granite controls recharge dynamics and observed water levels variations. Results show that the permeability of the saprolite/bedrock interface is sufficiently large to allow an efficient recharge that propagates laterally throughout the aquifer through this well connected interface. However, the variable depth of this permeable pathway controls the water level response, acting as a semi-impervious boundary, leading to remarkable water level variations. Thus, our findings show how the characteristics of the most permeable pathways control recharge dynamics in weathered crystalline rocks. In addition, we show how the depth variations of the permeable interface between saprolite and granite may be inferred from the monitoring of water level during recharge events.

AB Streamflow forecasting has great significance in water resource management, particularly for reservoir operation. However, accurately predicting streamflow is challenging due to the non-stationary characteristics of hydrologic processes and the effects of noise. To improve monthly streamflow forecasting, this study proposes a data-driven model based on a double-processing strategy, which combines singular spectrum analysis (SSA), improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) and extreme learning machine (ELM) approaches. In the proposed double-processing model, called SSA-ICEEMDAN-ELM, the original streamflow series are first processed via SSA for denoising; then, the processed series are reprocessed via ICEEMDAN to decompose them into relatively stationary sub-series; finally, these sub-series are modelled using ELM. The performance of the proposed model is tested for one-month-ahead prediction using streamflow data from the Caojiahu and Shibalipu reservoirs in the Gulang River Basin. In addition, the proposed double-processing model is compared with four single-processing models, namely, empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-ELM, ensemble EMD (EEMD)-ELM, ICEEMDAN-ELM and SSA-ELM, and two single models without any processing, namely, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and ELM. The results show that: (a) the four single-processing models have higher prediction accuracy than the single models, and the performance of the SSA-ELM model is the best of these single-processing models, implying that noise in hydrological series cannot be ignored; (b) the proposed SSA-ICEEMDAN-ELM model is superior to the single-processing models and single models, demonstrating that the double-processing approach can further improve streamflow prediction accuracy. Thus, the proposed model, which is a promising method that is expected to benefit reservoir management, can better reduce the influence of noise and capture the dynamic characteristics of hydrological series.

AB Near-surface soil water content (NSWC) is an important parameter for characterizing hydrological processes, water and vapor exchange at the soil-atmosphere boundary, and potential biological productivity. Here we develop a dielectric based frequency-domain (FD) impedance sensor operating at 100 MHz, with a novel coaxial probe design and a temperature sensor embedded in the circuit board. This perforated cylinder coaxial (PCC) sensor provides simultaneous measurements of volumetric soil water content (VSWC) and of temperature. The temperature measurement allows signal correction for the temperature response of the circuit board and of the permittivity of soil water. We characterize the performance of the PCC sensor and compare it with alternative 3-pin- and 2-pin-electrode FD impedance sensors each using a similarly performing circuit board. A series of theoretical analyses and experiments were conducted, including (i) sensors calibration, (ii) temperature effects and their correction, (iii) soil volume sensed by each sensor through simulation analysis and a stepwise soil removal (SSR) test and (iv) accuracy comparison of the three sensors when applied for the NSWC measurements. The calibration results verified that the PCC, 3-pin and 2-pin probes were suitable to measure VSWC (RMSE <= 0.0142 cm(3) cm(-3)). The simulation analysis using High Frequency Structure Simulator software (HFSS) indicated that the novel PCC probe had a symmetrical distribution of the E-field, wholly contained within the cylinder, avoiding leakage of the E-Field into air at the soil-atmosphere interface and removing the dependency of sensed volume on VSWC. The results of the SSR test showed that the E-field distributed outside the receiving electrode of the PCC probe could be ignored whereas that of both pin-type electrodes was distributed outside of the receiving electrode to a distance that depended on VSWC (i.e. up to 8 mm for 3-pin and up to 11 mm for 2-pin designs when VSWC > 0.17 cm(3) cm(-3)), which corresponds to the simulation analysis. Moreover, the new PCC probe provided more accurate NSWC measurement than 3-pin or 2-pin probes because the E-field was contained within the perforated cylinder, avoiding E-field leakage and fixing sensed soil volume independent of VSWC. The pin-structure probes appear to perform best when installed horizontally in the soil at least 11 mm below the surface.

AB Transport and fate of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in rivers arc important aspects of the carbon cycle and the critical linkage between terrestrial, aquatic, and marine systems. Recent studies have quantified fluvial export to the marine environment in many systems, but in-stream losses of DOC are poorly constrained. This study compares DOC yields (kg C/ha) between the area-weighted averages of several tributaries within larger watersheds with the DOC yields of the larger watersheds to gain insight on in-stream losses in larger river systems. Four large watersheds, 22 tributaries to those watersheds, and 5 additional main stem locations in Maine were studied during 1 April to 15 November in 2011 through 2013. There were no significant differences in the area weighted average DOC yield of the tributaries and the larger watersheds indicating little net in-stream loss in the main stems of the larger rivers. It is unlikely that inputs of DOC from un-gauged areas compensated for losses from gauged tributaries based on similarity in DOC yield longitudinally along the main stems of two of the rivers. In addition, wetland abundance, which is associated with higher DOC yield in this environment, did not consistently increase from tributaries to the larger watershed or longitudinally along the main stems. This geographic distribution of wetlands therefore also indicates that it is unlikely that inputs of DOC from un-gauged areas compensated for losses from gauged tributaries. These findings suggest that in-stream losses of DOC in these larger river systems are minimal and that the vast majority of DOC in major rivers in Maine is transported conservatively to the coastal ocean.

AB Monitoring continental precipitation over Europe with high resolution (2 km, 15 min) has been possible since the operational production of the OPERA composites from the European weather radar networks. The OPERA data are the essential input to a hazard assessment tool for identifying localized rainfall-induced flash floods at European scale, and their quality determines the performance of the tool. This paper analyses the OPERA data quality during the warm seasons of 2015-2017 by comparing the estimated rainfall accumulations with the SYNOP rain gauge records over Europe. To compensate the OPERA underestimation, a simple spatially-variable bias adjustment method has been applied. The long-term comparison between the OPERA and gauge point daily rainfall accumulations at the gauge locations shows the benefit of the bias adjustment. Additionally, the daily monitoring shows gradual improvement of the OPERA data year by year. The impact of the quality of the OPERA data for effective flash flood identification is demonstrated for the case of the flash floods that occurred from 29 May to 3 June 2016 in central Europe.

AB In urban stormwater pipe networks, pipe leakage may lead to reduction of groundwater recharge, to significant reduction of groundwater levels, and to subsurface contamination. In the present study, stormwater pipe leakage is simulated in a case study representing an urban catchment using the coupled groundwater-pipe network flow model OGS-HE. This model includes pipe flow, variably saturated subsurface flow and exchange fluxes to and from leaky pipes. The study area is a typical northern German urban catchment with a stormwater pipe network which is located partly below and above groundwater. The successful calibration of a groundwater model is shown. Based on the calibrated groundwater model, stormwater pipe leakage for pipe networks of different ages and different pipe defect sizes is investigated for dry-weather flow conditions and rainfall conditions. It is shown that standard defects with a size of 10(-4) m(2) per m pipe can result in a groundwater infiltration into the leaky pipe network, which is in the order of annual groundwater recharge. The same standard defect size leads to a reduction of local groundwater levels by several meters. Rain events of increasing return period reduce groundwater infiltration into leaky pipes and increase stormwater exfiltration from leaky pipes, while the temporal distribution of a rain event has no effect on stormwater leakage.

AB To reflect a key aspect of global socio-hydrology, this paper explores global virtual water use from source of exploitation to sink of final consumption via interregional trades within the world economy as reflected by world input-output database for 2014. An embodiment accounting model is developed, which takes full account of virtual water feedbacks related to primary inputs. Global total trade volume of virtual water is estimated to be in magnitude around 30% of the global direct freshwater withdrawal. Moreover, it is revealed that global virtual water transfer in intermediate trade is in magnitude around 1.4 times that in final trade. In intermediate trade of virtual water, China, Japan and the United Kingdom turn out to be the three leading net importers, while India, Russia and the United States are revealed as the leading net exporters. In final trade of virtual water, the United States, Japan and Russia are the major net importers, in contrast to China, India and Mexico as the leading net exporters. Trade connections and imbalances of major economies in terms of virtual water are quantified and analyzed. Two new indicators in terms of water self-sufficiency rate by source and that by sink are devised. It is found that around 40% of the use of China's freshwater withdrawal finally sinks into foreign economies while only 20% of China's virtual water use originates from other regions. With regard to Germany, Canada and France, they behave like active pumps driving vast virtual water inflows and outflows, demonstrating their high involvement in the global supply chain in terms of virtual water. With the increasingly frequent virtual water transfer within the world economy, nations and regions ought to assess their behaviors in intermediate and final trades of virtual water for sustainable use of freshwater resources.

AB Runoff generation from rainfall events is a complex, spatial and temporally dependent process strongly governed, among other factors, by catchment surface topography. Although it is widely known that many catchments experience morphological evolution, it is often ignored in analysis for different reasons ranging from simplification to lack of data. However, young catchments and early landscapes (such as those which are affected by natural or anthropogenic disturbances) do exhibit topography changes which in turn affect catchment hydrodynamics, hydrology and in particular runoff. In this work, we study the runoff generation and hydrodynamics of the Huhnerwasser artificial catchment (Brandenburg, Germany) during a period of erosion-based topographical changes (2006-2010). Nine Digital Elevation Models from such period were used as topography over which physically-based simulations were performed. The results suggest that topographic evolution in this catchment mostly affects the onset of runoff, whereas peak discharges and receding hydrograph limbs are less affected. These differences in hydrological signatures can be explained through the changes in the spatial distribution of runoff hydrodynamics and their impact on surface runoff connectivity. Relatively small topographical differences produce changing ponding conditions and modify flowpaths which becomes evident only through inspection of the spatial distribution of hydrodynamic variables. Moreover, the study shows that in order for simulations to be able to capture such responses, appropriate computational mesh and topographical data resolution are critical, since connectivity itself can be greatly affected by low resolution data or representation.

TI Comparing three approaches to reconstructing streamflow using tree rings

AB Tree-ring reconstructions of streamflow can provide long-term perspectives of flow variability that may be useful in management strategies for water resources. Relative to other portions of the United States, there is a dearth of tree-ring based streamflow reconstructions in the Midwest. The Wabash River is an important water resource in Indiana and Illinois where many sectors rely on it. Here, to better understand the historic hydroclimate within the Wabash River Basin, we reconstructed June-September streamflow for a tributary of the Wabash River using three statistical approaches: the traditional basin approach, and the recently-developed climate-footprint, and drought-reconstruction approaches. Our reconstructions explained 53-71% of the variance for the common period (1941-1984). We find that in our three reconstructions, there are extreme droughts and pluvials that exceed those during the instrumental period, including a sustained five-decade low-flow event in the early 19th century. Overall, we find that the traditional basin approach produced the most robust model but had the shortest reconstruction length of the three approaches, as it requires the predictor chronologies to be derived from within the basin. Our results indicate that there are merits and drawbacks to each approach with the general pattern of sacrificing variance explained for reconstruction length.

AB The quantitative estimation of the quick-flow runoff component of streamflow is required for many hydrologic applications. Estimation at the monthly timescale and national spatial scale would be particularly useful for national water availability modeling. This paper reviews a sample of commonly used equations for quick-flow runoff, including several currently in use in continental-scale models. The review shows the wide range of equation forms or heuristics currently in use to predict quick-flow runoff, the limited spatial scale over which these equations are often developed or calibrated, and the scarcity of well-tested equations available for quick flow runoff at the monthly timescale. Data were gathered from a set of 1301 gaged watersheds across the United States to test a range of equations from the literature, along with several alternative equations, to assess and compare their performance in predicting quick-flow runoff at the monthly timescale. The highest-performing equation was selected for application to monthly maps of explanatory variables to produce monthly quick-flow runoff water budget contribution maps. This equation is a regression against precipitation, soil saturated hydraulic conductivity, surficial geology type, and slope data. Its application indicates that average quick-flow runoff across the conterminous United States in the winter exceeds that in the summer by up to a factor of three. The monthly maps were explored and evaluated for the timespan of 2000-2015. The comparison of equation forms and produced monthly maps will be useful for a variety of hydrologic modeling and monitoring applications.

AB Streamflow data is important for studies of water resources and flood management, but an inherent problem is that many catchments of interest are ungauged. The lack of data is particularly the case for small catchments, where flow data with high temporal resolution is needed. This paper presents an analysis of regionalizing parameters of the Distance Distribution Dynamics (DDD) rainfall-runoff model for predicting hourly flows at small-ungauged rural catchments. The performance of the model with hourly time resolution has been evaluated (calibrated and validated) for 41 small gauged catchments in Norway (areas from 1 km(2)-50 km(2)). The model parameters needing regionalization have been regionalized using three different methods: multiple regression, physical similarity (single-donor and pooling-group based methods), and a combination of the two methods. Seven independent catchments, which are not used in the evaluation, are used for validation of the regionalization methods. All the three methods (the multiple regression, pooling-group, and combined methods) perform satisfactorily (0.5 <= KGE < 0.75). The combined method (which combines multiple regression and pooling-group) performed slightly better than the other methods. Some model parameters, namely those describing recession characteristics, estimated by the regionalization methods, appear to be a better choice than those estimated locally from short period of hydro-meteorological data for some test catchments. The single donor method did not perform satisfactorily. The satisfactory performance of the combined method shows that regionalization of DDD model parameters is possible by combining multiple regression and physical similarity methods.

AB Understanding how the moisture content in a green roof substrate varies during a storm event is essential for accurately modelling runoff detention. In this paper, a green roof test bed installed with moisture probes at three depths was used to understand how moisture content varies during storms. Detailed studies were conducted on five selected storm events. Physical characterisation tests and field-data based calibrations were performed to acquire the model parameters. Two alternative detention models, based on Reservoir Routing and Richard's Equation, were validated against the measured green roof runoff and temporary moisture storage data. Once the moisture content exceeds local field capacity, its response at different depths occurs simultaneously during storms, although the recorded data indicate a vertical gradient in the absolute values of local field capacity. Both Reservoir Routing and Richard's Equation can provide reasonable estimations of the runoff and the vertical moisture content profiles, although Richard's Equation exhibited stronger vertical water content gradients than were observed in practise. The vertical water content profile is not sensitive to the soil water release curve, although the hydraulic conductivity function influences both the vertical water content profile and runoff rate. The modelled results are highly sensitive to the bottom boundary condition, with a constant suction head boundary condition providing a more suitable option than a free drainage boundary condition or a seepage boundary condition.

AB Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been extensively investigated as a potential engineering measure to reduce anthropogenic carbon emission to the atmosphere. Real-time monitoring of the safety and integrity of carbon storage reservoirs is a critical aspect of any commercial-scale CCS deployment. Pressure-based sensing is cost effective, suitable for real-time monitoring, and scalable to large monitoring networks. However, questions remain on how to best harness intelligent information from the high-frequency pressure monitoring sensors to support real-time decisions. This work presents a deep-learning-based framework for analyzing and detecting anomalies in pressure data streams by using a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) neural network model, which allows for the fusion of both static and dynamic reservoir data. In ConvLSTM, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for spatial pattern mining and the LSTM is used for temporal pattern recognition. The performance of the ConvLSTM model for real-time anomaly detection is demonstrated using a set of pressure monitoring data collected from Cranfield, Mississippi, an active enhanced-oil-recovery field. The anomaly detection model is trained using bottom-hole pressure data acquired from the base experiment (without leak event) and then tested on pressure data collected during a series of controlled CO2 release experiments (with artificially created leak events). Results show that the ConvLSTM neural network model successfully detected anomalies in the pressure time series obtained from the controlled release experiments. Inclusion of static information into the model further improves the robustness of ConvLSTM.

AB The forecasting accuracy of downstream water levels greatly impacts the economic operation of reregulating hydropower stations. If present, large errors in water level forecasting may require the hydropower station to discard water, which decreases the revenue from hydropower generation. Especially when the reregulating hydropower station undertakes the task of peak load regulation of the power grid, its power output may change drastically over a short period of time. Such large changes in the discharged flow of the hydropower station may inevitably cause an unsteady flow, which can lead to large fluctuations in the water levels of downstream rivers. In this case, the current forecasting methods, such as standard rating curves and empirical formulae, may inevitably result in large deviations when forecasting the change in the downstream water level. In order to reduce the volume of water discarded as a result of forecasting errors, a back propagation neural network-based forecasting model for downstream water levels of a reregulating hydropower station was constructed. The model enabled the direct, accurate, real-time forecasting of changes in downstream water levels by using measurable operation data from a hydropower station and process data on downstream water level changes. This method was applied to the actual hydropower generation dispatch of the Gezhouba Hydropower Plant in China. The results showed that as the peak load regulation volume increased, the forecasting errors of two conventional methods (standard rating curves and empirical formulae) became continuously superimposed. However, the water level forecasting error of the neural network-based method was small and could fully meet the real-time dispatching requirements of the hydropower station. In particular, under large peak load regulations, the maximum absolute values of the forecasting errors of the two conventional methods were close to 1 m, while that of the neural network-based method could be controlled within 0.3 m.

ID GREYWATER REUSE
AB Population growth and climate change place a strain on water resources; hence, there are growing initiatives to reduce household water use. UKWIR (2016) have a stated aim to halve water abstraction by 2050. This will significantly reduce inflow to sewer systems and increase wastewater concentration. This work presents a new stochastic sewer model that can be used to predict both hydraulic and pollutant loading for various water saving scenarios. The stochastic sewer model is based on integration of the stochastic water demand model SIMDEUM (R) with the InfoWorks ICM (R) (Sewer Edition) hydraulic model and software. This model has been developed using foul sewer networks, i.e. where household discharges are the dominant inflow; however, it could also be used in combined sewage systems where rainwater flows would add to the stochastic dry weather flow (DWF). The stochastic sewer model was tested and validated on several real catchments in the Wessex Water area of the UK. Calibration was carried out using metered consumption data. The stochastic sewer model gives an accurate prediction of the diurnal patterns of sewage discharge at a household level and was validated using real flow measurements within the catchment. The results obtained indicate that this model can be used to accurately predict changes in flow due to water conservation. A preliminary study for the impact of low water use on this validated network model has been conducted and it was found that overnight and daytime flow was reduced by up to 80% whereas evening flows remained largely similar. Extended stagnation times were observed in the street scale pipes (150 mm) in the low water use scenario.

AB Parameters are usually assumed to be stationary, and regarded as constants in hydrological modelling. However, studies have shown that model parameters may vary temporally due to human activities, and climate variability and changes. This study proposes a framework for quantifying hydrological model parameters as functions of time-variant catchment properties, aiming to improve the capability of capturing hydrograph and the extra-polative ability of hydrological models under a changing environment. The framework includes four steps: (1) estimating model parameters by using an ensemble Kalman filter based on the observations; (2) analyzing correlations between estimated parameter values and catchment properties; (3) constructing a set of parameter functions based on the identified catchment properties and the proposed functional forms; and (4) selecting and testing the best-performed model. As a demonstration of the framework, the monthly water balance for Tongtianhe and Ganjiang basins in China with different climate are simulated using a two-parameter monthly water balance model. Results from the Tongtianhe Basin show that considering the time-variant evapotranspiration parameter (C) brings improvement in low flows when water storage capacity (SC) is treated as constant since there is no significant improvement in runoff simulation when SC is treated as a time-variant parameter. The application to Ganjiang Basin shows that reasonable improvements are achieved when both C and SC are treated as time-variant, especially in low and high flows. The presented framework provides a useful tool for estimating time-variant parameters of hydrological models, thereby leading to more reliable model predictions under a changing environment.

AB The objective of this paper was to evaluate a recently proposed comprehensive model for three-dimensional single-ring infiltration and its suitability for estimating soil hydraulic properties. Infiltration data from four different soils with contrasting characteristics were inverted to estimate field-saturated soil hydraulic conductivity, K-fs, values using a total of fourteen different scenarios. Those scenarios differed by: i) the way they constrained the macroscopic capillary length, lambda, and the initial and saturated soil water contents, theta(i) and theta(s), ii) the use of transient or steady-state data, and iii) the fitting methods applied to transient data. For comparative purposes, the SSBI method (Steady version of the Simplified method based on a Beerkan Infiltration run) was also applied. For validation purposes K-fs data estimated from the different scenarios were compared with those values obtained by numerical inverse modeling with HYDRUS-2D/3D. This comparison identified Approaches 1 and 3, which respectively estimate K-fs via optimization and using analytical expressions, as the most accurate methods. The steady-state scenario of Approach 4 and the SSBI method, both of which use a lambda value of first approximation, appeared preferable for field campaigns aimed to sample remote or large areas, given that they do not need additional data and still provide acceptable estimates. The reliability of K-fs data was also checked through a comparison with unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, K-h, values measured in laboratory on extracted soil cores, in order to discriminate between theoretically possible (K-fs > K-h) and impossible (K-fs <= K-h) situations. Physically possible K-fs values were always obtained with the exception of the crusted soil, where K-fs < K-h situations suggested that the crust layer reduced water flow during ponding experiments in the field. The new comprehensive model tested in this study represents a valuable tool for analyzing both transient and steady-state infiltration data, as well as experiments carried out with different depths of ponded water, ring sizes and ring insertion depths.

AB Accurate spatiotemporal analysis of surface water is important for managing water resources. The main objectives of this study were: 1) to assess different remote sensing algorithms' ability to accurately determine flood extent using MODIS imagery, and 2) to study the temporal dynamics of inundated areas and corresponding return periods in a large catchment in New South Wales, Australia.
   The different water detection alternatives used included the Open Water Likelihood (OWL) algorithm, the Brakenridge algorithm for single images (BRAK) and composite images (BRAKC), the Islam methodology (ISL), a combination of Normalized Difference Indices (NDIS), and an ensemble of these. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images were used as a reference to benchmark the performance of the algorithms. Occurrence probability maps derived from inundation images and estimated flood extent frequency curves were compared against the Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset of the Joint Research Centre.
   The ISL methodology indicated the best performance compared with "ground truth" inundated images derived from Landsat, while the temporal performance of the BRAK algorithm indicated significant noise based on daily imagery. The remaining approaches generally matched stream discharge peaks. Maximum cross-correlation coefficients between daily discharge and inundated areas were calculated for different time lags, indicating high spatial variability across the catchment. Accumulated rainfall accounted for up to 40 and 60% of the variation in inundation extent in daily and composite images, respectively. The ensemble technique outperformed the other algorithms to describe the dynamics of flooding, followed by the NDIS and ISL algorithms. The occurrence probability images and flood frequency curves indicated a higher inundation extent than the GSW product for return periods greater than two years, which can be explained by the different temporal resolutions. The results of this study can be applied in water resources planning and flood mitigation efforts.

ID REGIONAL LAND SUBSIDENCE; MATHEMATICAL-MODEL
AB Ground surface subsidence due to groundwater production is a significant problem. Many attempts have been made to develop analytical models to forecast subsidence rates as a consequence of groundwater production. Previous analytical solutions either make limiting assumptions about the stress regime (e.g., radially symmetric with uniaxial strain or radially symmetric with zero incremental vertical total stress) or assume that the pressure distribution within the aquifer is uniform. Imposing assumptions about the stress regime lead to an overestimate of subsidence. Imposing a uniform pressure assumption often leads to an underestimate of subsidence. In this article, the principle of superposition is applied to extend a previous analytical solution, for a cylindrical uniform pressure change, to allow for a non-uniform pressure distribution resulting from constant rate production of a viscous fluid from a cylindrical confined aquifer of finite permeability. Results from the analytical solution are verified by comparison with a set of fully coupled hydro-mechanical finite element simulations. The analytical solution for subsidence directly above the production well (or uplift above an injection well) can be written in closed-form and is straightforward to evaluate. The equation also shows that, for many practical purposes, ground surface subsidence is insensitive to production fluid viscosity and aquifer permeability when the aquifer radius is less than the aquifer depth below the ground surface.

AB Climate change and increasing urbanization pose huge challenges in managing urban planning for a sustainable future. Intense urbanization resulting in the so-called mega cites aggravates floods by increasing the amount of impermeable surfaces and modifying flow routes. Statistics show that flood disasters are one of the most significant in terms of damages and losses. Urbanization rates are increasing rapidly and it is important to learn how to live with floods by alleviating their consequences, in the present and future. This concern points to the resilience concept. By including the concept of resilience in flood risk analysis and decision-making, urban drainage design moves towards sustainable drainage systems. This study discusses resilience in the flood risk contextWe considered three main drivers to define a quantitative measure of flood resilience: the capability of a drainage system to resist and provide its service continuously over time; the capability of an urban area to recover from flood losses; and the capability of urban systems to evacuate floodwaters and return to a functional state. Consequently, this paper describes how flood resilience can be modeled and spatialized by a multi-criteria index called Spatialized Urban Flood Resilience Index (S-FRESI). The S-FRESI composition (according to the resilience definition adopted) combines: the hazard characteristics and the system exposure and susceptibility, to represent flood resistance mapped over time; the ability for material recovery from losses caused by inundation, considering the income variable; and the functional capacity of the drainage system, represented by the flood duration. S-FRESI can be used to measure and visualize the changes in flood resilience attained by different flood control measures, as well as in future scenarios of population growth, uncontrolled urbanization or climate change. The index was tested with coherent and consistent results in the Dona Eugenia river catchment in Rio de Janeiro. Four different scenarios were formulated: (1) the current situation; (2) the current situation considering the implementation of sustainable flood control measures; (3) a future situation with the same infrastructure as today; and (4) a future situation with the considered flood control measures.

TI Integrated modelling of a megacity water system - The application of a
   transdisciplinary approach to the Lima metropolitan area
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DE Cross-impact-balance; Lima; Macro-modelling; Scenario development;
   Simulation; Water supply
AB The rapidly growing urban centres throughout the world are facing serious problems due to the fast changing developments in all of their environmental spheres (nature, society, politics, culture and economics). Therefore, strategic planning becomes even more important in order to develop strategies that allow cities to adapt to new challenges and to prevent or to mitigate negative trends. This paper presents a transdisciplinary approach to water management, which combines adaptation and application of methods from hydrology, social sciences, water engineering and modelling; furthermore, this approach also involves stakeholders in this process. This methodology assists cities in addressing risks by elaborating solutions, which are characterised by ownership and acceptance of the stakeholders involved. The presented methodology proposed here has been applied to the water system of the desert megacity of Lima/Peru. As a city of almost 10 million inhabitants and with an annual rainfall of about 10 mm per year, Lima presents a unique case with particular challenges regarding water supply. In order to assess the changes in precipitation and temperature for the next decades, two global circulation models and three scenarios have been used. Changes in discharge was addressed using the conceptual rainfall-runoff model HBV applied in both the Atlantic and Pacific catchments relevant to the capital city Lima in terms of water supply. A scenario methodology, combining qualitative and quantitative elements, based on the Cross Impact Balance Analysis, has been developed and applied. From the millions of theoretically possible combinations of future developments of "descriptors" (driving forces) of the water system, four have been identified as the (only) consistent potential developments of the future. Local stakeholders, stemming from a wide range of institutions have been actively involved in the definition of these driving forces and the set of scenarios. The evaluation of these scenarios and potential options to adapt the water system to future developments was carried out by modelling and simulation, using a purpose-built, yet general, simulator which represents the entire water and wastewater system and includes the important inherent feedback loops (e.g. water demand by irrigation, reuse of treated and untreated wastewaters). The setup of the simulator and the implemented models was done in a way that the simulator formed an integral element in the design of strategies and measures, derived by this innovative combination of qualitative scenario building, quantitative modelling and stakeholder participation. As a core result of this process, the Action Plan "Lima 2040" has been developed and adopted, in which the signatories (the main institutions and organisations responsible for the water sector of Lima) commit themselves to specific actions to be implemented over the years to come.

AB Access to safe drinking water is now recognized as a human right and a government priority at an international level. In modern megacities, where urban agglomerations progressively encroach on the fringes between cities and rural areas, a growing trend in developing countries, water access is an urgent concern. Like most of the world's megacities, the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region is marked by a dependence on water sources outside its borders. This paper describes and discusses the unequal distribution of water supply and sanitation (WSS) services in this metropolitan area from a historical path-dependence perspective. Drawing upon the theoretical concept of the socio-technical system, it explores diachronically past, present, and future scenarios of WSS in the area. The conclusions stress the existence of socio-technical path-dependency and raise questions for future researches. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With an ever-growing population of around 10 million inhabitants (officially 7.9 in 2013), Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is set to become one of the largest cities in South East Asia and already occupies a major economic role in the area. To accommodate the increasing population, the megacity now stretches out in an urban continuum covering more than 800 square kilometers and is currently growing at a rate of 3.2% per year. If the neighboring provinces around HCMC are included, the total population reaches nearly 18 million people.
   This paper attempts to describe the interplay between HCMC and flood-related risks and offer some guidelines to deal with inundations. The potential risks of flooding by rain, tsunami and/or dam failure upstream of the city are evaluated and contextualized within the perspective of climate and human induced environmental changes. The region is highly vulnerable to the combined effects of subsidence and rising sea levels and has already led to serious flooding that may extend spatially before the end of the century. We propose possible preventative solutions to urban flooding using a multi-pronged approach to issues regarding urban development and suggest a redevelopment strategy for major infrastructure projects.

AB Megacities are facing a twofold challenge regarding resources: (i) ensure their availability for a growing urban population and (ii) limit the impact of resource losses to the environment. This paper focuses on two essential resources - nitrogen and phosphorus - and challenges their sustainable management in the water-agro-food system of Paris Megacity. An in-depth analysis of the nitrogen and phosphorus imprint of Paris Megacity was conducted, originally centered on human metabolism through consumption and excretion of these two elements. Upstream, the whole agricultural production that feeds Paris Megacity was scrutinized and nitrogen and phosphorus flows in the agro-system were fully documented. Downstream, the analysis of solid waste and wastewater management in Paris Megacity showed the fate of nitrogen and phosphorus imported into the city.
   Paris Megacity appears to rely on a very complex and international agro-food system, requiring high levels of chemical fertilizers and strongly impacting the environment through nutrient environmental losses. On the other hand, solid waste and wastewater management appears to be mostly disconnected from the agro-food system: even if the release of nitrogen and phosphorus into the environment has largely decreased in recent years, their recycling rate remains very low. This overview of the water-agro-food system of Paris Megacity suggests that an optimal management of nitrogen and phosphorus in the three subsystems (agriculture, waste management and sanitation) should be integrated within a comprehensive approach linking agriculture and urban residues. This analysis thus constitutes a groundwork on which paradigm shift scenarios of the global water-agro-food system could be constructed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   context: The case study of Jakarta
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Groundwater dependency; Water supply; Coupled surface-groundwater
   modelling; Jakarta
AB An overview of the urban shallow groundwater dynamics in Jakarta is provided. The modifications to the water budget at the micro and mesoscale due to anthropogenic influences are described and the diffusive nature of the interaction analysed. The scale of urbanisation (>10 million residents) in conjunction with the lack of infrastructure for water-related services is seen to have fostered a dependency on the shallow groundwater resources and, in turn, led to a tangible impact on the groundwater domain, which is difficult to quantify and study. Using short duration yet high temporal resolution groundwater level data collected at an urban site within Jakarta, two metrics are developed that can describe the daily variation in groundwater levels driven by the human interaction. Numerical models of varying complexity for the urban shallow groundwater dynamics are then used. Here, by employing a process of gradually improving the model's physical description while performing parameter estimation based on the new metrics, the study provides evidence of the role of the unsaturated zone in influencing the urban shallow groundwater dynamics. We further identify Jakarta's wastewater seepage as the crucial yet overlooked component of the urban cycle, having direct implications for the region's water security. The innovation of this study lies at the combination of high temporal resolution data with flexible modelling frameworks that can be developed to give insights into rapidly growing, unstructured stressors on water resources in data poor Mega Cities from the developing world.

DE Water in mega-cities; Modular-tray green roof systems; Hydrological
   performance of green roofs; CN (Curve Number); C (Coefficient of Runoff)
AB This paper investigates the performance of modular-tray green roof systems on rainwater retention and total runoff delay under heavy rain conditions, typical of countries with a tropical climate. It involved the building of a rain-spray system simulator and worktops to support the experimental units. Three green roof modular-tray systems were studied, M-4L, M-17L and F-17L, with a mix of succulent plant species. The volume and delay of total runoff were sampled for both dry and wet soil-moisture stages for a simulated rainstorm of 155 mm/h and duration of 7 min, which approaches the value of the design rainfall of 10-year return-period and an observed rainfall event that caused flooding in 2011 in the area where the experiments took place. These results were compared to three bare-soil similar experimental units and with a control unit consisting of a corrugated fibre-cement roof sheet. In addition, classic rainfall runoff parameterization, also important for catchment analysis, such as the rational coefficient method (C) and Curve Number (CN) were also applied. The results showed to be consistent. Overall, module F-17L presented the best performance with regard to both water retention and delay of total runoff. The average percentage of retention, considering all module types, was 58% of the total induced water volume, and the average delay for total runoff was approximately 12 min. In some tests, for the wet soil stage, the bare soil units performed better than the vegetated units. Soil moisture analysis revealed that considering the same period of time, the bare soil units lost more water through evaporation than the vegetated units through evapotranspiration. The average values of C for vegetated units for the wet and dry soil stages were equal to 0.66 and 0.27, respectively. The CN values were high, ranging from 88 to 97. Although fairly new on the market in Rio de Janeiro, modular-tray green roof systems are easy to build and hydrologically effective, mainly in the dry soil stages, performing as well as other extensive green roof systems. The values obtained for C and CN may be useful for the modelling of catchment rainfall and runoff especially for scenarios involving green roofs, as well as for establishing regulatory benchmarks towards more resilient and sustainable cities.

AB Due to rapid urbanization, population growth and economic drivers, megacities and metropolises around the world face increasing water challenges, such as water scarcity, degradation of water resources and water-related risks such as flooding. Climate change is expected to put additional stress on already strained metropolitan water management systems. Although there is considerable research on river basin management and on urban water management, there is hardly any on metropolitan water management. Similarly, as urban water generally emerges from and returns to river basins, it is surprising how little literature there is that explicitly connects these two spheres of governance. Hence this review paper addresses the: What does a review of the literature tell us about the overlap and reconciliation between the concepts of Integrated Water Resources/River Basin Management and Metropolitan/Urban Water Management, particularly in relation to megacities? Based on an extensive literature review, this paper concludes that the key differences between the two are in relation to their overarching framework, scope, inputs and outputs of water and in relation to dealing with extreme weather events. The literature review reveals how sustainable and integrated urban water management increasingly adopt principles and rhetoric from integrated water resource management, this has yet to translate into significant changing practices on the ground. Urban water management still often occurs independently of river basin issues. Achieving coherence between river basin management and sustainable/integrated urban water management is even more difficult in metropolises and megacities, because the latter consists of multiple political-administrative units. The article concludes that the scalar mismatch between river basin management and metropolitan/megacity water governance deserves much greater attention than it currently receives in the academic and policy debates.

TI Cities as hotspots of indirect water consumption: The case study of Hong

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

   RESOURCES; CHINA; SUSTAINABILITY; INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT; ENERGY
AB During the last years, the city of Hong Kong has made large investments to make its urban water supply system more water efficient and sustainable. As such, its municipal water abstraction - often defined as direct water use - has decreased from 355 litre per capita per day (l/cap/d) in 2005 to 326 l/cap/d in 2013. Due to its political history, Hong Kong is unique in the world in data availability on urban food consumption. It is therefore the ideal case study to show typical urban food consumption behaviour and its related indirect water use. The objective of this paper is to show the large water quantities associated with indirect water use and that the citizens of Hong Kong can additionally save much more water by looking at this indirect water use. The current average diet in Hong Kong is very different to the average Chinese diet. It is characterised by a high intake of water intensive products like animal products and sugar, leading to a food related indirect water use or water footprint (WFcons) of 4727 l/cap/d. According to recommendations from the Chinese Nutrition Society for a healthy diet, the intake of some product groups should be increased (vegetables and fruit) and of other product groups reduced (sugar, crop oils, meat and animal fats). This would result in a reduction of the WFcons of 40% to 2852 l/cap/d. Especially the reduced intake of meat (including offals) from currently 126 kg per capita per year (kg/cap/yr) to the recommended value 27 kg/cap/yr would results in a substantial WFcons reduction. Meat consumption in Hong Kong is extremely high. A pesco-vegetarian diet would result in a reduction of 49% (to 2398 l/cap/d) and a vegetarian diet in a 53% (to 2224 l/cap/d) reduction. Hong Kong citizens can thus save a lot of water through a change in their diet. Many of the products consumed, contribute to different levels of blue water scarcity in the regions of origin Hong Kong imports from. This poses a water-related risk to food security in Hong Kong. As all diet scenarios also result in a lower blue WFcons, they decrease this risk. In order to become sustainable, (mega)cities should reduce their dependency on distant resources and ecosystems.

AB Ageing water infrastructure and population growth, issues that are characteristic of megacities, are likely to exacerbate water supply deficits in London. To address this threat, wastewater reclamation and non potable reuse can potentially close the supply-demand gap without impacting on environmental water bodies. There is a need to understand the types of challenges that diverse stakeholders face in relation to the governance of NPR schemes, and how those challenges might be addressed in a megacity context. A case study is used to explore these challenges for an operational sewer mining scheme in London, where reclaimed non-potable water is used for irrigation and toilet flushing at the site of the London 2012 Olympic Park. Through qualitative analysis of interview and document data, the results highlight that collaboration and learning opportunities are perceived as necessary to improve scheme governance. The findings indicate that formal and informal engagement activities centred on risk management can support the development of common understandings, build important inter-stakeholder relationships and help maintain trust. Non-potable reuse can contribute to the resilience of megacities through infrastructure diversification, but its feasibility will depend on the willingness of stakeholders to participate and continually negotiate new risk management practices.

ID COPRODUCTION
AB With an estimated 10.6 million inhabitants in 2015 and an average 6.6% annual growth rate, Kinshasa ranks among the three largest cities in Africa and may well become the most populated. To cope with critically deficient water services, a local NGO supported by different donors has promoted decentralized water systems (DWS) that have spread in the city outskirts, based on a model with original features compared to other African experiences. Here, we intend to provide an empirically grounded and analytically sound inquiry into the relevance, efficiency and sustainability of these DWSs in the context of the megacity of Kinshasa. First, we analyze water provision data from the national water utility and compare these to the detailed operational results of the DWSs to estimate the magnitude and efficiency of this alternative mechanism. Second, the principles identified by Elinor Ostrom as being crucial for institutions to successfully manage commons provide us with a fruitful analytic framework to assess DWS performance and sustainability. We show that some of these criteria are broadly met, but the fulfillment of other criteria is still uncertain. We conclude with a balanced assessment of the efficiency and sustainability of this approach and identify the key challenges. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This article introduces the SWAT-AG (a modified SWAT for agro-hydrological modeling) as an enhanced hydrological model for simulating the hydrological processes in agricultural watershed with shallow water tables. The model is developed based on the framework of the SWAT with significant improvements on describing the interactions of the vadose zone water, groundwater, salt and plant growth. The main features of the SWAT-AG include that it can simulate the close interactions of soil water and shallow groundwater with considering the capillary rise effects; it provides functions to simulate the soil salt movement and salt-stress on plant growth; and it incorporates a balance-based module on a sub-basin scale for shallow aquifer with involving canal seepage and ditch drainage calculation. Model testing and application were conducted in Jiyuan Irrigation System located in the Hetao of upper Yellow River basin, northwest China. The comparison between simulated and observed data showed that the SWAT-AG performed well and obviously better than the original SWAT in simulating the soil water and salt dynamics, groundwater depth fluctuations, and plant growth and water consumption. The results showed that the NSE averagely increased from -17.57 to 0.57 and from 0.71 to 0.79 for soil water storage and leaf area index, respectively, in typical croplands and natural patches. In addition, the effects of shallow groundwater in sustaining the agro-ecosystems were reasonably revealed with the spatial analysis of evapo-transpiration, capillary rise and salt accumulation. The test case proved that the proposed SWAT-AG could efficiently enhance the functionality and practicality of hydrological models for agricultural watersheds with shallow groundwater.

AB Identifying the flood susceptible areas is a vital and substantial element of disaster management for every country to control and mitigate injuries of the natural hazards. The current research presents a framework for the preparation of flood prone areas' maps by the integration of Geospatial Information System (GIS), fuzzy logic, and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). To achieve this goal, a spectrum of geophysical, geomorphological, meteorological, hydrological, and geographical criteria have been addressed. Considering the linkage and the interdependencies of the criteria, DEcision-MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach are used to form the network of relations among the criteria. Moreover, considering inevitable uncertainty, ambiguity/vagueness of the experts' opinions, fuzzy theory is integrated with DEMATEL to handle the issue. Finally, Analytic Network Process (ANP) are implemented to calculate the final weight of every single criterion. The Kurdistan province, located in the North-West of Iran, is considered as the case study in which numerous flood events has had recently happened. The efficiency of the model is assessed through the area under the curve (AUC) and statistical measures such as the Kappa index. In order to evaluate the produced classified flood susceptibility map, the map of historical flood events in the province is also used. About 85% of validation area is classified as "Very High flood Susceptible" which implies the efficiency of proposed framework for flood susceptibility mapping. Furthermore, for evaluating the functionality of the framework in comparison with traditional approaches, the well-known AHP methodology is implemented too. The validation results demonstrate that the Fuzzy-DEMATEL ANP model (AUC-ROC = 0.938, Kappa = 0.88) has a higher performance accuracy compare to the AHP model (AUC-ROC = 0.918, Kappa = 0.79). Moreover, comparing the proposed and validation model shows that the proposed framework can effectively improve decision makers to provide flood susceptibility maps, and recognize flood susceptible areas in data-scarce and ungauged regions.

AB We explored the feasibility of an improved design of a CO2 leakage monitoring network at a geologic storage site. To effectively represent CO2 pathways, a rule-based percolation model was adopted rather than the rigorous multiphase flow model based on Darcy's equation. Five different monitoring network designs were compared using a few scenarios and multiple correlated random field realizations. The ensemble results showed that given the detection uncertainty across the entire sensor network, regular spacing deployment of sensors is the most effective method when a sufficient number of sensors is available. The results also showed that an aggressive monitoring design based on information of the spatial permeability distribution near the surface can be a viable method when a limited number of sensors is employed. However, such an aggressive design can lead to elevated uncertainty in leakage detectability.

AB Cave monitoring is crucial for the interpretation of climatic and environmental significances of various geological proxies in speleothem. Therefore, the hydrochemical and stable isotopic compositions (delta O-18, delta D, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, and Ba/Ca) of karst cave waters during 2005-2016 CE were constantly monitored in Furong Cave, Chongqing City, Southwest China. A comparison with local hydrological conditions led to 4 main conclusions as follows: (1) the Mg/Ca ratio is significantly responsive to the changes in drought/wet conditions outside the cave, which increased in drought years and decreased in wet years, respectively. Seasonal variation of Sr/Ca is more significant than those of Mg/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios. (2) Prior calcite precipitation (PCP), incongruent calcite dissolution (ICD), water-rock interaction (WRI), and pCO(2) of soil and cave air, may account for the changes in trace element ratios in the epikarst, which resulted in a complex variation of element ratios in the cave drip water. In general, WRI in drought years is stronger than that in wet years, and that in low discharge sites is stronger than in high discharge sites. Seasonal variation of Ca(2+)concentration, induced by PCP, exerts significant impact on the evolution of Sr/Ca ratio in drip water. (3) delta O-18 and delta D of drip water are influenced by the "mixing effect", leading to the result that their seasonal variations are less significant than that of precipitation. (4) At least in the study period, the ratios of trace elements in the drip water in Furong Cave mainly reflected the variations of local hydrological conditions (drought or wet) dominated by precipitation. Because of the "mixing effect" of groundwater, high-resolution delta O-18 record (e.g., seasonal and annual) of speleothem in Furong Cave may not be recommendable. However, the delta O-18 is potentially a reliable proxy in speleothems to record the change of rainfall on decadal and longer timescales.

ID GROUNDWATER-FLOW; TOMOGRAPHY
AB Localizing leaks of water and fluids from storage tanks and water reservoirs with geomembranes is an important task for a variety of environmental applications and water resources applications. The minimally intrusive mise-a-la-masse method is used to detect leaks with the current injected inside the reservoir and a return current electrode located remotely. We test a new approach for the inversion of the voltage data using sandbox experiments and numerical modeling. A method similar to the self-potential inversion method is proposed to inverse the voltages recorded around the tank or reservoir. A global objective function with a data misfit term and regularization term is minimized to invert the voltages. In the inversion process, a depth-weighting matrix is used to strengthen the depth resolution of the current source, and the minimum support method is used to avoid oversmoothed results in terms of leak detection. The distributions of electrical current density on the walls of reservoir indicate the position of leaks. The results show that the inversion method with source compaction accurately identifies the location of single leaks. For two separated leaks, there is an obvious bias for the deeper hole and the bias increases with its depth. For three holes, the source compaction method generally identifies the location of the three leaks when their depth ranges are similar. When one of the leaks becomes deeper, localization of the deeper one becomes more difficult. The influence of the size of the leak on the inversion results is also investigated. The inversion algorithm overestimates the depth of small leaks while it slightly underestimates the depth of large leaks. For a leak having the form of a crack, the inversion results using the source compaction method agree with the position of the leak and its shape.

AB Different river networks in nature have distinct features depending on regional constraints; these affect the development of the river network and form different characteristics. The differences in drainage networks help in distinguishing between various network types and understanding natural processes. The aim of this study is to develop a new and simple classification method for determining various river network types based on a critical parameter of river networks, the tributary junction angle. For the analysis, fifty river networks are predefined as five network types (dendritic, parallel, pinnate, rectangular, and trellis networks). The tributary junction angles are calculated for each drainage network type, and then the beta distribution is employed to identify distributional characteristics of the junction angles. Parameter estimates of the beta distribution are used to classify different river networks because the estimates provide classified features of natural processes. Support Vector Machines are then utilized to determine the network classification with the parameter estimates. Furthermore, the results are validated against classification using a different approach with commonly used statistics. The proposed method can clearly distinguish between different network types, except for the rectangular and trellis types. In addition, parameter estimates of the beta distribution indicate differences in drainage network types more clearly than the statistics of the angles. Overall, the parameter estimates of beta distribution have high potential for application to the classification of river networks.

AB Utilizing the readily available, inexpensive, remotely-sensed satellite data products in combination with Markov Chain methods for estimating water levels and discharge anywhere along the vast river networks around the world is one of the most interesting and promising fields in hydrology. This study presents two new extensions of Markov Chain (MC) methods, namely the Online-Markov Chains (O-MC) and Extreme Online-Markov Chains (EO-MC) methods to improve the prediction accuracy. The O-MC method has the advantage of the online implementation of the correct variable states, and the EO-MC method has the advantage of online updating the Markov Matrix (MM) along with the online implementation of the correct variable states. The new O-MC and the EO-MC methods were evaluated using short-term satellites signal predictions for six different case study rivers. The Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis was used to measure the reliability of the new MC-based methods. Each model was developed 1000 times to calculate two indices, namely the 95 Percent Predicted Uncertainties (95PPU) and average distance factor (d-factor). The performances of MC and two extensions of O-MC and EO-MC were also examined for cases where we lack the training data. The Training Percent (TrPr) of the entire dataset gradually decreased from 90% to 1%, and the performance of the models in producing accurate future signals in the non-observed dataset is calculated. The Input Variable Imitation (IVI) problem was considered for the MC-based methods, and the results were compared with the Linear Regression (LR), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and Radial Basis Function (RBF) regression methods. The results showed that the performance of EO-MC and O-MC are better than the simple MC method. In addition, it is concluded that EOMC and O-MC have very similar performance in the uncertainty analysis and both methods are robust techniques. The main advantage of EO-MC compared with the O-MC method is highlighted when the number of training samples are very low. Finally, considering the IVI problem, the new O-MC and EO-MC methods significantly outperformed the LR, MLP, ELM, and RBF methods.

AB Model selection and model averaging have become popular tools to address conceptual uncertainty in hydro (geo)logical modeling. Within the last two decades, many different flavors of approaches and implementations have emerged which complicate an easy access to and a thorough understanding of the underlying principles. With the many approaches and applications, a variety of terms has been defined, which easily leads to misunderstandings and confusion among the community. Here, we review Bayesian model selection (BMS) and averaging (BMA) as a rigorous statistical framework for model choice under uncertainty. We aim to clarify the theoretical foundations of both methods, their relationship to one another and to alternative approaches, and implications of implementation choices. We further build a bridge to Bayesian model combination (BMC) which turns out to be Bayesian averaging or selection of combined models (BCMA/BCMS). Concluding from our theoretical review, we argue that the goal and the philosophical perspective of modeling should be main drivers when choosing to use the B(C)MS/A toolbox, and we offer guidance to identify the suitable approach for specific modeling goals. With this review, we hope to further strengthen the utility of Bayesian methods in the face of conceptual uncertainty by directing their use into the right channels.

AB Flash floods are among the most devastating natural hazards but the analyses of flash floods are hindered by the lack of hydro-meteorological data. In particular, data issues are critical in ungauged basins. This paper presents an investigation of flash flood modeling using coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models. Specifically, the TOPography-based hydrological MODEL (TOPMODEL) is employed to obtain the flood hydrograph and the coupled 1D-2D hydrodynamic model MIKEFLOOD is used to simulate floodplain inundation. The methods are tested in the Pajiang River, a mountainous basin in South China. The results show that the TOPMODEL effectively simulates the flood hydrograph and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of the flow rate are larger than 0.80 for both calibration and validation. Also, MIKEFLOOD effectively simulates the flood inundation extent and flooding depth and the BIAS for simulated water level is - 0.004 m. Further, using socioeconomic and historical flood disaster datasets, areas with high flash flood risk are identified. A flash flood risk assessment shows a clear trend of change in the flood hazard and the spatial heterogeneity of the flood vulnerability is significant. A sensitivity analysis of the flood vulnerability to the socioeconomic indicators indicates that cultivated land is the most sensitive indicators, and the population and the construction areas have similar influences. Overall, the coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models prove effective and can be used in practical applications for flash flood risk mapping.

TI Sensitivity of the response of well-aquifer systems to different

AB Groundwater well can be used as a seismograph or as strainmeter, since the well water level is sensitive to seismic waves and other crustal strains through mechanical coupling between rock and groundwater. The use of the groundwater level in monitoring tectonic strain, however, is hindered by the enigmatic response discrepancy among wells (different responses may be recorded by even closely clustered wells). Therefore, understanding the factors that control the sensitivity of well-aquifer systems in response to different periodic loadings is important. In this paper, we analyzed two closely located wells that show no response to seismic waves and respond differently to earth tides and barometric pressure. We discuss these wells' sensitivity of response to periodic loadings by using the spectrum, barometric response function, tidal response, and slug test methods. Our results show that the different response characteristics are due to the differences in permeability and confinement of the well-aquifer systems. Well-aquifer systems with a low permeability cannot record coseismic responses, even if they can record clear tidal and barometric signals. In addition, periodic loading signals in shallow aquifers will be easily masked by the interference from the surface, for example rainfall or pumping, which diminishes the signal-to-noise ratio of the tectonic activity. Thus, the hydrogeological and tectonic settings are the two key factors that should be considered in choosing a suitable monitoring well location for tectonic strain monitoring.

AB Karst aquifers are geologic media that consist of enlarged solution conduits. The geometry of such conduits is very difficult to delineate and its hydraulic parameters such as hydraulic conductivity (K) and specific storage (S-s) are difficult to estimate. Hydraulic Tomography (HT) shown to successfully map the hydraulic heterogeneity of porous and fractured rock aquifers may also be effective in karst aquifers. In this study, we utilize two synthetic karst aquifers with the Branchwork and Network Conduit Patterns (BCP and NCP) to explore the ability of HT to map conduit patterns and their hydraulic parameters. Prior to the HT analysis, forward models are built to study groundwater flow through synthetic karst aquifers to generate data and to gain insights into flow patterns. Forward modeling results reveal that: (1) flow rates at the outlet of the BCP model is higher than the NCP model even when the same water injection rates are applied at the wells; (2) the location of the injection well has a significant impact on the flow rate at the outlet; and (3) flow lines mainly follow the conduit pattern. These results suggest that the accurate mapping of karst networks is critical. Next, the HT analysis of these data is conducted using a set of six models (BCP and NCP) to map the heterogeneity of different conduit systems under steady state and transient flow conditions. Inverse modeling results reveal that the estimated K maps become more reliable as the number of injection tests and the corresponding monitoring data are increased in the HT analysis. Moreover, the results of the BCP model is closer to the original conduit pattern in comparison to the NCP model. A comparative study of three inverse models with different number of observation wells and assuming the availability of geological data has shown that a more reliable pattern of the conduits can be mapped by adding geological information even when a small number of observation wells are available. Overall, our results confirm the feasibility of HT in detecting major conduits as well as being able to differentiate between the BCP and NCP network types.

AB Determining the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface water in a heterogeneous floodplain is difficult, especially for its surrounding isolated lakes. Seasonal inundation patterns of these isolated lakes can be misestimated in a hydrodynamic model due to their short and erratic appearances. A surface water time series of Poyang Lake having an 8-day revisit frequency with a 30 m spatial resolution from 2000 to 2016 was conducted for the first time. This study was produced with a modified hierarchical spatiotemporal adaptive fusion model (HSTAFM) by integrating both Landsat and MODIS data. Discrepancies between model-based surface water and remotely-sensed surface water were evaluated, and possible causes were discussed. Results show that the modified HSTAFM can better detect the water features of a floodplain, thereby providing more detailed information in an seasonal isolated lake system than the MODIS MOD13Q1 product. With the fusion product, we found that Poyang Lake evidently shrank after experiencing a longer low-water period after the impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam. A large proportion of these discrepancies (averaging 36%) between model-based and remotely-sensed surface water distributed in seasonal isolated lakes, mainly occurred during high-water level periods. Uncertainties in the hydrodynamic model might attribute to smaller defined lake boundaries, bathymetric variations, human disturbance, and unconsidered groundwater recharge/discharge. These results provide a new insight into the temporally continuous and spatially dynamic assessment of simulated surface water, which is essential for the future improvement in the hydrodynamic model.

AB Understanding the environmental impacts associated with water-related adaptation measures plays an important role in decision making, as some adaptation measures may not offer environmental benefits compared to traditional water systems. The water depletion index (WDI) is one water stress indicator used to estimate the impacts of water consumption. A dynamic WDI was constructed and employed in this study under climate change scenarios with weather and streamflow modeling. To demonstrate whether adaptation measures can reduce water depletion and to demonstrate how dynamic WDI affects assessment results, Taipei, a highly developed and populated city in Taiwan, was selected as a case study site. Decreased WDI from July to August and increased WDI from September to October were simulated under climate change. This approach implied that when measuring water consumption impacts, the WDI should be applied according to the corresponding time period. Additionally, by substituting 70% of potable water with rainwater in a four-story building, 17.9-159.3 m(3) of the freshwater depletion risk might be reduced every month. As adaptation measures can be long-term strategies and long-lasting infrastructures, a dynamic WDI could provide policy makers with a method to accurately and effectively assess the impacts of applying water-related adaptation measures in response to climate change.

TI Tree-ring reconstruction of Lhasa River streamflow reveals 472 years of

AB The Lhasa River is the largest tributary of the Yarlung Zangbo River, provides up to 85% of the water supply for the city of Lhasa, and has a high ecologic and economic importance. Annual streamflow of the Lhasa River is reconstructed from Juniperus tibetica tree rings. The streamflow reconstruction developed for the southern Tibetan Plateau goes back to 1546 CE and has a R-2 of 0.485. Spectral and wavelet analysis indicates the existence of decadal (34 and 16 years) and interannual (8.1, 5.7, 4.8, 3.8, 3.5, 3.2, 2.7, 2.3 and 2.1 years) cycles that may reflect climate forcings. Lhasa River streamflow is significantly correlated with precipitation over a vast part of the Yarlung Zangbo River basin, and represents streamflow of the upper Yarlung Zangbo River to a certain extent. Lhasa River variation is linked with large-scale climate circulation features, such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Asian summer monsoon. Some years of abnormally high and low streamflow are related to ENSO events. Based on the reconstruction, the probability that annual streamflow does not exceed a target defined as the instrumental-period mean was lower (48% non-exceedance probability) than during the instrumental period. This study indicates that the instrumental record does not contain the full range of streamflow, especially the lowest streamflow events, and the reconstruction makes up for this shortcoming. Future water resource supply planning based on the instrumental record and streamflow reconstructions will be able to effectively reduce the risks posed by climate change.

AB Extreme rainfall is the most common cause of flooding and likelihood of such events is found to increase in recent studies. Large scale natural variability, human induced global warming and local atmospheric warming are important drivers of extreme rainfall. Understanding the association of these drivers with extreme rainfall and finding out the most significant physical driver will provide a foundation for risk assessment. This study presents a methodology to investigate the association of extreme rainfall events with physical drivers and to model their dependence structure. The methodology is demonstrated with application to Mahanadi River basin, India. Non-stationary extreme value models with multivariate ENSO index, global average temperature anomalies and local mean temperature anomalies as covariates are fitted at non-stationary rainfall grids of the basin. Statistical modelling confirms localized temperature to be the main driver influencing rainfall extremes. Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) scaling curves relating daily rainfall extremes and local mean temperature are developed at all the grids to obtain insights into warming induced changes in rainfall extremes. Significant deviations from the expected CC scaling behaviour are observed. Daily rainfall extremes show peaks at low (25 degrees C) to medium (30 degrees C) range of temperature, but exhibit a decrease at high temperatures for most of the grids. No change in this pattern of relationship is observed when the extreme rainfall is lagged by 1-9 days with temperature. This time lag is selected based on the concept of residence time of water in the atmosphere. The Copula theory is applied to capture the dependence of annual maximum daily rainfall and temperature extremes. Conditional probabilities of extreme rainfall are estimated by conditioning on local mean temperature values of strongest extreme rainfall events. Comparison of conditional probabilities suggests that stronger rainfall events are occurring at 30 degrees C. This study emphasizes the necessity of understanding the dependence structure of extreme rainfall and local mean temperature.

AB Few studies have fully considered how hydrological inputs and climate influence the linkage between the oxygen isotopic composition of alpha-cellulose (delta O-18(cell)) and their source waters in vascular-plant-dominated alpine peatlands. In this study, in order to test whether delta O-18(cell) can be used as a hydroclimatic indicator, we investigated the relationship between the delta O-18 values of cellulose extracted from the dominant plant species (Carex pamirensis) and those of potential source waters during two growing seasons (from May to September) in the Sahara sand peatland in the southern Altai Mountains. Concurrently, the Roden-Lin-Ehleringer (RLE) mechanistic model was applied to better understand oxygen isotopic fractionation during cellulose synthesis. We found that the meltwater from snow/ice cover and seasonally-frozen soil played a critical role in controlling the hydrological processes in this alpine peatland. The delta O-18 values of both swale water and soil water responded more sensitively to variations in inflow meltwater than did summer precipitation. IsoSource modelling demonstrated that the mean 76-24% split between meltwater and summer precipitation inputs determined the overall isotopic composition of the peatland water. The slopes of the peatland water line (6.38) and meltwater line (6.87) were slightly lower than that of the local meteoric water line (LMWL) (7.72), suggesting limited evaporation from these external water sources due to the relatively high humidity (73-80%) in the studied fen. However, the slopes of the stem water line (4.53) and leaf water line (157) were generally lower than that of the LMWL, indicating that the internal plant waters have experienced isotopic enrichment during transpiration. Interestingly, the variations of delta O-18(cell) (of shoots, stems and leaves) fall within a relatively narrow range ( < +/- 3 parts per thousand), which is mainly attributed to a nearly constant monthly net O-18 enrichment factor (11.13 +/- 1.07 parts per thousand for Delta(Modelled)), together with a smoothing effect. Furthermore, empirical correlation and RLE modeling both showed the co-variation of external source water and cellulose synthesis, demonstrating that the cellulose oxygen isotope composition of C. pamirensis can faithfully reflect variations in soil/swale water. These findings strongly suggest that inflow meltwater is the dominant water source in determining delta O-18(cell), implying that the delta O-18(p) signals of precipitation in the winter half-year (October-April) may be inherited by the delta O-18(cell) values of C. pamirensis at the study site. Therefore, our results provide important insights for the hydroclimatic interpretation of past variations in delta O-18(cell) values in vascular plants in alpine peatlands.

AB Climate change and urbanization are currently leading to a warming of the subsurface worldwide with yet unforeseen consequences for groundwater quality. The temperature-sensitivity of chemical and biological processes suggests that small temperature changes driven by current warming should have a detectable effect on the ecology of aquifers and the composition of groundwater itself, but field observations covering temperatures that are environmentally relevant are sparse. The analysis of a large data set provides field-scale evidence that, within the naturally occurring temperature range between 5 and 20 degrees C, temperature affects the quality of groundwater. A difference in temperature of + 1 K is linked to a 4% decline in oxygen saturation and a pH drop of 0.02 due to the accumulation of carbon dioxide. Further, warmer groundwater shows signs of enhanced mineral weathering and higher concentrations of drinking water-relevant elements such as manganese. The observed trends in groundwater quality are consistent with a temperature-associated intensification of microbial metabolic rates and enhanced organic matter mineralization at warmer temperatures either within the aquifers or in the overlying soils. A times series analysis reveals that soil and groundwater temperatures in the studied area have been increasing at a rate of 0.1-0.4 K per decade -comparable to recent global warming- driving subtle, but distinct changes in groundwater pH and oxygen concentrations. The results confirm, that certain but central aspects of groundwater quality (pH, O-2, pCO(2), Mn, DOC) change due to warming, which may increase the costs for purification when drinking water is produced from groundwater resources and may turn some aquifers uninhabitable for groundwater biota.

AB Predicting the bulk cross-sectional average flow velocity in open channels with submerged vegetation is an important topic in river engineering. Researchers have proposed numerous theoretical and empirical formulae, but the accuracy and physical basis of their solutions still need improvement. This study separates the flow into vegetation layer and surface layer, following conventional two-layer approach, and estimates the average velocities in these two layers separately. In the vegetation layer, force balance equation provides the basement of the estimation. And in the surface layer, we use genetic programming (GP), a data-driven method. A Darcy-Weisbach-coefficient-like parameter is proposed for the surface layer, which is related to other parameters through the GP algorithm. The maximum dissimilarity algorithm (a data-clustering algorithm) is used to separate the existing data sets in the training, validation, and testing groups to feed GP algorithm. Finally, by weighted combination, a new velocity formula with high accuracy and physical basis is proposed for submerged vegetated flow.

AB Groundwater is an important resource for drinking water supply, and is subject to natural variation as well as climate change effects. It has been shown that long-term natural variations of groundwater levels can often be attributed to climatic oscillations. Long-term groundwater level records are rare, but of special importance for the detection of longer, decadal to multi-decadal periodicities, which are vital for predictions of future development of groundwater levels and the distinction between natural variation and climate change effects. We have examined periodicities of nine groundwater level time-series with records of more than 100 years, as well as possible impacts of climatic teleconnections (NAO, AMO and ENSO) with wavelet analysis. The monitoring wells are located in Germany, Netherlands, UK and Denmark and cover different depths to groundwater, different aquifer types and hydraulic conditions. Our results show that all evaluated monitoring wells exhibit significant relations to long-term climatic periodicities of NAO, AMO and ENSO. Among the wells in phreatic porous aquifers, there is a signal damping, which can be related to the thickness of the unsaturated zone. Further, the damping is higher in the lower permeable aquifers and there is less damping in the karstic aquifers compared to the porous aquifers, in spite of a much thicker unsaturated zone.

AB Compound dry-hot events have attracted much attention due to their amplified impacts on water resources, crop productions, and ecosystems. Thus accurate prediction of such events is of critical importance for issuing early warning to make informed decisions. This study proposed to employ a meta-Gaussian model for the prediction of the severity of compound dry-hot events in Southern Africa, based on the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which has been shown to affect these events in this region. To represent the severity of compound dry-hot events, a Standardized Compound Event Indicator (SCEI) was used to integrate both dry and hot conditions. The SCEI was predicted based on the conditional distribution constructed from the meta-Gaussian model, in which the antecedent SCEI (i.e., the persistence) and ENSO (i.e., the external forcing factor) were used as predictors. The 1-month and 3-month lead prediction of compound dry-hot events in Southern Africa was assessed and results showed good prediction performances. The compound dry-hot event during December 2015 in Southern Africa was used as a case study and the proposed approach performed well in predicting the severity and probability of this event, which was likely due to the strong impact of ENSO in antecedent periods.

AB Information on the amount of water held by woodchips in the field is needed to assess environmental risks when they are kept in stockpiles or for inferring their efficiency as denitrifying bioreactors. Reflectometry is a widely used method for estimating volumetric water content (theta) in permeable media, but material-specific calibration functions should be developed. This study aimed at developing relationships between the bulk dielectric permittivity (root epsilon(b)) and theta in woodchips considering their particle size distribution (PSD), temperature (T) and the dielectric permittivity of the dry material plus air (root epsilon(sa)). The root epsilon(b) of fine, medium and coarse PSDs were measured with CS616-L water content reflectometers up to theta of 0.83 cm(3)/cm(3) and at T (degrees C) of 10 degrees, 24 degrees, 37 degrees, 55 degrees and 70 degrees. Calibration equations were developed using a multivariate power law function fitted to the data with a hierarchical Bayesian inference procedure. The best fit (R-2 = 0.96; RMSE = 0.04 cm(3)/cm(3)) was obtained for the fine PSD (root epsilon(sa) similar to 1.09); while medium (root epsilon(sa) similar to 1.09) and coarse (root epsilon(sa) similar to 1.03) PSDs were more influenced by T and the presence of large air voids (R-2 similar to 0.92; RMSE - 0.06 cm(3)/cm(3)). A modified calibration equation independent of PSD (root epsilon(sa) = 1) reduced only slightly the goodness-of-fit (R-2 = 0.90; RMSE = 0.07 cm(3)/cm(3)). The equations developed in this study are well suited for field applications as they cover a wider range of theta than previously published functions and they are applicable within the range of T found in field applications.

AB In this study, several advanced data-driven models are adopted for estimating water table levels in conjunction with a proposed data preprocessing procedure that includes detrending, deseasonalization, normalization, outlier exclusion, and formatting. To verify the proposed strategy, a non-linear auto-regressive exogenous model based on deep neural networks (NARX-DNNs), a long-short term memory (LSTM) model, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model, and a reference model based on an auto-regressive exogenous (ARX) model are comparatively applied to water table level time series from the Jindo Uisin and Pohang Gibuk monitoring wells (years 2005-2014). To test the developed preprocessing method, estimates with and without the proposed detrending and deseasonalization (DTDS) are compared quantitatively. In the comparative applications, all four models show reasonable prediction accuracies. In addition, it is found that the estimations from the NARX and LSTM models are superior to those of the other models in terms of prediction accuracy, regardless of whether DTDS is adopted. In both data sets, there is water table level depression during 2014 due to drought throughout the entire Korean peninsula. In multiple analyses, stressed aquifer conditions are identified through estimations based on differences between estimates and observations, where the differences are found to be more obvious with DTDS preprocessing. Thus, by using the proposed preprocessing method, hydrologically stressed conditions in an aquifer can be effectively noticed at an earlier stage. The results show that the advanced data-driven models can be more effective when adopted in conjunction with the proposed preprocessing method and successfully utilized for monitoring and management of groundwater resources.

AB A three-dimensional coupled groundwater reactive transport and equilibrium chemistry model is presented that simulates the fate and transport of major salt ions in agricultural groundwater systems that span broad regions. The UZF-RT3D/SEC model amends the base model UZF-RT3D by coupling it with a new Salinity Equilibrium Chemistry (SEC) module to simulate the movement and transformation of major salt ions (calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, sulfate, chloride, bicarbonate, and carbonate) due to advection, dispersion, source/sink mixing, sulfur cycling, redox reactions, precipitation-dissolution, aqueous complexation, and cation exchange. The coupling procedure and the considered reactions make the model applicable for simulating regional-scale agricultural aquifer systems with data efficiency and an acceptable processing time. The model receives flow information from the MODFLOW-UZF flow model, which simulates variably-saturated groundwater flow in an efficient manner over regional scales. For use in agricultural areas, the model also accounts for crop uptake, soil organic matter decomposition, and mineralization/immobilization of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur species. The model is applied to a salinity-impaired regional-scale (500 km(2)) agricultural area within the irrigated valley of the Arkansas River in southeastern Colorado. It is calibrated and tested against salt ion groundwater concentrations measured in monitoring wells, soil salinity measurements from throughout the region, and total salt loads discharging from the aquifer to the stream network of the Arkansas River. Results indicate that the model represents well the overall magnitude and spatiotemporal trends of soil salinity and groundwater salinity in the aquifer, along with salt loading to streams, and therefore can be used to investigate best management practices for salt remediation. This, along with findings indicating that the inclusion of equilibrium chemistry is vital for producing the correct magnitude of salt ion concentrations and mass loadings, render a tool useful for regional investigation of other highly-salinized aquifer systems.

AB Drought is a recurring natural hazard that significantly affects the economy and environment of large areas worldwide. It is therefore imperative to develop techniques that enable comprehensive monitoring and assessment of drought. Here we propose a novel drought index (Combined Climatologic Deviation Index (CCDI)) that encompasses all the aspects of meteorologic, agricultural, hydrologic and human-induced drought occurrences. Critical to the proposed framework is the concept of combining deviations in precipitation and terrestrial water storage, observed by Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites, from climatologic (normal) conditions as a measure of drought. In order to evaluate the applicability of this new index, it is analyzed over four major river basins in India (i.e. Ganga, Krishna, Godavari and Mahanadi). The propounded drought index (CCDI) has demonstrated its ability to identify drought events and render rational quantification of its severity. Results also depict an improved understanding of holistic drought conditions compared to other available drought indices. Comparison of CCDI with commonly used drought indices highlighted some of the fundamental differences while demonstrating good correspondence with PDSI (r = 0.79) and GRACE DSI (r = 0.94). Further, it is evident that in almost all the river basins there have been at least two drought periods with intensities ranging from D1 (moderate drought) to D4 (exceptional drought). The longest drought period, extending for 36 months, from July 2002 to June 2005, is observed in the Krishna Basin. Results from this study show appreciable reliance on the potential for quantifying droughts using CCDI, which will only improve with better quantification and extended availability of terrestrial water storage observations from the recently launched GRACE-Follow On mission.

AB Among various stream temperature models those based on nonlinear regression frequently attract attention due to their simplicity and small number of required variables. Among such approaches the logistic regression model developed twenty years ago for weekly data is still widely used in various scientific studies that require quick and simple calculation of stream water temperature. The model has been modified a number of times in recent years to capture the relationship between daily stream water temperatures, air temperatures and discharge. In this study, we propose further modifications of the logistic regression model that do not require any additional variables that may be hard to measure. The proposed models capture the relationship between the stream temperature and the declination of the Sun, the air temperature and the discharge from a number of recent observations. The proposed approaches are tested on six rivers located in diverse orographic conditions of temperate climate zones of Europe and USA. Although the proposed models remain very simple, their performances are competitive against the performances of more advanced semi-physical or data-driven models.

AB Large-scale vegetation restoration generally reduces local water yield and influences river ecosystem health. Thus, scientific evaluation of vegetation restoration consequences is necessary for maintaining the stability of the surface water system and water cycle in semi-arid regions. In this study, we compared the efficiencies of different typical grasslands in regulating runoff and sediment yields and proposed feasible suggestions suiting for local environments. Four grasslands, including two Gramineae species (Elymus dahuricus and Bromus inermis) and two legume species (Medicago saliva and Trifolium repens), were tested during a two-year period with simulated rainfall experiments, and using bare land as control. Three replicates were done for each treatment, and fifteen plots with a slope of 20 degrees were constructed. Three indices were used to assess the runoff and sediment yields reduction capacity of the grasslands, including runoff reduction benefit (RRB), sediment reduction benefit (SRB), and soil infiltration rate (SIR). The results showed that RRB and SRB were significantly different (P < 0.05) among treatments across the two-year experiments. The values of SRB increased considerably in the second year. In particular, the values of SRB for E. dahuricus and B. inermis was 98.79% and 98.07%, respectively, while that of RRB was - 11.84% and 4.01%, respectively. The two Gramineae grasslands showed greater effectiveness in sediment reduction and runoff maintenance than the two legume species owing to the dense fibrous roots and higher biological soil crust coverage. Therefore, Gramineae grasslands can be considered as a suitable management practice to achieve the socio-ecological sustainability of the semi-arid areas during vegetation restoration.

AB This study is a review to the special issue on artificial intelligence (AI) methods for groundwater level (GWL) modeling and forecasting, and presents a brief overview of the most popular AI techniques, along with the bibliographic reviews of the experiences of the authors over past years, and the reviewing and comparison of the obtained results. Accordingly, 67 journal papers published from 2001 to 2018 were reviewed in the terms of the features and abilities of the modeling approaches, input data consideration, prediction time steps, data division, etc. From the reviewed papers it can be concluded that despite some weaknesses, if the AI methods properly be developed, they can successfully be used to simulate and forecast the GWL time series in different aquifers. Since some of the stages of the AI modeling are based on the experience or trial-and-error procedures, it is useful to review them in the special application on GWL modeling. Many partial and general results were achieved from the reviewed papers, which can provide applicable guidelines for researchers who want to perform similar works in this field. Several new ideas in the related area of research are also presented in this study for developing innovative methods and for improving the quality of the modeling.

The use of classical filtering to eliminate disturbances carries the risk of removing an important part of the information about the useful signal. In order to avoid this phenomenon, optimal filters are used, utilizing the statistical properties of signals. Such a case of consideration concerns the issue of estimation for stochastic systems. An example is the Kalman filter in which the main aspect of research is the differential equation of the state estimate in which there is an amplification factor dependent on the covariance matrix of the estimation error. The value of this factor is determined from the non-linear Riccati differential equation, depending on the characteristics of signals affecting the object under investigation and the measurement. The paper proposes an adaptive algorithm to determine the value of the filter amplification factor which allows to avoid the inconveniences resulting from the need to estimate the characteristics of signals affecting the object under investigation. The presented approach to estimation issues does not require the need to characterize random signals due to the application of the adaptive method of state estimation. The analyzed process refers to an object described by ordinary differential equations with continuous measurements representing the state of pollution of the river using the so-called interpretation "along the characteristics". The method used in the module of the intelligent analytical system allows for quick determination of hard-to-measure parameters of the quality of water in the river and to react to upcoming ecological threats without any delays dangerous for the system.

AB The theoretical examination of the combined effect of water table configuration and heat transfer is relevant to improve understanding of deep groundwater systems, not only in siliciclastic sedimentary basins, but also in fractured rocks or karstified carbonates. Numerical model calculations have been carried out to investigate the interaction of topography-driven forced and buoyancy-driven free thermal convection in a synthetic, two-dimensional model. Effects of numerous model parameters were systematically studied in order to examine their influence on the Darcy flux, the temperature and the hydraulic head field. It was established that higher geothermal gradients and greater model depths facilitate the evolution of time-dependent free thermal convection in agreement with changes of the thermal Rayleigh number and the modified Peclet number. However, increasing water table slope and anisotropy coefficient favor the formation of stationary forced thermal convection. Free thermal convection mainly affects the deeper part of the midline and the discharge zone of the synthetic model. In the examined model basins, the position of the maximum hydraulic head is located within the bottom thermal boundary layer near the recharge zone. This divergent stagnation point underlies a local downwelling zone characterized by underpressure. These simulations draw attention to the importance of understanding the combined effect of forced and free thermal convection in sedimentary basins regarding regional groundwater flow patterns, and temperature distributions.

AB Designing effective management strategies for lake ecosystems requires an understanding of regional differences, interannual variability, and other drivers affecting the availability of nutrients to algae. In this study, generalized additive models (GAMs) based on meteorological factors and geographic location were developed to quantitatively estimate the availability of nutrients to algae (as represented by the ratio of Chlorophyll a (Chl a) to total phosphorus (TP) or total nitrogen (TN)) across 167 Chinese freshwater lakes and reservoirs. This model was then used to produce the first spatial and temporal estimates of Chl a/TP and Chl a/TN within mainland China from 1987 to 2016. The results revealed high spatial variability driven primarily by geographic location, which explained 58.86% of the observed variability in Chl a/TP (41.98% in Chl a/TN). In addition, high interannual variability was driven by annual average temperature for both Chl a/TP and Chl a/TN. These results point to a fundamental challenge in managing regions with high nutrient levels, because these regions also tend to exhibit the strongest interannual variability, such that the impact of changes in management practices will be modulated by meteorological variability. In addition, this study provides regionalization indicators that serve as a quantitative foundation for formulating nutrient ecoregions to better administer lakes and reservoirs in China. It is therefore imperative that models combining meteorological factors with geographic location are further developed to improve the simulation of spatio-temporal variability in the availability of nutrients to algae.

AB In recent years, continuous improvements have been made in weather forecasting and flood prediction with great benefit from Early Warning Systems (EWSs). Despite the continuous quest for innovation from the scientific and user communities, EWSs remain based mostly on hazard forecast, and the information on possible consequences and potential impacts is generally missing.
   In this work, a methodology for quantitative real-time impact assessment for flash floods is presented. The methodology uses a multi-model ensemble approach and considers soil moisture uncertainty. Moreover, the flood forecasting chain, which normally provides only the discharge probability of exceeding a given threshold, is extended to include a fully 2D hydraulic model and a damage estimation model to quantitatively assess impacts in terms of economic losses and the people involved.
   The procedure was tested on recent flood events occurring in Genoa in northwestern Italy. This paper discusses the potential challenges and opportunities offered by this approach in the decision-making workflow in an operational context.

AB Simple models capable of describing spatial and temporal patterns of pollutants are needed to understand surface water quality and to identify the main processes that influence the fate and transport of pollutants. This study combines exploratory factor analysis with multilevel and structural equation modeling to: find spatial and temporal patterns of metal and metalloids in the Ctalamochita River Basin (Argentina); identify the processes responsible for the occurrence of these elements; and, establish relationships between latent variables of different aquatic compartments. For this purpose, the metal and metalloid concentration in different matrices was analyzed at sampling sites along 330 km of the river course, including seasonal variations. Our results indicate that the concentration of natural occurring elements in surface water increased downstream the catchment and during the warm-rainy season, as a consequence of surface runoff and groundwater discharge. In contrast, the spatial and seasonal variation in sediment showed an inverse pattern (negative correlation) compared to surface water. On the other hand, copper, zinc and lead were derived from anthropogenic sources, such as old mining areas and metal industries. Moreover, the input of these metals into the river evidenced a direct effect of surface water on sediment, Overall, the combined use of multilevel model and SEM allowed for a proper description of spatial and temporal patterns of metals and metalloids in the catchment, and successfully highlighted sources and processes influencing metal transport. The proposed methodological framework could be extended to wider spatial scales including nested regions, and could be applied to environmental studies dealing with repeated observations and multiple matrices.

AB Urban residents are becoming more aware of water scarcity issues and paying greater attention to their total water consumption. Simultaneously, perceptions of what is considered drinkable water are also evolving. The present study examines whether attitudinal evaluations of stormwater influence the public acceptance of stormwater that is treated and sourced through managed aquifer recharge (MAR). It was hypothesised that treated stormwater used for non-potable purposes would be more acceptable amongst participants, and that select psychological factors (perceptions, values and norms) would be significant predictors of public acceptance for MAR. Participants (N = 408) took part in an online survey which measured public acceptance of stormwater, social norms, stormwater attitudes, water beliefs and water conservation culture. These factors were experimentally examined across two different types of water use: "drinking water" or "non-drinking water". Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that stormwater end use and selected psychological factors accounted for 79% of variance in acceptance of stormwater. While there was significantly higher acceptance for the use of MAR for non-drinking purposes overall, 'end use' was a weak predictor of public acceptance for MAR. The most important predictors of acceptance were social norms and value-driven attitudes towards stormwater. Results showed that perceptions of approval from important others (e.g. family and friends) and personal moral values were influential in explaining acceptance for stormwater. Interestingly, water conservation culture was a negative predictor of acceptance, where people who believed that conserving water was part of the Australian lifestyle tended to have lower acceptance for a supplemental stormwater supply. These people were more likely to support initiatives encouraging conservation of water use as key to managing water supplies. The findings articulate the need to consider existing public attitudes and norms within communities where alternative resources are proposed, to inform policy and practice.

AB Balancing the multiple purposes of reservoir operation, including the social, economic, and ecological aspects, has become one of the most complicated problems facing the managers and operators worldwide. This paper formulates a detailed mathematical model to optimize the reservoir operation during the flood season, considering the three major operational purposes, i.e. flood control (social purpose), energy production (economic purpose), and management of sediment transport (ecological purpose). The entire formulations conform to a nonlinear programming (NLP) model, which can be solved effectively and efficiently by the Multi-Start Solver from the LINGO software through equivalent transformation. This model is applied to the Three Gorges Project (TGP) in China, which is the world's largest and most complex hydraulic engineering in operation. Three typical flood hydrographs (i.e. dry, normal, and wet scenarios) are selected as model inputs under the three strategies (i.e. design operating rules, increasing the flood control water level (FCWL), and impounding in advance). The trade-offs among these three major operational purposes are quantitatively analyzed. Moreover, phosphorus (P), one of the sediment-associated environmental factors, is introduced for exploring its responses to various scenarios and strategies. Results indicate that a higher fore-bay water level leads to a greater energy production, a smaller flood peak but less sediment and P transports to the downstream. Under the design operating rules, the maximum energy production of the TGP can reach 560,620, and 699 x 10(8) KWh, respectively, in dry, normal, and wet scenarios, corresponding to a flood peak of 25000-27500 m(3)/s, a sediment load of 1517-1999 x 10(4) t, and a P load of 3152-3740 x 10(4) kg to the downstream. Whereas, the maximum sediment loads are 2796,4640, and 5377 x 10(4) t, and the maximum P loads are 4021,5345, and 5784 x 10(4) kg, respectively, in dry, normal, and wet scenarios, corresponding to an energy production of 500-588 x 10(8) KWh, and a flood peak of 38600-52500 m(3)/s to the downstream. In terms of achieving the comprehensive benefits of the TGP, impounding in advance is a better choice than both the design operating rules and increasing the FCWL, for it can increase the energy production and the probability of full refill with almost no increase in flood risk to both the dam and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River as well as smaller reduction in the sediment and P transports. The formulated detailed mathematical model is a general one that is applicable to a variety of reservoirs owning multiple operational purposes. Moreover, the achievements gained from this paper will provide important references for the managers and operators.

AB Groundwater is one of the most beneficial natural resources worldwide. The main aim of the present study is the mapping of groundwater potential of the Zhangjiamao area in China using two novel hybrid data mining techniques that involve the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) ensembled with teaching-learningbased optimization (TLBO) and biogeography-based optimization (BBO). First, 93 spring locations were identified in the study area, which were randomly divided in the ratio of 70:30 to be used for building models and validation, respectively. A total of 16 spring affecting factors viz., slope aspect, altitude, slope angle, plan curvature, profile curvature, curvature, sediment transport index, stream power index, topographic wetness index, distance to roads, distance to rivers, rainfall, lithology, soil, NDVI, and land use/land cover, were used as input variables. The probability certainty factor (PCF) method was applied for the correlation analysis between spring occurrences and the affecting factors. Subsequently, the ANFIS-TLBO and ANFIS-BBO models were generated to produce groundwater spring potential maps (GSPMs). Finally, the GSPMs were evaluated by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC). The results showed that the AUROC values for the ANFIS-TLBO model based on the training and validation datasets were 0.866 and 0.905, respectively. In contrast, the AUROC values for the ANFIS-BBO model based on the training and validation datasets were 0.861 and 0.887, respectively. The results of ANFIS-TLBO showed that 25.66% of the study area could be classified into the high and very high groundwater spring potential classes as compared to the ANFIS-BBO model (30.52%). The results of the present study can be useful for groundwater management.

AB Rainfall data scarcity has caused enormous problems in hydrologic and non-point pollution (H/NPS) predictions, as rainfall data represent the key input to watershed models. In this study, the effects of different imputation methods such as the data augmentation (DA) and the expectation maximization with bootstrap (EMB) algorithms on rainfall data scarcity were compared. The effects of different data scarcity rates and periods on model performance and prediction uncertainty were then quantified. Finally, the effects of different imputed data sets on H/NPS results were evaluated with the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). A real case study in the Daning River watershed, Three Gorges Reservoir Region, China, was evaluated. The results indicated that rainfall data scarcity during low flow periods would result in poorer model performance and larger prediction uncertainty, especially to some minimum values, and the time when the maximum values are more susceptible is the rainfall data scarcity during high flow periods. The repair of rainfall data and the H/NPS model performance obtained by the EMB algorithm are superior to the traditional DA and weather generator performances. This advantage of the EMB algorithm would be more definitive if a specific threshold of data scarcity is reached. It is noted that even if the best algorithm is used, the imputed value is always lower than the peak observed value. This paper reports important implications for the choice of imputation methods and the use of H/NPS models for solving data scarcity problems for watershed studies.

AB This paper presents a new laboratory method to simultaneously estimate K-s and a and n parameters of the van Genuchten (1980) theta(h) from the inverse analysis of an upward infiltration curve measured in a 5-cm high soil column. The method was evaluated on synthetic 1D infiltration curves generated for a theoretical loamy sand, loam and clay soil. The influence of the soil initial condition on the inverse analysis was also studied. Next, an optimization method was presented and tested on eight theoretical soils (from loamy sand to clay). The method was subsequently applied to experimental curves measured on five sieved soils (from sand to clay) packed in 5-cm high and diameter cylinders. The K-s, alpha and n values estimated from the inverse analysis of the experimental curves were compared to those measured by Darcy and the pressure cell method (PC). The initial soil tension, h(i), which had an important influence on the optimization, was fixed to - 6.0.10(5) cm. The optimization method resulted robust and allowed accurate estimates of the actual hydraulic parameters. A close to one relationship (R-2 = 0.99) was observed between the theoretical a and n and the corresponding values obtained with the inverse analysis. Regarding to the experimental soils, significant relationships close to one were obtained between K-s and n (R-2 > 0.98) estimated from inverse analysis and those measured with Darcy and PC. A nonsignificant relationship with slope away from one was found for alpha.

AB Developing hydrologic models based on data-driven approaches (DDA) is very complicated due to the complex nature of meteorological data. For example, a high degree of irregularities, periodicities, jumps, and other forms of stochastic behavior influence the accuracy of river flow forecasting. In this study, M5 model tree (M5Tree) and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) models were developed to forecast one and multi-day-ahead river flow. Moreover, ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), a robust data pre-processing technique, was used to enhance M5Tree and MARS models' forecasting. Also, Mallows' coefficient (C-p), one of the procedures to determine the input variables, was used to obtain the optimum values of hydrological time series. The developed models were validated using two different meteorological stations (e.g., Kordkheyl in Iran and Hongcheon in South Korea).
   Forecasting performance of developed models (e.g., M5Tree, MARS, EEMD-M5Tree, and EEMD-MARS) was evaluated using six different statistical criteria. Comparing the results between standalone and hybrid models indicated that a data pre-processing technique can enhance the performance of standalone models (e.g., M5Tree and MARS). EEMD-MARS model (NSE = 0.819 and RMSE = 7.206 m(3)/s (Kordkheyl station) and NSE = 0.738 and RMSE = 50.426 m(3)/s (Hongcheon station)) outperformed M5Tree, MARS, and EEMD-M5Tree models based on two-day-ahead river flow forecasting in validation stage, respectively. Results showed that EEMD-MARS model was an efficient and robust tool to forecast one and multi-day-ahead (e.g., two, three, and four-day-ahead) river flow.

AB Accurate precipitation estimates are essential for reliable hydrological simulations of fluxes and states. Satellite precipitation products have been widely used for hydrological applications, especially for ungauged regions. The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) product is starting to provide a new generation of precipitation estimates. This work first evaluates several GPM Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals (IMERG) against gauge-based precipitation over Mainland China for a two-year period (2016-2017), and then explores the feasibility of using GPM to force a lumped hydrological model over 300 catchments of varying size and climate.
   The analysis indicates that IMERG Final run estimates (gauge-adjusted) agree well with gauge-based precipitation at daily scale, while IMERG Early run estimates (near-real time without gauge adjustments) are consistently lower than the rain gauge records. Nevertheless, both Final run and Early run estimates are slightly better than TRMM 3B42 estimates in terms of rainfall detection skill. Moreover, all three products show better skill over humid regions than over high elevation zones.
   When used as hydrological model forcing, IMERG Final and Early estimates provide comparable performances to gauge-based precipitation. However, TRMM 3B42 performs relatively poor in terms of hydrological simulation. Moreover, models generally perform better in humid than in arid areas for all three products. The evaluation sheds light on how IMERG-driven hydrological predictions perform in different regions across China. The findings also indicate the potential of IMERG Early run for flood forecasting and Final run for climatological/hydrological modeling in ungauged or poorly gauged basins.

AB In identifying groundwater contaminant sources, given that the simulation model is computationally inefficient, an ensemble surrogate model is proposed to improve the accuracy and robustness of results. The proposed ensemble surrogate model in this paper consists of the following three individual surrogate models: Kriging, radial basis functions and least squares support vector machines. The Adaptive Metropolis-Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is used to assign weights to the three models. Accuracy and robustness of the ensemble surrogate model were tested on not only conservative contaminants but also contaminants containing chemical reaction. The results indicated that the proposed ensemble surrogate model is an effective method to solve the inverse contaminant source identification problems with a high degree of accuracy and short computation time.

TI A field investigation on ephemeral gully erosion processes under

AB Ephemeral gullies (EGs) are important erosion features that could account for as much as 70% of total erosion on the Loess Plateau of China. However, few quantitative studies have been conducted in the field on the impact and mechanism of upslope sediment runoff in EG erosion processes. A series of field rainfall simulation experiments were conducted on an artificial EG to investigate the impacts of upslope inflow with two flow rates (15 and 30 L min(-1)) and five sediment concentrations (20, 40, 80, 120, and 160 g L-1) on runoff and erosion processes within the EG. The results showed that the lower flow rate of 15 L min(-1) increased soil loss by 26% compared with the higher inflow rate (30 L min(-1)). The lower inflow rate triggered greater sheet or rill erosion, whereas the higher rate mainly strengthened the incision of the main EG channel and led to increasing gully erosion. The channel shoulders expanded laterally very little, especially under the higher flow rate. Inflow sediment concentration had a major influence on EG erosion processes. With increasing sediment concentration, EG erosion and total slope erosion first increased, and then decreased. When sediment concentration exceeded 120 g L-1, the inflow sediment began to be deposited, and 120 g L-1 can be regarded as a critical value of EG erosion. These results are beneficial to establish a soil erosion model and to control ephemeral gully erosion in loess areas.

AB Limestone, dolomite, gypsum, anhydrite, and salt are rocks, which can be dissolved, either by water alone, or in the case of limestone and dolomite more efficiently by water enriched with carbon dioxide. With time, the secondary porosity in these rocks increases substantially, and flow through these soluble rocks becomes very effective and fast. The time period for a substantial increase in secondary porosity ranges from years (salt) to 10,000-100,000 years (limestone, dolomite).
   The temporal evolution of such a soluble rock can be described by numerical models, coupling flow, transport, and dissolution. On the fracture-scale, numerous models describe fingering and wormhole formation in soluble rocks. On the aquifer-scale, numerical models predict preferential flow patterns and a strong exchange-flow component.
   We present results from three-dimensional numerical models describing the evolution of a karst aquifer in its early stage. Our numerical approach, which describes the large aquifer-scale, is capable to simulate the strongly heterogeneous development of secondary permeability in the aquifer. Based on irregularities in the model (e.g. geometry, chemistry, lithology, hydrology), preferential pathways evolve under a catchment-control situation, limiting the inflow into the system through the amount of water available from a catchment. We compare qualitatively our large aquifer-scale results to small fracture-scale results and show that the fingering described by the latter models is driven by similar mechanisms as the preferential growth in the former models.

AB A flood hazard is one of the most common and destructive natural disasters. Flood risk reduction with non-engineering measures has become the primary goal for flood management. This paper proposes an approach to improve the flood control operation for cascade reservoirs by minimizing flood control risk. A framework of reservoir flood control operation coupled with risk assessment (RFCORA) and the corresponding RFCORA model are proposed to reduce risk. The model contains three sub-modules. A real-time reservoir flood control operation simulation module is developed, in which a flood discharge control chart is used to determine the flood magnitude, and flood release is obtained by operation rules. Entropy-weighted fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is applied to assess the risk level in the flood risk assessment module. Finally, the flood release is updated according to the developed outflow adjustment optimization module aimed at minimizing flood control risk by combing future inflow information. In addition, another model without outflow adjustment optimization is set to be a comparative experiment. The water system of the Upper Yellow River is selected as a case study to verify the model. The results show that the framework and RFCORA model developed in this paper can decrease the time duration in the highest risk level without increasing the maximum water level and maximum outflow of reservoirs. The approach proposed in this paper based on flood control operation and flood risk assessment can be extended to flood mitigation in other water systems in similar situations.

AB Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is a variable of great importance for several purposes, such as hydrological studies and irrigation scheduling. The FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (FAO-56 PM) equation is recommended to estimate ETo a given its good accuracy. However, the estimation of ETo poses a challenge when the availability of meteorological data is limited since the FAO-56 PM equation requires data on temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and wind speed. This study evaluates, for the first time, the performance of alternative equations, artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM), for the estimation of daily ETo across the entirety of Brazil using measured data on temperature and relative humidity or only temperature. Two strategies, not yet used in Brazil, were used to develop the ANN and SVM models: (i) the definition of groups of weather stations with similar climatic characteristics, using the K-means clustering algorithm, to develop models specific for each group; and (ii) the addition of previous meteorological data as input for the models. Data from 203 weather stations distributed across Brazil were used. The ANN and SVM models showed higher performances than the equations that were studied, even when they were calibrated. The evaluated strategies (clustering and previous days) provided considerable performance gains. For the temperature-based models, the best performance was obtained by the ANN developed with the strategy of clustering and the use of data from two previous days as input; however, due to the similar performance and greater generalization capacity, the ANN developed without clustering and with the use of data from four previous days is recommended. For the temperature- and relative humidity-based models, the ANN developed with data from four previous days was the best option.

AB Floods are one of the most devastating natural disasters, especially in the midstream plain area of the Huaihe River Basin (HRB) in China, where it is densely populated. This region has suffered from serious backwater flood problems due to its topography and geomorphology. Additional storage space is critical for this region in order to control flood. The middle reach of the Huaihe River is a coal-rich region. The large subsidence areas caused by coal mining may help reduce the issue of insufficient flood storage space, and therefore evaluation of the flood storage capacity in the subsidence areas becomes necessary. A distributed coupled surface water - groundwater model, MODCYCLE, was redeveloped to simulate the interaction between the rivers, the water in the subsidence areas and groundwater. The model was used to simulate maximum flood storage capacity in the subsidence areas and the ability to reduce flood peaks. Two scenarios were created for land subsidence conditions in 2010 and 2030 where typical flood events in 2003 were used. It is revealed that for the 2010 scenario, there was flood overflow even with the maximum storage space used, whereas for the 2030 scenario, the subsidence areas could completely contain the flood water, and therefore eliminate the backwater flood problem. Compared with the 2010 subsidence scenario, the water levels in the depressions can also be significantly reduced in the 2030 subsidence scenario. Our results, from an integrated hydrological modeling's perspective, suggest that using the subsidence areas caused by coal mining for flood storage has the potential to alleviate the problem of backwater flood in the study area, and in the meantime provides an alternative management approach for handling the subsidence areas.

AB Data of open water evaporation (E-ow), such as evaporation of lake and reservoir, have been widely used in hydraulic and hydrological engineering projects, and water resources planning and management in agriculture, forestry and ecology. Because of the low-cost and maneuverability, measuring the evaporation of a pan has been widely regarded as a reliable approach to estimate E-ow through multiplying an appropriate pan coefficient (K-p). K-p is affected by geometry and materials of a pan, and complex surrounding environment variables. However, the relationship between K-p and different environment variables is unknown. Thus, this study chose China D20 pan as an example, used meteorological observations from 767 stations and introduced the latest PenPan model to analyze the sensitivity of K-p to different environment variables. The results show that, the distribution of annual K-p had a strong spatial gradient. For all the stations, annual K-p ranged from 0.31 to 0.89, and decreased gradually from southeast to northwest. The sensitivity analysis shows that for China as a whole, K-p was most sensitive to relative humidity, followed by air temperature, wind speed and sunshine duration. For 767 stations in China, K-p was most sensitive to relative humidity for almost all the stations. For stations north of Yellow River, wind speed and sunshine duration were the next sensitive variables; while for stations south of Yellow River, air temperature was the next sensitive variable. The method introduced in this study could benefit estimating and predicting K-p under future changing environment.

AB Proven in situ treatment and remediation approaches are limited for low-permeability aquifers materials, particularly because of limitations to the delivery of reactive chemicals or access to contaminated plumes. In this paper, we describe the development of a cutting-edge solution for the remediation of contaminated groundwater in a low-permeability and low water-bearing aquifer contaminated with the chlorinated hydrocarbon trichloroethylene (TCE). The remediation technique introduced coupling of large-diameter permeable reactive barrier wells (PRB wells) with: (1) extraction wells through in a highly impacted plume; and (2) re-injection wells at the fringe of the plume. A pump-and-treat system (PTS) was employed at the site in a separate plume to reduce the mass of TCE near the second source zone. This research focuses only on the large diameter PRB well system. Conceptual site model development, design considerations, implementation and performance evaluation demonstrated how each of these elements were applied in the field. Approaches for coupling technologies to increase technical and economic feasibility are presented. Extraction and reinjection wells of treated groundwater at the fringe of the plume promoted a positive hydraulic gradient, facilitated groundwater transport through the reactive media, and contained the plume. Detailed geospatial and statistical analysis with over 10 years' monitoring data showed that dissolved TCE plume delineation shrank, and still concentration continues to decline, and were projected to meet the demands of remediation compliance regulations in the next few years.

AB The anticipation of flash flood events is crucial to issue warnings to mitigate their impact. This work presents a comparison of two early warning systems for real-time flash flood hazard forecasting at regional scale. The two systems are based in a gridded drainage network and they use weather radar precipitation inputs to assess the hazard level in different points of the study area, considering the return period (in years) as the indicator of the flash flood hazard. The essential difference between the systems is that one is a rainfall-based system (ERICHA), using the upstream basin-aggregated rainfall as the variable to determine the hazard level, while the other (Flood-PROOFS) is a system based on a distributed rainfall-runoff model to compute the streamflows at pixel scale. The comparison has been done for three rainfall events in the autumn of 2014 that resulted in severe flooding in the Liguria region (Northwest of Italy). The results obtained by the two systems show many similarities, particularly for larger catchments and for large return periods (extreme floods).

   Effect of different uncertainty sources

   distribution; Uncertainty assessment
ID PERFORMANCE; CALIBRATION; RAINFALL
AB Flood estimates needed for designing efficient and cost-effective flood protection structures are usually derived using observed peak discharges. This approach neglects, firstly, that floods are characterized not only by peak discharge but also by flood volume, and, secondly, that these characteristics are subject to modifications under climate and land use changes. Bivariate flood frequency analysis based on simulated discharge time series makes it possible to consider both flood peak and flood volume in design flood estimation. Further, this approach considers changes in discharge characteristics by using discharge series generated from climate time series used as an input for a hydrological model. Such series are usually not available at an hourly resolution but at a certain aggregation level (e.g. 24 h) and might not perfectly represent observed precipitation distributions. In this study, we therefore investigate how the aggregation and distribution of precipitation series and discharge distribution affect flood peaks and volumes and their dependence. We propose a framework for assessing the uncertainty in bivariate design flood estimates that is caused by different factors in the modeling chain, which consists of precipitation-discharge modeling, flood event sampling, and bivariate flood frequency analysis. The uncertainty sources addressed are precipitation aggregation and distribution, parameter and model uncertainty, and discharge resolution. Our results show that all of these uncertainty sources are relevant for design flood estimation and that the importance of the individual uncertainty sources is catchment dependent. Our results also demonstrate that substantial uncertainty is introduced already in the first step of the model chain because commonly used calibration procedures do not take into account the reproduction of flood volumes. Researchers should be aware of such deficiencies when performing bivariate flood frequency analysis on modeled discharge time series and should aim to tailor model calibration procedures to the problem at hand.

AB The interaction between the different components of the water cycle at ecosystem scale is of great interest in hydroecology. Stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in the water molecule can be used to study these processes quantitatively due to their different physical properties. This study aims at quantifying the contribution of local moisture sources to the isotopic signature of water vapor in the specific estuary system of a coastal lagoon. Here we present a framework of the isotopic composition of the atmospheric water cycle components (water vapor and precipitation) for the coastal lagoon of Venice (Italy) and we discuss the interaction between the atmospheric component and the surface component of the local water cycle, i.e. the atmospheric moisture and the lagoon water. The Venetian Lagoon is an enclosed basin with low freshwater influx, resulting in the presence of large horizontal gradients of the isotopic composition of surface water. This feature allows to determine the sensitivity of the isotopic signal in near surface atmospheric moisture under a range of humidity conditions. We observed that when the lower atmosphere is close to water vapor saturation pressure condition, the isotopic composition of water vapor at the ground appears to be in isotopic equilibrium with lagoon surface water in a range of approximately 6-26 km from the sampling point. On the other hand, under unsaturated conditions, we estimated that lagoon evaporation flux accounts on average for similar to 27% to the daily (06-18 Local Sidereal Time) total evapotranspiration surface flux. This is the first study that discusses the spatio-temporal variability of water vapor, precipitation and surface water isotopic composition for a coastal lagoon, thus including the major components of the local water cycle in an estuarine system with the isotope approach.

AB The Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming supplies about 40 percent of coal in the United States. In recent decades, coalbed methane (CBM) extracted from coal beds has become an important source of energy in the United States and other countries. CBM water is the produced water brought to the surface as a byproduct of gas extraction. The use of CBM water from the Powder River Basin for irrigation is limited by its relatively high sodium adsorption ratio so the water has to be maintained in lined retention ponds. The liners can be detached from the pond bed, breached through normal weathering or from extreme weather events, and can wear out with time. Water level changes due to constant and dynamic evaporation and precipitation of rainfalls and snowfalls and refilling by gas companies. The objectives of this study are: (1) to develop and validate a novel uniformness based multi-component algorithm to quantify the areas of water and exposed (not submerged in water) liners of the retention ponds from regular red-green-blue (RGB) images, and (2) to quantify the areas of water and liners of the CBM retention ponds in the Powder River Basin using high-resolution true-color images such as free Google Earth imagery. The multi-component algorithm is composed of a sequence of processes: georeferencing, denoising, RGB to L* a* b* color space transformation, K-mean clustering analysis, intelligent identification of connected component in each class, extraction of water body based on maximum uniformness, extraction of exposed lined zones based on uniformness or least root-mean-square value of RGB, and eventually calculation of water area and exposed line area. Application of the multi-component algorithm to the CBM retention ponds in the Powder River Basin using high-resolution true-color images shows that the algorithm can extract accurately water area and the exposed area of liners from these images of high spatial resolution (0.20 similar to 0.34 m), providing a useful tool to use regular RGB images as a resource for monitoring reservoirs, lakes or artificial small ponds.

AB Intermediate water disturbance (in the form of overflow of surface water and changes in the depth of groundwater) may help to accelerate restoration of degraded riparian forest ecosystems in extremely arid areas and enhance the resistance of those ecosystems to drought. To test this possibility, we selected the lower reaches of the Tarim River in China to analyse monitoring data on vegetation and hydrology spanning a 16-year period, and a 100-year data record of tree rings in Populus euphratica. The results suggested that ecological water conveyance can restore degraded desert riparian forest ecosystems. In the early stages of restoration, the interval between two overflows should not be longer than 3 years. Intermediate disturbance (1-2 overflows a year, each lasting 21-30 days) proved conducive to the formation of a plant community that is both diverse and stable, thereby supporting the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Both P. euphratica and Tamarix chinensis adopt suitable strategies for using groundwater from different depths to adapt to drought. Based on these results, appropriate disturbance modes related to both surface water and groundwater are proposed for the restoration and conservation of desert riparian forest ecosystems under varying intensities of drought. These modes offer scientific guidance on more efficient use of water and on ecosystem management in similar areas around the world.

AB Transpiration (Tr) is influenced by environmental factors, vegetation properties, and anthropogenic management. The effect of environmental factors on Tr are taking place from two aspects: evaporative demand (i.e., potential evapotranspiration, PET) and water supply (i.e., soil water). Soil water is one of the most important factors that limit plant transpiration in terrestrial ecosystems, especially in semi-arid and arid regions. Investigating the relationship between Tr and soil water is crucial for an improved understanding of plant survival strategies and predicting hydrological cycles and water resources under climate change. Although the relationships of soil water and Tr have been widely studied, the independent effects of soil water on Tr are difficult to separate because soil water and PET occur concurrently under natural conditions. This study carried out field observations of sapflow density, meteorological factors and soil water in a black locust (Roblin:a pseudoacacia) plantation in the semi-arid Loess Plateau of China. This information was used to develop a model integrating the daily PET and relative extractable soil water (REW, an index that represents the available soil water): Tr = (0.27 x PET - 0.02 x PET2 - 0.32) x (1 - e(-5.70 x) (REW)). The model fitted the measured data well (R-2 = 0.65 and RMSE = 0.06 mm day(-1)). We found that the daily Tr increased as the REW increased under varying PET levels. Additionally, the independent effects of soil water on Tr were analysed using the factorial experiment analysis method. The REW was manipulated and PET varied naturally during the measurements to separate the independent effects of the REW on Tr. The results showed that Tr increased with the REW during the study period at a rate of 0.53 mm day(-1) per 0.1 REW when the REW < 0.4 and 0.09 mm day(-1) per 0.1 REW beyond the threshold (REW = 0.4). Tr increased by 27.3 mm (43.7%) compared to the controlled Tr (observed PET and lowest REW) due to the effects of increasing REW (ranging from 0.14 similar to 0.81) during the study period (growing seasons of 2015 and 2016). Furthermore, canopy-level stomatal conductance was calculated using a simplified inverted Penman-Monteith equation. The reference canopy-level stomatal conductance (Gsref), which represents the Gs capacity and its sensitivity to soil water, showed an increasing response with increasing REW, which is the possible reason for the Tr dynamics with the REW. Our study provided an improved understanding of the soil water-Tr relationship and predicted effects of climate change on tree water use. Although the method required abundant field observation data, we have provided a feasible method of accurately quantifying the independent contribution of soil water on forest Tr.
