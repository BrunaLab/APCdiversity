AB OBJECTIVE: The present study assessed the most common types of lead failures, identified the causes, and discussed the potential procedures for revision surgery after vagus nerve stimulator implantation in patients with epilepsy.
   METHODS: In a retrospective study during an 8-year period, 13 patients had undergone revision surgery because of lead failure. Lead failure was classified as either lead intrinsic damage or lead pin disengagement from the generator header. On the radiographic image, we defined a rear lead connector (RC) ratio that represented the portion of the rear lead connector in the header receptacle. It was used to quantitatively evaluate the mechanical failure of the lead-header interface. The optimal procedures to identify and manage lead failure were established.
   RESULTS: All 13 patients presented with high lead impedance of >= 9 kOhms at the time of revision. Of 10 patients with lead damage, 7 had presented with an increased seizure frequency after a period of seizure remission. In contrast to lead damage occurring relatively late (>15 months), lead pin disengagement was usually found within the early months after device implantation. A significant association was found between an elevated RC ratio (>= 35%) and lead pin disengagement. The microsurgical technique permitted removal or replacement of the lead without adverse effects.
   CONCLUSIONS: The method of measuring the RC ratio developed in the present study is feasible for identifying lead disengagement at the generator level. Lead revision was an effective and safe procedure for patients experiencing lead failure.

AB The different types of soil macropores (e.g., biopores and non-biopores) vary in the conductivity of water or air due to the difference in the 3D pore characteristics. The objectives of this study were to reveal which types of macropores and which macropore characteristics played the most important roles in regulating water or air flow. Intact soil columns sampled from the subsoil of a long-term fertilization experiment were scanned by medical X-ray computed tomography (CT), and subsequently, saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) and air permeability at -12 cm water potential (K-a12) were measured. The 3D characteristics of macropores were then analyzed with image analysis. The biopores and the percolating biopores that connected the top and the bottom of a soil column were separated for the biopore-dominated samples (with percolating biopores) and their 3D characteristics were also quantified. Our results showed that the mean macropore diameter of the limiting layer (MDLL) presented the best relationships with K(s )and K-a12 compared with the other macropore characteristics for all the samples. The biopores and percolating biopores contributed 27.8-74.5% and 3.26-64.4% of the volume of total macropores, respectively, for the biopore-dominated samples. The hydraulic radius, mean diameter, compactness, global and local connectivities, and MDLL of biopores, especially those of percolating biopores, were generally larger than those of total macropores. The global connectivity (Gamma) of biopores performed very well for estimating K(s )and K-a12. The MDLL of percolating biopores could predict K-s much better than the MDLL of biopores and total macropores. Moreover, the performance of MDLL for estimating K-a12 was as good as the MDLL of biopores but was much better than the MDLL of total macropores. The findings of this study reveal that the MDLL is a more useful parameter in estimating saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability at low water potential than the other CT-derived pore characteristics.

AB Climate change coupled with the current trend in rapid urbanization is increasing the risk of flooding that can cause loss of life and damage to property. Adapting to climate change impacts and flood mitigation has become a life critical factor as well as a severe challenge. Green infrastructure and low impact development methods are common approaches that are increasingly used to address stormwater management in developed environments. The analysis and results of this study show that AMC/IC does impact flood response even in urban developed catchments and that it can significantly impact flood responses during storm events. We show that considering AMC/ICs coupled with changes in seasonal rainfall patterns that are projected for warmer climates in the future can modulate some of the increases in flood risk due to climate change.
   The prevailing thought is that Antecedent Moisture Conditions (AMCs) have little to no relevance in urban hydrology, particularly in relation to climate change. However, current trends in use of stormwater management methods that depend on local storage and infiltration is increasingly making AMC or Initial Conditions (IC) a factor in urban flooding. Despite this trend there is little available literature that discuss the aspect of AMC/IC that can have an implication on urban flood management. Here, we move towards filling this gap in current literature related to impacts of AMCs in flooding of developed areas by focusing on how possible changes in seasonal rainfall patterns in a warming climate might impact AMC and starting conditions in stormwater Best Management Practices (SWBMPs), and how those changed initial conditions impact flood risk in developed areas. Using a comprehensive hydrologic/hydraulic model of an urban/developed catchment and continuous simulation, we demonstrate the importance of accurately accounting for initial conditions in flood assessments. We consider average summer temperatures based on approximately 70 years of historic data to select warm and cold years. We compare the model results between the warm and cold years as a proxy to look at trends related to a future warming climate.

AB Surface area is an important input parameter for reactive transport modelling and it changes with time when rocks dissolve. Here we show direct observations of increased surface area due to chalk (predominantly CaCO3) dissolution, using 3D in situ X-ray microtomography. This transient increase cannot be explained by changes in fluid accessibility or by surface roughening that arises from preferential leaching. We use model simulations to explain how this increase in surface area correlates with the size of the Damkohler space, defined macroscopically using a phenomenological dissolution rate law and the cumulative surface of the microstructure. We attribute this transient increase to the coupling between fluid flow and mineral dissolution and argue that the extent is determined by the advective penetration distance of the reactants. We conclude that using a macroscopic dimensionless number as a qualitative indicator for microstructure evolution has limited applicability.

AB Scale represents an important concept in all scientific disciplines, but the scaling effect related to non-point source (NPS) pollution simulation and sensitivity parameters has not yet been reported. In this study, the sliding window, the Fourier amplitude sensitivity test and the nested watershed idea were used with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to explore the temporal and spatial scaling effects of parameter sensitivity in a typical watershed of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region, China. The results indicated that a great scaling effect could be observed at varying spatio-temporal scales, while the scaling effect would be transferred and amplified from the hydrological modelling to the NPS simulation. Soil properties such as SOL_K and SOL_BD were identified as key parameters under smaller spatial and temporal scales, while channel-related parameters in terms of ALPHA_BF, CH_K and CH_N showed greater sensitivity at larger scales. Specifically, some parameters, such as CH N, USLE_K, USLE_P and ERORGP, were always identified as key sensitive parameters for the sediment and NPS-TP simulations, but some parameters, such as CH_K, showed sensitivity only above a specific spatial scale (778 km(2) in this study). These results could be used as a reference for studying the scaling effect of model parameter sensitivity and provide important information for model construction and the management of NPS pollution at different scales.

AB Accurate long-term estimates of precipitation at fine spatiotemporal resolution are vital for several applications ranging from hydrometeorology to climatology. The availability of a good network of rain gauges, and high precipitation variability associated with two annual monsoon systems and complex topography make India a suitable test-bed to assess the performance of any satellite-based precipitation product This study assesses the performance of latest versions of four multi-satellite precipitation products: (i) Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), (ii) Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), (iii) SM2RAIN-Climate Change Initiative (SM2RAIN-CCI), and (iv) TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) across India using gauge-based observations for the period of 1998-2015 at monthly scale. These four multi-satellite precipitation products are essentially based on different algorithms and input data sets. Among these multi-satellite precipitation products, SM2RAIN-CCI is the only product that does not use rain gauge observations for bias adjustment. Results indicate that CHIRPS and TMPA are comparable to gauge-based precipitation estimates at all-India and sub-regional scales followed by MSWEP estimates. However, SM2RAIN-CCI largely underestimates precipitation across the country as compared to gauge-based observations. The systematic error component in SM2RAIN-CCI dominates as compared to random error component, which suggests the need of a suitable bias correction to SM2RAIN-CCI before integrating it in any application. The overall results indicate that CHIRPS data set could be used for long-term precipitation analyses with rather higher confidence.

AB In recent years, thermal infrared (TIR) cameras have improved in resolution and accuracy while their cost has declined. By deploying a ground-based TIR camera to collect time-lapse images, it is now possible to acquire high-resolution stream temperatures through both space and time. However, while ground-based TIR is useful for qualitatively identifying stream temperature differences, acquisition of absolute stream temperatures remains difficult due to interference from reflected radiation. Therefore, improved correction approaches are still needed to extract absolute stream temperatures from ground-based, time-lapse TIR imagery. Using > 1100 TIR images acquired every 10 minutes during two field seasons, we assess two methods for correcting time-lapse, ground-based TIR stream temperature data: (1) an analytical method derived from the literature that corrects for atmospheric transmissivity, reflected temperatures and water surface emissivity, which did not improve TIR temperature accuracy, and (2) an empirical approach that uses an offset correction created from in-stream control point temperatures, which reduced the mean absolute temperature difference between the TIR and insitu stream temperatures. Examination of the analytical method revealed its sensitivity to reflected temperatures from the surrounding environment, a problem that is particularly pronounced in ground-based TIR imagery due to the lower stream emissivity at more oblique viewing angles. Since reflected temperatures and stream surface emissivity can be difficult to quantify and are misrepresented in previous hydrologic literature, the empirical correction approach offers an alternative method for extracting absolute stream temperatures from ground-based TIR imagery affected by these factors.

In this study, we hypothesized the intensity and uncertainty of runoff and sediment events as the ecological function of soil erosion by using structural equation modeling (SEM), and integrated observed influencing factors to represent the ecological structure of soil erosion. We further assessed the interactions of ecological structures and functions in four typical patch covers containing bare patch (B type), Andropogon patch (G type), Artemisia coparia patch (H type) and Spiraea pubescens patch (J type) in the Loess Plateau over three rainy seasons. We found that (1) the highest and lowest probabilities of runoff (approaching to 0.37 and 0.22) and sediment (approaching to 0.27 and 0.03) events were in B and J types respectively. B type produced the highest runoff coefficients (0.004) and yielded 2-3 times more sediment than other three vegetation patch covers. (2) Antecedent soil moisture and crown width were two relative more crucial indicators to simultaneously affect the uncertainty and intensity of soil erosion in different patch cover patterns. (3) Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity connected the soil and plant latent variables to indicate the complexity of ecological structure. (4) The measurement error of sediment yield became the main source of system error of the soil erosion assessment by SEM. These results suggest that the uncertainty of runoff and sediment event was an important descriptor to improve the interpretation of ecological function of soil erosion. The logistic regression and SEM form a new analysis framework to explore the interaction between ecological structure and function of soil erosion. This framework could enhance the understanding of erosion processes, and be beneficial to managing the restoration vegetation and utilizing the available water and soil resources in semiarid environment.

AB Stream-bank erosion in the alluvial channel is a matter of great concern particularly for the irretrievable loss of fertile land. This in effect has direct impact on the agriculture, environment, economy and social issues at large. A series of laboratory experiments were carry out to study the turbulence structure over eroded bank topography. Modulation of mean, turbulent flow characteristics and the benefaction of turbulent bursting structures to the total Reynolds shear stress due to the changed geometry of the eroded bank wall are described for three different clay fraction variations. A side looking micro-acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) was used to record the detailed high frequency velocity data near the bank wall to understand the coupled dynamics of flow and erosion on sediment-water interface. The information on clay and fine sand content of natural river bank was obtained from field observation. Results from the present study indicate that higher turbulence intensities and Reynolds shear stress have prominent role in the removal of bank materials from the bank wall and continues the dislodgement of material from the bank face until mass failure. Quadrant analysis to the random velocity fluctuation in the vicinity of eroded stream-bank shows that downstream bank material movement is strongly correlated to the presence of sweep events. Probability density function (PDF), kinetic energy fluxes and coefficients of skewness and kurtosis of velocity fluctuations show significant changes with the change in clay fraction of the bank material composition. Though the velocity spectral densities are in general observed to be similar for all the three different bank undercut depths for different clay fraction of bank; however, spectral energy shows signature of higher energy peak for lower clay fraction of the bank material.

AB The wind forcing effects on mixing dynamics and circulation can drive important bio-hydrodynamic interactions in certain regions of a hydraulically dominated river-lake floodplain system. Poyang Lake, connected with the Yangtze River, is an example of such a system. The wind forcing effects on Poyang Lake have not been assessed in detail. In this study, a hydrodynamic model and a current energy method were used to investigate the hydrodynamic pattern forced by the combination of hydraulic and wind drivers and to distinguish both forcings. Two prevailing wind directions (NNE and SSW) with 3 wind-speed (3 m/s, 5 m/s and 10 m/s) scenarios, including tracer transport and residence time, were further simulated to determine the wind effects. The results showed that there are distinct hydraulic-dominated and wind-dominated regions. In the three wind-dominated zones, various circulation patterns were determined by the wind direction and complex geometry, and current speeds were positively correlated with the wind speed magnitude, regardless of wind direction. However, residence times responded differently to wind forcings. The low-speed NNE wind forcing was found to be the most disadvantageous for mixing and dispersion and was prone to allowing material enrichment in the eastern sub-lakes. An improved understanding of ecological behaviour in local zones of Poyang Lake is provided to guide future water management.

AB Owing to hydrological change and human activities, increasing attention is being paid to the evolution of dependence structure of hydrological characteristics, especially for non-stationary multivariate frequency analysis. In this study, we performed a non-stationary frequency analysis of annual extreme rainfall of four study regions in eastern coastal China. Two indexes separately accounting for rainfall volume and intensity were derived from daily precipitation data recorded by four pairs of gauges. In particular, based on the compatibility of data sets examined by the copula equality test, index series sharing similar dependence structures were merged to enrich data bases for copula modelling. A moving time window of 30 years was applied to the index series for non-stationarity analysis. An investigation of dependence evolution was conducted by detecting trends and change-points in the correlation coefficient series. Time-dependent Archimedean copulas and Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution were employed to model the joint and marginal distributions, respectively. Kendall's return period was employed to compute the design values of the indexes. Results showed an intensifying tendency of extreme rainfall volume and/or intensity in three of the study regions and uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation. Finally, the occurrence risk of annual extreme rainfall corresponding to different joint return periods (JRPs) was analyzed based on the observed index series. The study highlights incorporating non-stationarity in multivariate hydrological analysis and merging compatible data sets to improve copula inference.

AB Changes in the patterns of regional economic and social development will affect regional agricultural and industrial structures, thereby affecting grain cultivation patterns. Imbalances between the grain supply and demand will trigger interregional grain flow. Grain is a water-intensive product, and virtual water embedded in grain products flows between regions, which will affect the utilization and distribution of regional water resources. This study evaluated the impacts of socio-economic factors on regional grain virtual water flows by using the partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM). Results show that grain production centers in China are being transferred to the northern regions due to the evolution of economic patterns over the past 30 years. Driven by the imbalance between the regional grain supply and demand, the virtual water flow patterns of grain shows a tendency to flow from the northern and western provinces to the southern and eastern provinces. Results of structural equation modeling show that there is a significant causal structure between socio-economic factors and grain virtual water flows. The study indicates that the regional socio-economic pattern and its evolution will affect the grain virtual flow patterns. Consequently, virtual water flows will exert great pressure on water resources in the virtual water export areas, and the expansion of the virtual water export will increase the difficulty of regional water resources systems in supporting regional social and economic sustainable development and grain production, thus posing a potential challenge to China's water resources and grain security.

AB Extreme climate events such as severe droughts and floods have become more frequent and widespread in the 21st Century. Recent studies have revealed the tele-connections between Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and extreme precipitation over different regions such as South America, India and China. This study investigates the influence of MJO on global extreme dry and wet conditions, and how the strength of the relationship changes across the MJO phases over the globe. The Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) calculated from global GLEAM evapotranspiration dataset is used to represent extreme dry and wet conditions. Strong correlations between MJO and extreme dry and wet conditions are found, particularly over monsoon regions such as South Asia, South America and East Africa. The underlying mechanism of the influence of MJO on extreme dry and wet conditions is associated with the variation of precipitation, air temperature and soil moisture modulated by the MJO. The study suggests that MJO impacts on extreme dry and wet conditions should be taken into account in investigation of droughts/floods around the world particularly over monsoon areas.

AB Understanding the time that water takes to traverse the vadose zone is important to quantify groundwater recharge rates and to assess the vulnerability of aquifers to contamination. Tritium mass balance models provide measurement-driven estimates of soil water velocities, yet uncertainties embedded in these groundwater recharge estimates are rarely investigated. Here we analyze six > 15-m tritium profiles collected from thick unsaturated zones located on China's Loess Plateau and compare recharge rates obtained from various calculation approaches. Models used to estimate recharge based on unsaturated zone data include the tritium peak method and the tritium storage method; models used to estimate recharge using saturated zone data include the 'modern groundwater' method and a method that assumes groundwater is well-mixed in the aquifer. The tritium peak method presents reliable recharge; however, the recharge from the tritium storage method is two times of that from the tritium peak method. The well-mixed reservoir method overestimates groundwater renewal rates because the implicit assumption that groundwater is well-mixed in aquifers is not realistic. For potential recharge, considerable uncertainties arise from precipitation tritium reconstruction; while for actual recharge estimation, uncertainties come from the mismatched recharge mechanism between the model assumption and local characteristics. Selection of appropriate tritium mass balance models is of utmost importance for recharge estimation.

AB In this study we use polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) to perform uncertainty analysis for seawater intrusion (SWI) in fractured coastal aquifers (FCAs) which is simulated using the coupled discrete fracture network (DFN) and variable-density flow (VDF) models. The DFN-VDF model requires detailed discontinuous analysis of the fractures. In real field applications, these characteristics are usually uncertain which may have a major effect on the predictive capability of the model. Thus, we perform global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to provide a preliminary assessment on how these uncertainties can affect the model outputs. As our conceptual model, we consider fractured configurations of the Henry Problem which is widely used to understand SWI processes. A finite element DFN-VDF model is developed in the framework of COMSOL Multiphysics (R). We examine the uncertainty of several SWI metrics and salinity distribution due to the incomplete knowledge of fracture characteristics. PCE is used as a surrogate model to reduce the computational burden. A new sparse PCE technique is used to allow for high polynomial orders at low computational cost. The Sobol' indices (SIs) are used as sensitivity measures to identify the key variables driving the model outputs uncertainties. The proposed GSA methodology based on PCE and SIs is useful for identifying the source of uncertainties on the model outputs with an affordable computational cost and an acceptable accuracy. It shows that fracture hydraulic conductivity is the first source of uncertainty on the salinity distribution. The imperfect knowledge of fracture location and density affects mainly the toe position and the total flux of saltwater entering the aquifer. Marginal effects based on the PCE are used to understand the effects of fracture characteristics on SWI. The findings provide a technical support for monitoring, controlling and preventing SWI in FCAs.

AB The use of stable isotopes from precipitation as tracers in unconsolidated porous media can be limited due to attenuation in the unsaturated zone, yet this process has been poorly constrained in fractured rock. The complexities of fractured rock systems necessitate the use of multi-level monitoring wells for the measurement of isotopic tracers with depth. These methods, however, are rarely employed in groundwater flow and recharge studies, particularly involving temporal isotope measurements in multiple rock types. To understand the attenuation of isotopic snowmelt tracers in fractured rock and explore surface connections and recharge, an investigation was undertaken at three geologically-distinct field sites in south-eastern Ontario, Canada. Results of constant head injection tests at 2-m intervals were used to identify and isolate high transmissivity zones (2-3 in each well) for the construction of eight multi-level wells (22 intervals) used for groundwater sampling. Deuterium and oxygen-18 were measured in rain (n = 64), snow (n = 67), soil water (n = 118) and groundwater (n = 594) on a bi-weekly to monthly basis over two seasonal snowmelt cycles ( > 1.5 years). In combination with stable isotopes, measurements of hydraulic head, groundwater temperature, specific conductance and two rounds of tritium sampling contributed to the development of a conceptual model for snowmelt recharge and flow in sandstone, limestone and crystalline rock. Seasonal variation of delta H-2 and delta O-18 was observed in all rock types indicating recent recharge and strong surface connections. The dampening and residence time of the snowmelt tracer increased with depth in crystalline rock. Tracer attenuation was highest in higher-porosity sedimentary rock and strong confining conditions were observed to inhibit recent recharge. Substantial isotopic attenuation measured in the overburden indicated that the strong snowmelt signal measured in groundwater stemmed from water infiltrating through areas with thin or no overburden. Identification of the periodic trends and distinct isotopic horizons in this study would not have been possible without the use of multi-level wells.

AB Rationalized water use has become increasingly important in recent years, due to deficient rain distribution and increased water demands, such as in forestry and agricultural production. Evapotranspiration is an important variable of the hydrological cycle and one of the main components of the hydrological balance in the soil. The use of simplified equations is a potential alternative to estimate reference evapotranspiration (ET0) when meteorological data is limited. The objective of this study was to apply and test different methods to estimate reference evapotranspiration with limitations on meteorological data in the state of Espirito Santo, using the Hargreaves and Samani method under different meteorological conditions, adopting the Penman-Monteith FAO56 as a reference. ET0 was calibrated using the Hargreaves and Samani equation with different adjustments by linear regression, considering all the weather stations used in this study (general adjustment), different climate types (adjustment by climate), by dry and rainy season (dry and rainy season adjustments), thermal amplitude class (adjustment by class) and climate type combined with thermal amplitude class (adjustment by climate and class). ET0 was also estimated for the aims of comparison, using the Hargreaves and Samani original (HS) and Penman-Monteith with limitation of climatic data (PML). In increasing order of efficiency, quantified by the average absolute error (MAE, mm day(-1)), the methods to estimate evapotranspiration with limitation of meteorological data were: PML (1.46); original HS equation (0.68); general adjustment of ET(0)estimated by the HS equation (0.53) adjustment by thermal amplitude class (0.51); adjustment by climate type (0.51); adjustment for rainy or dry season (0.51); and adjustment by climate and class (0.49). The adjustment by climate and thermal amplitude class provided better ET0 estimates, especially on days with higher evaporative demand on air (greater evapotranspiration), when better evapotranspiration estimates for diverse applications were necessary.

ID 1ST FLUSH; URBAN RUNOFF; DISCHARGES; NITROGEN
AB This paper investigates the residual nutrient load from a combined sewer system along the shore of a deep Italian lake, to provide data that can help explaining the contribution of combined sewers to lakes eutrophication. To this purpose, a stochastic methodology is applied to the analysis of the combined sewer overflows and pollutants, that provides reliable estimates, with related uncertainties, of the storage capacity to be supplied in order to mitigate the impact on the quality of receiving waters. The sewer is modeled by SWMM and two terminal combined sewer weirs are modeled in detail and instrumented for calibration purposes. A year-long campaign was accomplished, allowing to study the occurrence and relevance of the first flush. The calibrated model of the sewer network was used to extrapolate the results to a 10-years period, thus providing a statistically reliable estimate of the residual load delivered from this watershed to the lake. A conservative evaluation shows that up to 22% of phosphorus and up to 41% of nitrogen delivered to the sewer are still discharged into the environment. However, the results also show that in this case a relatively small capture volume would obtain a target pollution reduction, thus providing insights on the feasibility of this structural practice in similar watersheds along the shore of endangered lakes.

AB Existent algorithms to train adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) such as gradient descent and least-square methods are useful, but they have problems such as trapping in local optimum as well as high-volume of computations. This paper examines the application of genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimization for the continuous domain (ACO(R)), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE) for improving the performance of ANFIS models in simulating monthly rainfall magnitudes. Monthly rainfall records of nine foothills to arid weather stations of Isfahan province, central Iran were used for evaluating the proposed methodology. The correlation coefficient and non-linear sensitivity analysis were performed on the available rainfall records. Monthly rainfall modelling was carried out based on three input groups and used separately in five applied models (e.g. ANFIS, ANFIS-PSO, ANFIS-ACO R , ANFIS-DE, and ANFIS-GA). The obtained results showed that proposed hybrid models had better accuracy than the simple ANFIS model in escaping local optima. The best model was ANFIS-ACO R (with R-2 = 0.92, RMSE = 2.73 mm and SI = 0.26), while sole ANFIS model (with R-2 = 0.33, RMSE = 9.98 mm and SI = 0.90) presented the worst output. Moreover, the obtained results showed that: (1) Coupling the optimization algorithms with ANFIS can improve its performance in modeling the monthly rainfall time series; (2) the correlation coefficient and sensitivity analysis of input data provided a valid input selection that could improve the model accuracy with neglecting the redundant input parameters.

AB Knowledge of the spatial distribution of water isotopes in the large river system is useful to comprehend the hydrological processes within the basin. Spatially limited water isotope data in the Ganga river basin (GRB), one of the largest river basins in the world, hinders the understanding of hydrological processes at the basin scale. Therefore to understand the hydrological processes, river water and ground water were collected from the source (Gangotri glacier) to sink (Bay of Bengal) of the river Ganga. The delta O-18 values of river water vary from -14.9%o to - 6.3%o with a general enrichment in O-18 from source to sink. The delta O-18 values of ground water are similar to river water only in the middle stretch of the river, indicating higher mixing of these two water sources in the middle stretch. Comparison of the monthly averaged (three years) delta O-18 values of river water and rain water suggests that temporal variability in the isotopic composition of river water is higher in the middle stretch of the river compared to lower stretch due to lower discharge in the middle stretch. To understand the spatial variability of delta O-18 values in the GRB, delta O-18 values of river water were modeled using latitude and elevation as primary predictors. The residuals of the model suggest that in the upper stretch snow/glacier melt control the delta O-18 values, in the lower stretch Himalayan tributaries control the isotopic composition of the river water and in the middle stretch evaporation dominates which is also supported by delta O-18-delta D plots of the different water inventories.

AB Hydrologists and hydrogeologists both study the flux and storage of water with the numerous interactions and feedback mechanisms of surface water and groundwater. Traditionally however, focus, models and scales of the studies differ. In this commentary, situations are illustrated where boundary conditions that each discipline assumes, preserves and actively uses, can and have to be overcome. These situations occur when the domain of one discipline cannot be separated from the other one because of existing interaction and feedback mechanisms at the boundaries. Highlighted are especially these boundary conditions, where closer collaboration between catchment hydrologists and hydrogeologists would be most useful. Often such collaborations would be relatively straight-forward and rather requiring an increased awareness than novel methods.

TI The adoption rate of efficient irrigation practices and the consequences

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

AB The rate of adoption of efficient irrigation practices influences the return on investment from those practices and affects how much, and even whether, aquifer conservation occurs. A spatial-dynamic programming model for an agricultural landscape indicates that as the rate of adoption increases, the return on investment gradually decreases as groundwater levels rise in Eastern Arkansas, USA. The model results also show that slow adoption can increase aquifer depletion because there is a switch to irrigation intensive crops, but fast adoption can conserve the aquifer because a larger proportion of the crops use less irrigation water. Even the fastest adoption rate should not dissuade future adoption because the return on investment in the efficient irrigation practices remains high. At low adoption rates, a subsidy of efficient irrigation practices for the least irrigation intensive crop is almost as cost-effective for groundwater conservation as a tax on well pumping. At high adoption rates, only a tax on well pumping is very cost-effective.

AB Hydrogeological flow and transport strongly depend on the connectivity of subsurface properties. Uncertainty concerning the underlying geological setting, due to a lack of field data and prior knowledge, calls for an evaluation of alternative geological conceptual models. To reduce the computational costs associated with inversions (parameter estimation for a given conceptual model), it is beneficial to rank and discard unlikely conceptual models prior to inversion. Here, we demonstrate an approach based on a quantitative comparison of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) sections obtained from field data with corresponding simulation results arising from various geological scenarios. The comparison is based on three global distance measures related to wavelet decomposition, multiple-point histograms, and connectivity that capture geometrical characteristics of geophysical reflection images. Using field data from the Tagliamento braided river system, Italy, we demonstrate that seven out of nine considered geological scenarios can be discarded as they produce GPR sections that are incompatible with those observed in the field. The retained scenarios reproduce important features such as cross-stratified deposits and irregular property interfaces. The most convenient distance measure of those considered is the one based on wavelet-decomposition. Direct analysis of the distances is the most intuitive and fastest way to compare scenarios.

AB A first-order moment analysis is developed to investigate the temporal and spatial propagation of uncertainty of slope stability during rainfall, considering spatial variabilities in initial soil water pressure and soil hydraulic properties, and temporal variability of rainfall. Results of the analysis indicate that the uncertainties resulting from variabilities in initial soil pore water pressure distributions and rainfalls are comparable with that from the variability in soil hydraulic properties. Further, the evolution of slope stability uncertainty is driven by the mean flow field, and a localized large-uncertainty zone along the slope profile could form, leading to a localized low-reliability zone, which may lead to the failure of the slope. In particular, when the slope is close to saturation, the reliability of the stability analysis of any elevation of the slope is low even at early rainfall times. On the other hand, when the slope is unsaturated and heavy rainfalls occur, the low-reliability zone exists at shallow parts of the slope at early times. The results also show that greater unreliability exists at shallow depths at early times when the rainfall has a descending trend in comparison with uniform and increasing trend. Lastly, the low-reliability zone is always near the impermeable bedrock if rainfall persists.

AB ( )Proper soil hydraulic functions of the water retention curve (the WRC) and relative hydraulic conductivity (the RHC) are essential for studies of unsaturated groundwater flow in soils. Various mathematical expressions of these functions have been proposed, including the widely used van Genuchten-Mualem model combining the van Genuchten formula for the WRC and the Mualem formula for the RHC. Here we validate a model based on the van Genuchten function for the both WRC and RHC (termed the MVG model), against published experimental data covering a wide range of soil textures from sand to silt clay loam. The results show that the MVG model is more accurate and flexible than existing soil hydraulic functions, especially for predicting the RHC. The fitting of the model to the data also reveals a relationship of model parameters between the MVG-WRC and MVG-RHC functions. Both functions can be integrated and differentiated to attain simple analytical expressions for characteristic parameters of soil water flow, for example, the wetting front pressure psi(f) used in the Green and Ampt model for ponded infiltration analysis and the characteristic length L-c as a key factor in determining various flow processes (e.g., drainage or evaporation) in unsaturated soils.

AB There are different trend identification methodologies in the literature, but almost all are for monotonic trend searches within a given hydro-meteorological time series partially at equal epochs or holistically over the whole record duration. The most important question is how to identify within the same time series successive trends of different durations and slopes. For this purpose, successive arithmetic average methodology (SAM) is proposed in this paper, first for a set of trends visual inspection and then their quantitative duration and slope calculations. This method provides to identify peak and valley change-points years, trends durations and slopes. The most significant benefit from SAM is that there is no need for preliminary assumptions and trends identifications are straight forward. The only limitation of the method is short length time series. Absolute relative percentage error control is suggested as +/- 10% for separation of successive partial trend differences. The application of SAM methodology is presented for more than seventy-year duration total annual rainfall records from seven geographic and climate regions in Turkey. It has been calculated that both increasing and decreasing trend durations have at the maximum 4.5-year duration. According to the calculations, except at one meteorology station almost all the trend slopes are negative, which may be an initial signal for climate change impact indicating the rainfall decreases in recent years over Turkey.

AB Soil moisture is a core ecohydrological element in the middle-high latitude frozen area, which occupies approximately 30% of the global land area. The Sanjiang Plain, an important commercial grain production area, is the largest swampy low plain in a middle-high latitude frozen area in China. However, no published studies on this region have clarified the accuracy of soil moisture data from in-situ measurements; the performance of ecohydrological models are also unknown. In this study, we compared the ability of the SMAP product, a RSDTVGM model, and two self-erected soil moisture monitoring stations to capture soil moisture information in the Sanjiang Plain by using the Triple Collocation method. Soil moisture data were collected for 642 continuous days, and the data period was divided into three frozen periods (FT) and two non-frozen (NFT) periods. Valid data supply rates of the three methods were also calculated and compared. From the Triple Collocation method, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the SMAP, model and in-situ monitoring data sets were 0.03, 0.08, and 0.05. The valid data supply rates of the SMAP product in the FT and NFT periods were 27.1% and 57.5%, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the SMAP product and the in-situ monitoring dataset was 0.301 for the FT period and 0.557 for the NFT period. The RS-DTVGM model had a data supply rate of 100%. The Pearson correlation coefficient for this model was 0.101 for the FT period, but reached 0.726 for the NFT period. For the three soil moisture data sets, the accuracy ranking in this middle-high latitude area was SMAP > in-situ monitoring > model simulation. Although neither SMAP nor the RS-DTVGM model could capture the real soil moisture information for the FT period, both could accurately simulate the soil moisture in the NFT period. The results from the RS-DTVGM model demonstrated a closer relationship with in-situ soil moisture measurement data relative to the SMAP method. The in-situ method provided accurate soil moisture data, but its application is limited by high cost. In the future, the data from the three methods should be assimilated together to measure soil moisture data with high accuracy and high spatial and temporal resolution in this important area.

AB Climate change is likely to stimulate variations in phytoplankton composition and production in gradually eutrophicating water, with negative consequences for the water quality of many reservoirs. This study analyzed the effects of climate warming and increased nutrient loading on algae communities recorded by sedimentary pigments in the Changtan Reservoir of southeastern China from 1985 to 2015. Pigment profiles indicated that cyanobacteria, green algae, diatoms, and cryptophytes were the dominant algae groups during the study period. Algae biomass increased significantly after 2007, correlated (by the Mann-Kendall test) with an upswing in nutrient load and rising air temperatures. Generalized additive model (GAM) analysis demonstrated that total phosphorous was the dominant contributor to algae biomass during the study period, accounting for 41.37%, 43.86%, 58.91%, 97.36%, and 70.24% of variations in total algae, cyanobacteria, green algae, diatom, and cryptophyte biomass, respectively. The relative contributions of annual average air temperature to variations in total algae, cyanobacteria, green algae, diatom, and cryptophyte biomass were 10.80%, 14.02%, 14.13%, 24.64%, and 17.31%, respectively, depending strongly on nutrient load. In conclusion, climate warming and increasing anthropogenic nutrient loading forced phytoplankton dynamics and drove increasing algae biomass in this reservoir, suggesting that future water quality management practices should consider both meteorological and anthropogenic factors affecting algae communities.

AB Agricultural nonpoint source (ANPS) pollution has become a major reason for eutrophication in many regions of the world. However, it is still difficult to identify the relative contributions of different ANPSs to the nutrient export flux at the watershed outlet due to a lack of effective methods. The export coefficient approach (ECA) and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which is a process-based watershed simulation model with aquatic nutrient retention simulation modules, were implemented to identify the ANPS and its associated quantitative contributions in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region, China. By using the SWAT-ECA framework, nutrient loadings to the river reaches in the subbasin and the export flux at the outlet of the watershed, which were derived from individual agricultural sources in each subbasin, were quantified accordingly. The primary goal of this study is to quantify the pollutant loads from different agricultural sources by using SWAT-ECA. The proposed work was conducted in the Xiangxi River Watershed of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region, Hubei Province, China. The total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loads that were generated from the agricultural sources were 1299.1 t a(-1) and 97.4 t a(-1), respectively. Livestock production was the main source of the TN load, accounting for 82% of agricultural TN load. Livestock production and crop cultivation were the main sources of the TP load, accounting for 52% and 42%, respectively. The delivery ratios of N and P from the source areas to the watershed outlet were relatively high in the study watershed. TN (1234 t a(-1)) and TP (87.1 t a(-1)) from agricultural sources were ultimately released to the reservoir area, which accounted for 40.2% and 37.6%, respectively, of the total fluxes from the whole watershed. The comprehensive approach that is proposed in this study can be useful for identifying the contributions of individual agricultural sources to the nutrient export flux at the watershed outlet.

AB Water stable isotope signatures can provide valuable insights into the catchment internal runoff processes. However, the ability of the water isotope data to constrain the internal apportionments of runoff components in hydrological models for glacierized basins is not well understood. This study developed an approach to simultaneously model the water stable isotopic compositions and runoff processes in a glacierized basin in Central Asia. The fractionation and mixing processes of water stable isotopes in and from the various water sources were integrated into a glacio-hydrological model. The model parameters were calibrated on discharge, snow cover and glacier mass balance data, and additionally isotopic composition of streamflow. We investigated the value of water isotopic compositions for the calibration of model parameters, in comparison to calibration methods without using such measurements. Results indicate that: (1) The proposed isotope-hydrological integrated modeling approach was able to reproduce the isotopic composition of streamflow, and improved the model performance in the evaluation period; (2) Involving water isotopic composition for model calibration reduced the model parameter uncertainty, and helped to reduce the uncertainty in the quantification of runoff components; (3) The isotope-hydrological integrated modeling approach quantified the contributions of runoff components comparably to a three-component tracer-based end-member mixing analysis method for summer peak flows, and required less water tracer data. Our findings demonstrate the value of water isotopic compositions to improve the quantification of runoff components using hydrological models in glacierized basins.

AB Karst aquifers are dynamic hydrologic systems which can be sensitive to short-term recharge events (storms) and heterogeneous recharge characteristics (point recharge at sinks, irregular soil thicknesses). In this study, two adjacent karst springs, Tippery Spring and Near Tippery Spring, were monitored to better understand flow and source mixing characteristics in response to two storms in May and June 2017. Monitoring techniques included high-resolution discharge and temperature logging and collection of spring water using automatic samplers to analyze chemical parameters such as stable water isotopes and Mg/Ca ratios along with Ca/Zr ratios and rare earth elements (REEs) which have had limited testing in karst systems. The two springs exhibited behaviors which were both unique to each spring and shared depending on which parameter is considered. Spring-specific behaviors included discharge and isotopic response, with Tippery Spring having a flashier and faster conduit flow behavior relative to Near Tippery Spring's delayed storm response. Absolute Mg/Ca values were spring-specific, owing to the relative fraction of limestone and dolostone in their respective recharge areas, although both springs showed similar Mg/Ca ratio shifts after storms. While Ca/Zr ratios changed in timing and intensity with storm intensity, both springs exhibited a decline in Ca/Zr ratios as calcium-rich carbonate matrix water was displaced by zirconium-rich storm recharge water from sinking streams off the clastic upland ridges. Flushing of recharged storm water resulted in an increase in total REE concentrations at both springs (from < 0.15 ppb to > 1.0 ppb), with the timing and magnitude of concentration increases determined by the degree of surface connectivity intrinsic to each spring and the intensity of the recharge event. REEs and Ca/Zr ratios provided additional and complementary tracer techniques to better understand transient recharge and flow behaviors in karst springs.

AB Multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs generally need to adjust operational functions for different storage levels; most existing reservoir schemes lack the pertinence to model the complex behaviors of such reservoirs. This paper proposes an improved operation-based reservoir scheme to simulate the storage and outflow variations for multiyear and multipurpose reservoirs at a daily time step. In this improved reservoir scheme, the new parametric functions to represent the weights of the outflow through considering various operation purposes (e.g., hydropower generation, flood control, and water supply) are introduced. Then, the improved reservoir scheme is integrated into a macroscale hydrological model, i.e., Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. In this study, the performance of the proposed reservoir scheme is evaluated with the observed storage and outflow of a multiyear and multipurpose reservoir (Xinfengjiang Reservoir) in South China and compared to two other reservoir schemes (i.e., a multilinear regression reservoir scheme and an operation-based reservoir scheme). In addition, through uncertainty analysis, this study shows that the time-varying operation-based parameters can reflect the changes of reservoir storage but not reservoir outflow, indicating that the parameters for establishing functional relationships need further exploration. Results reveal that the proposed reservoir scheme has a wide applicability for reservoir storage and outflow simulation, especially for the reservoirs with limited reservoir management data.

AB In this research study, a fuzzy multi-objective optimization methodology is proposed for in-situ groundwater bioremediation utilizing the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution. In the current model, uncertainties in hydraulic conductivity and the ratio of transverse to longitudinal dispersivity of contaminants are considered using the Fuzzy Transformation Method (FTM). First, the BIOPLUME III simulation model is linked with a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) multi-objective optimization model to optimize a groundwater bioremediation system regarding conflicting viewpoints of decision makers. Then, the hydrogeological uncertainties of the groundwater bioremediation system are included in the proposed methodology using FTM. The three main objectives of the in-situ bioremediation optimization model are overall cost (well installation, treatment or pumping, and facility capital), the sum of contaminant concentration violating any standards, and contaminant plume fragmentation, which need to be minimized based on stakeholders' preferences. Subsequently, GMCR II is utilized to resolve any conflicts between the perspectives of the stakeholders to achieve a compromise solution. The performance assessment results represent the ability of the proposed methodology for optimal in-situ groundwater bioremediation. Results show that the minimum fuzzy interval is 323%, and pertains to the overall cost of the bioremediation system in fuzzy alpha-cut levels of 0 and 0.5. Conversely, the maximum fuzzy interval is related to contaminant plume fragmentation in fuzzy alpha-cut levels of 0 and 03, and was found to be 95.1%.

AB Soil degradation by water is a serious environmental problem worldwide, with specific climatic factors being the major causes. We investigated the relationships between synoptic atmospheric patterns (i.e. weather types, WI's) and runoff, erosion and sediment yield throughout the Mediterranean basin by analyzing a large database of natural rainfall events at 68 research sites in 9 countries. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to identify spatial relationships of the different WTs including three hydro-sedimentary variables: rainfall, runoff, and sediment yield (SY, used to refer to both soil erosion measured at plot scale and sediment yield registered at catchment scale). The results indicated 4 spatial classes of rainfall and runoff: (a) northern sites dependent on North (N) and North West (NW) flows; (b) eastern sites dependent on E and NE flows; (c) southern sites dependent on S and SE flows; and, finally, (d) western sites dependent on W and SW flows. Conversely, three spatial classes are identified for SY characterized by: (a) N and NE flows in northern sites (b) E flows in eastern sites, and (c) W and SW flows in western sites. Most of the rainfall, runoff and SY occurred during a small number of daily events, and just a few WTs accounted for large percentages of the total. Our results confirm that characterization by WT improves understanding of the general conditions under which runoff and SY occur, and provides useful information for understanding the spatial variability of runoff, and SY throughout the Mediterranean basin. The approach used here could be useful to aid of the design of regional water management and soil conservation measures.

AB Rainfall is considered the hardest weather variable to forecast, and its cause-effect relationships often cannot be expressed in simple or complex mathematical forms. This study introduces a novel hybrid model to month ahead forecasting monthly rainfall amounts which is motivated to be used in semi-arid basins. The new approach, called MPSA-MGGP, is based on integrating multi-period simulated annealing (MPSA) optimizer with multigene genetic programming (MGGP) symbolic regression so that the hybrid model reflects the periodic patterns in rainfall time series into a Pareto-optimal multigene forecasting equation. The model was trained and verified using observed rainfall at two meteorology stations located in north-west of Iran. The model accuracy was also cross-validated against two benchmarks: conventional genetic programming (GP) and MGGP. The results indicated that the proposed gene-annealing model provides slight to moderate decline in absolute error as well as noteworthy augment in Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency. Promising efficiency together with parsimonious structure endorse the proposed model to be used for monthly rainfall forecasting in practice, particularly in semiarid regions.

AB This study presents a three-dimensional discrete fracture network-fault (3D DFN-fault) model that contains a 3D DFN and a deformable 3D fault. The fault slip-induced shear displacement and normal displacement are taken into account. Under a constant normal stiffness (CNS) boundary condition, the normal displacement gives rise to an increase in the normal stress and a decrease in the aperture of the fractures connected to the fault, which are then incorporated into the model. Finally, a numerical code is developed to simulate fluid flow through the 3D DFN-fault model during shearing and the effects of the aperture heterogeneity, shear displacement and fracture structure on the hydraulic properties of fractured rock masses are estimated. The results show that an obvious channeling flow in the fracture networks is observed as remarkable localizations of the flow paths within limited areas of fracture planes. The aperture heterogeneity of fractures tends to hinder the overall flow through the DFN-fault model during shearing. The equivalent permeability decreases at the beginning of shear because of the stress-induced closure of fractures. With increasing the shear displacement, the equivalent permeability of the model in direction perpendicular to the fault slip direction either increases or decreases, depending on the competition of two effects: (i) the permeability is enhanced by the shear-induced dilation of the fault and the newly generated flow paths by connecting the dead-ends of fractures that are intersected to the fault; (ii) the permeability decreases due to the closure of fractures, which is influenced by the increase in the dilation-dependent normal stress. However, as the shear displacement continuously increases, the equivalent permeability in the direction parallel to the fault slip direction steadily increases.

AB This study used carbon (C) isotope sourcing to determine transport processes of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from the land surface to river catchments in Southwest China. Both nested karst watersheds investigated (Chenqi and Houzhai) are representative of typical karst landform environments (e.g., primary forest, secondary forest, and farmland). We measured DIC concentrations and the delta C-13 values of rainfall, river water, groundwater, soil, and plants. To do so, we used IsoSource (a Visual Basic program) to determine source partitioning over time (seasonal) and across the two nested watersheds. In 2017, the mean DIC concentration was 0.06 +/- 0.03 mmol L-1 and the rainfall delta C-13(DIC) value was -14.4 parts per thousand +/- 1.9 parts per thousand. We found similar DIC concentrations in the surface and groundwater of both watersheds, ranging from 0.20 to 0.71 mmol L-1 (seasonal) and from - 3.7 parts per thousand to - 9.4 parts per thousand (delta C-13(DIC)) in the Chenqi catchment and from 0.33 to 0.60 mmol L-1 (seasonal) and from -10.3 parts per thousand to - 6 parts per thousand (delta C-13(DIC)) in the Houzhai watershed. The average delta C-13 values of soil and local plants were - 24.6 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand and - 28.9 +/- 1.2 parts per thousand in the Chenqi catchment and -25.8 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand and - 27.2 +/- 1.8 parts per thousand in Houzhai watershed, respectively. In addition, carbonate bedrock and groundwater were the main sources of surface water in the Chenqi and Houzhai nested watersheds, both being greater than 30%. Source percentages were similar to 20% from atmospheric deposition and similar to 10% from soil. Furthermore, HCO3- was the predominant form of DIC (pH values > 8), and the contribution rates of dissolved carbonate minerals (HCO3-) were approximately 10.4% and 19.6% in the Chenqi catchment and the Houzhai watershed, respectively.

AB Dilution of sewage caused by extraneous water is believed to have a negative effect on the daily operation of the wastewater infrastructure. Ecological consequences arise due to an increased activity of combined sewer overflows (CSO) and to a decreasing efficiency of treatment processes, while the elevated pumping activity induces a proportional increase in operational cost. This work aims at putting these drawbacks into perspective by an in-depth investigation of several catchments for which detailed sewer and treatment plant models were set up to verify the effect of a virtual removal of the existing sewage dilution. Results showed that extraneous water is responsible for 5-35% higher CSO volume. Effects at the treatment plant seem less significant with small gains in treatment efficiency (2-4%). Energy savings (up to 5%) only marginally exceed the rise in sludge production cost assuming this extraneous water would be eliminated. Finally, a pragmatic approach towards strategies of removing dilution is suggested by the use of a decision tree.

AB Organic matter (OM) is widely accepted to be the trigger for arsenic (As) mobilization from sediments into groundwater. Identifications of reactivity and sources of organic matter responsible for driving As liberation remain unresolved. To address these issues, we provide the extensive characterization of OM in shallow groundwater, surface water, and sediments near a permanent wetland and a dried wetland in the Hetao basin with high As groundwater and low As groundwater, respectively, using fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Dissolved organic matter (DOM) of shallow groundwater and sediments near the permanent wetland had higher biological index (SIX), and more protein-like components and microbially-derived components relative to that near the dried wetland, showing higher bioreactivity. Fingerprint of water stable isotopes and higher water levels of wetland than shallow groundwater pointed to the recharge of wetland water into shallow groundwater. Laboratory incubations of the sediment with more bioreactive OM obtained near the permanent wetland mobilized more As. Both DOM properties and laboratory incubations indicate that OM with high bioreactivity promoted As mobility mainly by fuelling microbial respiration of Fe oxide reduction. Recharge of wetland water into shallow groundwater introduced bioreactive DOM into shallow aquifer. Groundwater DOM near the permanent wetland was typically sourced from both wetland DOM and sedimentary OM with high bioreactivity. However, sedimentary OM was the major source of groundwater DOM near the dried-wetland. It suggested that downward infiltration of surface-derived OM and perturbations of aquifer sediments by changing groundwater flow regimes increase bioreactivity of groundwater DOM and therefore enhance As mobility.

AB Eastern Arabian Peninsula represents the main natural groundwater discharge area of the Arabian platform fossil aquifer system. In such settings, connections between aquifers could strongly affect the flow dynamics, water quality and availability as well as karst formation and landscape evolution. Geological structures such as folds and faults are central to aquifer connectivity, yet their role on groundwater flow is poorly understood. Herein, we perform mapping of exposed and buried structural features in the Qatar Peninsula using Landsat, Sentinel-2 and ALOS-PaISAR scenes, correlated with field, GPR and isotopic data to assess their role in aquifer connections and groundwater dynamics. Our results suggest that ENE-WSW oriented fold-related faults act as vertical conduits along which artesian upward leakages from the deep Aruma aquifer take place into the shallower main aquifer unit (i.e. Umm er Radhuma and Rus) in southern Qatar Peninsula. On the other hand, downward leakage from the freshwater lens in the Dammam aquifer take place in northern Qatar Peninsula. The deep, brackish, and gaseous-rich waters ascending along faults in south Qatar Peninsula, in addition to degrading the water quality in the main aquifer unit, enhance dissolution of carbonates and evaporites leading to strong karstification that produces abundant collapse features. Our findings suggest that structure controls can add significant complexity to recharge mechanisms and groundwater dynamics in fossil aquifers. Future large-scale radar subsurface mapping will be essential to resolve the variability of the water heads in such areas and its correlation to structural discontinuities.

AB We consider the management of sloping, long and thin, coastal aquifers. We first develop a simple mathematical model, based on Darcy flow for porous media, which gives the water table height, and the flow velocity as a function of the underground seepage rate, the recharge rates and the extraction rates, neglecting sea water intrusion. We then validate the model with recent data from the Germasogeia aquifer which caters for most of the water demand in the area of Limassol, Cyprus. The data is provided over a three-year period by the Cyprus Water Development Department (WDD), the governmental department managing the aquifer. Three different models of the recharge sources have been considered and it was found that Gaussian sources give the closest agreement with data. Furthermore, based on our model, we subsequently develop an optimised recharge strategy and identify the optimal recharge rates for a desired extracted water volume while the water table height is maintained at the acceptable level. We study several scenarios of practical interest and we find that we can achieve considerable water savings, compared to the current empirical strategy followed by WDD. Additionally, we model the transport of pollutants in the aquifer in the case of accidental leakage, using an advection-diffusion equation and the concentration is determined in the aquifer for an ongoing contamination and two pulsed contaminations (pulse duration 1 day and 30 days, respectively). We find that in the case of an undetected and unhindered contamination (worst case scenario) the aquifer would get polluted in about three years. Also, we find that double recharge rates flush the pollutant out of the aquifer faster. Finally, to incorporate the possibility of sea water intrusion, which can render aquifers unusable, we develop a new, transient two-dimensional model of groundwater flow based on the Darcy-Brinkman equations, and determine the position of the water table and the seawater-freshwater interface for conditions of drought, moderate rainfall and flooding. The validation of the new seawater intrusion modelling approach has been carried out via comparison with a widely-accepted code.

AB Karstic aquifers are very sensitive and fragile to environmental changes. With more tunnels excavated in karst areas, groundwater levels are increasingly lowered and resulted in changed natural hydrogeological flow system and groundwater-dependent vegetation, soil and hydrology of surface water systems. Water, especially groundwater, is a limited and key factor and significant driving force for karst ecosystem processes. However, the effects of tunnels excavation on the ecosystems in karst areas remain largely unknown. This study aimed at investigating whether there were variations in soil water contents and shifts of plants water uptake patterns between rainy and dry seasons in a karst trough valley affected by tunnels excavation, and comparing their differences with those in a tunnel-free karst trough valley in southwest China. Monthly soil water contents at two soil layers of the upper 20 cm and lower 20-40 cm were measured, and soil water at two soil layers, subcutaneous water and plant (arbor and shrub) xylem water were sampled in February (mid dry season) and September (late rainy season) 2017, respectively, and the delta H-2 and delta O-18 of those waters were analyzed. The IsoSource model based on dual stable isotopes of delta H-2 and delta O-18 was used to estimate the contributions of different sources to the plant xylem water. Although the soil water contents at both valleys showed similar vertical and temporal variations resulted primarily from the evaporation and precipitation, the soil water contents of two soil layers in the tunneling affected valley were significantly lower than that of the tunnel-free valley at both seasons. Plants uptake water pattern changed from a dominant soil water source during the rainy season to a dominant subcutaneous water source during the dry season at both valleys. However, plants extracted more water from the subcutaneous zone in the tunneling affected karst trough valley than that of the tunnel-free karst trough valley at both seasons, of which the proportion of plants water uptake from the subcutaneous zone was 33% in rainy season and 76% in dry season, respectively, in the tunneling affected karst trough valley, while the proportion of plants water uptake from the subcutaneous zone was 24% in rainy season and 59% in dry season, respectively, in the tunnel-free karst trough valley. The above results indicated that tunnels excavation decreased the soil water contents and then changed plants water uptake patterns in karst areas.

AB Presence of vegetation in urban landscape influences soil temperature and soil moisture. Some studies in literature have focused on development of correlations between the above two parameters for agricultural fields and forest regions. These correlations could be dissimilar due to the differences in soil conditions (density and type), vegetation species and temperature between agricultural and urban landscape. This paper investigates the effects of vegetation on soil temperature and soil moisture by an integrated approach of field monitoring and numerical modelling. A simple hydrological model is developed to capture seasonal variations of surface soil temperature and its effect on root water uptake. Hypothesis of effects of soil temperature on root water uptake was investigated using field measurements of soil water content. Field site in urban landscape containing bare, grass and tree species were selected for investigation. There existed a contrasting trend in water content response between summer and autumn for both bare and vegetated soils. Due to higher evapotranspiration in summer, water content in vegetated soils were lower by up to 50%. However, water content in vegetated soil was found to be up to 70% higher than in a bare soil during autumn. It could be due to the lower soil temperature that inhibits root water uptake ability. This was verified using a series of numerical simulations that consider effects of soil temperature on root water uptake. Without considering soil temperature effects on root water uptake, there was an overestimation of reduction of soil water content by up to 50% in autumn period.

AB Aims: Tree sap flux density, as the basis for estimating forest transpiration, exhibits high spatiotemporal variation on hillslopes. This is largely due to the variation in the canopy leaf area index (LAI), potential evapotranspiration (PET), and volumetric soil moisture (VSM) that are induced by the slope position and shaded terrain effects. To improve the estimation of the daily sap flux density (J(s)) of sloped forests, a new approach is required that will extrapolate the J(s) measured at given slope position to other slope positions by considering both effects on the influencing factors.
   Method: This study was carried out on a southeast-facing hillslope of a Larix principis-rupprechtti plantation in NW China. The J(s) was monitored during the growing season of 2016 on three plots located at the foot-slope (FS), mid-slope (MS) and upper-slope (US). To exclude interferences from fluctuating weather conditions, only data from 16 sunny days were used. The dynamic optimal J(s) was applied to quantify the J(s) response to changes in the PET, LAI and VSM induced by the slope position and shaded terrain effects.
   Result: The mean daily J(s) (ml.cm(-2).min(-1)) of 16 sunny days differed among slope positions as MS (0.059) > FS (0.050) > US (0.041). The strong shaded terrain effect at FS was verified by the markedly delayed starting time of sap flow at the FS when compared to that at the US and MS under a weak shaded terrain effect. The strong shaded terrain effect at the FS induced a PET reduction which decreased with the rising DOY until the end of July and then increased, this effect at FS also induced an LAI reduction that varied with the DOY inversely to PET. The mean J(s) (ml.cm(-2).min(-1)) of 16 sunny days was reduced by 0.063 at US and 0.040 at MS mainly due to the slope position effect, and was reduced by 0.051 at the FS due to the joint impacts of a strong shaded terrain effect (0.0505) and a slope position effect (0.0005). When extrapolating the J(s) measured at the MS to estimate the J(s) at the US, the consideration of the slope position effect lowered the estimation error to 7.8% markedly decreased from 50.6% when not considering any effect. However, the J(s) estimation error at the FS increased from 25% to 87% when considering only the slope position effect, but decreased to 11.2% when considering both the shaded terrain effect and the slope position effect.
   Conclusion: The substantial spatiotemporal variation in J(s) exists on hillslopes due to the varying effects of the slope position and the shaded terrain. The rising slope position leads to a decrease of PET, LAI, VSM and consequently, J(s) while the strong shaded terrain effect at the lower slope (e.g., SF in this study) leads to a decrease in LAI, PET and J(s). Thus, it is necessary to consider the slope position and shaded terrain effects, as these variables can greatly improve the J(s) estimation accuracy when scaling up from measured values at one slope position to other slope positions and even the entire hillslope.

AB There is a need for the development of effective baselines against which the water quality impacts of industry in general, and shale gas extraction specifically, can be assessed. The salinity, and hence the specific conductance, of fluids associated with shale gas extraction is typically many times higher that of river water. The contrast between these two water types means that testing for salinity (specific conductance) could provide an ideal sentinel for detecting environmental impact of shale gas extraction. Here, Bayesian generalised linear modelling was used to predict specific conductance across English surface waters. The modelling used existing, spot-sampled data from 2005 to 2015 from 123 sites to assess whether this approach could predict variation for subsequent years or for a new site (data from 2002 to 2015). We show that the results were readily projected in to subsequent years for sites included in the initial analysis. The use of covariates (land-use, hydroclimatic and soil descriptors) did not prove useful in predicting specific conductance at further sites not previously included in the analysis. The extension of the approach to 6833 English river monitoring sites with 10 or more observations from more than one year over the period 2005-2015 showed that it was possible to reproduce the seasonal variation in river water specific conductance. The approach taken here shows that it is possible to use low-frequency but widespread monitoring data to predict natural variation at monitoring sites to give a probabilistic assessment of whether or not a pollution incident has occurred and the seasonal variation, expressed as uncertainty bounds around the observations, at a specific site has been exceeded.

AB This study unravels the controlling factors of concentration-discharge (C-Q) relations and solute export regimes of spring water based on long term monitoring of physicochemical parameters, radium and Rn-222. A simplified analytical solution is derived to quantify radium based mean transient time (MTT) based on radium disequilibrium. Key hydrogeological and lithological parameters such as retardation factor (R-f,R-Ra) and MTT of radium nuclides, and effective surface areas (S-e) of subsurface are therefore quantified based on the long term monitoring records and discussed with the C-Q relation and solute export regimes. The study leads to the findings: 1) The spring water is characterized by very short MTT (days to weeks). Lower MTT, higher effective surface areas and R-f,R-Ra are observed during the wet seasons than the dry seasons. 2) The slow mass transfer between immobile and mobile phases controls the solute exports of Cl-, Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+. Export regimes of theses solutes are negligibly influenced by dynamics of S-e and retardation processes. 3) Lower MIT, higher S-e and activation of NO3- and SO42- lead to higher concentrations of NO3- and SO42- in wet seasons, and vice versa in dry seasons. 4) SO42- export is additionally influenced by co-precipitation of sulphate precipitates. HCO3- is controlled by dynamics of CO2 dissolution caused by fluctuations of water temperature and water table. This study demonstrates that the disequilibrium of radium transport in the fractured aquifer can be deployed to investigate the metrics of the critical zone and the solute export regimes of a springshed.

AB The variations of DOC and DIC concentrations in lake ice and underlying waters were examined in 40 shallow lakes across the Songnen Plain, Northeast China. The lakes, frozen annually during winter, included freshwater and brackish systems (EC > 1000 mu S cm(-1) ; range: 171-12607 mu S cm(-1) in underlying water). Results showed that lake ice contained lower DOC (7.2 mg L-1) and DIC (6.7 mg L-1) concentration compared to the underlying waters (58.2 and 142.4 mg L-1, respectively). Large differences in DOC and DIC concentrations of underlying waters were also observed between freshwater (mean +/- SD: 22.3 +/- 11.5 mg L-1, 50.7 +/- 20.6 mg L-1) and brackish lakes (83.3 +/- 138.0 mg L-1, 247.0 +/- 410.5 mg L-1). A mass balance model was developed to describe the relative distribution of solutes and chemical attributes between ice and the underlying waters. Results showed that water depth and ice thickness were the key factors regulating the spatial distribution of solutes in the frozen lakes. Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficient at 320 nm, a(CDOM)(320) and specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)) were used to characterize CDOM composition and quality. Compared to the underlying waters, CDOM present in ice largely included low aromaticity organic substances, an outcome perhaps facilitated by ice formation and photo-degradation. In ice and underlying freshwaters, CDOM predominantly included organic C fractions of high aromaticity, while low aromaticity organic substances were observed for brackish lakes. Results of this study suggest that, if water salinity increases due to climate change and anthropogenic activities, significant changes can occur in the dissolved carbon and fate of CDOM in these shallow lakes.

AB The process of interrill erosion is complex by interaction of raindrop impact and sheet flow. Their relative contribution to interrill erosion is difficult to be evaluated even on bare soil. This study presents the new erosivity factor to evaluate the interrill erosion on steep vegetated hillslope with the more relevant understanding of the physical processes. The effective energy, the erosivity factor, is defined as the sum of the effective kinetic energy of rainfall and effective potential energy of surface runoff based on the energy balance. The effective kinetic energy of rainfall is determined by the horizontal component for slope of kinetic energy deducting energies dissipated by structure of vegetation canopies and a litter layer. The effective potential energy of surface runoff is equal to potential energy of the available surface water following rain-mass allocations of interception and infiltration. The data from experimental field plots with various vegetation coverage after wildfire were used to verify the effective energy equation. On densely vegetated slopes sediment yield depended greatly on effective kinetic energy of rainfall, while they from hillslopes having sparse coverage were dominated by effective potential energy of surface runoff. The dissipated energy due to interrill erosion showed the highest correlation coefficient with the effective energy under various cover conditions. The kinetic energy of raindrops was greatly reduced by the litter layer and the potential energy of rainwater decreased predominantly due to infiltration. The ratio of effective potential energy of surface runoff to total effective energy was the highest at 71.2% in the plots with low vegetation coverage. The energy efficiency for interrill erosion increased with decreasing vegetation coverage and reached maximum 1.35% in extreme rainfall event under low vegetation coverage. The constant and exponent of power-law functions between the effective energy and the soil erosion work were strongly correlated with gravel ratio and litter coverage, respectively. The results indicate that the effective energy is useful erosivity factor to evaluate the interrill erosion occurred by the complicated interaction of rain splash and sheet flow on vegetated hillslopes.

AB Storm water detention ponds are recognized as an effective type of treatment facility for urban storm water management purposes. This paper presents methodologies for the development of an analytical stochastic model describing the hydrologic operation of storm water quality control detention ponds with outflows controlled by orifices. The concept of effective storage capacity is proposed to properly represent a pond's storage in its stochastic water balance equation. The accuracy of the analytical stochastic model (ASM) is verified for many different hypothetical design cases. It is shown that the ASM for detention pond systems can provide accurate results for almost all possible design conditions. Implemented easily into a spreadsheet, the ASM provides an easy-to-use and computationally-efficient tool for analyzing the hydrologic performance of detention pond systems. The ASM can be used separately as a planning or design tool or together with continuous simulation models to help verify simulation results or reduce the number of simulation runs.

DE Mountain rivers; Channel storage; Volume deviation; Reservoir area;
   Hydraulic models
ID RIVER; SHALLOW
AB With the development and utilization of mountain rivers, modelers of rivers using one-dimensional (1D) hydraulic models face the challenge of selecting appropriate cross-section data for mountain rivers since previous studies have focused on alluvial rivers. Mountain rivers usually have larger bed slopes and smaller widths in comparison with alluvial rivers, which results in differences in their hydrologic processes. Our case study analyzes these differences using 1D models through the utilization of prismatic reaches with different gradient and width sizes and the provision of various boundary conditions. The influence of the size of these morphometric variables on the selection of optimal topographic data is related to the hydraulic problem at hand. In addition, mountain rivers tend to have more irregular cross sections and gradients than alluvial rivers because of their relatively erosion-resistant riverbeds. The effects of gradient deviation, width deviation and channel storage volume deviation on hydrologic process due to insufficient topographic data are compared. It is found that the influence of channel storage volume deviation, which is negligible in alluvial rivers, could be significant in mountain rivers. And the impact of width deviation is minimal in mountain rivers and alluvial rivers. Thus, in reservoir areas, measured width could be adjusted based on published stage-storage data to reduce channel storage volume deviation and improve flow simulation accuracy. This method is verified on a 605.71-km long reach in the Three Gorges Reservoir area.

AB In this paper, we study long-term coastal flood risk of Lingang New City, Shanghai, considering 100- and 1000-year coastal flood return periods, local seal-level rise projections, and long-term ground subsidence projections. TanDEM-X satellite data acquired in 2012 were used to generate a high-resolution topography map, and multi-sensor InSAR displacement time-series were used to obtain ground deformation rates between 2007 and 2017. Both data sets were then used to project ground deformation rates for the 2030s and 2050s. A 2-D flood inundation model (FloodMap-Inertial) was employed to predict coastal flood inundation for both scenarios. The results suggest that the sea-level rise, along with land subsidence, could result in minor but non-linear impacts on coastal inundation over time. The flood risk will primarily be determined by future exposure and vulnerability of population and property in the floodplain. Although the flood risk estimates show some uncertainties, particularly for long-term predictions, the methodology presented here could be applied to other coastal areas where sea level rise and land subsidence are evolving in the context of climate change and urbanization.

AB Freeze-thaw cycles are important processes relevant to terrestrial hydrological cycling. However, the representation of freeze-thaw cycles has been often simplified in large scale watershed models. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which has been widely used to understand and assess hydrologic budgets and water resources management, employs a simplified empirical approach to estimate soil temperature and determine the freezing and thawing status of soils. Here, we compared the performance of a physically-based soil temperature module and the built-in empirical approach in SWAT against field measurements at surface and 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 cm depths at six stations of the U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) within the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). In general, SWAT consistently underestimated winter soil temperatures and overestimated frozen days at all soil depths, while the modified version of SWAT (equipped with the physically-based soil temperature model; referred to as TSWAT) pronouncedly reduced the bias in estimated winter soil temperatures and frozen days compared with SWAT. Model performance assessment is conducted with three statistical coefficients, i.e., Bias (degrees C), the coefficient of determination (R-2), and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS). Statistical analyses show that TSWAT accurately simulated surface and soil temperatures at the five depths with R-2 and NS values greater than 0.82 at most sites, and Bias values were generally within the range of -1 to 1 degrees C during winter and ranged between - 2.09 and 2.58 degrees C in non-winter seasons. The differences in freeze-thaw cycle representation between SWAT and TSWAT translate into noticeable discrepancies in simulated key hydrologic variables, such as surface runoff, percolation, and baseflow. Compared against long-term observed streamflow (1980-2015), TSWAT outperformed SWAT in capturing variations in monthly streamflow in both winter and non-winter seasons. These results and analyses highlight the value of improving freeze-thaw cycle representation for enhanced hydrologic modeling in large watersheds that are subject to freeze-thaw cycles.

AB Experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of infiltration flux on air counterflow in a 2-dimensional (2-D) confined sand chamber. The air saturation distribution was monitored using light transmission and the air pressure was measured by manometers. As infiltration flux increased to 1000 mL/min and 1100 mL/min, significant increase in air pressure was observed. Due to the increase of air pressure, water infiltration was retarded, leading to a significant decrease in air outflow rate at high infiltration flux. When the infiltration flux was larger than 800 mL/min, the air flowed out of the sand chamber in the form of air "fingers". The underlying process of the finger-like air outflow pattern was analyzed quantitatively, and the critical infiltration flux leading to air "fingers" was estimated based on the relative air/water permeability of the working sand. The Green-Ampt model showed that the infiltration process was retarded by air counterflow when the air pressure head was comparable to the depth of the wetting front at high infiltration flux.

AB Exploring the effects of climate change on the hydrological response at the local scale requires climate data at high spatial and temporal resolutions. This is best achieved by generating downscaled ensembles of future climate variables derived from climate models. For this purpose we present a methodology to re-parameterize the AWE-GEN-2d model (Advanced WEather GENerator for a two-dimensional grid). The model simulates key meteorological variables needed by hydrological models and is particularly suitable to explore the effects of stochastic (natural) climatic uncertainty, which is fundamental for hydrological applications, especially at sub-kilometer and hourly scales. Factors of change for different climate statistics are calculated from climate model simulations of present and future climates and subsequently applied to the statistics derived from observations to re-parameterize AWE-GEN-2d. The model abilities in generating an ensemble of future climate variables for the transient period 2020-2089 is presented with examples of precipitation and near-surface air temperature fields from hourly to multi-annual scales for a small mountainous region in the Swiss Alps. The stochastic uncertainty is examined for present and future periods and for spatial scales from the RCM scale (12-km, daily) to 2-km demonstrating the potential use of AWE-GEN-2d outputs. At the RCM scale, model results yield a small increase in annual precipitation (4%) which is within the stochastic uncertainty range for present and future periods (7%). At the fine scale of 2-km, the increase in annual precipitation can exceed the stochastic uncertainty, but for less than 10% of the domain area. On the contrary, changes in annual near-surface air temperature exceed stochastic uncertainty both at the RCM and finer scales. Stochastic climate uncertainty was concluded to be very similar when comparing present and future periods and 12-km and 2-km scales. The benefits of using AWE-GEN-2d in hydrological climate change impact assessments are finally discussed.

AB The ecohydrological separation between soil water sources for plant water uptake and groundwater recharge has been recently examined in various climate zones primarily based on isotopic composition of water. The existence of the ecohydrological separation has profound implications for mechanistic ecohydrological modeling and water resource management. However, it is still unclear when and where the ecohydrological separation occurs, especially in humid regions. In this study, high frequency sampling of precipitation, bulk soil water, groundwater and twig xylem water for hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition measurement was conducted in a humid subtropical site in the central southern China from March 2017 to April 2018. We examined evidence of the ecohydrological separation with three methods (dual-isotope space, line-conditioned excess (lc-excess), and the piecewise isotope balance (PIB) method). The results show that the isotopic composition of plant xylem and bulk soil water are not distinguishable from those of precipitation water on the dual-isotope space due to a weak evaporation effect at the study site, indicating that there is no evidence of the ecohydrological separation. However, the other two methods support the ecohydrological separation in this humid area, with the results from the PIB method revealing more temporal details. The present study suggests that the ecohydrological separation can happen in subtropical humid climate. It is more likely to occur in spring and winter at the study site when plant-accessible water pool has been replenished by antecedent precipitation, while ecohydrological connection seems to occur during winter snowmelt. With the limitations of three methods, the caution should be taken when only one method is applied in examining the ecohydrological separation in such an environment.

AB Based on the principles underlying the calculation of the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), this study selects precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, sunshine hours, wind speed and runoff data to develop a multi-scalar drought index, the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration runoff index (SPERI), using methods such as Penman-Monteith and Copula. This index is applied along with the SPI and SPEI to Yunnan Province of China. The results show that the changes in the SPERI are close to those in the SPI and SPEI. They are well correlated and can all reflect drought conditions. In addition, comparisons among these three drought indexes and the actual extreme drought during September 2009-August 2010 showed that the SPERI was superior to the SPI and SPEI and that the 3-month SPERI assessment was the most accurate. Therefore, the SPERI can be used to analyze, assess and forecast drought conditions in different areas as well as to assess the impacts of climate change on drought.

AB Water stress can cause the structural and physiological changes of plants to prevent excessive water loss according to species-specific water use strategies. CO2 and water vapor fluxes were measured by the eddy covariance in a mixed plantation during a 4-year period. The potential evapotranspiration (PET) was obtained by the Shuttleworth-Wallace model. Evapotranspiration (ET) versus PET was used to determine the plant water stress index (PWSI). The objective of this study is to quantify the effect of PWSI on net ecosystem productivity (NEP), gross primary productivity (GPP) and water use efficiency (WUE). The relationship between PWSI and soil water content in sunny and cloudy skies was examined. Mean seasonal PWSI values varied substantially among years. The average annual value of PWSI was 0.49 +/- 0.07. PWSI was strongly correlated with vapor pressure deficit, illustrating that the moisture limitation through high evaporative demand was more remarkable than water supply limitation. Water stress can substantially reduce canopy conductance and leaf area index, and hence decreasing photosynthesis. Water stress suppressed GPP while having little influence on ecosystem respiration, resulting in the increase of net carbon uptake. NEP decreased as a reaction to water stress when PWSI was more than 0.4, whereas WUE was enhanced under moderate and severe water stress (PWSI > 0.6). Compared to NEP, the difference of ET between cloudy and sunny sky conditions was more evident at the same PWSI value. Therefore, cloudy sky conditions were beneficial to enhancing WUE. Water stress restricted the mixed plantation in the period of spring-early summer. At the annual scale, the mixed plantation was exposed to moderate water stress. The PWSI approach is a promising tool quantifying water stress in forest ecosystems.

AB Accurate estimation of field-scale root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) is essential for hydro-meteorological and agricultural management. The cosmic-ray neutron probe (CRNP) is an innovative technique for field-scale soil moisture observation. However, it is limited at deeper depths, and requires suitable methods for scaling the CRNP effective depth to represent the root-zone layer (up to 100 cm depth). A merging framework was developed in this study for improving field-scale RZSM with the CRNP via coupling the representative ancillary RZSM information with cosmic-ray soil moisture. By using ancillary RZSM retrieved at the most time stable location, this approach alleviates the problems associated with lack of independent datasets, while maintaining scale representativeness. A linear autoregressive model was adopted to forecast the errors between two input datasets (the cosmic-ray soil moisture and ancillary RZSM) and a reference product, which was computed by spatially weighting the deepest in-situ soil moisture measurements apart from the most time stable location. The variances of estimated errors were then used to compute a suitable weight for each single product by following the original linear combination of forecasts, and subsequently merging the ancillary RZSM and cosmic-ray soil moisture. Performance of the merged RZSM in comparison to input datasets and exponential filter-based RZSM over three different environments was evaluated against the reference RZSM product. The results indicated that differences in vegetation coverages related to total aboveground and belowground biomass accumulation, root water uptake rate and canopy density are the major factors controlling the temporal variation in merged RZSM, and they can be partly interpreted via the framework procedure. Superior performance achieved by the merging framework demonstrated its robustness in improving field-scale RZSM measurement compared to other products. This study also underlines the strong relationship between input data quality and the performance of the selected merging method, with respect to variations of CRNP effective depths. Overall, the merging framework is simple to apply, enables unrestricted-use in different environments, and is flexible to combine further standalone data sources.

AB Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) acts as major pathway to transport solute-laden terrestrial-sourced fresh groundwater, as well as re-circulated marine water to the global oceans. The study area, Bay of Bengal (BoB), a part of the Indian Ocean, receives one of world's highest terrestrial riverine fresh water discharge, sediment and solute flux from the adjacent Himalayan and cratonic South Asia. Thus, together with the monsoon-dominated tropical climate, it forms one of the most complicated, productive and interactive global hydrological systems. However, understanding such topical phenomena needs intricate mechanistic understanding, based on high resolution data, which are barely available from the BoB. Delineation of stable isotopic and chemical signature of hydrologic-sourced components in the SGD to the BoB would help to identify the intra-annual to diurnal-scale impact of seasonality and tidal cycles, as well as interactions with other surface water bodies. This study provides one of the first documentation of such high-resolution, temporally-variable, stable isotope patterns of SGD in coastal systems of the BoB, and possibly of any tropical ocean. During post-monsoon season, the discharging groundwater was observed to have depleted delta O-18 (ranges - 2.12 parts per thousand to - 4.19 parts per thousand) and low Cl- concentrations (745 to > 11,500 ppm) (seepage water), which is closely associated with the groundwater delta O-18 composition (-3.18 parts per thousand to -4.05 parts per thousand) and Cl- content (775 to > 5900 ppm) range. In pre-monsoon season depleted delta O-18 values suggests that regional groundwater contributes up to 45 m from high tide line (HTL) (up to 88%), and re-circulated seawater-sourced SGD dominates 45 m to 110 m (extent of study transect) offshore. In post-monsoon season, terrestrial-sourced groundwater predominates the SGD composition (up to 99%) till 110 m. Changes in delta O-18 and Cl- content, in pre-monsoon season indicates enhanced infiltration of seawater in the seepage face, due to lower terrestrial-sourced freshwater discharge, whereas, in post-monsoon terrestrial-sourced, resident freshwater dominates in the seepage face. The study suggests that SGD are sourced to interactions between local-regional hydrological systems, and do reflect their compositional variability. It also provides insight of influencing physico-chemical mechanisms, ranging from seasonal to daily-tidal time-scales. The outcome of this study thus may provide intricate insights in delineating the coastal hydrologic and biogeo-chemical processes, as well as detecting, carbon sinks, nutrient sources and primary productivity in a tropical ocean.

DE Water shortage mitigation; Proactive trigger development; System

ID SOIL-MOISTURE; FORECASTS
AB A complete water shortage mitigation plan which includes water shortage indicators and mitigation measures is essential in adaptive water resources management. Current water shortage triggers used to manage water supply shortages typically recognize only past and current hydrologic conditions and system states, e.g., reservoir storage or water levels. A systematic approach to evaluate the effectiveness of water shortage mitigation measures is often lacked. This study proposes a general framework based on daily simulation-optimization computation scheme to develop water shortage mitigation plan. It includes an innovative simulation-optimization based water shortage trigger framework incorporating both demand and supply side uncertainties to evaluate the state of a water supply system. Stochastically generated demand/supply ensembles were used to simulate system decision variables that were used jointly with past and current hydrologic conditions to prescribe water shortage stages. Each water shortage stage was tied to specific demand and supply side adaptive management actions. A mixed integer programming model optimizing source allocation from surface water harvesting, groundwater production and a desalination plant was then used to minimize operational costs and protect the environment while meeting regional demand. Cumulative mitigation actions were implemented as the system moves progressively to a severe water shortage stage. Retrospective analysis using observed flow and demand in the past decade (2005-2015) was used to vet the approach and demonstrate the advantage of forward looking water shortage trigger development scheme. A combination of mitigation measures is evaluated using stochastic flow and demand in the year 2030, revealing that increased magnitude of groundwater production under severe water shortage situations could be largely (50%) reduced, owing to proactive mitigation actions. The framework was applied to Tampa Bay Water and it has general applications to regional water resources management for utilities across US and beyond.

AB In sharp open-channel bends, there exists nonlinear interactions between streamwise and cross-stream velocities, which leads to the adjustment of flow energy transport, increases the energy dissipation and eventually influences the development of river bends. However, previous studies have not yet fully understood the mechanisms underlying the transport and dissipation of energy in open-channel bends. In addition, energy dissipation is directly related to the evolution of enstrophy Omega.Omega/2. However, it has not yet received much attention in the study of the resistance in meandering rivers. To gain an insight into these mechanisms, with the aid of detailed experimental data collected in a sharp open-channel bend, this study quantified the impacts of the key terms in the kinetic energy equation and the enstrophy equation. Results show that the term related to the transport of kinetic energy by cross-stream circulation is at least an order of magnitude larger than the other terms in the kinetic energy equation, which contributes significantly to the redistribution of kinetic energy over the cross section. The term related to the production of turbulent kinetic energy in the kinetic energy equation shows the smallest order of magnitude and thus is almost negligible for the time-averaged flow field. Furthermore, over most of the measured area, the term related to the centrifugal force shows values of at least an order of magnitude larger than the other terms in the enstrophy equation, which means that this term exerts the dominant influence on the energy dissipation. The results also revealed that the transformation process is insensitive to the variations in Froude number. These results are expected to improve the understanding of the complete process of energy transformation, especially the resistance caused by secondary flow in meandering rivers.

AB Deep soil water infiltration is a key hydrological process in seasonally frozen regions, and displays a distinct behavior from that in other unfrozen regions; however, the seasonal dynamics and key controls of deep soil water infiltration in the seasonally frozen region of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau (QTP) are still poorly understood. In this study, we examine the seasonal dynamics of deep soil water infiltration, and attempt to quantitatively assess the relative influences of several driving factors by applying a random forests statistical analysis. The following key results were obtained. Deep soil water infiltration shows marked seasonal variation. Rainfall intensity exerts little effect on the seasonal dynamics of deep soil water infiltration as almost all rainfall returns to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration. No infiltration occurred when the depth of lower layer frozen soil reached 29 cm, whereas deep infiltration increased during the thawing of soil frost, suggesting that deep infiltration is impeded by soil freezing. Overall, the observed seasonal dynamics of deep soil water infiltration and volumetric soil moisture content were similar during the freeze-thaw process. Furthermore, deep soil water infiltration was more strongly influenced by deep volumetric soil moisture than by shallower volumetric soil moisture. Our results suggest that the topsoil Mattic Epipedon, soil organic matter content, and root systems' role in vertical moisture movement should be taken into consideration when modeling hydrological processes in alpine meadows.

AB Arid and semi-arid regions experience large hydroclimatic variability and decadal-scale droughts. During droughts, the reduced water availability alters the biophysical properties of the catchments which leads to non-stationarity in rainfall-runoff (r-r) relationships. Uncertainty exists regarding the mechanisms causing r-r non-stationarity, especially at seasonal scales. This study analyses endogenous and exogenous catchment mechanisms which could possibly influence r-r relationships in two case study catchments in southeast Australia (SEA). The case study catchments are chosen such that they are representative of arid to semi-arid catchments that experience large climatic variability and decadal-scale droughts. The results demonstrate that endogenous catchment mechanisms (i.e. groundwater table, baseflow and vegetation) have stronger influences on non-stationarity in r-r relationships than exogenous catchment mechanisms like temperature and potential evapo-transpiration. These findings highlight the importance of understanding changes in r-r relationships in order to develop more realistic and reliable hydrological models that are needed to quantify and adapt to the impacts of changing catchment or hydroclimatic conditions. While this study is focussed on SEA the findings are relevant to all catchments that experience large climatic variability and decadal-scale droughts.

AB A modelling strategy is formulated, which collectively consists of separate Multiple Models (MM) and uses Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to combine these MMs to learn from data. The procedure is at two levels: at Level 1, three Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are constructed, which comprise Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Sugeno Fuzzy Logic (SFL) and Multiple-Neuro-Fuzzy (Multi-NF) but their outputs are directed to BMA at the next level; at Level 2, BMA is used to combine ANN, SFL and Multi-NF for better predictions and with facilities for quantifying uncertainty. The model performance is tested using the data from Urmia aquifer in the West Azerbaijan province, northwest Iran, where due to the absence of participatory water usage management practices both Lake Urmia and its surrounding 12 aquifers (including the study area) are distressed. The modelling strategy and its results on Urmia aquifer provides an insight to the study area and will be used to investigate ways of arresting the decline in the water table of the aquifer but this should be feasible only by developing a series of management plans, including basin management plans, aquifer management plans, drought plans, water cycle studies. Under such an integrated management system, the model developed here is demonstrably well-placed to serve as an operational management tool for the aquifer.

AB The concept of return period and its estimation are pivotal in risk management for many geophysical applications. Return period is usually estimated by inferring a probability distribution from an observed series of the random process of interest and then applying the classical equation, i.e. the inverse of the exceedance probability. Traditionally, we form a statistical sample by selecting, from the "complete" time series (e.g. at the daily scale), those values that can reasonably be considered as realizations of independent extremes, e.g. annual maxima or peaks over a certain high threshold. Such a selection procedure entails that a large number of observations are discarded; this wastage of information could have important consequences in practical problems, where the reduction of the already small size of common hydrological records significantly affects the reliability of the estimates. Under such circumstances, it is crucial to exploit all the available information. To this end, we investigate the advantages of estimating the return period without any data decimation, by using the full dataset. The proposed procedure, denoted as Complete Time-series Analysis (CTA), exploits the property that the average interarrival time (i.e. return period) of potentially damaging events is not affected by the dependence structure of the underlying process, even for cyclo-stationary (e.g. seasonal) processes. For the sake of illustration, the CTA is compared to that based on annual maxima selection, through a simple non-parametric approach, discussing advantages and limitations of the method. Results suggest that the proposed CTA approach provides a more conservative return period estimation in an holistic implementation framework within a broader range of return period values than that pertaining to other methods, which means not only the largest extremes that are the focus of extreme value theory.

AB Agricultural drought is related to meteorological and hydrologic conditions and the resilience vegetation to water deficit that have negative impacts on agricultural production. In this study, an integrated drought condition index (IDCI) was developed by integrating precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, temperature, soil moisture, and vegetation conditions. The performance of IDCI in agricultural drought monitoring was evaluated by comparing with standing drought indices, such as sc-PDSI (self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index), SMCI (Soil Moisture Condition Index), and SCYI (Scaled Crop Yields Index). Then, IDCI was used to characterize the spatiotemporal pattern of agricultural drought across Inner Mongolia, China. Results indicated that: (1) IDCI performed as well in drought monitoring as did sc-PDSI and SCYI. However, IDCI performed better than did SPEI3 (standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index at a time scale of 3 months), SMCI (Soil Moisture Condition Index) and VCI (Vegetation Condition Index) with respect to reliable and stable drought monitoring, detection of soil moisture and reflection of agricultural loss; (2) during the growing season (May-September), the frequency of droughts with higher than moderate drought intensity tended to be diminishing from May to August, and was amplifying again from August to September; (3) during 2000 to 2014, the drought severity was subject to regular variability with consecutive droughts during transitions between drought conditions; (4) compared to SMCI, VCI and SPEI3, IDCI is highly related to SCYI for maize with correlation coefficient of up to 0.788; the correlation coefficients between IDCI and SCYI for soybean and potato are larger than 0.5, while the SCYI for wheat is related to droughts with severe and even higher severity based on IDCI. The idea behind the development of IDCI can be referenced for drought monitoring in other regions of the globe.

AB The influence of long-term suspended sediment dynamics on stormwater pond performance should not be ignored, but is often neglected in pond design and performance evaluation. This paper provides systematic simulated quantification of long-term suspended sedimentological effects on stormwater pond performance. Integrated hydrological and two-dimensional hydro-morphodynamic modelling and simulations were carried over a 32-year period (1984-2015) covering 3896 rainfall events with a wide range of rainfall volumes, durations and intensities. Three event-based hypothetical rainfall scenarios: non-flood condition (5-year), sewer design condition (30-year), and river flood condition (100-year) rainfall events with 1-h duration, were also simulated for comparison between the traditional event-based approach and the novel approach presented in this study. Simulation results show that the flood peak attenuation and delay are more pronounced for small ( < 5-year) and medium ( < 30-year) flood events. The long-term continuous simulation results indicate that the pond provides positive annual trap efficiencies varying from 2% to 69% for 31 of 32 years, providing long-term water quality benefits downstream. However, an extreme rainfall event in year 2012 flush out the accumulated sedimentation as a shock load to the downstream river, leading to a negative trap efficiency of - 11%. The spatially averaged sediment deposition rate, as predicted by the model, varies with a mean (SD) of 2 (1.34) cm/year over the study period, which resulted in a 24% loss in the pond's volume over 32 years. The impact of the loss in storage on pond flood attenuation capacity are explored at regular time intervals over the study period. The results indicate that reduction in the pond's flood attenuation capacity is relatively more pronounced for medium (30-year) and extreme (100-year) flood events than the frequent small flood (5-year) events. The variation in annual sediment loading with rainfall quantities and patterns are also explored.

AB Potholes are an extraordinary abiotic micro geomorphic feature on the granite and quartzite topography of the Subarnarekha River basin. These erosional features are carved by the running water actions of River Subamarekha and its tributaries. The study has been conducted on 17 sites (n = 1707) which are exemplary for the development of this micro fluvial feature located on the rejuvenated middle part of Subarnarekha River basin. Hydrological and geological factors are imperative for their formation. Joint length, joint density, joint orientation, rock hardness, variations of fluvial hydraulic, bed roughness, river bed slope and hydraulic gradient are conducive factors for the development of this geomorphic feature. Monsoon is the ideal season for carving these features by river turbulence, when abrasive work of river is predominant on the river bed (monsoon = 3000-6500 kg. m(2)s(-3), non-monsoon = 0.50-3.0 kg. m(2)s(-3)). The evolutionary sequence of potholes is from round to oval and then elongated with vertical scouring. The relation between pothole radius and depth has been established to explain the process of its expansion. Joint length shows positive relation (R-2 = 0.71) with pothole area while joint density has a negative relation (R-2 = 0.29) as these are structurally weaker zones, characterised by destruction of these features. Suspended load is also a hindrance in their formation. Sites with high suspended load are delineated as pothole destructive zones. The mean dynamic evolution of circular, oval and elongated shaped potholes occurs at spatio-temporal level (Delta(o)e = 0.005 - 0.60 m(3), Delta(c)e = 0.01 - 0.25 m(3), Delta(e)e = 0.005-0.30 m(3)) and the initiation of this development depends on inner depth and radius of individual pothole.

AB Groundwater recharge by precipitation is often assumed by practitioners as well as scientists to be a slow process of filtration through layers of uniform texture analogous to Darcy's law. In most basins, however, rainwater also finds its way through macropores and preferential pathways to the shallow unconfined aquifers within hours of falling. Recharge phases may extend over several days, increasing groundwater levels, stored volume and hence baseflows into adjoining rivers. In this study, groundwater recharge and storage are computed from baseflow as separated with a nonlinear reservoir algorithm from time series of daily flows at gauging stations in northern Germany. Results are compared to groundwater level fluctuation in the catchments and to daily seepage rates measured in a lysimeter station. Peak times of the fast transfer of rain water through the vadose zone are generally the same. However, while recharge from baseflow ends when baseflow assumes its typical recession, the attenuation of lysimeter seepage may last much longer. The volume of lysimeter seepage is generally higher than the recharge in catchments due not only to different vegetation but also to rim effects impeding direct runoff. Furthermore, the lysimeter walls allow vertical fluxes only. Without further evidence or improved devices, lysimeter seepage should therefore not be indicated as groundwater recharge for the site or catchment. Findings also indicate that the shape of derived recharge unit responses is practically time invariant but with a strong seasonal variation in the recharge-rainfall ratio of precipitation events.

AB Challenges in balancing freshwater demands and the long-term availability of freshwater from small island aquifers warrants responsive management, whereby groundwater conditions guide decisions about pumping rates to avoid well salinization. We evaluate responsive freshwater lens management for the first time, through transient, three-dimensional, dispersive modelling of Bonriki Island (Kiribati). Both responsive- and fixed-management scenarios are explored, including a novel pumping redistribution strategy. Modelling results reveal that responsive management offers superior lens protection, particularly during droughts. Pumping redistribution produced lower salinities but greater lens depletion. All scenarios indicate that the Bonriki lens will continue to decline, consistent with previous shorter-time-frame projections. Lower lens storage losses are attainable by abstracting groundwater at the maximum acceptable salinity, contrary to traditional strategies of seeking the lowest available salinities. The methodology developed in this research provides a blueprint for investigating responsive, "monitor-and-react" management scenarios, which we advocate as best practice for balancing freshwater demands with long-term lens security.

AB The interactions of hydrological variables in the terrestrial hydrological cycle are complex. To better predict the variables, distributed and physically based models are used as they account for the complexity of interactions. In this study, we addressed the joint simulation of water- and energy fluxes and the potential benefit of flux measurements in the parameter estimation process. For this purpose, we applied the hydrological model GEOtop to a prealpine catchment in southern Germany (River Rott, 55 km(2)) over two recent summer episodes, as a test case. Due to its complexity, the model is computationally demanding and only a limited number of forward runs can be afforded in inverse modelling and parameter estimation. We applied the gradient-based nonlinear Gauss-Marquardt-Levenberg (GML) parameter estimation method and linked the GEOtop model to the Parameter ESTimation tool (PEST). Using this developed GEOtop-PEST interface, we particularly investigated the value added by including turbulent flux data in the parameter estimation process, and analyse the impact of the additional flux data on the uncertainty bounds of the parameters. To better understand the interplay of the model parameters and to identify the dominating parameters in the calibration process, we also conducted a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We were able to identify a set of model parameters that reproduced both observed streamflow and turbulent heat fluxes reasonably well. The majority of the estimated parameters were highly sensitive to the considered variables. We showed that the confidence bounds of estimated parameters are narrowed significantly when considering not only streamflow observations but also turbulent flux measurements in the calibration process. In this manner, correlations between estimated parameters could also be reduced.

AB Urban flooding occurs frequently in the world and urban hydrological models are widely applied in urban flood management and disaster mitigation. In this study, an enhanced inundation method (EIM) for urban flood hazard mapping at the large catchment scale is proposed. EIM can be easily coupled with urban hydrological models and the coupled framework can consider both source flooding and non-source flooding in floodwater generation. In EIM, the floodwater spreading order in the positive process is based on the topological relationship between depression outlets; the floodwater from lower depression elements is considered as a feedback process. These improvements make this proposed method suitable for inundation estimation in large urban catchments. Dahongmen (DHM) catchment in Beijing, China was selected as the case study area to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. Historical inundation records during one heavy storm were applied to test the performance of the method. EIM is compared with USISM (urban storm-inundation simulation method) on the flood hazard map in the DHM catchment, which reveals the effectiveness of the improvements. The results show that all inundation locations are successfully identified by EIM and are distributed in flooding areas (water depth greater than 0.15 m) in the catchment. The average relative error of simulated inundation depths is 15%, which indicates that EIM can successfully simulate flooding scopes and depths in the study area. The results revealed that EIM can be a valuable tool for mapping urban flood hazards at the large catchment scale based on GIS techniques.

AB Palicourea marcgravii (Rubiaceae) is considered the most important toxic plant affecting livestock farming in Brazil. This study describes an outbreak of spontaneous poisoning by P. marcgravii in sheep. Forty-nine sheep died while showing clinical signs of sudden death after having access to the plant. During the necropsy, P. marcgravii leaves were observed in the rumens of the animals. Histopathological analysis demonstrated hydropic degeneration of the kidneys. Monofluoracetate concentration obtained in Palicourea samples was 0.53% (5.3 mu g/mg). These findings collectively indicate that the affected animals died from poisoning due to P. marcgravii.

AB The aim of this study was to assess anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-genotoxic and immunomodulatory effects of honey bee venom (HBV) on adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats. Thirty-five rats were equally divided into a negative control (NC), a positive control (PC) and low, moderate and high doses (2, 4 and 20 mg/kg, respectively) of HBV treatment groups. Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA) was given to the rats to form arthritis. The treatment groups were treated with HBV for 3 consecutive weeks. After the treatment, plasma IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and TGF-beta 1, total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities and mononuclear leukocyte (MNL) DNA damage levels were measured. Oxidative stress index (OSI) was calculated. IL-beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta 1, IFN-gamma, TOS, OSI, DNA damage levels and MPO activities were significantly higher and TAS levels were lower in the PC group than the NC. After low-doses of HBV treatment IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta 1, TOS, OSI, MPO and MNL-DNA damage levels significantly decreased according to the PC, while IFN-gamma and TAS levels increased. The differences in moderate and high-dose HBV treatment groups were not as significant as low HBV doses. Low-doses of HBV has been shown to treat RA with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, by preventing DNA damage. However, these effects have not been observed as strong at higher doses of HBV. In summary, HBV may be an effective option to ameliorate RA, but the optimization of the therapeutic dose has a crucial role.

AB The most frequently reported fatal Lepiota ingestions are due to L. brunneoincarnata. We present a case of L. brunneoincarnata poisoning with endoscopic nasobiliary drainage known to be the first in China. The patient suffered gastrointestinal symptoms 9 h post ingestion of mushrooms. The patient was hospitalized 4 days after eating the mushrooms with jaundice. The peak ALT, AST, APTT, TBIL and DBIL values of the patient were as follow: ALT, 2980 U/L (day 4 post ingestion); AST, 1910 U/L (day 4 post ingestion); APTT, 92.8 seconds (day 8 post ingestion), TBIL, 136 mu mol/L (day 10 post ingestion), DBIL 74 mu mol/L (day 10 post ingestion). UPLC-ESI-MS/MS was used to detect the peptide toxins in the mushroom and biological samples from the patient. We calculated that the patient may have ingested a total of 29.05 mg amatoxin from 300 g mushrooms, consisting of 19.91 mg alpha-amanitin, 9.1 mg beta-amanitin, and 0.044 mg gamma-amanitin. Amatoxins could be detected in bile even on day 6 after ingestion of L. brunneoincarnata. With rehydration, endoscopic nasobiliary drainage and intravenous infusion of Legalon SIL, the patient recovered after serious hepatotoxicity developed.

AB Deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination is indicated as a worldwide problem since it causes economic losses for the grain and is a potential threat to both animal and human health. This study concentrated on DON-induced oxidative damage and the accompanying nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) translocation during DON-induced maternal hepatotoxicity. The 0, 1.0 and 2.5 mg/kg/day of DON were used as doses for the experiment during gestation days. DON slightly increased the levels of ALT and AST in GD12.5 d instead of GD18.5 d. Oxidative stress and anti-oxidization system were both found to be activated in the experiment which marked by ROS, MDA and GSH increasing, especially on GD12.5 d. The levels of HO-1 were significantly increased by DON exposure at different two time points. Moreover, Nrf2 translocation appeared both in GD 12.5 d and GD 18.5 d. In conclusion, DON-induced ROS accumulation may cause maternal liver damage in the initial stages, but the related stimulation of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway improves the removal of ROS and decreases the level of oxidative stress thereby protecting the liver damage. Therefore, upregulating the Nrf2-dependent response is one of the potential methods that protects maternal liver from DON-induced oxidative damage.

The TTX toxicity was 10.8 +/- 3.9 MU/g muscle, 6.3 +/- 0.6 MU/g viscera and 6.3 +/- 0.6 MU/g eggs in mean value. Merely dcGTX2 and dcSTX were detected in ten Specimens, ranging from 0.01 to 0.77 mu g/g. Analyses suggested that these Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda contain TTX and its analogues as the major toxin and PSPs as the minor, respectively. Besides, no DSPs were found.

ID TOXIC PRINCIPLES
AB In this retrospective series of 97 cases of manchineel fruit ingestion reported to French Poison Control Centers between 2009 and 2017, we investigated cases of poisoning due to manchineel fruit (from the Hippomane mancinella tree). This fruit is known to be responsible for oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal tract lesions and possibly hypotension and bradycardia (previously attributed to the presence of physostigmine). The most commonly observed clinical signs were oropharyngeal pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea and oropharyngeal irritation. No major gastrointestinal tract lesions were observed in the five cases in which upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy was performed. One case of laryngeal edema and one case of bradycardia were observed, but analysis of the harvested fruits did not confirm the presence of physostigmine. Ingestion of manchineel fruit can cause mild abdominal pain and digestive irritation, requiring medical attention. Rarely, when several fruits have been ingested, severe oropharyngeal injury or hemodynamic disorders may require otorhinolaryngological consultation or cardiac monitoring for several hours, respectively.

AB Larkspurs (Delphinium spp.) are native perennial plants that have a serious toxic potential to cattle on foothill and mountain rangelands in the western United States. Livestock death due to larkspur toxicity is attributed to norditerpenoid alkaloids. Diagnosing plant poisonings in livestock is often challenging. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of three matrices; earwax, oral fluid, and nasal mucus, as noninvasive specimens to determine livestock exposure to larkspurs. Reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry was used to analyze for norditerpene alkaloids, in all three matrices, in cattle administered a single dose of larkspur. Earwax, oral fluid, and nasal mucus were collected over 6 days post dosing. Methyllycaconitine (MLA) and deltaline concentrations in earwax ranged from 0.4 +/- 0.1 to 0.2 +/- 0.06 and 0.6 +/- 0.5 to 0.11 +/- 0.08 ng/mg, respectively. MLA and deltaline concentrations in oral fluid ranged from 0.08 +/- 0.03 to 0.01 +/- 0.002 ng/mg and 0.07 +/- 0.03 ng/mg to not detected (ND), respectively. MLA and deltaline concentrations in nasal mucus ranged from 0.2 +/- 0.13 to 0.03 +/- 0.01 ng/mg and 0.2 +/- 0.12 ng/mg to ND, respectively. The ability to detect differing norditerpene alkaloid chemotypes from two different Delphinium spp. was also possible in the three matrices. This study demonstrates the potential of earwax, oral fluid, and nasal mucus as noninvasive specimens for chemical analyses to aid in the diagnosis of livestock that may have been exposed to and poisoned by larkspur plants.

AB Dendrobatid frogs sequester alkaloid defenses from dietary arthropods. Here, we provide experimental evidence that mother strawberry poison frogs (Oophaga pumilio) provision alkaloids to tadpoles. Captive-raised females were fed the synthetic alkaloid decahydroquinoline (DHQ), which we subsequently quantified in their skin, eggs, and developing tadpoles. DHQ quantity was positively associated with tadpole mass/development, suggesting high sequestration rates by tadpoles. These data confirm that tadpoles obtain nutrition and alkaloids by feeding exclusively on maternally provisioned eggs.

AB Marine toxins are known among several causes of toxin induced renal injury. Enzymatic mechanism by phospholipase A(2) is responsible for acute kidney injury (AKI) in sea snake envenoming without any change in cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. Cnidarian toxins form pores in the cell membrane with Ca influx storm resulting in cell death. Among plankton toxins domoic acid, palytoxin and maitotoxin cause renal injury by ion transport into the cell through ion channels resulting in renal cell swelling and lysis. Okadaic acid, calyculin A, microcystin LR and nodularin cause AM by serine threonine phosphatase inhibition and hyperphosphorylation with increased activity of Ca2+/calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II, increased cytosolic Ca2+, reactive oxygen species, caspase and P53. Renal injury by plankons is mostly subclinical and requires sensitive biomarker for diagnosis. In this respect repeated consumption of plankton toxin contaminated seafood is a risk of developing chronic renal disease. The subject deserves more clinical study and scientific attention.

AB Sterigmatocystin (STC) is structurally close to the mycotoxin aflatoxin B-1 as it shares its biosynthetic pathway with aflatoxins. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the short-term (24 h) effects of STC contaminated diet at different doses (1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg STC kg(-1) feed) in one year old common carp juveniles. Liver samples were taken in 8-h intervals. The markers of the lipid peroxidation showed moderate changes after the application of sterigmatocystin-contaminated diet, significant elevations were only observed in the lowest applied dose group of sterigmatocystin after 16 h of exposure. Reduced glutathione content showed higher levels than control group after 16 h of exposure as effect of low dose of sterigmatocystin. Glutathione peroxidase (GPX4) activity was lower than control in the group treated with 2 mg STC kg(-1) feed after 24 h of exposure. Gene expression measurements of keap1, nrf2, gpx4a, gpx4b and gss genes revealed a dual response. Down regulation or near control values were observed 8 h after exposure which was followed by an induction 16 and 24 h after exposure. In case of gsr, gene expression values returned to control levels by the 24th hour. In summary, these results suggest that lower doses of STC caused oxidative stress earlier than higher doses, which efficiently activated the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, while higher doses revealed long-drawn activation of this pathway.

AB Venom from the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis dramatically elevates sorbitol levels in its natural fly hosts. In humans, sorbitol elevation is associated with complications of diabetes. Here we demonstrate that venom also induces this disease-relevant phenotype in human cells, and investigate possible pathways involved. Key findings are that (a) low doses of Nasonia venom elevate sorbitol levels in human renal mesangial cells (HRMCs) without changing glucose or fructose levels; (b) venom is a much more potent inducer of sorbitol elevation than glucose; (c) low venom doses significantly alter expression of genes involved in sterol and alcohol metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and chemical/stimulus response; (d) although venom treatment does not alter expression of the key sorbitol pathway gene aldose reductase (AR); (e) venom elevates expression of a related gene implicated in diabetes complications (AKR1C3) as well as the fructose metabolic gene (GFPT2). Although elevated sorbitol is accepted as a major contributor to secondary complications of diabetes, the molecular mechanism of sorbitol regulation and its contribution to diabetes complications are not fully understood. Our findings suggest that genes other than AR could contribute to sorbitol regulation, and more broadly illustrate the potential of parasitoid venoms for medical application.

The microstructure and constituent of the samples were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM and EDS analyses. The flexural strength was analyzed using 3-point bending tests, and the bioactive behavior was evaluated by immersion test in simulated body fluid (SBF) solution. Compared with the samples prepared by single method, the results suggested that the lithium disilicate glass-ceramic mixtures combined by sol-gel and melting methods form better cross-linked interlocking microstructure to achieve higher flexural strength, simultaneously with excellent bioactive performance, which could be a promising candidate for restorative dental biomedical application.

AB Transition metal oxides nanomaterials are attractive for electrical, optical and magnetic applications due to their small polaron hopping, narrow band gap and strong spin-orbit interaction. Herein, 80 nm Fe3O4/Co3O4 core shell nanocomposites were synthesized and doped to heavy metal oxides glasses to evaluate the influence to glass structure, spectra and properties using varies characterization techniques. SEM, BET and XRD analysis confirm the successful synthesis of core-shell nanocomposites, and XPS, FT-IR and Raman spectra reveal the modification of CoO6 and CoO4 groups on glass frame BiO3, BiO6, PbO4 and BO3 units. UV-VIS spectra show a red-shift on cutoff wavelength with two absorption bands at 550 nm and 750 nm due to T-4(1g)(F) -> T-2(1g) (H) octahedral transition of Co2+ and T-5(2g) -> E-5(g) octahedral transition of Co3+ ions, respecitvely, which in turn contributed to electric conductivity. The evolution of Co2+ and Co3+ and their modification on glass induced changes on thermal, mechanical, magnetic and magneto optical properties.

Detailed crystallization kinetics study was performed, revealing that the presence of oxygen leads to a lowered activation energy and steeper onset of the process single-curve-averaged masterplot approach was used to deal with the temperature-differentiated complexity of the crystallization. Direct observations by infrared microscopy have shown that the presence of oxygen leads to a formation of robust surface crystalline layer, which prevents powder sintering and bulk samples deformation by viscous flow, and to a more rapid nucleation and crystal growth within the sample volume. Based on the viscosity values estimated for the crystallization temperatures, an explanation for the accelerated volume crystallization was proposed, employing the quasi-stationary conditions contributing to better cohesivity of critical nuclei and crystal/glass interface. The existence of the surface crystalline layer however prevents the sample from reaching full crystallinity.

AB The consistent development of the waste-minimisation and recycling-oriented technologies in the most resource- and energy-intensive industries is crucial for sustainable development. Chemical activation based on a non-fired or low-temperature approach for the production of binders from glassy aluminosilicates, including a wide range of wastes and by-products from different industries, is an intensively developing and promising clean technology that finds application in construction and building materials, management of hazardous and nuclear waste, etc. Blended binders are designed using a mixture of mineral materials as a tool, through the regulation of composition and structure, to obtain materials with controlled performance. The resulting materials in turn improve engineering performance and aid the valorisation of different types of wastes and by-products. This is one of the main trends in the development of the modern cement industry, including the alkali activation technology. Coal fly ash is one of the large-tonnage wastes that is effectively converted by alkali activation in binders and compatible with many mineral supplementary materials. This paper reviews (i) the supplementary mineral materials of natural and waste origin from different industries for alkali activated fly ash (class F) cements (AAFA); (ii) the composition, structure, and properties formation process of AAFA incorporated with blending and modifying materials, and (iii) the feasibility for improvement of the structures and properties of mixed AAFA.

AB Silicate glasses have been synthesised with a fixed 8 mol% of Fe3O4 and sodium oxide varying from 12 mol% to 20 mol%. The environment of the Fe ion was examined by Extended X-ray Absorption Fine structure and Mossbauer spectroscopy which have shown tetrahedral coordination of oxygen around Fe regardless of the oxidation state of iron. Mossbauer data indicate increasing; distortion of these tetrahedral units and Fe3+ to Fe2+ ratios, with increasing sodium concentration. Raman spectroscopic studies have shown the presence of Q(n) linkages for n = 0 to n = 4. For the sodium silicate glass without iron, the single most common linkage is Q(3) (similar to 50%) suggesting the role of the alkali to be disruptive to the continuity of the silica random network. For the iron containing glasses, the main linkage is Q(2) (similar to 65%). However, in the latter glasses the fraction of Q(3) linkages although considerably less (similar to 10% to similar to 20%) than Q(2) is shown to increase with alkali content due to the concomitant rise of Fe3+ ions which are known to be network formers.

AB Barium borosilicate glasses (BaO-SiO2-B2O3) with the addition of 5-25 wt% bismuth oxide as additive (equivalent to 1.23-5.88 mol% of Bi2O3 in glasses) were prepared for using as a sealant for planar solid oxide fuel cells. The effect of Bi2O3 addition on thermal properties, structure, crystallization and joining interface of the BaO-SiO2-B2O3 glasses was investigated. IR spectra showed a significant effect of Bi2O3 addition in the BaO-SiO2-B2O3 glass structure, causing a progressive conversion of [BO3] to [BO4] unit in the glasses. The Bi2O3 addition made the BaO-SiO2-B2O3 glass network less rigid resulting in a decrease of a glass transition temperature and a softening point but still maintains the thermal expansion match between the Bi2O3-containing glasses and samaria-doped ceria solid electrolyte as well as an iron-chromium metallic interconnect. 5-wt% Bi2O3 obviously decelerated the crystallization of the Bi2O3-containing glasses. Good adhesion of the 5-wt% Bi2O3-coritaining glass sealant with samaria-doped ceria electrolyte and iron-chromium metallic interconnect without any gaps was achieved at prolong test for 30 h at 800 degrees C.

AB The glass samples were prepared by the traditional melting method with red mud as the main raw material. The effect of SnO2 content on the structure, crystallization behavior and corrosion resistance of the glass was studied by FTIR, XRD, and SEM. The results showed that the incorporation of SnO2 increased the crystallization tendency of the glass. With the content of SnO2 up to 1.96 wt%, some crystals precipitated in the glass. FTIR spectroscopy indicated that the vibration of the [SiO4] group first shifted to the low wave number as the SnO2 content increased to 0.99 wt%, and then moved to the high wave number with the SnO2 content further increasing. With the SnO2 content increasing, the alkali resistance of the glass was increased. When the content of SnO2 was 1.48 wt% and 1.96 wt%, the mass loss of the glass in alkaline solution was 1.12% and 1.04% respectively. The water resistance of the glass was first reduced, then gradually increased after the SnO2 content exceeded 0.99 wt%.

AB The aim of this work is to generate and study the clusters formed as a result of the interaction of laser pulses with solid state materials such as chalcogenide glasses. The other target is to determine the stoichiometry of the clusters generated from studied chalcogenide glasses and their thin films in order to get the information about structural fragments presents in the plasma plume. The aims were achieved by exploiting laser desorption ionization (LDI) with quadrupole ion trap time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) examination of the GexSe1-x (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.33) chalcogenide glasses and Ge0.2Se0.8 and Ge0.33Se0.67 thin films prepared by magnetron sputtering. The interaction of laser pulses with GexSe1-x chalcogenide glasses and their thin films produces many positively and negatively charged unary and binary (Ge-a(+/-), Se-b(+/-), and GeaSeb+/- clusters. About similar to 50 different clusters were identified for each glass sample. We assume that some species indicate local structure of the studied materials. However, other clusters are formed either by a fragmentation of original glass structure or by laser ablation synthesis. When using parafilm, many new, higher mass clusters were produced. The results were compared with LDI TOFMS analysis of Ge:Se elemental mixtures. Concluding, LDI TOFMS is useful technique not only for the generation and study of the clusters but also it gives partial structural information about glasses and other materials as well as information about processes proceeding in the plasma.

AB The heat capacity of four samples of high-purity chalcogenide glasses GeSx:nBi (x = 1.25, 1.35, 1.4, 1.6; n = 1 at. %) in the region of 300-750 K was measured by the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method. According to the data obtained, standard thermodynamic functions (STF) were calculated with regard for the established characteristics of the glass transition: heat capacity C-P degrees(T), enthalpy H degrees(T) - H-l degrees(0), entropy S degrees(T) - S-l degrees(0) and Gibbs energy G degrees(T) - H-l degrees(0) in the region T -> 0 to 750 K in the glassy and "supercooled liquid" states. For these glasses, the glass transition temperatures (T-g) ranged from 620 to 655 K increasing with increasing S content. The linear expansion coefficients were measured at room temperature and the average value was (15 +/- 0.225).10(-6) K-1. The use of parametric similarity of properties in the framework of the model statistical approach makes it possible to predict the STF for unexplored glasses of this series. The standard enthalpies of glass formation for each composition were calculated using the valence-state (VSM) model, and the valence-orbital characteristics of Ge, S, and Bi atoms were calculated which made it possible to determine the dependence of the charge distribution on these atoms on the sulfur content of the glass composition.

AB As it is known, the glass forming ability of Zr-based alloys is very sensitive to oxygen content. Oxygen contamination may come from raw zirconium and from alloy preparation stages as well. This work was focused on both factors. Using inert gas fusion method authors measured oxygen content in the zirconium delivered by five different providers as well as in five cone-shaped ingots after a full preparation process. Oxygen level influence on the critical diameter of Zr(48)Cu(36)A(19)Ag(7) alloy was quantitatively determined by cone test. Several common thermal indicators using characteristic temperatures were also calculated. They mostly exhibited high sensitivity to oxygen level as their correlation with the critical diameter was very high. Obtained results revealed that zirconium purity is not a relevant parameter in its quality description. The main GFA influencing factor is oxygen contamination level which should never be neglected. Moreover, an in-depth analysis including cost/quality aspects has been conducted in order to obtain practical guidelines for Zr-based bulk metallic glasses preparation.

AB Magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) experiments on network formers of Si-29, Al-22 and B-11 were performed to determine the network connectivity of the quenched glasses. The viscosity and electrical resistivity of alkali-free boro-aluminosilicate glasses were measured at high temperatures, and this temperature dependence of both the two properties were well described by Arrhenius relation. The Mauro-Yue-Ellison-Gupta-Allan (MYEGA) equation was employed to study the viscosity and fragility of glass melts from glass transition temperature to melting temperature. With increasing in the RO substitution for the Al2O3 from 13.5 to 19.5 mol %, the melting temperature of glasses decreased from 1630.4 to 1532.6 degrees C, the fragility index in increased from 22.6 to 24.0 and the resistivity at 1600 degrees C decreased from 52.3 to 28.9 Omega.cm. It was mainly corresponding to the depolymerization of network connectivity. The NMR results showed that the number of Q(4) units decreased from 27.4 to 21.1% and the value of the non-briding oxygen per tetrahedral cation (NBO/T) increased from 0.482 to 0.744. The four-fold coordinated aluminum always predominated in Al groups, and the relative fraction of [BO4] in B groups increased from 5.1% to 16.4%. It cannot be ignored that most of boron kept in [BO3] group even when the ratio of RO/(B2O3 + Al2O3) > 1, which is large different from that in alkali aluminoborosilicate glasses. It is associated with the higher field strength of alkali-earth cations who prefer to form NBO rather than [BO4].

AB Isothermal annealing can enhance the soft magnetic properties of Fe-based metallic glasses, but usually causes brittleness. In this work, we studied the relaxation kinetics of Fe-based metallic glasses below glass transition temperature and the evolution of soft magnetic properties and plasticity. We found that the metallic glass first experiences secondary (beta) relaxation and then transforms into primary (alpha) relaxation upon isothermal annealing. The magnetic properties are enhanced predominantly during beta relaxation stage but don't change very much during alpha relaxation stage. The plasticity doesn't change very much during beta relaxation stage but gets deteriorated during alpha relaxation stage. The structural origin of the changes is also studied. These results prove that it is probable to achieve metallic glasses with both excellent soft magnetic properties and excellent mechanical properties by controlling the relaxation process, which may provide a universal protocol for enhancing the functional performance of soft magnetic metallic glasses.

AB In the present research work, six glasses with chemical mode (10ZnO-40 B2O3-(50-x) Pb3O4-xCuO), where 0 <= x <= 7.5 wt% have been synthesized by solid state reaction method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements have been achieved to check the amorphous nature of these glasses. UV-visible measurements were performed, the optical energy band gap (E-gap(ASF)) and refractive index (n) were determined using the absorption spectrum fitting method (ASF). E-gap(ASF) values were in the range of 2.54-1.24 eV, while (n) in the range of 2.53 to 1.17. Densities (rho) of the synthesized glasses were measured, and molar volume (M-v) were evaluated. The radiation shielding features like; mass attenuation coefficients (mu/rho), effective atomic number (Z(eff)), half value layer (HVL), mean free path (MFP) for the glasses were evaluated using XCOM and MCNPX general purpose Monte Carlo code in the energy range 0.015-10 MeV and compared with some different types of glasses. Results reflected that the (mu/rho) of the studied glasses decreased with the ratio of CuO increased. ZBPC0 glass has the highest Z(eff) whereas ZBPC7.5 glass has the lowest. The glass ZBPC7.5 has the highest HVL and MFP values while ZBPC0 glass has the lowest. One can conclude that ZBPC0 has superior gamma radiation shielding effectiveness among the synthesized glasses.

AB Zinc-phosphate glasses doped with different concentrations of Nd3+ ions have been prepared by the melt quenching technique and characterized the spectroscopic properties. The physical properties by means of density and molar volume are determined. The amorphous nature of the glasses has been confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. FTIR spectra exhibited the fundamental stretching vibrations modes of glass network. In order to study the spectroscopic properties of fabricated glasses, absorption and emission spectroscopy has been performed. Additionally, the spectroscopic properties of Nd3+ ions were analyzed using J-O theory. UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of glass samples divulged twelve significant peaks. Considerable enhancement of Omega(2) values with increasing neodymium content indicated an improvement in the covalency and asymmetry of Nd3+ ions environment. Under the excitation of 808 nm laser diode, two near-infrared emission bands at around 890 and 1060 nm from F-4(3/2) -> I-4(9/2) and I-4(11/2) radiative transitions respectively were observed in the Nd3+ single doped glasses. The major intensity is observed for 1060 nm for such glass samples. Nd3+ ions dopant is found to augment the luminescence intensity by a factor as much as 2.23 times as the concentration of Nd3+ ions increase up to 1.5 mol%. The lifetimes of this level has been experimentally determined through decay profile studies. The developed glass possesses high fluorescence quantum efficiency (eta = 96%). The results indicate that the prepared glass system could be a suitable candidate for using it as laser gain media around 1060 nm, solid-state lasers and fiber amplifiers.

AB In the kinetics of Aluminum Induced Crystallization (AIC) process, the sequence of deposition plays a significant role; specifically, for the hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) films deposited by Hot Wire Chemical Vapour Deposition (HWCVD). We show that while the layer sequence of substrate/a-Si:H/Al crystallizes at a relatively lower temperature of 300 degrees C in 5 min (relatively faster rate), the layer sequence of substrate/Al/a-Si:H takes about 1 h at 450 degrees C for crystallization. We have carried out extensive Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, focused ion beam (FIB) imaging, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES) to first establish the difference in the kinetics of crystallization in these two layer sequences and then to explain the reasons for the same. We put forward a hypothesis followed by a supportive experimental evidence, using FTIR spectroscopy as a tool, that the high hydrogen concentration at the a-Si:H/Al interface slows down the kinetics in AIC.

ID VISCOSITY
AB In a recent article, Zhu et al. suggest that a discrepancy exist between viscosity measurements performed by oscillation viscometry compared to other techniques such as capillary or parallel plate methods. They argue that oscillation viscometry data increasingly deviate with temperature leading to a systematic mismatch at high temperature. They conclude that this discrepancy discredit the existence of most fragile-to-strong transitions (FST) reported recently that are based on this type of measurement. Here we show that when all the data available are taken into account, this argument loses its coherency. Indeed, if FST were an artefact of instrumental error then all liquids measured using oscillation viscometry over the same temperature and viscosity range should exhibit an apparent FST. Instead, data available at high temperature for Se shows no FST but in fact show an excellent match with model prediction over the full temperature range, while data for GeSe3 measured over the same range show a severe kink revealing an FST which therefore cannot be assigned to a mismatch between measurement techniques. Furthermore we show that oscillation viscometry data can be independently corroborated using heat capacity data via the Adam Gibbs equation. Finally we show that large vapor pressure losses occur in Ge-Se glasses at high temperature and are likely responsible for the reported deviation in viscosity measurement. This is not the case of oscillation viscometry measurements that are performed in sealed ampoules. Overall these results confirm the validity of oscillation viscometry as well as the existence of fragile-to-strong transitions.

ID VISCOSITY
AB In a recent study parallel plate and capillary rheometry techniques were employed by us to measure the viscosity of selenium (up to 673 K) and two Ge-Se liquids (up to 823 K) over a temperature range sufficient to suggest that oscillation viscometry may systematically underestimate the viscosity of liquids at high temperatures. Consequently, doubt was cast on the validity of the existence of a fragile-to-strong transition (FST) in glass-forming liquids postulated in the literature on the basis of oscillation viscometry data. The Comment by Lucas questions the accuracy of the viscosity data for Ge-Se liquids in our study on the basis of the observation of significant mass loss due to evaporation of Se from supercooled GeSe3 liquid when heated in a TGA at temperatures >= 823 K. Lucas also reasserts the accuracy of viscosity measured by oscillation viscometry as well as the existence of FST by showing consistency between the viscosity and the configurational entropy of Ge15Te85 liquid, within the framework of the Adam-Gibbs model. We argue that Lucas' understanding of the boundary conditions and the experimental protocols for our viscosity measurements is incorrect and present experimental evidence that indicate the lack of any detectable change in the chemical composition of the Ge-Se liquids during viscosity measurements. We also point out that the recently reported viscosity data for the Ge15Te85 liquid is in fact in disagreement with Lucas' entropy-based calculations. Furthermore, these calculations not only ignore the electronic contribution to specific heat for a semiconductor-to-metal transition in the Ge15Te85 liquid, but more importantly the fact that the Adam-Gibbs model may not be applicable at extremely low viscosity, where the liquid dynamics crosses over from an activated viscous regime to a non-activated fluid regime.

AB The Cenozoic N-S trending Songkhla rift basin, located in the southwest Gulf of Thailand, is a half-graben structure. The boundary fault zone on the western side of the basin is formed from a series of N-S to NNE-SSW, east-dipping normal faults. The Songkhla basin is an example of a predominantly orthogonal extended half graben that developed in phases between the Late Eocene and the early Middle Miocene, and appears to be little affected by pre-existing fabrics. The rift spans two phases of rifting: the Eocene-Oligocene phase that is present in the eastern, and the Oligocene-Miocene phase that is present in the western Gulf of Thailand and onshore areas. 2D and 3D seismic data shows that the tectonic phases within the Songkhla basin are slightly different from the overall regional pattern and comprises: (1) an early rift stage in the Eocene; (2) a late rift stage from Oligocene to Early Miocene (3) a post-rift Middle Miocene stage, possibly with minor inversion; and, (4) continuation of post rift subsidence from the Pliocene to recent. The early rift stage is marked by numerous relatively small extensional faults. Many of these faults became inactive during the later extensional episodes, when extension was focused on the boundary fault system. The region of the boundary fault investigated here is composed of five large segments (F1-F5). During the Eocene, the segments, except for F5, became hard linked, and generally by the end of the Eocene, throw conformed to a coherent model. However, despite the boundary fault segments becoming linked during the Oligocene to Miocene, where extensional throws were relatively low, the throw patterns along the fault zone started to change to an isolated fault model, where several throw highs and lows are present along the fault trace.

AB The tectonic evolution of SE Anatolia is associated with the collision between the Taurides and the Arabian Platform in the early Cenozoic, after the final closure of the southern branch of the Neotethys ocean during Late Cretaceous to Early Eocene times. The ongoing deformation was characterized by northward movement of Arabia, followed by westward extrusion of Anatolia, having been displaced along the northern and eastern Anatolian transform faults. The neotectonic deformation history between the Anatolian Plate and the Arabian platform since the closure of the southern Neotethyan oceanic basin from Late Cretaceous to present has not been studied in detail paleomagnetically. Therefore we carried out a paleomagnetic study of Mesozoic and Cenozoic rocks at 34 localities along the Bitlis-Zagros suture zone in SE Anatolia located in the boundary region between the Taurides and the Arabian platform and delimited by the Dead Sea Fault.
   Paleomagnetic results from the area show clockwise rotations of 35.6 degrees +/- 14.1 degrees and 26.7 degrees +/- 8.0 degrees with respect to the African plate from Upper Jurassic - Lower Cretaceous and Upper Cretaceous limestones, respectively. The paleomagnetic results indicate also an earlier deformation/opening due to the Dead Sea Fault Zone (DSFZ). Farther north on the Tauride Block, counterclockwise rotation of -34.5 degrees +/- 12.5 degrees is recorded by Upper Cretaceous limestones. In the SE of the study area on the northern margin of Arabia, however, smaller counterclockwise rotations of -12.3 degrees +/- 8.3 degrees and 2.5 degrees +/- 10.0 degrees in Late Cretaceous and -12.7 degrees +/- 13.6 degrees in middle Eocene rocks show relative tectonic stability. Middle Miocene rocks close to the suture zone show counterclockwise rotation by about -39.4 degrees +/- 10.9 degrees, while farther away from the suture zone counterclockwise rotations of -21.9 degrees +/- 9.9 degrees and 7.5 degrees +/- 5.8 degrees are observed. Paleolatitudinal motion from south to north from the Late Jurassic to the Present is in concordance with the apparent polar wander path of Eurasia and Africa.

AB Three types of iron ore, including banded ore, hydrothermal-metasomatic ore and earthy hematite ochre occur in Hormuz and Pohl salt diapirs. Primary banded ores of upper Neoproterozoic age contain alternating iron-rich and silica-rich bands, which characterized by the presence of folded hematite-rich bands and glacial diamictite fragments of quartz, dropstone and other clastics. Hematite as specularite and oligist is the major mineral in the iron-rich bands with minor goethite, pyrite, magnetite and rare siderite. Textural relationships between the ore and gangue minerals indicate that these ores are Rapitan-type sedimentary banded iron deposits. This is supported by the geochemical data of iron ores, such as low concentration of Al2O3, TiO2, Ba, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu and other trace elements, plus high value of MnO, Fe/V and Fe/Ti ratios, and REE patterns. Subsequent to the formation of iron ore deposits, an immense thickness of evaporitic rocks was formed in the oceanic marginal basins. Negative delta C-13 and delta C-18 values of the cap carbonates and strong positive delta S-34 values of the underlying sulfates are similar to the isotopic patterns of Ediacaran Rapitan-type iron deposits. Due to salt diapirism in the upper Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras, secondary iron deposits were formed by the activation of hot hydrothermal fluids during salt rising. High contents of some indicative elements such as Sr, Zr, U, Th, Pb, Zn, Sn, W and Mo in the metasomatic iron ores showed that they are the products of iron ore remobilization-redeposition in a hydrothermal system. The nearness of these ores to the fault zones is consistent with the scheme of migration and redeposition of iron compounds as metasomatic deposits under oxidizing conditions. Finally, earthy ochre was formed following the weathering and erosion of pre-existent iron ores.

AB In the Bayan Obo REE deposit in Inner Mongolia, Northern China, three major orebodies are hosted in dolomite marble of the Bayan Obo Group. There are carbonatite dikes in the ore district. Apatite is a common accessary mineral in the ore-hosting dolomite marble (DM apatite) and in carbonatite dikes (IC apatite). These two types of apatite are both fluorapatite, and have low SiO2, uniform P2O5, and variable CaO contents. Total REY (REEs + Y) contents are correlated with Na2O contents, indicating that REY of both types of apatite enter lattice via the substitution reaction: Na+ + (REY)(3+) = 2Ca(2+). These features, combined with high REY (6230-18,906 ppm) and Sr (9653-17,200 ppm) contents of DM apatite, indicate that DM apatite likely had a carbonatite origin. Some DM apatite grains are partially replaced by albite and quartz. Fluid inclusions crosscutting both apatite and albite or quartz indicate that they formed later than quartz and albite replacement. The back-scattered electron images show that DM apatite grains contain many micro-pores (fluid inclusions), and monazite inclusions formed from the fluid inclusions. However, no monazite inclusions are observed within quartz and albite, excluding the possibility that the monazite inclusions were precipitated directly from the fluids. The monazite inclusions were therefore formed during fluid-induced dissolution-reprecipitation processes, where DM apatite served as the source of LREEs. This also explains the depletion of some LREEs in DM apatite. The formation of monazite inclusions in apatite requires fluids with relatively low Na and Si concentrations, different from the fluids responsible for quartz and albite replacement. DM apatite was affected by two stages of fluid activities: the first stage of metasomatism by alkaline fluids that were likely derived from carbonatite magmas when the deposit first formed (represented by quartz and albite replacement), followed by a second stage of modification that caused LREEs depletion and the formation of new REE minerals. Thus, the Bayan Obo REE ore deposit was modified by a significant thermal event after the formation, which provided negligible or only small amounts of REEs.

AB A series of Late Mesozoic A-type granitoids, including the Xiangshan volcanic-intrusive complex, was recently identified along the Gan-Hang volcanic belt, which was close to the boundary of the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks in South China. However, significant issues on the petrogenesis of the Xiangshan complex, especially how mantle-derived magma contributes, if any, still remain controversial. In this study, we focused on the apatite geochemistry of the Xiangshan complex to understand the characteristics and evolution of its primary magma. In the Xiangshan complex, mainly including rhyolite, porphyritic lava, granite porphyry, and quartz monzonite porphyry, apatites occur mostly as inclusions in plagioclase and biotite, and exhibit high Sr-ap (Sr content in apatite)/Sr-hr (Sr content in host rock) (from 0.97 to 3.22, 1.85 on average), indicating these apatites crystalized before plagioclase in the melt. Therefore, the negative Eu anomalies (from 0.06 to 0.83) in apatites of the Xiangshan complex indicate that plagioclase is a remaining stable mineral phase in the source rocks during the partial melting. In addition, most of apatites in the Xiangshan complex with varied whole-rock ASI (aluminum saturation index) values (from 0.88 to 1.19) are characterized by high and relatively homogeneous F content (from 3.14 to 3.55). Therefore, F-rich mineral should be a primary phase in the source. Compared with apatites in three earlier rocks of the complex, apatites from quartz monzonite porphyry have higher Mn and Cl contents, stronger degree of negative Eu anomalies, and lower initial Sr-87/Sr-86 (0.70642-0.70714), suggesting that before apatites crystalized, the magma to form quartz monzonite porphyry had been mixed with a Cl-rich magma derived from a mantle source that received addition of Cl from subducting oceanic sediments of the Paleo-Pacific plate. The Sr isotope ratios and halogens contents of apatite from quenched dark enclaves found in granitic porphyry imply that the enclaves were formed from this Cl-rich mantle-derived magma through injecting part of this magma into the granitic magma and remaining as quenched enclaves without mechanic mixing and no significant chemical influence on the host granitic magma. Thorough mixing between this mantle-derived magma and the felsic crustal magma did not occur until the latest stage of the Xiangshan volcanism when quartz monzonite porphyry was forming.

AB The Yaguila skarn deposit with reserves of 52 Mt at 4% Pb, 2% Zn, and 64.3 g/t Ag is located in the eastern segment of the central Lhasa subterrane, Tibet. The stratabound skarn Pb-Zn-Ag orebodies are hosted in the Upper Carboniferous-Lower Permian Laigu Formation, which consists of meta-quartz sandstone, slate, and marble. Molybdenum occurs as quartz-molybdenite +/- pyrite veinlets, veins, and partial disseminations in the Paleocene quartz porphyry, slate, and garnet skarn. Zircon U-Pb dating suggests that three major magmatic events occurred in the Yaguila area, producing Cretaceous rhyolitic rock (ca. 128 Ma), Paleocene quartz porphyry (65.6 +/- 1.2 Ma), and Miocene granite porphyry (17.8 +/- 0.4 Ma). Combined with the published data, the quartz porphyry has variable epsilon(Hf)(t) values of -13.9 to +12.1, (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) values of 0.71718-0.72805, and epsilon(Nd)(t) values of -5.2 to -13.5, whereas the granite porphyry displays relatively restricted epsilon(Hf)(t) values of +2.3 to + 6.5, (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) values of 0.70798-0.71678, and epsilon(Nd)(t) values of -2.8 to -5.5. Geochemical and isotopic (Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf) signatures indicate that the Cretaceous rhyolitic magma was derived from the melting of continental lower crust of the ancient Lhasa subterrane with a strong fractional crystallization. The emplacement of the Paleocene quartz porphyry probably resulted from the magma mixing process between the dominant Lhasa middle-upper crust-derived magma and varying contributions of mantle-derived materials during the collision and Neo-Tethyan subduction slab rollback. The Miocene granite porphyry was likely formed by the melting of thickened Lhasa lower crust, which was triggered by upwelling of hot asthenosphere. Our molybdenite Re-Os data from garnet skarn, together with published data from quartz porphyry and slate, display an excellent isochron age of 64.3 +/- 1.6 Ma. Fluid inclusion data from this study reveal that the ore-forming fluids associated with diverse types of molybdenum mineralization were a common magmatic-hydrothermal fluid with moderate to high temperatures (290-400 degrees C) and moderate salinities (9-22 wt% NaCl equiv.). Our study suggests that the Yaguila Pb-Zn-Ag and Mo mineralization occurred under the same ore system associated with the Paleocene quartz porphyry.

AB The modem Tian Shan formed due to the India-Eurasia collision. Uplift of the Tian Shan is recorded notably by the sedimentary sequences and subsidence history of the coupling foreland basins. We analyzed a 353-km-long seismic profile and logging data of four wells in the southern Tian Shan foreland area to decipher its tectonic, stratigraphic, and subsidence history. The sedimentary sequences comprise the Cambrian-Silurian, Devonian-Permian, Triassic, Jurassic-Cretaceous, and Paleogene tectonostratigraphic units, overlain by the late Oligocene-Quaternary foreland basin unit. The Jidike Formation is the oldest sedimentary sequence of the foreland succession, deposited at similar to 26 Ma based on magnetostratigraphic constraints, indicating that uplift of the southern Tian Shan was initiated by at least similar to 26 Ma. In addition, the tectonic subsidence rate of the southern Tian Shan foreland basin increased significantly since similar to 26 Ma due to lithospheric flexure caused by building of the topography of the southern Tian Shan. The envelope line of the forelandward onlaping points within the foreland unit indicates that the forebulge of the southern Tian Shan foreland basin migrated southwards at 1.6 +/- 0.1 mm/yr between similar to 26 Ma and similar to 12 Ma and at 14.6 +/- 0.1 mm/yr after similar to 12 Ma. The increase of migration rate at similar to 12 Ma suggests an accelerated convergence between the Tarim Basin and the Tian Shan.

AB Obtaining constraints on the timing of orogenic gold mineralization hosted in shear zones in greenstone belts is often difficult because of the lack of easily datable minerals and problems of overprinting of earlier events of mineralization by later hydrothermal events. In the orogenic Hutti gold deposit the U-Pb SHRIMP date obtained from a monazite grain within arsenopyrite that gave an age of 2547 +/- 10 Ma, is generally accepted as the age of early hydrothermal mineralization. Nevertheless, other work has indicated that hydrothermal mineralization may have occurred in later episodes as well. This study reports new Ar-40-Ar-39 ages for hydrothermal biotite, amphibolite and hornblende in granites that occur along the northern and southeastern boundary of the greenstone belt. The Ar-40-Ar-39 ages of biotite samples are inferred to be the result of re-setting of the ages of alteration biotite by the last phase of hydrothermal activity in this area at similar to 2332 Ma. The study indicates that the effects of the thermal event are more significant in areas of greater hydrothermal access such as within the Hutti shear zone. This late hydrothermal alteration event may be related to the D3 deformational event of Roy (1991). The results of the present work are important because it demonstrates a significant hydrothermal event much after the major 2.58-2.52 Ga accretionary event and accompanying TTG and felsic magmatism in the Eastern Dharwar Craton.

AB The Semirom karst type clayey bauxite is located in the Zagros zone, a part of the Irano-Himalayan belt, and occurs between the Sarvak and Ilam Formations. The Albian to Cenomanian limestone bedrock of the Sarvak Fm is a part of a platform ramp environment including clay bearing components. Diaspore, boehmite, kaolinite, and hematite are the major ore-forming minerals. Elemental mobility determinations reveal that Th and the critical metals Co, Ni, and Cr are enriched in the bauxitic horizons relatively to the Upper Continental Crust. Further, only one sample is outlier for more than one critical metal (Cr, Co, Ni, and Ga) likely recording a specific event during bauxitization. The outlier is enriched in Ni, Co, Ga, and Th, is depleted in Cr, and shows a large positive Ce anomaly (Ce/Ce* = 3.03). The outlier may record an event characterized by more acidic and oxidizing conditions and may have a regional relevance. R-mode factor analysis suggests that Cr and Co are likely adsorbed onto oxy-hydroxides probably in horizons also concentrating secondary phosphates hosting HREE and Th. Nickel is instead likely adsorbed onto titanium oxides which concentrate in the pool of highly insoluble detrital phases also including zircon whereas diaspore and boehmite are important in controlling both Ga and LREE. The low contents of Ni and Cr associated to the Semirom clayey bauxite exclude a provenance from a mafic protolith. Further, most of the samples have Eu/Eu* values close to those observed in the Sarvak Fm marly limestone, suggesting that the clayey component within the underlying limestone acted as protolith. The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of the kaolinite-rich separates from the Semirom deposit indicates temperature never lower than 30 degrees C, supporting the idea of the Zagros basin close to the equator during the Cenomanian-Turonian under a warm and humid tropical climate with heavy rainfall.

TI Diagenesis, burial history, and hydrocarbon potential of Cambrian

AB Undeformed Cambrian-Ordovician sandstones on the northern margin of Gondwana are in places important hydrocarbon reservoirs. The factors that favoured diagenetic preservation of porosity in such sandstones are reviewed and compared to the Lower Cambrian Lalun Formation of central Iran, in order to assess what aspects of geological history have controlled the cementation and porosity of the sandstones. The Lalun Formation is up to 640 m thick and comprises braided-fluvial sandstones with minor shales that are overlain by marine shales, sandstones and carbonates. In four sections along a 650 km traverse, the sandstones are predominantly quartzarenites, locally arkosic and lithic, and contain minimal detrital matrix. Provenance analysis and paleo-flow suggest derivation from the Arabian Shield. Diagenesis was dominated by quartz overgrowths and abundant infra-grain microfractures healed by silica cement, with modest amounts of poikilotopic and mosaic calcite, authigenic clay, and iron oxide as early grain rims and late-stage fracture fills. Minor phases include dolomite, ankerite, siderite, magnetite and barite. Marine strata contain more carbonate cement, with silica cement prominent in topmost nearshore sandstones. Burial-history analysis suggests relatively rapid burial in a cratonic setting to more than 4 km by the end of the Silurian and a maximum temperature of similar to 150 degrees C during burial diagenesis, sufficient for hydrocarbon generation by the end of the Paleozoic. Dissolution of K-feldspar, ferro-magnesian grains and, locally, calcite cement generated secondary porosity, but porosity and permeability values are low, averaging 1.5% and < 0.1 mD, respectively. Rapid subsidence of thick Cambrian fluvial successions at the northeastern Gondwanan margin may have limited early dissolution and promoted occlusion of primary porosity by quartz overgrowths, limiting permeability pathways for fluids that might have generated secondary porosity later in the basinal history. In contrast with Cambrian and Ordovician sandstone reservoirs across North Africa and the Middle East, the existence of Paleozoic source rocks may be problematic in central Iran.

AB This study describes the field relationships, petrography and geochemistry of various metamorphic and magmatic rocks from the Barru Block, South Sulawesi, Indonesia, and reports Rb-Sr isochron ages for clastic metasedimentary rocks. The Barns Block is composed of a tectonic stack of various lithological units, including cherts, radiolarian mudstone, breccias, shales, phyllites, mica schist, gneisses, amphibolite and ultramafic rocks. Dacitic rocks intrude the metamorphic and ultramafic sequences. Greenschist- to amphibolite-facies metasedimentary rocks represent detritus from nearby continental blocks that have been redistributed by turbidity currents. Quartzofeldspathic gneisses are derived from andesitic and dacitic protoliths, whereas amphibolites have basaltic precursors. The clastic metasedimentary rocks show enrichment in LILE and HFSE, particularly Nb, but depletion in Sr. The amphibolites display trace element patterns typical of N-MORB rocks, whereas compositional characteristics of gneisses and dacites suggest that they originated in an arc-related environment.
   Geothermobarometric calculations and mineral assemblages of greenschist facies-rocks suggest metamorphic equilibration at 250-300 degrees C and a maximum pressure of 5 kbar. Temperature estimates for amphibolites are 640 +/- 20 degrees C at a pressure of 1.3-3 kbar, whereas the temperature estimates for quartzofeldspathic gneisses range from ca. 630-660 degrees C for peak conditions to 430-520 degrees C for the retrograde stage. Internal Rb-Sr mineral isochrons for three medium-pressure mica schists indicate metamorphic ages of ca. 70.7 +/- 2.4 Ma, 107.3 +/- 0.7 Ma and 110 +/- 2.4 Ma, respectively. This age range confirms the importance of Early Cretaceous (Albian) metamorphism within the region, but also indicates a previously unknown Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) metamorphic or deformational event at ca. 70 Ma.
   The Barru rocks show a range of tectonic environments as diverse as that of the adjacent Bantimala Block, but overall, the Barru rock association is more felsic in composition. Although the two blocks accreted approximately at the same time (Early Cretaceous), differences in protoliths, geochemistry and metamorphic P-T conditions imply that they were not geographically close together at that time, but were subsequently juxtaposed tectonically.

AB The Lenglongling Fault (LLLF) is located in the western section of the "Tianzhu seismic gap" along the Qilian-Haiyuan fault zone in the NE Tibetan Plateau, between the 1920 M8.5 Haiyuan and the 1927 M8.0 Gulang earthquakes. There is little information about the paleoseismic history of the LLLF and understanding the faulting history of the LLLF is important for determining the seismic hazards of both the fault and the seismic gap. Using UAV-based photogrammetry, high-resolution satellite imagery, and field investigations, we mapped the surface trace of the fault in detail and measured 192 left-lateral offsets of geomorphic markers along the fault trace. A binned cumulative offset probability density (COPD) distribution was calculated to analyze single-event and multi-event cumulative offsets. As a result, we find that the LLLF has fresh scarps along the entire similar to 120 km length, indicating that the most recent event might have ruptured the full-segment of the fault. The coseismic offset of the most recent event changes along the fault trace and has an asymmetrical bell-shaped distribution. The maximum offset was similar to 7 m, located in the middle-eastern section of the fault, and the offset decreases progressively towards both ends. The minimum offset, located at the western end, was similar to 3.0 m, and the average coseismic offset was similar to 4.8 m. The cumulative offsets of the four most recent paleoearthquakes are multiples of the coseismic offset of the most recent event, and show similar slip distributions, indicating that the fault ruptures with a characteristic slip. The fault slip distribution, estimated recurrence interval, and estimated moment magnitude imply that the LLLF releases accumulated strain energy mainly by repeatedly producing Mw 7.5-7.8 earthquakes every 1000 +/- 200 years. We also show that the binned COPD technique performs well to separate single-event and multi-event cumulative offsets.

AB The Ban Pong Basin (BPB) is a small intermontane basin of Neogene age on the western margin of the Chiang Mai Basin in northern Thailand. The BPS was discovered in 2012 because of new quarrying activity. The basin complex formed in the hanging wall of a major Cenozoic low-angle normal fault (LANE) called the Inthanon Detachment, and provides a unique record of the Neogene deformation related to the detachment. The BPB's preservation is probably due to its location in a synform within the rising Western Ranges metamorphic complex, which forms the Suthep-Inthanon mountain range. Initially, extensional faults in the BPB were oriented similar to N-S but then rotated to NNW-SSE, NW-SE, and ENE-WSW to NE-SW directions, which we interpret as arising due to local stress rotation related to the adjacent rising metamorphic complex. Folds, thrusts, and inverted normal faults both within Neogene sediments of the Mae Rim Formation and adjacent Palaeozoic metasedimentary rocks indicate a phase of compression that affected the basin late in its history (probably latest Miocene-Pliocene based on the regional timing of inversion). Complete Bouguer anomaly interpretations of 235 reduced gravity stations reveal two en echelon sub-basins, bounded by gravity highs related to shallow-lying Palaeozoic rocks and underlying high-grade metamorphic basement rocks. Two gravity-density cross-section models indicate the basin fill comprises up to 250 m of weakly lithified syn-rift sediments. The absence of a classic half graben morphology is probably related to inversion and erosion that significantly modified the extensional basin geometry and original thickness.

TI No plate tectonic shutdown in the early Paleoproterozoic: Constraints

AB The global plate tectonic regime in the early Paleoproterozoic period is highly debated. Granitoids bear key information to address such a debate. Petrological, geochemical and geochronological studies are conducted on two post-collisional granitoid plutons in the Quanji Massif, northwestern China, to investigate the tectonic regime during this period. The granitoids are composed of syenogranite, monzogranite, and granodiorite, with minor tonalite, which intruded into the Delingha and Hudesheng regions at ca. 2.39-2.37 Ga. These plutons are high-K I-type granitoids with variable Ga/Al ratios, showing some characteristics of A(2)-type granitoids. They are characterized by enrichment of LILEs and LREEs and depletion of Sr, P, Ti, and Eu. They show depleted Nd and Hf isotope signatures with whole rock epsilon(Nd)(t) = +0.7 to +4.8 and zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) = -1.0 to +7.8, indicating a juvenile crustal growth event at ca. 2.44-2.37 Ga. Our new results together with other coeval post-collisional granitoids in the Quanji Massif suggest that the protracted post-collisional magmatism at ca. 2.39-2.34 Ga occurred just after a short interval of subduction and generation of juvenile magmas before or around ca. 2.4 Ga. Collectively, the formation of these ca. 2.4-2.3 Ga granitoids in the Quanji Massif may correlate with coeval granitoids in the Tarim and North China cratons, and is broadly coeval with magmatism in several other cratons in the West African and Canadian Shields. Thus, the globally well-documented magmatism at early Paleoproterozoic, or Siderian, provides further information for filling up the age gap of the so-called plate tectonic "shutdown" in the early Paleoproterozoic period worldwide. The geologic record therefore suggests no Siderian shutdown of plate tectonics, but instead, continuous global subduction and generation of juvenile magmas from the Archean through the Paleoproterozoic.

AB Greenland Interstadial 21 (GIS 21), one of the longest warm episodes during the last glacial period, occurred at the transition from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5a to 4. Precise determination of the timing and duration of this interstadial can improve our understanding of the hydroclimatic connection between low and high latitudes across this MIS boundary. delta O-18 records of two stalagmites from Sanxing Cave, Southwest China, provide a subdecadally resolved record of Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) evolution from 79.0 +/- 0.2 to 75.7 +/- 0.2 thousand years before present (kyr BP, before 1950 CE) revealing the detailed structure of the Chinese Interstadial 21 (CIS 21). The replicate Sanxing record, for the first time, captures three centennial-scale intervals of strong monsoon and a 700-yr-long weak monsoon period within the CIS 21 "rebound-type" event, concurrent with its counterpart GIS 21. This synchronicity between SW China and Greenland suggests a rapid atmospheric teleconnection between the North Atlantic and the ASM region. Marked by similar to 400 yr-long decrease in ASM, CIS 21 ended at 76.8 +/- 0.2 kyr BP, which is 0.5-1.0 kyr younger than the corresponding termination of GIS 21 on AICC2012 and GICCO5modelext timescales. Given its high accuracy and precision, the Sanxing stalagmite chronology can serve as a benchmark for chronological refinements for ice-core records.

AB Geometry and kinematics of a hitherto ignored crustal scale tectonic discontinuity from the west-central sector of the Himalaya, viz. the North Almora Fault (NAF) is discussed in this paper. Choice of the tectonic model for response of the Himalayan-South Tibetan ensemble to the Tertiary Himalayan continental collision is largely dictated inter alia by the geometry and kinematics of the large orogen parallel strike slip faults in the region. Based on field, laboratory and satellite imagery data, it is concluded that the North Almora Fault/Thrust is not one but two closely parallel tectonic discontinuities viz. (i) the North Almora Fault, a steep south dipping high angle brittle fault with a dominant east slip and subordinate dip slip component and (ii) the North Almora Thrust, a low angle south dipping thrust marking the northern boundary of the large Almora - Jajarkot Nappe. The > 500 km long dextral strike slip North Almora Fault mimicking the similar to 800 km long Karakoram Fault is responsible for significant strain partitioning in the west-central Lesser Himalaya. The North Almora Fault assumes special salience for the Himalayan tectonics as it partitions sizable strains in addition to the Karakoram Fault in the region and lends support to the oblique convergence model that best describes the Himalayan extensional and strike slip deformation.

AB The Cataldag Metamorphic Core Complex (CMCC) consists of the Latest Eocene-Early Oligocene (34-32 Ma) Turfaldag gneiss-migmatite complex (TGMC) and an Early Miocene (21 Ma) Cataldag synkinematic pluton (CSP) which were exhumed as a dome-shaped core complex in the footwall of the Cataldag Detachment Fault Zone (CDFZ) in the Early Miocene. Microstructural features of the cataldag Metamorphic Core Complex (CMCC) and a two-feldspar geothermometry were studied to understand the cooling and deformation mechanisms. Microtectonic analyses of the TGMC and CSP show that the quartz, feldspar, and mica minerals underwent continuous deformation from ductile to brittle conditions during cooling of the CMCC. Two main deformation zones were determined according to temperature and strain intensity: a ductile deformation zone (DZ) within the central zones of the TGMC and CSP, and a mylonitic zone (MZ) within the peripheral zones of the TGMC and CSP (close to the CDFZ). Within the ductile zone, K-feldspar displays microcline twinning, myrmekite along the K-feldspar megacryst and flame-shaped perthite, and quartz displays chessboard extinction, grain boundary migration, and sub-grain rotation recrystallisation. These microstructures indicate that deformation temperature reached about 600 degrees C. Under high strain intensity along the CDFZ, the DZ microstructures turn to MZ microstructures. In the MZ, protomylonitic gneiss and mylonitic schists show distinct foliation and their K-feldspar and micas display C-S structures. The feldspars show bulging recrystallisation, a feldspar-fish structure, and domino type microfractures, while the quartz displays ribbon structures, indicating ductile-to-brittle deformation with temperatures ranging from 500 degrees C to < 250 degrees C. Two-feldspar geothermometry yields deformation temperatures in the DZ of 501-588 degrees C (an average of 544 degrees C for the CSP and an average of 517 degrees C for the TGMC) consistent with the temperature estimated by the microstructural analysis. The mylonitic zone has lower deformation temperature values of 430-557 degrees C (an average of 484 degrees C for CSP and an average of 436 degrees C for TGMC). Thermochronology data display TGMC was cooled slowly (< 50 degrees C/my) throughout the Eo-Oligocene and rapidly (> 500 degrees C/my) along the CDFZ in the Early Miocene (21 Ma). The shear zone-controlled cSP was emplaced into shallow levels of the Anatolian extending crust, deformed progressively (ductile-to-brittle) along the CDFZ, and cooled rapidly (> 500 degrees C/my) in the Early Miocene (21 Ma). Together, the microstructure, two-feldspar geothermometry and thermochronology data indicate that the TGMC and CSP, which were emplaced into different crustal levels and in different periods, suffered continuous ductile-to-brittle deformation and were exhumed together along the CDFZ during the Early Miocene under the N-S extensional regime in western Anatolia.

AB The Sumdo metamorphic belt, located in the Lhasa terrane of Tibet, is a key area for unraveling the Paleo-Tethys evolution. In order to identify the fluid evolution in oceanic subduction zones, eclogite from the Sumdo metamorphic belt, has been investigated in a combined study of petrography, mineral chemistry, fluid inclusions and oxygen isotopes. On the basis of petrography and mineral chemistry, two kinds of garnet were distinguished. The core part of Grt-I shows increasing grossular content and contains prograde mineral inclusions, suggesting that it grew during prograde metamorphism, while the rim of Grt-I shows varying grossular and pyrope contents, representing subsequent overgrowth. Grt-II displays a composition comparable with the outermost part of Grt-I, indicating that Grt-II grew at the peak or initial retrograde stage. Garnet trace element zoning patterns and P-T estimates suggest that the Sumdo eclogite experienced a heating stage during an initial exhumation after the peak metamorphic event.
   Based on textural criteria and host minerals, three types of fluid inclusions were distinguished: Type-I are primary NaCl dominated intermediate to high-salinity (10-22 wt% NaCl) fluid inclusions hosted by omphacite, which were most likely released during dehydration of the subducting oceanic crust and reflect the composition of eclogite-facies fluids; Type-II are defined as primary low-salinity (1-6 wt% NaCl) fluid inclusions hosted by epidote/clinozoisite, representing fluids that evolved towards low-salinity during uplift; Type-III are secondary low-salinity (0-7 wt% NaCl) fluid inclusions hosted by matrix quartz (i.e., minerals other than the mineral inclusions) and rarely by omphacite and must have formed at a very late stage. In addition, the eclogite displays delta O-18 values (delta O-18 = +5.0 to +8.9%o) similar to its protolith, low-temperature altered oceanic crust (delta O-18 = +4.9 to +12.7960). The equilibrium oxygen isotope fractionations (Delta O-18(Qtz-Min)) between quartz and garnet/omphacite suggest isotopic equilibrium and a closed fluid system during eclogite facies metamorphism. Our data indicate that the Sumdo eclogite experienced "hot" exhumation, during which large amounts of fluids were released by dehydration. Fluids in the Sumdo eclogite were typically aqueous fluids of varying salinities and now preserved as fluid inclusions in HP metamorphic minerals. In comparison with continental subduction zones, we confirm previous conclusion that the fluid regime in oceanic subduction zones is relatively simple (i.e. mainly NaCl bearing brines) with seawater-altered slabs as the dominant source.

AB The Tongchanggou porphyry Mo-Cu deposit is located within the Zhongdian Arc of the southern Yidun Terrane of SE Tibet and is a typical porphyry deposit formed in a post-collisional setting. However, the geodynamic and ore-forming processes that controlled the formation of the deposit remain poorly understood, primarily as a result of a lack of systematic research on the petrogenetic and mineralizing processes. This study presents new whole-rock geochemical, geochronological, zircon trace element and Hf isotopic, and molybdenite Re-Os isotopic data for the Tongchanggou porphyry Mo-Cu deposit, and uses these data to discuss the petrogenesis of the granites, ore-forming processes that generated the deposit, geodynamic setting of the deposit, and broad-erimplications for the genesis of post-collisional mineralization. The zircon U-Pb and molybdenite Re-Os data indicate that the Tongchanggou porphyry Mo-Cu mineralization formed during the Late Cretaceous (82.9-84.3 Ma), contemporaneous with the formation of the Xiuwacu Mo-W, Relin Mo-W-Cu, and Hongshan Cu deposits elsewhere in the Zhongdian Arc. The Tongchanggou porphyry intrusions are weakly peraluminous to metaluminous I-type granites, that are high-K and calc-alkaline seriers, show subduction signatures and adakitic affinity. They have low epsilon(Hf)(t) (-8.1 to 1.7) and ancient two-stage Hf model ages (T(DM)2: 1.11-1.47 Ga). These features indicate that the magmas that formed the Tongchanggou porphyry intrusions were derived from a subduction-modified mantle wedge and overthickened ancient lower crustal material. The mixing of these mantle-derived Cu-rich and crust-derived Mo-rich melts would have generated high magmatic oxygen fugacity conditions and hydrous magmas, both of which are critical for the formation of this type of porphyry mineralization. These parental magmas attained highMo/Cu values as after the significant crystallization process during magma ascent, a process that led to the formation of the Tongchanggou Mo-Cu deposit. This study demonstrates that post-collisional porphyry deposits generally formed during a rapid tectonic change from compressional to extensional setting and changing tectonic regimes may be key for the formation of this type of deposits.

AB The Hongyuntan magnetite deposit, which is located in the Aqishan-Yamansu belt of Eastern Tianshan, Xinjiang, is hosted within Carboniferous submarine volcanic-sedimentary sequences. The deposit is characterized by five metallogenic stages: Stage I (garnet-diopside), Stage II (magnetite-tremolite-chlorite-pyrite), Stage III (magnetite-quartz-albite-actinolite), Stage IV (pyrite-quartz-epidote) and Stage V (hematite-limonite). Pyrite associated with magnetite formed during the Stage II has a Re-Os isochron age of 324 +/- 31 Ma. Four types of fluid inclusions were observed in the mineral assemblages, namely, two-phase liquid and vapor inclusions, multi-phase daughter mineral-bearing inclusions, multi-phase CO2-bearing inclusions, and monophase vapor inclusions. Microthermometry data reveal that the ore-forming fluids evolved from high-temperature (average 532.5 degrees C) and high-salinity (average 26.9 wt% NaCleqv) fluids to moderate-low-temperature (average 203.6 degrees C) and low-salinity (5.07 wt% NaCleqv) fluids. Magnetite precipitation may have been greatly assisted by mixing and boiling in Stage II and Stage III, respectively. The hydrogen and oxygen isotopic values of Stage I garnet (delta DV-SMOW = -107.9 parts per thousand to -76.7 parts per thousand, delta O-18(fluid) = 6.4-10.7 parts per thousand) and Stage III quartz (delta DV-SMOW = -85.5 parts per thousand to -83.2 parts per thousand, delta O-18(fluid) = 3.8-4.7 parts per thousand) indicate that the ore-forming fluids were dominated by magmatic water, whereas fluid mixing occurred during Stage II (delta DV-SMOW = -117.3 parts per thousand to -112.6 parts per thousand, delta(18)Ofluid = 3.3-5.7 parts per thousand) and Stage IV (delta DV-SMOW = -115.2 parts per thousand to -58.5 parts per thousand, delta O-18(fluid) = -1.3 parts per thousand to 4.5 parts per thousand). The variable delta S-34 values of pyrite (-3.8 parts per thousand to 4.7 parts per thousand) and delta O-18(mgt) values of magnetite (-0.6 parts per thousand to 4.1 parts per thousand) suggest that they were not sourced from a single reservoir.
   The Hongyuntan magnetite deposit is spatially and temporally associated with volcanism and may be genetically related to it. The fluid inclusions and isotopic compositions of this deposit indicate that its ore-forming fluid was derived from the exsolution of deep-seated magmas and that fluid mixing could have effectively triggered the deposition of ore-forming materials. Multiple periods of volcanic activity could have incorporated additional heat and ore metals into the ore-forming system. Based on our data, we conclude that the origin of the Hongyuntan magnetite deposit is related to the volcanism in the Carboniferous period.

AB Multi-proxy records of paleoclimate changes spanning the past 30 cal ka BP were obtained from Qionghai Lake sediment core, Sichuan Province, southwest China, where southwest summer monsoon prevails. The core was studied for molecular compositions of n-alkanes, stable carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13) of organic matter (OM), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and trace elements. Evidence from n-alkanes, cross chart of C/N-delta C-13 values and trace elements indicated the organic matter derived from a mixed source composed of autochthonous aquatic organisms and allochthonous terrestrial plants, and the sediments mainly deposited in reducing conditions, which is in favor of preservation and accumulation of OM. Variations of n-alkanes biomarker proxies, delta C-13 of organic matter and Mo concentrations reflected three stages of paleoclimate evolution during the past 30 cal ka BP: a relatively warm and humid climate between 29.1 and 22.9 cal ka BP, corresponding to a strong southwest summer monsoon; climate shifted towards cold and dry condition during the period of 22.9-15.7 cal ka BP, in response to the reduced insolation and weakened southwest summer monsoon; temperature and humidity gradually increased in the Holocene with fluctuations, broadly track the strengthening trend of southwest summer monsoon. Our findings further confirm that variations in solar activity may primarily affect the strength of southwest summer monsoon, resulting in the shifts of paleoclimate conditions. Further studies are needed to better constrain the detailed forcing drivers which may amplify the intensity of southwest summer monsoon particularly in the Holocene period.

AB The deeply buried Cambrian-Lower Ordovician carbonates in the western and central Tarim Basin were extensively dolomitized in the course of their diagenetic history. Petrographic, geochemical (O-C-Sr-isotopes and trace elements) and fluid inclusion studies have been used in this study to elucidate the origins of the ancient massive dolomites. Based on detailed examination, dolomicrite and microbial (or algal)-laminated dolomites (DML) and three types of crystalline dolomites (fine-crystalline, nonplanar-a(s), dolomite (RD1), fine- to medium-crystalline, planar-e (s) dolomite (RD2), and medium- to coarse-crystalline, nonplanar-a dolomite (RD3)) are identified. Nonplanar-a dolomite (saddle) cement (CD), and early and later-stage calcite cement as vug/fracture infills are identified. Most samples of DML still possess relics of algal stromatolitic and anhydritc sediment fabrics, common in Sabkha dolomites formed during penecontemporaneous supratidal dolomitization. The occurrence of RD1 and RD2 along low-amplitude stylolites in most samples indicates that their formation was somewhat linked with pressure dissolution by which minor Mg ions were probably released for replacive dolomitization during early shallow-burial dolomitization. Moreover, the curved crystal faces and the tightly packed crystals of RD2 and RD3 with irregular overgrowth rims and increasing crystal sizes may have resulted from the recrystallization and replacement upon the RD1 and/or from the cortical overgrowth and dissolution of remaining precursor limestones by the influx of dolomitizing fluids during late shallow-burial dolomitization. The average range of the homogenization temperatures (T-h) of CD dolomites is 87.1 degrees C to 161.5 degrees C, mostly lower than the estimated ambient temperature (60 degrees C to 240 degrees C) for the Cambrian-Lower Ordovician strata, implying that the growth of the CD dolomites in the study area was of 'geothermal' origin during late shallow to deep burial dolomitization. The large overlap of delta O-18, delta C-13 and Sr-87/Sr-86 values of RD2, RD3 and CD dolomite suggest that the dolomitizing fluids that precipitated the dolomite cement apparently inherited the composition of the remnant saline connate seawater preserved in host limestones/dolomites and siliciclastics in the Terreneuvian to Cambrian Series 3 strata through fluid-rock interaction. The conceptual model to explain tectonic influence on dolomitizing fluid flows show that faults, fractures and permeable horizons which evolved from a strong tensional-compressional tectonic during the Late Hercynian orogeny in this basin effectively provided conduits through which extensive cross-formational and ascending higher-temperature saline-rich dolomitizing fluids were driven by thermal convective-advective circulation due to geothermal variation, forming irregular networks of dolomites, CD dolomite and calcite cements in the host carbonate rocks.

AB This study presents new Ar-40/Ar-39 ages from across the Himalaya in east-central Nepal. Ar-40/Ar-39 ages from the Mahabharat region, the southernmost and structurally lowest part of the study area, range between 27.5 and 17.3 Ma while those from the High Himalaya, the northernmost, and structurally highest part of the study area range from 17.7 to 17.4 Ma. These two areas bracket a middle portion characterized by younger ages that range between 8.6 and 14.3 Ma, and cluster around similar to 10 Ma. These new dates outline a 'U-shaped' pattern across the region that is interpreted to reflect cooling facilitated by out-of-sequence motion across the Upper Tama Kosi Thrust, in agreement with previous work in the area. The results presented herein are also consistent with published model cooling predictions and highlight the potential importance of late, lower temperature deformation on the present geometries of the exhumed, former metamorphic core exposed mountain belts around the globe.

AB In this paper we present new detrital zircon U-Pb ages and Lu-Hf isotopic data as well as whole-rock geo-chemical data for siltstones of the Cambrian Chergilen and Allin formations in the Mel'gin Trough of the Bureya Massif, Russia. Our aim is to constrain the provenance and tectonic settings of these strata. The detrital zircons in these rocks are dominantly Neoproterozoic in age (similar to 80% of all zircons), along with some Mesoproterozoic and Paleoproterozoic zircons, and the main age peaks are at ca. 1.78, 1.64, 1.45, 1.18, 0.94, and 0.82 Ga. The zircon Hf and whole-rock Sm-Nd isotopic compositions, together with geochronological data, show that the main sources of the Cambrian sediments were Neoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic igneous complexes formed by the reworking of Paleoproterozoic rocks. The main age populations of detrital zircons from the Cambrian siltstones in the Bureya Massif are similar to those of detrital zircons from the Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic deposits within the Jiamusi Massif, suggesting that they share a common history. However, the crustal basements of the Bureya and Jiamusi massifs are different from those of other massifs in the eastern part of the CAOB, such as the Erguna, Khanka, Khingan, and Songnen-Zhangguangcai Range massifs. The wide Neoproterozoic magmatic events suggest that the Bureya and Jiamusi massifs have an affinity to the Tarim Craton or the northern Tian Shan block, different from the North Asian and North China cratons.

AB The NE- to NNE-striking, continental-scale Tan-Lu Fault Zone (TLFZ) in NE China is subdivided into the similar to 900 km long Yilan-Yitong Fault (YYF) in the west and the similar to 1000 km long Dunhua-Mishan Fault (DMF) in the east. Both faults record sinistral displacement during the earliest Cretaceous, leading to an obvious offset of the boundary between the Liaoyuan Accretionary Belt (LAB) and the North China Craton (NCC). Previous studies have demonstrated that the LAB in the south of the eastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) extends eastwards into an area between the YYF and the DMF. The boundaries between the LAB and NCC indicate a 35 km sinistral displacement upon the YYF. However, it remains unclear whether the LAB extends to the east of the DMF, and the amount of sinistral displacement on the DMF is poorly constrained. Here we present lithological observations and U-Pb and Hf isotopic data from zircon to constrain the age and position of the LAB to the east of the DMF. The data indicate an eastward extension of the LAB across the DMF, suggesting the continuous presence of the LAB east of the TLFZ in NE China. The U-Pb ages, epsilon(Hf)(t) values, and two-stage model ages of zircons from the study area constrain the boundary between the LAB and NCC to an extension of the NE-dipping Chifeng-Kaiyuan Fault to the east of the DMF. The geological boundaries on both sides of the DMF indicate a 170 km sinistral displacement along the fault. Thus, the TLFZ has a total sinistral displacement of 205 km in NE China. The eastern branch of the TLFZ records significantly more movement due to its proximity to the Pacific Ocean, where subduction of oceanic crust might have caused sinistral faulting along the TLFZ.

AB This study has documented two kinds of xenotime overgrowths from the Cryogenian-Ediacaran sedimentary rocks in South China. The identical tetragonal dipyramidal structures prompted one type of xenotime to overgrow detrital zircon grains, whereas the other type coexists with rutile crystals. SIMS Pb-Pb, NanoSIMS, EPMA, and TEM imaging analyses suggest these xenotime overgrowths, together with their rutile substrate could be of hydrothermal origin; formed by means of percolating fluids leaching ilmenite and REE(Y) bearing silicate minerals. Iron, Ti, and REE(Y) ions leached in this way were combined with O, S, and P anions to precipitate rutile, xenotime, iron oxides, and pyrite in other pore spaces. Such fluid induced activities were probably induced by the ca. 460-390 Ma Wuyi-Yunkai Orogeny in South China. The most important finding is that the rutile-xenotime assemblage was precipitated almost simultaneously, rendering a dissolution-reprecipitation process impossible. Absence of dissolution margins on detrital zircons suggest detrital Fe-Ti oxides are more prone to be leached by fluids than zircon grains, probably because the latter has more stable chemical properties.

AB In this study, a detailed space-time-magnitude assessment on the aftershock sequence of July 21th, 2017, M-W 6.5, Bodrum-Kos earthquake (Turkey) is carried out by focusing on the analyses of aftershock parameters: b-value, p-value, Dc-value and Mamax. b-value is estimated as 0.90 +/- 0.05 with a completeness magnitude Mc = 1.6 and this relatively small b-value may be resulted from the abundance of aftershocks with magnitude M-L >= 4.0. However, it is well represented by the Gutenberg-Richter law with a typically b approximate to 1.0. p-value is estimated as 1.04 +/- 0.02 with a c-value = 0.224 +/- 0.039 and is well characterized nearly close to the global p approximate to 1.0. This relatively high p-value may be a result of the relative fast decay rate of the aftershock activity. Dc-value is calculated as 1.74 +/- 0.09 and it means that aftershocks are homogeneously distributed. Temporal distribution of b-value shows that small b-values may be due to a stepwise increase in effective stress before the occurrence of larger aftershocks. Regional changes range from 0.5 to 1.2 in b-value, from 0.4 to 1.3 in p-value and from 3.0 to 5.2 in Mamax. The smallest b-values are found in and around mainshock, including Karaada, Bodrum, Akyarlar and Turgutreis, and these regions have high stress as well as coseismic deformation. The largest p-values are found in and around the mainshock epicenter including Karaada, and it is interpreted that this situation may be caused by coseismic deformation. Mamax values larger than 4.4 are observed in and around mainshock epicenter, including Bodrum and Akyarlar, and there is a clear correlation between spatial variations of b-values and Mamax. These results show that stress changes and coseismic deformation seem highly effective on b and p-value variations. Therefore, a special interest needs to be given to these anomaly regions since aftershock hazard is highly associated with these parameters and may be developed considering their space-time-magnitude distribution.

AB In this work, we consider the discretization of nonlinear hyperbolic systems in nonconservative form with the high-order discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM) based on collocation of quadrature and interpolation points (Kopriva and Gassner (2010) [39]). We present a general framework for the design of such schemes that satisfy a semi-discrete entropy inequality for a given convex entropy function at any approximation order. The framework is closely related to the one introduced for conservation laws by Fisher and Carpenter (2013) [27] and Gassner (2013) [32] and relies on the modification of the integral over discretization elements where we replace the physical fluxes by entropy conservative numerical fluxes from Castro et al. (2013) [12], while entropy stable numerical fluxes are used at element interfaces. Time discretization is performed with strong-stability preserving Runge-Kutta schemes. The present method is first validated on the Burgers and Euler equations in nonconservative form. We then use this framework for the discretization of two-phase flow systems in one space-dimension: a 2 x 2 system with a nonconservative product associated to a linearly-degenerate field for which the DGSEM fails to capture the physically relevant solution, and the isentropic Baer-Nunziato model. For the latter, we derive conditions on the numerical parameters of the discrete scheme to further keep positivity of the partial densities and a maximum principle on the void fractions. Numerical experiments support the conclusions of the present analysis and highlight stability and robustness of the present schemes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Two types of exponential integrators are constructed, one preserves the Poisson structure, and the other preserves energy. Numerical experiments for semilinear Possion systems obtained by semi-discretizing Hamiltonian PDEs are presented. These geometric exponential integrators exhibit better long time stability properties as compared to non-geometric integrators, and are computationally more efficient than traditional symplectic integrators and energy-preserving methods based on the discrete gradient method.

AB Parameter estimation is an important problem because in many instance uncertain parameters cannot be measured accurately, especially in real-time applications. Information about them is commonly inferred via parameter estimation techniques from available measurements of different aspects of the system response. In this work, we consider the reduction of the uncertain topography parameters of 2D shallow water equations to be inconsistency with the physical observations. This is often quite challenging due to its ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, particularly for the present nonlinear case in high-dimensional random space. We have explored an efficient computational strategy for the solution of the problem in the framework of the polynomial chaos (PC)-based ensemble Kalman filter (PC-EnKF for short). The main idea pursued in this methodology is to introduce a determination of the potential optimal observation location followed by the update of the input topography parameters to be retrieved through the PC-EnKF, wherein the identification of the optimal observation locations is accomplished sequentially via the predictive uncertainty controlled by standard deviation, and then places the corresponding measurement for data assimilation purpose. This is not only to provide more informative measurements but also to improve the topography parameters estimation. The numerical experiments indicate that the optimal observations-based PC-EnKF algorithm is effective in dealing with the current retrieval of topography parameters. It is worth mentioning that an iterative PC-basis rotation technique is particularly useful when attempting to enhance the sparsity and the resulting accuracy. The solution strategy is well suited in the current high-dimensional nonlinear inverse modeling and has shown its appealing potential in the real-world application of complex systems.

AB In this paper, a high-order compact finite difference algorithm is proposed for the pure streamfunction (vector potential) formulation of the three dimensional steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, in which the grid values of the streamfunction (vector potential), its first-order and second-order derivatives are carried as the unknown variables. The numerical boundary schemes are also established for a general set of flow problems with no normal speed on the boundaries. Numerical examples, including a test problem with an analytical solution and three types of lid-driven cubic cavity flow problems, are solved numerically by the newly proposed scheme. The results obtained prove that the present numerical method has the ability to solve the three dimensional incompressible flow with high accuracy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A systematic analysis of the discrete conservation properties of non-dissipative, central-difference approximations of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations is reported. A generalized splitting of the nonlinear convective terms is considered, and energy-preserving formulations are fully characterized by deriving a two-parameter family of split forms. Previously developed formulations reported in literature are shown to be particular members of this family; novel splittings are introduced and discussed as well. Furthermore, the conservation properties yielded by different choices for the energy equation (i.e. total and internal energy, entropy) are analyzed thoroughly. It is shown that additional preserved quantities can be obtained through a suitable adaptive selection of the split form within the derived family. Local conservation of primary invariants, which is a fundamental property to build high-fidelity shock-capturing methods, is also discussed in the paper. Numerical tests performed for the Taylor-Green Vortex at zero viscosity fully confirm the theoretical findings, and show that a careful choice of both the splitting and the energy formulation can provide remarkably robust and accurate results.

TI Ray effect mitigation for the discrete ordinates method through
   quadrature rotation
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS

DE Discrete ordinates method; Ray effects; Radiative transfer; Quadrature
ID NEUTRON-TRANSPORT EQUATION; RADIATION HYDRODYNAMICS; TIME
AB Solving the radiation transport equation is a challenging task, due to the high dimensionality of the solution's phase space. The commonly used discrete ordinates (S-N) method suffers from ray effects which result from a break in rotational symmetry from the finite set of directions chosen by S-N. The spherical harmonics (P-N) equations, on the other hand, preserve rotational symmetry, but can produce negative particle densities. By construction, the discrete ordinates (S-N) method ensures non-negative particle densities.
   In this paper we present a modified version of the S-N method, the rotated S-N (rSN) method. Compared to S-N, we add a rotation and interpolation step for the angular quadrature points and the respective function values after every time step. Thereby, the number of directions on which the solution evolves is effectively increased and ray effects are mitigated. Solution values on rotated ordinates are computed by an interpolation step. Implementation details are provided and in our experiments the rotation and interpolation steps only add 5% to 10% to the runtime of the S-N method. We apply the rS(N) method to the line-source and a lattice test case, both being prone to ray effects. Ray effects are reduced significantly, even for small numbers of quadrature points. The rS(N) method yields qualitatively similar solutions to the S-N method with less than a third of the number of quadrature points, both for the line-source and the lattice problem. The code used to produce our results is freely available and can be downloaded [4]. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An efficient implementation of the Newton-Krylov iterative method finding numerical solutions of aggregation-fragmentation equations without spontaneous fragmentation is reported. It is based on application of fast numerical schemes for evaluation of the Smoluchowski operator associated with these equations, and structure of Jacobi matrix, allowing implementation of fast multiplication by a vector. We also propose an efficient preconditioner based on lower triangular band matrix extracted from a Jacobi matrix, resulting in a dramatic speedup of internal GMRES-based iterations between the Newton steps. We compare the efficiency of the novel method with the existing ones and demonstrate a noticeable superiority of our approach. Moreover, we show that the new method may be utilized for modeling of a wider class of aggregation-fragmentation phenomena and derive a new class of quasi-stationary solutions for aggregation-fragmentation equations source of monomers.

AB We develop a numerical framework to implement the cumulative density function (CDF) method for obtaining the probability distribution of the system state described by a stochastic kinematic wave model. The approach relies on the computation of the fine-grained CDF equation of system state, as derived by the CDF method, via the method of characteristics. Due to its linearity, the fine-grained CDF equation is solved far more efficiently than the direct simulation of the kinematic wave model. Since the ensemble mean of the fine-grained CDF solutions is the probability distribution of the original system state, the proposed scheme requires less realizations than direct Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) of the kinematic model and thus converges relatively quickly. We verify the accuracy and effectiveness of our procedure via comparisons with direct MCS of several examples, including a particular kinematic wave system, the Saint-Venant equation.

AB In this paper we develop explicit local time-stepping (LTS) schemes with second and third order accuracy for the shallow water equations. The system is discretized in space by a C-grid staggering method, namely the TRiSK scheme adopted in MPAS-Ocean, a global ocean model with the capability of resolving multiple resolutions within a single simulation. The time integration is designed based on the strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta (SSP-RK) methods, but different time step sizes can be used in different regions of the domain through the coupling of coarse-fine time discretizations on the interface, and are only restricted by respective local CFL conditions. The proposed LTS schemes are of predictor-corrector type in which the predictors are constructed based on Taylor series expansions and SSP-RK stepping algorithms. The schemes preserve some important physical quantities in the discrete sense, such as exact conservation of the mass and potential vorticity and conservation of the total energy within time truncation errors. Moreover, they inherit the natural parallelism of the original explicit global time-stepping schemes. Extensive numerical tests are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.

AB In this paper, a new multiphase SPH model with lower diffusion is developed for simulation of multiphase flows with large density ratios, complex interfaces, and strong impact. The zeroth-order density smoothing algorithm in previous models is replaced by a first-order density correction term which could effectively suppress density/pressure oscillation while lowering numerical diffusion. A switch-function-based artificial viscosity term is proposed to change the global implementation of numerical diffusion in the momentum equation into the local effectiveness depending on the strong impact. Such strategy aims to offer a good balance between the necessary numerical diffusion and the true physical viscosity of the fluid. In order to prove the robustness of the algorithm in various flow problems, five representative numerical examples, including Rayleigh-Taylor instability, internal solitary waves on the pycnocline, air bubble rising in water, oscillation of elliptic droplet and dam breaking, are presented. The expected advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated through comparison with the experimental data and previous numerical results. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a numerical scheme that preserves the total energy and the entropy production rate, termed the energy and entropy production rate preserving scheme, for a general class of thermodynamically consistent phase field models for dendritic crystal growth derived from the first and second law of thermodynamics. The scheme is second order in time, linear and energy and entropy production rate preserving for any time steps. The scheme is first discretized in time aided by the energy quadratization (EQ) method and then in space using compact finite difference methods. The linear system resulting from the scheme is shown to be uniquely solvable at both the semi-discrete and the fully discrete level. Mesh refinement tests are performed to show the second-order time convergence rate in the scheme. Several numerical examples of dendritic crystal growth are provided to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the scheme. The effects of various model parameters on growth patterns of the crystal are further investigated in details with the numerical solver. The approach to developing the energy and entropy production rate-preserving numerical scheme proposed in this study is so general that it can be applied to a wide range of thermodynamically consistent models not limited to phase field models.

AB In this paper, we introduce a new interpolation scheme to approximate the density of states (DOS) for a class of rank-structured matrices with application to the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). The presented approach for approximating the DOS is based on two main techniques. First, we propose an economical method for calculating the traces of parametric matrix resolvents at interpolation points by taking advantage of the block-diagonal plus low-rank matrix structure described in [6, 3] for the BSE/TDA problem. This allows us to overcome the computational difficulties of the traditional schemes since we avoid the construction of the matrix inverse and hence the need of stochastic sampling. Second, we show that a regularized or smoothed DOS discretized on a fine grid of size N can be accurately represented in a low rank quantized tensor train (QTT) format that can be determined through a least squares fitting procedure. The QTT tensor provides good approximation properties for strictly oscillating DOS functions with multiple gaps, in contrast to interpolation by problem independent functions like polynomials, trigonometric functions, etc. Moreover, the QTT approximant requires asymptotically much fewer (e.g., O (log N)) functional calls compared with the full grid size N. Numerical tests indicate that the QTT approach yields accurate recovery of DOS associated with problems that contain relatively large spectral gaps. The QTT tensor rank only weakly depends on the size of a molecular system that paves the way for treatment of large-scale spectral problems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this work we propose a hydrodynamic stress model that accurately reconstructs the forces on an immersed body, with application to the simulation of turbulence interacting with finite-size particles of arbitrary shape. The proposed model is local and is based on the boundary layer approximation, where the effects of surface curvature on the pressure variation are accounted for. Numerical experiments show that the model requires about one or two grid points within the boundary layer to accurately reconstruct the hydrodynamic force distribution. This reduces significantly the cost of resolving the flow field around the particles. The accuracy of the proposed model is evaluated in a variety of flows with increasing complexity. In particular, results for the flows over stationary and oscillating circular cylinders, free falling cylinders and spheres, and the interaction of turbulence with spheres and ellipsoids will be presented.

AB In this paper, we first extend the micro-macro decomposition method for multiscale kinetic equations from the BGK model to general collisional kinetic equations, including the Boltzmann and the Fokker-Planck Landau equations. The main idea is to use a relation between the (numerically stiff) linearized collision operator with the nonlinear quadratic ones, the latter's stiffness can be overcome using the BGK penalization method of Filbet and Jin for the Boltzmann, or the linear Fokker-Planck penalization method of Jin and Yan for the Fokker-Planck Landau equations. Such a scheme allows the computation of multiscale collisional kinetic equations efficiently in all regimes, including the fluid regime in which the fluid dynamic behavior can be correctly computed even without resolving the small Knudsen number. A distinguished feature of these schemes is that although they contain implicit terms, they can be implemented explicitly. These schemes preserve the moments (mass, momentum and energy) exactly thanks to the use of the macroscopic system which is naturally in a conservative form. We further utilize this conservation property for more general kinetic systems, using the Vlasov-Ampere and Vlasov-Ampere-Boltzmann systems as examples. The main idea is to evolve both the kinetic equation for the probability density distribution and the moment system, the later naturally induces a scheme that conserves exactly the moments numerically if they are physically conserved.

AB A space-time fully adaptive multiresolution method for evolutionary non-linear partial differential equations is presented introducing an improved local time-stepping method. The space discretisation is based on classical finite volumes, endowed with cell average multiresolution analysis for triggering the dynamical grid adaptation. The explicit time scheme features a natural extension of Runge-Kutta methods which allow local time-stepping while guaranteeing accuracy. The use of a compact Runge-Kutta formulation permits further memory reduction. The precision and computational efficiency of the scheme regarding CPU time and memory compression are assessed for problems in one, two and three space dimensions. As application Burgers equation, reaction-diffusion equations and the compressible Euler equations are considered. The numerical results illustrate the efficiency and superiority of the proposed local time-stepping method with respect to the reference computations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB One of the main energy consumptions in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is due to the oxygenation of aerobic biological processes. In order to approach to an energy self-sufficient scenario in WWTPs, Membrane Aerated Biofilm Reactors (MABRs) provide a good opportunity to reduce the impact of aeration on the global energy balance. However, mass transfer limitations derived from poor flow distribution must be tackled to take advantage of this technology. In this work, in order to improve mass transfer between biofilm and bulk water, a specific configuration was developed and studied at laboratory scale, aimed at compactness, energy efficiency and high nitrification rates. Nitrification rates were higher in the innovative configuration than in the conventional one, achieving a Volumetric Nitrification Rate (VNR) as high as 575.84 g NH4-N m(-3) d(-1), which is comparable with confirmed technologies. Regarding energy consumption due to aeration, a reduction of 83.7% was reached in comparison with aeration through diffusers with the same Oxygen Transfer Efficiency (OTE). These results highlight the importance of hydrodynamic conditions and the membranes configuration on treatment performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Incorporating Ru in a Ni catalyst for gasification of phenol in supercritical water at 450 degrees C and 30 min promoted formation of cyclohexanol via hydrogenation, which is a key step toward gasification. Both Ni and Ni-Ru catalysts were effective to reduce the formation of cyclohexanone and oligomerization products, compared with the case with no catalyst. H-2 and CH4 yields increased as the Ru/Ni ratio increased, as did the carbon and hydrogen yields in the gas phase products. The Ni80Ru20/Al2O3 catalyst provided good gasification performance and it exhibits Ru (101), Ru (100) and Ni (111) facets and evidence of overlaid bimetallic particles. DFT calculations show that the presence of Ru (either as pure Ru or as a Ni-Ru alloy) reduces the energy barrier for phenol hydrogenation by close to 0.2 eV relative to pure Ni, and that the energy barrier is not as largely affected by the amount of Ru present, provided it is non-zero.

AB Microplastics have aroused increasing concern as they pose threats to aquatic species as well as human beings. They do not only contribute to accumulation of plastics in the environment, but due to absorption they can also contribute to spreading of micropollutants in the environment. Studies indicated that wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) play an important role in releasing microplastics to the environment. Therefore, effective detection of the microplastics and understanding their occurrence and fate in WWTPs are of great importance towards microplastics control. In this review, the up-to-date status on the detection, occurrence and removal of microplastics in WWTPs are comprehensively reviewed. Specifically, the different techniques used for collecting microplastics from both wastewater and sewage sludge, and their pretreatment and characterization methods are reviewed and analyzed. The key aspects regarding microplastics occurrence in WWTPs, such as concentrations, total discharges, materials, shapes and sizes are summarized and compared. Microplastics removal in different treatment stages and their retention in sewage sludge are explored. The development of potential microplastics-targeted treatment technologies is also presented. Although previous researches in microplastics have undoubtedly improved our level of understanding, it is clear that much remains to be learned about microplastics in WWTPs, as many unanswered questions and thereby concerns still remain; some of these important future research areas are outlined. The key challenges appear to be to harmonize detection methods as well as microplastics mitigation from wastewater and sewage sludge. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pharmaceuticals in agricultural soils originating from irrigation with treated wastewater and land applied biosolids can enter field crops. However, little is known about the role of pore water in plant uptake of pharmaceuticals from soils. In this study, the fate, uptake and distribution of fifteen commonly used pharmaceuticals in soil-water-radish systems were investigated to examine the relationship between the accumulation and their physicochemical processes in soils. The results indicate that the distribution of pharmaceuticals between soil and pore water, as well as their biodegradation, combined to govern the bioavailability of pharmaceuticals to plant uptake. Fourteen out of 15 pharmaceuticals could enter radish tissues in which the accumulation ranged from 2.1 to 14080 ng/g. Comparison of bio-concentration factors (BCFs) on the basis of pharmaceutical concentration in bulk soil vs. in pore water implies that pharmaceuticals present in soil pore water are the major bioavailable fractions to plant uptake. The pore water-based BCFs exhibited a positive linear relationship with log D-ow for the pharmaceuticals with >90% as neutral species in soil pore water, while such relationship was not observed between bulk soil-based BCFs and log D-ow mainly due to sorption by soil. Other than hydrophobicity, the dissociation of ionizable pharmaceuticals in the soil pore water and (or) root cells may lead to the "ion-trap" effects and thus influence the uptake and translocation process. The large molecular-size pharmaceuticals (e.g., tylosin) manifested a minimum uptake due plausibly to the limited permeability of cell membranes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The assessment of water quality is crucial for safeguarding drinking water resources and ecosystem integrity. To this end, sample preparation and extraction is critically important, especially when investigating emerging contaminants and the toxicity of water samples. As extraction methods are rarely optimised for bioassays but rather adopted from chemical analysis, this may result in a misrepresentation of the actual toxicity.
   In this study, surface water, groundwater, hospital and municipal wastewater were used to characterise the impacts of common sample preparation techniques (acidification, filtration and solid phase extraction (SPE)) on the outcomes of eleven in vitro bioassays. The latter covered endocrine activity (reporter gene assays for estrogen, androgen, aryl-hydrocarbon, retinoic acid, retinoid X, vitamin D, thyroid receptor), mutagenicity (Ames fluctuation test), genotoxicity (umu test) and cytotoxicity. Water samples extracted using different SPE sorbents (Oasis HLB, Supelco ENVI-Carb+, Telos C18/ENV) at acidic and neutral pH were compared for their performance in recovering biological effects.
   Acidification, commonly used for stabilisation, significantly altered the endocrine activity and toxicity of most (waste)water samples. Sample filtration did not affect the majority of endpoints but in certain cases affected the (anti-)estrogenic and dioxin-like activities. SPE extracts (10.4 x final concentration), including WWTP effluents, induced significant endocrine effects that were not detected in aqueous samples (0.63 x final concentration), such as estrogenic, (anti-)androgenic and dioxin-like activities. When ranking the SPE methods using multivariate Pareto optimisation an extraction with Telos C18/ENV at pH 7 was most effective in recovering toxicity. At the same time, these extracts were highly cytotoxic masking the endpoint under investigation. Compared to that, extraction at pH 2.5 enriched less cytotoxicity.
   In summary, our study demonstrates that sample preparation and extraction critically affect the outcome of bioassays when assessing the toxicity of water samples. Depending on the water matrix and the bioassay, these methods need to be optimised to accurately assess water quality. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Conditioning can drastically improve the dewaterability of sewage sludge and thus it is widely practiced in most wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In WWTPs, various antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) present in sewage are concentrated in the sewage sludge, but the effect of sludge conditioning on ARGs in sewage sludge remains unclear. Here, we evaluated and compared the effectiveness of four sludge conditioning methods (namely chemical conditioning with polyacrylamide (PAM), chemical conditioning with Fe[III]/CaO, bioleaching conditioning, and chemical acidification conditioning) and an aerobic incubation control in removing 46 target ARGs and intI1 from a municipal sewage sludge. The damage of sludge microbial cells and the change in the sludge bacterial community during the various sludge conditioning treatments were also characterized. The results suggested that the chemical conditioning with PAM and aerobic incubation treatment did not remove ARGs and intI1 from the sewage sludge. The chemical acidification reduced the absolute abundances of most ARGs and intI1, but increased their relative abundances. However, the chemical conditioning with Fe[III]/CaO and bioleaching conditioning reduced both the absolute and relative abundances of most ARGs and removed a majority of extracellular ARGs in the sludge. During sludge conditioning treatments, the sludge microbial cells were severely damaged to decrease the total bacterial biomass in sludge, and accordingly the bacterial hosts carrying ARGs and intI were effectively damaged to reduce the absolute abundances of most ARGs and intI1. In addition, the sludge bacterial community in conditioned sludge determined the relative abundances of residual ARGs. Our findings suggest that sludge conditioning can be an important sludge treatment process in attenuating antibiotic resistance in sewage sludge, and bioleaching and chemical conditioning with Fe[III]/CaO can be employed as effective conditioning ways to reduce ARGs in sewage sludge, potentially limiting their release to the environment.

AB Inorganic chloramines (mono-, di- and trichloramine) are formed in swimming pool water from the unintended reaction of free chlorine with ammonia that is introduced by bathers. Monochloramine is of particular interest as it is known to react further in pool water forming harmful DBPs, such carcinogenic N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). During pool water treatment with granular activated carbon (GAC) filters, monochloramine is transformed by chemical reactions on the carbon surface to N-2 and ammonia. As ammonia is led back into the pool where it is chlorinated again under the renewed formation of inorganic chloramines, it is recommended to use GACs with a high N-2 yield for monochloramine transformation in pool water treatment.
   In this study, yields of N-2 and ammonia from monochloramine conversion by commercially available GACs were determined using a fixed-bed reactor system under conditions that are typical for swimming pool water treatment. The N-2 yields remained constant with on-going exposure of the GAC to monochloramine and ranged from 0.5% to 21.3%, depending on the type of GAC used. Correlation analyses were conducted to identify carbon properties that can determine the N-2 yield for monochloramine conversion, such as the amount of oxygen groups, the elemental composition and the trace metal content. It was found that the N-2 yield significantly correlates with the copper content of the tested carbons. Model calculations combining pool hydraulics with formation/abatement of inorganic chloramines and NDMA as well as chloramine transformations in GAC filters showed that the concentration of inorganic chloramines and carcinogenic NDMA can be decreased by a factor of similar to 2, if the tested GACs could be modified to convert up to similar to 50% of the monochloramine to N-2.

AB Halo-priming is an effective approach to initiate microbial reductive dechlorination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at contaminated sites, of which the application has been restricted by introducing extra pollutants generated from priming organohalides. In this study, tetrachloroethene (PCE) was demonstrated to be an effective priming compound to enhance PCB dechlorination both in a PCB-dechlorinating pure culture and a river sediment microcosm. In the isolated PCB-dechlorinating Dehalococcoides mccartyi CG1, PCB dechlorination activities were stimulated by adding 0.05-0.2 mM PCE, and were inhibited when further increasing PCE concentrations. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that PCBs and PCE were synchronously dechlorinated in D. mccartyi CG1. In a river sediment microcosm, which was established to mimic in situ biostimulation of PCB dechlorination, 0.2 mM PCE could significantly improve para-chlorine removal from both PCB180 (2345-245-CB) and Aroclor 1260, and increase the relative abundance of indigenous dechlorinating Dehalococcoides for more than 20 times (from <0.1% to 2.3-5.0%). At the same time, PCE as a priming compound was completely dechlorinated to non-toxic ethene. Overall, this study provided an efficient strategy to stimulate in situ bioremediation of PCBs.

AB A wide range of cyanobacterial species and their harmful metabolites are increasingly detected in water bodies worldwide, exacerbated by climate change and human activities. The resulting bloom conditions represent significant challenges to production of safe drinking water and cost effective water reuse, therefore their removal is a priority to ensure public safety. While current microscopic taxonomy identification methods provide valuable information about cell numbers during treatment, these methods are incapable of providing information about the fate of cells during treatment. The objectives of this study were to (1) identify the critical control points for breakthrough and accumulation of cells by investigating the fate of cells during treatment processes using a combination of taxonomy, cell integrity and next-generation sequencing (NGS), and (2) assess the impact of pre-treatment processes on breakthrough prevention at critical control points, and the benefits of cell integrity and NGS analysis for improved management purposes. This paper presents the results of an unprecedented cyanobacterial monitoring program conducted in four full scale water treatment plants located in three different climate zones. Cyanobacterial cell integrity and accumulation during operation process were assessed for the first time using next generation of gene sequencing methods. NGS analysis led to detection of cyanobacterial and melainabacteria orders in water samples that were not identified by microscopy. 80 +/- 5% of cells were completely lysed post pre-oxidation (for both ozone and potassium permanganate). However unlike pre-ozonation, the remaining cells were undamaged cells with the potential to accumulate and grow within the plants post-KMnO4 treatment, particularly in clarifier sludge. To effectively monitor water quality, this study presents a synergistic approach coupling new and traditional analytical methods and demonstrates the importance of identifying critical points for managing accumulation of cyanobacteria within plants.

AB Dissolved carbon (DC) is a critical component of the global carbon (C) cycle. DC transport occurs through water-driven erosion and infiltration during rain storms. To explore the specific role of DC flux in topsoil C pool dynamics during rainfall events and predict the trend of ratios of lateral versus vertical DC efflux from topsoil in a vegetation restoration area, we measured the major DC fluxes at four runoff plots, during rainfall events in an eroding soil landscape on the Chinese Loess Plateau. The results show that topsoil vertical DC efflux into deep soil layers accounted for approximately 98.7 (+/- 1.0) % of the total dissolved carbon efflux in plots with vegetation versus 95.3% in a plot without vegetation. The carbon sequestration capacity of the top soil would be underestimated by up to 38 (+/- 5) % if the vertical DC efflux was omitted. The ratios of lateral versus vertical DC efflux tended to increase with rainfall intensity. The results of this study improve understanding of the carbon cycle processes during rainfall events in general and estimation of carbon sequestration rates in vegetation restoration regions such as the Chinese Loess Plateau in particular.

AB Urine is a major biomass resource, and its excessive discharge would lead to severe aquatic nitrogen pollution and even eutrophication. In this study, we designed an innovative denitrifying fuel cell (DFC) under illumination to purify urine and convert its chemical energy into electricity. The central ideas include the following: 1) on the anode, chlorine radicals (Cl-center dot) and hydroxyl (HO center dot) radicals were induced to react with amine or ammonia in urine into N-2, and to mineralize organics into CO2, respectively; 2) on the cathode, NO2- or NO3- generated in the cell was selectively reduced to N-2 and tiny NH4+ by Pd/Au/NF; 3) NH4+ was further oxidized to N-2 by Cl-center dot according to process 1), then the total nitrogen (TN) was ultimately removed by a continuous redox loop between anode and cathode; 4) the separation and migration of charges were strengthened by a self-bias poly-Si/WO3 photoanode. Result indicated that the DFC showed an efficient yield of electricity and almost completely N-removing properties: power density of 2.24 mW cm(-2), total nitrogen and total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency, respectively 99.02% and 50.76% for artificial urine; and power density of 2.51 mW cm(-2), TN and TOC removal efficiency, respectively 98.60% and 54.55% for actual urine. The study proposes a potential and environment friendly approach by using novel DFC to purify urine and generate electricity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the growing field of capacitive deionization (CDI), a number of performance metrics have emerged to describe the desalination process. Unfortunately, the separation conditions under which these metrics are measured are often not specified, resulting in optimal performance at minimal removal. Here we outline a system of performance metrics and reporting conditions that resolves this issue. Our proposed system is based on volumetric energy consumption (Wh/m(3)) and throughput productivity (L/h/m(2)) reported for a specific average concentration reduction, water recovery, and feed salinity. To facilitate and rationalize comparisons between devices, materials, and operation modes, we propose a nominal standard separation of removing 5 mM from a 20 mM NaCl feed solution at 50% water recovery. We propose this particular separation as a standard, but emphasize that the rationale presented here applies irrespective of separation details. Using our proposed separation, we compare the desalination performance of a flow-through electrode (fte-CDI) cell and a flow between membrane (fb-MCDI) device, showing how significantly different systems can be compared in terms of generally desirable desalination characteristics. In general, we find that performance analysis must be considered carefully so to not allow for ambiguous separation conditions or the maximization of one metric at the expense of another. Additionally, for context and clarity, we discuss a number of important underlying performance indicators and cell characteristics that are not performance measures in and of themselves but can be examined to better understand differences in performance.

AB Nutrient losses in our food chain severely surpass our planetary boundaries. Resource recovery can contribute to mitigation, for instance through converting wastewater resources to microbial protein for animal feed. Wastewater typically holds a complex mixture of organics, posing a challenge to selectively produce heterotrophic biomass. Ensuring the product's quality could be achieved by anaerobic generation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) followed by photoheterotrophic production of purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNSB) with infrared light. This study aimed to determine the most suitable PNSB culture for VFA conversion and map the effect of acetate, propionate, butyrate and a VFA mixture on growth and biomass yield. Six cultures were screened in batch: (i) Rhodopseudomonas palustris, (ii) Rhodobacter sphaeroides, (iii) Rhodospirillum rubrum, (iv) a 3-species synthetic community (i+ii+iii) (v) a community enriched on VFA holding Rb. capsulatus, and (vi) Rb. capsulatus (isolate 'v'). The VFA mixture elevated growth rates with a factor 1.3-2.5 compared to individual VFA. Rb. capsulatus showed the highest growth rates: 1.8 -2.2 d(-1) (enriched) and 2.3-3.8 d(-1) (isolated). In a photobioreactor (PBR) inoculated with the Rb. capsulatus enrichment, decreasing sludge retention time (SRT) yielded lower biomass concentrations, yet increased productivities, reaching 1.7 g dry weight (DW) L-1 d(-1), the highest phototrophic rate reported thus far, and a growth rate of up to 5 d(-1). PNSB represented 26-57% of the community and the diversity index was low (3-7), with a dominance of Rhodopseudomonas at long SRT and Rhodobacter at short SRT. The biomass yield for all cultures, in batch and reactor cultivation, approached 1 g CODBiomass g(-1) CODRemoved. An economic estimation for a two-stage approach on brewery wastewater (load 2427 kg COD d(-1)) showed that 0.5 d SRT allowed for the lowest production cost ((sic) 10 kg(-1) DW; equal shares for capex and opex). The findings strengthen the potential for a novel two-stage approach for resource recovery from industrial wastewater, enabling high-rate PNSB production. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are emerging contaminants of critical concern for human health risk. Assessing exposure risk requires a thorough understanding of the transport and fate behavior of PFAS in the environment. Adsorption to fluid-fluid interfaces, which include air-water, OIL-water, and air-OIL interfaces (where OIL represents organic immiscible liquid), is a potentially significant retention process for PFAS transport. Fluid-fluid interfacial adsorption coefficients (K-i) are required for use in transport modeling and risk characterization, yet these data are currently not available for the vast majority of PFAS. Surface-tension and interfacial-tension data sets collected from the literature were used to determine interfacial adsorption coefficients for 42 individual PFAS. The PFAS evaluated comprise homologous series of perfluorocarboxylates and perfluorosulfonates, branched perfluoroalkyls, polyfluoroalkyls, alcohol PFAS, and nonionic PFAS. The K-i values vary across eight orders of magnitude, and are a function of molecular structure. The results of quantitative-structure/property-relationship (QSPR) analysis demonstrate that a model employing molar volume (V-m) as a descriptor provides robust predictions of log Ki values for air-water interfacial adsorption of the wide range of PFAS. The model also produced good predictions for a limited set of data for OIL-water interfacial adsorption. The predictive capability of the QSPR model for a wide range of PFAS with greatly varying structures reflects the fact that molar volume provides a reasonable representation of the influence of molecular size on cavity formation/destruction in solution, and thus the hydrophobic-interaction driving force for interfacial adsorption. The QSPR model presented herein provides a means to incorporate the fluid-fluid interfacial adsorption process into transport characterization and risk assessment of PFAS in the environment. This will be particularly relevant for determining PFAS mass flux in the atmosphere, in the vadose zone, in source zones containing organic immiscible liquids, and in water/wastewater treatment systems.

AB We present a novel stochastic model for quantifying gross solids (GS) physical disintegration under varying turbulent flow conditions and used a unique experimental setup for model calibration and validation. The stochastic deterioration model predicts faeces size evolution over time. It conceptually entails the two main processes of solid fragmentation, namely breakage and erosion. Model parameters were calibrated on synthetic faeces and validated with real human ones. A cylindrical reactor was used, where turbulent flow was forced by an array of water jets and the physical disintegration of the faeces was monitored using a high speed camera. Image analysis of breakage experiments obtained under backlight illumination allowed determination of the evolution of the solids' size over time. The flow field in the reactor was characterised by particle image velocimetry (Ply) using tracer particles seeded into the water. We found different disintegration behaviours depending on turbulence intensity and water content of the solid. In conditions of low shear stress, dense solids hardly disintegrated. Generally, the model predictions mirrored the broad range in the solids disintegration rate imparted by the high variability in flow conditions and in solids characteristics. It is expected that, similar to our experiments, also in real sewer systems both flow conditions and solid characteristics are highly variable and the stochastic model can be tailored to capture this variability. We thus anticipate that the model can be integrated into existing sewer models predicting sewer flows and solids' movement. From these, shear stress, flow velocities and transport of individual solids can be inferred. The integration of the present solids disintegration model may provide better predictions of hot-spots for solids accumulation and blockages in sewers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Hospital wastewater (HWW) effluents represent an important source of contaminants such as pharmaceutical compounds and their human metabolites. To better evaluate dedicated treatment of hospital effluents for pollutant mitigation, not only the parent compounds should be considered but also the intermediates generated during treatment. The metabolite metoprolol acid (MTPA) has been found in urban wastewaters at higher concentration than its parent compound metoprolol (MTP), being more recalcitrant to biodegradation. The aim of this study was to investigate degradation, transformation and sorption of the beta-blocker MTP, and its recalcitrant metabolite MTPA, during water treatment based on the fungi Ganoderma lucidum, Trametes versicolor and Pleurotus ostreatus. Fourteen intermediates were identified in MTP biotransformation while five of them also attributed to MTPA biodegradation and two to MTPA only. Their identification allowed their correlation in separate biotransformation pathways suggested. The highest degradation rate of metoprolol (up to 51%) and metoprolol acid (almost 77%) was found after 15-days treatment with Ganoderma lucidum, with an increase in toxicity up to 29% and 4%, respectively. This fungus was further selected for treating real HWW in a batch fluidized bed bioreactor (FBB). Treated wastewater and fungal biomass samples were used to evaluate the distribution of the target compounds and the intermediates identified between solid and liquid phases. While similar elimination capabilities were observed for the removal of metoprolol, and even higher for its persistent metabolite metoprolol acid, the extent on compound transformation diminished considerably compared with the study treating purified water: a high level of the persistent alpha-HMTP and TP240 were still present in effluent samples (15% and 6%, respectively), being both TPs present at high proportion (up to 28%) in fungal biomass. This is the first time that pharmaceutical TPs have been investigated in the fungal biomass. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Advanced oxidation process is one of the important process to improve the efficiency of activated sludge dewatering and digestion. In this study, electro-Fenton (EF) was investigated as a pretreatment method for improving activated sludge dewatering and disintegration in terms of specific resistance to filtration, volatile suspended solids removal and release of soluble organics. The morphology of sludge flocs and properties of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) were investigated to understand the involved mechanisms. The results showed that EF could increase the dewaterability of activated sludge effectively in 40-60 min. The size of sludge flocs decreased after EF treatment, but zeta potential was elevated to near zero and floc structure became coarser with bigger holes. EF could enhance the sludge floc disintegration, released protein and polysaccharide to soluble EPS fraction, and promote the humification process. The kinetic analysis further indicated that EF increased the pseudo first-order EPS solubilization rate. EF had high operational stability by retaining over 90% initial activity even after five repeated use of dewatering filtrate. This study provides a rapid and efficient solution for improving sludge dewaterability by electro-Fenton. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in drinking water and their potential horizontal transfer to pathogenic microbes may cause failure of antibiotics. However, antimicrobial resistome monitoring in drinking water is not currently routine. The bacterial hosts of ARGs, especially small-sized microbes in drinking water, may not be effectively removed by membrane filtration disinfection and thus pose threats to human health. In the present study, using metagenomic based approach, we investigated antibiotic resistome of small-sized microbes (0.2-0.45 mu m) in 20 household drinking water samples from 12 cities in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore. A total of 265 ARG subtypes belonging to 17 ARG types were detected at abundances ranging from 4.0 x 10(-2) to 1.0 x 10(0) copies/cell. Multidrug, bacitracin and aminoglycoside resistance genes are dominant, and 43 ARG subtypes were specifically carried by small-size microbes. Metagenomic assembly strategy revealed fragments of three opportunistic pathogen, i.e. Pseudomonas alcaligenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Mycobacterium gordonae, carried mexW, aph(3')-I and aac(2')-I, respectively. Drinking water samples were classified into three groups based on the presence of ARG, pathogen and ARG-carrying pathogen. These new insights into the antibiotic resistome of small microbes in drinking water over a broad scale indicate the need for more comprehensive ARGs monitoring and surveillance of drinking water supplies. These findings, together with the perspectives and strategies proposed in this study, could support initiatives to improve drinking water safety. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biotransformation of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in wastewater treatment plants ultimately depends on the enzymatic activities developed in each biological process. However, few research efforts have been made to clarify and identify the role of enzymes on the removal of OMPs, which is an essential knowledge to determine the biotransformation potential of treatment technologies. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the enzymatic transformation of 35 OMPs under anaerobic conditions, which have been even less studied than aerobic systems. Initially, 13 OMPs were identified to be significantly biotransformed (>20%) by anaerobic sludge obtained from a full-scale anaerobic digester, predestining them as potential targets of anaerobic enzymes. Native enzymes were extracted from this anaerobic sludge to perform transformation assays with the OMPs. In addition, the effect of detergents to recover membrane enzymes, as well as the effects of cofactors and inhibitors to promote and suppress specific enzymatic activities were evaluated. In total, it was possible to recover enzymatic activities towards 10 out of these 13 target OMPs (acetyl-sulfamethoxazole and its transformation product sulfamethoxazole, acetaminophen, atenolol, clarithromycin, citalopram, climbazole, erythromycin, and terbutryn, venlafaxine) as well as towards 8 non-target OMPs (diclofenac, iopamidol, acyclovir, acesulfame, and 4 different hydroxylated metabolites of carbamazepine). Some enzymatic activities likely involved in the anaerobic biotransformation of these OMPs were identified. Thereby, this study is a starting point to unravel the still enigmatic biotransformation of OMPs in wastewater treatment systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ozone and biological activated carbon (O-3/BAC) is being considered as an alternative advanced treatment process to microfiltration and reverse osmosis (MF/RO) for the potable reuse of municipal wastewater. Similarly, the UV/free chlorine (UV/HOCl) advanced oxidation process (AOP) is being considered as an alternative to the UV/hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2) AOP. This study compared the performance of these alternative treatment processes for controlling N-nitrosamines and chloramine-reactive N-nitrosamine and halogenated disinfection byproduct (DBP) precursors during parallel, pilot-scale treatment of tertiary municipal wastewater effluent. O-3/BAC outperformed MF/RO for controlling N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), while MF/RO was more effective for controlling N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) and chloramine-reactive NDMA precursors. The UV/H2O2 and UV/HOCI AOPs were equally effective for controlling N-nitrosamines in O-3/BAC effluent, but UV/HOCI was less effective for controlling NDMA in MF/RO effluent, likely due to the promotion of dichloramine under these conditions. MF/RO was more effective than O-3/BAC for controlling chloramine-reactive halogenated DBP precursors on both a mass and toxicity-weighted basis. UV/H2O2 AOP treatment was more effective at controlling the toxicity-weighted chloramine-reactive DBP precursors for most halogenated DBP classes by preferentially degrading the more toxic brominated species. However, the total toxicity-weighted DBP precursor concentrations were similar for treatment by either AOP because UV/H2O2 AOP treatment promoted the formation of iodoacetic acid, which exhibits a very high toxic potency.

AB The presence of ammonium NH4+ in drinking water treatment results in inhibition of disinfection efficiency and formation of nitrogenous disinfection by-products. Our previous study found monochloramine NH2Cl photolysis under 254 nm UV irradiation can be effective for removal of NH4+; however, the mechanisms of NH4+ degradation in this process were unknown. The kinetics and fundamental radical chemistry responsible for NH4+ removal in the UV/NH2Cl process were investigated in this study. The results showed that the pseudo first-order rate constant for NH4+ degradation in the UV/NH2Cl process ranged between 3.6 x 10(-4) to 1.8 x 10(-3) s(-1). Solution pH affected radical conversion and a higher NH4+ degradation efficiency was achieved under acidic conditions. The effects of chloride were limited; however, the presence of either bicarbonate or natural organic matter scavenged radicals and inhibited NH4+ removal. NH2Cl photolysis generated an aminyl radical (NH2 center dot) and a chlorine radical Cl that further transformed to a chlorine dimer (Cl-2(center dot-)) and a hydroxyl radical (HO center dot). The second-order rate constants for Cl-center dot<bold> </bold>and Cl-2(center dot) reacting with NH4+ were estimated as 2.59 x 10(-8) M(-1)s(-1) and 3.45 x 10(-5) M(-1)s(-1) at pH 3.9, respectively. Cl-center dot, Cl-2(center dot), and HO center dot<bold> </bold>contributed<bold> </bold>95.2%, 3.5%, and 1.3% to NH4+ removal, respectively, at the condition of 3 mM NH2Cl and pH 7.5. Major products included nitrite and nitrate, possibly accompanied by nitrogen-containing gases. This investigation provides insight into the photochemistry of NH4+ degradation in the UV/NH2Cl process and offers an alternative method for drinking water production. (C) 2019 Elseiver Ltd.

AB In addition to undesirable odorous gases, substantial amounts of greenhouse gases (GHG), particularly methane (CH4), are generated during the storage of livestock manure. To reduce the CH4 emissions, first, pig slurry (PS) was stored for 40 d at 30 degrees C after adjusting the pH at 5.0-7.0 using H2SO4 solution. In the control (non-acidified PS), 3.7 kg CO2 eq./ton PS of CH4 emissions was detected, which was reduced to 1.8, 0.9, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1 kg CO2 eq./ton PS at pH 7.0, 6.5, 6.0, 5.5, and 5.0, respectively. Methanosarcina was found to be the dominant genus (67% of the total archaeal sequence) in the control, whose dominance was reduced as storage pH decreased. The results of ribonucleic acid analysis and specific methanogenic activity test further confirmed the inhibition of indigenous methanogens by acidification. Later, the biochemical CH4 potential of stored PS was tested. Compared to the control (10.6 L CH4/L PS), the acidified PS showed higher CH4 yields of 12.7-14.6 L CH4/L PS, presumably by keeping degradable organic matters in PS under acidic condition. Among different acidification pHs tested, the maximum amount of GHG reduction was achieved at pH 6.0 by reducing CH4 emission to +0.4 kg CO2 eq./ton PS during storage while increasing biogas production potential equivalent to 48.3 kWh/ton PS (-22.5 kg CO2 eq./ton PS), resulting in a further reduction of (-)9.6 kg CO2 eq./ton PS compared to the control.

AB Microbiological water quality is traditionally assessed using culture-based enumeration of faecal indicator bacteria such as Escherichia coll. Despite their relative ease of use, these methods require a minimal 18-24 h-incubation step before the results are obtained. This study aimed to assess the suitability of an autonomous online fluorescence-based technology measuring beta-glucuronidase (GLUC) activity for rapid near-real time monitoring of E. coli in water. The analytical precision was determined and compared to an automated microbial detection system, two culture-based assays and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Using replicate measurements of grab samples containing E. coil concentrations between 50 and 2330 CFU.100 mL(-1), the autonomous GLUC activity measurement technology displayed an average coefficient of variation (CV) of less than 5% that was 4-8-fold lower than other methods tested. Comparable precision was observed during online in situ monitoring of GLUC activity at a drinking water intake using three independent instruments. GLUC activity measurements were not affected by sewage or sediments at concentrations likely to be encountered during long-term monitoring. Furthermore, significant (p < 0.05) correlations were obtained between GLUC activity and the other assays including defined substrate technology (r = 0.77), membrane filtration (r = 0.73), qPCR (r = 0.55) and the automated microbial detection system (r = 0.50). This study is the first to thoroughly compare the analytical performance of rapid automated detection technologies to established culture and molecular-based methods. Results show that further research is required to correlate GLUC activity to the presence of viable E. coli as measured in terms of CFU.100 mL(-1). This would allow the use of autonomous online GLUC activity measurements for rapid E. coli monitoring in water supplies used for drinking water production and recreation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Biogeochemical redox processes that govern radionuclide mobility in sediments are highly sensitive to forcing by the water cycle. For example, episodic draining and intrusion of oxidants into reduced zones during dry seasons can create biogeochemical seasonal hotspots of enhanced and changed microbial activity, affect the redox status of minerals, initiate changes in sediment gas and water transport, and stimulate the release of organic carbon, iron, and sulfur by oxidation of solid reduced species to aqueous oxic species. In the Upper Colorado River Basin, water-saturation of organic-enriched sediments locally promotes reducing conditions, denoted 'Naturally Reduced Zones' (NRZs), that accumulate strongly U(IV)(sol center dot) Subsequently, fluctuating hydrological conditions introduce oxidants, which may reach internal portions of these sediments and reverse their role to become secondary sources of U-aq. Knowledge of the impact of hydrological variability on the alternating import and export of contaminants, including U, is required to predict contaminant mobility and short- and long-term impacts on water quality.
   In this study, we tracked U, Fe, and S oxidation states and speciation to characterize the variability in redox processes and related U-sol solubility within shallow fine-grained NRZs at the legacy U ore processing site at Shiprock, NM. Previous studies have reported U speciation and behavior in permanently saturated fine-grained NRZ sediments. This is the first report of U behavior in fine-grained NRZ-like sediments that experience repeated redox cycling due to seasonal fluctuations in moisture content. Our results support previous observations that reducing conditions are needed to accumulate U-sol in sediments, but they counter the expectation that U-sol predominantly accumulates as U(IV)(sol); our data reveal that Us01 may accumulate as U(V1)(sol) in roughly equal proportion to U(IV)sol. Surprisingly high abundances of U(VI)(sol) confined in transiently saturated fine-grained NRZ-like sediments suggest that redox cycling is needed to promote its accumulation. We propose a new process model, where redox oscillations driven by annual water table fluctuations, accompanied by strong evapotranspiration in low permeability sediments, promote conversion of U(IV)(sol) to relatively immobile U(VI)(sol), which suggests that U-sol is accumulating in a form that is resistant to redox perturbations. This observation contradicts the common idea that U(IV)(sol) accumulated in reducing conditions is systematically re-oxidized, solubilized and transported away in groundwater. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Viruses are thought to control bacterial abundance, affect community composition and influence ecosystem function in natural environments. Yet their dynamics have seldom been studied in engineered systems, or indeed in any system, for long periods of time. We measured virus abundance in a full-scale activated sludge plant every week for two years. Total bacteria and ammonia oxidising bacteria (AOB) abundances, bacterial community profiles, and a suite of environmental and operational parameters were also monitored. Mixed liquor virus abundance fluctuated over an order of magnitude (3.18 x 10(8) -3.41 x 10 virus's mL(-1)) and that variation was statistically significantly associated with total bacterial and AOB abundance, community composition, and effluent concentrations of COD and NH4+-N and thus system function. This suggests viruses play a far more important role in the dynamics of activated sludge systems than previously realised and could be one of the key factors controlling bacterial abundance, community structure and functional stability and may cause reactors to fail. These findings are based on statistical associations, not mechanistic models. Nevertheless, viral associations with abiotic factors, such as pH, make physical sense, giving credence to these findings and highlighting the role that physical factors play in virus ecology. Further work is needed to identify and quantify specific bacteriophage and their hosts to enable us to develop mechanistic models of the ecology of viruses in wastewater treatment systems. However, since we have shown that viruses can be related to effluent quality and virus quantification is simple and cheap, practitioners would probably benefit from quantifying viruses now.

AB The biological degradation of many trace organic compounds has been reported to be strongly redox dependent. The traditional characterization of redox conditions using the succession of inorganic electron acceptors such as dissolved oxygen and nitrate falls short in accurately describing the critical transition state between oxic and suboxic conditions. Novel monitoring strategies using intrinsic redox tracers might be suitable to close that gap. This study investigated the potential use of the successive biological transformation of the iodinated contrast medium iopromide as an intrinsic tracer of prevailing redox conditions in biofiltration systems. Iopromide degradation in biofiltration systems was monitored by quantifying twelve known biological transformation products formed under oxic conditions. A novel dimensionless parameter (T-IOP) was introduced as a measure for the successive transformation of iopromide. A strong correlation between the consumption of dissolved oxygen and iopromide transformation emphasized the importance of general microbial activity on iopromide degradation. However, results disproved a direct correlation between oxic (>1 mg/L O-2) and suboxic (<1 mg/L O-2) conditions and the degree of iopromide transformation. Results indicated that besides redox conditions also the availability of biodegradable organic substrate affects the degree of iopromide transformation. Similar behavior was found for the compounds gabapentin and benzotriazole, while the oxic degradation of metoprolol remained stable under varying substrate conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A novel Ag/4-Br/Bi2O3 composite photocatalyst was prepared by the hydrothermal and photodeposition method, and characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM and UV-vis analysis, respectively. The results indicated that the nanoparticles of Ag were successfully deposited on the surface of 4-Br/Bi2O3 composite. The as-prepared sample of Ag/4-Br/Bi2O3 showed higher photocatalytic activity than that of pure Bi2O3 or 4-Br/Bi2O3 through photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) under visible light. The enhanced photocatalytic activity could be attributed to the expansion of photoresponse range and the acceleration of carriers transmit caused by loading of Ag nanoparticles. Additionally, a possible photocatalytic mechanism of the Ag/4-Br/Bi2O3 composite was put forward. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Surface modification of nonconductor fabric substrate for enhancing electrical conductivity is a desirable work of flexible wearable devices. In our work, silver conductive layer with sandwich micro-structure was decorated on polyester fabric, and such a sandwich micro-structure layer is composed of the inner polyurethane (PU) as the interface binder, the filling layer of the precipitating silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as the conductive path via in-situ chemical synthesis, the outer PU layer as the shielding layer. The obtained sandwich micro-structure PET fabric possessed six orders of magnitude higher conductivity than that of the case without sandwich micro-structure. Such marvelous increasing conductivity can be attributed to the "silver colloid effect" which is deemed as approximation of conductive principle of silver conductive adhesives. The present study provides a potential strategy and theoretical basis for the preparation of low concentration silver conductive fabrics. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Treatment of bone defects requires materials or bone cement with superior mechanical properties and favorable biological properties, but this remains unachievable to date. To address this issue, the present study aimed to synthesize and characterize a novel poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bone cement containing monticellite (Mon) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for bone defect treatment. Considerably better mechanical properties were noted in the PMMA-Mon-CNT vs. PMMA and PMMA-Mon bone cements due to the unique resistance of CNTs to crack formation and propagation. Favorable bioactivity was also found in the bone cements containing Mon and CNTs, whereas the PMMA bone cement presented poor bioactivity. Specifically, the incorporation of Mon and CNTs into the PMMA matrix promoted the attachment of MG63 cells compared to the PMMA cement. Thus, the PMMA-Mon-CNT bone cements developed are good potential candidates for filling bone defects in orthopedic surgeries. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The mixed sols of TiO2 with different crystallinity and hollow rod-like MgF2 were here prepared using the solvothermal method. The anti-reflective coatings were prepared by the immersion pulling method. The coating does not require calcination treatment and the average light transmittance reaches 98.3% in the visible range of 400-800 nm. At the same time, the coating exhibits excellent self-cleaning properties (photocatalysis, super-hydrophilic, and anti-fog) and mechanical properties (hardness, substrate adhesion, and scratch resistance). The coatings have the advantage of durability in harsh environments, and they also take easily to heat-labile polymer optical materials such as resins. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study is to develop a novel functional composite nanofiber (FCN) loaded beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) and simvastatin (SIM) FCN mat for bone tissue regeneration. The advantage of electrospinning technique was considered for the uniform distribution of beta-TCP and SIM drug. In vitro drug release study performed in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) showed the controlled and sustained release of SIM, and the Kopcha model was used to investigate the drug release mechanism. The morphology of the electrospun nanofibers was investigated using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Assessment of the in vitro bioactivity of the nanofibers was carried out in simulated body fluid (SBF). FE-SEM and EDS analysis confirmed the formation of an apatite-like layer. Moreover, in vitro studies revealed that the FCN mat displayed better cell proliferation and adhesion than merely control fiber. This suggests versatile applications of the fabricated FCN mat for control drug delivery and bone tissue regeneration application. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Sn4+ doped FeOCl has been successfully synthetized as a sunlight-driven photo-Fenton catalyst, which shows that the catalytic activity of Sn4+/FeOCl (1.08% Sn4+ in the Sn4+/FeOCl) is a factor of 11.8 time higher than that of FeOCl. The doping of Sn4+ in FeOCl increases the optical adsorption and surface area of FeOCl. The decreased chemical bond strength of Fe-Cl in Sn4+/FeOCl effectively increases the number of exposed active sites (Fe-site and Sn-site), which boosts the production of center dot OH radicals. The Sn-site shows higher catalytic activity than Fe-site. A synergistic mechanism for Sn4+/FeOCl is proposed for the enhanced catalytic performance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ag3PO4 quantum dots depositing on TNTs were synthesized via a precipitation method. By using this nano-composite as the photocatalyst, tetracycline (a typical model pollutant) could be degraded efficiently under visible light, and 90% of tetracycline was removed in 8 min. The rapid degradation of tetracycline might be attributed to both the introduction of Ti3+ and the highly efficient separation of electrons and holes resulted from the photocatalytic mechanism of "Z" scheme.

AB Red phosphorus (P) with high theoretical capacity and cost-efficiency shows tremendous potential as high-performance anode material. Here, we designed hierarchical porous carbon nanofibers (HPCNFs) by electro-blown spinning of polyvinyl alcohol/polytetrafluoroethylene (PVA/PTFE) with following car-bonization and then encapsulated P into this HPCNFs via vaporization-condensation. The P-HPCNFs anodes presented a promising cyclability with reversible capacity of 883 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles and rate performance of 606 mAh g(-1) at 1 Ag-1. The improvement of electrochemical performance for P-HPCNFs could result from unique nanostructure, in which HPCNFs ensured not only the high conductivity of electrons but also the stable structural integrity. Additionally, the designed hierarchical pore structure with sufficient surface area well accommodated the volume change and highly facilitated the access of electrolyte to active P.

The magnetic core was selectively etched to generate a hollow metal-organic framework superstructure. The physical and chemical properties were characterized by TEM and SEM techniques, composition by SEM-EDX. Benefit from the efficient mass transfer and enhanced active sites accessibility, the hollow SiO2@UiO-66-NH2 composite showed higher or comparable catalytic activity than the nano-sized UiO-66-NH2 in the Knoevenagel condensation as a solid basic catalyst. Furthermore, it could be recovered and stable in terms of activity and structure when recycled for at least four times. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB WS2 nanodots-modified TiO2 nanotubes (TNT/WND) composites were fabricated via one-pot hydrothermal method for the first time. The physical and photophysical properties of the as-prepared photocatalysts were characterized by XRD, TEM, HRTEM, BET, UV-vis, and PL. The results demonstrated that WS2 nanodots have been successfully anchored on the inner wall of TiO2 nanotubes. TNT/WND composites showed excellent photocatalytic activity toward photodegradation of rhodamine B (RhB) under visible-light, which mainly attributed to the synergistic effect from relative low recombination rate of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs and high specific surface area.

A high areal capacitance value of 17 mF cm(-2) (50 F g(-1)) was obtained at a scan rate of 100 mV s(-1) in a 3-electrode cell configuration. Furthermore, this 3D hybrid nanostructure was analyzed by electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) to correlate the interfacial ionic exchange mechanisms to their electrochemical performance.

AB We have elucidated the determining role of high magnetic field on low-temperature nanostructured bainite transformation at an isothermal temperature of 300 degrees C. The application of 12 Tesla magnetic field increased the bainite volume percentage by 193% and 106% after isothermal treatment at 300 degrees C for 1 and 5 h, respectively. It indicated that low-temperature nanostructured bainite transformation is significantly accelerated by a high magnetic field. The magnetic moment of bainitic ferrite was 1.99 mu(B) under the condition of high magnetic field and 300 degrees C. Thus, the magnetic Gibbs free energy of bainite under 12 Tesla is -133.90 J/mol, leading to increase in the driving force for transformation of austenite to bainite transformation.

AB Defects in crystal structure of layered material can modify the surface states. Ion bombardment is a simple way to introduce defects into a crystal lattice in the surface region. Comprehensive scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and photoemission studies are presented to uncover the impact of ion etching and thermal annealing on the atomic and electronic structure of Sb (1 1 1) surface. We reveal the unusual behavior of the Sb(1 1 1) surface after Ar+ sputtering at 300 K (RT). The 3 nm-sized terraces formed even after a prolonged ion bombardment are established by LEED. Also, an increase in density of states (DOS) at the Fermi edge is detected for the etched Sb(1 1 1) surface due to the ruptured covalent bonds (CBs). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB TiO2 nanotube and TiO2-ZnO composite photocatalysts were fabricated by simple hydrothermal method, and the photocatalytic property of as-prepared samples were analyzed by the photo degradation of rhodamine B water solutions under visible light irradiation. The prepared TiO2-ZnO composite photocatalysts exhibited excellent property in photo degradation of rhodamine B water solution, which is better than that of P25. The enhancement photocatalytic property of target photocatalysts could be attributed to the reduced band gap energy, the enhanced-surface physic-chemical properties, the separation of photo induced electron-hole pairs and the decreased recombination rate. In addition, TiO2-ZnO composite photocatalysts showed good stability for rhodamine B photo degradation under visible light. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Graphene aerogel with well-distributed CoO nanoparticles (CoO@GA) has been subtly fabricated by using methylamine as a multifunctional agent through hydrothermal and calcination processes for the degradation of chloramphenicol (CAP). The results showed that CoO@GA containing 27.3 wt% of CoO nanoparticles with size ranging from 30 to 60 nm exhibited high mechanical elastic property. The cyclic compression testing with strain up 50% showed CoO@GA can completely recover to its original form after compression. Compared with bare CoO, Co2+ or GA, CoO@GA performed the best degradation efficiency for CAP (95.8%) in the presence of peroxymonosulfate (PMS). Quenching experiment indicated HO center dot and O2(center dot) were the main active radicals generated in the CoO@GA-PMS system. The recycled experiments showed CoO@GA had stable efficiency (above 82.8%) within 9 times for the degradation of CAP. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID GENERATION
AB Recently, a variety of artificial structures have been designed and fabricated to improve energy conversion efficiency. Lotus leaf, a kind of living organism, is famous for its hydrophobic structure on the surface, but here it's used for solar thermal conversion by changing its surface structure. SEM, XRD, HRTEM, FLIR, Raman and BET results demonstrated that carbonized lotus leaf became hydrophilic. In the evaporation process under a lamp illumination, the mass changed as high as 3.10 kg/(m(2)h), and the temperature increased to 60.1 degrees C. These findings not only reveal the potential to treat lotus leaf as a low-cost material for solar water evaporation, but also provide inspiration for the future development of high-performance solar thermal conversion devices.

AB Titanium dioxide (TiO2) which could photocatalytically decompose organic pollutants in water, is deposited on an UV emitting substrate which is made from Ca2MgSi2O7:Ce-3(+) phosphors, for the purpose of better photon utilization and prevention of the suspension forming. The TiO2 powder distributes homogeneously on the substrate, which could absorb the photons passing through the TiO2 layer and generate a secondary emission with wavelength of 380 nm. This secondary emission could excite the TiO2 again, and then promote the photocatalytic efficiency to organic dyes degradation because of the improvement of photon utilization.

AB Improvement of the mechanical properties of epoxy resins (EP), which are used as neutron shielding materials for spent nuclear fuel casks, is becoming very important. In this paper, as representative metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), nanosized UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2 were successfully introduced into epoxy resin (EP) by solution casting approach, afford MOF/EP composites, to enhance the mechanical properties. Results clearly showed that MOFs play a vital role in toughening EP-based nanocomposites, and the functioned amino-groups matter the most. Three underlying toughening mechanisms were proposed, which may provide deep understanding of the structure-activity relationship in MOF/polymer composites for radiation shielding application or other academic research.

AB ZnO/graphene oxide core-shell nanoparticles (ZGNPs) were prepared by via in-situ chemical synthesis and electrolysis. This report addresses the disagreement in the photocatalytic and photoluminescence behavior in this system. XRD, Raman, HRTEM, PL and UV-Vis were able to confirm ZnO nanoparticles and core-shell structures formation at various temperatures. A little shift was observed in Raman for ZGNPs after conjugating. PL showed a few peaks that were not related to the graphene, which depends on the synthesis route and defects. After conjugating between ZnO and Graphene, two mechanisms are suggested. The first is band structure modification in the boundary of core and shell. The second one is diffusion of functional group in GO as a dopant on ZnO surface. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB We have developed a simple top down technique for preparing GaN porous templates with high single-crystallinity by high-temperature nitridation of beta-Ga2O3 films. The GaN template converted from beta-Ga2O3 film contains many voids and exhibits good-crystallinity with (0 0 2) orientation. The results confirm that the GaN porous template is stress-free, and the re-nitridation can effectively improve the crystal quality and luminescence properties of the GaN template. A similar to 100 mu m GaN thick film has been grown on the GaN porous template by halide vapor phase epitaxy, and self-separation of the GaN thick film from the sapphire substrate has been successfully achieved.

AB We studied the magnetoresistance effects in Co/Cu/Ni spin-valves with magnetic fields along different in-plane directions. When the magnetic easy axis directions of Co and Ni layers are parallel, only typical positive magnetoresistance effects were discovered. Interestingly, a magnetoresistance sign inverse was discovered in the spin-valve with different magnetic easy axis directions between Co and Ni layers. This anomalous behavior may be related to the multi-step magnetization reversal processes in these materials. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a series of CdS/g-C3N4 nanocomposites with varying wt% CdS were prepared via an in-situ hydrothermal synthesis method. 10 wt% CdS/g-C3N4 nanocomposites displayed the highest rate of hydrogen evolution via photocatalytic water splitting. The H-2 evolution rate of 10 wt% CdS/g-C3N4 is 21 times greater than pure g-C3N4 and 4 times greater than that of pure CdS. Key factors responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the improved charge separation and increased surface area of CdS/g-C3N4 nanocomposites. These findings may serve as a platform for the fabrication of other photocatalytic multi-material nanocomposites in the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The frequent oil spill accidents in nowadays has aroused great attention all over the world. Superhydrophobic and superoleophilic grafted on various substrates have attracted much attention to treat oil and water mixture because of their unique performance that can effectively separate oil and water mixture. At the same time, ceramic membrane also shows potential substrates to be used in treating oil and water mixture. However, conventional ceramic membrane that made from alumina show drawbacks in term of its high cost production. Herein, we report a new ceramic membrane that derived from agricultural-sugarcane bagasse waste and modified into superhydrophobic and superoleophilic to act as hybrid oil sorbent and separator. In this study, we successfully treat three types of real oil and water mixture from palm oil mill effluent (POME), restaurant and car wash with oil rejection and flux up to 99% and 134 L/m(2)h, respectively.

AB Porous alumina/mullite membrane supports (PAMS) were prepared by using direct foaming as pore foaming method, and silica sol-gel, combined with tape-casting, as a shaping method. The supports displayed a smooth surface and a porous internal structure, with spherical pores of 50-200 mu m in diameter and interconnecting pores of similar to 10 mu m in diameter. The supports sintered at 1600 degrees C exhibited a high bending strength of 13.4 +/- 0.7 MPa, an open porosity of 72.8%, and excellent N-2 and water permeation (4.5 x 10(7) and 4.1 x 10(5) Lm(-2) h(-1) bar(-1), respectively), which qualify them for further consideration in several practical applications.

AB In the present communication we report the electro catalytic performance of non-precious monometallic catalysts (Ni and Co), synthesized by sol-gel method and homogeneously dispersed on titanium sub-oxide carrier. Morphology and surface structure of the catalysts were studied. Membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) with anion exchange membrane (AEM), comprising para-polybenzimidazole, highly doped with potassium hydroxide, were prepared using these catalysts. The MEA electrochemical performance and catalytic activity toward the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) are investigated in a self-designed electrolysis test cell. The results obtained show low overpotentials for both OER and HER compared to a MEA with Pt catalyst and the same membrane, as well as stable performance in the temperature range up to 80 degrees C. The current density reaches 0.2 A.cm(-2) at cell voltage of 2.0 V. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The removal of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is one of the most significant and challenging goal in environmental treatment field due to its toxicity and potential carcinogenicity. In this study, a waste grape-fruit endothelium was selected as a low-cost, green and recyclable biomass material to be modified by iron ion and polyaniline (PANI) using biosorption-pyrolysis to obtain a novel biochar material (C-Fe-PANI), characterized by XPS, XRD and SEM. C-Fe-PANI was found to exhibit excellent removal capacity with Cr(VI) as a probe contaminant and the removal rate reached almost 100% in 135 min. Remarkably, a significant enhancement of the removal performance was found with the introduction of iron ion and PANI, which could be attributed to the synergistic effect of PANI and iron ion. This study provides a new perspective insight for the removal of Cr(VI) in the environmental field. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Effect of cryogenic treatment on amorphous phase rejuvenation in Al-based alloys was studied by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. It was shown that cryogenic cycling of partially crystalline samples of Al88Ni6Y6 and Al87Ni8Gd5 alloys leads to a decrease in a nanocrystalline phase fraction. After cryogenic cycling of partially crystalline Al88Ni6Y6 alloy the amount of the nanocrystalline phase reduces with no signs of the crystalline phase being observed after 100 treatment cycles in the temperature range of 77-293 K.

ID BREAKDOWN STRENGTH
AB Cavities are widely spread inside the polyetherimide which is a super engineering plastic. As the main source of partial discharge, they may lead to the tree-like breakdown and insulation failure of material. With the 30 MHz ultrasonic scanning microscope, the cavities of single sample and batch samples are identified and characterized. Small cavities (1-5 pixels) occupy more than 95% of all cavities for a typical sample. The mean area, total area and cavity number of each batch are closer to normal distribution. By the improved experimental system, the breakdown characteristic and insulation life of samples are tested. The cavities scanning from the front and back sides increased by 31% and 41% respectively after breakdown. The normalized insulation life is reduced by nearly 36 times as the mean cavity area increased by only 2 times. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cu-Al-Ni shape memory alloys have good thermal stability and shape memory properties, but mechanical working of these alloys is very difficult due to inter-granular fracture and brittleness. This paper deals with improvement of shape memory properties and ductility of these alloys with the addition of boron. It was observed that with addition of boron in a designed experiment, ductility improved by more than four times than that of the base alloy. In addition, shape memory properties also improved significantly. These results obtained are discussed in this paper systematically. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The ZnO/tourmaline composite was synthesized by a facile precipitation-hydrothermal method. The composite showed significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity towards degradation of methylene blue (MB) compared with pure ZnO. The degradation rate maintained 90.8% after five successive photocatalytic reaction cycles in the presence of the composite. The results indicated that the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the composite was ascribed to the exposed active sites originated from the improved specific surface area, good interaction between ZnO and tourmaline, and furthermore, tourmaline's ability of leading the photo-induced e transferred directionally to achieve separation of e /h(+) pairs. As an earth-abundant polar mineral, tourmaline had potential application in the photocatalytic field. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A promising strategy to synergistically improve the water resistance, wet strength and UV-blocking property of cellulose nanofiber (CNF) nanopaper via layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly of aramid nanofiber (ANF) film was proposed. The water resistance, optical properties and mechanical performances (in dry and wet states) of the resultant CNF@ANF hybrid nanopapers were investigated. The results show that CNF@ANF nanocomposites display excellent water resistance, wet strength and UV-blocking properties. Especially, the wet strength of CNF@ANF(10) paper reached 101 MPa after soaked in water for 24 h, which was 86 times higher than pure CNF nanopaper, representing one of the strongest CNF-based hybrid nanopapers in fully wet conditions, which will be favorable for the potential advanced applications.

ID MAGNESIUM SUBSTITUTION
AB Newberyite (MgHPO4 center dot 3H(2)O) is an important component of magnesium phosphate materials and has significant potential foreground in biomaterial field due to its high chemical stability, biocompatibility and biodegradability. However, newberyite has received lesser attention compare with other magnesium phosphate materials. Nonaqueous synthetic routes to oxide and phosphate materials provide certain advantages, such as a better control of nucleation and crystal growth and higher crystallinity at low temperature. To the best of our knowledge, newberyite synthesized in nonaqueous system has no relevant literature record. Therefore, we report a new method to synthesis newberyite, using MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O as magnesium source and H3PO4 as phosphorous source in nonaqueous system.

AB A novel rolling process characterized by multi-pass bi-axial reduction was proposed. An 800 MPa class low-carbon steel bar with ultrafine elongated-grain structures was fabricated using bi-axial rolling at a warm working temperature, and tensile and three-point bending tests were conducted at a temperature range from 77 K to 473 K. The texture in the developed steel bar was dominated by {0 0 1}< 0 0 1 > cube orientations. The toughness-strength balance of the developed steel was remarkably improved compared with that of conventional 0.15%C ferrite-pearlite steel and 0.29%C martensitic steel. The toughness reached its maximum when crack branching started to appear upon decreasing the test temperature, and the specimen did not separate into two pieces even at low temperature of 77 K. A microstructural design that improves toughness in steel was demonstrated. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Superhard CrB2 coatings with hardness around 45.7 +/- 1.6 GPa were deposited on cemented carbide sub-strates via a direct current magnetron sputtering at the deposition temperature of 300 degrees C. The composition, microstructure and corrosion resistance of the deposited coatings were investigated. The results revealed that the deposited CrB2 coating had a preferred (0 01) orientation and dense nanocolumnar structure. The great improvement in corrosion resistance of CrB2 coated substrate was obviously observed from potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The formation of Cr2O3 was supposed to be the key factor for the obvious passivation phenomenon. Consequently, the corrosion current density was reduced by 100-fold in combination with a higher polarization resistance compared with the pristine substrate. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Diffusion bonding of Zircaloy-4 and 304L stainless steel (SS) was carried out using Ti and Ag as multiple interlayers at 800 degrees C under 12 MPa for 15-120 min. Microstructure and mechanical properties of the joints were investigated. The results showed that the interface zone of the joints consisted of 304L SS substrate, Ag interlayer, alpha-Ag + TiAg layer, Ti interlayer, Ti(Zr) solid-solution layer, Zr(Ti) solid-solution layer and Zircaloy-4 substrate. The shear strength of the joints increased firstly and then decreased with increasing bonding time, and the maximum shear strength of 165.7 MPa was reached for 90 min. Although there was TiAg IMCs formed in the joints, which did not lead to hardening of the joints. The layer growth for alpha-Ag + TiAg layer, Ti(Zr) layer and Zr(Ti) layer is diffusion limited growth.

AB Herein, a bio-inspired, environmentally benign synthetic strategy has been developed for CuSnO3 quantum dots and its photocatalytic efficiency towards degradation of Rabeprazole has been investigated. The synthesized nanomaterials were characterized by UV-Vis, XRD, XPS and TEM techniques. The elliptical CuSnO3 QDs have sizes less than 3.8 +/- 0.3 nm. The results of photocatalytic degradation of Rabeprazole under solar irradiation revealed the synergistic effect of double oxide nanoheterojunction. The kinetics of the photodegradation process was found to be of pseudo first order with rate constant 6.3 x 10(2) min(1). The effect of pH on the degradation efficiency and reusability of the catalyst were also thoroughly investigated. The degradation products have been identified using HRLCMS technique and degradation pathway has been proposed. The sunlight harvesting capability of tuned band structured CuSnO3 QDs have lead to the efficient degradation of Rabeprazole under solar irradiation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Protective Ni-based coatings for stainless steel current collectors of the planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) were developed and tested during 21,000 h in contact with lanthanum-strontium manganite cathode material. The compositional and microstructural alterations due to interdiffusion between Ni coating, La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 electrode and commercial Crofer 22 APU steel after long-term testing under the SOFC cathodic conditions, were studied. The results of micro-Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy analyses showed a dominant role of Mn and Fe diffusion into the protective coating, leading to the formation of NiFe2O4 and MnFe2O4. Although Mn deficiency in the manganite cathode may decrease electrical conductivity, its impact on the overall contact resistance is insignificant. The Ni-based coatings were found to decrease area-specific interfacial resistivity down to 3-4 mOhm x cm(2) for, at least, 21,000 h (>2.5 years) at 1123 K, atmospheric oxygen pressure and current density of 0.5 A/cm(2).

Aiming at exploring strengthening effects of CNTs on the hollow microlattice materials, NiP-CNT based hollow microlattice materials with density ranging from 35 to 98 kg/m(3) were fabricated by means of combining additive manufacturing, composite electroless plating and template etching. In-situ compression tests were conducted. In comparison, elastic moduli and compressive strengths of Ni-P hollow microlattices were improved by a factor of 2.4-2.6 and 2.0-2.9, respectively, by introduction of CNTs. The enhancement of mechanical performance was attributed to the interaction between Ni-P amorphous material and CNTs by load transfer and shear band strengthening mechanisms. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, gliadin particles (GPs) prepared by an in situ method was used as fillers to construct chitosan (CS)-based biocomposite films. Tannic acid (TA) was used as the stabilizer and modifier for the CS/gliadin composites. The micrographs of composites indicated that the addition of TA into the CS/gliadin composites changed the shapes of GPs from oval to sphere and decreased the particle size of GPs in the composites. The TA could also act as a bridge to link the GPs and CS in the composites and enhance the interactions between the GPs and CS matrix. As a result, the tensile strength of CS/gliadin composites was enhanced by the addition of TA. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Highly orientated poly(beta-hydroxybutyrate)/multiwalled carbon nanotubes (PHB/MWCNTs) composite nanofiber membrane scaffold was fabricated by electrospinning followed by hot-stretching treatment. X-ray diffraction confirmed the presence of MWCNTs in the structure of PHB/MWCNTs composite. Compared with neat PHB nanofiber scaffold, PHB/MWCNTs composite nanofiber scaffolds contained higher content of beta-form crystals. The measured piezoelectric charge constant and induced electrical potentials generated on the surface of the nanofiber scaffolds indicated that addition of MWCNTs to PHB nanofiber matrix and hot-stretching treatment contributed to improving piezoelectric performances of PHB. The developed PHB/MWCNTs composite 'smart' nanofiber membrane is applicable for biomedical field, electronic sensors and actuators. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) coatings containing equiaxed grains and columnar grains were prepared by plasma spraying. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technology was firstly conducted to investigate effects of the grain shape on residual strain/stresses in as-sprayed YSZ coatings. It was found that equiaxed grains have larger strain capabilities than columnar grains and YSZ coatings with more equiaxed grains exhibited greater residual stresses than those with more columnar grains. It might be attributed to the higher temperature gradients existing in equiaxed grains caused by a higher cooling rate. Therefore, YSZ thermal barrier coatings with more columnar grains have a longer lifetime, which might be attributed to lower residual stresses in the columnar grains. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, the effects of alkali treatment on the chemical composition and thermal decomposition of Acacia planifrons fibers were investigated. The fibers originating from the bark of an Acacia planifrons tree were alkali treated with various concentrations (2% and 5% w/v) for 30 min. The treatment was found to diminish the amorphous contents, improve the crystallinity index and thermal stability of the fiber. The crystallinity index of the untreated, 2% alkali-treated and 5% alkali-treated fibers was estimated to be 65.38%, 69.94% and 74.76%, respectively. The thermal stability of the alkali-treated fiber was quite higher than that of the untreated fiber. The results revealed that 5% alkali-treated Acacia planifrons fibers are suitable to be used as reinforcement in polymer composites. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we developed a solvothermal method and subsequent heat treatment route to synthesize a novel porous structure of MgCo2O4 assembled by secondary ultrafine nanoparticles. Such a porous structure can effectively promote the infiltration of electrolyte and MgCo2O4 nanoparticles, thus increasing the electrochemical reaction sites of the MgCo2O4 electrode during the charge/discharge process. Correspondingly, when tested as anode materials for Lithium ion batteries, the porous MgCo2O4 electrode delivered a high specific capacity of 824 mAh g(-1) after 150 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g(-1). Even at the high current density of 2000 mA g(-1), a reversible capacity of 543 mAh g(-1 )can be achieved after 350 cycles showing excellent cycle stability. Hence, the porous network architecture MgCo2O4 is promising electrode materials for Lithium ion battery applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The sintering mechanism of novel SiO2-Al2O3-CaO-MgO ceramics obtained from red mud was studied using two batches of ceramics mixed with 50 wt% red mud. The sintering behavior and mechanical properties were studied, and crystal evolution was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), especially in situ XRD. Results showed that anorthite with Na+-solidification played the role of flux to reduce the optimal sintering temperature of ceramics by about 50 degrees C (1080 degrees C for ceramic sample #2), whereas hematite, residual quartz, and generated pyroxene formed the skeleton phase in ceramics during high temperature sintering. Formation of more pyroxene in ceramics improved the bending strength (115.88 MPa for ceramic sample #1). Slow cooling was beneficial to precipitate more pyroxene and less anorthite during sintering. This research is of special interest for the utilization of red mud in ceramics. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

It has been found that in ELO diamond layer densities of NV0 and NV center above the tungsten metal are enhanced. Meanwhile, in patterned high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) substrate the density of NV center beneath the tungsten metal is much higher than that of NV0.

AB A ternary photocatalyst, graphene based bismuth modified bismuth(III) oxybromide (Bi/BiOBr/G), was synthesized via a facile one-step solvothermal method using only ethylene glycol as both solvent and reducing reagent. Bi/BiOBr/G exhibits higher photocatalytic activity than bismuth(III) oxybromide (BiOBr) on degradation of Rhodamine B under visible-light illumination, and the photodegradation rate is 4.9 times that of BiOBr. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the synergistic effect among Bismuth, graphene and BiOBr, which can effectively promote the visible-light absorption of Bi/BiOBr/G and the separation of photogenerated charge carriers. The conditions influencing the photocatalytic performance of Bi/BiOBr/G were also investigated in detail, as well as the photocatalytic mechanism of the degradation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ID MICROSTRUCTURE
AB We report a novel strategy that can enhance the mechanical performance of Al0.5CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) with high pulse magnetic field (PMF) using 10 T field intensity versus different pulse times at room temperature. Results show that the yield strength (sigma(0.2)) and ultimate tensile strength (sigma(b)) of Al0.5CoCrFeNi are typically improved with the increasing of pulse times, which respectively increase by 22% and 20% after 20 times of pulse field treatment. Microstructure characterization shows no substantial changes in the micro-scale. However, high density dislocations are found in the FCC-phase dendrites after PMF treatment, which is the main reason for the enhancement of the mechanical properties. Our results show that the PMF treatment can efficiently tune the mechanical properties of HEA at room temperature without any thermal-mechanical treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Graphene functionalization helps to improve the barrier property of graphene-reinforced coatings, however, it may also increase the electrical conductivity of coatings and result in galvanic corrosion between coating and metal. To demonstrate that fine-tuned functionalization of graphene is vital for its applications in metal protection, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with various functionalization degree was precisely prepared. Compared with pristine rGO, rGO with a low functionalization degree possesses an enhanced corrosion promotion activity (CPA), and rGO with a high functionalization degree exhibits an inhibited CPA. Critical functionalization degree for inhibiting the CPA of rGO/epoxy nanocomposite coatings was determined. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Content of solid, dispersant and thickener was adjusted to achieve slurries with shear-thinning behavior. Cr2AlC foams were successfully obtained after two consecutive infiltrations, followed by two thermal processes, first in air to burn-out the polymeric foams and then in argon to consolidate the porous structure.

AB High purity magnesium (HP-Mg) was studied as a candidate biodegradable material for biliary and urinary stents. Electrochemical measurements and immersion tests were conducted to compare the in vitro degradation behavior of HP-Mg in modified simulated body fluid (m-SBF), artificial urine and human bile. We showed that HP-Mg corroded more uniformly and much slower in bile than in m-SBF and artificial urine, slower corrosion rate resulting in a small amount of corrosion products which are mainly amorphous probably will not cause problem such as biliary occlusion, suggesting Mg and its alloys may be a potential material for biliary stents. In terms of corrosion products, crystalized minerals such as Mg2CO3(OH)(2)center dot 3H(2)O, CaHPO4 center dot 2H(2)O and hydroxyapatite which may be the precursors of ureteral stones were deposited on HP-Mg after immersion in artificial urine, but not in bile or m-SBF, which suggested a potential risk of urolithiasis when using the bared HP-Mg as a urinary stent.

AB The 2D binary heterostructured ZnO/ZnS sheets were prepared via a hydro-thermal synthesis method. The X-ray diffraction results illustrated that ZnS was successfully formed on ZnO sheets. The images captured by field emission scanning electron microscopy showed the granular structure with fine particles on the surface, which increases the contact area between dye solution and catalysts. The EDS spectrum suggested that the surface of the heterojunction was almost entirely coated with ZnS. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra clarified that the ultraviolet and visible absorption of heterostructure were both enhanced. These results all contribute to the efficient methyl orange degradation with the degradation rate of 83% in 4 h under direct sunlight. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB A novel approach to accelerate greatly and simplify the determination of creep properties in metals is presented. The method combines advanced digital image correlation, thermal imaging, and conductive graded heating to produce and analyse viscoplastic deformation in a continuous range of temperatures at constant stresses. By differentiating the strain across small sections of the sample at different temperatures, one may extract the creep behaviour at many different temperatures and thus derive the activation energy. Just a single test and specimen is needed to make a first reasonable estimate. The method is suitable for all metals and alloys but is validated here for a prototype Ni-based single superalloy.

AB The effect of phosphor on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of TCA heterostructure based solar cell is reported here. ZnS:Cu, the phosphor, converts a fraction of ultraviolet energy of solar light into visible region which leads to an enhancement in the PCE. TiO2 nanoparticles having spherical morphology were synthesized by a facile microwave treatment and CdS, Ag2S and ZnS:Cu quantum dots (QDs) were grown on the TiO2 by Successive Ionic Layer Adsorption and Reaction (SILAR) method by optimizing the Cu concentration. J-V measurements on TiO2/CdS/Ag2S/ZnS:Cu (1%) structure based solar cell show an enhancement in the efficiency of 70% compared to TiO2/CdS/Ag2S/ZnS based cell which is due to the cascade arrangement of this structure helps to increasing the charge transfer rates, extension of the photoabsorption range and reduction of recombination.

AB Melt Conditioning Twin Roll Casting (MC-TRC) of magnesium AZ31 alloy sheets were subjected to cold rolling at room temperature. It was observed that 13.8% thickness reductions were obtained without any cracks. In the case of MC-TRC sample a strong texture was observed which suggested orientation of basal plane towards the rolling direction during the casting process and hence deformation at cold condition was possible. Detailed optical microscopic investigations were carried out for homogenized cold rolled MC-TRC samples. Heat treatment of MC-TRC sample was done at 400 degrees C and it was observed that fine equiaxed grain structure obtained in 12.5 min. Tensile testing at 200 degrees C of cold rolled heat treated (HTCR) MC-TRC samples were performed and compared to the commercially available AZ31 TRC samples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB The global process of strengthening and harmonization of intellectual property rights (IPRs) systems has been intensified in the last twenty five years by the signing of trade agreements (TAs) that include chapters with intellectual property (IP) provisions and other trade-related issues. This paper provides a first exploration of whether and how the signing of TAs with IP chapters influences bilateral trade flows for a balanced panel of 110 countries and the period 1995-2013. We address methodological issues related to the assessment of the effect of TAs on bilateral trade. We use matching econometrics to evaluate the treatment of TAs with and without IP chapters. In addition, we estimate the effects of TAs on bilateral trade in a more dynamic fashion using a panel data approach based on the gravity model. Also, we perform our analysis for trade in low- and high-IP intensive products. We found that both types of TAs increase bilateral trade but TAs with no IPRs chapters have a stronger positive effect on trade. However, if we include lags to consider that TAs with IP chapters might need a longer implementation time, the net expected increase on trade is similar for both types of TAs. We also found that the effects depend on the development level of countries and on the IP intensity of products. We found a clear positive effect for developed countries, but we do not observe important gains for developing countries in all sectors and to all destinations derived from TAs with IP chapters. This raises the question of whether trade gains can compensate the effort related with IP reforms.

AB While postdoctoral fellowships are viewed as positions that prepare PhD students for academic careers, studies show that most postdocs will not find tenure-track employment within universities. Postdocs consequently pursue non-academic jobs that differ in the degree to which they utilize a postdoc's scientific training, yet we know little about how this occurs. To help address this gap, this study inductively investigates factors that may influence a postdoc's transition to a non-academic career. The study uncovers multiple individual, PI, as well as organizational and policy factors, including the lack of relevant skills, absence of support-and in some cases opposition-from their principal investigators, and poor availability of non-academic career preparation opportunities, among others. Viewed collectively, these elements likely hinder a move to non-academic scientific positions and thus have consequences for postdoc career trajectories and, by extension, the utilization of new knowledge. The paper opens the door for future research, theorization, and policy action that might smooth the transition of postdocs into non-academic careers and potentially improve the impact of publicly-funded research.

AB We explore how a firm's knowledge structure characteristics and market identity-as reflected in its position in the industry value chain and market status-influence knowledge-based alliance (KBA) formation. We propose that a firm's propensity to form KBAs is affected by the congruence (or misalignment) between its knowledge structure characteristics (i.e., knowledge depth and scope) and the role it plays in the industry, as demanded by its position in the value chain. We further argue that while a firm's market status can amplify the positive effect of the congruence, thereby enhancing a firm's proclivity to form KBAs, being prominent can also hurt a firm when it faces a misalignment between its knowledge structure characteristics and externally induced expectations related to its value chain position. We validate our arguments using panel data on 1051 firm-year observations for 197 firms patenting in the global fuel cell industry for the period 1999-2009. By developing a richer understanding of the relationship between a firm's knowledge-based resources and KBA formation, we answer the call for a better understanding of how and when firms can leverage their internal knowledge configurations to improve their proclivity to form alliances.

AB Coopetition, i.e., cooperation between competing actors, has become a pervasive strategy for innovative firms. The primary focus of studies investigating coopetition centers on inter-firm relationships, highlighting the benefits, limits and configurational patterns of cooperative relationships between competing firms. Only a small, emerging group of studies seeks to extend the concept to the intra-firm level, stressing the existence and effects of competition and cooperation between units that are part of the same organization. This paper contributes to this latter group by investigating the effects of internal coopetition on knowledge and innovation sharing and highlighting the fundamental role of knowledge brokers in managing the resulting tensions. Based on a qualitative case study of the video game publisher Ubisoft, we stress how the tensions raised by internal coopetitive settings limit knowledge sharing between units, and we analyze the mechanisms through which the knowledge broker helps to overcome these limits. We identify three main functions of this knowledge broker that allow the promotion of knowledge and innovation transfer to occur between coopeting units: (1) protecting the unit's competitive advantage by introducing a lagging principle in the transfer process, (2) reducing sharing costs by standardizing innovative solutions, and (3) enhancing awareness of and trust in innovative solutions by centralizing knowledge diffusion.

AB There is a paucity of knowledge on research commercialization by university scientists worldwide. The objective of this paper is to identify the role that Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) and direct Industrial Funding play in university research commercialization in transition economies of Azerbaijan, Belarus and Kazakhstan during 2015-2017. We do this by developing a novel database and a multi-level model which explains how individual attributes, organizational and ecosystem characteristics explain the extent of knowledge commercialization.
   We apply the generalized Heckman approach to account for two selection biases, reducing the sample from 2602 to 272 scientists, and further use a mixed-method approach to analyse 27 face-to-face interviews with researchers and 170 managers. The results demonstrate that research commercialization is not associated with the existence and awareness of TTO or the establishment of commercialization contracts via TTO, but the direct industrial funding of university research. Taken together the findings have clear implications for scholars, scientific entrepreneurs, TTOs and investors who aim to exploit university knowledge in transition economies.

AB Management literature has identified high-skilled human capital as a crucial dimension of innovation processes at the firm level. In this study, we introduce an alternative view of human capital based on the tasks that firms workers perform. We propose a measure of cognitive analytical and interpersonal tasks: the degree of abstractism. We argue that the level of abstractism of a firm has an effect on a firm's propensity to innovate and on its product innovation performance. We hypothesize that while the degree of abstractism has a linear positive relationship with the propensity to innovate, the relationship between abstractism and product innovation performance follows an inverted u-shaped relationship. We find partial support to our hypotheses using data from more than six thousand Portuguese firms. We discuss how these results change our understanding of the relationship between human capital and innovation at the firm level.

AB Does technology require labour mobility to diffuse? To explore this, we use German social-security data and ask how plants that pioneer an industry in a location - and for which the local labour market offers no experienced workers - assemble their workforces. These pioneers use different recruiting strategies than plants elsewhere: they hire more workers from outside their industry and from outside their region, especially when workers come from closely related industries or are highly skilled. The importance of access to experienced workers is highlighted in the diffusion of industries from western Germany to the post-reunification economy of eastern German. While manufacturing employment declined in most advanced economies, eastern German regions managed to reindustrialise. The pioneers involved in this process relied heavily on expertise from western Germany: while establishing new manufacturing industries in the East, they sourced half of their experienced workers from the West.

AB This paper develops a history-friendly model of the process of catch-up by Chinese firms in the mobile communications industry. It aims to explain how the sectoral environment in terms of segmented markets and generational technological change facilitated the catch-up of domestic firms with respect to foreign multinationals. Segmented markets provided a nurturing environment in peripheral markets for the survival of domestic firms starting with low level capabilities in their infant stage. Generational technological change opened windows of opportunities for domestic firms to catch-up with foreign multinationals in new product segments. Segmented markets and generational technological change allowed domestic firms to leverage their initial advantages in peripheral markets to catch-up in core markets. Counterfactual simulations highlight that the process of catch-up was facilitated by relatedness across technological generations. This paper contributes to the literature on catch-up and industry evolution by illustrating the role of technological change and market regimes in the process of catching-up.

AB Research and development (R&D) is often essential for firms' profitability and growth. At the same time, R&D is long-term and risky. We show that innovation activities lead to information ambiguity about the future value of firms' assets. This effect appears to be more pronounced for small and less reputed firms. Information ambiguity further lowers firms' market value and, in particular, the market value of innovative assets. We further show that high quality patents mitigate the negative effect of information ambiguity to some extent.

AB Academic training, where senior scientists transfer their knowledge and skills to junior scientists through apprenticeship, plays a crucial role in the development of scientists. This study focuses on two aspects of academic training, autonomy and exploration, to investigate how different modes of training are incentivized and how they affect junior scientists' performance and career prospects. Drawing on a sample of 162 supervising professors and their 791 PhD students in life science labs in Japanese universities, this study suggests two fundamental conflicts in academic training. First, autonomy granted to PhD students under apprenticeship improves their long-term performance but decreases short-term performance. Because the latter effect costs supervisors, while the former does not benefit them in general, this inter-temporal tradeoff creates an incentive conflict between supervisors and students, inducing non-autonomous training. The short-term cost for supervisors can be compensated in the form of labor input or reputation gain from previous students in the long term, but this typically happens when students are trained with limited scope of exploration, which hinders the originality of students' knowledge production. This reduces the diversity of knowledge production, presenting another incentive conflict between individual scientists and the collective scientific community.

AB Adapting or supplanting production and distribution systems to accommodate new criteria of environmental sustainability entails the search for and the recombination of know-how from a variety of domains. How this process plays out in different areas depends crucially on the specific composition of local economic activities. This paper contributes this debate by analysing whether and to what extent regional industrial and occupational diversification affects the change in green employment across 363 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in the United States between 2006 and 2014. Our findings suggest that industrial unrelated variety within MSAs is a positive and significant predictor of green employment growth whereas related variety has very little impact. Conversely, both related and unrelated diversification across occupations are positively associated with green employment growth. The analysis also uncovers heterogeneity across existing, new and evolving green jobs.

AB This paper studies the effects of skilled migration on innovation -proxied by patent citations- in European industries between 1994 and 2005, using the French and the UK Labour Force Surveys and the German Microcensus. Highly-educated migrants have a positive effect on innovation, but the effect differs across industries. It is stronger in industries with low levels of overeducation, high levels of FDIs and openness to trade and, finally, in industries with higher ethnic diversity. The aggregate effect of the skilled immigrant is about one third the one of the skilled natives. We tackle the endogeneity of migrants with a set of external and internal instruments.

AB Although science parks are established globally for decades as an innovation policy instrument to foster growth and networking, there is limited attention given towards research into possible types within these real estate objects. Prior attempts in categorising science parks are characterised by the limited number of cases and/or variables. Science parks are believed to enhance innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic value for firms and regions. Past academic research showed mixed results on these performances and it is reasoned that distinct types within science parks exist that might explain these unclear results. We argue that before we can grasp what science parks can do, we should know what they are. Therefore, a survey on science park characteristics was completed by 82 science park managers in Europe. A cluster analysis was conducted which grouped the 82 participating science parks in three types; 'research', 'cooperative', and 'incubator' locations. Next, differences and similarities of these three types within science parks in Europe were analysed as a basis for advancing the academic debate. The types provide further understanding of science parks and offer researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers a means to compare, market, and benchmark science parks more adequately.

AB Adding to the literature on the recognition and spread of ideas, and alongside the bias against novelty view documented in prior research, we introduce the perspective that articles compete for the attention of researchers who might build upon them. We investigate this effect by analyzing more than 5.3 million research publications from 1970 to 1999 in the life sciences. In support of our competition for attention perspective, we show that articles covering rarely addressed topics tend to receive more citations and have a higher chance of being breakthrough papers as compared to articles on more popular topics. We also explore conditions under which these effects might vary by using decade subsamples, home-versus foreign-field forward citations, as well as short-, medium- and long-term time windows. Finally, we also find evidence consistent with the previously documented bias against novelty and show that both mechanisms can work simultaneously.

AB In this paper we study the effect of deregulation on innovation in the electricity sector using a sample of 31 OECD countries. Exploiting sharp reductions in the level of product market regulation, explicitly linked to changes in the legal framework, we perform a difference-in-difference analysis by matching data retrieved from the OECD International Regulation, OECD Patent Grants, and UN World Development Indicators databases. Our main findings suggest that a decrease in regulation intensity, following a significant reform, has a negative impact on patents (granted by the European Patent Office). This impact appears to be mainly due to the degree of market contestability. Finally, we find evidence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between regulation and innovation. This may imply that the effect of deregulation on innovation depends on the strength of the deregulatory process.

AB This paper explores the geography of academic engagement patterns of native and foreign-born academics, contrasting how patterns of intranational and international engagement with non-academic actors differ between these two groups. We suggest that foreign-born academics will engage more internationally than their native-born colleagues, whereas native-born academics will have greater levels of intranational engagement. Drawing upon a large multi-source dataset, including a major new survey of all academics working in the UK, we find support for the idea that where people are born influences how they engage with non-academic actors. We also find that these differences are attenuated by an individual's intranational and international experience, ethnicity and language skills. We explore the implications of these findings for policy to support intranational and international academic engagement.

AB Addressing sustainability and low carbon objectives calls for radical departures from existing socio-technical trajectories. The substantial implementation gap between sustainability objectives and current unsustainable paths justifies a continued search for more ambitious system transformations and clarity as to how they can be realised. The aim of this article is to unpack the feasibility of such sustainability transitions pathways (STPs), by identifying the analytical dimensions that need to be considered to address challenges for transitions governance and specifying how they can inform comprehensive evaluation efforts. We aim to offer practical examples of how multiple forms of knowledge can be mobilised to support strategic decision-making, and so complement traditional modelling-based scenario tools. We base our evaluation of STPs on a broad understanding of feasibility and elaborate a frame to mobilise what we see as three 'facets' of STPs: representations for exploring sustainability transitions potentials, as well as the conditions under which STPs may have greater chances of becoming realised. The resulting evaluation frame allow us to generate specific prescriptions about STPs feasibility that can focus interdisciplinary research on the relevance of mobilising a plurality of forms of knowledge in evaluation efforts, a more detailed understanding of the potential of a given solution or pathway, and more detailed assessment of different key dimensions. We end by discussing how the notion of STPs feasibility can help open up decision making processes and what tangible types of interventions are relevant.

AB There is sufficient evidence, drawn from surveys of innovation in the public sector and cognitive testing interviews with public sector managers, to develop a framework for measuring public sector innovation. Although many questions that are covered in the Oslo Manual guidelines for measuring innovation in the private sector can be applied with some modifications to the public sector, public sector innovation surveys need to meet policy needs that require collecting additional types of data. Policy to support public sector innovation requires data on how public sector organizations innovate and how a strategic management approach to innovation can influence the types of innovations that are developed. Both issues require innovations surveys to delve deeply into the innovation processes and strategies that are used by public sector managers. Implementation of the measurement framework proposed in this paper would open up opportunities for a new, policy-relevant research program on public sector innovation.

AB This paper employs the 2008 financial crisis as an empirical setting to examine how investment strategies of venture capitalists (VCs) vary in the presence of a liquidity supply shock, and what the performance implications of these strategies are for their portfolio startups. We show that while, on aggregate, funded startups receive no less financing during the financial crisis than in non-crisis times, VCs allocate relatively more resources to startups operating in the VCs' core sectors. We show that this skew allocation follows from VCs choosing to double down on their core-sector investing, rather than by a changed mix of investors or startups during the financial crisis. These effects are strongest for early-stage startups, for which information problems are most severe. Furthermore, these results are driven by the investment strategies of more-experienced VCs. Building on these findings, we find superior ex post performance among crisis-funded portfolio startups operating in more experienced VCs' core sectors.

AB We study the role of the relationship among inventors and intermediaries in the licensing of university inventions. We suggest that a prior inventor-intermediaries relationship positively influences licensing rates through selective retention of higher quality relationships and mutual learning in the relationship, enabling intermediaries to reduce both information asymmetry and search costs between inventors and potential licensees. We argue that the influence of a prior inventor-intermediaries relationship on licensing is especially important before intellectual property protection is attained and can be substituted by the buyer-side contacts of inventors and intermediaries. We test these predictions using 919 inventions from the technology transfer office at Stanford University. This study has implications for the policies and design of university technology licensing organizations.

AB The paper focuses on cluster policies with particular attention to the role of R&D collaborative incentives in the structuring of knowledge networks in clusters. We disentangle the main network failures in regional innovation systems, and discuss the selection procedures designed by policy makers to foster knowledge collaborations. We draw evidence from the French Aerospace Valley cluster from 2006 to 2015. The case study is based on a dataset of 248 granted research consortia, from which we build 4-cohort knowledge networks that enable us evidencing the evolving structural properties of the cluster over time. We suggest avoiding the bias and limitations of 1 and 2-mode network analysis by developing an original place-based network methodology that emphasizes on structural equivalence and groups' behaviors. We discuss the results focusing on the convergence degree between the structural properties of the cluster selected by the Program and the policy makers' objectives. Finally, the methodology allows us to identify the agents of the structural and technological changes observed throughout the period.

AB In this paper we address the hub location problem in which capacity restrictions are introduced into the objective function as a penalty cost to represent their congestion effects on respective hubs. The goal of hub location problems is to locate an optimal set of hubs while minimizing sum of the transportation and opening costs under various constraints such as number of hubs, delay time and capacities of hubs. Moreover, we propose a more realistic variant of the problem where the capacities of hubs are not only a limitation in selecting the hubs. In practice, capacities of hubs are predicted by a strategic plan, but these predictions generally fail to meet the expectations due to changes in the flow in future and competitive nature of air transportation. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to handle the complex nature of this problem and shorten the computing times. The performance of the proposed PSO is analyzed comparatively on the Australia Post (AP) data sets. The numerical results show that the proposed method can find the optimal solutions in less computation time in comparison with the earlier multiple allocation hub location models.

ID DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; OPTIMIZATION; FORMULATION
AB Constraint handling technique (CHT) is a critical task for the evolutionary algorithms (EAs) on solving the constrained optimization problems (COPs). In the CHTs development, the definition of the search bias in the search process of an EA is one of the important issues. Based on the different search bias definitions, this study divides the CHTs into two categories: deterministic and non-deterministic techniques. The deterministic techniques define the search bias with an artificial rule. These techniques generally perform well for several scenarios. However, they may have poor performance for some others. This is mainly due to the difficulty to establish an accurate mapping between the complex search scenarios and the uncertain search biases. In contrast with the deterministic techniques, the non-deterministic techniques apply stochastic based methods to escape this mapping establishment which will improve the robustness of the algorithm. However, the probability-based blind random selection can affect negatively on the search efficiency of the algorithm. To compensate the deficiencies of these two categories, this paper proposes a fuzzy search bias guided CHT, namely FSB. The search bias in the FSB is guided by a membership function. It is used to meet the fuzzy knowledge that a solution with large constraint violation biases the search toward solutions with smaller constraint violation and a solution with small constraint violation biases the search toward solutions with better objective function value. The experimental results show that FSB is more robust and more efficient than the other compared techniques. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study proposes a new group decision making (GDM) methodology to solve outranking problems efficiently under uncertainty integrating multi criteria decision making (MCDM) and intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) theory. To this aim, ELECTRE I, an outranking based MCDM approach is extended with VIKOR method, an ideal solution based approach, under intuitionistic fuzzy environment. The methodology utilizes pairwise comparison and outranking relation concepts of ELECTRE methods to construct different concordance and discordance sets in order to reflect preferences of decision makers effectively. By the help of similarities between concordance and discordance characteristics of ELECTRE and maximum group utility and minimum individual regret characteristics of VIKOR, the methodology enables the intuitionistic fuzzy ELECTRE to overcome its weakness in ranking process and presents complete ranking. In addition, this study employs entropy method to identify the weights of criteria and decision makers, and weighted distance approach to determine the weights of different concordance sets. Utilizing these methods leads to specifying these weights objectively. The applicability of the proposed approach is explored by an illustrative example on supplier selection problem by explaining the method step by step. Furthermore, four computational experiments are conducted in order to demonstrate its applicability to the other areas and the results are compared. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The usage of agents has become one of the most effective ways to deal with complex systems. The agent's approach allows for the parallel execution of actions and eases the conception of the system. In this paper, we introduce a language, called Sigon, that allows the definition of agents as multi-context systems. Multi-context systems, in turn, allow for a modular description of the agent, and the implementation of bridge rules contributes to the system flexibility. We propose a generic framework to conceive agents, in which the system's developer defines their internals in terms of contexts and bridge rules. In order to show the way in which the programmer can aggregate other logical contexts, we first present the configurations of a BDI-like agent in our framework. Subsequently, the programmer can add more contexts, such as emotional or negotiating ones, and develop other agent architectures. Thus, our approach can be characterized as a form of generic and extensible architecture. In order to validate our proposal, we introduce some examples that delineate some strengths of the proposal, and also we present an analysis of bridge rules execution to demonstrate the processing overhead.

AB Feature selection is the problem of finding the minimum number of features among a redundant feature space which leads to the maximum classification performance. In this paper, we have proposed a novel feature selection method based on mathematical model of interaction between grasshoppers in finding food sources. Some modifications were applied to the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) to make it suitable for a feature selection problem. The method, abbreviated as GOFS is supplemented by statistical measures during iterations to replace the duplicate features with the most promising features. Several publicly available datasets with various dimensionalities, number of instances, and target classes were considered to evaluate the performance of the GOFS algorithm. The results of implementing twelve well-known and recent feature selection methods were presented and compared with GOFS algorithm. Comparative experiments indicate the significance of the proposed method in comparison with other feature selection methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Weighted graph matching is one of the most fundamental graph theoretical problems used in network design, especially in wireless network services such as radio resource allocation, physical layer security, energy-efficient partner selection and optimizing storage capacity. In this paper we present a distributed heuristic which provides nearly-optimal weighted matchings in polynomial time. We also propose an algorithm to decrease the number of transmitted messages to provide energy-efficient operation. Our approaches assume the asynchronous communication model and small messages having O(log(n)) bits. These assumptions directly fit the battery powered wireless networks such as wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first distributed weighted matching algorithm which benefits from augmentation of augmenting paths having size larger than 3 for these networks. We also provide results of our simulations on synthetic geometric graphs to model wireless networks. Extensive simulations reveal that our algorithm improves the approximation performances of the other weighted matching algorithms and closes the gap between the approximation ratio and the optimum up to 32%.

AB Breast cancer is one of the most common and deadliest cancers that affect mainly women worldwide, and mammography examination is one of the main tools to help early detection. Several papers have been published in the last decades reporting on techniques to automatically recognize breast cancer by analyzing mammograms. These techniques were used to create computer systems to help physicians and radiologists obtain a more precise diagnosis. The objective of this paper is to present an overview regarding the use of machine learning and pattern recognition techniques to discriminate masses in digitized mammograms. The main differences we found in the literature between the present paper and the other reviews are: 1) we used a systematic review method to create this survey; 2) we focused on mass classification problems; 3) the broad scope and spectrum used to investigate this theme, as 129 papers were analyzed to find out whether mass classification in mammograms is a problem solved. In order to achieve this objective, we performed a systematic review process to analyze papers found in the most important digital libraries in the area. We noticed that the three most common techniques used to classify mammographic masses are artificial neural network, support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors. Furthermore, we noticed that mass shape and texture are the most used features in classification, although some papers presented the usage of features provided by specialists, such as BI-RADS descriptors. Moreover, several feature selection techniques were used to reduce the complexity of the classifiers or to increase their accuracies. Additionally, the survey conducted points out some still unexplored research opportunities in this area, for example, we identified that some techniques such as random forest and logistic regression are little explored, while others, such as grammars or syntactic approaches, are not being used to perform this task.

AB In computer vision, one of the ways to identify moving objects or foregrounds from a complex video scene is background subtraction. Two problems that usually arise in background subtraction are that of dynamic background and ghost effect. In this article, an efficient, adaptive, real-time, novel background subtraction method is proposed to handle these two problems by utilizing the classification history of previous frames to detect changes in a video scene. The proposed method, coined as Record Sensitive Background Classifier (RSBC) is an amalgamation of two models, the Adaptive Background Model (ABM) and the Neighbourhood Background Model (NBM), which make use of the foreground and background classification information of the previous frames. The novel design of the ABM considers the temporal history of transitions between foreground and background of a given pixel, while the novelty in NBM lies in considering the binary classification results of the local neighbourhood in the preceding frame. Several state-of-the-art methods are compared with the proposed RSBC method, over which the proposed method shows significant improvement. Because of its good performance at fast processing speeds the proposed method can also be used as a preliminary prioritization step for slower but high accuracy methods in an object tracking system.

AB Production logistics is increasingly receiving attention from supply chain research. This paper focuses on the lack of quantitative approaches to assess the different operating efficiency of production logistics caused by different production modes or structures. Production logistics is first defined as a whole circulation process. Evaluation indexes are established from a perspective of major factors which make up production-logistics systems. Their computational methods are given as well. Based on the fuzzy entropy theory, an operation entropy model of production-logistics systems is developed to measure the operational efficiency of production logistics. In the case study, two operation order parameters under different conditions are calculated using the evaluation indexes and the operation entropy model developed to accurately compare the level of operational efficiency of the workshop before and after implementing cellular manufacturing. Finally, the result demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Prediction interval modelling has been proposed in the literature to characterize uncertain phenomena and provide useful information from a decision-making point of view. In most of the reported studies, assumptions about the data distribution are made and/or the models are trained at one step ahead, which can decrease the quality of the interval in terms of the information about the uncertainty modelled for a higher prediction horizon. In this paper, a new prediction interval modelling methodology based on fuzzy numbers is proposed to solve the abovementioned drawbacks. Fuzzy and neural network prediction interval models are developed based on this proposed methodology by minimizing a novel criterion that includes the coverage probability and normalized average width. The fuzzy number concept is considered because the affine combination of fuzzy numbers generates, by definition, prediction intervals that can handle uncertainty without requiring assumptions about the data distribution. The developed models are compared with a covariance-based prediction interval method, and high-quality intervals are obtained, as determined by the narrower interval width of the proposed method. Additionally, the proposed prediction intervals are tested by forecasting up to two days ahead of the load of the Huatacondo microgrid in the north of Chile and the consumption of the residential dwellings in the town of Loughborough, UK. The results show that the proposed models are suitable alternatives to electrical consumption forecasting because they obtain the minimum interval widths that characterize the uncertainty of this type of stochastic process. Furthermore, the information provided by the obtained prediction interval could be used to develop robust energy management systems that, for example, consider the worst-case scenario.

TI SparseMaps: Convolutional networks with sparse feature maps for tiny

   classification; Learning rate curve; Deep ensembles
AB Deep convolutional models have been able to get extraordinary results in visual, speech and textual processing domains. Nevertheless, the complexity of manifold of images in data space necessitates the deep networks to have a large number of parameters and subsequently these deep models prone to redundancy and overfitting. One of the most effective methods to tackle this problem is devising special regularization methods in the context of convolutional models. In this paper, after presenting and discussing the most important models in the field, sparse feature maps are proposed and employed as a penalty term in the cost function. This conducts the learning process to construct kernels so that the feature maps at every point are sparse along the depth. A sparse representation is able to adapt to the varying level of information of natural images and can help to extract more independent and informative representations. Also, the DropMaps concept is proposed and employed in the last convolutional layer of the model. This technique applies dropout on the feature maps that causes coincidence of feature maps to be avoided. As is shown in this paper, sparse feature maps and DropMaps can handle the problem of overfitting in large models for tiny images. We have studied the effect of the sparsity rate on the accuracy of the model, and it is observed the accuracy of the test dataset reaches its maximum at a sparsity rate of 0.05. Moreover, by designing appropriate learning rate curves, we were able to obtain ensemble machines with much less cost for training. It is noticeable that the test accuracy is higher than the validation accuracy of the ensemble, indicating that the model has not overfitted. In the input of the model, a random online preprocessing layer is employed for the training phase that helps regularization of the model. Comparing input space and feature space of the model we found that the proposed network is able to successfully separate images of different classes. Finally, testing the proposed model with MNIST dataset has shown that the test set can be classified with accuracy 99.75. The same test with CIFAR 10 dataset attained an accuracy of 94.05.

AB This paper presents an application of a recently well performing evolutionary algorithm for continuous numerical optimization, Success-History Based Adaptive Differential Evolution Algorithm (SHADE) including Linear population size reduction (L-SHADE), to an expert system for underwater glider path planning (UGPP). The proposed algorithm is compared to other similar algorithms and also to results from literature. The motivation of this work is to provide an alternative to the current glider mission control systems, that are based mostly on multidisciplinary human-expert teams from robotic and oceanographic areas. Initially configured as a decision-support expert system, the natural evolution of the tool is targeting higher autonomy levels.
   To assess the performance of the applied optimizers, the test functions for UGPP are utilized as defined in literature, which simulate real-life oceanic mission scenarios. Based on these test functions, in this paper, the performance of the proposed application of L-SHADE to UGPP is aggregated using statistical analyis.
   The depicted fitness convergence graphs, final obtained fitness plots, trajectories drawn, and per-scenario analysis show that the new proposed algorithm yields stable and competitive output trajectories. Over the set of benchmark missions, the newly obtained results with a configured L-SHADE outperforms existing literature results in UGPP and ranks best over the compared algorithms. Moreover, some additional previously applied algorithms have been reconfigured to yield improved performance. Thereby, this new application of evolutionary algorithms to UGPP contributes significantly to the capacity of the decisionmakers, when they use the improved UGPP expert system yielding better trajectories.

AB Expert and intelligent systems based on computer-vision algorithms are becoming a common part of our daily lives, as they help us solve problems in areas such as medicine, agriculture, transportation, and ecology. In this paper, we focus on the application of computer vision in marine ecology. Here, we propose a new algorithm for mosaicing images of coral reefs captured by scuba divers using hand-held cameras during reef surveys. Such images often capture partial views of the surveyed area that are then collated into mosaics of the reef assemblages. Accurate mosaics will help coral-reef researchers rapidly assess not only the status of coral reefs, but also determine rates of recovery or rates of decline using longitudinal data. Most standard mosaicing algorithms distort the images, however, and moving objects and parallax errors, which usually happen in underwater images, hinder mosaic construction. To overcome these issues, our new algorithm uses a two-step approach that first detects and then removes loops and low-quality regions from an estimated camera trajectory. The algorithm then stitches the remaining images by warping parallax-affected image regions with a geometric transformation different from the one used for parallax-unaffected regions. We tested our method on images captured during a large spatial survey of coral reef sites throughout the Caribbean region. Our method obtained better-quality mosaics than other state-of-the-art algorithms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The symbiotic organisms search algorithm is a very promising recent metaheuristic algorithm. It has received a plethora of attention from all areas of numerical optimization research, as well as engineering design practices. it has since undergone several modifications, either in the form of hybridization or as some other improved variants of the original algorithm. However, despite all the remarkable achievements and rapidly expanding body of literature regarding the symbiotic organisms search algorithm within its short appearance in the field of swarm intelligence optimization techniques, there has been no collective and comprehensive study on the success of the various implementations of this algorithm. As a way forward, this paper provides an overview of the research conducted on symbiotic organisms search algorithms from inception to the time of writing, in the form of details of various application scenarios with variants and hybrid implementations, and suggestions for future research directions.

AB Real-world optimization problems demand an efficient meta-heuristic algorithm which maintains the diversity of solutions and properly exploits the search space of the problem to find the global optimal solution. Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) is a recently developed population-based meta-heuristic algorithm for solving global optimization problems. SCA uses the characteristics of sine and cosine trigonometric functions to update the solutions. But, like other population-based optimization algorithms, SCA also suffers the problem of low diversity, stagnation in local optima and skipping of true solutions. Therefore, in the present work, an attempt has been made towards the eradication of these issues, by proposing a modified version of SCA. The proposed algorithm is named as modified Sine Cosine Algorithm (m-SCA). In m-SCA, the opposite population is generated using opposite numbers based on perturbation rate to jump out from the local optima. Secondly, in the search equations of SCA self-adaptive component is added to exploit all the promising search regions which are pre-visited. To evaluate the effectiveness in solving the global optimization problems, m-SCA has been tested on two sets of benchmark problems - classical set of 23 well-known benchmark problems and standard IEEE CEC 2014 benchmark test problems. In the paper, the performance of proposed algorithm m-SCA is also tested on five engineering optimization problems. The conducted statistical, convergence and average distance analysis demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm to determine the efficient solution of real-life global optimization problems.

AB This paper introduces a new type of fuzzy sets called interval linguistic hesitant fuzzy sets (ILHFSs), which can address the qualitatively uncertain preferences of decision makers as well as reflect their hesitancy. Such fuzzy sets endow the decision makers with more flexibility: (i) several interval linguistic variables are allowed to represent a judgment, and (ii) the number of interval linguistic variables can be different for different preferences. To show the application of ILHFSs, a group decision-making method with interval linguistic hesitant fuzzy preference relations (ILHFPRs) is introduced. To achieve this goal, an additive consistency concept for ILHFPRs is presented to derive the rational rankings. Following this concept, a programming model for judging the additive consistency of ILHFPRs is constructed. Then, an additive consistency-based programming model is established to ascertain missing values in incomplete ILHFPRs. Subsequently, an approach for calculating the interval linguistic hesitant fuzzy priority weight vector from incomplete and inconsistent ILHFPRs is presented. To measure the agreement degree of the decision makers' judgements, a consensus index is offered, and a method for determining the weights of the decision makers is proposed. Finally, a numerical example about evaluating commodity sales platforms in China is chosen to illustrate the utilization of the new method. The results extend and perfect the application scope of preference relations, which offer the decision makers more choices to express their judgments. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Optimum design problems, including structural optimization problems, often include multiple objectives. A multiobjective optimization problem usually provides a number of optimal solutions, called non-dominated solutions or Pareto-optimal solutions. In multiobjective topology optimization scenarios, decision makers face the challenging task of choosing the most effective solution that meets their needs; serial comparisons among a set of Pareto-optimal solution are cumbersome, as are trial-and-error attempts to find an appropriate solution among a host of alternatives. On the other hand, the recent integration of data mining techniques in multiobjective optimization methods can provide decision makers with important, highly pertinent, and useful knowledge.
   In this paper, we propose a data mining technique for knowledge discovery in multiobjective topology optimization. The proposed method sequentially applies clustering and association rule analysis to a Pareto-optimal solution set. First, clustering is applied in the design space and the result is then visualized in the objective space. After clustering, detailed features in each cluster are analyzed based on the concept of association rule analysis, so that characteristic substructures can be extracted from each cluster of solutions. In four numerical examples, we demonstrate that the proposed method provides pertinent knowledge that aids comprehension of the key substructures responsible for one or more desired performances, thereby giving decision makers a useful tool for discovery of particularly effective design solutions.

AB Technological and market cycles pressure organizations to introduce new products. To make room for the new products, product deletion (PD) decisions are inevitable. PD implementation, however, is beyond the reactive elimination of mature or low-profit products. As a competitive and proactive managerial tool, PD requires incorporation of supply chain financial and non-financial attributes to not only benefit organizations, but also maintain important partnerships. To successfully apply strategic PD, consideration of a broader set of decision factors is necessary. To update the traditional view, this paper introduces supply chain and competitive factors to product deletion decision-making (PDDM). Given the complex multi-criteria problem, including both qualitative and quantitative factors and the relative uncertainties and interaction between the factors, a Nested-Fuzzy Inference System with Interactions (NFISI) model as part of a multi-stage, multi-method expert system is introduced to aid the decision-making process. The model is verified using a practical case in a major fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company. The priority of alternative products for deletion is obtained through the application of the developed model considering the newly introduced factors. The results provide initial, albeit idiosyncratic, insights with a discussion of practical implications. It is demonstrated that considering supply chain factors makes a difference in PDDM outcomes. A brief overview of research opportunities is finally presented to guide researchers in contributing to this under-studied subject. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

AB Querying databases to search for "best" objects matching users' preferences is a fundamental problem of intelligent systems and applications. The skyline query is an important tool for solving such a best-matching problem from the concept of multi-criteria optimization. However, it has the size problem as the size of the results of a skyline query grows superlinearly with the number of criteria. Here, we propose to find both the informative and concise set of skyline, a refined skyline set without similar objects. The informativeness requires the reduced set to cover the skyline, i.e., for every skyline point in the original dataset, there exists a close point in the reduced set, which help users to understand the skyline in more detail and make a better decision. The conciseness requires the size of the reduced set that can cover the skyline is as smaller as possible, which help users to make a quick decision. Finding both the informative and concise set of skyline will boost the usability of intelligent systems. More specifically, we propose two new skyline queries to find the informative and concise set of skyline: minimum skyline query, and extended minimum skyline query. The main idea is to return the minimum number of approximation objects, in which there is an object within a predefined distance threshold for each skyline object. The difference of the two query types is that the former one selects approximation objects only from skyline set, while the latter one selects from the whole dataset. We present an exact solution which computes minimum skyline in linear time for a 2d-space. As both minimum skyline and extended minimum skyline problems are NP-hard for dimensionality at least three, we present greedy solutions that obtain a 1 + ln R approximation of the optimums. A comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates that the size of skyline set can be effectively reduced by using the proposed (extended) minimum skyline queries and our proposed algorithms have promising results.

AB Personalized recommendation systems have solved the information overload problem caused by large volumes of Web data effectively. However, most existing recommendation algorithms are weak in handling the problem of rating data sparsity that characterizes most recommender systems and results in deteriorated recommendation accuracy. The results in the KDDCUP and Netflix competition have proven that the matrix factorization algorithm achieves better performance than other recommendation algorithms when the rating data is scarce. However, the highly sparse rating matrix will cause the overfitting problem in matrix factorization. Although regularization can relieve the issue of overfitting to some extent, it is still a significant challenge to train an effective model for recommender systems when the data is highly sparse. Therefore, this paper proposes a co-SVD model to enrich the single data source and mitigate the overfitting problem in matrix factorization. The user preferences are enriched not only by rating data but also the tag data; subsequently, the relevance between tags and item features are explored. Furthermore, according to the assumption that user preferences will change with time, we optimize the preference and relevance by adding the temporal influence. Based on the MovieLens benchmark datasets, the experimental results indicate that the proposed co-SVD method is more effective than other baselines. Matrix co-factorization provides an effective method to the solve data sparsity problem with additional information. The method can be used to address this problem in various expert and intelligent systems such as recommendation advertisements, e-commerce sites, and social media platforms, all of which require a relatively large amount of input data from users.

AB On feature selection, as one of the critical steps to develop a distress prediction model (DPM), a variety of expert systems and machine learning approaches have analytically supported developers. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) has provided this support by estimating the novel feature of managerial efficiency, which has frequently been used in recent two-stage DPMs. As key contributions, this study extends the application of expert system in credit scoring and distress prediction through applying diverse DEA models to compute corporate market efficiency in addition to the prevailing managerial efficiency, and to estimate the decomposed measure of mix efficiency and investigate its contribution compared to Pure Technical Efficiency and Scale Efficiency in the performance of DPMs. Further, this paper provides a comprehensive comparison between two-stage DPMs through estimating a variety of DEA efficiency measures in the first stage and employing static and dynamic classifiers in the second stage. Based on experimental results, guidelines are provided to help practitioners develop two-stage DPMs; to be more specific, guidelines are provided to assist with the choice of the proper DEA models to use in the first stage, and the choice of the best corporate efficiency measures and classifiers to use in the second stage.

AB Road extraction from very high resolution remotely sensed images is crucial in many urban applications. Acquiring automatically up-to-date and accurate information about roads is significant for various intelligent applications such as smart vehicle navigation, planning urban areas, roads monitoring and traffic management for intelligent transportation systems, and leading proper military operations. All possible knowledge about roads properties must be incorporated in designing intelligent systems that interpret and decide with high precision the existence of roads in remote sensing images. Various extraction techniques rely on mathematical morphology (MM) that detects desired road structures through a sliding standard and empirically chosen structuring element (SE) over the input image. In this paper, we design an intelligent process that not only combines spectral and spatial properties of roads but also impacts significantly the flexibility in retrieving spatial information. Indeed, we propose an adaptive algorithm that supplies tailored and most adequate arbitrary structuring elements for every image at hand. It has the significant impact of providing flexibility since every arbitrary generated SE is exclusively dedicated to the processed image. The processing consists of two major steps: a) we use the particle swarm optimization algorithm to look for the adaptive SEs; b) we introduce a priori knowledge based on human visual interpretation of roads characteristics and define some spatial indices to refine the results. We evaluated our method over many remotely sensed images; accuracy results show that the proposed method outperforms standard approaches which are limited to utilize only empirically chosen and standard SEs.

AB Data heterogeneity is one of the big challenges in modern data analysis caused by the effects of unknown/unwanted factors introduced during data collection procedures. It will cause spurious estimation of variable effects when traditional methods are applied for feature selection which simply assume that data samples are independently and identically distributed. Although some existing statistical models can evaluate more accurately the significance of each variable by estimating and including unknown factors as covariates, they are categorized as filter methods suffering from variable redundancy and lack of predictability. Therefore, we propose an embedded feature selection method from a sparse learning perspective capable of adjusting unknown heterogeneity. Its performance is investigated by evaluating the classification performance using the selected features in multi-class classification problems. Benefitting from the effective adjustment of unknown heterogeneity and model selection strategy, the experimental results on synthetic data and three real-world benchmark data sets have shown that our method can achieve consistent superiority over several conventional embedded methods and existing statistical models.

AB The yield curve is the centrepiece in bond markets, a massive asset class with an overall size of USD 100 trillion that remains relatively under-investigated using machine learning. This paper is the first comprehensive study using artificial neural networks in the context of yield curve forecasting. Specifically, two models were used for forecasting the European yield curve: multivariate linear regression and multilayer perceptron (MLP), at five forecasting horizons, from next day to 20 days ahead. Five variants of the MLP were analysed with different sets of features: target to predict (univariate); the most relevant features: all generated features; and the former two incorporating synthetic data generated by the linear regression model. Additionally, two different techniques of multitask learning were employed: simultaneous modelling and transformation into multiple single task learning. The results show that considering all forecasting horizons, the MLP using the most relevant features achieved the best results and the addition of synthetic data tends to improve accuracy. Furthermore, different targets and forecasting horizons resulted in different relevant features, reinforcing the importance of custom-built models. In the two multitask learning methodologies no clear differentiation could be demonstrated, and several explaining factors are identified. Overall, the outcome is very encouraging for the development of better forecasting systems for fixed income markets. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Unforced idle time is considered in order to reduce the earliness of jobs. It is shown how unforced idle time can be inserted on the final machine. Several dispatching heuristics that have been used for the problem without unforced idle time were modified and tested. Several procedures were also developed that conduct a second pass to develop a sequence using dispatching rules. These procedures were also tested and were found to result in better solutions.

AB Medical imaging systems often require the application of image enhancement techniques to help physicians in anomaly/abnormality detection and diagnosis, as well as to improve the quality of images that undergo automated image processing. In this work we introduce MedGA, a novel image enhancement method based on Genetic Algorithms that is able to improve the appearance and the visual quality of images characterized by a bimodal gray level intensity histogram, by strengthening their two underlying sub-distributions. MedGA can be exploited as a pre-processing step for the enhancement of images with a nearly bimodal histogram distribution, to improve the results achieved by downstream image processing techniques. As a case study, we use MedGA as a clinical expert system for contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance image analysis, considering Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery for uterine fibroids. The performances of MedGA are quantitatively evaluated by means of various image enhancement metrics, and compared against the conventional state-of-the-art image enhancement techniques, namely, histogram equalization, bi-histogram equalization, encoding and decoding Gamma transformations, and sigmoid transformations. We show that MedGA considerably outperforms the other approaches in terms of signal and perceived image quality, while preserving the input mean brightness. MedGA may have a significant impact in real healthcare environments, representing an intelligent solution for Clinical Decision Support Systems in radiology practice for image enhancement, to visually assist physicians during their interactive decision-making tasks, as well as for the improvement of downstream automated processing pipelines in clinically useful measurements.

AB This paper develops a graph-theoretic approach to analyzing information system priorities using expert knowledge. The constructed information system model lends itself to the identification and quantification of priority pathways of information flow in the system where agents have different learning and information distribution capacities. The approach is developed in four steps. In step 1, a policy issue is formulated using systems approach. In step 2, through a workshop, expert knowledge is gathered on the interactions of system components. Distribution and learning capacities of individual components are approximated through a questionnaire. In step 3, with the aid of graph-theoretic concepts, system priorities are quantitatively refined. In step 4, using the findings from graph-theoretic analysis, specific policy interventions are developed for effective targeting of the policy issue. The approach developed is then illustrated with an application to food and nutrition security information system in Azerbaijan. Specific policy intervention strategies are proposed.

AB This paper proposes a new methodology to automatically segment and measure the volume of pulmonary nodules in lung computed tomography (CT) scans. Estimating the malignancy likelihood of a pulmonary nodule based on lesion characteristics motivated the development of an unsupervised pulmonary nodule segmentation and volume measurement as a preliminary stage for pulmonary nodule characterization. The idea is to optimally cluster a set of feature vectors composed by intensity and shape-related features in a given feature data space extracted from a pre-detected nodule. For that purpose, a metaheuristic search based on evolutionary computation is used for clustering the corresponding feature vectors. The proposed method is simple, unsupervised and is able to segment different types of nodules in terms of location and texture without the need for any manual annotation. We validate the proposed segmentation and volume measurement on the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative - LIDC-IDRI dataset. The first dataset is a group of 705 solid and sub-solid (assessed as part-solid and non-solid) nodules located in different regions of the lungs, and the second, more challenging, is a group of 59 sub-solid nodules. The average Dice scores of 82.35% and 71.05% for the two datasets show the good performance of the segmentation proposal. Comparisons with previous state-of-the-art techniques also show acceptable and comparable segmentation results. The volumes of the segmented nodules are measured via ellipsoid approximation. The correlation and statistical significance between the measured volumes of the segmented nodules and the ground-truth are obtained by Pearson correlation coefficient value, obtaining an R-value >= 92.16% with a significance level of 5%.

AB Kernel based locality-sensitive sparse representation is currently an active hot research topic in artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, signal processing and multimedia applications. In this paper, a new kernel based approach; named Video Semantic Analysis based Kernel Locality-Sensitive Discriminative Sparse Representation (KLSDSR) is proposed. This is to improve video semantic analysis for military intelligence systems and video surveillance. The proposed algorithm is able to learn more discriminative sparse representation (SR) coefficients based on group sparsity for video semantic analysis by incorporating both sparsity and locality-sensitive in kernel feature space with mapping of the SR features into a high dimensional space. Furthermore, an optimal dictionary is however engendered to compute the SR of video features aimed at good preservation of the locality structure among video semantic features and an improvement on computational cost. The proposed method gave promising classification results, when compared with state-of-the-art comparative approaches based on experimental results on video semantic concepts, which significantly improves the discrimination of SR features and it outperformed the other baseline methods.

AB In recent years, the proliferation of online resumes and the need to evaluate large populations of candidates for on-site and virtual teams have led to a growing interest in automated team-formation. Given a large pool of candidates, the general problem requires the selection of a team of experts to complete a given task. Surprisingly, while ongoing research has studied numerous variations with different constraints, it has overlooked a factor with a well-documented impact on team cohesion and performance: team faultlines. Addressing this gap is challenging, as the available measures for faultlines in existing teams cannot be efficiently applied to faultline optimization. In this work, we meet this challenge with a new measure that can be efficiently used for both faultline measurement and minimization. We then use the measure to solve the problem of automatically partitioning a large population into low-faultline teams. By introducing faultlines to the team-formation literature, our work creates exciting opportunities for algorithmic work on faultline optimization, as well as on work that combines and studies the connection of faultlines with other influential team characteristics.

AB Marketing analytics is a diverse field, with both academic researchers and practitioners coming from a range of backgrounds including marketing, expert systems, statistics, and operations research. This paper provides an integrative review at the boundary of these areas. The aim is to give researchers in the intelligent and expert systems community the opportunity to gain a broad view of the marketing analytics area and provide a starting point for future interdisciplinary collaboration. The topics of visualization, segmentation, and class prediction are featured. Links between the disciplines are emphasized. For each of these topics, a historical overview is given, starting with initial work in the 1960s and carrying through to the present day. Recent innovations for modern, large, and complex "big data" sets are described. Practical implementation advice is given, along with a directory of open source R routines for implementing marketing analytics techniques. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Influence maximization is an important issue in social network analysis domain which concerns finding the most influential nodes. Determining the influential nodes is made with respect to information diffusion models. Most of the existing models only contain trust relationships while distrust exist in social networks as well. There exist some drawbacks in limited studies where distrust relationship is involved. The most outstanding drawback is the lack of assessment on the validity of the schemes presented on how influence propagates through distrust relationships in comparison with real word propagation in social networks. In this paper, two schemes are proposed, where based on each, some new models are proposed in two classes: cascade-based and threshold-based. All models of concern here are evaluated in comparison with the benchmark models through two real data sets, the Epinions and Bitcoin OTC. Results obtained indicate the superiority of one of the proposed schemes: when a distrusted user performs an action or adopts an opinion, the target users may tend not to do it.

AB Rhododendron arboreum inhabits the Himalayan climate otherwise detrimental to many species, though the underlying survival mechanism remains unclear. Such temperate species have an inherent endurance towards freezing temperature which is prerequisite for an initiation and transition to flowering phase. Orchestrating the molecular architecture is vital towards managing distinct abiotic signals. To determine the molecular factors directing growth, development, and tolerance under environmental extremes in the species, the high-throughput transcriptome and metabolome data from vegetative as well as cold-acclimatized flowering season tissues were generated. Firstly, the de novo assembly pertaining to the foliar and floral tissues comprising of 157,427 unigenes was examined for a comparative analysis. 4149 of 12,577 transcripts observed with a significant fluctuating expression corresponded to seasonal retorts. Following the interactive network, 525 genes were distinguished as the epicenters of sense, response, and tolerance. Secondly, liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was adopted to profile the extent of metabolite richness across the tissues of two seasons. Taking into account the formula-based mappings offered by MetaboSearch tool, 421 unique ions obtained were annotated to 173 KEGG compounds, especially secondary metabolites. Moreover, by integrating the transcript and metabolite annotations, it was found that right from active metabolism, signaling, development, and their regulations, supplementary response to abiotic/biotic stimuli was induced. A multifaceted response displayed during flowering not only sponsored the climatic encounters but brought the shift from vegetative to reproductive growth. Overall, this comprehensive approach following transcriptome and non-targeted metabolome elucidated the contribution of genetic and metabolic factors in environmental responses.

AB The ubiquitous phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase enzymes in plants play pivotal role during carbon metabolism in photosynthesis, physicochemical processes, and tolerance to various abiotic or chemical stresses. We are presenting a bioinformatics identification of PEPC gene family in tomato and its phylogenetic classification into PTPC and BTPC sub families. Tomato PEPC genes are distributed in four different chromosomes with a unique motif and gene structure that strengthen their classification into two sub families. Identification of twelve different cis-regulatory elements related to abiotic and exogenous phytohormones showed their diverse role. Moreover, RNA-seq and qRT-PCR based tissues specific analysis revealed their role in its growth and development. In tomato, PEPC genes exhibited a diverse temporal expression under salt, cold and exogenous phytohormones. For an instance, S1PEPC1, SIPEPC4, and S1PEPC5 was upregulated under salt, drought, ABA, and JA in shoots. While, SIPEPC3, S1PEPC4, and SIPEPCS was induced in root tissues upon exposure to drought, cold, and GA. Similarly, the enzyme activity of tomato PEPC was significantly upregulated under all these stresses but peaked under salt and IAA in roots and under GA in leaves. All tomato PEPC predicted in cytoplasm and the transient expression assay validate it. Our study insight into unique features of PEPC gene family in tomato and may sever as foundation for functional their studies.

AB Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) widely distributed in invertebrates and vertebrates are pattern recognition molecules in innate immunity. In the present study, a novel short PGRP gene, designated as ApPGRP was identified from Anatolica polka. The deduced amino acid sequence of ApPGRP is composed of 196 residues and contains a conserved PGRP domain at the C-terminus. The phylogenetic tree showed that ApPGRP shared high homology of amino acid sequence with TcPGRP2 from Tribolium castaneum. The recombinant protein of ApPGRP exhibited binding activity toward Escherichia coli and DAP-type PGN from E. coli. Quantitative real time PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis indicated that the relative expression level of ApPGRP was up-regulated significantly after E. coli and DAP-type PGN challenge in the fifth instar larvae of A. polita. Moreover, the expressions of three antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) (ApAttacin 1, ApAttacin 2 and ApColeoptericin) were significantly increased after E. coli and DAP-type PGN challenge. RNA interference (RNAi) experiments showed that the expressions of three AMPs in the larvae of A. polita were significantly decreased after injection of ApPGRP dsRNA. Furthermore, the expressions of three AMPs in the larvae injected were still significantly decreased after E. coli challenge compared to the control samples without dsRNA injection. The predicted 3D structure showed that the ApPGRP could form the protein core of five beta-sheet and three alpha-helices, which would be involved in specific PGN recognition. These results suggested that ApPGRP may play an important role in the immune response to E. coli infection and function as a receptor for antimicrobial peptide gene induction in Anatolica polita.

AB Aim To explore the feasibility of using mesothelin (MESO) as a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and its function in the development of cervical cancer.
   Methods: We collected eight cervical tissue samples of squamous cell carcinoma as the test group and eight samples of cervicitis as the control group from patients who underwent a hysterectomy because of a diagnosis of myoma. Then we used western blotting to screen for a potential TAA in cervical squamous cell carcinoma samples. In addition, Lentivirus-mediated RNAi was used to downregulate the expression of the MESO gene (MSLN) in SiHa cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo (-z-y1)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide (MTT), and wound healing were used to examine cell apoptosis, cell proliferation, and cell migration respectively.
   Results: Results of the western blotting showed that the MESO protein expressed highly in the cervical squamous cell carcinoma and paracancerous tissues in contrast to the cervicitis tissue (p = 0.242). We used quantitative PCR to verify that the expression of MSLN was 21.6% in the cells undergoing knockdown compared to that in the control cells, and thus, decided to continue with further experiments. We confirmed by FACS that the apoptosis rate in the SiHa cell group undergoing MSLN knockdown (KD group) was significantly higher than that in negative control (NC) group of SiHa cells (p = 0.014). The proliferation of cells was examined by MTT and the difference between the KD and NC groups was found to be statistically significant (p = 0.002). However, since the difference was < 20% we did not consider it to be clinically significant. Cell migration ability was verified by wound healing test and found to be 43% in the KD group and 38% in the NC group after 48 h, but the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).
   Conclusions: MESO might be used as a TAA for diagnosing cervical squamous cell carcinoma. When MSLN was knocked down in SiHa cells, cell apoptosis increased, but no significant effects were observed on cell proliferation and migration. Thus, our study shows that MSLN plays a role in the apoptosis of cervical squamous cell carcinoma cells, and since this might affect tumor progression, further research is warranted to understand how MSLN plays this role.

AB The genetic regulation of lipolytic enzyme is closely related to carcass quality traits through deposition of intramuscular fat (marbling) in beef cattle breeds. The alpha/beta hydrolase domain containing 5 (ABHD5) is an accelerating factor of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), which plays a key role in triglyceride metabolism. In this study, we determined that bovine ABHD5 gene was highly expressed in adult bovine adipose tissue. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in bovine ABHD5 regulation, we cloned and characterized the promoter region of ABHD5. Applying 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA end analysis (RACE), we identified transcriptional start site (TSS) found in the predicted CpG island within promoter region of ABHD5 gene. Using the recombinant dual fluorescent reporter vectors, the fragment of -109/ + 307 was identified as proximal minimum core promoter region of ABHD5 in bovine intramuscular adipocytes. Site directed mutagenesis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) confirmed the role of two transcription factors, namely Ectopic viral integration site 1 (Evil) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha), in the regulation of ABHD5 gene. Taken together these findings we can conclude that ABHD5 gene regulated by Evil and C/EBP alpha could be used as potential marker in marker assisted selection for the improvement of Qinchuan cattle breed for carcass quality traits.

AB Wnt signaling pathway plays a major role in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Small molecules which can cut off this signal transduction can be promising anti-cancer drugs for CRC therapy. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms of FH535, an inhibitor of the Wnt signaling pathway, on inhibiting proliferation and migration of colorectal cancer cells DLD-1 and SW620. We found that FH535 could significantly suppress the growth of DLD-1 and SW620 cells in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. The results of cell cycle tests showed that FH535 could significantly induce G2/M arrest in colorectal cancer cells. Transwell and Wound-healing assays revealed that FH535 notably inhibited cell migration. Moreover, we found that FH535 down-regulated beta-catenin and CyclinA2 expressions while up-regulating Claudin-1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, which may contribute to the FH535-induced inhibitory effect on proliferation and migration in human colorectal cancer cells. Our study revealed that FH535 inhibited proliferation and migration of colorectal cancer cells by regulating CyclinA2 and Claudinl gene expression, which enriches regulatory network of FH535 and may contribute to being promising anti-cancer drugs for CRC therapy.

AB Throughout the plant life cycle, growth of new leaves is governed by cell division and cell expansion. During steady-state growth of the maize leaf, these processes are spatially separated between the meristem zone, consisting of dividing cells at the leaf base, the elongation zone, consisting of expanding cells moving upwards from the meristem, and the mature zone containing differentiated mature cells. Increased leaf size can be achieved through increasing cell number or cell size, for example by manipulating the genes controlling the transition between those zones. In this study, microRNA (miRNA) genes, which are a class of endogenous small, non-coding gene regulatory RNAs, were investigated in the growth zones, to gain insight into their role in the transition between cell division and cell expansion. A genome-wide survey was conducted using a miRNA-microarray and 59 miRNA genes were detected to be differentially expressed between the growth zones. miR160, miR166, miR168, miR172, miR319 and miR390 families were significantly up-regulated in the meristem relative to the elongation and mature zones. In contrast, expression of the miR167 and miR396 families was lower in the meristem and higher in the mature zone. Therefore, these were considered to be candidate growth-regulated miRNAs that control cell division processes indirectly by repressing target genes. The miR156, miR166, miR167, miR399, miR408 and miR2275 families were expressed most highly in the elongation zone, and so were classified as elongation-specific, with possible roles in switching from cell division to cell elongation during leaf differentiation. In silico target prediction analysis showed that these miRNAs target several transcription factors and metabolic genes, and a reciprocal relationship between the expression levels of miR319 and miR396 and their targets was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, 12 candidate novel miRNAs were identified from the microarray data and computationally verified. Three out of twelve were also validated by qRT-PCR. These findings provide important information regarding the regulatory functions of miRNAs in controlling progression of growth mechanisms.

AB Bichirs are a sister group to sarcopterygian and tetrapods that can fully regenerate their endochondral-skeleton-fins. Histological and transcriptomic comparison approaches have been used to investigate the morphology and genetic basis of bichir lobe-fin regeneration, with strong down-regulation of muscle-related genes and up-regulation of ECM-related genes and developmental genes being observed. Bichir limb regeneration involves similar cellular processes to those employed by lungfish and salamander, with MARCKS-like protein (MLP) that is known to be a putative regeneration-initiating molecule in salamander, also up-regulated in the early stages of bichir lobe-fin regeneration. These gene expression results suggest that limb regeneration pathways in these amphibians have a common ancestral inheritance, consistent with evolution from endochondral-skeleton-fin structures to endochondral-skeleton-limb structures of vertebrates.

AB Aims: Acute myocardial infarction is one of the most threaten disease in the world. In previous studies, exosome derived miR-126 has been verified that exert an pro-angiogenic function through exosomal transfer. However, the function of miR-126 in ischemic reperfusion injury remains unknown. The aim of the study was to investigate the function and mechanism of miR-126 in ischemic reperfusion injury.
   Methods: H2O2 and CoCl2-treated neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to analyze the function of miR-126 in vitro. Tunel, JC-1, ROS, LDH and cell survival rates were detected to evaluate the function of miR-126. Rat acute myocardial infarction was performed to elucidate the function of miR-126 in vivo.
   Results: We found that miR-126 could reduce the apoptosis and improved cell survival of H2O2-treated and CoCl2-treated neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. MiR-126 also attenuates the ROS elevation and mitochondrial membrane potential through JC-1 detection. miR-126 also improved the cardiac function in vivo. Luciferase activity revealed that miR-126 could bind to ERRFI1, suggesting miR-126 functioned through regulating ERRFI1.
   Conclusion: We verified the function and mechanism of miR-126 and provide evidence that miR-126 may play important role in ischemic reperfusion injury, and understanding the precise role of miR-126 will undoubtedly shed new light on the clinical treatment.

AB This study aims to investigate whether circ-HIPK3 could promote the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells by upregulating STAT3 after binding to miR-124-3p, thus participating in the development of glioma. Expression levels of circ-HIPK3, miR-124-3p and STAT3 in glioma cell lines were determined using qRT-PCR. The regulatory effects of circ-HIPK3, miR-124-3p and STAT3 on proliferative and invasive capacities of glioma cells were accessed using EdU assay, CCK-8 assay and invasion assay, respectively. Cell cycle assay and cell apoptosis assay were performed by flow cytometry. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was conducted to determine the binding condition among circ-HIPK3, miR-124-3p and STAT3. Rescue experiments were performed in co-transfected glioma cells. QRT-PCR data showed that circ-HIPK3 and STAT3 are highly expressed, whereas miR-124-3p is lowly expressed in glioma cells than those of negative control cell. Knockdown of circ-HIPK3 in U87 and U251 cells inhibited their proliferative and invasive capacities. On the contrary, miR-124-3p knockdown improved proliferative and migratory capacities. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay exerted that circ-HIPK3 could bind to miR-124-3p and STAT3 is the target gene of miR-124-3p. Western blot results elucidated that circ-HIPK3 stabilizes STAT3 expression, whereas miR-124-3p degrades STAT3 expression. Rescue experiments demonstrated that overexpression of circ-HIPK3 could partially reverse the inhibited proliferative and migratory capacities induced by miR-124-3p in U87 and U251 cells. In summary, we found that overexpression of circ-HIPK3 promotes proliferative and invasive capacities of glioma cells by sponging miR-124-3p to upregulate STAT3 expression.

AB The BABY BOOM2 gene, designated LIcBBM2, and its promoter were isolated from hybrid larch (Larix kaempferi x L. olgensis). The open reading frame of LkBBM2 was 2574 bp, encoding 857 amino acids. The LkBBM2 protein contains two AP2 DNA binding domains and a BBM specific motif, but lacks the euANT5 motif common to AP2 family members. The LkBBM2 promoter contains several hormone response and root-specific expression elements. LkBBM2 expression was significantly higher in larch adventitious roots (ARs) than in stems, leaves or stem tips, and increased after auxin treatment. The fused protein LkBBM2-GFP was localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm whereas LkBBM1-GFP was only localized in the nucleus. Over-expression of LkBBM2 and LkBBM1 in Arabidopsis significantly elongated the roots. Furthermore, over-expression those two genes in the hybrid poplar (Populus alba x P. glandulosa) significantly increased ARs number. We speculated that these two genes regulate AR development.

AB Genetic variations among HR-HPV types lead to altered biological functions with possible clinical significance in different geographical locations. To explore intratype genetic variations of HPV51 E6, E7, L1 and L2 genes originating from Southwest China, a total of 5204 cervical scraped cell samples were collected for DNA extraction and HPV typing. And then the E6, E7, L1 and L2 genes of HPV51 (n = 79) were sequenced and compared to the reference sequence (M62877). The ConSurf server was used for identification of conserved structural and functional amino acids of the E6 and E7 oncogenes, and the changes of the secondary structure were analyzed by PSIPred software. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the maximum likelihood method implemented in IQ-TREE. The selection pressure acting on the E6, E7, L1 and L2 genes was estimated by Datamonkey web server. 13 nucleotide polymorphism sites were observed in E6-E7 gene and the most common mutation sites were C395T (S100L), C756T (S66L), C796T, A832G. 36 nucleotide polymorphism sites were identified in full length L1 gene and the non-synonymous mutations T6311G, A6312T (V264G), G6313A (G2655) A5674C (I52L), A6335C (N272T), A6586C (T354P) and synonymous mutations A5649T, C6147T, A6435G, G6570A, A6651G, T6774C, A6784C, A6882G, C6918A, and G6984A were the most common mutations. 53 nucleotide variation sites were identified in full-length L2 gene including four insertion sites (4418A, 4670G, 4693A, 4694C) and one deletion site (A4430). Besides, the non -synonymous mutations G4227A (V321), A4407G (I92V), G4945A (D271N), C4985A (T284K), T5260G (L376V), A5335C (T401P) and the synonymous mutations A4166G, G4229A, G4283A, T4453C, C4566A, T4596C, C4695T, C4830T, G4839A, A5160C, and T5286G were the most common mutations. Specially, a triallelic mutation site (G4461C/A) in L2 was identified, with 26% G4461C (E109D) being non -synonymous mutation. Selective pressure analysis showed that only codon site 66 in E7 and 52 in L1 were the positively selected sites and codon sites 72, 107, 342, 412, 427 were negatively selected sites in L2 gene. Our investigation also suggests that A2 and A4 were the most frequent HPV51 lineage in Southwest China.

AB MicroRNA is an important regulation factor in insect development and metamorphosis. It has been reported that E(spl)m4 is a miRNA-targeted gene, as well as the target of the Notch signaling pathway in Drosophila. The expression of E(spl)m4 can be regulated by microRNA and further affect the neural development of Drosophila. Here, we found that BmEm4, an ortholog of E(spl)m4 from Bombyx mori, was the target gene of bmo-miR-79, with target sites containing the Brd and K boxes of the BmEm4_3'UTR, which was validated by the dual luciferase reporter (DLR) assay. Furthermore, bmo-miR-79 mimics can inhibit the expression of BmEm4 in BmN cells after transfection, and bmo-miR-79 can also inhibit the expression of BmEm4 in different developmental stages of Bombyx mori at a posttranscriptional level, to different degrees. The EMSA test further showed that bmo-miR-79 could bind to BmAGO2, which is the Bombyx mori argonaute2 protein, suggesting that bmo-miR-79 might regulate the expression of BmEm4 by forming miRISC complexes with BmAGO2. Taken together, bmo-miR-79 could regulate the expression of BmEm4 mediated by BmAGO2 and further affect its function in the silkworm Bombyx mori.

AB Accumulating evidences have demonstrated the importance of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in initiation and progression of various cancers, including prostate cancer. LncRNA SAP30L-AS1 is previously identified in the plasma of prostate cancer patients. In this study, we further investigated the expression of SAP30L-AS1 in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. Moreover, we explored the biological roles and mechanisms of action of SAP30L-AS1 in prostate cancer. The expression of SAP30L-AS1 is found to be increased in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues and normal prostate epithelial cell line, respectively. Increased expression of SAP30L-AS1 is associated with greater Gleason score, advanced pathological T stage, and poor over survival of prostate cancer patients. Functional assays demonstrated that ectopic expression of SAP30L-AS1 promotes prostate cancer proliferation and inhibits prostate cancer apoptosis. SAP30L-AS1 knockdown represses prostate cancer proliferation and induces prostate cancer apoptosis. Furthermore, SAP30L-AS1 knockdown represses prostate cancer xenograft growth in vivo. Mechanistic investigation revealed that SAP30L-AS1 physically binds to the promoter of SAP30L and represses SAP30L expression. The expression of SAP30L is negatively associated with that of SAP30L-AS1 in prostate cancer tissues. Rescue assays demonstrated that overexpression of SAP30L attenuated the roles of SAP30L-AS1 in promoting prostate cancer proliferation and inhibiting prostate cancer apoptosis. In conclusion, SAP30L-AS1 is upregulated and has oncogenic roles in prostate cancer via repressing SAP30L. Our data suggest that SAP30L-AS1 may be a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for prostate cancer.

AB As an innovative CXC chemokine, CXCL17 has a mysterious clinical significance and modulating influence on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our study examined the activity and mechanisms of CXCL17 on growth, autophagy, and metastasis of HCC. Upregulation of CXCL17 expression was observed in HCC, which is correlated with poorer histological stages and outcomes. Elevation of CXCL17 expression promoted proliferation, invasion, and migration and decreased LC-3B biosynthesis and p62 protein reduction, which are known to stimulate autophagy. However, silencing of CXCL17 inhibited the development of these cancerous phenotypes. Furthermore, AMPK was stimulated after knockdown of CXCL17. This stimulation, as well as stimulation of autophagy was caused by liver kinase B1 (LKB1), whose function is induced by knockdown CXCL17. Additionally, knockdown of CXCL17 enhanced nuclear translocation of LKB1. Altogether, these findings suggest that elevated CXCL17 expression in HCC promotes malignant reactions in malignant cells. Our research offers new evidence that chemokine CXCL17 reinforces malignant invasion and suppresses autophagy via the LKB1-AMPK pathway.

AB We describe a novel method for enzymatic production of slowly digestible starch (SDS) at 100 degrees C. A hyperthermophilicamylopullulanase from archaeon Staphylothermus marinus (SMApu) was expressed in a generally recognised as safe (GRAS) microorganism, Bacillus subtilis. Purified SMApu at 80-240 U/g substrate was incubated with 0.1 g/mL of corn starch in a boiling water bath for 2 h. SDS content of the SMApu-modified starch increased significantly from 17.4 to 42.7% (P < 0.05). Molecular weight and amylopectin branch chains A (DP 6-12) of SMApu-modified starch were significantly lower, and amylose content and amylopectin branch chains B1 (DP 13-24) significantly higher (P < 0.05), than those of natural corn starch. These changes in molecular structure partially explained the reduced digestibility. High optimal temperature of SMApu facilitated the simultaneous gelatinisation and hydrolysis of cereal starch. These results demonstrate that SMApu has potential applications in the production of SDS during thermal processing of cereal foods.

AB During the ageing period, diverse physicochemical changes occur affecting the quality of the final product. For this reason, it is important to study and optimize this step. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and UV-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopic techniques combined with multivariate analysis were used to obtain regression models to correlate both spectroscopic data and chromatic parameters with the ageing level of high quality Sherry wines. Three spectral ranges were obtained that contain the highest variance: two different fingerprint ranges in FT-IR (1100-2000 cm(-1) and 2300-2999 cm(-1)) and one range in the visible region (380-450 nm). The regression model has enabled full differentiation between the seven levels of ageing in the wine explored. A good linear regression fit (R-2 above 0.95) was obtained regardless of the ranges used. The results demonstrate that both spectroscopic techniques can be used to optimize the ageing process in a simple and fast way.

AB Nowadays, consumers expect to be sure that a food product complies with its label and demand further information regarding the geographical origin of the product. Beverages are among the most likely foods to be the target of food fraud. Adulteration through practices including, among the others, mixing or substituting the original material with other materials or useless parts of the same materials, which do not conform to the official standards and the food label, originate non-authentic beverages. For the determination of beverage authenticity, chemical, biomolecular and isotopic approaches could be applied depending on the level in the structure of the matter for obtaining the target information. This review highlights the recent key studies and related analytical approaches on authentication of beverages including fruit juices, coffee and tea, and wine and other alcoholic beverages.

AB An untargeted method using headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled to electronic nose based on mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/MS-eNose) in combination with chemometrics was developed for the discrimination of oranges of three geographical origins (Italy, South Africa and Spain). Three multivariate statistical models, i.e. PCA/LDA, SELECT/LDA and PLS-DA, were built and relevant performances were compared. Among the tested models, SELECT/LDA provided the highest prediction abilities in cross-validation and external validation with mean values of 97.8% and 95.7%, respectively. Moreover, HS-SPME/GC-MS analysis was used to identify potential markers to distinguish the geographical origin of oranges. Although 28 out of 65 identified VOCs showed a different content in samples belonging to different classes, a pattern of analytes able to discriminate simultaneously samples of three origins was not found. These results indicate that the proposed MS-eNose method in combination with multivariate statistical analysis provided an effective and rapid tool for authentication of the orange's geographical origin.

AB For brewers, it is important to know the geographic origins of the hop plants (Humulus lupulus L.) used in their brewing processes since the contents and compositions of the bitter resins and essential oils in them depend on the environmental conditions during their growth. In this study, the multi-elemental profiles of hop plants from each of the world's main growing regions were determined by non-destructive energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (EDXRF). Understanding the multi-element profiles of the plants could be a useful tool in determining the geographic origins of produced hop plants.

AB The antibacterial effect of PHBV films with oregano or clove essential oil, or their main compounds, carvacrol (CA) and eugenol (EU), respectively, was analysed in food matrices (cheese, chicken breast and pumpkin and melon) and in vitro test for Escherichia coli and Listeria innocua. The migration of CA and EU in the different food matrices was determined to analyse the food matrix effect on the film's antimicrobial effectiveness. The antimicrobial activity in foods was less remarkable than in in vitro test. Despite the antilisterial effect in the in vitro test, this was not noticed in any food matrix. The most significant antibacterial effects against E. coli were observed in cheese and pumpkin, whereas the highest migration of both CA and UE took place in melon. This lack of correlation reflected that many compositional factors affect the active compound's availability to exert its antibacterial action in a specific food.

AB Banana is a fruit widely accepted by people over the world. Besides having delicious taste, it shows multiple health benefits. In this work, the major polysaccharide was isolated from banana and purified. It was identified to be alpha-(1 -> 6)-D-glucan. The in vivo immunomodulatory activity assay indicated that alpha-(1 -> 6)-D-glucan could improve the immune status by elevating T cell proliferation, phagocytic function of macrophage, CD3(+) T cell level, CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio, IL-6, IgG, IgM, TNF-alpha and hemolysin antibody levels. The immunostimulatory activities of alpha-(1 -> 6)-D-glucan were similar to beta-(1 -> 3)-D-glucan, a clinical immunostimulatory drug. This work revealed that alpha-(1 -> 6)-D-glucan was an important bioactive chemical for the immunostimulatory activity of banana. It could be used as a nutraceuticals candidate.

AB Powerful data pretreatment strategies inspired from the field of metabolomics were adapted to chemical food safety context to enable samples discrimination by multivariate methods based on low abundance ions. A highly automated workflow was produced. The open-source XCMS package was used and efficient data filtration strategies were set up. Data were treated using Independent Components Analysis, and data mining strategies developed to automatically detect and annotate ions of low abundance by coupling blind data exploration strategies with a broad scale database approach. Our method was efficient in discriminating tea samples based on their contamination levels (even at 10 mu g.kg(-1)) and detecting unexpected impurities in the spiking mix. Several "tracer" contaminants were considered, covering a broad range of physicochemical properties and structural diversity with overall 66% detected and annotated blindly. The methodology was successfully applied to a data set exhibiting only 3 "tracer" contaminants (at 50 mu g.kg(-1)) and more product diversity.

   IMPACT
AB With a long-term nutrition goal for healthy aging, the aim of this study was to compare the bioavailability of amino acids, in particular the leucine, after the ingestion of two solid and isocaloric dairy products (cheese) based either on whey or on caseins, by using pig as an in vivo digestion model.
   The whey-based cheese contained 25% more leucine than Mozzarella, however its digestion by pigs resulted in a concentration of postprandial plasma leucine between 2 h and 5 h30 twice higher than that produced during the digestion of Mozzarella. Noting that the dry matter of the duodenal effluents were similar after each of the two cheese meals, differences in gastric emptying would not explain the difference in leucine bioavailability.
   These results suggest the possibility of stimulating more efficiently the muscle synthesis in elderly people with cheese based on whey proteins rather than those based on caseins.

AB The carbon stable isotopic composition (delta C-13) is often analyzed to quantify the addition of acidulants to Japanese apricot liqueur, but little is known about the variation in the delta C-13 values of the main organic acids arising from differences in the ripeness of Japanese apricots. We show that in Japanese apricot liqueur prepared using fruits at different stages of ripeness, the delta C-13 values of citric acid and malic acid ranged from -25.1 parts per thousand to -23.7 parts per thousand and from -22.3 parts per thousand to -19.7 parts per thousand, respectively, and the delta C-13 values decreased as the fruit ripened. The average delta C-13 value of citric acid from liqueurs was 0.7 parts per thousand higher than that from fresh fruits, whereas the delta C-13 values of malic acid showed no isotope discrimination. The variation in delta C-13 values of the main organic acids in Japanese apricot liqueurs will help detect acidulant addition and control authenticity.

AB A protein analysis in the pulp of Moro blood oranges (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) at the onset and after 30 days of storage at either 4 or 9 degrees C was performed. All differential proteins belonged to different functional classes (sugar, amino acid and secondary metabolism, defense, stress response, oxidative process, transport and cellular component biogenesis), displaying a differential accumulation in those Moro oranges kept at 9 versus 4 degrees C, and in those stored at 4 degrees C versus onset. Anthocyanin biosynthesis structural proteins chalcone synthases and flavonone 3-hydroxylase and different glutathione S-transferases related with their vacuolar transport were up-accumulated in fruits kept at 9 versus 4 degrees C and versus the onset. Proteins related with defense and oxidative stress displayed a similar pattern, concomitant with a higher anthocyanin content, denoting a possible role of defense and other stress response pathways in anthocyanin production/accumulation.

AB The changes of flavour profiles in lentil protein isolate (LPI) in response to organic solvent treatments (acetone, ethanol, and isopropanol; 35-95% v/v), and the resulting impacts on the isolate colour and physicochemical and functional attributes were investigated. The major constituents of volatile compounds were aldehydes (similar to 46.59%) and (E,E)-3,5-octadien-2-one (similar to 31.79%) in the untreated LPI. Acetone treatment greatly raised ketones by similar to 79.59%. In contrast, ethanol and isopropanol, except at 95% (v/v), significantly lowered total volatile compounds and had higher protein contents (similar to 84.55%) than the others (similar to 76.98%); surface charge, surface hydrophobicity, solubility and emulsion stability of these LPIs were examined. LPIs obtained from 75% (v/v) ethanol and isopropanol treatments showed slightly lower solubility but improved surface hydrophobicity to produce emulsions with a similar stability as compared with the untreated LPI. Overall, ethanol and isopropanol treatments (75% v/v) produced high quality off-flavour-reduced LPIs which may be used in various food systems.

AB The objective of this work was to study molecular binding between beta-carotene (beta-C) and whey protein isolate (WPI) as a function of pH (4-9), temperature (15, 25, and 35 degrees C), and NaCl concentration (0-0.25 M) using spectroscopic techniques and docking studies. The fluorescence quenching data showed that binding affinity increased with pH, temperature and ionic strength. The binding was entropy driven and involved mostly hydrophobic interactions. Three major whey proteins including beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg), alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-Lac), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were bound to beta-C with overall binding constant values of 1.31 x 10(7), 1.80 x 10(4), and 4.51 x 10(4)M(-1), respectively. A single class of binding sites for beta-C on whey fractions was recognized using Job's method. Docking results revealed beta-C was bound to the subdomain IIA of BSA, the residues of aromatic cluster II in alpha-lactalbumin and into the calyx of beta-lactoglobulin resulting in conformational changes in the secondary and tertiary structures of proteins.

AB Compositional variation was examined across 13 microgreens species/subspecies representing Brassicaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Lamiaceae, Malvaceae and Apiaceae, grown in controlled environment. Macro-mineral concentrations were determined by ion chromatography, chlorophyll and ascorbate concentrations, and hydrophilic/lipophilic antioxidant potentials by spectrophotometry, and major carotenoids by HPLC-DAD. Nitrate hyper-accumulators and wide genotypic differences in Na, K and S concentrations were identified. Antioxidant capacity was highest in brassicaceous microgreens and significant genotypic variation was demonstrated in chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations. High phenolic content was confirmed in Lamiaceae microgreens, with significant varietal differences, and alternative phenolics-rich microgreens from the Apiaceae were identified. Twenty-eight phenolic compounds were variably detected and quantitated through Orbitrap LC-MS/MS with flavonol glycosides, flavones and flavone glycosides, and hydroxycinnamic acids representing 67.6, 24.8 and 7.6% of the mean total phenolic content across species, respectively. The obtained information is critical for selecting new species/varieties of microgreens that may satisfy demand for both taste and health.

AB The aim of this study was to fully characterize the main pigmented rice varieties, available to consumers on the Italian market, in terms of carotenoids, total phenolic compounds and anthocyanins, and to investigate the effect of cooking on these components.
   Lutein was the main carotenoid in all samples under investigation (0.33-4.11 mu g/g d.m.), while anthocyanins were observed only in black genotypes. Phenolic compounds were found mainly in free form, and values ranged between 544.1 and 1508.3 mg/100 g (d.m.) in raw samples. Cooking decreased significantly (p < 0.05) total lutein, free phenolic compound and anthocyanin content. In contrast, the increase of insoluble-bound phenolic compounds was observed in some samples, after cooking.
   The study provides data contributing to gain a better knowledge in novel food composition and enabling the estimation of dietary intake of health-promoting components.

AB Astaxanthin and beta-carotene are important carotenoids used in numerous pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications, owing to their vigorous antioxidant properties. The microalgal strains Haematococcus pluvialis and Dunaliella salina accumulate the highest quantities of astaxanthin and beta-carotene (up to 7% and 13% dry weight respectively) and are therefore considered as sustainable feedstock for the commercial production of carotenoids. Thus, from an economical perspective, it becomes desirable to optimize recovery of carotenoids from microalgal cells. To this end, here, we have summarized the conventional and modern extraction techniques generally used for the recovery of astaxanthin from Haematococcus pluvialis and beta-carotene from Dunaliella salina. Furthermore, we have also discussed the optimum process conditions employed for numerous extraction protocols including solvent extraction, ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE), microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE). Overall, our study highlights the sustainability of integrated co-production of biofuels and carotenoids in a biorefinery framework.

AB Nitrogen fertilization regimes significantly affect both grain quality and yield. Wheat plants were subjected to different application timing of topdressed nitrogen at the emergence of the top fifth (TL5), top third (TL3) and top first leaf (TL1), respectively. The iTRAQ (isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation) technology was adopted to obtain the complete proteome of wheat flour and to identify the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) as regulated by nitrogen topdressing timing. Collectively, 591 proteins into 17 functional categories in flour of mature grains were identified. In comparison to TL3, 50 and 63 DEPs were identified in TL5 and TL1, respectively. Nine of the DEPs commonly dependent on nitrogen topdressing timing are the gamma-gliadins or high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits. Additionally, delaying nitrogen topdressing modified the grain hardness and allergic protein content. The results suggested that altering nitrogen topdressing timing is a potential strategy for pursuing targeted processing quality of wheat flour.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the contamination of widely consumed rice brands in Tehran, Iran with three heavy metals: arsenic, lead, and cadmium. To this end, 250 rice samples were collected and 90 samples out of them were analyzed using ICP-MS. Finally, human health risk assessment were performed. Our results showed that the average of lead, cadmium, and arsenic concentrations in Indian rice type was significantly higher than Iranian and Pakistani types (P < 0.05). Among the three metals, the highest impact on the total value of non-carcinogenic risk was related to As. In addition, the non-carcinogenic risk value only for the Indian rice type, was above the permitted level (1.0). Also, we found that the carcinogenic risk of arsenic in all three rice types was higher than the acceptable limit (10(-4)). According to findings, special attention should be paid to reducing arsenic especially in Indian rice through interventions.

AB The current investigation was performed to evaluate the chemical analytical techniques for PAHs (organic, carcinogenic and mutagenic compounds) in food. It also determines the content of eight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in frequently consumed fruit, vegetables, meats and their products. The methodology included saponification or ultrasonication, liquid-liquid extraction with solvents like n-hexane, clean-up using a silica solid phase extraction cartridge and a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technique. A good linearity (R-2 > 0.99) was achieved for the PAHs at different concentrations. Recovery results for PAHs extended from 88.75 to similar to 100.00%. The limit of detection was 0.08-0.25 mu g/kg and the limit of quantification was 0.24-0.75 mu g/kg. The mean concentration (n=3) of benzo[a] pyrene was not identified in fruits, was 0.05 mu g/kg in vegetables, and 0.64 mu g/kg in meat products. Overall concentration of the eight PAHs was 0.67 mu g/kg in fruits, 0.82 mu g/kg in vegetables, and 3.37 mu g/kg in meat products.

AB Phytotoxins refers to toxic chemicals derived from plants. They include both secondary metabolites that are dose-dependently toxic and allergens that can cause anaphylactic shock in sensitive individuals. Detecting phytotoxins in foods is increasingly important. Conventional methods for detecting phytotoxins lack sufficient sensitivity and operational convenience. Nanomaterial-based determination assays show great competence in fast and accurate sensing of trace substances. In the present review, representative phytotoxin categories of alkaloids, cyanides, and proteins are discussed. Application of notable nanomaterials, e.g. carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, magnetic nanoparticles, metal-based nanotools, and quantum dots, in specific sensing strategies to fit the physiochemical properties of the target toxins are summarized. Nanomaterials mainly play four roles in phytotoxin detection: 1) analyte enricher; 2) sensor structure mediator; 3) target recognizer or reactant; 4) signaling agent. Great achievements have been made in the detection of trace plant-derived toxins in food matrices, yet there are still challenges awaiting further investigation.

AB Withering is considered a crucial stage of black tea processing. In this study, tea shoots from two cultivars (cvs. Yabukita and Clone 2) were stored at 5 degrees C, in either a low or high vapour pressure deficit (VPD) environment, to determine the impact of different withering rates on physiology (viz. respiration rate [RR], colour and moisture loss) and biochemical profile (viz. individual catechins, methylxanthines) of tea shoots (Camellia sinensis). Low VPD and high VPD conditions during withering increased caffeine levels in Clone 2 and Yabukita, respectively (p < 0.05). Caffeine levels steadily increased over time in both cultivars (p < 0.05), coinciding with a rapid decline in theobromine (TB). Furthermore, stems contained lower epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and caffeine (ca. 75 and 56%, respectively) compared to bud and larger leaf (LL) (p < 0.05). Overall, the results of this study highlight factors such as mechanical harvesting, and hard or soft withering, which could affect final tea beverage quality.

AB Herein, we perform the regioselective acetylation of phloridzin catalyzed by immobilized Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB). We show that the enzyme amount and reaction time can significantly influence the composition of mono-, di- and tri-acetylated phloridzin in the product. The last acetylated derivative of phloridzin is isolated and identified as 4, 3 '', 6 ''-3-O-acetyl-phloridzin by HPLC, UV, IR, MS and NMR. Molecular docking suggests that the first acetylation of phloridzin catalyzed by CALB occurs in 6 ''-OH, followed by 3 ''-OH, then 4-OH. During this process, hydrogen bond and hydrophobic forces play an important role in maintaining the binding interaction of CALB with phloridzin or its acetylated derivatives. Although, tri-acetylated phloridzin has moderate to minimal adverse-effects on LO-2, its anti-proliferative activity against human HepG2 cancer cells is superior to that of phloridzin, which attributes to its high capacity of inducing cell apoptosis, retarding cell cycle, lowering mitochondrial membrane potential and scavenging intracellular ROS.

SO FOOD CHEMISTRY

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB The need of controlling illegal addition of water buffalo (WB) milk from foreign countries to the Italian counterpart devoted to the production of Protected Denomination of Origin (PDO) Mozzarella di Bufala Campana (MBC) cheese has promoted the development of simple, fast and cheap isoelectrofocusing (IEF) methods for evaluating the nature of the raw material to be used according to a high-throughput sample multiplexing format, avoiding the use of dedicated mass spectrometry-based procedures. Thus, combined proteomic methods were here integrated with optimized western blotting protocols in solving the complex IEF pattern of casein (CN) mixtures observed when Italian and foreign WB milk are mixed together. Identification of internally deleted alpha(s1)-CN hepta-phosphorylated species as well as of still unknown beta-CN A hexa-phosphorylated and N-terminally-nicked beta-CN A phosphorylated forms present uniquely in foreign WB milk samples, allowed recognizing these molecules as adulteration markers to be assayed in combined IEF-immunoblotting procedures; the latter ones showing optimal migration characteristics to be used in routine assays. A linear relationship between detected area of specific immunorecognized gel bands and percentage of international WB milk added to the Italian counterpart was verified, demonstrating that this method has an adulteration detection limit close to 3% v/ v. Based on these results, this analytical procedure is here proposed as optimal one for evaluating the authenticity of PDO MBC cheese products.

AB Emulsification approach is widely employed to deliver beneficial agents to liquid food products, whereas utilizing emulsions with solid food is scarce. In this research, coarse and nano emulsions of citral were prepared and embedded in chitosan or carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) polysaccharides to form active edible coatings for solid-state delivery. Polysaccharides stabilized the emulsions by electrostatic interactions, while chitosan also prevented coalescence. The nano emulsion based films showed a more organized and dense morphology (E-SEM), higher water vapor barrier, better mechanical features (strength, elasticity and Young modulus) than the coarse ones. When applied on a solid food model, fresh-cut melons, the nanoemulsified edible coatings demonstrated a superior antimicrobial protection (up to a 5-log reduction) and significantly extended product's storability (up to 13 days). The presented approach could be further employed for the delivery of other beneficial agents (nutrients, aroma, antimicrobial, antioxidants) to solid food products, contributing a general progress in this field.

AB In this study, we created oleogel-based formulations featuring varying degrees of beeswax for internal structure and whey protein isolate (WPI) as external coating to improve the oxidative stability of fish oil. Oleogel was characterized by rheological analysis to access gelation behavior, and morphology was visualized using electron microscopy. It was found that the WPI-coated oleogel displayed strong physical stability during storage. The oxidative assay demonstrated that WPI-coated oleogel had the best protection against fish oil oxidation under both thermal treatment and ultraviolet-C radiation. The oxidation of fish oil was inhibited by 2-3 fold, compared to its unencapsulated form. This stability was attributed to the modulation of beeswax and WPI on the micropolarity and microviscosity of the formulation, as evidenced by pyrene fluorescence measurement. Our approach combining internal structuring and external coating may contribute to the development of oleogel system for efficient delivery of lipophilic bioactive components.

AB An effective and trustworthy traceability system is important for food safety and quality; however, traditional traceability systems that only rely on the recording method do not completely prevent food fraud. DNA-based traceability techniques facilitate seamless connectivity within the entire food supply chain. A convenient and low-cost ear tag device was invented for collecting animal blood samples as an identity control, and a panel including 12 single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) loci was selected to distinguish individuals with a matching probability of 1.70 x 10(-5). The exact animal individual was identified by comparing the SNP genotype barcodes between the meat and blood samples derived from the recording system to further validate authenticity of the recording system. These results illustrate that a combination of the genetic traceability method and a traditional recording system can provide trustworthy traceability for consumers.

AB Low-Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance of proton transverse relaxation signal (T-2) was monitored in hake (Merluccius merluccius) mince with different thermal histories (fresh, frozen, cooked) as affected by pH, water and NaCl addition, and it was related to water holding capacity (WHC). Modifications of T-2 signals were found in terms of changes in relaxation times and relative abundance of the relaxation components. The relaxation rate of the major component (1/T-21) increased significantly upon frozen storage or pH increase, whereas water or NaCl addition had the opposite effect. WHC decreased with freezing or water addition and increased with NaCl or basic pH; thus, T-2 and WHC best correlated when each factor was analysed separately. Linearity found for pH and protein concentration with 1/T-21 was consistent with chemical exchange being responsible for these changes. The significance of these results for technological situations where compositional and biochemical changes are occurring is discussed.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the added jujube pulp on the quality characteristics and antioxidant activities of goat milk yogurt (GMY) during 28 days of refrigerated storage. Four GMY formulations were prepared, each varying in the added jujube pulp amount (Y0: not containing jujube pulp; YJ3, YJ6, YJ9: containing 3, 6, 9 g of jujube pulp per 100 g GMY, respectively). There was no significant differences in the viable counts, pH values and titratable acidities of all formulations during the storage. All formulations showed the viable counts all above 106 CFU/mL over the assessed storage period. However, YJ3 exhibited the desirable hardness, adhesiveness and water holding capacity. Moreover, the addition of jujube pulp weakened greatly the goaty flavor, improving the sensory acceptance, and increased the antioxidant activities of GMY. Therefore, GMY containing jujube pulp is optional for developing a novel goat dairy product with high added values.

AB This work presents a multisyringe flow injection analysis (MSFIA) system for the automatic spectrophotometric determination of total iron in wine. The reaction is based on the complexation of Fe(II) with 2-(5-bromo-2-pyridylazo)-5-(diethylamino)-phenol (Br-PADAP). Ascorbic acid was used as reducing reagent for Fe(III) to Fe(II) and, in this way, to determine the total iron content in wine. The absorbance of the Fe(II)-(Br-PADAP)(2) complex was measured at 748 nm. The proposed method provided a working rage from 0.36 to 5 mg L-1 of Fe(II), with a detection limit of 0.11 mg L-1 of Fe(II), a relative standard deviation of 0.42% (3 mg L-1 of Fe(II), n=10), and a 46 h(-1) injection throughput. The system is very simple, rapid and selective, and has been successfully applied to determine total iron in red, rose and white wine without any need for sample pre-treatment steps. The results agree well with ICP-AES, which used as a reference method.

AB DPPH center dot scavenging activity and antioxidant activity in canola oil of alpha-terpinene, BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) and acetic, malic and citric acids and their mixtures were determined to examine the synergistic effect on the antioxidant activity. The results demonstrated that alpha-terpinene and organic acids had low or any activity against DPPH center dot and BHT showed an IC50 of 0.035 mM. When mixed with organic acids, alpha-terpinene increased its activity showing a synergistic effect. The mix of alpha-terpinene (1.58 mM) and citric acid (2.91 mM) showed the higher synergistic effect in DPPH center dot (121.82). BHT scavenging activity was inhibited by organic acids. Although the DPPH center dot scavenging activity was enhanced for alpha-terpinene and inhibited for BHT by organic acids, the antioxidant activity in canola oil was not. It indicated that the scavenging DPPH activity and antioxidant activity in canola oil of a compound or a mixture of compounds are not always positively correlated with each other.

AB A new assay for the selective and sensitive aptamer-based fluorescent biosensor for ochratoxin A (OTA) detection is proposed. It consists of a ribonuclease H (RNase H)-assisted cycle response that leads to a significant amplification of the signal, which allow for a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.08 ng/mL. By using this technique, a high selectivity for OTA against ochratoxin B and aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) was noticed. The quantitative determination in real samples has been verified using red wine samples spiked with a series of OTA concentrations (0.4, 4, and 12 ng/mL), and the recoveries ranged from 96.1 to 107.5%. This aptasensor has great practical applications in food industry and moreover, can be extended for the detection of other toxins by replacing the sequence of the recognition aptamer.

AB Baobab fruit (Adansonia digitata) pulp has received a growing attention globally for its numerous nutritional and medicinal values. However, only limited information is available about its phytochemical composition. The purpose of this study was to identify the phytochemicals in baobab fruit pulp using LC-MS/QTOF and evaluate the effects of solvents on phenolic compounds content and antioxidant activity. The LC-MS analysis led to the identification of 46 compounds, based on standards and comparison with literature reports. Proanthocyanidins, phenolic acids, flavonols, and saponins were the most common compounds. The best solvent for Total Phenolic Compounds Content (TPCC), TPC, TFC and antioxidant activity was also defined: 80% acetone was the best for TPCC, TFC and FRAP, 30% acetone for TPC and 50% methanol for DPPH. Considering all the results, 80% acetone was determined as the best solvent for sample extraction. A high correlation was observed between phenolic compounds content and antioxidant activity.

AB So far, the chemical quality of different grades of white tea has largely remained unexplored. The objective of this study was to establish a model for quality evaluation of different grades of Bai Mudan white tea. We applied non-targeted ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in combination with multivariate analysis and analyzed four different grades of Bai Mudan white tea. We found that the metabolite composition from the super-grade and the first-grade shared higher similarity compared to the second-grade or the third-grade white tea, and the Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis model showed high capability to explain the sample variation (R2Y = 0.998, Q2 = 0.95 in negative ionization modes). In total, 93 metabolites were structurally identified, wherein 21 low abundant metabolites showed distinct changes in abundance that were closely correlated with tea grade variation. These findings suggested their potential as markers to discriminate different grades of Bai Mudan white tea.

AB This paper presents a novel multi-residue method for the enantioselective analysis of 22 chiral pesticides in cucumber, tomato, cabbage, grape, mulberry, apple and pear at enantiomeric levels. Pesticides were efficiently extracted by magnetic solid-phase extraction based on graphene as sorbent. Response surface methodology was used to assist the multivariable optimization. The perfect chiral separation of the enantiomers was achieved on a Chiralpak IG column within 47 min by reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, which is a significant improvement to resolve a large group of chiral compounds under one set of conditions. The method was validated in terms of selectivity, linearity, sensitivity, trueness and precision, which all satisfy the requirement for pesticides residue analysis. The proposed method was successfully applied for monitoring the occurrence and enantiomeric composition of pesticides in different fruits and vegetables, demonstrating its applicability for the routine analysis of chiral pesticide residues in food samples.

AB The present study proposed the cheese differentiation, according to geographical production area and with respect to species (cow, sheep) of two traditional cheese specialties, (salty and ripened), produced in Transylvania, Romania. For this purpose, the elemental profile and carbon isotopic ratios (C-13/C-12) of cheese and extracted casein were corroborated through statistic supervised techniques to get the best discrimination markers. The manganese content, along with Rare Earth Elements (REE) concentrations, proved to be very powerful predictors, for the traditional salted cheese mainly, due to the direct influence of the local salted water. Despite that proposed techniques are not acknowledged methods for species differentiation, this approach allowed a successful discrimination of the animal species that produced the raw materials for cheese manufacturing (milk). The results generated by the developed chemometric model, for species differentiation, were compared with those obtained using Isoelectric focusing (IEF) and DNA tests. The proposed association of isotopic and elemental markers allowed a differentiation better than 92% for geographical provenance, of each investigated cheese specialties while, for species discrimination (cow vs. sheep) a percentage of 100% was obtained.

AB The enzymatic hydrolysis (at 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 15.0% degree of hydrolysis, DH) of kilka fish (Clupeonella cultriventris caspia) was investigated using a crude melon extract (CME) as well as a commercial serine protease (Alcalase). Hydrolysates from both enzymatic treatments were analyzed for their antioxidant and functional properties. The hydrolysis resulted in increased antioxidant activities of kilka fish protein hydrolysates and the highest antioxidant activity was obtained for the CME hydrolysates with 5.0% DH level. Both treatments improved the protein solubility level to > 65% within a pH range of 2.0-10.0. At a given DH level, CME hydrolysates showed higher oil and water holding capacities than Alcalase hydrolysates. Hydrolysates from CME exhibited better emulsifying properties compared to those prepared by Alcalase, particularly at low DH (2.5 and 5.0%). According to the results of this study, CME can be suggested as a new source of proteolytic enzymes for fish protein hydrolysis.

AB Recent studies have shown that aronia (black chokeberry) and haskap fruits (contain anthocyanins) have beneficial health effects in animals and humans. However, some reports have shown that anthocyanin is poorly absorbed in the small intestine. In this study, we compared the intestinal absorption of aronia and haskap anthocyanins by using rats with a ligated small intestinal loop and cannulated portal vein.
   Our results clearly showed that the intestinal absorption of aronia anthocyanins was significantly lower than that of haskap anthocyanins, suggesting that the intestinal absorption of anthocyanins is influenced by the glycoside type (galactoside or glucoside).
   In addition, we also examined the effects of capsaicin and capsiate on intestinal anthocyanin absorption. The amount of aronia anthocyanins in portal blood was much higher when they were co-administered with capsaicin or capsiate. Our study is the first to show that the intestinal absorption of aronia anthocyanins is promoted by capsaicin and capsiate.

AB The effect and mechanisms of calcium chloride and citric acid addition on the acid method of processing tilapia protein isolates and surimi gels were studied. The alkaline method shows better gel quality than the acid method with lower yield and high lipid content. The addition of calcium chloride increased the breaking force to 494.56 g and citric acid helped reducing the lipid content by 85.85%, resulting in a higher yield of 75.36%. Gels with calcium maintained low levels of expressible moisture (2.30%), indicating a well-organised gel matrix. The decrease in -SH content and increase in ionic bonds content suggested increased formation of disulphide bonds and ionic bonds. Oscillatory dynamic measurement indicated that more heat resistant bonds were formed. The morphology of myofibril proteins studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed that the height of the proteins in the calcium-added gels decreased 79.4%, which suggested that the protein structure was "suppressed".

AB A sensitive and straightforward LC-IT-TOF-MS method was validated for the profiling and simultaneous quantification of anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, flavonols, phenolic acids, and resveratrol in blueberry genotypes with fruit color ranging from deep purple (Vaccinium angustifolium) to various shades of pink (crosses of V. corymbosum, V. darrowii, and V. ashei). Standard calibration curves were linear for all analytes with correlation coefficients > 0.99. The relative standard deviation for intra- and inter-day precision was lower than 10%. The method allowed an easy and selective identification and quantification of phenolics in blueberries with divergent profiles. The in vitro antioxidant assay results were strongly correlated with total phenolics and total anthocyanin content. Lowbush blueberry extracts (50 mu g/mL) reduced ROS and NO production, and inhibited the transcription of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 beta, COX2, iNOS, and IL-6 in the in vitro assays at much lower concentrations than pink fruited berries (250 mu g/mL).

AB There is limited research concentrating on the effects of gut microbiota on the bioaccessibility and speciation of chromium (Cr) in vegetables. In this study, the physiologically based extraction test (PBET) and the unified BARGE method (UBM), were combined with the simulator of human intestinal microbial ecosystems (SHIME) to determine the bioaccessibility and speciation of Cr from vegetables. The results showed that the Cr bioaccessibility was the highest in the gastric phase. The Cr bioaccessibility from the water spinach was the highest, and was 1.6-3.4 and 1.1-1.8 times that of leaf lettuce and celery, respectively. The Cr bioaccessibilities of the UBM method were slightly greater than those of the PBET method. Additionally, the gut microbiota increased the Cr bioaccessibility and reduced more toxic Cr(VI) to less toxic Cr(III) from vegetables. Therefore, our study reveals the possible health risks of consuming Cr-contaminated vegetables based on the bioaccessibility and speciation of Cr.

AB The non-isothermal autohydrolysis temperature impact of edible brown seaweed Laminaria ochroleuca was studied to recover high valuable compounds. Extraction yield was determined, above 80% was obtained at 220 degrees C. The maximal fucose content (17% d.b.) was attained at 180 degrees C, whereas the maximal sulphate was achieved at 160 degrees C, and phenolic and protein content at 220 degrees C. The maximum sulphated fucoidan content (41.38 g fucoidan/100g extract) was obtained at 160 degrees C, whereas the maximum fucose oligosaccharides was obtained at 180 degrees C. The antioxidant capacity was equivalent to 32 mg Trolox/g dry extract produced at 220 degrees C. The milder processing condition was selected to study the potentiality of the precipitated alginate in terms of viscoelastic properties determined by rheology. Alginate extraction (14.94 g/100 g extract) was determined at 160 degrees C. The crude fucoidan fractions were tested at 25-500 mu g/mL, showed up to 50% cell growth inhibition in four selected tumoral cell lines.

AB High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) processing is a non-thermal technology reported to increase desirable metabolites in plant foods. This work evaluated changes in carotenoid accumulation in fresh-cut papaya fruit as affected by HHP treatment (50-400 MPa for 3-60 min) and during subsequent storage at 4 degrees C; simultaneously, transcriptional activities of carotenoid biosynthetic genes and oxidative stress markers were evaluated. LC-MS analyses revealed that HHP treatment increased carotenoid precursors and carotenes contents following processing and storage: lycopene levels increased up to 11-fold compared to the non-treated samples, and H2O2 and lipid peroxidation were concomitantly increased. qRT-PCR of intact RNA showed that the amount of phytoene desaturase transcripts increased after HHP treatment, and that they were correlated with carotene accumulation. This is the first study to show that HHP treatment triggers de novo carotenoid biosynthesis, which is regulated at the transcriptional level, possibly by inducing oxidative stress signaling in fruit tissue.

AB Gelatin is widely used in gummy candies because of its unique functional properties. Generally, porcine and bovine gelatins are used in the food industry. FTIR-ATR combined with chemometrics analysis such as hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) (OPUS Version 7.2 software), principal component analysis (PCA) (OPUS Version 7.2 software) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) (Matlab R2017b) were used for classification and discrimination of gelatin gummy candies related to their gelatin source. The spectral region between 1734 and 1528 cm(-1) was selected for chemometric analysis. The potential of FTIR spectroscopy for determination of bovine and porcine source in gummy candies was examined and validated by a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Twenty commercial samples were tested by developed ATR-FTIR methodology and RT-PCR technique, mutually confirming and supporting results were obtained. Gummy candies were classified and discriminated in relation to the bovine or porcine source of gelatin with 100% success without any sample preparation using FTIR-ATR technique.

AB To link and harmonize different knowledge repositories with respect to isotopic data, we propose an ISO-FOOD ontology as a domain ontology for describing isotopic data within Food Science. The ISO-FOOD ontology consists of metadata and provenance data that needs to be stored together with data elements in order to describe isotopic measurements with all necessary information required for future analysis. The new domain has been linked with existing ontologies, such as Units of Measurements Ontology, Food, Nutrient and the Bibliographic Ontology. To show how such an ontology can be used in practise, it was populated with 20 isotopic measurements of Slovenian food samples. Describing data in this way offers a powerful technique for organizing and sharing stable isotope data across Food Science.

AB The purpose of this investigation was to assess the grape pigment extraction during red-winemaking. The pigment content and profile of skin, wines and pomace of Vitis vinifera grapes with different pigment profiles Syrah, Marselan and Tannat was thoroughly studied. The p-coumaroylated anthocyanin proportions were 37% in pomace, compared to 19% in skins and just 5% in wines, highlighting their poor extraction. Di-methoxylated based anthocyanins, increased their relative contribution in pomace and wines compared to skins, indicating they were less extracted, but more stable once extracted. Remarkably, the caffeoylated anthocyanins presented significantly higher concentrations in pomace than in skins (1.9 fold on average), suggesting that their synthesis could take place during vinification. Malvidin 3-feruloyl-glucoside was found in the Tannat samples being the first evidence of an anthocyanin acylated with ferulic acid in wine. Pigment extraction was selective depending on anthocyanin B-ring substitution pattern and acylation profile.

AB Pistachio hull is a substantial source of natural polyphenols, but a substantial volume is being wasted annually. Aqueous pistachio green hull extract (PGHE) was subjected to two-stage membrane process in order to separate a polyphenol rich fraction. The membrane conditions of each stage were investigated. Total phenolic content and antioxidant activity were determined by Folin-Ciocalteu and DPPH assay; also membrane fouling was monitored. The use of the 1 kDa cellulose membrane accompanied by 4 bar pressure and 250 rpm stirring speed was observed to be successful in the separation of a fraction with the highest amount of phenolic compound and antioxidant activity, in the retentate part. UHPLC/MSn characterization of PGHE polyphenols enabled us to identify 34 compounds, including the most abundant galloylshikimic acids, gallic acid, theogallin, galloyl-O-hexoside, quercetin-O-hexoside and pyrogallol.

AB A new cationic gemini surfactant-resorcinol/formaldehyde resin was designed and synthesized. Cationic gemini surfactant was introduced into the resorcinol/formaldehyde resin for the first time and led to the retention of negatively charged endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) through electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding and p-p interactions. The synthesized material showed good performance in the dispersive micro-solid phase extraction (D-mu-SPE) of EDCs such as alkylphenol and phenoxy acid herbicides from food packaging migrants. Extraction parameters such as pH, adsorbent dose, extraction time and salting out effect were optimized. The limits of detections were in the range of 0.5-0.8 ng/mL, and the recoveries were in the range of 90-100%. The developed method was applied to the analysis of EDCs from food contacting materials migrants with pentachlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and bisphenol A detected in the concentration range of 0.2-1.2 mg/kg. It also showed great potential in the D-mu-SPE of other compounds with negative charge or high hydrophobicity.

GC-MS and GC analysis revealed that limonene contents remained relative stable and no evidence of transformation was observed at stimulatory concentrations. Metabolomics analysis showed that 61 metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, sugars, nucleosides, fatty acids, and their derivatives, were significantly changed (P < 0.05), suggesting the transitions between soluble sugars and energy-related metabolisms. Proteomic analysis demonstrated that proteins in energy-related pathways and ROS homeostasis were also influenced. These were further confirmed by the activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), the contents of reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and glutathione (GSH). Our present research indicates that ROS homeostasis is involved in the limonene induced spore germination of P. digitatum.

AB Physicochemical properties of casein (CN) materials manufactured using different processes are well studied; however, data on their bioaccessibility or bioactivity are limited. We compared the digestion patterns and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-releasing activities of micellar CN concentrate (MCC) and sodium caseinate (SCN). MCC and SCN mixed with whey protein isolate (SCN + WPI) were subjected to in vitro gastrointestinal digestion; the digestibility of MCC was higher than that of SCN + WPI, and both CN materials showed different patterns of peptides released after in vitro digestion. A comparison of GLP-1-releasing activities showed that MCC induced GLP-1 secretion to a greater extent than SCN + WPI. Candidate peptides identified from CN digesta were chemically synthesized to test their GLP-1-releasing activity. GPVRGPFPIIV identified only in the MCC digesta, could stimulate GLP-1 release. In conclusion, the digestion patterns and GLP-1-releasing activity of CN materials depend on the production process.

TI Improving the taste of autumn green tea with tannase
SO FOOD CHEMISTRY

DE Autumn green tea; Catechins; pH; Tannase; Taste
AB Green tea processed from autumn leaves is more bitter and astringent than that from spring leaves, mainly due to gallated catechins. The present study aimed to improve the taste of autumn green tea and green tea infusion by using tannase to treat tea leaves and tea infusion. The results showed that, after hydrolysis, the sweet aftertaste and overall acceptability improved, and the ratio of gallated catechins decreased, as did the bitterness and astringency of the autumn green tea. The pH value was significantly correlated with the concentrations of gallated catechins (r = 0.930, p < 0.01), non-gallated catechins (r = -0.893, p < 0.01), and gallic acid (r = 0.915, p < 0.01), as well as with the intensities of bitterness, astringency, and sweet aftertaste during hydrolysis. Gallic acid contributed to the sweet aftertaste of green tea infusion. These results will help to improve autumn green tea products with tannase.

AB The impact of different factors (must protein treatment: bentonite and heat; pomace: fermented with and without; tannin addition: 0-9 g/L; and time of maceration: 0-11 days) on tannin, pigment, and protein extraction/retention in Frontenac wines was investigated. Wine tannin concentration and composition were determined by HPLC-fluorescence. Protein and pigment parameters were analysed by BCA assay and Boulton's method, respectively, using UV-spectrophotometry. Results: Bentonite and heat significantly reduced wine protein concentration at the end of alcoholic fermentation but heat was less efficient than bentonite (1.8-5.0 times less). Removing wine proteins did not improve tannin retention in wines (p > 0.1032) but fermenting without pomace significantly improved their retention (up to 2.4 times), especially that of polymeric flavan-3-ols (up to 27.8%). An addition of 3 g/L of enological tannins in wines, fermented with or without pomace, was necessary to increase wine tannin concentration significantly.

AB In the study, the samples of goat milk, feed, soil and drinking water were firstly collected from nine farms of three provinces in China, the stable isotopic ratios (delta C-13, delta N-15, delta H-2 and delta O-18) in casein, lipid of milk, feed, and drinking water and the contents of 11 elements in milk and soil were determined. Statistical analysis indicated that except the content of Zn, other variables in milk showed significant differences among two or three regions. Significant correlations were found for delta C-13 between casein and lipid (r = 0.953, P < 0.05) and for delta H-2 between casein and milk water (r = 0.816, P < 0.05). The delta H-2 and delta O-18 in casein and milk water were identical to that in corresponding drinking water. Finally, seven key variables (delta N-15(casein), delta O-18(casein), Ni, Se, Rb, Sr and Ba) were selected by stepwise canonical discriminant analysis and the correct classification rate reached 100%.

AB Relevant evidence of rice quality responses to increased temperatures under field condition has been obtained in our previous study. Understanding the intrinsic mechanism of increased temperatures and fertilizer treatment in regulating rice quality formation will be contributed to the development of mitigation measures suitable for actual field operations and to cope with climate warming. This study investigated the potential role of nitrogen fertilizer in regulating the rice quality under field warming through identifying starch-related property indicators. Results showed application of nitrogen fertilizer at heading stage effectively delayed the significantly increased accumulation of total starch, amylose and amylopectin, and reduced the starch particle size, chain length distribution, and crystal structure induced by high temperature, which further compensated the deterioration of rice quality caused by elevated temperature.

AB Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) discolors when it is exposed to light, and such discoloration decreases food quality. To elucidate the discoloration mechanism of Chl-a, we determined discoloration rate in different Chl-a chemical species and assessed the size of Chl-a aggregates in mixed aqueous solutions of methanol and ethanol. Chl-a existed as monomer, J-aggregate, and random aggregate in solutions with different alcohol concentrations. The predominant species depended on the alcohol concentration. Monomeric Chl-a and J-aggregates discolored quickly, whereas random aggregates discolored slowly. Particle sizes of J-aggregates were 319 and 2305 nm in diameter in aqueous solutions of methanol and ethanol, respectively. The sizes of random aggregates were 51 and 79 nm in 10% (v/v) aqueous solutions of methanol and ethanol, respectively. The size of Chl-a aggregates positively correlated with the rate of Chl-a discoloration under UV light. Based on the results obtained, we propose a mechanism of Chl-a discoloration.

AB Mango (Mangifera indica L.) quality is strongly influenced by genotype but individuating the most appropriate harvesting time is essential to obtain high quality fruits. In this trial we studied the influences of the ripening stage at harvest (mature-ripe or green-ripe) on quality of ready to eat mango fruits from nine cultivars (Carrie, Keitt, Glenn, Manzanillo, Maya, Rosa, Osteen, Tommy Atkins and Kensington Pride) grown in the Mediterranean subtropical climate through physicochemical, nutraceutical, and sensory analysis. Our results show a large variability among the different observed genotypes and in dependence of the ripening stage at harvest. With the exception of Rosa, mature-ripe fruits are well-colored, sweet and aromatic, and better suited for short supply chains. On the other hand, post-harvest ripened fruits are firmer, frequently (Carrie, Glenn, Keitt, Manzanillo, Maya) possess interesting nutraceutical value and, in the case of Glenn, Maya, Osteen, and Kensington Pride, they can reach market standard quality.

AB The aim of this study was to assess commercial quality parameters, sugars, phenolics, carotenoids and plastid in diverse and little studied tomato varieties to gain insight into their commercial and functional quality and reveal possible noticeable differences. Five cherry tomato varieties and six common (i.e., non-cherry) tomatoes were evaluated. The highest levels of lycopene were detected in 'Tigerella' and 'Byelsa', and those of phytoene in 'Orange., those of phenolics in 'Green Zebra', all of them common tomatoes. The levels of sugars in both groups of tomatoes were comparable. Interesting differences in plastid carotenoid-accumulating sub-structures as a function of the carotenoid profile were observed. Given the importance of chromoplasts in the deposition of carotenoids in plants and their release during digestion, this information can be valuable in investigations on the regulation of the biosynthesis and the bioavailability of tomato carotenoids.

AB Influence of kernel position on zeaxanthin, lutein, total carotenoid (TC) and quality parameters was evaluated in a zeaxanthin-biofortified and a commercial yellow sweet-corn. Cobs were harvested at six different maturity stages, and the above variables in kernels from the tip-end, middle and base of the cobs were analysed. Kernels from the tip-end had highest zeaxanthin and TC in the zeaxanthin biofortified sweet-corn, and highest lutein and TC in the commercial yellow sweet-corn. In both, the highest concentration was followed by kernels from the middle and then basal kernels. Quality parameters were not significantly affected by kernel position. The current trial indicates that, although kernel position within a cob can significantly affect the carotenoid concentration, this effect is minor compared to the influence of genotype and kernel maturity. However, if a threshold zeaxanthin concentration is to be achieved, the positional effect should be taken into consideration as a contributing factor.

AB A new and simple two-step SFODME using 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (4-NOPD) as a chelating agent was developed for mercury speciation in water and fish samples by ETAAS. For the first step, methylmercury was extracted into 1-undecanol and for the second step, the Hg(II) remaining in the sample solution was complexed with 4-NOPD and then extracted into 1-undecanol. Under the optimized conditions, the calibration graphs of Hg (II) and methylmercury were linear in the range of 0.83-8.0 mu g L-1 and 0.78-8.0 mu g L-1, with the LOD of 0.25 mu g L-1 and 0.24 mu g L-1 and the enrichment factor were 25.7 and 32.2, respectively. The % RSDs was in the range of 2.0-4.4% at concentrations of 0.5 and 4.0 mu g L-1 (n = 5). The proposed method was successfully applied to mercury speciation in water and fish samples. The accuracy of method, tested by the analysis of SRM 1566b and DORM-4 was in good agreement with the certified values.

AB Sweet potato starch products possess unacceptable hardness and poor transparency that in-turn reduces consumer acceptability. To expand the sweet potato starch utility with user acceptable and palatable food products herein enzyme modification has been carried out. Transglucosidase (TGAN) in combination with maltogenic alpha-amylase (MABS) and beta-amylase (BA) appears to be advantageous to modulate sweet potato starch properties. The MABS -> BA -> TGAN treatment increases the alpha-1, 6 glycosidic linkage ratio and short chain proportions (DP <= 24). Decrease in chain length, molecular weight and long chain proportions (DP > 24) is noticed. The initial C-type starch polymorphic structure transforms to B-type structure along with decreased crystallinity. Solubility increases substantially with concomitant decrease in viscosity, gelatinization temperature and melting enthalpy. The outcome is believed to open new pathways for regulating the physicochemical properties of sweet potato starch especially by enzyme modification to the design and development of novel sweet potato starchbased products.

AB The nutritional value of fish fillet can be largely affected by dietary oils. However, little is known about how dietary oils modify lipid molecules in fish fillets. Through biochemical and lipidomics assays, this study demonstrated the molecular characteristics of fillet lipids in Nile tilapia fed with different oils for six weeks. High 18:2n-6 and low 18: 3n-3 deposition in phosphoglycerides resulted high 18:2n-6/18:3n-3 ratio in tilapia. Dietary n-3 VLCUFAs intake increased its deposition at sn-1/3 of triglycerides and at sn-2 of phosphatidylcholines. Irrespective of dietary oil, 16:0 was distributed preferentially at the outer positions of glycerol backbone. High 18:2n-6 accumulated at sn-2 position for fish fed with n-3 PUFA-enriched oils. High 18:3n-3 deposited at sn-1/3 in TG, sn-1 in phosphatidylethanolamines, while at sn-2 in phosphatidylcholines. Together, dietary oils change the composition and positional distribution of fatty acids on the glycerol backbone, and change nutritional value of fish for human health.

AB Spring wheat plants were grown under two CO2 concentrations (380 and 550 mu mol mol(-1)) and two temperature treatments (ambient and post-anthesis heat stress) to investigate the effects of elevated CO2 and heat stress on grain protein quality. Contents of protein components, glutenin macropolymers (GMP) and amino acids in grains decreased due to elevated CO2, while increased by high temperature. The combination of elevated CO2 and heat stress increased the contents of total protein and albumin, but decreased the contents of gliadin and glutenin, while the content and particle size distribution of GMP as well as the contents of amino acids were not significantly affected. Furthermore, we found that the content and particle size distribution of GMP were not only determined by the contents of proteins and high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits, but also related to the contents of amino acids containing disulfide bonds, which favor the formation of large insoluble polymers.

AB Population aging has reinforced the need for production of foods with high nutritional value, especially fresh fruits and vegetables. In general, due to their perishable nature, these foods are prone to spoilage by post-harvest microorganisms. For this reason, I aim to discuss in this article the alternative use of enzymes as biocontrol agents against fungal infections in post-harvest fruits and vegetables. This article therefore proposes a sustainable alternative with demonstrated success to improve the preservation of food in its fresh form and facilitating its storage, mainly in domestic space. Food spoilage caused by microorganisms has adverse economic effects. Pathogens such as Monilinia spp., Botrytis cinerea, and Penicillium expansum are important fungi that cause postharvest spoilage of fruits. Thus, the application of enzymes in food chemistry offers a promising approach to improve the shelf life of foods without altering the organoleptical characteristics and nutritional content.

AB In this study, solid-state fermentation was used to produce Inonotus hispidus melanin (IH melanin). Its physicochemical properties were characterized, and ultrasonic-assisted extraction was used to optimize its extraction process. Characterization techniques like elemental analysis and so on were used to identify melanin. The solubility, stability, and antioxidant activity were also measured. Furthermore, the extraction process of IH melanin was optimized. The results showed that the pigment could be defined as dihydroxy phenylalanine (DOPA)-melanin, it displayed irregular spherical and ellipsoidal structures with average size of 89.33 nm. Melanin has a specific stability and shows antioxidant activity. The optimal extraction parameters of melanin were a NaOH concentration of 0.56 mol/L, solid-liquid ratio of 1:50, ultrasonic power of 300 W, extraction temperature of 70 degrees C, and ultrasonic time of 70 min. This study was the first time that IH melanin was obtained. The results may be applied to health food or food additives.

AB Honey from different provinces of North and Central Mozambique was characterised considering their physicochemical quality parameters, colour, sugars, total antioxidants, pollen analysis and volatile profile. Flora that surrounds the hives, and the apicultural practices also influence in their characteristics. According to a similar pollen spectrum, eight types of honey were found. In these, the predominant pollens were: I-Astragalus type; II-Acanthus sp; III-Celastraceae; IV-Brassicaceae; V-Anacardiaceae and Astragalus type; VI-Astragalus type and Myrtaceae; VII-Asteraceae family and VIII-unknown. Group I (from Nampula), especially distanced itself from the others mainly due to the special abundance of certain compounds (alcohols, aldehydes, esters, acids and terpenes). The presence of furan compounds largely identified in Sofala and Manica honeys could be due to inadequate beekeeping practices or storage conditions. A discriminant analysis correctly classified 96.7% of the groups, being electrical conductivity and moisture followed by the volatile-compound 3-Methylbutan-1-ol and the free acidity, the variables that most contributed.

AB Economically motivated adulteration (EMA) has become one of the most concerned food safety issues. However, existing mainstream PCR methods could neither achieve qualitative detection purposes, nor detect all possible meat species involved in adulteration. When meat has been adulterated with unidentified species but the result indicates no adulteration, it is a false negative; when meat has not been adulterated deliberately but has somehow been polluted during its processing or packaging, a false positive emerges. A novel reference primer based real-time PCR approach was developed in this study for quantitative determination of goat meat adulterated with pork. By calculating the ratio of Ct (specificity/reference), a good linear correlation (R-2 = 0.9929) could be deduced for the goat meat content. We also successfully amplified simulated samples and the results showed high accuracy with an average recovery of 108.74% for the samples.

AB A rectangular waveguide equipped with a network analyzer was used to assess the quality indices of shell egg. The scattering parameters of the eggs were acquired in the range of 0.9-1.7 GHz and they were then used to calculate microwave spectra of the samples. PLS and ANN regression methods were implemented to predict the egg quality indices and SIMCA and ANN classification methods were applied to classify the eggs based on their storage time. The best predictive models, however, obtained from ANN analysis where the yolk coefficient, air cell height, thick albumen height, Haugh unit, and albumen pH could be predicted with the residual predictive deviation (RPD) values of 3.500, 3.000, 2.411, 2.033, and 1.829, respectively. To classify the eggs according to their storage time, both SIMCA and ANN analyses resulted in the total accuracy of 100% when return loss spectra were used as the input.

AB In this study, the microalga Nitzschia laevis (N. laevis) can accumulate a marine carotenoid fucoxanthinol. In particular, fucoxanthinol was firstly isolated from microalgae, accompanied by its derivative fucoxanthin. The identification and quantification of fucoxanthinol and fucoxanthin were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to photodiode array detector-quadrupole/travelling-wave ion mobility mass spectrometry/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-PDA-TWIMS-QTOF-MS). Furthermore, a cost-effective approach mediated with solid-phase extraction (SPE) and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) technique was used to isolate and purify fucoxanthinol and fucoxanthin from the extracts of N. laevis. This two-step method can obtain 98% fucoxanthinol and 95% fucoxanthin, with the recovery efficiencies of around 85% for fucoxanthinol and 70% for fucoxanthin, respectively. Moreover, H-1 and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques were adopted to record the purified compounds for supporting the above results. In all, the developed method has a promising potential to purify fucoxanthinol and fucoxanthin of microalgae for food and pharmaceutical applications.

AB Lutein, abundant in dark leafy vegetables, has been associated with several health promoting effects. Still, to what extent different preparation conditions and practices affect the liberation of lutein from food is not fully understood. Here, we compared a range of domestic methods under realistic conditions to prepare spinach, the most common lutein-rich vegetable. After preparations, samples were processed by in vitro digestion and lutein was quantified by HPLC. Data indicate that short-term and medium-term heating of spinach, independent of heating method, substantially reduced liberated lutein and reduction was most pronounced after long boiling times. Interestingly, the loss of lutein in heated samples was partly compensated when samples were reheated in the microwave. However, the highest yield of liberated lutein was obtained from liquefied spinach. Additional dairy enhanced the liquefaction effect. Thus, for optimal liberation of lutein, liquefaction of raw spinach appears to be the method of choice.

The Fe3O4@GC submicrocubes showed unique architectures where in situ generated thin graphitic carbon layer wrapped on the surface of Fe3O4, resulting in excellent affinity to five phthalate esters (PAEs), good reusability and rapid magnetic separation, therefore were employed as magnetic dispersive solid-phase extraction material combined with HPLC to simultaneously detect five trace PAEs in beverages and plastic bottles. Under optimized conditions, recoveries (80.0%-112.8%), precision (RSDs <= 8.8%), and limits of detection (LODs) for beverages (0.09-0.28 mu g L-1) and plastic bottles (0.01-0.03 mu g g(-1)) were obtained. This work not only establishes an effective method for simultaneous determination of five PAEs, but also opens up a new strategy to design/construct magnetic graphitic carbon-encapsulated core-shell materials using low-cost/recyclable napkins as carbon source.

AB A novel and fast salting out liquid-liquid extraction method was developed for simultaneous determination of food additives with different polarities in juices. Chromatographic separation was achieved in less than 6 min using Acquity UPLC BEH C 18 (100 mm x 2.1 mm d.i. x 1.7 mu m) column with ammonium acetate with 0.01% of trifluoroacetic acid as eluent A and acetonitrile as eluent B at a flow rate of 0.2 mL min(-1). The main factors affecting the extraction efficiency were optimized. The method was validated applying accuracy profile based on total error. The extraction recoveries ranged from 84.97 to 122%. Relative standard deviation ranged from 1.24 to 7.99% for intraday assay and from 1.69 to 9.16% for intermediate precision. The limits of detection for five food additives were from 0.3 to 1.42 mu g mL(-1). The method was successfully applied to 47 samples of juices from nine brands.

AB An immunochromatographic assay (ICA) based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for ultrasensitive determination of Sudan I in food samples was reported. Gold-silver core-shell bimetallic nanorods (referred to as Au@Ag NRs) were synthesized, characterized and used as the substrate for preparation of the ICA. Polyclonal antibody against Sudan I was immobilized on the surface of the Au@Ag NRs carrying the Raman reporter 5,5'-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid). The Raman scattering intensity on the test line was used for quantitation of Sudan I. The assay was completed in 15 min. IC50 and limit of detection (LOD) were 30 pg mL(-1) and 0.2 pg mL(-1), respectively. There was no cross-reactivity (CR) of the assay with Sunset Yellow, Lemon Yellow and Brilliant blue FCF, but only 3.53%-9.74% CR with Sudan II, III and IV. The recoveries of Sudan I from spiked food samples were in the range of 88.9-107.6% with relative standard deviation of 3.7-8.7% (n=3).

AB D-Allulose has been reported to have beneficial health effects. However, the transport system(s) mediating intestinal D-allulose transport has not yet been clearly identified. The aim of this study was to investigate whether intestinal D-allulose transport is mediated by glucose transporter type 5 (GLUT5). When D-allulose alone was gavaged, plasma D-allulose levels were dramatically higher in rats previously fed fructose. This suggests enhanced intestinal D-allulose absorption paralleled increases in GLUT5 expression observed only in fructose-fed rats. When D-allulose was gavaged with D-fructose, previously observed increases in plasma D-allulose levels were dampened and delayed, indicating D-fructose inhibited transepithelial D-allulose transport into plasma. Tracer D[C-14]-fructose uptake rate was reduced to 54.8% in 50mM D-allulose and to 16.4% in 50mM D-fructose, suggesting D-allulose competed with D-[C-14]-fructose and the affinity of D-allulose for GLUT5 was lower than that of D-fructose. GLUT5 clearly mediates, likely at lower affinity relative to D-fructose, intestinal D-allulose transport.

AB Although 3-alkyl-2-methoxypyrazines (MPs) are very important flavor compounds in grape and wine, the metabolic pathway of these compounds has not been fully elucidated, and only a few studies have focused on it to date. In this study, we performed in situ incorporation of the proposed precursor (L-Leu) and the key intermediate (2-amino-4-methylpentanamide; AMPA) of 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (IBMP) biosynthesis into Cabernet Sauvignon clusters. The IBMP content and the expression levels of key related genes were monitored. IBMP content decreased shortly after L-Leu or AMPA treatment, but subsequently increased significantly, with raised levels of O-methyltransferase genes (VvOMT1 and VvOMT3) in the berries between veraison and maturation. We speculate that L-Leu may be a precursor of IBMP biosynthesis and that AMPA may be a key intermediate.

AB Direct analysis in real-time ionization coupled with mass spectrometry (DART-MS) was first applied for the rapid determination of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in foods. Samples of germinated barley and fermented beans containing GABA at different levels were used, and the results were compared with those obtained by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS). After a series of optimization, a simple sample extraction procedure using 30% methanol aqueous solution was conducted, followed by direct determination of sample extracts without chromatographic separation or prior derivatization. The optimized DART-MS method exhibited low limits of detection (0.040 mg.kg(-1)) and good recovery rates (88.6%-104%). The Aspergillus oryzae-fermented black beans produced the highest amount GABA. The results for the samples slightly varied between DART-MS and UHPLC-ESI-MS. Current findings indicate that DART-MS could be a high-throughput alternative to classic UHPLC-ESI-MS.

AB A rapid and fast detection of trace amounts of melamine in milk is reported by using Gold Nano Spheres embedded monolith conjugates. Monolith was synthesized by the polymerization of Glycidyl Methacrylate (GMA) and Ethylene Dimethacrylate (EDMA) (cross linker and functional monomer), Cyclohexanol (Porogen formation) and 2, 2-Dimethoxy-2-phenyl-acetophenone (photo-initiator) on gold coated silicon wafer. In order to gauge the influence of monolith on SERS signal activity, three shapes of gold nanoparticles namely Gold Nano Spheres (GNSs), Gold Nanorods (GNRs) and Triangular Gold Nanoprisms (GNPrs) were immobilized on monolithic surface and analyzed by the signal molecule Rhodamine (R6G). The Raman Enhancement efficiency of the above three shapes incorporated with monolith was monitored by calculating their maximum enhancement factors. Among three morphologies, Gold Nano Spheres integrated in GMA-EDMA Monolith Sensor (GNS@GEMS) was found more effective for detection of R6G than two others and was therefore projected in analysis of melamine sensing in commercial milk. A linear relationship of regression model (R-2 = 0.99) was observed between melamine SERS intensity (at 710 cm(-1)) and varied concentrations (6.5 < mg/L < 0.125). The lower limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for melamine was determined 0.11 mg/L and 0.38 mg/L respectively. The time window for detection of melamine was 10 min and hence our method is compatible with the FDA's tolerance limit in USA and China (1 mg/L).

AB Tea polyphenols (TP) and soybean proteins (SP) are important materials in food industry. High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) is a useful tool for improvement of protein's function. This study evaluated the interactions between the polyphenol and HHP-treated protein using circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular modeling. The high pressure at 400 MPa significantly modified the secondary structure of SP by increasing the beta-sheet content and decreasing the alpha-helix content, while the addition of 0.1% (w/v) tea ployphenol appeared to protect the alpha-helix structure. The surface hydrophobicity decreased with HHP treatment and the addition of TP. The optimal solubility of native SP was 0.258 g/mL at 0.08% (w/v) TP. Together with HHP treatment; TP increased the protein solubility to 0.50 g/mL and the emulsifying activity was enhanced approximately three times, up to 43.5%. The micro-texture of SP matrix was also improved with TP and HHP treatment. Both the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction between TP and SP were elucidated using docking method. Apart from the hydrogen bonding, the Pi-Pi interaction was observed in the binding of phenolic compounds to 7S or 11S globular protein.

AB Molecular imprinting is a technique for polymerization using a template molecule to produce cavities in the polymer with high selectivity. The successful synthesis of a dual-function molecularly-imprinted optopolymer (MIOP) based on quantum dots-grafted covalent-organic frameworks as adsorbents has allowed the simultaneous detection of tyramine by optosensing and solid-phase extraction coupled with high performance liquid chromatography (SPE-HPLC). The MIOP, obtained by a one-pot reverse microemulsion polymerization, selectively measured tyramine from fermented meat products. Under optimized conditions, the relative fluorescence intensity of the optosensing method increased linearly at tyramine concentrations from 35 to 35,000 mu g/kg, with a detection limit of 7.0 mu g/kg. For SPE-HPLC, the linear range was from 20 to 2000 mu g/kg, with a detection limit of 5 mu g/kg. The optosensing based on MIOP is a rapid and selective method that would be suitable for detecting TYM in food, while SPE-HPLC also provided good levels of accuracy, sensitivity, and selectivity.

AB Since high-temperature cooking (> 95 degrees C) deteriorates duck meat quality, a lower temperature (70 degrees C) with high-pressure (400 MPa) were investigated. Duck breast was subjected to salting/pickling treatment prior to heating-alone (70 degrees C) or HPP with heating (P + H) for 10 or 20 min. These were compared with a Cooked-control (80 degrees C at 0.1 MPa). Compared with Control, the P + H method resulted in improved meat color (p < 0.05). Low-field NMR indicated that P + H contributed to protonation due to inward shift of proton equilibrium. Moreover, P + H significantly decreased MDA equivalents (TBARS) and carbonyl contents, but increased sulfhydryl contents. The protonation under P + H produced an antioxidant-like effect due to strengthening of H-bonds and recycling of thiols. PCA revealed that changes in proton relaxation of P + H samples affected extents of lipid and protein oxidation, hence influenced product color and texture. This P + H method exhibited potential as a minimal thermal processing method for duck meat, with enhanced product quality and safety.

AB The low solubility of wheat gluten (WG) considerably limits its application. Owing to its high hydrolytic efficiency, alcalase was the protease selected for the enzymatic hydrolysis of WG. The functional properties of WG hydrolysate prepared by alcalase (AHWG) with a hydrolysis degree (DH) of 10% were better than those with DH 5% and DH 15%. The application of AHWG was hindered by its bitterness. To mask the bitterness of AHWG, WG was respectively deamidated with acetic acid, tartaric acid, and citric acid, followed by being hydrolyzed by alcalase to DH 10%. The citric acid deamidation-alcalase hydrolysis WG hydrolysate (CDAH) exhibited the best functional properties. Partial least squares regression analysis results indicated that CDAH exhibited an enhanced bitter-masking property attributable to a high content of umami taste amino acids (glutamic acid and aspartic acid). Thus, CDAH showed the greatest potential as a modified WG product to expand the application of WG.

AB Gluten-free bread was fortified with modified dietary fibers (wheat bran, resistant starch and inulin) and their effects on water mobility, friction coefficient, thermal behavior, crystalline pattern and textural properties were evaluated. Moreover, time-intensity evaluation was used to study temporal dynamics of sensory attributes of fortified-breads. Dietary fibers increased gelatinization temperature while decreasing gelatinization enthalpy, more notably when inulin was used. X-ray diffraction patterns of bread showed the appearance of new peaks after addition of resistant starch and wheat bran, coinciding with an increase in crumb hardness. In contrast, inulin considerably decreased starch crystallinity in the bread, resulting in a softer crumb. Faster decay and shifting of protons to shorter times were found with incorporation of dietary fibers. Friction coefficient determined by tribology measurement was higher in the breads containing resistant starch and wheat bran compared to other samples. Pearson's correlation analysis indicated the sensory attributes of firmness, chewiness and dryness were positively correlated with instrumental findings. Time-intensity evaluation revealed inulin-fortified bread had the lowest firmness and chewiness with less dryness, whereas resistant starch-fortified bread showed the highest intensity of these descriptors.

AB In this study, the capacity of asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) coupled with multiangle light scattering (MALS) and differential refractive index (dRI) detectors, to monitor starch retrogradation behavior in situ was evaluated. Meanwhile, the starch samples were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The effect of the botanical origin, amylose/amylopectin ratio, storage conditions (i.e., temperature and time), and salt on starch retrogradation was systematically investigated. The starch aggregation and disassociation is a kinetic equilibrium process that is dependent on the storage conditions and the content of amylose. Moreover, it was found that nitrate ions retarded starch retrogradation behavior by inhibiting the formation of hydrogen bonds between amylose molecules. The results suggest that the formation of the small amylose aggregates plays an important role in starch retrogradation and maize amylopectin degradation. The information obtained by AF4-MALS-dRI is valuable for understanding the starch retrogradation mechanism.

AB Avenanthramides are amides, with a phenylalkenoic acid (PA) and an anthranilic acid (AA) subunit, which are secondary metabolites of oat. Oat seeds were germinated, extracted, and the avenanthramides analysed by a combination of UHPLC with ion trap and high resolution ESI-MS. Typical fragmentation pathways with corresponding diagnostic fragments belonging to the PA and AA subunits were identified and summarised in a decision guideline. Based on these findings 28 unique avenanthramides were annotated in the oat seed(ling) extracts, including the new avenanthramide 6f (with a 4/5-methoxy AA subunit). Avenanthramide content increased by 25 times from seed to seedling. Avenanthramides 2p, 2c, and 2f, which are commonly described as the major avenanthramides, represented less than 20% of the total content in the seedlings. Future quantitative analyses should, therefore, include a wider range of avenanthramides to avoid underestimation of the total avenanthramide content.

AB Phenolic compounds are very important in crop plants, particularly in grapes. The different strategies to increase their levels include the use of elicitors such as methyl jasmonate (MeJ) and benzothiadiazole (BTH). In an attempt to improve the quality of wines, our aim was to evaluate the effect of preharvest application of these elicitors on the composition and structure of the skin cell walls of Monastrell, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, and to ascertain any relationship with the extractability of phenolic compounds during winemaking. The results indicated that the exogenous application of MeJ and BTH during veraison caused significant changes in several components of the skin cell walls, such as phenolic compounds, proteins and structural sugars. However these changes manifested themselves in different proportions in each variety and year, pointing to the varietal and meteorological dependence of the response to the application of these elicitors. The treatments delayed the maturation process in all varieties when rainfall was low. This observation, together with the observed increase in proteins and phenols in the skin cell wall of Monastrell and Cabernet Sauvignon, could contribute to the strength necessary to maintain the integrity of berries and to increasing resistance to fungal pathogens as the phenolic compounds evolve, thus improving the phenolic profile. However, the structural integrity of Merlot variety tended to decrease in the same conditions.

AB In this study, we compared the antioxidant activity of ripe and unripe acerola extracts with synthetic antioxidants (BHA and BHT). This activity was assessed by classical approaches (DPPH and ABTS) and by an in vivo method using yeasts. Acerola extracts contain phenolic compounds and ascorbic acid that exhibit radical scavenger capacity and reducing power. The results obtained with yeasts revealed that the acerola extracts and BHT either acted as antioxidants or presented no activity depending on the nature of the oxidant molecule used. BHA decreased yeast resistance to oxidative treatments and also showed deleterious effects even when oxidative treatments were not applied. The unripe acerola was the most efficient antioxidant in the in vitro experiments but not necessarily in the in vivo assays, showing the weakness of in vitro systems in predicting antioxidant responses for biological purposes.

AB The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action of flavonoids in lotus plumule were systematically analyzed using radical scavenging assays and ELISA kits. By this means, flavonoids displayed significant antioxidant activity by donating electron, H atom as well as capturing DPPH and ABTS(+) free radicals, and anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the production of the inflammatory mediators (NO radicals, PGE(2) and TNF-alpha) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta and IL-6). Meanwhile, the bioactive components against inflammation targeting COX-2 were also revealed using ultrafiltration coupled to LC-MS (UF-LC/MS). In this way, 12 components showing specific binding to COX-2 were screened out and identified. The structure-activity relationships suggested that flavonoids O-glycosides displayed comparable binding affinities to COX-2 compared with flavonoids C-glycosides and could be considered as the main active components. This study will provide valuable information for the further exploration of lotus plumule as functional foods or in pharmaceutical industries in the near future.

AB Nuts are highly appreciated due to their nutritional relevance and flavour, being the source of many desirable and healthy compounds as polyunsaturated fatty acids and antioxidants. Their characterization became the target of many studies in the last years through conventional analytical techniques as chromatographic ones. Due to the limitations associated to these techniques, as time, cost and environmental concerns, spectroscopic techniques have been increasingly pointed as reliable alternatives. Either applied to raw materials quality control or to more complex process, as industrial in-line monitoring, spectroscopic techniques, namely vibrational spectroscopy, are gathering strong acceptance. This paper presents a review on the application of vibrational spectroscopy, infrared and Raman, to nuts characterization. Estimates of several qualitative and quantitative parameters, origin authentication and/or adulteration in almonds, peanuts, pine nuts, hazelnuts, walnuts, Brazil nuts, cashews, chestnuts and pistachios will be covered. Advantages and limitations of these techniques and future trends will also be discussed.

AB Colored-grain wheat genotypes were used in the preparation of flour, dough, buns, and buns stored for a short period of time. The main carotenoid in all genotypes was lutein, followed by its esters, zeaxanthin, and beta-carotene, while antheraxanthin and alpha-carotene occurred only at negligible levels. The highest carotenoid contents were observed in Yellow- and purple-grained genotypes. After the preparation of dough, total carotenoid content (TCC) decreased significantly by an average of 61.5%. Zeaxanthin was shown to be stable, whereas alpha-carotene was destroyed. In baked buns, the average decrease of TCC and all-E-lutein was lower than in unbaked dough. Greater decreases were recorded for esters, antheraxanthin, and beta-carotene. After storing buns for 24 h at room temperature, approximately one-quarter of TCC observed in the original flour was preserved. Z-Isomers of lutein occurred in minor concentrations, but the degradation of this component, and that of zeaxanthin, was low, suggesting E- to Z-isomerization.

AB Post-fermented tea (dark tea) is produced from enzyme-inactivated fresh tea leaves by microbial fermentation. Batabata tea and Awaban tea are two major dark teas fermented under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. However, how their chemical compositions and functionalities change during different post-fermentation processes remains unclear. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based analyses showed that (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and (-)-epicatechin (EC) decreased in Batabata tea during post-fermentation with aerobic molds. In contrast, EGC and EC increased, and pyrogallol was produced in Awaban tea during post-fermentation with lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The anti-glycation activities of two dark teas were investigated using an in vitro assay system with human serum albumin (HSA). The anti-glycation activity decreased in Batabata tea, but it was retained in Awaban tea during post-fermentation. Our results showed that post-fermentation with LAB was an efficient way to enhance phenol content and that pyrogallol contributed to anti-glycation activity of Awaban tea.

AB This study investigated an efficient and recyclable approach for purification of crude pumpkin oligosaccharide (POS) by macroporous resins. Five resins with different physical and chemical properties were tested for decoloration of POS. In virtue of its higher decoloration ratio (92.6%) and POS recovery ratio (81.3%), the macroporous resin DM28 was considered to a better selection. Depending on the changes of molecular weight, part of the monosaccharides in crude POS were removed simultaneously after decoloration by DM28. Operating conditions were also determined by the dynamic breakthrough and desorption curves. Moreover, UV/vis spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared results revealed that most of the colored impurities and proteins can be removed, but the characteristic groups of the POS exhibited no significant difference. Compared with traditional methods, DM28 resin is superior in decoloration efficiency, pigment recovery and oligosaccharide recovery. This research contributes to further exploration on the structure and function of POS.

AB The influence of grape maturity on wine volatome was investigated using HS-SPME-GC x GC-TOFMS. Shiraz wines were made from grapes harvested from four different vineyards from two berry maturity levels. A total of 1276 putative compounds were detected in at least one of the wine samples and 175 showed significant trends related to grape maturity. The first two dimensions of the Principal component analysis accounted for 57% of the variation and separated the samples according to the harvest date. Wines from the first harvest date were characterised by an abundance of lipoxygenase derived compounds, norisoprenoids and sulfur-containing compounds whereas a significant increase in some acetate esters was observed in wines produced from the more mature grapes.
   This study demonstrated a common evolution of grape volatiles for Shiraz inside the same mesoclimate. During the late ripening stage of the grape, a direct nexus between sugar concentration and wine volatile evolution was not observed.

The current research characterises 18 laboratory produced and 15 commercial apple recovery aroma samples, establishes a database of delta C-13 values of 16 aroma compounds with respect to their origin (synthetic and natural), and assesses the authenticity of commercially available aroma compounds. Analysis of so-called natural aroma products, revealed delta C-13 values that were within the expected authentic range although the data did reveal possible falsifications. The sensitivity of the method was evaluated through simple isotope mass balance calculation. Falsification identification is possible for most aromatic substances when the amount of added synthetic compound is in tens of percent.

AB After treatment of an inpatient with measles, an outbreak occurred within the unprotected healthcare workers (HCW) of a regional hospital in Hesse, Germany in February and March 2017. Overall, 10 HCW contracted measles. Remarkably, none of the affected HCW had direct contact to the index patient. One nosocomial transmission to a patient occurred. The economic impact of the outbreak is estimated to approximately 700,000(sic).
   Medical institutions play a major role in the management of measles outbreaks, since the risk of exposure as well as nosocomial transmission to vulnerable patients and HCW is very high. To avoid outbreaks it is essential to have an easily accessible documentation of the immune-status of all HCW. The role of occupational medicine in identifying and closing vaccination gaps is of particular importance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Antenatal influenza vaccination (AIV) is an effective intervention for protecting pregnant women and their newborns against influenza. Although the World Health Organization recommends AIV at any stage of pregnancy, in low- and middle-income countries, including India, it is rarely provided. Research suggests that antenatal care (ANC) provider practices explain much of this limited coverage. Our study in urban Pune, India, assessed the feasibility of a two-stage clinician-engagement strategy to reduce missed opportunities for AIV in urban private-practice ANC clinics.
   Methods: Clinicians were randomized to intervention and control groups in slum and middle-class study sites. Intervention-group clinicians (active clinicians) were assessed on vaccination-related views and practices, and were presented with authoritative AIV recommendations from global, academic and professional medical organizations. In a second meeting after a community survey, findings concerning vaccination-related views and experiences were explained to active clinicians. Assessments of community vaccination views were not provided to control-group clinicians. Both groups maintained logs of ANC clinic visit vaccination status throughout the 11-month study period to enable identification of missed and taken opportunities for vaccination. Analyses were restricted to visits of women in their third trimester without previous AIV in the current pregnancy.
   Results: Overall, 30 clinicians participated. After first and second interactions, active clinicians in middleclass communities vaccinated at 12.2% and 37.8%, respectively. Middle-class control clinicians vaccinated at <0.2% throughout the study. This difference in AIV taken opportunities between middle-class active and control clinics was statistically significant (p < 0.05) after first and second interactions. In slum-community sites, active clinicians' AIV activity was minimal throughout.
   Conclusions: Our approach for engaging clinicians effectively reduced missed opportunities for AIV in urban middle-class settings of Pune. It may also improve maternal vaccination for other conditions. The absence of any similar effect in slum-based clinics likely reflects critical limitations of vaccine access. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cocktail vaccines are proposed as an attractive way to increase protection efficacy against specific tick species. Furthermore, such vaccines made with different tick antigens have the potential of cross-protecting against a broad range of tick species. However, there are still limitations to the selection of immunogen candidates. Acknowledging that glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) have been exploited as vaccines against ticks and other parasites, this study aimed to analyze a GST-cocktail vaccine as a potential broad-spectrum tick vaccine. To constitute the GST-cocktail vaccine, five tick species of economic importance for livestock industry were studied (Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, Rhipicephalus decoloratus, Rhipicephalus microplus, Amblyomma variegatum, and Haemaphysalis longicornis). Tick GST ORF sequences were cloned, and the recombinant GSTs were produced in Escherichia coli. rGSTs were purified and inoculated into rabbits, and the immunological response was characterized. The humoral response against rGST-Rd and rGST-Av showed a stronger cross-reactivity against heterologous rGSTs compared to rGST-HI, rGST-Ra, and rGST-Rm. Therefore, rGST-Rd and rGST-Av were selected for constituting an experimental rGST-cocktail vaccine. Vaccination experiment in rabbits showed that rGST-cocktail caused 35% reduction in female numbers in a Rhipicephalus sanguineus infestation. This study brings forward an approach to selecting immunogens for cocktail vaccines, and the results highlight rGST-Rd and rGST-Av as potentially useful tools for the development of a broad-spectrum tick vaccine.

AB Porcine Circovirus Type 2 (PCV2) is one of the most important pathogens in pigs around the world. PCV2 is a non-enveloped virus and its capsid is formed by a single protein known as open reading frame 2 (ORF2). The aim of this study was to evaluate the antigenicity and immunogenicity of genetically-encoded protein nanoparticles (NPs) containing ORF2 from PCV2 fused to the first 110 amino acids of the N-terminus of polyhedrin from the insect virus Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (PH (1 -1 1 0)). Our group has previously described that some polyhedrin fragments self-aggregate forming polyhedra-like particles. We identified a self-aggregating signal within the first 110 amino acids from polyhedrin (PH(1 -1 1 0)). Fusing the ORF2 from PCV2 to the carboxyl terminus from PH(1 -1 1 0) results in the formation of NPs which incorporate the antigen of interest. Using this system we synthesized NPs containing PH(1 -1 1 0) fused to ORF2 (PH(1 -1 1 0)PCV2) and purify them to immunize pigs and evaluate the humoral immune response generated by these NPs comparing them to a commercially available vaccine. Pigs immunized with PH(1 -1 1 0)PCV2 NPs produced antibodies against ORF2 from PCV2 as indicated by western blot and ELISA analysis. Antibodies obtained with PH(1 -1 1 0)PCV2 NPs were comparable to those obtained using a commercial PCV2 vaccine. These antibodies neutralized the infection of a recombinant PCV2 expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP). These results together suggest that the self-aggregating peptide PH(1 -1 1 0) can be used for the synthesis of subunit vaccines against PCV2. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Despite minimal evidence, public concerns that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine can cause autoimmune diseases (AD) persist. We evaluated whether HPV vaccine is associated with a long-term increased risk of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1).
   Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study in which we identified all potential DM1 cases from Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) members who were between 11 and 26 years old any time after June 2006 through December 2015. We chart reviewed a random sample of 100 DM1 cases to confirm diagnosis and to develop a computer algorithm that reliably determined symptom onset date. Our DM1 Analysis Population comprised all individuals who met membership criteria and who were age and sex eligible to have received HPV vaccine. We adjusted for age, sex, race, Medicaid, and years of prior KPNC membership by stratification using a Cox multiplicative hazards model with a calendar timeline.
   Results: Our DM1 analysis included 911,648 individuals. Of 2613 DM1 cases identified, 338 remained in the analysis after applying our algorithm, HPV vaccine eligibility and membership criteria. Over the 10 years of the study period, comparing vaccinated with unvaccinated persons, we did not find an increased risk of DM1 associated with HPV vaccine receipt (hazard ratio 1.21, 95% Confidence Interval 0.94, 1.57).
   Conclusions: We found no increased risk for development of DM1 following HPV vaccination. Our study provides reassurance that during the 10-year time period after HPV vaccine was introduced, there was no substantial increased risk for DM1 following HPV vaccination.

AB Subunit vaccines generally require adjuvants to achieve optimal immune responses. Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists are promising immune potentiators, but rapid diffusion from the injection site reduces their local effective concentration and may cause systemic reactions. In this study, we investigated the potential of aluminum hydroxide adjuvant (AH) to adsorb the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C) and TLR9 agonist CpG and compared the effect of the combination adjuvant on the immune response with either the TLR agonists or AH alone in mice. Poly(I:C) and CpG readily adsorbed onto AH and this combination adjuvant induced a stronger IgG1 and IgG2a immune response with a significant increase of antibody avidity. The combination adjuvant enhanced antigen uptake and activation of dendritic cells in vitro. It induced an inflammatory response at the injection site similar to AH but without eosinophils which are typically observed with AH. A distinctive antigen-containing monocyte/macrophage population with an intermediate level of CD11c expression was identified in the draining lymph nodes after immunization with TLR agonists and the combination adjuvant. Injection of the combination adjuvant did not induce an increase of TNF alpha and CXCL10 in serum in contrast to the injection of soluble TLR agonists. These results indicate that this combination adjuvant is a promising formulation to solve some of the unmet needs of current vaccines. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: In recent years, pediatric immunization rates in Italy have decreased well below the recommended thresholds, largely due to an increase in scepticism about the efficacy and safety of vaccines. We aimed to identify the degree of such scepticism, and the factors driving it, among a sample of pregnant women in the City of Rome.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey on a sample of pregnant women attending antenatal classes (CANs) in Rome through distribution of a self-administered questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression models were built to analyze the determinants of knowledge, attitudes and intention to vaccinate in this population.
   Results: A total of 458 pregnant women attending CANs in 36 family health centers and two hospitals in Rome answered the survey. Mean age was 32.9 (+/- 5.0) years, and over 90% of women were in their first pregnancy. More than 26% of respondents showed a good level of knowledge of the safety and efficacy of vaccines, but there were high rates of uncertainty or agreement with some of the most common antivaccination sentiments. Only 75% of women were sure about vaccinating their children with the hexavalent vaccine, and 64.3% with MMR. A good level of knowledge was the strongest predictor of positive attitudes towards vaccination (OR 11.61, 95% CI 6.43-20.96), which, in turn, influenced the intention to vaccinate for most vaccines with the perception of the benefit of immunization for protection against disease.
   Conclusions: Scepticism about the safety, efficacy and importance of vaccines is associated to pregnant women's hesitancy to vaccinate their children, suggesting the need to develop strategies to increase vaccine acceptance in the antenatal period. The capacity of health care professionals, particularly midwives, to correctly deliver information to future parents should be strengthened in order to reduce the spread of misinformation and fear of vaccine safety.

ID PARALYTIC POLIOMYELITIS; SABIN STRAINS
AB In Japan, the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) was changed to 2 types of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), the standalone conventional IPV (cIPV) and the Sabin-derived IPV combined with diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP-sIPV), for routine immunization in 2012. We evaluated polio vaccination coverage and the seroprevalence of poliovirus antibodies using data from the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (NESVPD) from 2011 to 2015. Several years before the introduction of IPV in 2012, OPV administration for children was refused by some parents because of concerns about the risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis. Consequently, in children aged <1 years who were surveyed in 2011-2012, polio vaccination coverage (45.0-48.8%) and seropositivity rates for poliovirus (type 1: 51.7-65.9%, type 2: 48.3-53.7%, and type 3: 15.0-29.3%) were decreased compared to those surveyed in 2009. However, after IPV introduction, the vaccination coverage (95.5-100%) and seropositivity rates (type 1: 93.2-96.6%, type 2: 93.1-100%, and type 3: 88.6-93.9%) increased among children aged <1 years in 2013-2015. In particular, seropositivity rates and geometric mean titers (GMTs) for poliovirus type 3 in <5-year-old children who received 4 doses of IPV (98.5% and 247.4, respectively) were significantly higher than in those who received 2 doses of OPV (72.5% and 22.9, respectively). Furthermore, in <5-year-old children who received 4 doses of either DTaP-sIPV or cIPV, the seropositivity rates and the GMTs for all 3 types of poliovirus were similarly high (96.5-100% and 170.3-368.8, respectively). Our findings from the NESVPD demonstrate that both the vaccination coverage and seropositivity rates for polio remained high in children after IPV introduction. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

   DIPHTHERIA; TETANUS; COVERAGE; INFANTS
AB Background: Infants younger than 6 months are at increased risk of complications and mortality from pertussis infection. In October 2012, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices revised its recommendation to include a Tdap dose during each pregnancy, ideally between 27 and 36 weeks gestation.
   Objective: Assess trends in Tdap vaccination coverage among privately insured pregnant women from 2009 to 2016 including timing of Tdap vaccination (before, during, or after pregnancy), trimester of vaccination for women vaccinated during pregnancy, and missed vaccination opportunities for unvaccinated women. Identify factors associated with vaccination during the optimal period of 27-36 weeks gestation.
   Study design: Retrospective analysis of privately insured women 15-49 years who delivered live births during 2009-2016 conducted using 2009-2016 MarketScan data. Tdap vaccination coverage and the timing of Tdap vaccine administration were assessed for women continuously enrolled from 6 months before pregnancy to 1 month after delivery. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors independently associated with receipt of Tdap vaccine at 27-36 weeks gestation.
   Results: Tdap vaccination coverage during pregnancy increased from 0.4% in 2009 to 6.2% in 2012 and to 53.2% in 2016. The proportion of vaccinated women receiving Tdap at 27-36 weeks gestation increased from <10% in 2009 to nearly 90% in 2016, with most vaccination occurring at 27-32 weeks gestation. Women of older age, residing in a metropolitan statistical area, residing outside the South, and having a capitated health insurance plan were more likely to receive Tdap at 27-36 weeks gestation than their counterparts. Among women not vaccinated during pregnancy, 77.7% had a pregnancy-related medical claim between 27 and 36 weeks gestation.
   Conclusion: Tdap vaccination coverage during pregnancy increased significantly from 2009 to 2016, with the greatest increase occurring after the revised Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendation. Most women who did not receive Tdap vaccine had a missed vaccination opportunity during pregnancy, indicating potential for much higher vaccination coverage and consequent infant protection against pertussis.

AB Background: There is no licensed vaccine against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), a major cause of diarrhea-associated morbidity and mortality among infants and children in low-income countries and travelers. The results of this vaccination/challenge study demonstrate strong protection by an attenuated ETEC vaccine candidate, ACE527, when co-administered with a mucosal adjuvant, the double-mutant heat-labile toxin (dmLT) of ETEC.
   Methods: Sixty healthy adults participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study with three doses of lyophilized ACE527 (similar to 3 x 10(9 )of each strain per dose) administered orally with or without dmLT adjuvant (25 mu g/dose). Six months later, 36 of these volunteers and a control group of 21 unvaccinated volunteers were challenged with virulent ETEC strain H10407. The primary outcome was severe diarrhea, defined as passing >800 g of unformed stools during the inpatient period following challenge.
   Findings: The vaccine was well tolerated and induced robust immune responses to key antigens. The protective efficacy (PE) against the primary outcome of severe diarrhea was 65.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.4-87.7, p = 0.003). Among subjects receiving the adjuvanted vaccine, the attack rate of severe diarrhea was 23.1, while in unimmunized controls it was 67.7%. The PE against diarrhea of any severity was 58.5% (95% CI 3.8- 82.1, p = 0.016). There was a strong inverse correlation between shedding of the vaccine strain after either of the first two doses and absence of severe diarrhea upon challenge (RR = 0.29, 95% CI 0.08-1.05, p = 0.041). Challenge strain shedding was 10-fold lower in those receiving the adjuvant than in those receiving vaccine alone. The unadjuvanted vaccine was not protective (PE = 23.1%).
   Interpretation: The results of this study support further development of ACE527 + dmLT as a vaccine for children in endemic countries and travelers. This is the first clinical demonstration that dmLT can contribute significantly to vaccine efficacy and may warrant testing with other oral vaccines. (C) 2019 The Authors.

TI Bias of influenza vaccine effectiveness estimates from test-negative
   studies conducted during an influenza pandemic

DT Article
DE Influenza; Test-negative; Pandemic; Vaccine effectiveness; Bias
ID DESIGN; VIRUS
AB Test-negative (TN) studies have become the most widely used study design for the estimation of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) and are easily incorporated into existing influenza surveillance networks. We seek to determine the bias of TN-based VE estimates during a pandemic using a dynamic probability model. The model is used to evaluate and compare the bias of VE estimates under various sources of bias when vaccination occurs after the beginning of an outbreak, such as during a pandemic. The model includes two covariates (health status and health awareness), which may affect the probabilities of vaccination, developing influenza and non-influenza acute respiratory illness (ARI), and seeking medical care. Specifically, we evaluate the bias of VE estimates when (1) vaccination affects the probability of developing a non-influenza ARI; (2) vaccination affects the probability of seeking medical care; (3) a covariate (e.g. health status) is related to both the probabilities of vaccination and developing an ARI; and (4) a covariate (e.g. health awareness) is related to both the probabilities of vaccination and of seeking medical care. We considered two outcomes against which the vaccine is supposed to protect: symptomatic influenza and medically-attended influenza.
   When vaccination begins during an outbreak, we found that the effect of delayed onset of vaccination is unpredictable. VE estimates from TN studies were biased regardless of the source of bias present. However, if the core assumption of the TN design is satisfied, that is, if vaccination does not affect the probability of non-influenza ARI, then TN-based VE estimates against medically-attended influenza will only suffer from small (<0.05) to moderate bias (>= 0.05 and <0.10). These results suggest that if sources of bias listed above are ruled out, TN studies are a valid study design for the estimation of VE during a pandemic. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Methods: The study was a randomized, double-blind, controlled phase I trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an intranasal vaccine containing the trivalent influenza HA antigen (7.5 mu g each of A/California/7/09 (H1N1)-like virus, A/Victoria/210/2009 (H3N2) virus, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus) in combination with 4 different doses of adjuvant LTh(alpha K) (7.5, 15, 30 or 45 mu g) and 22.5 mu of influenza HA antigen alone (control vaccine). The vaccine was intranasally administered on Days 0 and 7. A safety evaluation commenced for 180 days, and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers and nasal HA-specific IgA titers on Day 0 and Day 28 were assessed to determine whether an immunogenic response was elicited.
   Results: From November 2012 to September 2013, a total of 36 subjects were enrolled. Twenty-four subjects received an adjuvanted vaccine, and 12 subjects received a control vaccine. The most common adverse event (AE) was mild nasal discomfort, and systemic AEs were mild fatigue and headache. Only two subjects discontinued the study because of an AE (one had grade 3 fever, and one had nodal arrhythmia). In the group with 45 mu g of LTh(alpha K), the seroprotection rates were 100%, 100% and 80%, and the nasal IgA conversion factors were 7.90, 7.46 and 12.27 for the A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and split B strains, respectively. Adjuvant LTh(alpha K) vaccine showed a significant enhancement in mucosal immunity in split B -specific IgA.
   Conclusion: The intranasal inactivated influenza vaccine is generally safe, and the LTh(alpha K)-adjuvanted vaccine is more immunogenic than non-adjuvanted control vaccine. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ZOSTER SUBUNIT VACCINE; SAFETY; EFFICACY; TRIAL; EXPRESSION; RESPONSES
AB Background: Adjuvants like AS01(B) increase the immunogenicity of vaccines and generally cause increased transient reactogenicity compared with Alum. A phase H randomized trial was conducted to characterize the response to AS01(B) and Alum adjuvanted vaccines. A post-hoc analysis was performed to examine the associations between reactogenicity and innate immune parameters.
   Methods: The trial involved 60 hepatitis 13-naive adults aged 18-45 years randomized 1:1 to receive either two doses of HBsAg-AS01(B) on Day (D)0 and D30, or three doses of HBsAg-Alum on D0, D30, D180. Prior to vaccination, all subjects received placebo injection in order to differentiate the impact of injection process and the vaccination. Main outcomes included reactogenicity symptoms, vital signs, blood cytokines, biochemical and hematological parameters after vaccination. Associations were explored using linear regression.
   Findings: The vaccine with AS01(B) induced higher HBsAg-specific antibody levels than Alum. Local and systemic symptoms were more frequent in individuals who received HBsAg AS01(B)/Alum vaccine or placebo, but were mild and short-lived. Blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), bilirubin, leukocyte, monocyte and neutrophil counts increased rapidly and transiently after AS01(B) but not after Alum or placebo. Lymphocyte counts decreased in the AS01(B) group and lactate dehydrogenase levels decreased after Alum. Modelling revealed associations between systemic symptoms and increased levels of CRP and IL-6 after the first HBsAg-AS01(B) or HBsAg-Alum immunization. Following the second vaccine dose, CRP, IL-6, IP-10, IFN-gamma, MIP-1 beta and MCP-2 were identified as key parameters associated with systemic symptoms. These observations were confirmed using an independent data set extracted from a previous study of the immune response to HBsAg-adjuvanted vaccines (NCT00805389).
   Conclusions: IL-6 and IFN-gamma signals were associated with systemic reactogenicity following administration of AS01(B)-adjuvanted vaccine. These signals were similar to those previously associated with antibody and T-cell responses induced by HBsAg-adjuvanted vaccines, suggesting that similar innate immune signals may underlie adjuvant reactogenicity and immunogenicity.

AB Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is the etiological agent of a highly contagious disease that affects cloven-hoofed animal species. The FMDV capsid is highly acid labile and viral particles lose their immunogenicity when they disassemble at mildly acidic pHs. The viral capsid of FMDV serotype O is more sensitive than those of other serotypes, making it more difficult to acquire enough emptycapsid-like particles in the acidic insect cell environment for research. In this study, novel FMDV mutants with increased acid resistance were isolated using BHK-21 cell cultured under low-pH conditions. Amino acid substitutions Q25R, K41E, and N85A in the VP1 capsid protein and K154Q in the VP3 capsid protein were detected in all six mutants. Based on these amino acid replacements, empty-capsid-like particles of FMDV serotype O, which were resistant to the acid-induced dissociation of the capsid into pentameric subunits, were produced in insect cells. We characterized the protective immunity induced by these acid-resistant empty capsid particles. Significant humoral and cellular immune responses were elicited in mice after immunization with the acid-resistant empty capsid particles. The acid-resistant emptycapsid-like particles also induced strong neutralizing antibodies in guinea pigs and protected all the guinea pigs from FMDV challenge. Our results suggest that these acid-resistant empty-capsid-like particles have potential utility as a vaccine against serotype O FMDV infection. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   COVERAGE; IMMUNIZATION; DISPARITIES; STRATEGIES; CHILDREN
AB Background: Changing pneumococcal disease epidemiology due to childhood vaccination has prompted re-examination of US adult pneumococcal vaccination policies, as have considerations of greater pneumococcal disease incidence and higher prevalence of conditions that increase risk in underserved minority populations. Prior analyses suggest routine pneumococcal vaccination at age 50 could be considered, which could disproportionately benefit underserved populations.
   Methods: A Markov cohort model estimated the cost-effectiveness of US pneumococcal vaccination policies in hypothetical 50-year-old underserved minority and general population cohorts. Strategies included receiving one or both available pneumococcal vaccines based on age- or chronic condition-specific criteria. US databases and medical literature data calibrated pneumococcal illness incidence, vaccine serotype distributions, age- and race-specific chronic condition distributions, and costs. Black population data were used as a proxy for underserved minorities. We took a US healthcare perspective, discounting at 3%/year. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed and scenarios modeling differing vaccine assumptions were examined.
   Results: In both black and general population 50-year-olds, giving both pneumococcal vaccines to all 50-year-olds prevented the most disease, but cost >$250,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Current CDC recommendations (both vaccines for the immunocompromised, polysaccharide vaccine for other high-risk conditions) were economically favorable in either population when analyses assumed polysaccharide vaccine was ineffective against nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (NBP). If polysaccharide vaccine is effective against NBP or if less complex age-based vaccination recommendations result in increased vaccine uptake, giving polysaccharide vaccine to all 50-year-olds cost < $100,000/QALY; this effect was more pronounced in black cohorts. Results were robust in 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
   Conclusions: Despite changes in pneumococcal epidemiology, current CDC recommendations were favored in underserved minority and general population cohorts. Polysaccharide vaccine for all 50-year-olds could be considered under some vaccine uptake and effectiveness assumptions, particularly if mitigating racial health disparities in pneumococcal disease is a priority.

   Self-Reliance; AVSSR Vaccine; Shortage of vaccine; ASEAN Post-2015

AB The concept of ASEAN Vaccine Security and Self-Reliance (AVSSR) has recently been advocated for by the National Vaccine Institute (NVI), a public organization of Thailand, through two workshops in 2014 and 2015 organized in cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO) for the ASEAN Collaboration Initiatives for Regional Vaccine Security and Self-Reliance (VSSR). In both workshops relevant policy makers, Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) managers, and experts from government and partner agencies involved in the vaccine life cycle actively participated. A paradigm shift in leveraging the initiatives of VSSR from national to regional levels was noted and reiterated.
   The first workshop's objective was to understand the perspectives and identify the needs of ASEAN countries regarding vaccine security, and to list potential areas for further collaboration. The existing vaccine-related capacities, collaborations, and networks in ASEAN were discussed based on findings from a pre-workshop, self-administered questionnaire survey. The workshop ended with four key areas unanimously recommended for regional collaboration strengthening: (1) system development for vaccine security; (2) human resource development; (3) ASEAN price policy for vaccine (APPV) and pooled procurement; and (4) communication and coordination. A call for immediate action was made, prompting the second workshop to focus only on "communication and coordination" to identify concrete, actionable collaborative models for effective communication and coordination. At the second workshop, a five-year Communication and Coordination Action Plan (CCAP) was developed to foster long-term AVSSR.
   The AVSSR's ultimate goal is to avoid incidental vaccine shortage and ensure sufficient supply of affordable, quality vaccines for normal and urgent situations both at the national and ASEAN-wide levels. To date, collaboration for AVSSR is being strengthened according to the ASEAN post-2015 Health Development Agenda and its collaborative framework among concerned countries and development partners. Nevertheless, to achieve the goal, integration of multiple strategies based upon strong policy commitment and uninterrupted engagement among relevant partners are required. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Passing the Blood-Brain-Barrier (BBB) is a challenging aspect in nanomedicine. Utilizing surfactant particles is reported to be a potent strategy for easier BBB penetration. On the other hand, loading different functional molecules on a single particle is therapeutically and economically beneficial. In this study, multifunctional amphiphilic Janus nanoparticles have been prepared on the basis of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. This Janus platform is armed with folic acid targeting agent and Doxorubicin (DOX) drug that have been conjugated on different sides of the nanoparticles. DOX has been conjugated via imine bond that makes these particles pH sensitive. Chemo-physical characters, in-vitro drug release pattern and toxicity of nanoparticles on rat C6 glioma cell line were studied that confirmed the preparation and pH-dependent behavior of nanoparticles. Microscopy observations showed the Janus morphology of nanoparticles and their cell penetration behavior. Prepared Janus nanoparticle can be utilized as a multifunctional nanomedicine platform for brain cancer treatment.

HA is generally supplied as an injection commonly reported as painful, with strong limitations after treatment. In this study, an alternative delivery system was constructed based on HA hydrogel and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particles with oleic acid. Development studies included the determination of particle toxicity, hemolytic activity, in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity using macrophages and a murine model, respectively. This study showed that empty PLGA particles presented a mean size of 373 nm, while particles containing HA and oleic acid showed a marked particle size increase. The HA association efficiency was of 73.6% and 86.2% for PLGA particles without and with oleic acid, respectively. The in vitro HA release from PLGA particles revealed a sustained profile. Particles showed a good in vitro cell compatibility and the risk of hemolysis was less < 1%, ensuring their safety. The in vivo anti-inflammatory study showed a higher inhibition for HA-loaded PLGA particles when compared to HA solution (78% versus 60%) and they were not different from the positive control, clearly suggesting that this formulation may be a promising alternative to the current HA commercial dosage form.

AB Non-healing wounds are among the serious complications of type-2-diabetes around the globe, associated with high incidence of bacterial infection, chronic nerve and blood vessel damage, and eventually repeated amputation of limbs and organs. Silver nanoparticles offer strong wound healing potential due to their well-known antibacterial activities. The present study reports the development of silver nanoparticle impregnated chitosan-poly ethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel to accelerate wound healing in diabetic patients. The aim of the study was to formulate a sustained and slow release of silver nanoparticle using chitosan-PEG-Silver Nitrate based hydrogel for the treatment of chronic diabetic wounds. The silver nanoparticle containing chitosan-PEG pre-polymer solution was synthesized by reducing silver nitrate with PEG and chitosan solution, thereby, transforming the silver ions into silver nanoparticles. The resulted pre-polymer solution was then crosslinked using glutaraldehyde to form the desired hydrogel. The developed silver nanoparticle impregnated chitosan hydrogel was characterized using ultra-violet (UV) visible spectrophotometry, Fourier Transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) followed by the determination of porosity, and swelling properties. The release of AgNPs from hydrogel was determined by UV-vis spectroscopy followed by antimicrobial and antioxidant assays. The wound healing efficacy of the synthesized hydrogel was evaluated in diabetic rabbits. The results demonstrated a higher porosity, higher degree of swelling and higher water vapor transition rate (WVTR) for silver nanoparticle impregnated hydrogel compared to bare chitosan-PEG hydrogel as well as improved antimicrobial and antioxidant properties in-vitro and enhanced wound healing capability in-vivo in diabetic rabbits. The hydrogel showed a slow and sustained release of AgNPs over a period of at least seven days manifesting the slow biodegradation of developed hydrogels. The improved antimicrobial, antioxidant and wound healing results indicate that the silver nanoparticle impregnated chitosan-PEG hydrogel can be a promising material for wound healing dressing for chronic diabetic wounds.

AB The effect of thermal binders on the physicochemical properties of gabapentin, a thermally labile drug, in granules prepared using twin-screw melt granulation was investigated in this study. Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), a thermoplastic high molecular-weight binder, was compared against conventional low molecular-weight semi-crystalline thermal binders PEG 8000 and Compritol. Both the chemical degradation and polymorph form change of gabapentin were analyzed. The effects of particle size and molecular weight of HPC on the properties of granules were also studied. To overcome the high melt viscosity of HPC, higher barrel temperatures and higher specific mechanical energy were required to attain suitable granules. As a result, higher levels of gabapentin degradant were observed in HPC-based formulations. However, gabapentin form change was not observed in all formulations. Smaller particle size and lower molecular weight of HPC led to faster granule growth. The tabletability of granules was insensitive to the variations in particle size and molecular weight of HPC. Gabapentin crystal size reduction, HPC size reduction, and HPC enrichment on granule surface were observed for HPC-based granules.

ID BREAST-CANCER; NUCLEOSIDE; CONJUGATE
AB Gemcitabine (Gem) as an anti-cancer agent has been limited by its short circulation time and rapid metabolism that reflects in low tumor uptake and low therapeutic efficiency. To improve its anti-tumor activity, a novel FAP alpha enzyme-activated prodrug of Z-GP-Gem modified at 4-amino group of Gem was developed, which could effectively release parent Gem based on the specific cleavage via FAP alpha enzyme-activation in tumor micro-environment. Compared to Gem, the Z-GP-Gem prodrug exhibited significantly enhanced inhibition of both tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis in BALB/c mice bearing orthotopic breast 4T1 tumors. The Z-GP-Gem prodrug has a prolonged circulation time and a high tumor uptake based on the modification of Z-GP dipeptide at 4-amino group of Gem. These eventually caused a marked improvement in the systemic toxicity and the tumor growth inhibition in 4T1 cells. More interestingly, the unexpected depletion of tumor-associated fibroblast (TAF) was observed during the treatment of Z-GP-Gem prodrug in animal model. Therefore, these findings demonstrated that the FAP alpha-activated prodrug Z-GP-Gem would be a desirable approach for tumor therapy by intravenous administration.

AB Linear Polyethylenimine (lPEI) is an efficient cationic polymer for transfecting cells, both in vitro and in vivo, but poses concerns regarding cytotoxicity. Histidinylated lPEI (His-lPEI) exhibits also high transfection efficiency but lower cytotoxicity than lPEI. For the first time, we tested polyfection efficiency of polyplexes comprising both lPEI and His-lPEI. A series of pDNA polyplexes was prepared with mixtures of lPEI and His-lPEI and the amount of each polymer within His-lPEI/lPEI polyplexes was determined by flow cytometry. We show that His-lPEI/;PEI polyplexes exhibit properties similar to lPEI polyplexes in terms of size, morphology, assembly with pDNA, and polyplex stability while His-lPEI/lPEI polyplexes exhibit properties similar to His-1PEI polyplexes in terms of buffering capacity. Compared to polyplexes consisting only of ;PEI or His-lPEI, the transfection profile reveals that His-lPEI/lPEI polyplexes containing 30% to 57% lPEI strongly increase polyfection efficiency of NIH3T3 fibroblasts and murine, as well as human skeletal muscle cell lines without cytotoxicity. Importantly, improved transfection of human dystrophin deficient skeletal muscle cell lines was obtained. These results indicate that His-lPEI/lPEI polyplexes are an improved non-viral vector for efficient transfection of dystrophin deficient skeletal muscle cell lines that should be tested on animals.

AB Meloxicam is an anti-inflammatory drug that could be interesting to deliver locally to the lungs to treat inflammation occurring in cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Spray drying conditions were optimized to prepare inhalable dry powders, from meloxicam aqueous solution with pH adjustment. A comparison study between non-porous and large porous particles (LPPs) was carried out to demonstrate the relevance of the aimed large size ( > 5 mu m) and low density (< 0.2 mg/cm(3)) formulations. With the appropriate amount of porogen agent, ammonium bicarbonate, LPPs exhibited the same aerodynamic diameter and a higher deposited fraction than smaller but dense particles. The aerodynamic evaluation of LPPs showed that the fine particle fraction (FPF) reached up to 65.8%, while the emitted fraction (EF) reached 85.4%, both higher than for the non-porous particles. Stability tests demonstrated that, after 10 weeks of storage, no significant difference could be detected in the aerodynamic behaviour of the formulations. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time large porous particles, with enhanced aerodynamic properties, from an aqueous solution of meloxicam are reported.

AB Polydopamine (PDA) has been a simple, novel and versatile method to prepare targeted nanoparticles, which can be used as a platform for conjugating targeted ligands to polymer carriers without reactive chemical groups. To better understand the difference between the novel PDA method and conventional chemical synthesis way, we developed two kinds of folate (FA)-targeted liposomes loaded doxorubicin (DOX) by the above methods. FA-PDA-DOX liposomes and DOX-FA liposomes represented PDA and conventional method, respectively. FA-PDA-DOX liposomes had a smaller particle size than DOX-FA liposomes, and both of them presented good stability, spherical morphology, strong inhibition effect to HeLa cells and high drug accumulation in the tumor site. There were no significant differences between the two targeted liposomes in the in vitro cytotoxicity study and in vivo bio-distribution assay. While only FA-PDA-DOX liposomes showed pH-sensitive properties, which was attributed to the PDA layers and can control the drug release better. Compared to DOX-FA liposomes, FA-PDA-DOX liposomes were much safer in an antitumor experiment in vivo, and the inhibition rate was still over 70%. This study demonstrated the PDA method could achieve therapeutic levels similar to traditional methods in a simpler and safer way, which can be useful and promising nanocarriers for drug delivery system in the future.

AB Thermosensitive hydrogels are in situ gelling systems composed of hydrophilic homopolymers or block copolymers which remain as solutions at room temperature and form gels after administration into the body. Its application in advanced drug delivery has gained significant attention in recent years. The tunable characteristics of thermosensitive hydrogels make them versatile and capable of incorporating both hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds and macromolecules. The drug molecules can be included as free molecules or preformulated into nano- or micro-particles or liposomes. Although there were several reviews on the materials of thermosensitive hydrogels, the compatibility between the drug and thermosensitive material as well as its in vitro release mechanisms and in vivo performance have barely been investigated. The current review is proposed aiming to not only provide an update on the recent development in thermosensitive hydrogel formulations for nasal, ocular and cutaneous deliveries, but also identify the relationship between the drug characteristics and the loading strategies, and their impacts on the release mechanisms and the in vivo performance. Our current update for the first time highlights the essential features for successful development of in situ thermosensitive hydrogels to facilitate nasal, ocular or cutaneous drug deliveries.

AB Local drug delivery into oral cavity offers many advantages over systemic administration in treatment of the oral infections. In this study, monolayer and bilayered mucoadhesive film and wafer formulations were developed as local drug delivery platforms using chitosan and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC). Cefuroxime axetil (CA) was used as the model drug. Surface morphology, mechanical strength, water uptake, in vitro adhesion, disintegration and in vitro release properties of the formulations were investigated. Furthermore, antimicrobial activity of the formulations was evaluated against E. coli and S. aureus. HPMC based formulations were found to disintegrate within < 30 min whereas chitosan based formulations remained intact up to 6 h. Significantly higher drug release was obtained with wafer formulations. Antimicrobial activity was found to increase in presence of chitosan, and HPMC was also observed to contribute to this action. Bilayered wafer formulation, with adhesive chitosan backing layer and HPMC based drug loaded layer, providing prolonged drug release and suitable adhesive properties, with suitable mechanical strength, would be suggested as a promising local delivery system for treatment of the infections in the oral cavity.

AB Coronary artery disease is the first cause of death across the world. Targeted delivery of therapeutics through controlled release of micro- and nano-particles remains a very capable approach to develop new strategies in treating restenosis and atherosclerotic plaques. In this research, to produce the arterial geometry, an image-processing was done using CT-scan images of a LAD coronary artery. After implementing the finite element mesh, the Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) simulation based on physiological boundary conditions was performed. Next, a Lagrangian description of particles dynamics in a non-Newtonian blood flow considering momentum equation of motion for each particle and the imposed external magnetic field was provided. Under the influence of the magnetic field, the optimal particle size scope for which the surface density of particles (SDP) adhered on the plaque lumen reaches its maximum was specified. Also, our results signify that applying a magnetic field can adversely affect the delivery of particles to the targeted site for near micron-size particles. Along with the evaluation of the Brownian and the gravitational forces on nanoparticles, the uniformity of the distribution of particles in the left coronary network with and without the presence of the magnetic field has been studied. In conclusion, the external magnetic field has increased the SDP adhered on the targeted surface by 49.4% and 59.7% for 400 and 600 nm particles, respectively.

AB Cracking patterns in four kinds of granules, based on the common pharmaceutical excipient microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and subject to compressive load, were examined. The initial pore structure and the location of initial failure under uniaxial compression were assessed using X-ray micro-computed tomography, whereas contact force development and onset of cracking under more complex compressive load were examined using a triaxial testing apparatus. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations were employed for numerical analysis of the stress distributions prior to cracking. For granules subject to uniaxial compression, initial cracking always occurred along the meridian and the precise location of the crack depended on the pore structure. Likewise, for granules subject to triaxial compression, the fracture plane of the primary crack was generally parallel to the dominant loading direction. The occurrence of cracking was highly dependent on the triaxiality ratio, i.e. the ratio between the punch displacements in the secondary and dominant loading directions. Compressive stresses in the lateral directions, induced by triaxial compression, prevented crack opening and fragmentation of the granule, something that could be verified by simulations. These results provide corroboration as well as further insights into previously observed differences between confined and unconfined compression of granular media.

AB Despite the presence of a variety of modern anticancer drugs at the market, doxorubicin (Dox) is still widely used in antineoplastic therapy, although its administration causes severe side effects. To enhance specific activity of such molecules, various approaches have been exploited: targeted moieties like monoclonal antibodies, oncospecific proteins and peptides are utilized as specific vector molecules; environment sensitive linkers are exploited to facilitate transported drug release at the target point etc. Acid-labile linkers are frequently used in synthesis due to the ability to be cleaved inside specific cellular compartments with acidic environment, avoiding possible recycling mechanisms. Two types of conjugates containing different acid-labile linkers have been synthesized. In vitro efficiency of doxorubicin conjugates with recombinant receptor-binding domain of human alpha-fetoprotein (3dAFPpG) synthesized with use of cis-aconitic anhydride (CAA) and linker based on succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP) and 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionic acid hydrazide (PDPH) was compared. The 3dAFPpG-SPDP-PDPH-Dox revealed a comparable with unmodified doxorubicin cytotoxic effect against the Dox sensitive MCF7 cell line and greater cytotoxicity against the anthracycline resistant MCF7(Adr) cells. Meanwhile the 3dAFPpG-CAA-Dox cytotoxic effect was significantly lower, although doxorubicin's pH-dependent release profiles and intracellular accumulation rates were similar. These differences in cytotoxic activity were arguably explained by the dissimilarities in intracellular doxorubicin localization, which may originate from thiol reductase activity in lysosomes and late endosomes.

AB Amorphous solid dispersions are a promising option for managing compounds with poor aqueous solubility. However, for compounds with high melting points, thermal stability limitations, or poor solubility in volatile solvents, conventional routes of hot melt extrusion or spray drying may not be viable. Co-precipitated amorphous dispersions (cPAD) can provide a solution. For the material studied in this paper, the cPAD material that was seemingly identical to spray dried material in terms of being single phase amorphous (as measured by DSC and XRD ) but showed slower dissolution behavior. It was identified that physical properties of the cPAD material could be improved to enhance wettability and improve dissolution performance. This was achieved by incorporating the cPAD material into a matrix of water soluble excipients generated via evaporative isolation routes. Importantly, this approach appears to offer another route to further increase the drug load in final dosage units and is significant as increased drug loading generally results in slower or incomplete release. Results showed successful proof of concept via in vitro biorelevant dissolution and confirmatory canine pharmacokinetic studies yielding comparable exposure for capsules comprised of conventional spray dried material as well as capsules with elevated drug load comprised of cPAD hierarchical particles.

AB Roller compaction is the main technique employed in dry granulation. Ribbon sticking and splitting are among the major factors that can hinder the use of this process for some formulations. Ribbon splitting can occur either transversally (through the ribbon thickness) or longitudinally (through the ribbon width). It was observed that transverse splitting is commonly associated with sticking of the split ribbons to the rollers and results in an inferior performance of the process. Longitudinal splitting is associated with an across-width distribution of the ribbon density so that there may an adverse effect on the mechanical strength and dissolution properties of the tablets formed from the milled granules. The aim of the current work was to elucidate the mechanisms of splitting by an experimental study involving single component powders with a range of yield strengths, including those that are commonly used as excipients. Both smooth and knurled rollers were employed without and with lubrication by applying magnesium stearate to the rollers. The minimum gap was fixed and the maximum roll stress was varied. The observed trends for the smooth rollers were rationalised in terms of a splitting index, which is a measure of the residual stresses driving crack growth relative to the tensile strength of the ribbons. There was a lower limit at which splitting was observed but the occurrence of transverse splitting decreased and that for longitudinal splitting increased with increasing values of the index, which was accompanied by an increase in mixed transverse-longitudinal splitting. Transverse splitting was always associated with sticking to the rollers and was prevented by external lubrication. The main difference with the knurled rollers was that in some cases transverse splitting occurred without sticking to the rollers. A detailed discussion of the mechanisms involved is presented.

AB Lipid-based drug delivery systems are considered as promising vehicles for hydrophobic drug compounds. Lipid distribution within the droplet can affect drug loading capacity in these carriers. However, it is extremely challenging to determine the nanostructure within these carriers through the implementation of the direct experimental methods due to the ultrafine size. Therefore, coarse grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was utilized to model different kinds of lipid-based nanoparticles of the diameter about 12 nm including solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), nanoemulsion (NE), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), and the organization of the lipids within the carriers was explored. The aforementioned nanoparticles consisted of stearic acid, oleic acid as lipids, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as a surfactant in water medium. Furthermore, the impact of solid to liquid mass ratio on the lipid distribution within the lipid matrix was investigated regarding the NLC simulations. In the equilibrium state, we observed the vesicle-like structure for all the investigated systems in which the hydrophilic moieties of the lipids and surfactant organized a semi-bilayer fold into the droplet and the hydrophobic tails accumulated among them. It is worth mentioning although SDS as a harsh surfactant, which is a special case, was expected to be present in the surface of the droplet, it penetrated into the lipids. Additionally, our results showed remarkable entrapped water beads inside the droplet in the form of one or more cavities along the internal layer of the head groups which was surrounded by lipid head groups. It was also reported that in the building structure of the nanoemulsion and SLN, in the central parts of the droplets, lipids were denser than the case of NLCs. Moreover, no crystallization occurred within the lipid-based carriers. Finally, the results indicated that, in the case of NLC simulations, the lipid distribution within the lipid matrix was insensitive to the mass fraction of solid to liquid lipids.

AB Vaginal rings (VRs) are currently marketed for contraceptive or hormone regulation purposes, and in-vestigationally, have been widely reported for delivery of antiretrovirals to reduce HIV transmission. To date, there is no national or international standard for the mechanical testing and minimum performance characteristics of any VR based products. Here, we describe a series of mechanical tests examining the durometer hardness, static and dynamic compression response, tensile properties and twist resistance of vaginal rings. The tests were conducted on currently marketed VRs and a number of the International Partnership for Microbicides' (IPM) investigational VR formulations. With wider application in the field, the tests described herein could form the basis for a more standardised approach to the mechanical testing of VRs.

AB Protein aggregates have been discussed for a long time as a potential risk factor for immunogenicity in patients. Meanwhile, many research groups have investigated the immunogenicity of differently produced aggregates using in vitro or in vivo models. Despite all knowledge gained in these studies still little is known about the mechanisms of immunogenicity and the kind of protein aggregates bearing the greatest risk for immunogenicity. The choice of a suitable test model regarding the predictability of immunogenicity of protein aggregates in humans plays a major role and influences results and conclusions substantially. In this review we will provide an overview of the test models recently used for the evaluation of immunogenicity of protein aggregates; we will discuss advantages and drawbacks regarding their usability and predictive power for immunogenicity in humans.

AB Acute otitis media (AOM), an infection in the middle ear, is usually treated through systemic administration of antibiotics because the stratum corneum of the intact tympanic-membrane (TM) possesses low permeability that holds against the ototopical antibiotics use. Therefore, the objective of this work was to encapsulate levofloxacin (LFX) into polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) decorated nanoliposomes (PNLs) as an approach for drug delivery through the intact tympanic-membrane. LFX loaded-PNLs were primed by ethanol injection technique. A 2(3) full factorial design, using Design-Expert (R) software, was developed to optimize formulation variables. Particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential and entrapment efficiency percent of the formulae were determined. The optimal formulation (F7, prepared using 30:1 phospholipid to drug weight ratio, 30 mg cholesterol and 125 mg PEG 400) exhibited improved ex vivo trans-tympanic permeation compared to nanoliposomes lacking PEG 400 and drug solution. In addition, F7 showed greater extent of in vivo deposition of LFX in the intact TM compared to drug solution. Furthermore, in vivo histopathological examination proved the tolerability of the PNLs after ototopical application. Overall, the obtained results revealed that PNLs could be promising for LFX delivery through intact TM providing means for the ototopical drug application for treatment of acute middle ear infections.

AB This paper compares batch and continuous technologies in terms of product quality and process performance in pharmaceutical tablet manufacturing using ethenzamide as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Batch and continuous processes using wet granulation were investigated by performing experiments on the scale of 5 and up to 100 kg/lot, using the same raw materials. Three technologies were tested and compared: (i) batch technology using fluidized bed granulation, (ii) batch technology using high shear granulation, (iii) continuous technology using high shear granulation. In the full-scale experiment, in all three technologies including continuous technology, the quality of the tablets fulfilled the target values regarding hardness, active pharmaceutical ingredient content, and dissolution. The granules produced by different technologies, however, presented varying attributes regarding granule size distribution, loose bulk density, or scanning electron microscope images. The process performance, more specifically the yield, was slightly better for batch technologies than for the continuous technology, mainly due to losses in the start-up operation. Notably, this study has shown that continuous technology, which is generally believed to not entail scale-up procedures, could in fact, require parameter adjustment for prolonged operation. The results provided suggestions for improvements to implement large-scale continuous technologies in the pharmaceutical industry.

AB Lauroyl-gemcitabine lipid nanocapsules (GemC(12)-LNC) hydrogel, administered intratumorally or perisurgically in the tumor resection cavity, increases animal survival in several orthotopic GBM models. We hypothesized that GemC(12)-LNC can be used as nanodelivery platform for other drugs, to obtain a combined local therapeutic approach for GBM. Paclitaxel (PTX) was selected as a model molecule and PTX-GemC(12)-LNC formulation was evaluated in terms of physicochemical and mechanical properties. The PTX-GemC(12)-LNC hydrogel stability and drug release were evaluated over time showing no significant differences compared to GemC(12)-LNC. The drug combination was evaluated on several GBM cell lines showing increased cytotoxic activity compared to the original formulation and synergy between PTX and GemC(12). Our results suggest that GemC(12)-LNC hydrogel can be used as nanodelivery platform for dual drug delivery to encapsulate active agents with different mechanisms of action to achieve a better antitumor efficacy against GBM or other solid tumors.

AB Therapeutic peptides are facing an increasing interest as drugs for the treatment of many diseases. The challenge in the administration of such drugs, due to inherent properties of these peptides, is to make them bioavailable. Self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) are considered a suitable and promising strategy to deliver the peptides and increase their bioavailability. However, to enter into the SEDDS nanodroplets, the peptides must be made hydrophobic by complexation with surfactants (formation of hydrophobic ion pair, HIP). The aim of this work is to assess the possibility to quantify the amount of released peptides and of the remaining docusate/peptide HIP in the nanodroplets by Taylor Dispersion Analysis (FDA) on two therapeutic peptides (leuprorelin and desmopressin). It also clearly demonstrates that the logP value of the peptide has a strong influence on the extent of HIP inside of the SEDDS nanodroplets. For instance leuprorelin-docusate complex (logP = 3) was 100% inside of the nanodroplets at low ionic strength, while for desmopressin-docusate complex (logP = 0.5) only 30% were able to enter the nanodroplets. It was also shown that an increase in the ionic strength of the release media allowed to increase the amount of released peptide up to 80% for leuprorelin and 100% for desmopressin, at physiological ionic strength. TDA experiments allowed to determine the partitioning coefficient, logD value, of the peptide between the SEDDS and continuous aqueous phases. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that TDA is a rapid, straightforward and useful technique for developing SEDDS formulations.

AB A dissolution apparatus that uses a small volume of stationary medium (25 mu L) has been developed for in vitro dissolution testing of respirable drug particles and used to evaluate the dissolution of two anti-tubercular drugs, moxifloxacin and ethionamide. Solubilities of moxifloxacin and ethionamide in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) were 17.68 +/- 0.85 mg mL(-1) and 0.46 +/- 0.02 mg mL(-1) whereas in the presence of lung surfactant (0.4% w/v Curosurf (R) in PBS) solubilities were 20.76 +/- 0.35 mg m(-1) and 0.56 +/- 0.03 mg mL(-1), respectively. A fine particle dose (similar to 50 mu g) of aerodynamically separated moxifloxacin or ethionamide particles ( < 6.4 mu m) was collected onto a glass coverslip using a modified Twin Stage Impinger. The dissolution behaviour of the fine particle dose was evaluated at various perfusate flow rates (0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 mL min(-1) of PBS), mucus simulant concentrations (1.0, 1.5 and 2.0% w/v polyethylene oxide in PBS), and in the presence of lung surfactant. The dissolution behaviour of the respirable size particles was observed under an optical microscope and the dissolved drug that diffused into the perfusate was quantified by HPLC. The moxifloxacin particles disappeared quickly and showed faster permeation ( < 30 min) compared to the ethionamide particles at all the dissolution conditions evaluated. This study demonstrated the differences in the dissolution rates of moxifloxacin and ethionamide particles and may be useful to estimate the residence time of the inhaled dry powder particles in the lungs.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the choice of polymer and polymer level on the performance of the microstructure and wettability of hot-melt extruded solid dispersion of Glyburide (Gly) as a model drug. The produced solid dispersion were characterised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), image analysis using a focus variation instrument (FVI), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), Xray microtomography (X mu T), dynamic contact angle measurement and dissolution analysis using biorelevant dissolution media (FASSIF). SEM and focus variation analysis showed that the microstructure and surface morphology was significantly different between samples produced. This was confirmed by further analysis using X mu T which showed that an increase in polymer content brought about a decrease in the porosity of the hot-melt extruded dispersions. DSC suggested complete amorphorisation of Gly whereas XRPD suggested incomplete amorphorisation. The static and dynamic contact angle measurement correlated with the dissolution studies using FASSIF media indicating that the initial liquid imbibition process as captured by the dynamic contact angle directly affects the dissolution performance.

AB The purpose of this work was to develop an in situ thermosensitive electro-responsive mucoadhesive gel loaded with bioactive agent (nanocomposite) meant for nose to brain delivery in a controllable manner when electric stimulation is applied. Nanocomposite was developed using a combinatorial blending of chitosan, hydro-xypropylmethylcellulose, pluronic F127 and polyaniline which was then loaded with BCNU-Nano-co-Plex (the bioactive agent). The nanocomposite was a liquid at room temperature but formed an in situ mucogel at a temperature of 27.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C. Furthermore, the nanocomposite possessed a redox element which makes it responsive to electrical stimulation (ES). The stimuli responsiveness enabled the formulation to release the bioactive agent when electrical potential was applied and demonstrated a desired 10.28% release of nanoparticles per application cycle. The results further revealed pore formation within the formulation which accommodated the loaded nanoparticles. The release profile also demonstrated a pulsatile release of the bioactive material when subjected to ES. This formulation may therefore be useful as a nose to brain drug delivery system that can be modulated to deliver bioactive agents to the brain via electro-actuation in an "on-off" drug release kinetics by means of an external ES for a controlled nose-to-brain delivery.

AB Glycyrrhizic acid is the main active component of Licorice root which has been known in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine since ancient times. In these cultures glycyrrhizic acid (GA) is one of the most frequently used drugs. However, only in 21-st century a novel unusual property of the GA to enhance the activity of other drugs has been discovered. The review describes briefly the experimental evidences of wide spectrum of own biological activities of glycyrrhizic acid as well as discusses the possible mechanisms of the ability of GA to enhance the activity of other drugs. We have shown that due to its amphiphilic nature GA is able to form self-associates in aqueous and non-aqueous media, as well as water soluble complexes with a wide range of lipophilic drugs. The main purpose of our review is to focus reader's attention on physicochemical studies of the molecular mechanisms of GA activity as a drug delivery system (DDS). In our opinion, the most intriguing feature of glycyrrhizic acid which might be the key factor in its therapeutic activity is the ability of GA to incorporate into the lipid bilayer and to increase the membrane fluidity and permeability. The ability of biomolecules and their aggregates to change the properties of cell membranes is of great significance, from both fundamental and practical points of view.

AB An innovative delivery system for melatonin, based on the incorporation of solid lipid microparticles in orodispersible films (ODFs) made of maltodextrin, was designed and developed. Lipid microparticles at two different melatonin concentrations (10 and 20% w/w) were produced by the spray congealing technology using two different lipid carrier (tristearin and hydrogenated castor oil) and characterized in terms of size, solid state, drug loading and drug release pattern. Tristearin microparticles were discarded due to a polymorphic modification of the carrier. The incorporation of hydrogenated castor oil microparticles in ODFs by using the casting method did not alter significantly the shape and dimension of the microparticles and the mechanical properties (elasticity and strength) of the films, which remained acceptable for manufacturing and handling. The in vitro release studies performed in saliva, gastric and intestinal simulated media on ODFs containing melatonin loaded in hydrogenated castor oil microparticles revealed the possibility to combine with an immediate release of the drug and a sustained release over at least 5 h period.
   In conclusion, the proposed drug delivery system maintains the advantages of ODFs, i.e. the suitability to be swallowed without water, and permits the tuning of drug release according to the clinical needs by modulating the ratio of free and microencapsulated drug in the ODF.

AB In this study, we developed novel thermal and redox-responsive micelles based on the Pluronic F127 tri-block copolymer and employed these for redox-responsive intratumor release of bufalin, an anti-cancer drug. Pluronic F127 was first functionalized with carboxylate groups, and then assembled into micelles. The HOOC-F127-COOH micelles are 20 +/- 4 nm in size at 37 degrees C, but expand to 281 +/- 5 nm when cooled to 4 degrees C. This allows for the free diffusion of bufalin into the micellar cores at low temperatures, while at 37 degrees C the micelles are much more compact and the drug molecules can be effectively held in their interiors. A high encapsulation efficiency and loading content were obtained via drug incorporation at 4 degrees C. The drug-loaded micelles were cross-linked with cystamine, which contains a disulfide bond responsive to the local cancer microenvironment. In vitro studies showed that drug release from the cross-linked micelles was low under normal physiological conditions, but markedly accelerated upon exposure to conditions representative of the intracellular tumor environment. Confocal microscopy revealed that the cross-linked micelles gave high levels of drug release inside the cells. In vivo studies in mice showed the drug-loaded cross-linked micelles have potent anti-tumor activity, leading to high levels of apoptosis of tumor cells and significant reductions in tumor volume. The drug-loaded cross-linked micelles did not significantly influence body weight, and there was no evidence for detrimental off-target effects. These results indicate that the Pluronic-based micelles developed in this work are promising drug delivery systems for the targeted treatment of cancer.

AB The use of shape memory polymers exhibiting water-induced shape recovery at body temperature and water solubility was proposed for the development of indwelling devices for intravesical drug delivery. These could be administered via catheter in a suitable temporary shape, retained in the bladder for a programmed period of time by recovery of the original shape and eliminated with urine following dissolution/erosion. Hot melt extrusion and fused deposition modeling 3D printing were employed as the manufacturing techniques, the latter resulting in 4D printing because of the shape modifications undergone by the printed item over time. Pharmaceutical-grade poly(vinyl alcohol) was selected based on its hot-processability, availability in different molecular weights and on preliminary data showing water-induced shape memory behavior. Specimens having various original and temporary geometries as well as compositions, successfully obtained, were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic-mechanical thermal analysis as well as for fluid uptake, mass loss, shape recovery and release behavior. The samples exhibited the desired ability to recover the original shape, consistent in kinetics with the relevant thermo-mechanical properties, and concomitant prolonged release of a tracer. Although preliminary in scope, this study indicated the viability of the proposed approach to the design of retentive intravesical delivery systems.

AB For many years, researchers have worked with supramolecular structures involving inclusion complexes with cyclodextrins. These studies have resulted in new commercially available drugs which have been of great benefit. More recently, studies using nanoparticles, including nanosystems containing cyclodextrins, have become a focus of academic research due to the versatility of the systems and their remarkable therapeutic potential. This review focuses on studies published between 2002 and 2018 involving nanosystems containing cyclodextrins. We consider the type of nanosystems, their importance in a health context, the physicochemical techniques used to show the quality of these systems and their potential for the development of novel pharmaceutical formulations. These have been developed in recent studies which have mainly been focusing on basic science with no clinical trials as yet being performed. This is important to note because it means that the studies do not include any toxicity tests. Despite this limitation, the characterization assays performed suggest that these new formulations may have therapeutic potential. However, more research is required to assess the efficacy and safety of these nanosystems.

AB In this study, we developed a novel Fe3O4 nanoparticles-doxorubicin (DOX)-Hyaluronic acid (HA) nanoparticles on the basis of firstly discovered "formed porous structure" in spontaneously assembled Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The Mechanism of Action (MOA) behind this porous DOX-loading cargo was tested and confirmed. A multi-functional Fe3O4-DOX + HA nanoparticle was further constructed by incorporating HA into our system. In vitro and in vivo studies exhibited that Fe3O4-DOX + HA owned enhanced antitumor efficacy with significantly prolonged survival time due to the combination of M-1 polarization ability of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, tumor killing effect of DOX and tumor and TAM-targeting effect of HA. All in all, our studies offer a novel strategy to develop a multifunctional antitumor system with a simple preparation method and an enhanced therapeutic outcome.

AB Topical preparations of capsaicin, the major pungent ingredient of hot pepper, are being used for management of pain and inflammatory disorders. Purpose of this study was to use nanoemulsion as an effective topical drug carrier for in vivo delivery of capsaicin. An oil-in-water nanoemulsion containing capsaicin was prepared by spontaneous emulsification method. Optimized formulation showed a median droplet diameter (d50) of 13-14 nm and was stable for more than 8 months in room and harsh temperature (i.e. 4 and 45 degrees C). The nanoemulsion was then formulated into topical cream and gel to compare its efficacy and safety profiles with conventional cream of capsaicin. Skin irritation study showed that topical application of capsaicin nanoemulsion was safe and no sign of edema and erythema was observed. The preparation significantly decreased inflammation of rats paw edema compared to the commercial cream and control group, especially in 2nd and 3rd hours of the test. Also, pretreated rats with capsaicin nanoemulsion gel showed very good resistance to the pain caused by heat stimulus. In total, the selected nanoemulsion showed great potential as carrier for topical delivery of capsaicin for improving its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. It was also found that the topical gel outperforms the topical cream as dosage form for the nanoemulsion.

AB A Design of Experiment (DoE) methodology was adopted to investigate and optimize process parameters and formulations variables for preparing an amorphous clotrimazole (CLT) nanosuspension by sonoprecipitation technique. The amorphous nanosuspension can provide a synergistic effect of increase in dissolution velocity and kinetic solubility which can be advantageously used to improve bioavailability of low-solubility drugs. A Box-Behnken design was utilized to study the effect of formulation parameters (drug concentration, polymer concentration, and surfactant concentration) and process parameter (antisolvent: solvent ratio) on particle size, polydispersibility index (PDI), and zeta potential of amorphous CLT nanoparticles. Soluplus (R) and poloxamer 407 were incorporated in the formulation for steric and electrostatic stabilization respectively. The optimized formulation predicted by the developed model was validated experimentally. The micronized amorphous suspension, micronized crystalline suspension and nanocrystalline suspension were prepared as controls. The optimized amorphous nanosuspension and controls were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and polarized light microscopy (PLM) techniques. Additionally, in-vitro dissolution studies were performed. The drug concentration, polymer concentration and antisolvent:solvent ratio were found to be statistically significant in impacting critical quality attributes (CQAs) of drug product. The model developed for zeta potential was insignificant at a 95% confidence interval. The DSC, XRPD and PLM results confirmed the amorphization of CLT by sonoprecipitation process. The DSC thermogram did not show any characteristic endothermic peak, XRPD diffractogram showed amorphous halo pattern whereas PLM images did not illustrate birefringence for amorphous CLT nanosuspension. The in-vitro drug dissolution studies demonstrated relatively higher drug dissolution for amorphous CLT nanosuspension compared to controls at both the dissolution media (de-ionized water and pH 7.2 buffer). The sonoprecipitation process was successfully used to produce a stable amorphous nanosuspension with notably enhanced dissolution velocity by evaluating and optimizing critical process and formulation parameters.

AB The blood brain barrier (BBB) offers protection to the central nervous system (CNS) by maintaining homeostasis. Besides restricting the entry of harmful xenobiotics and endogenous molecules to CNS, BBB also limits the entry of therapeutic agents. Nanotechnology offers the possibility to deliver small molecules/drugs against CNS disorders across BBB. Recently, due to excellent biocompatibility, functional versatility and unique surface electrostatics properties nanodiamonds are also being explored for their drug delivery potential against BBB. Although, studies has been done to understand the mechanisms involved in drug delivery across BBB, but still, progress in the development of any functional drug delivery systems across BBB is in juvenile stages. For this purpose, the strategic developments of more potent drug delivery systems to CNS via endocytic pathways appears to be the most promising approach. Endocytic pathways are essential for communication and transport of nutrients across BBB in endothelial cells. Moreover, modifications of the nanotherapeutic agents with specific brain capillary endothelial cells targeting molecules or ligands have recently shown impressive results of successful delivery of drugs to the brain via receptor-mediated transcytosis. The current review provides a comprehensive insight in the advancements made in nanocarriers-based successful drug delivery to the CNS and their availability in clinics.

AB Bacterial infections represent an important drawback in the orthopaedic field, as they can develop either immediately after surgery procedures or after some years. Specifically, in case of implants, they are alleged to be troublesome as their elimination often compels a surgical removal of the infected implant. A possible solution strategy could involve a local coating of the implant by an antibacterial system, which requires to be easily applicable, biocompatible and able to provide the desired release kinetics for the selected antibacterial drug. Thus, this work focusses on a biphasic system made up by a thermo-reversible gel matrix (Poloxamer 407/water system) hosting a dispersed phase (PLGA micro-particles), containing a model antibacterial drug (vancomycin hydrochloride). In order to understand the key parameters ruling the performance of this delivery system, we developed a mathematical model able to discriminate the drug diffusion inside micro-particles and within the gel phase, eventually providing to predict the drug release kinetics. The model reliability was confirmed by fitting to experimental data, proposing as a powerful theoretical approach to design and optimize such in situ delivery systems.

AB Inhaled antibiotic nanoparticles have emerged as an effective strategy to control infection in bronchiectasis lung owed to their mucus-penetrating ability. Using ciprofloxacin (CIP) as the model antibiotic, we evaluated dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulations of two classes of antibiotic nanoparticles (i.e. liposome and nanoplex) in their (1) physical characteristics (i.e. size, zeta potential, CIP payload, preparation efficiency), (2) dissolution in artificial sputum medium, (3) ex vivo mucus permeability, (4) antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mucus, (5) cytotoxicity towards human lung epithelium cells, and (6) in vitro aerosolization efficiency. The results showed that the CIP nanoplex exhibited fast dissolution with CIP supersaturation generation, in contrast to the slower release of the liposome (80 versus 30% dissolution after 1 h). Both nanoparticles readily overcame the mucus barrier attributed to their nanosize and mucus-inert surface (50% permeation after 1 h), leading to their similarly high antipseudomonal activity. The CIP liposome, however, possessed much lower CIP payload than the nanoplex (84% versus 3.5%), resulting in high lipid contents in its DPI formulation that led to higher cytotoxicity and lower aerosolization efficiency. The CIP nanoplex thus represented a superior formulation owed to its simpler preparation, higher CIP payload hence lower dosage, better aerosolization, and lower cytotoxicity.

AB The objective of the present work aimed to explore the potential of bacterial cellulose (BC) for oral delivery of melatonin (MLT), a natural hormone that faces problems of low solubility and oral bioavailability. BC was hydrolyzed by sulfuric acid followed by the oxidation to prepare bacterial cellulose nanofiber suspension (BCNs). Melatonin-loaded bacterial cellulose nanofiber suspension (MLT-BCNs) was prepared by emulsion solvent evaporation method. The properties of freeze-dried BCs and MLT-BCNs were studied by Fluorescence microscopy (FM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermo gravimetric (TG). The results indicated that the fibers in BCNs became short and thin compared with BC, MLT in MLT-BCNs was uniformly distributed, both BCNs and MLT-BCNs have good thermodynamic stability. The MLT-BCNs showed more rapid dissolution MLT rates compared to the commercially available MLT in SGF and SIF, the dissolution of the cumulative release rate was about 2.1 times of the commercially available MLT. The oral bioavailability of MLT-BCNs in rat was about 2.4 times higher than the commercially available MLT. Thus, MLT-BCNs could act as promising delivery with enhanced dissolution and bioavailability for MLT after oral administration.

AB Most pH-sensitive polymer coating studies for potential colonic delivery systems apply multiple layers to protect the active agent from degradation and early release in the stomach and small intestine. This study designed a single-coat pH-sensitive layer for colon-specific delivery with a potential biopolymer, namely, zein. The tablets were coated with a pH-sensitive film combining zein and Kollicoat (R) MAE 100P. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to study the surface characteristics of the coating layers, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to investigate the molecular interactions between these coating materials. The delivery system showed its potential to prevent the release of drug in gastric and small intestinal simulated media for the delayed release of drug at the expected pH of the colon. The SEM pictures of the coated tablets showed the uniformity of the coating film, although there were some small pores on the surface. The FTIR spectra confirmed that no chemical interaction occurred between two coating materials. The percentage of zein in the coating solution along with the amount of coating were important factors that should be carefully considered during the preparation of the coated tablets to achieve the purpose of this study. This strategy provides a promising design that can effectively carry drugs to the targeted site and also reduce the preparation time.

AB This study aimed to optimize the preparation conditions for cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-modified Polygonatum sibiricum polysaccharide cubosomes (CTAB-modified PSP-Cubs) by response surface methodology (RSM). Glyceryl-monooleate (GMO) was used as the lipid base for the cubosomes. The optimal preparation conditions of CTAB-modified PSP-Cubs were as follows: the mass percentage of PSP to GMO (X-1), Poloxamer 407 (F127) to GMO (X-2) and water to GMO (X-3) was 1.4%, 9% and 50%, respectively. The encapsulation efficiency (EE) of CTAB-modified PSP-Cubs under the experimental conditions was 62.4 +/- 3.6%, which was close to our predicted value. The particle size, polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential of CTAB-modified PSP-Cubs were 427.7 +/- 8.0 nm, 0.236 +/- 0.024 and 19.2 +/- 0.4 mV, respectively. Specific modifications were able to slow down in vitro release behaviors and reduce cytotoxicity to some extent. The effects of CTAB-modified PSP-Cubs on splenic lymphocytes were also investigated. When splenic lymphocytes were treated with CTAB-modified PSP-Cubs together with LPS or PHA, the results showed more favorable effects on cellular proliferation than blank cubosomes or free PSP at certain concentrations.

AB The most important prerequisites for wound coverage matrices are biocompatibility, adequate porosity, degradability and exudate uptake capacity. A moderate hydrophilicity and exudate uptake capacity can often favour cell adhesion and wound healing potential, however, most of the synthetic polymers like polycaprolactone (PCL) are hydrophobic. Hydrogels based on natural polymers can improve the hydrophilicity and exudate uptake capacity of synthetic dressings and improve healing. In this work, we report the development of chitosan ascorbate-infiltrated electrospun PCL membranes. Our study demonstrated that chitosan ascorbate infiltration improves the hydrophilicity as well as water uptake capacity of the membranes and highly favoured the adhesion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human mesenchymal stem cells on the membranes.

TI Is the test for irreversibility of tetanus toxoids still relevant?
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Tetanus vaccines; Toxoids; Test for irreversibility of toxoid; European
   Pharmacopoeia
ID TOXICITY; REVERSION; BINDING
AB Tetanus vaccines for human and veterinary use are based on toxoids resulting from a formaldehyde mediated inactivation of tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT). Due to the high toxicity of TeNT, safety tests are mandatory for each batch of these toxoids. One of the tests addresses the irreversibility of inactivation: The toxoid is stored at 37 degrees C for 6 weeks and then subjected to in vivo toxicity testing.
   However, we found that TeNT solutions rapidly lose their activity at 37 degrees C. Accordingly, any active TeNT molecules arising in the toxoid due to reversion events may no longer be detectable after the 37 degrees C storage period. Furthermore, there is no evidence that a "reversion to toxicity" has ever been observed for tetanus toxoids during vaccine production. Thus, we conclude that the irreversibility test that is prescribed for human and veterinary vaccines has no relevance for vaccine safety. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To systematically review literature on uptake and timeliness of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, measles-mumps-rubella, and/or polio-containing vaccines in infants who were born preterm, with a low birth weight, and/or with chronic health conditions that were diagnosed within the first 6 months of life.
   Methods: Using a standardized search strategy developed by a medical librarian, records were extracted from MEDLINE, Embase, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and CINAHL up to May 8, 2018.
   Results: Out of the 1997 records that were screened, we identified 21 studies that met inclusion criteria. Eleven studies assessed vaccine coverage and/or timeliness in preterm infants, 6 in low birth weight infants, and 7 in children with chronic health conditions. Estimates of coverage in these populations were highly variable, ranging from 40% to 100% across the vaccines and population groups.
   Conclusions: There is a lack of studies reporting coverage and timeliness of routine immunizations in special populations of children.
   Policy implications: Our review suggests a need for improved surveillance of immunization status in special populations of infants, as well as a need for standardization of reporting practices. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Antigenic drift of H9N2 low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (AIV) may result in vaccination failure in the poultry industry and thus a cross-protective vaccine against H9N2 AIV is highly desirable.
   Methods: A series of H9N2 recombinant viruses with the internal genes of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1, PR8) were generated, based on the compatibility between HA and NA, the effect of HA deglycosylation, and protective antigenic epitopes in HA. After evaluation of their biological and immunological characteristics, three recombinant AIVs with the internal genes of the Y280-like strain SN were selected for protective efficacy studies.
   Results: The recombinant viruses rHA(SN)NA(3), rHA(SN)-Delta 200, rHA(SN)-Delta 287, and rHA(SN)-R92G-E93K displayed good cross reactivity and induced higher neutralization antibody titers against both SN and the F98-like strain YZ4. Furthermore, those recombinant viruses had a higher EID50 in chicken embryos after the replacement of internal-gene backbone from PR8 to SN. The rSNHA-Delta 200 induced better protection in immunized chickens against challenge of homologous and heterologous H9N2 avian influenza viruses when compared with the wild type strain.
   Conclusion: The recombinant virus rSNHA-Delta 200 can be used as a potential broad-spectrum vaccine against H9N2 avian influenza. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated gene expression patterns in whole blood and fecal microbiota profile as potential predictors of immune response to vaccination, using healthy M. hyopneumoniae infection free piglets (n = 120). Eighty piglets received a dose of prophylactic antibiotics during the first two days of life, whereas the remaining 40 did not. Blood samples for RNA-Seq analysis were collected on experimental Day 0 (D0; 28 days of age) just prior to vaccination, D2, and D6 post-vaccination. A booster vaccine was given at D24. Fecal samples for microbial 16SrRNA sequencing were collected at 7 days of age, and at D0 and D35 post-vaccination. Pigs were ranked based on the levels of M. hyopneumoniae-specific antibodies in serum samples collected at D35, and groups of 'high' (HR) and 'low' (LR) responder pigs (n =15 each) were selected. Prophylactic antibiotics did not influence antibody titer levels and differential expression analysis did not reveal differences between HR and LR at any time-point (FOR > 0.05); however, based on functional annotation with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, D2 post-vaccination, HR pigs were enriched for biological terms relating to increased activation of immune cells. In contrast, the immune activation decreased in HR, 6 days post-vaccination. No significant differences were observed prior to vaccination (D0). Two days post-vaccination, multivariate analysis revealed that ADAM8, PROSER3, B4GALNT1, MAP7D1, SPP1, HTRA4, and ENO3 genes were the most promising potential biomarkers. At D0, OTUs annotated to Prevotella, CF21, Bacteroidales and S24-7 were more abundant in HR, whereas Fibrobacter, Paraprevotella, Anaerovibrio, [Prevotella], YRC22, and Helicobacter positively correlated with the antibody titer as well as MYL1, SPPI, and ENO3 genes. Our study integrates gene differential expression and gut microbiota to predict vaccine response in pigs. The results indicate that post-vaccination gene-expression and early-life gut microbiota profile could potentially predict vaccine response in pigs, and inform a direction for future research.

ID ELIMINATION; VIRUS
AB Background: With the progressive decline in the incidence of measles in Japan, its diagnosis has become challenging, with fewer physicians having experience in examining measles patients. We aimed to determine the correlates of laboratory-confirmed measles to help physicians improve their measles diagnosis.
   Methods: This study was conducted using the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Disease (NESID) system data during 2011-2015. Among clinically suspected measles patients reported to NESID, measles virus (MV)-positive patients were compared with MV-negative patients. The odds ratios (OR) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) were determined using logistic regression.
   Results: A total of 4168 laboratory-tested patients were notified to NESID. We analysed 618 MV-positive patients (median age, 17 years; interquartile range [IQR], 4-30 years) and 600 MV-negative (median age, 10 years; IQR, 1-29 years) patients after excluding those that met the exclusion criteria or were reported during the rubella epidemic period (the 18th epidemiological week of 2012 to the 46th week of 2013). Having an epidemiological link with a measles patient within 14 days of onset (OR, 14.9; 95% CI, 10.0-23.3), a history of recent international travel (OR, 11.7; 95% CI, 6.9-19.9), and unvaccinated/unknown vaccination status for measles-containing vaccine (MCV; OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.3-5.7) were significantly associated with MV-positive status. International travel (adjusted OR, 10.2; 95% CI, 5.9-17.7) and unvaccinated/unknown MCV vaccination status (adjusted OR, 5.8; 95% CI, 3.5-9.8) remained significantly associated with MV-positive status after adjusting for age, sex, and each other.
   Conclusion: In low-incidence Japan, having an epidemiological link, international travel, and lack of MCV vaccination were correlates of laboratory-confirmed measles. The findings of this study could potentially improve the clinical diagnosis of measles, which can lead to more efficient testing and earlier laboratory confirmation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Hospital contacts and diagnoses five years prior to HPV vaccination

   Register based; Matched case-control study
ID HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINATION; RISK; REGISTER
AB Background: High health care utilization before Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccination might be associated with increased risk of suspected adverse effects (AE's) after vaccination. We investigated the association between hospital contacts and diagnoses before HPV vaccination and risk of later referral to a specialized hospital setting (HPV center) for suspected AE's.
   Methods: The study was a Danish register-based matched case-control study. Cases were females referred to an HPV center. Five controls per case were randomly selected in the source population of HPV vaccinated females. Information on hospital contacts and diagnoses was obtained from the Danish National Patient Registry. Conditional logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the association between having one or more diagnoses in each specific International Classification of Diseases 10th version (ICD-10) chapter five years before the HPV vaccination and subsequent referral to an HPV center.
   Results: We identified 1496 cases and 7480 controls. In total, 80% of the cases versus 65% of the controls had at least one hospital contact prior to HPV vaccination (Prevalence Proportion Ratio - PPR: 1.24 (95% Confidence Interval - CI: 1.21-1.27)), with 24% vs 12% (PPR: 1.97 (95% CI: 1.76-2.19)) having six or more contacts. Cases were more likely to have had a diagnosis in 15 out of 19 ICD-10 chapters before the vaccination, with ORs larger than 1.8 for infectious diseases, psychiatric diseases, diseases of the nervous, circulatory, digestive and musculoskeletal system, unspecific symptoms and unspecific contacts.
   Conclusion: Pre-vaccination morbidity and health care utilization seem to play a role in the path leading to suspected AE's after HPV vaccination. Since many of the diagnoses that were particularly increased before vaccination in referred females are overlapping with the most frequent symptoms reported, we cannot exclude that for some of the females, the suspected AE's might have been existing already before the vaccination.

ID PARENTS; CANADA; CONTROVERSY; ONTARIO; REFUSAL
AB The growth of Web 2.0 has been particularly impactful in shaping information assessment in decision-making with regards to vaccination. The aim of the present study was to explore how attitudes and beliefs about influenza vaccination are exchanged in Web 2.0 through an analysis of user comment threads in response to related news reports on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation national news website (average of 5.8 million unique visitors per month). User comments (n = 2042) were extracted using a Google Chrome data mining extension, from 33 articles reporting on the seasonal influenza vaccine between September 2015 and October 2016. User comments were analyzed using thematic discourse analysis to identify themes within the data, and also identify how information is exchanged, including identifying the rhetorical devices and tactics used. Mostly unrelated to article content, user comments were extremely polarized with only those with strong positions at either end of the vaccination spectrum (for or against) engaging actively in online debates. Observed exchanges, and the use of rhetorical devices and tactics employed by users are identified as furthering or reinforcing polarization. In addition to exchanging information, forums served as 'echo chambers' where individuals connect with likeminded users and collect additional information to reinforce pre-existing beliefs, rather than encouraging the enrichment of user knowledge. Our data lead us to question existing calls for public health engagement in such online forums, as doing so may actually reduce the intention to vaccinate among individuals against vaccination. Rather, we identify a greater need to observe online platforms to better understand the social mechanisms that may contribute to, or reinforce, attitudes and beliefs related to influenza vaccine refusal. Further research may also explore the effect that such dialogue has on the attitudes and beliefs of passively observing individuals who have yet to decide whether to receive the flu vaccine.

AB The development and wide-spread use of mumps vaccine resulted in a dramatic and sustained decrease in the incidence of mumps disease; however, since 2000, an increase in the size and number of mumps outbreaks in the United States and other countries has sparked renewed interest in the durability of mumps-specific immunity elicited by mumps vaccination. The most likely explanation for mumps cases in previously immunized persons may be secondary vaccine failure, or waning immunity. In the current study, we examined changes in markers of measles and mumps immunity at two timepoints, approximately 7 and 17 years after two-dose MMR-II (R) vaccination, in a cohort of 98 healthy adults.
   Our results indicate that mumps IgG titers exhibited a large and significant decline during this time period, while mumps neutralizing Ab titers were relatively stable. There was a similar discrepancy with measles-specific immune responses. For both pathogens, neutralizing antibody titers were fairly low and, given the length of time since vaccination, may have already declined. These data suggest that specific immune outcomes may wane at different rates and highlight our currently incomplete understanding of protective immune responses to mumps and measles.

AB Objective: Influenza vaccination during pregnancy is known to prevent severe influenza illness but its effects on other outcomes and the extent to which its safety is affected by timing of vaccination, maternal race/ethnicity and the type of vaccine is less clear. Therefore, we examined this in a large retrospective cohort.
   Methods: We analyzed medical and vaccination records from the Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) records and from the Kaiser Immunization Tracking System (2008-2016). The study included women who were pregnant with singletons during the influenza season. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to quantify the associations between immunization status during pregnancy and prenatal and postnatal outcomes after adjusting for confounders.
   Results: Of the 247,036 women in these analyses, 53% were vaccinated during their pregnancy. No association between influenza vaccination during pregnancy and adverse prenatal and neonatal outcomes were observed. Influenza vaccination is associated with reduced risk of influenza (OR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.39-0.62), maternal fever (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.35-0.45), preeclampsia (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.90-0.96), placental abruption (OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.82-0.96), stillbirth (OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.78-0.99), and NICU admission (OR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.87-0.92). Both active and inactive vaccines were found to be safe in vaccinated pregnant women regardless of timing of vaccination.
   Conclusions: This study found no evidence of adverse maternal and infant outcomes associated with seasonal influenza vaccine during pregnancy. On the contrary, vaccinated women were less likely to have adverse outcomes than unvaccinated women. The lack of increased adverse outcomes associated with influenza vaccination suggests that the benefits of vaccination during pregnancy to the woman and her child far outweigh any risk, if there is one, from the vaccination.

AB Objective: Vaccination coverage against HPV in France is among the lowest in the industrialized world, although the public authorities have recently become aware of this issue. Few studies have looked at teenaged girls' representations of this vaccination, even though they are the most concerned by it. This qualitative study explored the experiences and representations of HPV vaccination by adolescent girls seeing doctors at least occasionally.
   Study Design: We used a written essay question to explore this issue among 101 adolescent girls at six urban medical centers and a semi-structured interview to discuss it in further depth with five of them. The analysis was lexicometric (ALCESTE (R)) and phenomenological (Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis).
   Results: These results are organized around four superordinate themes: the teenage girls' factual knowledge about this vaccine, their motives for and obstacles to vaccination, their involvement in this decision, and finally the need for information about and solutions to this issue.
   Conclusions: Teenage girls know little about this vaccine and are more sensitive to the emotional discourse that surrounds it than to rational knowledge about it. The requirement for parental authorization for this vaccine reinforces the girls' lack of investment. Vaccination programs should integrate the HPV vaccine more thoroughly into general prevention concerning sexual health and should send a strong signal by offering minors anonymous vaccination free of charge, as is already the case in France for requests for contraception, the morning-after pill, elective abortion, and screening and treatment of sexually transmitted infections.

AB A transmission-blocking vaccine (TBV) against Plasmodium falciparum is likely to be a valuable tool in a malaria eradication program. Pfs230 is one of the major TBV candidates, and multiple Pfs230-based vaccines induced antibodies, which prevented oocyst formation in mosquitoes as determined by a standard membrane-feeding assay (SMFA). Pfs230 is a >300 kDa protein consisting of 14 cysteine motif (CM) domains, and the size and cysteine-rich nature of the molecule have hampered its production as an intact protein. Except for one early study with maltose-binding protein fusion Pfs230 constructs expressed in Esherichia coli, all other studies have focused on only the first four CM domains in the Pfs230 molecule. To identify all possible TBV candidate domains, we systematically produced either single-CM-domain (a total of 14), 2-CM-domain (7), or 4-CM-domain (6) recombinant protein fragments using a eukaryotic wheat germ cell-free expression system (WGCFS). In addition, two more constructs which covered previously published regions, and an N-terminal prodomain construct spanning the natural cleavage site of Pfs230 were produced. Antisera against each fragment were generated in mice and we evaluated the reactivity to native Pfs230 protein by Western blots and immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and functionality by SMFA. All 30 WGCFS-produced Pfs230 constructs were immunogenic in mice. Approximately half of the mouse antibodies specifically recognized native Pfs230 by Western blots with variable band intensities. Among them, seven antibodies showed higher reactivities against native Pfs230 determined by IFA. Interestingly, antibodies against all protein fragments containing CM domain 1 displayed strong inhibitions in SMFA, while antibodies generated using constructs without CM domain 1 showed no inhibition. The results strongly support the concept that future Pfs230-based vaccine development should focus on the Pfs230 CM domain 1. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Non-pathogenic Borrelia burgdorferi expressing Treponema pallidum TprK
   and Tp0435 antigens as a novel approach to evaluate syphilis vaccine
   candidates

AB Background: Syphilis is resurgent in many developed countries and still prevalent in developing nations. Current and future control campaigns would benefit from the development of a vaccine, but although promising vaccine candidates were identified among the putative surface-exposed integral outer membrane proteins of the syphilis spirochete, immunization experiments in the rabbit model using recombinant antigens have failed to fully protect animals upon infectious challenge. We speculated that such recombinant immunogens, purified under denaturing conditions from Escherichia coli prior to immunization might not necessarily harbor their original structure, and hypothesized that enhanced protection would result from performing similar immunization/challenge experiments with native antigens.
   Methods: To test our hypothesis, we engineered non-infectious Borrelia burgdorferi strains to express the tp0897 (tprK) and tp0435 genes of Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum and immunized two groups of rabbits by injecting recombinant strains intramuscularly with no adjuvant. TprK is a putative integral outer membrane protein of the syphilis agent, while tp0435 encodes the highly immunogenic T. pallidum 17-kDa lipoprotein, a periplasmic antigen that was also shown on the pathogen surface. Following development of a specific host immune response to these antigens as the result of immunization, animals were challenged by intradermal inoculation of T. pallidum. Cutaneous lesion development was monitored and treponemal burden within lesions were assessed by dark-field microscopy and RT-qPCR, in comparison to control rabbits.
   Results: Partial protection was observed in rabbits immunized with B. burgdorferi expressing TprK while immunity to Tp0435 was not protective. Analysis of the humoral response to TprK antigen suggested reactivity to conformational epitopes.
   Conclusions: Immunization with native antigens might not be sufficient to obtain complete protection to infection. Nonetheless we showed that non-infectious B. burgdorferi can be an effective carrier to deliver and elicit a specific host response to T. pallidum antigens to assess the efficacy of syphilis vaccine candidates.

AB Background: We report the first-in-concept human trial of the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity when a novel TLR 7/8/RIG 1 agonist RNA-based adjuvant, CV8102, was administered alone or mixed with fractional doses of a licensed rabies vaccine (Rabipur (R)) as model antigen.
   Methods: The primary objective was to assess the safety and reactogenicity of various dose levels of CV8102 alone or mixed with Rabipur (R) in healthy 18-40 year-old male volunteers. A secondary objective was to assess the immune-enhancing potential of bedside-mixes of CV8102 with fractional doses of Rabipur (R) by measuring induction of rabies virus neutralising titres (VNTs).
   Results: Fifty-six volunteers received 50-100 mu g CV8102 alone (n = 11), bedside-mixed CV8102 and Rabipur (R) (n = 20), or Rabipur (R) alone (n = 25; control). When given alone or mixed with Rabipur (R) CV8102 caused mostly Grade 1 or 2 local or systemic reactogenicity, but no related SAEs. As 100 mu g CV8102 was associated with marked CRP increases further dose escalation was stopped. Combining 25-50 mu g of CV8102 with fractional doses of Rabipur (R) significantly improved the kinetics of VNT responses; 50 mu g CV8102 also improved the magnitude of VNT responses to 1/10 Rabipur (R) but caused severe but self-limiting influenza-like symptoms in 2 of 14 subjects.
   Conclusions: Doses of 25 and 50 mu g CV8102 appeared safe and with an acceptable reactogenicity profile while significantly enhancing the immunogenicity of fractional doses of rabies vaccine. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: To fight against enterovirus A71 (EV-A71)-associated diseases, vaccine development was initiated in Taiwan focusing on two-month-old infants.
   Methods: We conducted a phase II, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study on infants and children aged two months to 11 years. This study was conducted in 4 parts (2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d) with age de-escalation sequentially. <Two doses were administered with a 28-day or 56-day interval. Participants aged two months to two years received a booster dose at one year after the first dose. During the surveillance period, solicited adverse events (AEs) and unsolicited AEs were recorded for safety evaluation. Blood samples were collected for neutralising antibody assay at various times. Immune persistence and booster effects were also assessed.
   Results: A total of 363 children completed the study. Most AEs were mild and unrelated to treatment. No vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAES) were reported. Geometric mean titres (GMTs) of serum neutralising antibody titres increased profoundly. Most participants in the vaccine groups achieved defined seroprotection (neutralization titre >= 1:32) after the second vaccination and persisted for two years. Furthermore, the EV-A71 vaccine could provide a cross-reaction against other EV-A71 strain genotypes: B5, C4a, C4b, and C5.
   Conclusions: The mid dose of the EV-A71 vaccine elicited high immune response and were tolerable in participants aged between two months and 11 years in all dosing groups. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: A phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study was conducted in China to assess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RotaTeq (TM), RV5) among Chinese infants. The efficacy and safety data have been previously reported. This report presents the immunogenicity data of the study.
   Methods: 4,040 infants aged 6-12 weeks were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 3 oral doses of RV5 or placebo. Trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV) and diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) were administered in a staggered-use (N = 3,240) or concomitant-use (N = 800) schedule. Immunogenicity of RV5 was evaluated in 800 participants (400 participants from each staggered- and concomitant-use immunogenicity subgroup). Geometric mean titers (GMTs) and seroresponse rates (>= 3-fold rise from baseline to PD3) were measured for anti-rotavirus IgA in the staggered- and concomitant-use subgroups and measured for serum neutralizing antibodies (SNAs) to human rotavirus serotypes G1, G2, G3, G4, PIA[8] in the staggered-use subgroup. Immune responses to tOPV and DTaP coadministered with RV5 were also evaluated in the concomitant-use immunogenicity subgroup. (ClinicalTrials.gov registry: NCT02062385)
   Results: The PD3 GMT and seroresponse rate of anti-rotavirus IgA were higher in the RV5 group (82.42 units/mL, 89.4%) compared to the placebo group (0.33 units/mL, 10.1%). Rotavirus type-specific SNA responses were also higher in the RV5 group compared to the placebo group. In the concomitant-use subgroup, the seroprotection rates of anti-poliovirus type 1, 2, 3 in the participants who received RV5 were non-inferior to those who received placebo, and the antibody responses to DTaP antigens were comparable between the two vaccination groups.
   Conclusions: RV5 was immunogenic in Chinese infants. Immune responses induced by tOPV and DTaP were not affected by the concomitant use of RV5. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The vaccines that are currently available are bacterins, with limited human use, that confer shortterm, serovar-specific immunity. Lig proteins are considered to be the best vaccine candidates to date. Here, we aimed to construct a recombinant Lig chimera (LC) comprised of LigAni and LigBrep fragments, and to evaluate it as subunit or DNA vaccine using different administration strategies. Vaccines were formulated with 50 mu g of recombinant LC associated with different adjuvants or with 100 mu g of pTARGET/LC. Four-week-old hamsters received two doses of vaccine with different strategies and were challenged with 5 x DL50 Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130. The immune response generated by Lig chimera conferred 100% protection to hamsters treated with at least one dose of recombinant LC. Despite the high levels of antibodies that vaccinated animals produced, a sterilizing immunity was not achieved. The lack of a sterilizing immunity could indicate the importance of a mixed humoral and cellular immune response. The present study generated insights that will be useful in the future development of improved subunit vaccines against leptospirosis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Influenza vaccinations play an important role in preventing influenza related hospitalizations. The objective of this study was to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination in protecting Beijing residents aged >= 60 years from influenza related hospitalizations during the 2016/17 and 2017/18 influenza seasons.
   Methods: Patients who met the definition of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and were hospitalized in the nine sentinel hospitals in Beijing during the 2016/17 and 2017/18 influenza seasons were identified as the study population. The vaccination status of patients was obtained from a vaccination registry. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments were conducted to test pharyngeal or lower respiratory tract samples collected from SARI patients for influenza A and B viruses. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was examined using a test-negative design that compare the odds of vaccination among influenza positives and negatives, adjusting for calendar week of illness onset, age, and underlying medical conditions.
   Results: We identified 50,364 patients in the study, in which there were 145 influenza cases and 528 influenza-negative controls aged >= 60 years in 2016/17 season and 149 cases and 358 controls aged >= 60 years in 2017/18 season. The most commonly identified subtype among participants was influenza A(H3N2) in 2016/17 and 2017/18 season (78.5% and 70.6%). Among the adults aged >= 60 years, the adjusted VE of vaccination against any influenza virus for serious acute respiratory infection (SARI) patients was 32.8% (95% confidence interval ICI]: -22.0 to 63.0%) in 2016/17 season. While the adjusted VE in 2017/18 season were 4.6% (95% CI: -72.4 to 47.2%) against any types of influenza, 29.2% (95% CI: -92.9 to 74%) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, -37.7% (95% Cl: -293.8; 51.9%) against influenza A (H3N2) viruses, and 3.6% (95% CI: -113.8 to 56.5%) against influenza B.
   Conclusion: The influenza vaccine provided moderate protection in 2016/17 season and mild protection in 2017/18 season for influenza related inpatients of adults aged >= 60 years in Beijing. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Vaccine coverage is routinely used as a performance indicator for immunization programs both at local and global levels. For many national immunization programs, there are challenges with accurately estimating vaccination coverage based on available data sources, however an increasing number of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have begun implementing electronic immunization registries to replace health facilities' paper-based tools and aggregate reporting systems. These systems allow for more efficient capture and use of routinely reported individual-level data that can be used to calculate dose-specific and cohort vaccination coverage, replacing the commonly used aggregate routine health information system data. With these individual-level data immunization programs have the opportunity to redefine performance measures to enhance programmatic decision-making at all levels of the health system. In this commentary, we discuss how measures for assessing vaccination status and program performance can be redefined and recalculated using these data when generated at the health facility level and the implications of the use and availability of electronic individual-level data.

AB Background: The background incidence of viscerotropic- (VLD) and neurotropic-like disease (NLD) unrelated to immunization in dengue-endemic countries is currently unknown.
   Methods: This retrospective population-based analysis estimated crude and standardized incidences of VLD and NLD in twelve hospitals in Brazil (n = 3), Mexico (n = 3), and Malaysia (n = 6) over a 1-year period before the introduction of the tetravalent dengue vaccine. Catchment areas were estimated using publicly available population census information and administrative data. The denominator population for incidence rates was calculated, and sensitivity analyses assessed the impact of important assumptions.
   Results: Total cases adjudicated as definite VLD were 5, 57, and 56 in Brazil, Mexico, and Malaysia, respectively. Total cases adjudicated as definite NLD were 103, 29, and 26 in Brazil, Mexico, and Malaysia, respectively. Crude incidence rates of cases adjudicated as definite VLD in Brazil, Mexico, and Malaysia were 1.17, 2.60, and 1.48 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. Crude incidence rates of cases adjudicated as definite NLD in Brazil, Mexico, and Malaysia were 4.45, 1.32, and 0.69 per 100,000 person-years, respectively.
   Conclusions: Background incidence estimates of VLD and NLD obtained in Mexico, Brazil, and Malaysia could provide context for cases occurring after the introduction of the tetravalent dengue vaccine. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: A quadrivalent split-virion inactivated influenza vaccine (VaxigripTetre (TM), Sanofi Pasteur; IIV4) containing two A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and B strains from both lineages (Victoria and Yamagata) was approved in Europe in 2016 for individuals aged >= 3 years. This study examined the efficacy and safety of IIV4 in children aged 6-35 months.
   Methods: This was a phase III randomised controlled trial conducted in Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Europe during the Northern Hemisphere 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 and Southern Hemisphere 2014 and 2015 influenza seasons. Healthy children aged 6-35 months not previously vaccinated against influenza were randomised to receive two full doses 28 days apart of IIV4, placebo, the licensed trivalent splitvirion inactivated vaccine (IIV3), an investigational IIV3 containing a B strain from the alternate lineage. The primary objective was to demonstrate efficacy against influenza illness caused by any strain or vaccine-similar strains.
   Results: The study enrolled 5806 participants. Efficacy, assessed in 4980 participants completing the study according to protocol, was demonstrated for IIV4. Vaccine efficacy was 50.98% (97% CI, 37.36-61.86%) against influenza caused by any A or B type and 68.40% (97% CI, 47.07-81.92%) against influenza caused by vaccine-like strains. Safety profiles were similar for IIV4, placebo, and the IIV3s, although injection-site reactions were slightly more frequent for IIV4 than placebo.
   Conclusions: IIV4 was safe and effective for protecting children aged 6-35 months against influenza illness caused by vaccine-similar or any circulating strains. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: A multi-season phase III trial conducted in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres demonstrated the efficacy of a quadrivalent split-virion inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) in children 6-35 months of age.
   Methods: Data collected during the phase III trial were analysed to examine the vaccine efficacy (VE) of IIV4 in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza in age subgroups and to determine the relative risk for IIV4 vs. placebo for severe outcomes, healthcare use, and parental absenteeism from work associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza.
   Results: VE (95% confidence interval [CI]) to prevent laboratory-confirmed influenza due to any A or B strain was 54.76% (40.24-66.03%) for participants aged 6-23 months and 46.91% (23.57-63.53%) for participants aged 24-35 months. VE (95% CI) to prevent laboratory-confirmed influenza due to vaccine-similar strains was 74.51% (53.55-86.91%) for participants aged 6-23 months and 59.78% (19.11-81.25%) for participants aged 24-35 months. Compared to placebo, IIV4 reduced the risk (95% CI) by 31.28% (8.96-89.34%) for acute otitis media, 21.76% (6.46-58.51%) for acute lower respiratory infection, 40.80% (29.62-55.59%) for healthcare medical visits, 29.71% (11.66-67.23%) for parent absenteeism from work, and 39.20% (26.89-56.24%) for antibiotic use.
   Conclusion: In children aged 6-35 months, vaccination with IIV4 reduces severe outcomes of influenza as well as the associated burden for their parents and the healthcare system. In addition, vaccination with IIV4 is effective at preventing against influenza in children aged 6-23 and 24-35 months. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The improvement of immunity to vaccination has historically focused on manipulation of antigen presentation rather than the host. Immune modulation by stimulating specific acupuncture points along the Meridian System has been practiced in Traditional Chinese Medicine. The purpose , of this study was to quantitatively determine whether acupoint vaccination, in which vaccine is administered at an acupuncture point in dogs, has the potential to enhance the immune response.
   A randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare the effectiveness of acupoint vaccination versus a conventional method, based on humoral immune response in dogs given Canine Distemper Vaccine (CDV). One hundred client-owned dogs were admitted to the study with following characteristics: (1) passed a routine physical exam, (2) aged between 1 and 10 years old, (3) had no history of chronic disease, and (4) were not on immunomodulating medications. Dogs were randomly assigned to either the Acupuncture group inoculated at the acupoint Governing Vessel (GV)-14, or to the Control group inoculated conventionally at a non-acupuncture site. Mean changes from Day0 to Day14 of the response to CDV vaccination, measured by serum neutralization (SN) titers with log-transformation for reducing outlier effects, were compared between groups. No significant difference was found between groups in age, weight, or sex (all p >0.2). Both groups had significant increases of CDV SN titer post-vaccination (p < 0.001). The mean increase in Acupuncture group (0.72; SD = 0.79) was significantly greater than that of the Control group (0.36; SD = 0.67); p = 0.019. Inference on percentage of change in raw SN titer data further revealed that the effects in the Acupuncture group was significantly greater than the Control group (242% vs. 83%; p = 0.02).
   This study demonstrated that Acupoint vaccination at GV-14 resulted in a significantly elevated humoral immune response to CDV vaccine compared to Controls, which suggests the potential of acupoint vaccination to enhance the immune response. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Human infections of novel avian influenza A virus (H7N9) emerged in early 2013 and caused about 40% case-fatality through 2017. Therefore, development of influenza H7N9 vaccines is critical for pandemic preparedness. Currently, there are three means of production of commercial influenza vaccines: egg-based, mammalian cell-based, and insect cell-based platforms. The insect cell-based platform has the advantage of high speed in producing recombinant protein. In this study, we evaluate the stability and immunogenicity of two different influenza H7 HA expression constructs generated using the baculovirus system, including membrane-based full-length HA (mH7) and secreted ectodomain-based H7 (sH7). The mH7 construct could form an oligomer-rosette structure and had a high hemagglutinin (HA) titer 8192. In contrast to mH7, the sH7 construct could not form an oligomer-rosette structure and did not have HA titer before cross-linking with anti-His antibody. Thermal stability tests showed that the sH7 and mH7 constructs were unstable at 43 degrees C and 52 degrees C, respectively. In a mice immunization study, the mH7 construct but not the sH7 construct could induce robust HI and neutralizing antibody titers. In conclusion, further development of the mH7 vaccine candidate is desirable. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Synthetic promoters are an attractive alternative for use in mammalian hosts such as CHO cells as they can be designed de novo with user-defined functionalities. In this study, we describe and validate a method for bioprocess- directed design of synthetic promoters utilizing CHO genomic sequence information. We designed promoters with two objective features, (i) constitutive high-level recombinant gene transcription, and (ii) upregulated transcription under mild hypothermia or late-stage culture. CHO genes varying in transcriptional activity were selected based on a comparative analysis of RNA-Seq transcript levels in normal and biphasic cultures in combination with estimates of mRNA half-life from published genome scale datasets. Discrete transcription factor regulatory elements (TFREs) upstream of these genes were informatically identified and functionally screened in vitro to identify a subset of TFREs with the potential to support high activity recombinant gene transcription during biphasic cell culture processes. Two libraries of heterotypic synthetic promoters with varying TFRE combinations were then designed in silico that exhibited a maximal 2.5-fold increase in transcriptional strength over the CMV-IE promoter after transient transfection into host CHO-K1 cells. A subset of synthetic promoters was then used to create stable transfectant pools using CHO-K1 cells under glutamine synthetase selection. Whilst not achieving the maximal 2.5-fold increase in productivity over stable pools harboring the CMV promoter, all stably transfected cells utilizing synthetic promoters exhibited increased reporter production -up to 1.6-fold that of cells employing CMV, both in the presence or absence of intron A immediately downstream of the promoter. The increased productivity of stably transfected cells harboring synthetic promoters was maintained during fed-batch culture, with or without a transition to mild hypothermia at the onset of stationary phase. Our data exemplify that it is important to consider both host cell and intended bioprocess contexts as design criteria in the de novo construction of synthetic genetic parts for mammalian cell engineering.

AB 3, 4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (3, 4-DHPA) is a phenolic acid with strong anti-oxidative activity, showing potential applications in food and pharmaceutical industries. In this study, a 3, 4-DHPA biosynthetic pathway was designed by connecting 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-HPA) biosynthesis with its hydroxylation. The starting strain produced only 46 mg/L of 4-HPA in 48 h. Enhancing the shikimate pathway increased the titer by 19-fold to 923 +/- 57 mg/L. Furthermore, pykA and pykF were disrupted to conserve phosphoenolpyruvate for 4HPA production. With this effort, 4-HPA titer was increased to 1817 +/- 55 mg/L. Introducing the hydroxylase HpaBC into the 4-HPA overproducing strain resulted in 3, 4-DHPA production and the best strain produced 1856 +/- 67 mg/L of 3, 4-DHPA in shake flask cultures. This work reports de novo biosynthesis of 3, 4-DHPA for the first time and provides a promising alternative for sustainable production of this valuable compound.

AB In an effort to isolate novel natural antibiotics, we searched for antibacterial long-chain N-acyl amino acid synthase (NAS) genes from 70,000 soil metagenome clones by Bacillus subtilis-overlaying screening. In an antibacterial cosmid clone, YS92B, a single gene nasYPL was responsible for the production of the Nas. nasYPL was 903 bp long, and the deduced amino acid sequence showed the highest 71% identity with a hypothetical protein from Massilia niastensis. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that NasYPL belongs to Group 1 Nas. Heterologous expression of the same nasYPL gene in Escherichia coli and two Pseudomonas strains (P. putida and P. koreensis) conferred antibacterial activities against Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus subtilis. Mass spectral analysis of the antibacterial fractions identified 7 peaks corresponding to long-chain N-acyl tyrosine, 5 peaks to N-acyl phenylalanine, and 3 peaks to N-acyl leucine (or isoleucine) derivatives linked with 7 fatty acids, indicating enzymatic products derived by NasYPL. Therefore, NasYPL expression by host-specific manner may provide applicable antibacterial characteristics to biotechnologically important Pseudomonas strains.

AB With few exceptions, all currently marketed antibody therapeutics are IgG molecules. One of the reasons that other antibody isotypes are less developed are the difficulties associated with their purification. While commercial chromatography affinity resins, like staphylococcal superantigen-like 7 (SSL7) protein-containing resin, allow purification of IgAs from many animal species, these are not useful for murine IgAs. Because the mouse model is predominantly used for preclinical evaluation of IgA-based therapeutics, there is a need to develop an effective purification method for mouse IgA. Here, we adapted the sequence of a mouse IgA by mutating two amino acid residues in the fragment crystallizable (Fc) sequence to facilitate its purification on SSL7 resin. The mutated IgA Fc (hereafter referred to as IgA*) was then genetically fused to the variable domain of a llama heavy chain-only antibody (VHH) directed against the fusion protein of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), resulting in VHH-IgA*, and transiently produced in infiltrated Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. These plant-produced mouse VHH-IgA* fusions were enriched by SSL7 affinity chromatography and were found to be functional in ELISA and could neutralize RSV in vitro, suggesting no detrimental effect of the mutation on their antigenbinding properties. This approach for the purification of murine IgA will facilitate downstream processing steps when designing innovative murine IgA-based fusions.

AB The aim of this work was the production of bioactive metabolites by submerged fermentation from the fungus Diaporthe schini, followed by their extraction, separation and characterization. Different solvents (methanol, dichloromethane and hexane) were used for the extraction of metabolites from the fermentation broth and the extracts obtained were evaluated by in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activity. The separation and characterization of the extract from the hexane extraction was performed by column chromatography and GC-MS, respectively. The extracts had a great inhibitory action on the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, on the Gram-negative bacteria Enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae and on the fungus Candida krusei. The main metabolites produced were: 13-docosenamide, (Z)-; 2-hexadecene, 3,7,11,15tetramethyl; 9-octadecenamide and 11-octadecenoic acid. Studies related to the antibacterial and antifungal activities of metabolites extracted from microorganisms are found in the literature. However, works about the identification of metabolites produced by submerged fermentation from Diaporthe schini were not found until the present moment. This work is an initial study where the conditions of the process can be optimized by looking for the production of a specific compound and can be a promising source for obtaining new drugs.

AB Over the past decades, Bacillus megaterium has gained significant interest in the biotechnological industry due to its high capacity for protein production. Although many proteins have been expressed efficiently using the optimized xylose inducible system so far, there is a considerable demand for novel promoters with varying activities, particularly for the adjustment of protein levels in multi-enzyme cascades.
   Genome-wide microarray analyses of the industrially important B. megaterium strain MS941 were applied to identify constitutive and growth phase dependent promoters for the expression of heterologous proteins from the early exponential to the early stationary phase of bacterial growth. Fifteen putative promoter elements were selected based on differential gene expression profiles and signal intensities of the generated microarray data. The corresponding promoter activities were evaluated in B. megaterium via ss-galactosidase screening. ss Galactosidase expression levels ranged from 15% to 130% compared to the optimized xylose inducible promoter. Apart from these constitutive promoters we also identified and characterized novel inducible promoters, which were regulated by the addition of arabinose, galactose and the commonly used allolactose analog IPTG. The potential application of the identified promoters for biotechnologically relevant processes was demonstrated by overexpression of the cholesterol oxidase II from Brevibacterium sterolicum, thus obtaining product yields of up to 1.13 g/l/d.
   The provided toolbox of novel promoters offers versatile promoter strengths and will significantly contribute to harmonize protein expression in synthetic metabolic pathways, thereby pushing forward the engineering of B. megaterium as microbial cell factory for the biosynthesis and conversion of valuable compounds.

AB Growth-arrested strategies (e.g. hypothermia and hyperosmolarity) have been widely employed to enhance cellspecific productivity (qP) in mammalian cell culture bioprocess. In addition to enhanced qP, alterations in cell physiology, such as cell size and cell cycle phase, have also attracted extensive attention under growth-arrested conditions. However, to date, very few reports on associations between physiological changes in growth-inhibiting approaches have been published. In this study, we explored associations between the physiological changes of GS-CHO cells in response to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) treatment. In dose response studies, AMP treatment resulted in suppressed proliferation, accumulated S-phase cells, increased cell size and enhanced qP. Subsequently, six GS-CHO clones exhibited the physiological alterations in varying degrees when treated with 7mM AMP. But more importantly, a significant positive correlation between total intracellular protein content and mean electronic volume, an indicator of cell size (P < 0.01) was found, indicating that total intracellular protein was the determining factor in increasing cell size in this growth-arrested strategy. Besides, our results provide additional evidence that treatment with growth-arrested agents may increase cell size; the agent per se did not cause the increased productivity.

AB Seamless modification of the Escherichia coli genome using positive selection /negative selection is widely used in metabolic engineering and functional genome analysis. Some excellent negative selection systems have been reported, of which tetA-sacB and inducible toxins system are prominent. To expand the existing negative selection toolkit, we constructed a new negative selection marker system based on kil gene of lambda prophage. The selection stringency of kil was measured and compared with the most widely used counter-selection gene, sacB, at the lacI, ack, and dbpa loci using different E. coli strains. At all these loci of tested strains, the selection stringency of kil significantly exceeds that of sacB by 2-to 28-fold. When dsDNA fragments were employed for recombination, the efficiency for isolating the correct recombinant of kil was significantly higher than that of sacB. This new negative selection system does not require special media or extended incubation time. However, our system cannot be used in host strains containing temperature-sensitive kil gene. A Red system providing plasmid without kil gene is recommended for use together with our system. Our counter-selection system is expected to be an addition to the engineering arsenal of E. coli.
