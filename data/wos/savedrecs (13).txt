AB Clustering of a group of interval-valued time series of unequal length is often encountered and the key point of this clustering is the distance measure between two interval-valued time series. However, most distance measure methods apply to interval-valued time series of equal length, and another methods applicable to unequal-length ones usually show high computational cost. In order to give a reasonable and efficient distance measure, this paper first proposes a new representation in the form of a sequence of 3-tuples for interval-valued time series. In this representation, fully take into account the time-axis and value-axis information to decrease the loss of information. Meanwhile, this representation is guaranteed to achieve dimensionality reduction. Based on the new representation, dynamic time warping algorithm is then employed and an improved dynamic time warping algorithm is produced. Furthermore, a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on the new proposed distance measure is designed for interval-valued time series of equal or unequal length. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed distance and quantify the performance of the designed clustering method. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Image segmentation is one of the popular tasks in image processing that can be used in several applications. For that, there are several methods have been proposed for image segmentation; in which, these methods aim to minimize or maximize single objective (SO) function to find the optimal threshold to separate the image into the optimal number of regions. While a few of the image segmentation methods consider multi-objective functions which aim to find the optimal solutions that can reduce the conflict among the different objectives. However, these methods have some limitations as decreasing their performance when the number of objectives is increasing. Due to increasing the number of non-dominated solutions, so, there isn't pressure towards the Pareto front. Therefore, this paper proposes an alternative image segmentation method using many-objective optimization (MaOP) algorithms considering seven objective functions. One of the most competitive MaOPs is called the Knee Evolutionary Algorithm (KnEA) which used to find the set of Pareto optimal solutions for seven objective functions to improve the image segmentation. The proposed KnEA is evaluated using a set of six images tested at six different levels of threshold, and its performance is compared with other MaOP methods. The experimental results show that the KnEA method has a better approximation to the optimal Pareto fronts (PFs) than the other MaOPs method in terms of the quality of the segmented image such as the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), the structural similarity index (SSIM), and the computational time. As well as, the quality of PFs is measuring using the hypervolume, coverage and spacing indicators. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To model a home health care planning problem by classical VRP and AP formulation, the dimensions of the problem are: 1. The staff, 2. The patients, 3. The routes (sequence of the patients for each staff member). In this study, we present an extension of the home health care planning problem by adding the extra dimension of time so that the staff are not only assigned to the patients, but they are also assigned to daily periods. The scope of the planning problem extends to multiple days in which the patient required services vary from one day to another. Hence, the problem concerns a sequence of schedules (one schedule for each day) for the staff members. This variant of the home health care planning problem is modeled mathematically by employing the sequencing generalized assignment formulation and solved by applying the Gurobi mixed-integer solver. Considering that the studied combinatorial optimization is NP-complete, a matheuristic approach based on the decomposition of the formulation is proposed in this research to simplify the mathematical model and reduce the computational time needed to solve the problem. The numerical experiences and statistical analysis show that our matheuristic approach solves 90% of the instances to optimality with a significant reduction in the computational times.

AB Cross efficiency evaluation in data envelopment analysis (DEA) is an effective tool for ranking the performance of decision-making units (DMUs). Numerous cross efficiency evaluations have been proposed with different secondary goals using both peer-evaluation and self-evaluation. The neutral cross efficiency evaluation is an important secondary goal in the classical black-boxes DEA models; that is, the internal processes of the DMUs are often ignored in the efficiency evaluation. This study extends the idea of neutral cross evaluation to measure the efficiency of the basic two stage network systems and proposes a new neutral cross efficiency model. The proposed model is able to rank DMUs in sub-stages and decompose the cross efficiency measure of the system into the product of those of the stages. The results from two real-world examples show that the neutral cross efficiency model proposed in this paper can increase the discriminating power of a two-stage system and their sub-stages and can obtain more realistic weight scheme than basic two stage DEA model.

AB Portfolio optimization is the process of determining the best combination of securities and proportions with the aim of having less risk and obtaining more profit in an investment. Utilizing covariance as a risk measure, mean-variance portfolio optimization model has brought a revolutionary approach to quantitative finance. Since then, along with the advancements in computational power and algorithmic enhancements, a lot of efforts have been made on improving this model by considering real-life conditions and solving model variants with various methodologies tested on various data and performance measures. A comprehensive literature review of recent and novel papers is crucial to establish a pattern of the past, and to pave the way on future directions. In this paper, a total of 175 papers published in the last two decades are selected within the scope of operations research community and reviewed in detail. Thus, a comprehensive survey on the deterministic models and applications suggested for mean-variance portfolio optimization in which several variants of this model as well as additional real-life constraints are studied. The review classifies the approaches according to exact and approximate attempts and analyzes the proposed algorithms based on various data and performance indicators in depth.

AB Grid computing, in simplest terms, is distributed computations that have reached higher evolution level. Grid scheduler is part of Grid. Scheduler generates an assignment of jobs to resources using the resource information provided by the Grid information service. Since the problems raised in the resource management system are NP-hard, classical methods, such as dynamic programming, are useful only for small-size problems. Being capable of producing efficient schedules at an acceptable time, even for large samples of the problem, heuristic algorithms are promising methods for solving the scheduling problem. The resource scheduling process in the Grid consists of three main phases: resource discovery, resource selection and job execution. In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on learning automata to resource selection in computational Grid. In this algorithm, decisions are made based on the list of resources that discovered at the resource discovery phase, and after being selected based on predicted time to execution or completion job, they would sent to the next phase namely the execution phase. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through conducting several simulation experiments under different Grid scenarios. The obtained results are compared with several existing methods in terms of the average turn-around time, average response time and throughput. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Social networks provide an attractive environment in order to have low cost and easy communication; however, analyzing huge amounts of produced data can considerably affect the user's privacy. In other words, an efficient algorithm should intelligently take the user's privacy into account while extracting data for useful information. In recent years, many studies have been conducted on social network privacy preservation for data publishing. However, the current algorithms are not one-time scan; that is, for every level of anonymization, the data set must be scanned again and this is a time-consuming operation. In order to address the above mentioned issue, the present research introduces a time-saving k-degree anonymization method in social network (TSRAM) that anonymizes the social network graph without having to rescan the data set for different levels of anonymity. First, it produces a tree from the data set. Then, the anonymized degree sequence of the graph is computed based on the tree. The proposed method employs an efficient approach to partition the node degrees. It takes advantage of partitioning the graph bottom-up nodes based on the anonymization levels. Moreover, it uses two effective criteria to increase the utility of the anonymized graph. Comparing to other similar techniques, the results show that TSRAM is effective, not only to make the degree sequence anonymization of the graph one-time scan, but also to preserve the utility of the anonymized graph.

AB The present paper aims to show the necessity of information augmentation to cope with the natural decrease in information content in multi-layered neural networks. It is natural to make an effort to collect as much information as possible, because it is impossible to know which information is necessary or useful before learning. Thus, the present paper tries to force neural networks to form new network configurations to have as much information as possible, contrary to the conventional approach of information reduction, such as many types of regularization. For information augmentation, we use the self organizing map (SOM), which can over-represent inputs and produce as many similar weights as possible. The method was applied to two data sets: the banknote authentication data set and the character recognition data set. In both experimental results, it was confirmed that redundant and excessive information generation in terms of the excessive number of connection weights was connected with improved generalization.

ID THESAURUS
AB Ontologies are key concepts in the semantic web and have an impressive role which comprise the biggest and the most prominent part of the infrastructure in this realm of web research. By fast growth of the semantic web and also, the variety of its applications, ontology mapping (ontology alignment) has been transformed into a crucial issue in the realm of computer science. Several approaches are introduced for ontology alignment during these last years, but developing more accurate and efficient algorithms and finding new effective techniques and algorithms for this problem is an interesting research area since real-world applications with respect to their more complicated concepts need more efficient algorithms. In this paper, we illustrated a new ontology mapping method based on learning using Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), and show how the ILP can be used to solve the ontology mapping problem. As a matter of fact, in this approach, an ontology which is described in OWL format is interpreted to first-order logic. Then, with the use of learning based on inductive logic, the existing hidden rules and relationships between concepts are discovered and presented. Since the inductive logic has high flexibility in solving problems such as discovering relationships between concepts and links, it also can be performed effectively in solving the ontology alignment problem. Our experimental results show that this technique yield to more accurate results comparing to other matching algorithms and systems, achieving an F-measure of 95.6% and 91% on two well-known reference datasets the Anatomy and the Library, respectively.

AB Multiple objective structural optimization is a challenging problem in which suitable optimization methods are needed to find optimal solutions. Therefore, to answer such problems effectively, a multi-objective modified adaptive symbiotic organisms search (MOMASOS) with two modified phases is planned along with a normal line method as an archiving technique for designing of structures. The proposed algorithm consists of two separate improved phases including adaptive mutualism and modified parasitism phases. The probabilistic nature of mutualism phase of MOSOS lets design variables to have higher exploration and higher exploitation simultaneously. As search advances, a stability between the global search and a local search has a significant effect on the solutions. Therefore, an adaptive mutualism phase is added to the offer MOASOS. Also, the parasitism phase of MOSOS offers over exploration which is a major issue of this phase. The over exploration results in higher computational cost since the majority of the new solutions gets rejected due to inferior objective functional values. In consideration of this issue, the parasitism phase is upgraded to a modified parasitism phase to increase the possibility of getting improved solutions. In addition, the proposed changes are comparatively simple and do not need an extra parameter setting for MOSOS.
   For the truss problems, mass minimization and maximization of nodal deflection are considered as objective functions, elemental stresses are considered as behavior constraints and (discrete) elemental sections are considered as side constraints. Five truss optimization problems validate the applicability of the considered meta-heuristics to solve complex engineering. Also, four constrained benchmark engineering design problems are solved to demonstrate the effectiveness of MOMASOS. The results confirmed that the proposed adaptive mutualism phase and modified parasitism phase with a normal line method as an archiving technique provide superior and competitive results than the former obtained results.

AB Rutile-TiO2 thin films have potential for use in high-k applications, such as dynamic random-access memory capacitors; however, they are difficult to realize without using noble-metal-based oxide substrates. Therefore, we proposed a new approach for the preparation of rutile TiO2 by a small amount of Sn doping and the insertion of ultra-thin SnO2 to achieve enhanced dielectric performance without using noble-metal-based electrodes. It was confirmed that the crystallinity of rutile TiO2 was remarkably enhanced in Sn-doped TiO2 formed on an ultra-thin SnO2 interlayer. Moreover, 10 nm-thick Sn-doped TiO2 thin film on a 1-nm SnO2 interlayer exhibited a high dielectric constant of about 80. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ELECTROMIGRATION FAILURE
AB The resistance variations of Aerosol-Jet printed silver lines in a current-voltage measurement with linear increased voltages are studied. There are four kinds of curves obtained due to the different initial average sheet resistances. The most typical device has both current leap and drop in the whole voltage sweep, and divides the current-voltage characteristics into three regions. The results, which show that Joule heating plays a key role, can be explained using electric sintering and electromigration failure. Characteristics of other devices were also explained subsequently to confirm the findings. All of the fused printed Ag-NPs have similar average sheet resistances, which may be a balanced state between electrical sintering and electromigration. This investigation opens up a better method for understanding the current carrying capacity of Aerosol-Jet printed conductive line with rough surface, narrow width, and high sheet resistance.

AB In this study, an iron-exsolution mullite crystal is defined as a mullite crystal formed form an iron-rich mullite solid solution, wherein the iron ion is ex-dissolved. The samples are prepared using a-alumina, fused-silica, and Fe2O3 powders. The research results demonstrate that after sintering at 1700 degrees C, the Fe3+ ions of the iron-rich mullite solid solution in the closed pores of the sample are reduced to Fe2+ ions under the influence of the reducing atmosphere, resulting in Fe2+ exsolution and the formation of the iron-exsolution mullite. This "solution-exsolution" behavior changes the nucleation rate of the mullite and increases the internal lattice driving force in the iron-rich mullite solid solution with critical solution saturation, significantly promoting anisotropic grain growth along the (0 0 1) direction. As a result, an elongated column mullite crystal is formed, whose morphology is different from that of a spheroidal-shaped iron-rich mullite. The obtained results provide a theoretical foundation for designing the crystal structure of mullite according to the application condition, and indicate the solid-solubility limit of iron in mullite solid solution.

AB While technologically important to maintain porosity, a noninvasive improvement and testing of electrical conductivity of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and their composites, are challenging due to their insulating and fragile nature. A conducting atomic force microscope (C-AFM) was utilized to probe the conductivity of self-assembled MOF on graphene (UiO-66-NH2@G) and compared with conventional 4-point probe method. C-AFM gives 11.8 Sm-1 for the conductivity on a single grain, while an average value of 6.6 x 10(-4) Sm-1 was recorded utilizing the 4-point probe method. The dramatic enhancement of conductivity for the MOF@G composite can be ascribed to delocalization of interfacial states between MOF and graphene. Concurrently, gas sorption, X-ray and FTIR analysis reveal no changes in the overall porosity and the structure of the MOF materials. The combination of bottom up synthesis and testing provides guidelines to enhance conductivity and understand the mechanism of charge transport in otherwise insulating MOF materials.

Ablation of divided target Si/Yb in a flow of Ar resulted in deposits which contained mostly ytterbium silicide nanowires, nanorods and nanoparticles. Single nanoparticles (800 degrees C) are identical with Yb3Si5 alloy; nanorods possess both a monoclinic phase not corresponding to any known structure in the phase diagram Yb-Si and a face-centered cubic structure close to the pure Yb but with a high Si content. At the temperature of 1000 degrees C, the studied nanorods and nanowires decorated by nanocrystals are practically amorphous, whereas the structure of those nanocrystals is close to that of the nanorods with the face-centered cubic structure prepared at 800 degrees C.

AB The effect of carbon nanotube (CNT) purification treatment on the thermal and electrical properties of epoxy nanocomposites was investigated. The results indicated that purification treatment can significantly affect nanocomposite performance including thermal and electrical properties. Highly-purified single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have the potential to significantly improve the thermal conductivity of polymer nanocomposites, but are unfavorable for electrical properties due to their inability to form an effective percolating network. The thermal conductivity can be improved up to four times higher than the polymer matrix, demonstrating the significance of CNT purification treatment in improving nanocomposite performance. The electrical conductivity of polymer nanocomposites is more sensitive to purification treatment than their thermal conductivity. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the present work, grain boundary sliding (GBS) has been studied for the grains exhibiting different orientations (for indentation parallel and perpendicular to < c > axis) at different temperatures (RT to 200 degrees C) using nanoindentation in pure Zn. Electron back scattered diffraction was utilized to determine the orientation of the indented grains and identify the deformation mechanism, whereas atomic force microscopy was utilized to systematically quantify the GBS. Results indicated that indentation perpendicular to < c > axis exhibits slip induced GBS, whereas the indentation parallel to < c > axis results in pure GBS. The amount of GBS was also found to be strongly dependent upon the orientation of the neighboring grain. Further, the contribution from GBS towards total stain was found to increase with an increase in temperature. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Considering the excellent electrical, optical and mechanical properties, ternary boron carbonitride (BCN) have attracted widespread attentions. Herein, we report an effective strategy for synthesis of nanoporous BCN. The morphology, structure and composition, as well as the electrochemical properties were systematically studied. It was found that the nanoporous BCN prepared at 800 degrees C showed the highest specific capacitance (475 F/g) and excellent cycle stability (97.7%) over 3000 cycles. This is mainly due to the larger specific surface area (506.9 m(2)/g) of the product, which can provide more contact area and active site between the electrode material and electrolyte. Compared with pseudocapacitor, the electrode material has better cycle stability and potential application in supercapacitor, which is the typical electric double layer capacitor.

AB Effective control of a fly ash/polymer interface is often hindered by poor compatibility. Advanced surface modification of fly ash by using corrosive microorganisms is proposed in this study. Microbial adhesion and catabolism of corrosive microorganisms resulted in a lipophilic surface and a cellular structure of fly ash, which contribute to the compatibility between fly ash and polymers. The mechanisms of corrosive microorganisms modifying the fly ash were revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Owing to the favorable interface bonding between modified fly ash and rubber, the fluororubber compounds achieved a favorable tensile strength exceeding 10.0 MPa. The reinforcement effect, which was almost identical to that of medium thermal black, indicates that microbial modification can be used to treat fly ash and other similar inorganic particles.

AB C-dots and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have a wide range of applications in the field of photocatalysis. Here, C-dots/UiO-66-NH2 composites were successfully synthesized by a simple one-pot method. The synthesized samples were characterized by XRD, Raman, SEM, TEM, EDS, Mapping, UV-vis DRS, and PL spectra. Compared with UiO-66-NH2, the absorption edge of C-dots/UiO-66-NH2 extended from 439 nm to 534 nm. The experiments of photocatalytic degrading ketoprofen under visible-light irradiation (lambda >= 420 nm) showed that C-dots/UiO-66-NH2 demonstrated stronger photocatalytic activity than UiO-66-NH2 for degrading ketoprofen (1.87 times that of UiO-66-NH2) and degraded 92% in 1 h. The improved photocatalytic activity was mostly caused by the reduced band gap and interfaces between UiO-66-NH2 and C-dots, absorbing more visible light and inhibiting electron-holes recombination.

AB Ag coated vanadium phosphate/carbon (VPO4/C/Ag) was facilely prepared by calcination of mixture of AgNO3, VPO4/C and glucose in inert atmosphere. The SEM and TEM tests demonstrate that Ag nanoparticles are evenly distributed on the surface of VPO4/C. In the voltage range of 0.01-3.0 V, VPO4/C/Ag delivers much better rate capability, higher capacity and better cyclability than VPO4/C, which is ascribed to improvement of electronic conductivity of VPO4/C by introduction of uniformly dispersive Ag nanoparticles.

AB We report on the photocurrent generation in HfO2-carbon nanotube (CNT) nanocomposites under Ultra-Violet (UV) and visible excitations at zero bias. Cubic phase HfO2 nanoparticles have been combined with multi-walled carbon nanotubes in this work. The cubic phase of HfO2 has been stabilized by oxygen vacancies which act as luminescent band gap states. In a broad UV-visible range of below band gap photoexcitation, a photocurrent is generated which was found to be most efficient under UV illumination. We discuss the possible mechanism in terms of a CNT assisted charge transfer involving optically active surface states of the HfO2 nanoparticles. The abrupt generation and relaxation responses of the photocurrent on/off cycles along with a constant steady state current as high as 200 nA for 1 mg of the nanocomposite, has potential in energy harvesting and other applications requiring stable charge retention.

On applying the load, it shows the elastic and plastic behavior. The work done during the elastic and plastic processes are 16,757 +/- 120 mu N.nm and 10,045 +/- 120 mu N.nm, respectively. The estimated values of reduced modulus and hardness are 158 +/- 8 GPa and 10.5 +/- 2 GPa, respectively. This suggests that this compound exhibits a significant plastic character.

AB One-directional alignment of Ag nanowires (AgNWs) embedded in silica matrix was achieved by means of the sol-gel fabrication process by stirring the precursor solution consisting of tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) and AgNW during gelation. The parallel orientation of AgNWs along the stirring direction was confirmed in the sliced composite by optical microscopy. The optical function of the obtained composite as polarizer was demonstrated by transmission measurement with polarized light. The polarization response was found to be limited and can be explained with the buckling of AgNWs formed during the condensation reaction. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Both the results of DC and AC magnetic measurements have been analyzed. The zero field cooling and field cooling curves show obvious divergence at low temperatures in low applied magnetic field, which originates from the anisotropy of CrXTe3 (X = Si, Ge) single crystals.

The as-obtained Ni-Mo-S/MoOx/NF presents high electrocatalytic activity and excellent durability for HER in 1 M KOH. More specifically, the as-obtained sample requires an overpotential of only 180 mV to attain the current density of 50 mA cm (2), with remarkable stability for 50 h. The good performance of the Ni-Mo-S/MoOx/NF electrocatalyst can be attributed to its high conductivity and unique structural features. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The incorporation of the nanocrystals into BC membranes led to a more dense and compacted structure with smoother surface, improving both, the oxygen barrier properties due to the tortuous path created by the BCNCs, and the mechanical performance. This simple and practical method provides a new approach to make stiff nanopapers fully derived from BC with potential applications in eco-friendly packaging. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Janus fabric with directional water transport has attracted much attention in scientific and industrial communities. However, limited knowledge is available regarding combining a commercial woven fabric and an electrospun nonwoven fabric to prepare Janus fabric and the effect of asymmetric wettability on its directional water transport properties. Herein, we prepared two types of Janus fabric by depositing different thicknesses of polystyrene (PS) layers on the hydrophilic polyester fabrics (100 mu m) and by depositing the same thickness of PS layer (6.0 mu m) on different hydrophilic polyester fabrics. The Janus fabrics showed directional water transport features when the PS layer thickness was between 3.0 and 12.0 mu m. On hydrophilic polyester, the fabric exhibited directional water transport and the penetration time of water decreased with increasing hydrophobicity. These novel results may be useful for designing and developing "smart" textiles with directional water transport properties for various applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Controlling the structure and morphology of multi-component composites has received extensive attention in the application based on microwave absorption. In this work, ternary complex Fe3O4@C@MoS2 was prepared with Fe3O4@C as core and the flake MoS2 as the shell. The composition, morphology, and structure of those composites were investigated. The related electromagnetic parameters of the asprepared absorber were calculated and processed to explore the store and lose ability toward to the electromagnetic wave energy. Results showed that the maximum reflection loss (RL) of the Fe3O4@C@MoS2 cloud reach -51.6 dB, and the effective absorption bandwidth (RL <= -10 dB) was 6.2 GHz (9.4-15.6 GHz), corresponding to a low loading mass of 20%. These excellent electromagnetic wave absorption properties may be attributed to the synergetic effects between the hierarchical structure and multiple component effects, which significantly enhanced the attenuation behavior.

AB Iron monophosphide (FeP) anode, with high theoretical capacity and available resources applied in advanced lithium ion batteries, is faced with the challenge of dramatic volume expansion during cycling. Here, a novel 3D graphene framework scaffolded FeP nanoparticles composite was designed and fabricated via a facial three-step method. 3D FeP-rGO anode delivers an unprecedented rate performance (458 mA h g(-1) at 10 A g(-1)) and excellent long cycling performance (448 mA h g(-1) at the high current density of 3 A g(-1) over 500 cycles). More impressively, the full cell consisting of 3D FeP-rGO anode and LiFePO4 cathode shows a stable Li+ storage performance with a high capacity retention of 97% (373 mA h g(-1)) at 0.5 A g(-1) after 120 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the special hierarchical 3D graphene framework of composite that can provide abundant channels to facilitate the rapid Li+ diffusion and accommodate the volume change during cycling.

AB Designing metallic materials with controllable soft/hard laminates is always desired for scientists and engineers, which can effectively achieve superior mechanical properties. In current work, two kinds of novel techniques were firstly proposed to fabricate soft/hard laminates for single metals and alloys. The one is that processing coarse-grained sheets into soft/hard laminates by local deformation. The other technique is that processing deformed sheets into soft/hard laminates by local heating. In addition, these mentioned techniques also have been simply compared and discussed with each other from a scientific and technological point of view, which may give a significant guidance for scientific research and industrial application.

The DMF was identified to be a promising candidate as it facilitated reduction in the inclusions. The powder Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) measurements performed on BNA polycrystalline samples revealed that their efficiencies were about 8.4 and 2.3 times higher than KDP and Urea samples respectively.

AB A facile approach to fabricate arranged TiO2 nanofibers via electrospinning and sintering is investigated in this paper. We have successfully demonstrated the electrospun TiO2 nanofibers transited from anatase to rutile phase with the increase of sintering temperature. Meanwhile, the TiO2 nanofibers with a mixed crystalline structure displayed better transistor characteristics and enhanced electrical property as building block in a top-gate field-effect transistor (FET) devices, compared to the pure anatase and rutile phase of TiO2 nanofibers.

AB Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) is one of the proven transition metal oxides to boost up the work function of graphene. In this letter, we report for the first time the use of MoO3 based dielectric/metal/dielectric (DMD) multilayer coating to improve the photovoltaic performance of graphene/silicon solar cells. Solar cells employing transparent conductive MoO3/Ag/MoO3 on graphene offered improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) by a factor of 4 compared to graphene only devices. This strategy appears advantageous not only to modulate the work function of graphene but also to reduce the device series resistance for better charge carrier extraction. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, well-crystallized walnut-shaped BiFeO3 microspheres have been successfully synthesized via a facile hydrothermal process. Meanwhile, the morphology growth process of walnut-shaped microspheres was investigated. The gas sensing properties of fabricated sensor based on BiFeO3 microspheres to different gases concluding formaldehyde, acetic acid, acetone and ethanol etc. were systematically studied. The results revealed that at the optimum operating temperature of 240 degrees C, the gas sensor exhibited typical p-type semiconductor gas sensing behavior concluding high response value, good repeatability and fast response/recovery time to formaldehyde, which also provides an experimental basis for bismuth ferrite to become a new multi-metal oxide semiconductor gas sensing materials in the future.

AB The nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) were synthesized on silicon substrates by a hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) method with varying hydrogen plasma etching time. The hydrogen etching effect on the characteristics of current-voltage, capacitance-frequency and dielectric loss-frequency have been studied. It was founded that the dark current decreased with the etching time. The dielectric properties based on NCDs can be improved with the increasing in etching time, indicating sample with 3 h hydrogen etching exhibited dielectric constant closed to intrinsic diamond and low dielectric loss. The hydrogen etching treatment can provide a feasible approach to enhance the dielectric property of NCD. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Precipitation evolution of pre-deformed Mg-5Sm-1.4Nd-0.4Zn-0.5Zr alloy during aging at 200 degrees C was investigated by using high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). A long lamellae beta(B)' phase was found in the pre-deformed alloy. The beta(B)' phase has a disordered hexagonal structure, and the closely packed planes in beta(B)' have the ABCA stacking sequence with Sm, Nd and Zn atoms in B and C planes. The beta(B)' precipitating on basal plane and beta'/beta(1) precipitating on prismatic plane form an enclosed structure. This special structure has a stronger impeding effect on dislocations slip. The precipitation sequence of the pre-deformed Mg-5Sm-1.4Nd-0.4Zn-0.5Zr alloy is: supersaturated solid solution -> Guinier Preston (G.P.) zones -> beta(B)'/beta' -> beta(1) -> beta. The age-hardening response of the Mg-Sm-Nd-Zn-Zr alloy is enhanced significantly by pre-deformation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main objective is to evaluate their influence in the ablation mechanism using the Direct Laser Interference Patterning method. Using a 10 ps infrared laser system operating with low and high fluence levels and different pulse overlaps, a lower efficiency in the ablation process was observed for the low energy case, while at high fluences an improvement of the ablation efficiency up to 31% was observed.

Coarse grains and acicular Al11RE3 phases in Mg-4Al-5RE alloy are successfully refined by the addition of 0.66 wt% Gd. The average grain size is dramatically decreased from 493.9 mu m to 205.8 mu m, and the acicular Al11RE3 phase is modified to rod-like sharp with a pronouncedly decreased average length from 22.0 mu m to 3.8 mu m. The modified microstructures are attributed to the formation of Al-2(Gd, RE) particles, which act as nucleation sites for both alpha-Mg and Al11RE3. Eventually, the modified alloy exhibits dramatically enhanced yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation (EL) about 12%, 23% and 48%, respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB We have reported for the first time the synthesis of mixed anatase and rutile TiO2 under 27 MPa in water at the temperature as low as 375 degrees C. XRD patterns show that the content of rutile in the mixed phase TiO2 is increased by 47.7% compared with the raw TiO2. The average particle size of the mixed phase TiO2 is increased obviously compared with the raw TiO2. Compared with that of the raw TiO2, the band gap of the mixed phase TiO2 is reduced to 2.94 eV while the absorbance is enhanced. Although the particle size increases, the mixed phase TiO2 still exhibits better photocatalytic performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ELECTROLYTES
AB Imidazoliums are commonly used ionic liquid cations in electrolyte in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Here, the size effects of imidazolium cations bearing the cyanoethyl group on DSSC performance have been systematically investigated by introducing the different alkyl chains (C1-C12), by which size control is allowed in a range of 9-20 angstrom. The large cations slow down electron recombination and ion diffusion, but, unexpectedly, they suppress downward shift of TiO2 conduction band significantly affecting on electron injection process. While all the cations used in this work demonstrate a better power conversion efficiency than that for the common imidazolium analogue, the interplay among the key processes results in the best performance with the medium-sized cation C4 (11 angstrom). This work paves a way for design of efficient electrolyte cations for photovoltaic devices. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon-coated flower-like MoO3-NiO microspheres (FL-MNO@C) are successfully synthesized by a facile two-step method, which involves a citric-assisted hydrothermal self-assembly process followed by an amorphous carbon coverage process. The monodispersed flower-like microspheres are composed of loosely stacked nanosheets with a thickness of similar to 50 nm, in which MoO3 and NiO nanoparticles are dispersed homogenously. As anode material for lithium ion batteries, the electrode exhibits a capacity of 944 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) up to 100 cycles, and even retains a reversible capacity of 481 mAh g(-1) at 2000 mA g(-1) after 2000 cycles. The features of good electrochemical performance and easy to mass production make the FL-MNO@C composite potential candidate as high performance anode material for practical application in lithium-ion batteries.

AB The shuttle effect from the dissoluble polyselenide intermediates in lithium-selenium (Li-Se) battery is a critical problem. In order to explore the effective solution, a specific composite ceramic separator including a covalent organic framework prepared by the polymerization of 2,5-Dimethoxy-1,4-Dicarboxaldeh yde and Tetrakis(4-aminophenyl) ethane (DMTA-COF) was used to enhance electrochemical performance of Li-Se battery for the first time. It should be noted that the cathode with pure selenium of 80% by weight leads to a high selenium loading of similar to 3 mg/cm(2) for the simply-made cells. Due to the small pore channel of the DMTA-COF-coated separator, the dissolution of the polyselenide LiSen (n > 4) can be effectively restrained. As a consequence, the cells delivered a long cycling performance of up to 700 cycles with high capacity of 126 mA h/g at 6 C and good capacity of 51 mA h/g at 20 C. Obviously, our study elucidates the COF-integrated separator is a promising pathway to improve the capacity and stability of the lithiumselenium battery. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tetragonal Fe2TeO6 (FTO) was successfully synthesized via simple calcination method and evaluated as anode materials of alkali-ion (lithium and sodium ion) batteries for the first time. Its physical properties were investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission microscopy. Its electrochemical characteristics were studied via cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge. The FTO materials exhibit excellent electrochemical performance in LIBs and SIBs. It can deliver a high reversible volumetric capacity of 1901.5 mA h cm(-3) at 100 mA g(-1) after 500 cycles as the anode of lithium-ion batteries. Furthermore, FTO shows impressive performance at higher current density. It maintains a discharge capacity of over 311.7 mA h cm(-3) even at a current density of 2000 mA g(-1). In addition, it also can deliver a discharge capacity of 574.9 mA h cm(-3) after 500 cycles at 100 mA g(-1) as the anode materials of sodium-ion batteries. These results indicate that FTO is a potential anode material for lithium ion and sodium ion batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To overcome the limitation of minority carrier diffusion length and high recombination of electron-hole pairs, porous ultrathin tungsten trioxide (WO3) nanoplate arrays with amorphous layer were prepared by one-step hydrothermal method without pre-seeded which possessed the highest photocurrent density of 1.80 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs RHE and 100 mV cathodic shift of onset potential with 0.20 g dosage of (NH4)(2)C2O4. The remarkable photoelectrochemical performance mainly benefits from enhanced red-shift light absorption, cathodic shifted onset potential, lowest recombination of photoelectron-hole pairs and abundant active surface areas. These results confirm that engineering the thickness and surface state of oxide semiconductor nanoplate arrays are the promising ways to improve the photoelectrochemical performance for solar water splitting.

AB A heat-treatment-assisted approach towards scalable synthesis of mesoporous carbons by direct solid-solid mixing of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and nano-sized SiO2, subsequent pyrolysis and SiO2 removal process, was reported in this study. The obtained mesoporous carbon presented a well-defined mesopore structure with high surface area and large mesopore size. During synthesis, MCC underwent structural relaxation process before degradation, which could provide a capillarity condensation force inducing the imprint of mesopore on final carbons. Due to the proper structure, the as-prepared mesoporous carbon showed prominent performance as sulfur host for lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery, exhibiting a high reversible capacity of 860 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C after 200 cycles, and exceptional rate capability with 600 mA h g(-1) at 5.0 C.

AB At present, the chemical co-precipitation dominates the synthesis pathway of LiNiO2-based cathode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Compared with conventional co-precipitation method, advanced functional powder materials synthesized by solvothermal method exhibit fine grain size, higher crystallinity and integrity. In this work, the uniformly dispersed nickel-cobalt microsphere precursor with porous structure and fine size is prepared by solvothermal routine without any template. Subsequently, the LiNi0.88Co0.12O2 is synthesized by high-temperature solid-state method. The feasibility of LiNi0.88Co0.12O2 as high-performance cathode material for LIBs is explored. As a result, the as-synthesized LiNi0.88Co0.12O2 shows excellent high-rate cyclability due to the fine size and particles integrity inherited from nickel-cobalt microsphere precursor. This study reveals that solvothermal routine is a prospective method for synthesizing new formula LiNiO2-based cathode material. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The high-temperature wear properties of the gradient microstructure formed by ultrasonic impact treatment (UIT) on the surface of low-carbon steel are investigated. The dominant wear mechanism of the sample is oxidation wear and adhesive wear as the temperature increased from 300 degrees C to 500 degrees C. The wear mechanism of the sample changed from abrasive wear to fatigue wear as the applied load increased from 15 N to 95 N. The improvement in the high-temperature wear properties is due to the gradient nanocrystallization, which is helpful for forming an oxide film during wearing. As well as due to presence of the grain boundary wetting phase transitions of cementite, which can effectively delay the crack initiation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The development of a bone tissue engineering scaffold with a biologically active surface for fast bone cell adhesion, proliferation, and extracellular matrix mineralization has been hotly pursued in recent years. However, most substrate materials do not show enough biological activity. Here, polydopamine-assisted immobilization of strontium (Sr) endows a three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide/polypyrrole (3D rGO/PPY) composite scaffold with higher bioactivity. Compared to the bare 3D rGO/PPY scaffold, 3D rGO/PPY modified with Sr (3D rGO/PPY/PDA/Sr) has a higher surface roughness. Moreover, benefiting from the introduction of Sr, the 3D rGO/PPY/PDA/Sr scaffold can significantly enhance early adhesion and proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells on the 2nd day of culture. Additionally, ALP activity and extracellular matrix mineralization are distinctly enhanced. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A TiNbTa0.5ZrAl0.5 refractory high entropy alloy was prepared by powder metallurgy and subsequently subjected to hot forging and annealing. Precipitation behavior and mechanical properties of the hot-worked TiNbTa0.5ZrAl0.5 alloy were investigated. Results show that the hot forging leads to a formation of (Zr, Al)-rich HCP precipitates in the initial BCC matrix. The precipitates have significant strengthening effect on the TiNbTa0.5ZrAl0.5 alloy after annealing at 1000 degrees C for 2 h. Owing to the precipitation strengthening, the hot-worked TiNbTa0.5ZrAl0.5 alloy exhibits a high compressive yield strength of 1740 MPa with a compressive stain of 20%. It is interesting that annealing at lower or higher temperatures than 1000 degrees C causes a degradation in compression properties, mainly due to the decomposition of the BCC matrix and the coarsening of the HCP precipitates.

AB Cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)(2)) nanostructures were prepared on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates via an inexpensive and simple wet-chemical method. At a growth temperature of 60 degrees C, heterogeneous nucleation caused the nanowire-net structured Co(OH)(2) to form a compact bottom layer on the surface of FTO substrate, and homogeneous nucleation resulted in the growth of a porous nanowire-net layer in the solution as the top layer. At 90 degrees C, vertically well-aligned Co(OH)(2) nanosheets were grown from the heterogeneous nucleation on the surface of FTO substrate. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) revealed that the entirely binder-free Co(OH)(2) prepared at 60 degrees C had a high capacitance of 254F/g (38.08 mF/cm(2)) at a scan rate of 2 mV/s and good rate capability compared to the nanosheet-structured Co(OH)(2) prepared at 90 degrees C. Furthermore, it had excellent long-term electrochemical stability of similar to 97% after 1000 cycles at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. These results suggested that the nanowire-net structured Co(OH)(2) had significant application potential in the field of energy storage. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB New basic catalysts were produced by alkali activation of mesoporous MgCO3 using KOH. A crystalline MgO was obtained when the pure amorphous carbonate was heat-treated at 800 degrees C, meanwhile a material formed by a mixture of crystalline structures containing K and Mg was obtained when 50 wt% KOH was added to the mesoporous carbonate before heating. The solid reordering was confirmed by XRD, FTIR and N-2 adsorption-desorption porosimetry measurements. The catalytic activity of the samples was tested for the transesterification of sunflower oil with methanol for FAME production. The reactions were carried out at 65 degrees C, with a methanol: oil weight ratio of 3:10 and a catalyst concentration of 3 wt% referred to the oil weight. The original mesoporous carbonate showed no catalytic activity, while the MgO obtained by MgCO3 heating reached 45% conversion after 15 h of reaction time. Interesting results were obtained using the K-doped sample, which attained 98% oil conversion in 30 min. The K catalyst was recovered and reused, giving 50% oil conversion after 120 min of reaction time. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID MICRO-SUPERCAPACITORS
AB The rapid development of portable and miniaturized electronic devices has promoted the demand for on-chip energy storage devices. Because of the long cyclic lifetime and high power density, microsupercapacitors have great potential to be the alternative of microbatteries in various applications. Conductive nanofibers with large surface area and excellent electron conductive matrix render itself a feasible electrode material for microsupercapacitors. However, the conventional preparation process is energy consumption and time-consuming. Herein, we demonstrate a new method to fabricate conductive nanofibers-based microsupercapacitors (CNFs-MSCs) by employing the electrospinning of nanofibers on Au-coated glass substrate followed by direct laser writing. The fabricated CNFs-MSCs have an initial areal capacitance of 4 mF cm(-2) and outstanding cycling stability with a retention of 180% after 7600 cycles. This superior electrochemical performance indicates that the fabricated devices have greatly promising potential for smart energy storage devices. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Cd-doped TiO2; DSSCs; Photoanode; Electrospinning; Nanofibers
AB Cd-doping and nanofibrous morphology are proposed to improve the TiO2 performance as photoanode in the dye-sensitized solar cells. Practical results indicate that Cd ions interfered with the crystalline structure of TiO2 nanofibers, causing an increase in the absorption in the visible spectrum, transport of the charges, and reduced re-bonding between the charge carriers in the barrier area between the electrolyte and the working electrode, compared to the un-doped titania nanofibers. It is interesting that a DSSC based on a Cd-doped TiO2 nanofiber working electrode has a double power conversion efficiency (2.945%) compared with the pristine titanium oxide nanofibers-based cell; 1.54%.

Mn3O4 nano-octahedrons are with length of 350-400 nm and smooth surfaces. The sodium citrate (C6H5Na3O7) played a very important role in the formation of the nanostructures. A possible formation mechanism was proposed in detail. Furthermore, the Mn3O4 nano-octahedrons showed excellent ethanol gas-sensing properties. It is hoped that this study would help to further understand the synthesis and growth mechanism of other manganese oxide nanostructures. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Bi2S3/1T@2H-MoS2 composite photocatalyst was designed by a simple and safe microwave hydrothermal synthesis method. 1T@2H-MoS2 enhance the catalytic performance of Bi2S3 by double-sided coordination as an electron hole inhibitor and a cocatalyst. The composite photocatalyst possesses a broad photo-absorption band and exhibits a significant enhancement in the 400-800 nm region. Compared with bare Bi2S3, the Bi2S3/1T@2H-MoS2 composite exhibits significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity for Cr(VI) and methylene blue (MB) degradation under visible light irradiation. This study shows that the introduction of 1T and 2H MoS2 in a semiconductor photocatalyst is a good strategy for optimizing photocatalytic performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel LED-light-active N-doped BiOIO3 was synthesized successfully by calcination treatment of the mixture of BiOIO3 and urea. It gave a fairly easy way to coordinate the control of bandgap engineering. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the incorporation of nitrogen into the BiOIO3. In UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (UV-vis), photocurrent-time measurement (PT) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the N-doped BiOIO3 exhibits enhanced visible-light absorption and improved photocurrent response compared to pure-BiOIO3. The photocatalytic activity of the samples was evaluated via photodegradation of rhodamine B (RhB), bisphenol A (BPA), tetracycline (TC) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) under LED light irradiation. The N-doped BiOIO3 showed higher photocatalytic activity than pure BiOIO3. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Surfaces with fluid repellency are of great interest for a plethora of applications and introduction of the concept of wettability contrast has further expanded their application domain. Myriad of fabrication techniques are known to prepare superhydrophobic surfaces, however, for generating wettability contrast on a substrate comparatively very few methods are available. A preponderance of these methods involves intricate procedures and sophisticated instrumentation, making them not suitable for up-scaling. In this report, we have used a facile, eco-friendly and solvent-less egg-based approach for fabricating copper surfaces with wettability contrast. This multifaceted method is successfully utilized to design substrates suitable for different applications such as drop manipulation, directional fluid transport, and fog harvesting.

AB The use of food dyes in meat is subject to regulations, due to food safety concerns.
   A reliable method for the determination of 12 food dyes (Amaranth, Ponceau 4R, Carmine, Ponceau SX, Ponceau 3R, Allura Red AC, Carmoisine, Erythrosine, Sudan I, Sudan II, Sudan III and Sudan IV) in meat products using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to UV-diode array detection was developed, optimized and fully validated.
   The extraction was accomplished using acetonitrile, methanol, water, ammonia, 50:40:9:1 (v/v/v/v) as the solvent, and an ultrasonic bath. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a C-18 RP column and samples eluted with a gradient acetate-acetonitrile mobile phase.
   Good analytical performance was obtained, in terms of selectivity, sensitivity, accuracy and ruggedness. Both method precision (CV% range: 6.2%-18.0%) and recovery (range: 86.4%-105.0%) complied with Decision 657/2002/EC, suggesting the procedure could be applied successfully for analyses of meat products in the European Union.

AB Sweet cherries rapidly depreciate in market value owing to decay and the quick loss of fruit quality after harvest. Therefore, optimum postharvest treatment is crucial for maintaining the qualities of cherries during storage. Here, we tested a new method of postharvest treatment by immersing sweet cherries in nitric oxide-releasing chitosan nanoparticles (GSNO-CS NPs), storing them at 0 degrees C and evaluating fruit quality over time. The results indicated that GSNO-CS NPs more effectively preserved the quality of cherries during cold storage compared to other methods. Specifically, GSNO-CS NPs reduced fruit weight loss, respiration rate and ethylene production and increased soluble solids content. Additionally, GSNO-CS NPs reduced reactive oxygen species, increased the antioxidant enzyme activity in direct and indirect antioxidant systems, and increased the levels of ascorbic acid and reduced glutathione. Overall, results suggest that treatment with GSNO-CS NPs can effectively preserve the quality of cherries and enhance antioxidant capacity during cold storage.

AB The effects of high pressure processing on the binding interactions of alpha-lactalbumin and pelargonidin-3-glucoside were studied using the fluorescence quenching, molecular dynamic simulation and molecular docking analysis. The results of fluorescence quenching indicated that the high pressure processing significantly increased the quenching constants of alpha-lactalbumin at pH 7.4 and pH 8.0. The accessible fraction at pH 8.0 was significantly increased, while the fractions at pH 6.0 and pH 7.4 were increased without significant difference. Molecular dynamic simulation and docking results demonstrated that the coil structures and locations, and the residues structures in the binding site of alpha-lactalbumin were affected, the binding site was the typical binding site of calcium ion and not changed during the processing. The dissociation constant of histidine residues was in the range of 6.13 to 6.83, the charge on the residues increased when pH value increased, affected the binding interactions and caused the quenching constant difference.

AB This study tested the potential of high-pressure homogenization (HPH, 69 MPa) combined with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, at 0, 40, 80, 160 and 320 mu mol/g protein) on enhancing the stability of myofibrillar protein (MP, 15 mg/mL) against thermal aggregation (95 degrees C for 10 min) in aqueous solution. The addition of H2O2 blocked the sulfhydryl (SH) groups, inhibited the formation of disulfide bonds, and suppressed thermal aggregation of MP. HPH facilitated the blockage effect of H2O2 by disrupting the intact myofibril structure and exposing buried - SH groups, and this resultedin stronger inhibition of thermal aggregation therefore improved solubility of MP. More than 75% of heated MP remained soluble after the treatment with HPH and 160 mu mol/g H2O2, while untreated samples formed a gel upon heating. These results proved that HPH combined with H2O2 is an effective strategy to promote heat stability of MP in the development of muscle protein-based beverages.

AB Biopolymers used for food contact materials must be evaluated in order to ensure food safety and quality. In this work, the aroma profile of starch-based packaging materials, presented as pellets and films has been characterized. Headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) technique and gas chromatography coupled to both mass spectrometry and a sniffing port (GC-MS-O) were used for identification. In total, 35 odorant compounds were detected. The results showed that aldehydes were the odorants with the highest aromatic impact in starch-based films. Eight odorant compounds, such as trimethylamine, 1-octen-3-one, sotolon, (Z) and (E)-2-nonenal, p-vinylguaiacol, eugenol and 1-undecanol, defined as aroma-impact compounds, obtained modified frequency values (MF%) above 60% in at least 3 out of 4 films. A sensory panel evaluated the toasted, sweet/fruity, green, flower, distasteful, fat and spices notes in the films and it was observed that the quality of all samples decreased when the toasted and spices notes increased.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of tocopherol, rosemary essential oil and ferulago on oxidative stability of mayonnaise during storage. Their efficacy was also compared with tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) and the control group. During the primary oxidation stage, tocopherol was more efficient than TBHQ, while in the secondary oxidation stage it was the same as other antioxidants. At end of storage, samples with added rosemary essential oil and ferulago extract showed peroxide value (2.29 and 2.80 meq O-2/kg oil), anisidine value (11.83 and 12.23), hexanal and heptanal concentration (510.2, 589.9 and 76.6, 75.2 ng/g), respectively, which were meaningfully less than those of the control sample (10.44 meq O-2/kg, 18.32, 1339.8 ng/g, and 225.5 ng/g, respectively). Based on the overall results, tocopherol and rosemary essential oil can be recommended as replacement for TBHQ. However, further evaluation needs to be performed on the organoleptic properties of Ferulago extract.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of selected types of LED (light emitting diodes) lighting on the quality of alfalfa sprouts. In the experiment, cold white, warm white and multicolour: (red, green, blue-RGB) LEDs were applied, and dispersed sunlight was used as a control. The product was examined for the yield and the contents of dry matter, total polyphenols, ascorbic acid, chlorophylls, beta-carotene, lutein, neoxanthin and violaxanthin. Cotyledons' mass in the whole plant increased under LED illumination and was up to 50% greater for sprouts grown in RGB light compared to those cultivated in dispersed sunlight. The highest chlorophyll and carotenoid pigment contents in cotyledons were observed under RGB LED and cold white treatments. Similarly, RGB LEDs allows one to obtain the product with the highest level of total phenolic compounds. The highest ascorbic acid content was observed in sprouts growing under sunlight, followed by RGB.

AB This study aimed to optimize the pigment extraction process for coffee exocarp and to evaluate its coloring effect on French meringue. The anthocyanins were determined with the differential pH method and the process was optimized with the response surface methodology. The solvent concentration (SC) and solid solvent ratio (SSR) had a significant effect on the anthocyanin content and surface color of the coffee cherry extracts. The optimal extraction conditions 60% SC and 25% SSR resulted in the highest concentration of anthocyanins (0.145 mg cyanidin 3-glucoside/g of coffee fresh exocarp). For the French meringue, the 3% extract concentration had the smallest total color difference (Delta E), as compared to the control, evidencing the potential of coffee exocarp dyes in place of synthetic dyes in the manufacture of French meringue.

AB The efficacy against oxidative degradation in model and sulphite-free white wines of two commercial, insoluble chitosans (one being approved for winemaking) were investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Both compounds at various doses significantly inhibited the formation of alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-t-butylnitrone (4-POBN)-1-hydroxyethyl adducts under normal wine storage conditions. Pre-incubation with 2 g/L chitosan followed by filtration had a better effect than adding 50 mg/L sulphur dioxide to the experimental Chardonnay wine on the release of 4-POBN adducts after 6 days of incubation with 100 mu M iron(II). In a relevant photo-oxidative system acetaldehyde formation was significantly reduced after 6 days of incubation. Parallel EPR tests were performed to assess the importance of metal chelation (iron and copper) versus direct scavenging of hydroxyl radicals on the effect of chitosan. The present data support the potentiality of using biocompatible chitosan as a healthier complement and/or alternative to sulphur dioxide against white wine oxidative spoilage.

AB Based on QuEChERS dispersed purification, Fe3O4 nanoparticle decoloration and UHPLC-MS/MS, a robust and sensitive method was established for simultaneous analysis of 14 heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) and acrylamide (AA) in coffee products. Sample was extracted by 90% acetonitrile water (v/v), dispersed with primary secondary amine (PSA) and further purified with Fe3O4 nanoparticle. Then, 15 analytes were detected using ESI positive ion under MRM mode. Good linearity was observed for all analytes in the range of 0.2-100 mu g/L with the determination coefficients being above 0.996. Limits of detection (S/N >= 3) and limits of quantification (S/N >= 10) were in the range of 0.02-0.15 mu g/L and 0.2-0.7 mu g/L, respectively. The intra-day average recoveries were between 81.6% and 100%, and the intra-day precisions ranged from 4.3% to 9.0%. The inter-day average recoveries were in the range of 81.0-101% with precisions ranging from 5.0% to 7.8%. Results indicated that the combination of PSA and Fe3O4 exhibited superior purification and adsorption effects for removing pigments and acid compounds. Real samples analysis indicated that coffee products were widely contaminated with AA, harman and norharman.

AB Different formulations and crystallising conditions were employed to vary the bulk phase structuring of oleogels. The oleogels were formed only at monoacylglycerol: native phytosterol (MAG:NPS) ratios of 10:0, 7:3 and 5:5. NPS co-crystallised with MAG in the oleogel mixtures and influenced the growth of lipidic crystal network. Faster cooling rates caused smaller crystals whereas thermal history affected the rigidity of oleogel samples. The oleogel samples were whipped and characterised for whipping time, foam overrun, microstructure, rheology and half-life of foam. The whipped oleogels were structured by layer(s) of lipidic crystals surrounding the air bubbles, which had non-spherical shapes and rough textures. The whipping time was remarkably reduced by 80% in the oleogel samples containing smaller lipidic crystals. All whippable oleogel samples had similar foam overrun values and extremely stable against foam collapse. The obtained oil foams exhibited liquid-like behaviour at low frequency as measured by the frequency sweep test.

AB This work highlights the importance of considering reactivity into the quality-driven design of heat-treated foods, which should cover the mitigation of process-induced contaminants and the improvement of the sensory properties of the foodstuff. The joint effects of formulation and baking conditions on reactivity and several quality aspects (i.e. volatile generation, physical properties, sensory and consumer tests), followed by product optimization (i.e. consumer liking and furan mitigation) were studied. While key markers are affected by all factors and their interactions, the effect of sugar and whole egg are the clearest. Furan would be predominantly generated from glucose via caramelization and/or Maillard reaction, whereas the formation of Strecker aldehydes and lipid oxidation products would be favoured by precursors in whole egg. Formulations with a low glucose content, baked at low temperatures/short times lead to optimal products. Egg-based ingredient content may be set according to preference or by applying different optimization approaches.

ID HIGH HYDROSTATIC-PRESSURE; CALCIUM; STABILITY
AB We examine the morphology of hydrogels made of bovine serum albumin and gelatin following high pressure processing at 300 MPa for 15 min at 10 and 80 degrees C. Emphasis is on the distribution of added calcium counterions between the polymeric phases seen in changes in the structural properties of the composite gel. Protocol includes thermal and HPP treatments, dynamic oscillation rheology, ESEM, and modeling from the "synthetic polymer approach" to rationalize results. Pressurization at 10 degrees C produced continuous gelatin networks with dispersed BSA inclusions whereas pressurization at 80 degrees C yielded an inverse dispersion of BSA as the continuous phase supporting liquid gelatin inclusions. Lewis and Nielsen equations were adapted to predict the counterion distribution between the polymeric phases that profoundly affected the structural properties of the pressurized gels. The concept of counterion partition (pc) is introduced to the literature to follow the phase behavior of the composites in the presence of added calcium counterions.

AB Probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are generally employed in food industry because they contribute to nutritional value of fermented foods. Although knowledge of LAB composition is of high relevance for various industrial and biotechnological applications, the comprehensive identification of LAB species is sometimes technically challenging. Recently, MALDI-TOF MS-based methodologies for bacteria detection/identification in clinical diagnostics and agri-food proved to be an attractive strategy, complementary to traditional techniques for their sensitivity and specificity.
   In this study, we propose, for the first time, a novel methodology based on high resolution nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS for LAB identification at genus, species and sub-species level by using the sequence regions 33-52 and 72-82 of the S16 ribosomal protein as proteotypic peptide markers.
   The developed methodology was then applied to the analyses of buffalo and bovine whey starter cultures, thus assessing the applicability of the approach for the detection of LAB also in complex matrices.

AB Mango byproducts, such as peels, contain high levels of antioxidants and fiber and represent important sources of nutraceuticals and pharmacological products. Fruit are collected at the mature green stage then stored and ripened, undergoing several structural and molecular changes over the course of this process. However, very little is known regarding the content and nature of antioxidant compounds in peels of elite and local cultivars during postharvest shelf life (PSL). We screened the phenolic compound content of six cultivars during PSL, including elite (Kent, Tommy, and Ataulfo) and local (Manila, Manililla, and Criollo) mangoes, using a targeted metabolomics approach. We determined that Ataulfo mangoes exhibited the highest content of phenolic compounds during PSL. Untargeted metabolomics and comparative proteomics in Ataulfo and Manililla showed these cultivars to be significant sources of phenolic and lipidic compounds, with the latter cultivar also representing an interesting candidate as a new source for nutraceutical products.

AB The present work investigated the impact of incubation time (0, 1, 3, and 5 day) on the properties and functionalities of conjugates formed between pea protein isolate (PPI) and gum Arabic (GA). The participation of both 11S and 7S to form conjugates with GA was proved by SDS-PAGE. The degree of conjugation reaction of conjugated was characterized by measuring the formation of Maillard reaction products, the loss of free amino groups, and color changes. The results suggested that PPI intimately incorporated into GA after 1 day incubation, giving a non-homogeneous microstructure with a reduction of nearly 18% available free amino and an increase of relative solubility to 15.5%. Additionally, emulsions prepared by PPI-GA conjugates showed smaller particle size, higher surface charge, and stronger steric hindrance to stabilize the emulsion droplets against environmental stresses and lipid oxidation. The findings provide a practical means to improve the functionality of pea proteins.

AB The quality of meat products is influenced by protein oxidation. Understanding the effects of antioxidant polyphenols and oxidizing lipoperoxides on myofibrillar proteins is essential for controlling the quality of meat products. This study was designed to investigate the epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)-mediated formation of myofibrillar protein emulsion gels under malondialdehyde (MDA)-induced oxidative stress. Low MDA concentrations (3 and 6 mM) improved the water-holding capacity, strength, elasticity, and emulsifying properties of gels due to the enhanced protein-protein interactions via MDA. The addition of EGCG reduced the overall properties of the emulsion gel due to further modification of the proteins. At a high concentration of MDA (12 mM), there was excessive cross-linking and unfolding of myofibrillar proteins, which led to a compact gel structure, and reduced the overall properties of the gel. In this situation, the addition of EGCG protected myofibrillar proteins from modifications induced by MDA and improved the quality of emulsion gels.

AB To explore the role of phenolic compounds in oral aroma release during wine tasting, four rose wines supplemented with three types of commercial phenolic extracts and a control wine were evaluated. Wines were aromatized with a mixture of six target aroma compounds. -In vivo oral aroma release was monitored in six volunteers at two different times after wine rinsing, just after spitting of the wine (immediate release), and four minutes later (prolonged release). To check the sensory meaning of these changes, descriptive analysis using a trained panel (n=10) was also performed. Results showed a strong individual effect on total oral aroma release at the two sampling points. After the oral exposure to wines with phenolic extracts, a lower release of most target aroma compounds was also determined. Lower intensity scores for some aroma attributes in wines with phenolic extracts were found, showing a good agreement between the two scientific approaches.

AB Debittered bitter gourd juice was subjected to gamma irradiation doses of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5 and 2.5 kGy and thermal pasteurization at temperatures of 65, 75, 85 and 95 degrees C. Shigella boydii was the most heat resistant pathogen tested (D-10 of 42.8 s at 65 degrees C) while Bacillus cereus was the most resistant pathogen to irradiation with a D-10 of 0.46 kGy. No significant (p < 0.05) effect of thermal pasteurization was observed on antidiabetic (alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibition) activity, however, a 10% increase in alpha-glucosidase inhibition was observed in irradiated (2.5 kGy) samples. A significant (p < 0.05) but marginal reduction (up to 10%) was observed in antidiabetic activity during storage for a period of 90 days. Thermal pasteurization at 65 degrees C demonstrated significantly (p < 0.05) higher sensory quality as compared to irradiated (2.5 kGy) samples. This is first report on effect of pasteurization on antidiabetic activity of bitter gourd juice.

AB Colour is an important quality attribute for the consumer's acceptability of fruit. Elevated CO2 was applied to strawberry fruit to explore its influence on chlorophyll catabolism and anthocyanin synthesis. The results showed that 20% CO2 delayed the changes of a* and b* values in strawberry fruit. The degradation of chlorophyll was delayed in CO2 treated fruit by inhibiting the activities of chlorophyllase and down-regulating the expression of FaChl b reductase, FaPAO and FaRCCR. In addition, lower concentration of anthocyanins and lower activity of PAL, C4H, 4CL and CHS were recorded under the effect of 20% CO2. Meanwhile, qRT-PCR analysis showed that 13 genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway and the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway were also down-regulated under CO2 stress. However, no residual effect on pigment metabolism was observed when elevated CO2 was removed. Our study provided new insights into the regulation of elevated CO2 in the role of pigment metabolism in postharvest.

AB The effect of moderate Fe overload in the diet and its interaction with phytate, and/or yacon flour (YF), recognized as an inhibitor, and facilitator, of Fe absorption, respectively, was evaluated in healthy rats. For this purpose the following parameters were analyzed: (1) apparent iron (Fe), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) absorption; (2) blood Fe; (3) blood lipids (cholesterol, tryacylglicerol); (4) blood AST and ALT; (5) liver histology (histopathology, hemosiderin depots, apoptosis index; (6) liver fatty acid incorporation; (7) liver antioxidant enzyme activity. Moderate Fe overload may cause change in some liver markers (hemosiderin depots, apoptosis index and GPx) and blood lipids (total cholesterol and VLDL) and the interaction with yacon flour, and phytate, in the Fe overloaded diets may exert a protective effect on these alterations.

AB Hesperidin, the major flavonoid in citrus species, possesses various biological functions and pharmacological activities, however, its insolubility in water limits its bioavailability and medical or food application. When 8 g/L octenyl succinic anhydride modified sweet potato starch (OSA-SPS) with degree of substitution 0.0051 was applied to solubilize hesperidin under the conditions of stirring the mixture for 6 h at 2400 r/min, 50 degrees C and unadjusted pH, the solubilization efficiency of hesperidin was 6.52 folds higher than that without OSAS addition. It was noteworthy that the solubilization of hesperidin was obviously different from that of hesperetin (hydrolysate of hesperidin) either in starch origin of OSAS or in the influence of external factors. The interaction between OSA-SPS and hesperidin had been certified by means of FT-IR, XRD, DSC, H-1/2D NMR. These results would give a fundamental reference for probing specific mechanism between hesperidin and OSAS in the further research.

AB In this study, the effect of the extraction method (mechanical pressing, MP and organic solvent, OS) and the specie (Cucurbita argyrosperma Huber, CA; and Cucurbita moschata Duchesne, CM) on the content of bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity of oil from pumpkin of Yucatan, Mexico was investigated. Between the two extraction methods, the oil extracted by MP obtained the highest values for total phenolic compounds (TPC), total carotenoids, squalene, quercetin, beta-carotene, fucosterol, stigmasterol and antioxidant activity (DPPH, ABTS and reducing power). Between the two species, the CM oil extracted with MP or OS exhibited the highest values for carotenoids, sterols and antioxidant activity (DPPH and ABTS). Thus, it can be concluded that the method and specie affect the composition of bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity of the pumpkin oil. This information is useful for the extraction of pumpkin oil with a higher content of compounds, of interest for the industry.

AB Microwave pretreatment of rapeseeds prior to cold-pressing is a simple and desirable method for producing high quality oils. In this study, a rapid and sensitive lipid profiling platform employing an accurate quantification strategy was established based on direct infusion electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Using this developed platform, we further investigated the effect of microwave pretreatment of rapeseeds on the contents of important lipids such as triglycerides (TAGs), phospholipids (PLs), and free fatty acids (FFAs) in 15 different rapeseed oils. Our results demonstrated that no significant changes of total FAs and TAGs contents were observed after microwave pretreatment, while FFA contents increased and PLs contents significantly increased up to 40 folds. The potential mechanism of lipid changes was also discussed. The established lipidomics profiling platform can provide reliable lipids profiling data and help to better understand the potential mechanism of microwave pretreatment in oil processing.

AB Prebiotic fructooligosaccharides (FOS) are currently obtained by enzymatic reaction with fructosyltransferases (FTFs) using sucrose as both donor and acceptor. In these reactions glucose results as the most abundant by-product, arising from each fructosyl transfer event and, together with fructose, because of the inherent hydrolytic activity of the FTFs. As FOS are mainly used as prebiotic in nutraceutical foods, the reduction or total elimination of monosaccharides is required. In this work the selective elimination of monosaccharides from a synthetic FOS mixture was achieved through the selective complexation of glucose and fructose with phenyl boronic acid (PBAc) followed by ethyl-acetate extraction. The process was applied to a complex mixture of FOS obtained in an enzymatic synthesis reaction containing 40% glucose, 15.8% fructose and 35% of FOS, elimination of the sugars was achieved through 3:1 molar reactions, resulting in a levan-type FOS product with 97% purity.

AB Catalytically active nanomaterials have several advantages over their natural analogues when used as artificial enzymes (nanozymes), namely, higher stability and lower cost. Nanozymes with metallic nanocomposites are promising catalysts for biosensing applications. The aim of the current research is to construct oxidase-based bioelectrodes for food analysis using nanozymes as peroxidase mimetics. Bimetallic PtRu nanoparticles (nPtRu) coupled with alcohol oxidase (AO) and methylamine oxidase (AMO) were chosen to construct amperometric biosensors (ABSs) for primary alcohols and methylamine (MA). Both ABSs show high sensitivities (336 A.M-1.m(-2) for the AO-ABS and 284 A.M-1.m(-2) for the AMO-ABS), broad linear ranges (25-200 mu M ethanol and 20-600 mu M MA) and satisfactory storage stabilities. Practical feasibility of the constructed ABSs was demonstrated on food samples. High correlation between contents of MA and ethanol in foods determined by the ABSs and reference methods was observed.

AB The effect of dextran produced in situ by Weissella confusa on the structure and nutrition quality of whole grain pearl millet bread containing 50% of wheat flour was investigated. NMR spectroscopy analysis indicated that the dextran formed by the strain consisted of a alpha-(1 -> 6)-linked linear backbone and 3% alpha-(1 -> 3) branches, and had a molar mass of 3.3 x 10(6) g/mol. In situ production resulted in 3.5% dextran (DW) which significantly enhanced the dough extensional properties, increased the bread specific volume (similar to 13%) and decreased crumb firmness (similar to 43%), moisture loss (similar to 15%) and staling rate (similar to 10%), compared to the control millet bread. DSC analysis showed that amylopectin recrystallization was significantly reduced in the bread containing dextran. In situ dextran production altered the nutritional value of millet, leading to increased free phenolic content (similar to 30%) and antioxidant activity. It also markedly lowered the bread predicted glycemic index and improved in vitro protein digestibility.

AB The effect of hop sourdough fermentation combined with rice bran (RB) addition was investigated for improving technological, bioactive and sensory properties of wheat bread by optimizing the quantities of RB, yeast, sourdough and hop extract contents based on response surface methodology. The bread produced according to the optimized formula was compared with control bread, sourdough or RB-enhanced bread with regard to quality attributes, bioaccessible phenolics and antioxidant activity. Sourdough fermentation combined with RB flour increased volume of loaves and consumer acceptance with no significant variations in crumb moisture content and crumb firmness during storage. RB darkened crumb while no effects on colour were observed for sourdough bread. Sourdough technology allowed increasing phenolic content of RB bread with no significant differences in its antioxidant activity. The bioaccessible ferulic and sinapic acids, the main phenolics released in vitro digestion of optimized bread were lower compared to those of control bread.

AB The effect of infrared roasting (130, 150 and 170 degrees C for 10 min) on antioxidant activity, total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), Maillard reaction products (MRP) and phenolic profile in eight Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) varieties were investigated. TFC (23.74-28.67 mg RE/g) remained unchanged at 130 degrees C and 150 degrees C but exhibited a sharp decline at 170 degrees C. TPC (8.90-14.72 mg GAE/g) and TAA (11.37-12.74 mu mol TE/g) decreased significantly with increase in roasting temperature. The lowest fluorescence of advanced MRP (FAST) index was observed for buckwheat roasted at 130 degrees C (230.76-338.55%) and the highest at 170 degrees C (420.30-523.72%). IC-341651 and IC-107994 had high antioxidant properties and SMLBW-4 exhibited lowest browning index (BI), free fluorescent intermediate compounds (FIC) and FAST index, indicating the least MRP formation. Gallic acid and quercetin were detected in only bound and free-form, respectively. Rutin was the most thermostable polyphenol detected in all buckwheat varieties.

AB Roasting of green tea causes oligomerization of tea catechins, which decreases the astringency. The aim of this study was to elucidate the oligomerization mechanism. The C-13 NMR spectrum of the oligomer fraction showed signals arising from catechin and sugar residues. Heating of epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate with C-13-labeled glucose (150 degrees C for 2 h) suggested that condensation of sugars with catechin A-rings caused the oligomerization. The dimeric product obtained by heating for a shorter period (30 min) suggested cross-linking occurred between sugars and catechin A-rings. Furthermore, heating of phloroglucinol, a catechin A-ring mimic, with glucose, methylglyoxal, and dihydroxyacetone, confirmed that the basic mechanism included reaction of the catechin A-ring methine carbons with carbonyl carbons of glucose and their pyrolysis products.

AB Lactobacillus pentosus (LP) are widely used as probiotics in food products, dietary supplements, and nutraceuticals due to their health-promoting effects. To confer a functional effect, the probiotics need to survive during shelf-life and transit through the high acidic conditions of the stomach and bile salts in the small intestine. Herein, LP was firstly encapsulated in a layer-by-layer approach using chitosan (CS) and sodium phytate (SP). After digestion in simulated gastrointestinal fluid (SGF) for 120 min and 4% bile salts for 3 h, plain-LP exhibited a 7.40 and 6.09 colony forming units/ml (cfu/ml) reduction. Interestingly, two layer coated LP ((CS/SP)(2)-LP) exhibited less death, which reduced 4.34 and 2.33 log cfu/ml, respectively. Specially, (CS/SP)(2)-LP also showed a higher survival rate compared to plain-LP in heat treatment experiments, especially 65 degrees C. In conclusion, layer-by-layer encapsulation of LP has great potential for the protection and delivery of probiotics in food and nutraceutical products.

AB The present study demonstrated the hydrolysis of peony seed protein isolate (PSPI) by using alcalase and resulted in the generation of an anti-oxidative peptide. In brief, a model was used to illustrate the enzymolysis of PSPI with the determination of kinetic factors as per investigation information. The model proved suitable to explain the PSPI hydrolysis by alcalase. A novel anti-oxidative peptide was obtained successfully by ultrafiltration and a series of chromatography techniques. Subsequently, a purified fragment was identified with the amino acid sequence of SMRKPPG followed by its synthesis and evaluation of its anti-oxidative activities. After hydrolysis, the peony seed protein hydrolysate (PSPH) with the degree of hydrolysis of 18% displayed the most significant antioxidant action which was further used to isolate the anti-oxidative peptide.

AB The exposure of fatty products to environmental light can trigger lipid oxidation in food through a sensitized-photooxidation process, which involves the participation of the species singlet oxygen (O-2((1)Delta(g))). Therefore, preservation of food quality represents a subject of great economic interest to the food industry. In this sense, the phenolic compounds are natural antioxidants widely used in food industry.
   In this contribution we studied the interactions of phenolic derivatives (Phd), tyrosol and tyrosol derived isomers, with O-2((1)Delta(g)) and their possible protective effect against the oxidative degradation of unsaturated fatty acids and amino acids. Besides, a potential synergistic interaction between Phd and antioxidants used in food industry were investigated.
   Phd substrates showed properties as antioxidant additives due to their high ability deactivating O-2((1)Delta(g)) through a physical process and synergistic effect in the presence of commercial antioxidants. Phd presented an antioxidant protective effect toward O-2((1)Delta(g))-mediated degradation of methyl linoleate and tryptophan.

AB Carotenoids are lipophilic compounds that are digested and absorbed along with lipids. Emulsions based on a mixture of plum tomato and red sweet pepper, with 5% or 10% rapeseed oil, were obtained by high pressure homogenization, and the concentration of carotenoids in the emulsion oil droplets was quantified. The fraction of lycopene and beta-carotene released from the plant matrix into the oil droplets was highest in the 10% emulsion, which had larger oil droplets than the 5% emulsion. Xanthophylls were easily released into oil droplets in both 5% and 10% emulsions. The results suggest that the release of carotenoids made available for intestinal absorption depends on carotenoid type and can be significantly improved by increasing the homogenization pressure and oil content. However, in vitro gastrointestinal digestion indicated the presence of constituents or structures in the emulsions, originating from tomato, that reduced pancreatic activity, which may delay micellarization and uptake of carotenoids.

AB Germination in the presence of selenium (Se) is an alternative to increase the healthy properties of seeds. This study aimed to compare the Se accumulation in different protein fractions from germinated chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) and the effect on digestibility and cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) of protein hydrolysates. Chickpeas were germinated during four days after soaking with sodium selenite (0, 1, or 2 mg/100 g seeds). Total protein (TP) and glutelin (Glu), albumin (Alb) and globulin (Glo) fractions were digested and ultrafiltrated through a 10 kDa membrane. Se accumulated in the order of Glu > Alb > Glo. Ultrafiltrated Glu hydrolysate of four days germinated chickpeas treated with 2 mg Na2SeO3/100 g increased CAA (51.47%), demonstrating the potential health benefits of selenization. The intensity of vicilin bands (34-37 kDa) increased from the second to the fourth day compared with the control samples. Glo digestibility was higher in selenized chickpea sprouts.

AB Dried egg white powders are used in many segments of the food industry in place of traditional liquid egg materials. Dry heating during the processing of these products plays an essential role in obtaining their excellent functionalities, which are associated with protein aggregation. The objective of this study was to understand the aggregation behaviour of ovalbumin (OVA), the major component of egg-white proteins, during dry heating at 75 degrees C for 21 days. The results indicated that OVA aggregation increased from 28.7 +/- 1.23% to 57.5 +/- 2.45% as the reaction time increased, resulting in the generation of insoluble aggregates that were often 1-100 nm in diameter. However, a few soluble OVA aggregates became insoluble precipitates as their morphology changed from long strands to denser networks after 15 days of heat treatment. Moreover, covalent bonds, hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic repulsion played important roles in the formation of the small aggregates.

AB To test the effects of bentonite addition at various stages of fermentation, five Malvazija istarska white grape must vinification treatments were performed with 100 g/hL of bentonite added in clear juice, at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of fermentation, while control was fermented without bentonite. Phenols and free and bound volatile aromas were determined by HPLC-DAD and SPE-GC-MS. Wines were evaluated sensorially. Fining during fermentation reduced the total bentonite dose required, and was most effective near the end of fermentation with the reduction of 16% and 21%, depending on the protein stability test. All treated wines preserved more hydroxycinnamoyltartaric acids with respect to control. The side-effect of these treatments on varietal aromas was moderate, but enhanced the preservation of key fermentation volatiles in relation to control, and exhibited positive sensory effects. It was concluded that bentonite added during fermentation may positively affect wine quantity and quality.

AB Mozzarella di Bufala Campana (MBC) is a PDO cheese produced from whole buffalo milk in specific regions of southern Italy. Due to the high price and the limited amount of buffalo milk, MBC is potentially subject to mislabelling. Stable isotope ratio analysis combined with elemental analysis is one powerful technique for detecting the authenticity of PDO cheeses. Here, the elemental and isotopic profiles of authentic samples of buffalo milk and the corresponding MBC samples collected in the reference area in winter and summer are presented in an initial exploratory study. By merging MBC-PDO samples with non-PDO samples of buffalo mozzarella produced both inside and outside the reference area, a model was developed to classify product categories for this cheese. Despite the differences occurring during processing, along with differences in the season and production area, the model was effective in distinguishing PDO and non-PDO mozzarella, particularly when non-PDO cheeses were made outside the MBC reference area.

AB Reducing starch digestibility can significantly benefit efforts to combat obesity and associated chronic diseases. Polymeric proanthocyanidins (PA) form complexes with starch via unknown mechanisms, resulting in dramatically decreased starch digestibility. We hypothesized that V-type complexes are involved in these interactions. Sorghum derived PA was complexed with amylose, amylopectin, and granular maize starches in regular and deuterated solvents, and structural properties and in vitro digestibility of the complexes investigated. Based on iodine binding, X-ray diffraction patterns, crystallinity, and thermal properties, we demonstrated, for the first time, that type II semi-crystalline V-complexes are formed between amylose and PA. Furthermore, suppression of H-bonding led to amorphous complexes, suggesting extensive H-bonding facilitate and/or stabilize the V-complexes. We speculate that the complexation involves inclusion of B-rings of the PA units into the amylose helical cavity. The V-complex formation significantly increased resistant starch in gelatinized normal starch and pure amylose (by 35-45%), indicating likely physiological benefits.

Water was selected because good recoveries (97-109%) were obtained for both analytes. Low consumption of reagents and small quantities of waste are two important advantages of the proposed method. Accuracy was evaluated by analysis of a standard reference material, which agreed with certified values (91-101%). The results for repeatability (RSDs <= 4%) and intermediate precision (RSDs <= 7%) prove the good precision of the proposed method. Limits of quantification were 16 and 17 mg kg(-1) for Cl and S, respectively. Concentrations of Cl and S varied across a wide range (Cl: 35-930 mg kg(-1); S: 678-5124 mg kg(-1)) for 34 samples analyzed, which were, for most of the results, close to the values found in the literature.

AB In this work, we propose a method that employed a smartphone to capture images obtained from a colorimetric spot test to determine ascorbic acid (AA) in Brazilian Amazon native and exotic fruits. The spot test reaction was based on reduction of Fe(III) by AA and further complexation with 1,10-phenanthroline. After optimization, the limit of detection was 8.5 x 10(-7) mol L-1. Brazilian Amazon native fruits such as bacuri, cupuacu, muruci, yellow mombin, as well as others as cashew, mango, orange and passion fruit, were analyzed. In order to determine the accuracy of this method, iodometric titration was used; results were in close agreement with a confidence level of 95% (paired t-test). Moreover, recoveries ranged from 87.1 to 116%. The method is economic, environmentally friendly, and portable, and might useful for small producers and family agriculture businesses unable to afford specialized laboratory analysis in the north region of Brazilian Amazon.

AB Tea aroma is determined by the nature of the plant, the production processes, and many other factors influencing its formation and release. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of manufacturing processes on the aroma composition of tea. Fresh tea leaves from the same cultivar and growing area were selected for producing the six types of tea: green, white, yellow, oolong, black, and dark teas. Comprehensive analysis by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was performed for the volatiles of tea infusion, prepared by solid-phase microextraction (SPME), solid-phase extraction (SPE), and solvent assisted flavor evaporation (SAFE). A total of 168 volatile compounds were identified. Black tea has the highest volatile concentration of 710 mu g/g, while green tea has the lowest concentration of 20 mu g/g. Significantly affected by these processes, tea aroma molecules are formed mainly from four precursor groups: carotenoids, fatty acids, glycosides, and amino acids/sugars.

AB This study investigated the effect of ultrasound on chitinase activity and conformational changes. Results revealed that ultrasound activated chitinase with a maximum enhancement of 19.17% compared with the untreated chitinase. Furthermore, an increase of V-max and a decrease of K-m after sonication were obtained, illustrating that the affinity between chitinase and substrate was intensified. No obvious effect on the tolerance to most metal ions was exhibited whether sonicated or not (p > 0.05). The conformational changes of chitinase were analyzed by circular dichroism (CD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy. Results indicated that the activation of chitinase induced by ultrasound was presumably due to the decrease of tryptophan on the chitinase surface and the increase of beta-sheet and random coil in chitinase secondary conformation. In brief, ultrasound is a possible way to activate chitinase to increase its application in food industry.

AB Food processing techniques are inevitable technological measures that aim to increase and sustain the quality of agricultural products. This is traditionally achieved by the application of heat or exposure to chemicals. Since the advent of X-rays, food scientists have been evaluating the prospect of employing ionising radiations for pest removal, sprouting inhibition and shelf-life extension of food products. Gamma radiation, electron beam and X-rays have emerged as the favoured methods of food irradiation in recent years. Several decades of research have endeavoured to determine the advantage and disadvantage of subjecting food materials to radiation. This has resulted in several international bodies, such as WHO and FAO, certifying that food irradiation is a safe processing method. This review article provides an insight of the various effects of irradiation on food with respect to nutritional quality, shelf-life extension, toxicological aspects, legislation pertaining to food irradiation and global acceptability.

AB The objective of this work was to deepen on the study of functional properties of the phytochemicals present in Prosopis alba exudate gum (G), as well as to rule out possible adverse effects of some of its components. Commonly employed purification methods were compared. Filtration prevents further loss of potentially bioactive compounds. The filtrated gum showed a higher concentration of phenolics, flavonoids and tannins than arabic gum, which was correlated with better in vitro antioxidant properties. Particularly, tannins, commonly considered as toxic compounds in exudate gums, were found in lower concentration than in others gums obtained from genus Prosopis and Acacia. The toxicological evaluation performed on rats did not show symptoms of intoxication associated with the administration of the gum. These results provide useful evidence to support the potential use of G as a safe functional food additive with the added benefit of taking advantage of a nonexploited natural resource.

AB This study investigated effects of the simultaneous application of thymol and salicylic acid (SIMTSA) on the target sites of Rhizopus stolonifer, as well as the defence enzymes of postharvest tomato, when applied as edible coating. SIMTSA induced the changes of ultrastructure and membrane integrity of R. stolonifer. When the concentrations of the fungistat increased, cells stained with propidium iodide and leakage of 260/280 nm-absorbing materials increased while ergosterol synthesis decreased, suggesting damage of cell membrane. Furthermore, SIMTSA treatment significantly reduced the citric acid content and the activities of enzymes related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and increased the mitochondrial membrane potential and the reactive oxygen species, indicating damage of mitochondrial-related functions. Moreover, SIMTSA edible coating increased the defence enzyme activities in tomato. Based on the results, SIMTSA can be used as a potential preservation method for tomato as it showed a targeted effect on the cell membrane and mitochondria of R. stolonifer.

AB This study aimed to reveal the physiological mechanism of resistance to postharvest blue mold of kiwifruit. Hongyang and Qihong kiwifruits were inoculated with Penicillium expansum (P. expansum) and stored at low temperature (0 +/- 1 degrees C). The disease incidence and lesion diameter, activities of defense-related enzymes, and contents of defense-related substance of Hongyang and Qihong kiwifruits were also compared, combined with the observation of fruit pericarp structure by scanning electron microscopy. Results showed that the disease resistance of Hongyang was stronger than that of Qihong with late onset, low incidence, and small lesion diameter. And Hongyang kiwifruit showed a high biochemical resistance after inoculation with P. expansum. The epidermis structure of Hongyang kiwifruit had typical disease resistance characteristics with a dense epidermis structure, orderly cell arrangement, and less obvious microcracks. The strong biochemical resistance, dense, and complete epidermis structure of Hongyang fundamentally guarantee its strong resistance to diseases.

AB The nanoencapsulation of carotenoids is presented as a positive alternative to broaden the application of these pigments in the food industry. In this study, we investigated the use of yellow passion fruit albedo flour as an encapsulating material for the production of nanodispersions of carotenoid extract obtained from Spirulina sp. LEB 18. Nanodispersions were characterized for their physicochemical properties, antioxidant activity, stability, and retention of carotenoids after 60 days of storage (4 degrees C). The nanodispersions made from yellow passion fruit albedo flour and microalgae carotenoid extract presented an average particle diameter at the nanometer scale, high antioxidant activity, and carotenoid retention compared to nanodispersions containing synthetic beta-carotene. Yellow passion fruit albedo flour as a polymeric material in the production of carotenoid nanodispersions is an alternative to commercial polymers and allows greater stability and broader application of these pigments.

AB We investigated the relationship between the pre-drying temperature and overall quality of dried shiitake mushrooms (Lentinula edodes). Results showed that high-temperature pre-drying significantly increased the rehydration ratio and hardness of dried shiitake mushrooms, but decreased the degree of shrinkage, degree of browning, and formaldehyde content. The levels of enzyme activity were high throughout the pre-drying process and benefitted the formation of flavoured substances. Furthermore, high-temperatures pre-drying also resulted in a higher content of sulfur compounds. These results indicated that the pre-drying processing had significant impacts on the overall quality of dried shiitake mushrooms. This may pave the way for increasing the economic value of dried shiitake mushrooms.

AB Buckwheat constitutes a good source of bioactive components. A dry fractionation of surface abrasion for polyphenol-enriched protein combined with hydrothermal treatment was evaluated as an alternative to conventional wet extraction from tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench). The protein contents and the total polyphenol contents of both free and bound polyphenol gradually decreased in the order from the outer to the inner fractions. Polyphenol-enriched buckwheat protein flour was successfully enrichment with a maximum polyphenol content of 55 mg/g. Moreover, starch digestibility and polyphenols bioaccessibility of the buckwheat protein were increased with hydrothermal treatment time, while protein digestibility decreased slightly. Besides, most of the aroma compounds increased during the hydrothermal treatment. The assessment results demonstrate that the sustainability dry surface abrasion process in combination with hydrothermal treatment should be encouraged in processing functional protein fractions and improving both qualities of end use products and health benefits.

AB The study was designed to evaluate how the distillation process is able to affect the composition and bioactivity of oligosaccharides contained in the grape seeds. Different oligosaccharidic fractions have been extracted both before and after grape pomace distillation in order to valorize this by-product. A multistep solid-phase extraction approach (C-18 and carbograph cartridges) has been applied to purify and fractionate the oligosaccharidic compounds. Chemical characterization of the fractions was performed using a UPLC-ESI-MSn method. Complex oligosaccharides consist principally of neutral oligosaccharides rich in arabinose and glucose. Then, the oligosaccharides contained in the different fractions as potential functional ingredients with prebiotic activity toward well-known probiotic bacteria, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus plantarum, were evaluated. Data showed how, in some combination, oligosaccharidic fractions obtained may be considered a novel "functional ingredient" with potential prebiotic activity mainly towards L. acidophilus.

AB Stilbenoids represent a large group of bioactive compounds, which occur in food and medicinal plants.
   Twenty-five stilbenoids were screened in vitro for their ability to inhibit COX-1, COX-2 and 5-LOX. Piceatannol and pinostilbene showed activity comparable to the zileuton and ibuprofen, respectively.
   The anti-inflammatory potential of stilbenoids was further evaluated using THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cell line. Tests of the cytotoxicity on the THP-1 and HCT116 cell lines showed very low toxic effects. The tested stilbenoids were evaluated for their ability to attenuate the LPS-stimulated activation of NF-kappa B/AP-1. Most of the tested substances reduced the activity of NF-kappa B/AP-1 and later attenuated the expression of TNF-alpha.
   The effects of selected stilbenoids were further investigated on inflammatory signaling pathways. Non-prenylated stilbenoids regulated attenuation of NF-kappa B/AP-1 activity upstream by inhibiting the phosphorylation of MAPKs.
   A docking study used to in silico analyze the tested compounds confirmed their interaction with NF-kappa B, COX-2 and 5-LOX.

AB Malolactic fermentation (MLF), usually induced by Oenococcus oeni (O. oeni), is an important process to improve wine quality. Acid acclimation has been proven to be useful for enhancing the viability of lyophilized O. oeni. To explain the involved mechanisms, cell integrity, morphology and protein patterns of lyophilized O. oeni SD-2a were investigated with acid acclimation. After lyophilization, improvement of cell integrity and more extra-cellular polymeric substances (EPS) were observed in acid acclimated cells. Combined with GO and KEGG analysis, different abundant proteins were noticeably enriched in the carbohydrate metabolism process, especially amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism. The most significant result was the over-expression of proteins participating in cell wall biosynthesis, EPS production, ATP binding and the bacterial secretion system. This result indicated the important role of acid acclimation on cell envelope properties. In addition, protein response to stress and arginine deiminase pathway were also proven to be over-expressed.

AB We synthesized polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers and citrate-capped gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and explored the applicability of the PAMAM/AuNP assay in determining total free fatty acid (FFA) contents in edible oils based on a competitive colorimetry, in which the PAMAM-triggered AuNP aggregation was suppressed by FFAs. The generation and concentration of PAMAMs, the chain lengths of FFAs as well as the concentration and pH of the background electrolytes of the assay were optimized. The average acid values of the sunflower seed, corn and extra virgin olive oils determined by PAMAM/AuNP assay were 1.31 +/- 0.07, 0.33 +/- 0.02 and 1.49 +/- 0.07, respectively, which were not significantly different from the corresponding 1.27 +/- 0.08, 0.32 +/- 0.01 and 1.61 +/- 0.06 by the standard nonaqueous titration. Our results suggest that the method is promising in detecting FFAs in edible oils, and implementation of the method expands the technological scope for FFA analysis.

AB Legumes represent staple foods rich in phenolic compounds, which are often consumed after soaking and boiling. This study determines the fate of phenolic compounds from six legumes varieties belonging to the species Lens culinaris Medik., Phaseolus vulgaris L. and Cicer arietinum L. after soaking, boiling and digestion. To this purpose, a new HPLC-DAD method was developed and validated. Results show that the cooking process strongly reduces the content in free and bound phenolic compounds and that the processing water is a valuable source of phenolics. Bioaccessibility of phenolics from the legume matrix was investigated separately in the coat and the cotyledons of three chosen varieties (black beans, black lentils and pinto beans) by means of a standardized in vitro digestion protocol. Results showed that only a fraction of the phenolic compounds is bioaccessible, which may have implications for human health.

AB Winter and summer nitrate/nitrite concentrations in 11 salad vegetables were surveyed using a validated HPLC-DAD method. Nitrate was highest in rocket, both in winter ((x) over bar = 3974 mg kg(-1) fw) and summer ((x) over bar = 3819 mg kg(-1) fw). High nitrate accumulators included spinach, purslane, chards, dill, coriander and parsley. Wide intra-species variability and levels in excess of permitted maxima highlighted the importance of monitoring vegetable production methods to protect consumer health. Occurrence of detectible nitrite (14-352 mg kg(-1) fw) was most frequent in winter head cabbage. Three additional experiments examined the seasonal effects of nitrogen (N) fertilization rate, application method, formulation and postharvest storage on nitrate and nitrite levels in lettuce, rocket and spinach. Violation of current nitrate limits is likely when total N exceeds 200 kg ha(-1), particularly in rocket and spinach. Postharvest nitrate reduction requires exogenous microbial nitrate reductase activity, which is unlikely to be achieved without visible loss of quality.

AB Legume seeds and sprouts are a rich source of phytoestrogens in the form of isoflavonoids. For the first time, lactic acid fermentation of four types of legume sprouts was used to increase the content of isoflavonoids and microbiological safety. After germination, the highest content of isoflavonoids was observed in the clover and chickpea sprouts, which amounted to 1.1 g/100 g dw., whereas the lactic acid fermentation allowed the increase to as much as 5.5 g/100 g dw. The most beneficial properties were shown by fermented chickpea sprouts germinated in blue light. During fermentation the number of lactic acid bacteria increased by 2 Log(10) CFU/mL (LU), whereas mold decreased by 1 LU, E. coli and Klebsiella sp. by 2 LU, Salmonella sp. and Shigella sp. did not occur after fermentation, similar to Staphylococcus epidermidis, while S. aureus and S. saprophyticus decreased by 3 LU and in some trials were not detected.

AB Whole grain rice, which has the bran layer intact, contains more nutrients and health beneficial compounds than its milled rice equivalent. Its consumption is associated with a reduction in the risk of developing several chronic diseases. However, the bran contains non-starch lipids deposited along with the lipid degrading enzymes, lipase and lipoxygenase, resulting in a relatively short shelf life for whole grain rice. We studied the genotypic diversity of lipase induced hydrolytic rancidity (HR) level in the bran of 134 diverse genotypes and found more than a 15-fold variation. Among the genotypes, those with red or brown bran had lower HR than the purple, light brown and white brans. Total phenolic content and anthocyanins were negatively correlated with the HR in purple brans suggesting their inhibitory effect on lipase during bran storage. In conclusion, low HR genotypes could be used as breeding materials to improve the storage stability of whole grain rice.

TI CDCA8 is a key mediator of estrogen-stimulated cell proliferation in

DT Article
DE CDCA8; Estrogen; Breast cancer; Apoptosis; Proliferation
AB Endocrine therapy is effective in the early stage of breast cancer treatment, and most tumor cells will gain the ability to proliferate under residual amounts of estrogen, which will cause the recurrence of the disease. The role of cell division cycle associated 8 (CDCA8) in Estradiol (E2)-stimulated breast cancer cells growth is investigated in this research. CDCA8 showed higher mRNA expression in E2-stimulated MCF7 and T47D cells, and such an increase could also be observed in tumor samples. CDCA8 shRNA inhibited the survival and growth detected by cell number and colony formation, while promoted cell cycle G1 phase arrest determined with flow cytometry, which coordinated with a decrease in E2-induced molecules, namely Cyclin Dl (CCND1), B-Cell CLL/Lymphoma 2 (BCL2), and an increase in apoptosis-related molecules, such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a (P21) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1b (P27). Kaplan-Meier plot analysis indicated that higher CDCA8 expression was positively associated with poor prognosis with a probability lower than 0.4 at the five-year interval (p = 0.035). All of these suggest that CDCA8 is a key mediator of estrogen-stimulated breast cancer cell growth and survival, which can be utilized as a novel target in breast cancer treatment.

AB A successful embryo implantation depends on the synchronization between a competent blastocyst and a receptive endometrium. Recently, potential modulators of endometrial receptivity (OVGP1, MRAP2, ZCCHC12, and HAP1) have been reported likely with a functional role during embryo implantation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the gene expression of these genes in the endometrium of infertile women.
   Eighteen endometrial biopsies, during secretory lutheal phase, were recruited from women with unexplained infertility and women who cannot conceive due to their partners' fertility problems. qRT-PCR was carried out to evaluate MRAP2, OVGP1, ZCCHC12 and HAP1 gene expression.
   MRAP2 expression was also detected by western blot and it was localized by immunohistochemistry. Morphological analysis was performed by light microscopy. MRAP2 was significantly up-regulated in study vs. control group. Western blot analysis confirmed the observed MRAP2 up-expression. MRAP2 resulted mainly localized in the epithelial cells of uterine glands. Morphological analysis displayed that the epithelium of the uterine glands undergo hypertrophy in women with unexplained infertility in respect to women with male infertility factor.
   MRAP2 could be considered a mediator of endometrial receptivity likely acting on endometrial stability by binding to MCRs and PKR1.

AB Today several millions polymorphic sites in human genome are well described. Many investigators are studying the association between these polymorphisms and susceptibility to multifactorial traits. These polymorphisms are also used for studying the population's genetic structures. Here, we introduce a new simple one step method for estimating the allelic frequency of polymorphic sites in pooled samples. The method is based on measurement of the intensity of polymorphic bands on agarose gel electrophoresis. This method is very simple, rapid, inexpensive, and is more sensitive compared to the chip-based matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry method.

AB Glycogen storage disease type Ib (GSD Ib) is an autosomal recessive disorder, caused by a deficiency of ubiquitously expressed SLC37A4 protein. Deficiency of SLC37A4 leads to abnormal storage of glycogen in the liver and kidneys, resulting in long-term complications of renal disease and hepatocellular adenomas, whose mechanisms are poorly understood. Molecular markers of the adaptive responses to the metabolic stress caused by a deficiency of SLC37A4, such as markers related to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR), have not been extensively studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of molecular markers of the UPR response and apoptosis related to a deficiency of SLC37A4 in kidney cells. For that purpose, we intended to establish a human kidney cell model system for GSD Ib. The novel variant c.248G > A, found in GSD Ib patients, was introduced into the Flp-In (TM) T-REx (TM)-293 cell line using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated precise gene editing method, resulting in significant decrease of SLC37A4 gene expression. In this model system we used RT-qPCR analysis to investigate the expression of molecular markers of the UPR response (ATF4, DDIT3, HSPA5, and XBP1s) and apoptosis (BCL2, BAX). We demonstrated that under chronic metabolic stress conditions caused by SLC37A4 deficiency, the ER stress-induced UPR was triggered, resulting in suppression of the UPR molecular markers and cell survival promotion (decreased expression levels of ATF4, DDIT3, HSPA5, with the exception of XHE1s). However, persistent metabolic stress overrides an adaptation and induces apoptosis through increased expression of pro-apoptotic markers (decreased ratio of BCL2/BAX genes). We established a cellular model system characterized by a deficiency of SLC37A4, which presents pathological manifestations of GSD Ib in the kidney. Expression analysis in a novel model system supports the hypothesis that renal dysfunction in the GSD Ib is partly due to the ER stress and increased apoptosis.

AB Adrenocortical cancer (ACC) is an aggressive malignancy with no available effective treatments; therefore, exploring the molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation and progression of ACC is quite important. Here, we found that the long noncoding RNA urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) was highly expressed in ACC tissues and closely associated with the TNM stage and metastasis of ACC patients. Overexpression of UCA1 significantly promoted the proliferation and suppressed the apoptosis of ACC cells. Mechanism study showed that UCA1 acted as sponge of miR-298 and decreased the expression abundance of miR-298 in ACC cells. Further investigation identified that miR-298 bound the 3'-UTR of the cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) and inhibited the expression of CDK6. Consistently, ectopic expressed UCA1 suppressed miR-298 and up-regulated the expression of CDK6, which promoted the cell cycle progression of ACC cells. Taken together, our results identified the potential oncogenic function of UCA1 in ACC by regulating the miR-298-CDK6 axis.

AB The facultative air-breathing magur catfish (Clarias magur) frequently face different environmental challenges, such as hyper-ammonia, and desiccation stresses in their natural habitats. All these stresses lead to higher accumulation of body ammonia, thereby causing various harmful effects to the fish due to its toxicity. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying ammonia-induced toxicity is yet not clear. In the present study, we used RNA sequencing and utilized a modified method for de novo assembly of the transcriptome to provide an exhaustive study on the transcriptomic alterations of magur catfish in response to high environmental ammonia (HEA; 25 mM NH4Cl). The final contig assembly produced a total of 311,076 unique transcripts (termed as unigenes) with a GC content of 48.3% and the average length of 599 bp. A considerable number of SSR marker associated with these unigenes were also detected. A total of 279,156 transcripts were successfully annotated by using various databases. Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed a total of 3453 and 19,455 genes were differentially expressed in the liver and brain tissues, respectively, in ammonia-treated fish compared to the control. Enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed that several GO and KEGG pathway terms were significantly over-represented. Functional analysis of significantly elevated DEGs demonstrated that ammonia stress tolerance of the magur catfish was associated with quite a few pathways related to immune response, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, as well as few transporter proteins involved with ammonia and urea transport. Both liver and brain tissues showed HEA-mediated oxidative damage with consequent activation of antioxidant machinery. However, elevated ROS levels led to an activation of inflammatory cytokines and thus innate immune response in the liver. Conversely, in the brain ROS-mediated irreversible cell damages activated apoptosis via both p53-Bax-Bcl2 and caspase-mediated pathways. The present study provides a novel understanding of the molecular responses of this air-breathing catfish against the ammonia-induced stressors, which could elucidate the underlying mechanisms of adaptation of this facultative air-breather living under various environmental constraints.

AB Desulfovibrio alaskensis is a Gram-negative bacterial species that belongs to the group of Sulphate Reducing Bacteria (SRB) and presents prophages in genomes, a common characteristic of the genus Desulfovibrio. Genetic material can be transported by outer membrane vesicles, however, no data regarding the production of these vesicles has been reported for D. alaskensis. To verify the expression of D. alaskensis prophages and their involvement with outer membrane vesicles, the DSM16109 strain was used. The DSM16109 strain had three prophages and presented reduced growth after mitomycin C addition when compared to the control culture. This reduction was accompanied by the presence of virus-like particles (VLPs), indicating mitomycin C dependent prophage induction. The increase in the number of cap gene copies and transcriptions of the three prophages was verified in the control sample, however, without the formation of VLPs. Prophage genes were identified in outer membrane vesicles from cultures treated and not treated with mitomycin C. DSM16109 prophages are expressed spontaneously but only in the presence of mitomycin C was it possible to observe VLP formation. Due to the genetic material detection from the prophages within outer membrane vesicles, this property may be related to the horizontal transfer of viral genes.

AB This study was conducted to explore whether polymorphisms of glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) gene affect the prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCIC) after surgical resection. Four single nuCIeotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GLUT3 were investigated in a total of 782 patients with NSCIC who underwent curative surgery. The assoCIation of the SNPs with overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) was analyzed. Among the four SNPs investigated, GLUT3 rs7309332C > T was significantly assoCIated with OS and DFS in multivariate analyses. The SNP was assoCIated with significantly worse OS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04-2.53, P = 0.03, under recessive model), and worse DFS (aHR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.18-2.29, P = 0.003, under recessive model). When stratified by tumor histology, the assoCIation between the GLUT3 rs7309332C > T and OS/DFS was not limited to either squamous cell carCInoma (SCC) or adenocarCInoma (AC), although the significant assoCIation remained only in AC for OS (P = 0.40 for SCC and P = 0.04 for OS) and only in SCC for DFS (P = 0.03 for SCC and P = 0.08 for OS). When AC patients were stratified according to EGFR mutation status, the SNP was significantly assoCIated with DFS in patients with EGFR mutant tumors (aHR = 2.47, 95% CI = 1.15-5.30, P = 0.02, under recessive model), but not in those with EGFR wild-type tumors. This study suggests that genetic variation in GLUT3 may be useful in predicting survival of patients with early stage NSCIC.

AB As a progressive and chronic disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by hyperglycemia with rising prevalence worldwide. The epsilon 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene may be risk factor of severe peripheral neuropathy in T2DM patients. The association of ApoE polymorphism and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in T2DM patients remains largely unknown. Totally 156 T2DM patients with AD and 145 T2DM patients were included. The genotypes and allele frequency of ApoE were analyzed to explore the role of ApoE in AD in T2DM patients. The levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyeride (TG), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) were detected to further investigate mechanism of ApoE. Genotype frequency ratio of genotype epsilon 3/4, epsilon 4/4 and allele epsilon 4 among the T2DM patients with AD was obviously increased. The TC, TG and LDL-C levels of T2DM patients with epsilon 3/4 genotype were higher than those with epsilon 3/3 or epsilon 2/3 genotype and the epsilon 3/4 genotype, while the HDL-C level was on the contrary, suggesting that epsilon 3/4 genotype elevated blood lipid levels in T2DM patients with AD, thus increasing the risk of AD in T2DM patients. ApoE polymorphism was associated with AD in T2DM patients. ApoE epsilon 3/4 genotype was possibly to serve as a risk factor for AD in T2DM patients by enhancing the blood lipid levels.

AB Long non coding RNAs (lncRNA) have been previously found to be involved in important cellular activities like epigenetics, implantation, cell growth etc. in pigs. However, comprehensive analysis of lncRNA in back fat tissues at different developmental stages in pigs is still lacking. In this study we conducted transcriptome analysis in the back fat tissue of a Fl crossbred Korean Native Pig (KNP) x Yorkshire Pig to identify lncRNA. We investigated their role in 16 pigs at two different growth stages; stage 1 (10 weeks, n = 8) and stage 2 (26 weeks, n = 8). After quality assessment of sequencing reads, we got a total of 1,641,165 assembled transcripts out of eight paired end read from each stage. Among them, 6808 lncRNA transcripts were identified by filtering on the basis of multiple parameters like read length >= 200 nucleotides, exon numbers >= 2, FPKM >= 0.5, coding potential score < 0 etc. PFAM and RFAM were used to filter out all possible protein coding genes and housekeeping RNAs respectively. A total of 103 lncRNAs and 1057 mRNAs were found to be differentially expressed (DE) between the two stages (vertical bar log2FC vertical bar > 2, q < 0.05). We also identified 306 genes located around 100 kb upstream and 234 genes downstream around these DE lncRNA transcripts. The expression of top eleven DE lncRNAs (COL4A6, LY7S, MYH2, OXCTI, SMPDL3A, TMEM182, TTC36, RFOOOO4, RFOOO15, RFOOO45, CADM2) had been validating by qRT-PCR. Pathway and GO terms analysis showed that, positive regulation of biosynthetic process, Wnt signaling pathway, cellular protein modification process, and positive regulation of nitrogen compound were differentially enriched. Our results suggested that, KEGG pathways such as protein digestion and absorption, Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) to be significantly enriched in both DE lncRNAs as well as DE mRNAs and involved in back fat tissues development. It also suggests that, identified lncRNAs are involved in regulation of important adipose tissues development pathways.

AB Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system has ushered in a new era of gene therapy. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate precise CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing of the splicing mutation c.919-2A > G in intron 7 of the SLC26A4 gene, which is the second most common causative gene of congenital hearing loss. We designed candidate single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) aimed to direct the targeting of Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 to either exon 7 or exon 8 of SLC26A4. Several of the designed sgRNAs showed targeting activity, with average indel efficiencies ranging from approximately 14% to 25%. The usage of dual sgRNAs delivered both into Neuro2a cells and primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts resulted in the successful removal of large genomic fragments within the target locus. We subsequently evaluated genome editing in the presence of artificial donor templates to induce precise target modification via homology-directed repair. Using this approach, two different donor plasmids successfully introduced silent mutations within the c.919-2A region of Slc26a4 without evident off-target activities. Overall, these results indicate that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated correction of mutations in the Slc26a4 gene is a feasible therapeutic option for restoration of hearing loss.

AB Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) and circular RNAs (circRNA) that sponge miRNAs could indirectly regulate gene expression, contributing to certain biological processes. This study aimed to investigate the role of non coding RNAs in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia reperfusion-injury (MIRI). MIRI in male C578/6J mice was induced by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation occlusion for 30 min, and 4 h of reperfusion. RNA sequencing was performed to obtain the mRNA and non-coding RNA expression profiles of the MIRI and sham groups. Bioinformatic methods were used to analyze the co-expression RNAs, miRNA binding sites and competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) pairs. Differentially expressed RNAs were identified with a cutoff fold change > 2 and p < 0.05. A total of 64 mRNAs were upregulated and 98 mRNAs were downregulated, and 10 lncRNAs were upregulated and 10 lncRNAs were downregulated. All altered (p < 0.05) mRNAs were selected for gene ontology and pathway analysis. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway was enriched in the downregulated genes, and the activation of AMPK was confirmed by western blotting. The lncRNA co-expression network and ceRNA network base on genes in AMPK signaling pathway were then constructed, revealing that ENSMUST00000147762.7 and TUCP_000184 might be key regulators in MIRI induced AMPK activation. The expression levels of AMPK signaling-related RNAs and those involved in the ceRNA network were validated using qRT-PCR. Overall, this study identified potential new targets on AMPK signaling in MIRI.

AB Haemonchus contortus (HC) causes Haemonchosis in sheep and goats, with high mortality and morbidity due to lack of effective vaccine and increasing resistance to anthelmintic drugs. The present study was aimed at developing the 3D model of HCP24 protein and to identify the candidate epitopic peptides for effective humoral and cell-mediated immune-response. The HCP24 protein was homology modelled using the Swiss server and developed model was validated by ERRAT, VERIFY3D, PROQ, RAMPAGE and PROCHECK servers. Linear and prominent antigenic epitopes were predicted by SVMTrip and Immuno-medicine group tool. Conformational B-cell epitopes were predicted by Ellipro. MHC-I and MHC-II binding peptides were predicted by MHCPRED2, MHC2PRED and Propred I server. Proteosomal cleavage sites were predicted by Netchop server, to assess the stability of peptides. Reverse and three frame translation was done by EMBOSS tool. Bepipred and IEDB analysis also confirmed that both the predicted peptides (pep-1 and pep-2) were important antigenic region but pep-1 should have better hydrophobicity and stability. The degree of confidence achieved on scientific validation of the generated 3D model of the protein allows us to prescribe its use for research purpose. We could determine the peptide Pep-1(EDCKCTNCVCSRDEAL) should be a conformational B cell epitope with high antigenic potential and should demonstrate good binding affinity with host MHC-II and MHC-I alleles as well as stability inside host. Thus, it could be an ideal vaccine candidate for developing sub-unit vaccine against the parasite and should be assessed for protective immune response by in vitro and in-vivo studies.

AB This study aims to investigate the different clinically relevant allele variants (allele frequencies) of CYP2D6 gene and to determine whether a specific genotype of CYP2D6 gene (based on genetic polymorphism "allelic types" and combination) have impact on metoprolol effectiveness (clinical outcome) in patients who have acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The study included 250 patients with ACS who were classified into 2 study groups, 125 patients received metoprolol and served as a study group (Group1) and 125 who received no metoprolol therapy (due to contraindication to the medication) and served as a control group (Group 2). Venous blood samples were taken from all participants for DNA extraction. Urine samples were also collected to assess the metabolic ratio using High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique.
   There was significant variation in the distribution of Iraqi patients with respect to CYP2D6 allelic polymorphism as compared to similar patients in other countries. Besides, this significant difference existed in patients' outcome in terms of morbidity and mortality in respect to variable genotypes and phenotypes. We recommend a dose individualization of metoprolol in patients with ACS is essential to improve patients' outcome.

AB Aims: Given the participation of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, we evaluated, in type 1 diabetes (T1D) individuals, the association between diabetic retinopathy (DR) and functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in regulatory regions of two genes belonging to the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) system: rs17883901 in GCLC and rs713041 in GPX4.
   Methods: A cross-sectional case-control study included 288 individuals (61% women, 34[+/- 11] years old, diabetes duration of 22[+/- 9] years, mean [+/- SD]) sorted according to DR stages: absence of DR (ADR), non proliferative DR (NPDR) and proliferative DR (PDR). SNPs were genotyped by real-time PCR using fluorescent labelled probes. Logistic regression models with adjustment for confounding covariates were employed.
   Results: The presence of at least one T-allele of rs17883901 in GCLC was an independent risk factor for PDR (OR 4.13, 95% CI 1.38-13.66, p = 0.014) in a polytomous regression model (PDR versus ADR). The presence of at least one T-allele of rs713041 in GPX4 conferred protection against PDR (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.80, p = 0.017) in female T1D individuals.
   Conclusion: The functional SNPs rs17883901 and rs713041 modulate the risk for PDR in the studied population of T1D individuals, widening the spectrum of candidate genes for this complication.

AB Hybrid vigour, or heterosis, refers to the increased productivity and growth rate of hybrid offsprings relative to the parents. Various heterosis have been well exploited in fish for fisheries. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying heterosis are largely unknown in fish. In this study, two inbred and hybrid lines between the northern snakehead (NS, Channa argus) and blotched snakehead (BS, Channa maculata) were generated. The analysis on various growth traits, including body length, head length, and body height, showed that hybrid fry obviously exhibited a spontaneous growth heterosis over the inbred. Moreover, the methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) analysis revealed that the DNA methylation levels were negatively related to the body growth in all fry. Especially, the DNA methylation levels in the hybrid fry were significantly lower than those in the inbred. Additionally, qRT-PCR showed that the snakehead fish Dnmt3a mRNA was initially detectable in embryos at 12 hpf and gradually increased as developing. Intriguingly, the level of Dnmt3a mRNA expression was found to be closely correlated to the DNA methylation level in embryos/fry. The results of this study firstly demonstrated the correlations between growth heterosis, DNA methylation level and Dnmt3a mRNA expression in fish fry. The findings of this study implied that the hybrids' heterosis formation is probably accompanied by DNA methylation alterations and modulated by Dnmt3a gene in fish. This study would provide new clues for further investigations on mechanisms behind heterosis formation in fish hybrid.

AB The present study reports the isolation and analysis of two novel GH1 beta-glucosidases from the alkalophilic fungus Stachybotrys microspora, using PCR and Nested-PCR. Three major gene fragments were obtained by PCR: the first two are very similar and constitute a novel gene, which was named Smbgl1A, and the third PCR fragment is part of a different gene, named Smbgl1B. The truncated gene sequences were completely filled using the recent partial whole genome sequencing data of S. microspora (data not yet published).
   Moreover, we investigated the relative effects of glucose in comparison to cellulose rather than evaluate their absolute effects.
   In fact, RT-PCR analysis showed that while Smbgl1A was expressed when the fungus was grown in the presence of cellulose but not when grown with glucose, Smbgl1B was equally expressed under both conditions.
   The putative catalytic residues and the conserved glycone binding sites were identified. Zymogram analysis showed the intracellular production of beta-glucosidases in S. microspora. The predicted secondary structure exhibited a classical (beta/alpha)8 barrel fold, showing that both SmBGL1A and SmBGL1B belong to the GH1 family.
   Phylogenetic studies showed that SmBGL1A and SmBGL1B belong to the same branch as beta-glucosidases from Stachybotrys chlorohalonata and Stachybotrys chartarum. However, SmBGL1A and SmBGL1B form two distinct clades.

AB We developed a novel assay system to quantitatively detect amber codon suppression by tRNAs expressed in plant cells. The assay was based on recovery of the expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter, in which a fourth Lys codon (AAG) was changed to a premature amber codon TAG, designated as GFP/amber. Plasmids carrying GFP/amber, suppressor tRNA, and red fluorescent protein (RFF) as an internal control, respectively, were introduced into onion epidermal cells to monitor cell numbers with GFP and RFP fluorescence. First, an amber suppressor tRNA(ser) from tobacco (NtS2) to suppress a TAG codon in GFP mRNA was examined, leading to the recovery of GFP fluorescence. Second, we used two different tRNAs (Le., AtY3II-am and AtY3II-amiG7), both of which are intron-containing amber suppressor tRNAs(Tyr), the former impaired precursor-tRNA splicing but the latter did not, as confirmed previously using two different approaches (Szeykowska-Kulinska and Beier, 1991; Akama and Beier, 2003). As expected, coexpression of GFP/amber with AtY3II-am gave no green fluorescence, but significant fluorescence was observed with AtY3II-amiG7. Then, we applied this system for the analysis of 5'-regulatory sequences of the tRNA(Gln) gene family from Arabidopsis. A 5'-flanking sequence of each of the 17 tRNA(Gln) genes was fused to a coding region of an amber suppressor tRNA(ser) gene (NtS2/amber) and its 3'-flanking sequence. Chimeric tRNA(ser) gene, GFP/amber, and RFP were coexpressed, and the GFP or RFP fluorescence intensity was determined in cells using laser-scanning microscopy. In parallel, 17 kinds of original Arabidopsis tRNA(Gln) genes and their chimeric genes with NtS2/amber were all analyzed in cell-free nuclear extract (Yukawa et al., 1997). Comparison of in vitro and in vivo expression of these chimeric tRNA genes displayed generally similar results, accompanied by a wide range of variance in the expression of each gene. Nevertheless, the expression patterns of several genes were clearly the opposite of each other comparing between the two different system, demonstrating the importance of in vivo systems in the study on tRNA expression in plants.

AB Spray drying is a well-established technology to produce inhalable dry powders. However, the amorphous nature of the particles typically obtained from the process can lead to physically and chemically unstable products. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether spray-drying could be used as a manufacturing method to produce co-amorphous drug amino acid powders with high physical stability and inhalable particulate properties. Budesonide (BUD), a compound for the treatment of lung inflammation, was co-spray-dried at a 1:1 M ratio with arginine (ARG) to produce co-amorphous powders. Two experimental factors, the solid concentration (0.85, 1.00 and 1.13%, w/v) and the ethanol concentration (55 and 75%, v/v) of the feed solution were varied to investigate the formation of co-amorphous BUD-ARG. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), modulated temperature differential scanning calorimetry (mDSC) and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) were used for solid state characterization. The particle morphology, the median mass aerodynamic diameter and the aerodynamic properties of the resulting co-amorphous powders were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS), and a next generation impactor (NGI), respectively. Furthermore, the physical stability of the obtained dry powder was examined. The co-spraydried BUD-ARG samples prepared within the experimental range were predominantly amorphous. However, it was observed that while using the feed solution with both high solid and ethanol concentrations, some residual crystallinity related to budesonide was observed. The formation of co-amorphous BUD-ARG, rather than two separate amorphous phases, was confirmed by mDSC analyses. In addition, FTIR analyses indicated that hydrogen bonding occurs between the carbonyl groups of BUD and the amide groups of ARG in the co-amorphous BUD-ARG mixtures. The NGI results indicated that the particulate properties of the co-spray-dried co-amorphous BUD-ARG were at an inhalable range, with emitted doses > 80%, and fine particle fractions > 50%. In addition, the co-amorphous BUD-ARG was more physically stable than spray-dried BUD when stored at room temperature under dry conditions. This study demonstrated that spray drying is a useful manufacturing approach to produce physically stable co-amorphous dry powders for inhalation purposes.

AB Microneedle technology offers a viable means of delivering biologically active pharmaceutical agents across the skin in a minimally invasive and virtually pain free manner. Previous work detailed the first successful transdermal delivery of a model peptide drug, polymyxin b, utilising a dissolving polymer-based microneedle system. The focus of this study was to examine the ability of a dissolving microneedle system to deliver a range of peptides of different sizes and properties. Analogue versions of 2 existing therapeutic peptides; pentagastrin and sincalide, were synthesised utilising Fmoc based solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) chemistry techniques and once successfully synthesised and purified, the peptide analogues were characterised using LC-MS. The peptide analogues were then incorporated into PVP/trehalose microneedle formulations. Skin permeation testing, in addition to skin penetration testing, was carried out to determine the effectiveness of the microneedle system to deliver the peptide analogues through porcine skin. The results obtained from these studies were then compared with the permeation results obtained utilising polymyxin B as the peptide drug cargo to evaluate the PVP/trehalose microneedle system's suitability to successfully deliver therapeutic peptides. Results indicated that the microneedle system successfully systemically delivered a higher overall percentage of the encapsulated peptides at an initially faster rate than peptide loaded control discs and in therapeutically relevant concentrations.

AB The target of the current study is to formulate letrozole loaded nanoemulsion (LET-NE) for the direct nose to brain delivery to reduce peripheral effects of letrozole (LET). LET-NE is compared against intraperitoneally administered free LET in kainic acid (KA) induced status epilepticus (SE) in mice. LET loaded nanoemulsion (LET-NE) was prepared by aqueous microtitration method using Triacetin, Tween 80 and PEG-400 as the oil phase, surfactant, and co-surfactant. Nanoemulsion was studied for droplet size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential, percentage transmittance, drug content, surface morphology. TEM images of developed formulation demonstrated spherical droplets with a mean diameter of 95.59 +/- 2.34 nm, PDI of 0.162 +/- 0.012 and zeta potential of -7.12 +/- 0.12 mV respectively. In in-vitro and ex-vivo drug release, LET-NE showed prolonged drug release profile as compared to suspension. SE was induced by KA (10 mg/kg, i.p.) in Swiss albino mice. Behavioral seizure monitoring, biochemical estimations, and histopathological examination were performed. The onset time of SE was significantly enhanced and % incidence of SE was reduced by intranasal administration of LET-NE as compared to KA and LET administered intraperitoneally. Biochemical estimations revealed that LET-NE effectively decreased levels of 17-beta estradiol while the levels of 5 alpha-Dihydrotestosterone (5 alpha-DHT) and 3 alpha-androstanediol (3 alpha-Diol) were significantly increased in the hippocampus. In cresyl violet staining LET-NE showed better protection of the hippocampus from neurotoxicity induced by KA as compared to LET. Also, in gamma scintigraphy of mouse brain, intranasal administration of nanoemulsion exhibited the presence of high concentration of LET. The study demonstrates the anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effect of LET-NE probably by inhibition of aromatization of testosterone into 17-beta estradiol, proconvulsant, and diverting the pathway into the synthesis of testosterone metabolites, 3 alpha-Diol with known anticonvulsant and neuroprotective action. Brain targeting of LET-NE showed better anticonvulsant and neuroprotective action than LET.

ID PENETRATION; ABSORPTION; BIOAVAILABILITY; ENHANCEMENT
AB After application to the skin surface, a topical formulation is submitted to changes in composition produced by evaporation of volatile components, penetration of components into the skin and extraction of skin components ("vehicle metamorphosis"). The aim of this work was to study the effect of vehicle metamorphosis on skin delivery from microemulsions containing triamcinolone acetonide. The microemulsions were prepared and characterized for water evaporation kinetics, in vitro release and skin permeation and retention. Skin retention experiments were performed on full thickness pig ear skin, in both occluded infinite and un-occluded finite dose conditions. For comparison purposes, two creams, the commercial Ledercort (R) and a vanishing cream, were tested. With triamcinolone acetonide water evaporation does not modify skin retention, probably for the lipophilic nature of the drug. However, if water is eliminated from the microemulsions, the performance is reduced, probably because drug partitioning from vehicle to stratum corneum is disfavored. If a water-soluble drug (methyl prednisolone sodium succinate) is used, infinite dose application in occlusive conditions increases in a significant way the amount of drug retained in the skin. The involved mechanisms are probably stratum corneum swelling and increase of stratum corneum/viable epidermis partitioning.

AB The aim of the present study was to assess the potential of biocompatible polymeric nanosheets as topical and transdermal drug-delivery devices. Nanosheets are two-dimensional nanostructures with a thickness in the nanometer order, and their extremely large aspect ratios result in unique properties, including high transparency, flexibility, and adhesiveness. Nanosheet formulations containing betamethasone valerate (BV) as a model drug and consisting of poly (L-lactic acid) or poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid were fabricated through a spin-coatingassisted layer-by-layer method using a water-soluble sacrificial membrane. The fabricated formulations could incorporate and release higher amounts of BV compared with a commercial ointment, and the amounts could be controlled by the polymers used, the amount of BV added, and the use of controlled-release membranes. The presence of BV had a minimal effect on thickness, transparency, adhesiveness, and moisture permeability of nanosheets, permitting their application to any area of skin for a long period of time. Therefore, this biocompatible polymeric nanosheet formulation represents a novel and promising topical and transdermal drug delivery device, which has potential to deliver drugs regardless of the area of skin.

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer among both men and women worldwide. New therapeutic strategies involving cytoreductive surgery and intra-peritoneal chemotherapy could lead to a definitive cure in some cases. However, postoperative intra-abdominal adhesion can cause further complications. In this study, hyaluronic acid (HA)- and carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMCNa)-based novel cross-linked hydrogels (HC hydrogels) were synthesized and fully characterized. We demonstrated that varied compositions of HA and CMCNa altered the microstructure, rheology, and degradation behavior of hydrogels. Pre-constructed hydrogels were further loaded with oxaliplatin to prevent intra-abdominal adhesion following chemotherapy. Sustained release of oxaliplatin was observed from hydrogels compared that from solutions, which release drugs through diffusion, following the Higuchi and Korsmeyer-Peppas models. Moreover, low adhesion scores in an in vivo SD rat model demonstrated inhibition of intra-peritoneal adhesion in response to HC hydrogels. Therefore, HC hydrogels offer a novel formulation strategy for providing an intra-abdominal anti-adhesion barrier after cytoreductive surgery and intra-peritoneal chemotherapy for CRC treatment.

ID ENHANCEMENT; FORMULATION; ABSORPTION; EFFICACY
AB Quercetin, a natural polyphenol with strong antioxidant activity, was loaded in Eudragit-coated liposomes conceived for intestinal delivery. Eudragit was used to form a protective shell on the surface of liposomes to resist gastric environment and allow the delivery of quercetin to the intestine. The physico-chemical properties of the liposomes were assessed by light scattering and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. Small, spherical, uni- and bilamellar liposomes were produced, with the presence of multilamellar structures in Eudragit-coated liposomes. The Eudragit coating increased the physical stability of the vesicular system in fluids mimicking the gastrointestinal environment. Further, the incorporation of quercetin in the vesicular system did not affect its intrinsic antioxidant activity, as DPPH radical was almost completely inhibited, and the vesicles were also capable of ensuring optimal protection against oxidative stress in human intestinal cells by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The proposed approach based on quercetin vesicular formulations may be of value in the treatment of pathological conditions associated with intestinal oxidative stress.

AB Post-operative adhesion is a common cause of several complications including intestinal obstruction, chronic pelvic pain and/or infertility. Adhesions are fibrous bands that result from the inflammatory reactions due to peritoneum damage. The current study focused on designing an effective anti-inflammatory loaded barrier for the prevention of post-operative adhesions. The proposed method is based on the use of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), cryobarrier loaded with Ibuprofen (Ibu). Anti-adhesive Ibu-cryobarriers were prepared in different forms, and subjected to in-vitro evaluation comprising; drug release rate, maximum swelling index, morphological examination using scanning electron microscope (SEM), fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and mechanical properties. Optimized cryobarriers were further investigated for their in-vivo effectiveness in preventing post-operative adhesions in female Sprague-Dawley rats. All formulations showed appropriate physical and morphological characteristics, in-vitro controlled sustained drug release profiles during a period of seven days with acceptable maximum swelling index. Invivo, all cryobarriers were equivalent to each other concerning serum or tissue parameter. However, morphological and histopathological evaluations revealed that both xerocryogel and lyophilized cryofilms are more effective than the cryogel in prevention of post-operative peritoneal adhesions. The current study showed the possibility of preparing drug loaded cryobarriers using simple technique with an effective in vivo post-operative adhesion prevention.

AB Potential usage of biodegradable and biocompatible polymeric nanofibers is the most attention grabbing topic for the drug delivery system. In order to fabricate ultrafine fibers, electrospinning, one of the well-known techniques, has been extensively studied in the literature. In the present study, the objective is to achieve the optimum blend of hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymers to be used as a drug delivery vehicle and also to obtain the optimum amount of doxycycline (DOXH) to reach the optimum release. In this case, the biodegradable and biocompatible synthetic polymers, poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), were blended with different ratios for the production of DOXH-loaded electrospun PCL/PEO membranes using electrospinning technique, which is a novel attempt. The fabricated membranes were subsequently characterized to optimize the blending ratio of polymers by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and water contact angle analysis. After the characterization studies, different amounts of DOXH were loaded to the optimized blend of PCL and PEO to investigate the release of DOXH from the membrane used as a drug delivery vehicle. In vitro drug release studies were performed, and in vitro drug release kinetics were assessed to confirm the usage of these nanofiber materials as efficient drug delivery vehicles. The results indicated that 3.5% DOXH-loaded (75:25 w/w) PCL/PEO is the most acceptable membrane to provide prolonged release rather than immediate release of DOXH.

AB Polymer/bioceramic composite micro-particles have been used for bone regeneration in order to address weak mechanical properties/bioactivity of polymers and to enable easy filling of irregular bone defects through minimally invasive injection procedure. The purpose of this study was to determine whether injectable apatite-coated atorvastatin (AT) loaded Poly (d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) micro-particles can support osteogenic differentiation of adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells(ADMSCs). Particle preparation conditions (oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion), were carefully adjusted to yield uniform particles of about 20-50 mu m in diameter. Taking a solid in oil-in water (S/O/W) emulsion strategy, it became possible to load atorvastatin (10 wt%) in the micro-particles without deformation. The particles were then coated with HAp by incubation in 10X simulated body fluid (SBF). The apatite coating layer was similar to apatite in natural bone, as demonstrated by SEM, XRD, and FTIR analyses. Adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs), were cultured on the micro-particles and calcium deposition measurement was performed through Alizarin Red assay. Initial cell adhesion did not differ significantly between the samples and the control. The strongest osteogenic differentiation was observed on PLGA-AT-HAp in both the osteogenic and non osteogenic culture media, while PLGA-AT slightly decreased and PLGA-HAp slightly increased osteogenic differentiation of the cells, indicating suitability of PLGA-AT-HAp as an injectable tissue engineering system.

Although it has shown therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials, there are many side effects related to its systemic distribution. In this work, we have incorporated vismodegib to ultradeformable liposomes in order to obtain a nano-drug delivery system via topical route, which could be useful to reduce systemic distribution -and consequently side effects- while achieving a viable epidermis-specific target where neoplastic events of BCC develop. Vismodegib was loaded into liposomes composed of soy phosphatidylcholine and sodium cholate, and the obtained formulation was characterized by different techniques, both experimental and computational. Several analyses were performed,with a special focus on the interaction of the drug with the liposomal membrane. Additionally, the penetration of Vismodegib delivered by ultradeformable liposomes was assessed on human skin explants. This is one of the first works that propose the topical route for Vismodegib and the first, to our knowledge, in stabilizing this active into a nano-drug delivery system specifically designed for penetrating the stratum corneum impermeable barrier.

AB The recognition of a-galactosylceramide (alpha GC), a high-affinity CD1d antigen, by the invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) lymphocytes results in potent immunostimulatory responses that have been exploited in advanced cancer patients. Therefore, to improve alpha GC biological activity, several studies vectorized this agonist in PLGA and/or PEG-based nanoparticles. Despite promising findings, these approaches require several steps, from organic solvent decontamination through extrusion in membrane systems. Using a nano spray dryer, we vectorized alpha GC into a cationic copolymer (dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate and methyl methacrylate - DBM) in a single step process, free of organic solvent. This methodology allowed the production of stable alpha GC-vectorized nanoparticles (DBM + alpha GC) with a more potent biological activity than the free agonist. DBM nanoparticles improved in vivo alpha GC loading into the CD1d molecule and induced a higher frequency of IFN-gamma-expressing iNKT cells. Consequently, mice treated with DBM + alpha GC presented higher levels of serum IFN-gamma than those treated with free agonist. Also, vectorized nanoparticles improved alpha GC ability to control the growth of murine lung metastatic carcinoma. Thus, this is the first study showing that nano spray dryer technology is a simple and alternative approach to enhance iNKT responses.

AB The aim of this work was to design and evaluate novel cationized hyaluronic acid coated spanlastics (CHASVs), with the immunosuppressive peptide cyclosporine A (CsA) as the model drug. CHASVs exhibited ideal size, zeta potential, pH, osmolarity and entrapment efficiency. The developed CHASVs provided a surface tension of 34.98 +/- 0.19 mN/m, a contact angle of 21.07 +/- 3.56 degrees and a viscosity of 9-12 mPa.s, which reflected favorable wetting and bioadhesion properties. From the in vitro release study, the sustain release property could also be seen. These proved the availability of CsA by ocular delivery was improved. With an apparent permeation coefficient of 5.22 x 10(-6) cm/s and CsA residual of 312.18 +/- 1.34 mu g/g, CHASVs proved to enhance corneal permeation and accumulation of CsA compared with commercial emulsions. In vivo Draize test showed no signs of acute and chronic ocular toxicity of CHASVs formulations to the eyes of rabbits. Finally, schirmer tear test, tear ferning test and histologic analysis reflected that CHASVs showed significant therapeutic effect and improved tear production in dry eye. Results revealed that CHASVs could be a promising delivery system for CsA and employed as an ideal alternative to commercial emulsions for the treatment of dry eye syndrome.

ID FORMULATIONS
AB A curved area with embossment on an analgesic tablet with three APIs is imaged with a Raman instrument equipped with hardware options that allow for continuous focus adjustment and very fast acquisition of micro-Raman spectra, about sixty spectra per second in this study. Univariate, self-modelling curve resolution, and regression derived images via the pure component spectra are obtained for all three APIs. The quality of the images and reasons for thresholding are discussed, as well as the relation between the histograms of the images and respective thresholds. The univariate image of the API of lowest concentration (caffeine) is found to be most affected by the Raman signal of the more abundant components, which is much less noticeable in the multivariate images. Particle size analysis is conducted on the thresholded caffeine images only, as the other two components are too abundant for such type of analysis. Depending on the method used for imaging, the area coverage for caffeine varies from 1% in univariate to 4% in regression images.

AB Herein, an injectable formulation composed of a low molecular weight gelator (LMWG) based hydrogel and drug-loaded polymeric nanocapsules (NCs) is described. The NCs, made of hyaluronic acid and polyglutamic acid and loaded with C14-Gemcitabine (GEM C14), showed a size of 40 and 80 nm and a encapsulation efficiency > 90%. These NCs exhibited a capacity to control the release of the encapsulated drug for > 1 month. GEM C14-loaded NCs showed activity against various cancer cell lines in vitro; cell growth inhibition by 50% (GI(50)) values of 15 +/- 6, 10 +/- 9, 13 +/- 3 and 410 +/- 463 nM were obtained in HCT 116, MIA PaCa-2, Panc-1 and Panc-1 GEM resistant cell lines respectively. Nanocomposite hydrogels were prepared using the LMWG - N4-octanoyl-2'-deoxycytidine and loaded for the first time with polymeric NCs. 2% and 4% w/v nanocapsule concentrations as compared to 8% w/v NC concentrations with 2% and 3% w/v gelator concentrations gave mechanically stronger gels as determined by oscillatory rheology. Most importantly, the nanocomposite formulation reformed instantly into a gel after injection through a needle. Based on these properties, the nanocomposite gel formulation has potential for the intratumoural delivery of anticancer drugs.

AB Determining the stability of downstream process (DSP) intermediates is an extremely important parameter used to maintain product quality attributes within their acceptance ranges. The IgG4 monoclonal antibody studied (mAb1) showed aggregation under acidic conditions, inhibiting the use of low pH treatment to inactivate endogenous retroviruses, and poor virus filtration performance. Both manufacturing steps are included in mAb DSP for viral clearance. The impact of several new compounds on the aggregation and stabilization of mAb1 in process intermediate pools encountered during these critical DSP steps was investigated.
   Results showed that, in the presence of a protein stabilizer at pH 3.2, 27% less aggregation was observed compared to controls, during the low pH treatment for viral inactivation.
   The impact of a novel protein stabilizer on virus filter throughput during mAb1 filtration was compared to Larginine using an innovative high-throughput automation technique. Compared to control experiments without additives, conditions were found where a 70% increase in filter volumetric throughput was achieved in the presence of the novel stabilizer, and a 56% decrease in volumetric throughput observed with L-arginine.
   These findings present the possibility of using these novel compounds to stabilize proteins during DSP and permitting the use of platform DSP elements such as low pH treatment and high-throughput virus filtration to challenging and unstable proteins.

AB Nanotechnology-based platforms have gained a growing interest in skin wound healing. Herein, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of different shapes (rods and spheres) and surface modifications (neutral, cationic and anionic charged polymers) were synthesized, characterized and loaded into a thermosensitive hydrogel (poloxamer 407). AuNPs-hydrogels exhibited excellent colloidal stability and demonstrated slow and prolonged release behavior over a 48-h of exposure using in vitro model. Hydrogels of poly ethylene glycol (PEG)-gold nanorods (AuNRs) and cationic poly allyl amine hydrochloride (PAH)-AuNRs demonstrated remarkable wound healing properties upon topical application on wounds using an animal model. PEGylated and cationic charged-AuNRs hydrogels have enhanced skin re-epithelization and collagen deposition after 14 days of daily wound treatment compared to controls, and they affected the gene expression of several inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. Hydrogels of PEG-AuNRs and PAH-AuNRs exhibited potent in vitro antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). Furthermore, AuNPs of different shapes and surface modifications demonstrated low percentages of deposition into the main body organs after 21 days of daily wound treatment. Hydrogels of AuNRs could be a promising nano-platform for wound healing.

AB Various wet ball nanomilling-screening tools for poorly soluble APIs are available which differ in their milling principle, batch size and number of samples. Here, the transferability of results from screening (small to medium-scale) to pharmaceutical production (largescale) was investigated. We ball milling in a dual centrifuge (DC) (10-100 mg API, 40 samples in parallel) was used to identify stable nanoformulations. In addition different sized agitator bead mills were used for scale-up to industrial scales. DC-and small-scale agitator milling (AM) resulted in small and virtually identical API-particles. Additionally, similar API-particles were obtained using two different sized agitator bead mills (batch size 1.5 and 30 kg) and applying comparable specific grinding energies (SGE). The SGE used in the trials represents the grinding limit for this API-suspension. Using lower SGEs, AM results in larger API-particles. All used milling tools had no influence on the APIs crystal structure and wear of grinding media (Zr/Y) is low. The study confirmed the importance to choose the right formulation and process parameters, which positively affect grinding efficacy, particle size distribution and wear contamination. The excellent comparability of results obtained from DC-milling and AM significantly reduces the duration for successful and predictable formulation development.

AB Nanoparticles (NP) have gained importance as drug delivery systems for pharmaceutical challenging drugs. Their size properties allow passive targeting of cancer tissue by exploiting the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Furthermore, surface modifications enable an active drug targeting for diseased regions in the human body. Besides the advantages, the drug release from commonly used biodegradable NP is mostly depending on physiological circumstances. Hence, there is a need for a more controllable drug release. The use of light-responsive polymers is an innovative conception enabling a more distinct drug release by an external light stimulus. The idea provides potential for an increase in efficiency and safety of local therapies. In this study, innovative light-sensitive NP were investigated for a photodynamic therapy (PDT) of gastrointestinal tumors. Nanoparticles based on a newly developed light-responsive polycarbonate (LrPC) and poly(lactic-co-glycolicacid) (PLGA) were loaded with the approved photosensitizer 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(m-hydroxyphenyl)chlorin (mTHPC). Mucus penetrating properties were obtained by surface PEGylation of the nanoparticles either by using LrPC in combination with a PEGylated PLA (PEG-PLA) or by a combination with PEGylated LrPC (LrPC-PEG). Cytotoxic potential in dependency of a light-induced drug release was investigated in different cytotoxicity assays. Intracellular accumulation in mucus producing colon-carcinoma cell line HT-29-MTX was analysed by HPLC and confocal laser microscopy.

AB Roller compaction is a low cost granulation process which application is sometimes limited by the granular loss of compactability and reduced drug dissolution rate. Hence, the design of a robust manufacturing process is key in order to ensure quality of tablets. In this study, for ibuprofen tablets with high drug loading (< 7% excipients), the correlations between two critical process parameters (CPPs), namely roller force during granulation and compaction pressure during tabletting, and several critical quality attributes (CQAs) were investigated using a design of experiment (DoE) approach. Multivariate analysis (MVA) was utilized to identify the best regression model to predict CQAs such as disintegration, dissolution, weight uniformity, hardness, porosity and tensile strength for 200 and 600 mg ibuprofen tablets. The tabletting compaction pressure had a greater impact on the aforementioned CQAs than compactor roller force. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) correlation loading plot showed that compaction pressure was directly related to disintegration time, tensile strength and hardness, and inversely related to both the percentage of drug dissolved and porosity. The inverse correlations were observed for the roller force applied during dry granulation. Amongst all the regression models constructed, multiple linear regression (MLR) showed the best correlation between CPPs and CQAs.

AB In order to prevent common hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel injections (Taxol), we previously reported an ionic liquid-mediated paclitaxel (IL-PTX) formulation with small particle size and narrow size distribution. The preliminary work showed high PTX solubility in the IL, and the formulation demonstrated similar antitumor activity to Taxol, while inducing a smaller hypersensitivity effect in in vitro cell experiments. In this study, the stability of the IL-PTX formulation was monitored by quantitative HPLC analysis, which showed that IL-PTX was more stable at 4 degrees C than at room temperature. The in vivo study showed that the IL-PTX formulation could be used in a therapeutic application as a biocompatible component of a drug delivery system. To assess the in-vivo biocompatibility, IL or IL-mediated formulations were administered intravenously by maintaining physiological buffered conditions (neutral pH and isotonic salt concentration). From in vivo pharmacokinetics data, the IL-PTX formulation was found to have a similar systemic circulation time and slower elimination rate compared to cremophor EL mediated paclitaxel (CrEL-PTX). Furthermore, in vivo antitumor and hypersensitivity experiments in C57BL/6 mice revealed that IL-PTX had similar antitumor activity to CrEL-PTX, but a significantly smaller hypersensitivity effect compared with CrEL-PTX. Therefore, the IL-mediated formulation has potential to be an effective and safe drug delivery system for PTX.

AB Assessing physical stability of drugs is important both in the development as well as in the production phase in the pharmaceutical industry. We used nanomechanical infrared (NAM-IR) spectroscopy based on photothermal response of a nanomechanical resonator, to investigate the solid state forms of tadalafil (TAD), under various storage conditions in sub-micron thin films. The amorphous TAD was stable, when kept at normal storage conditions of 24 degrees C, 45% relative humidity (RH) and shielded from light, however, it crystallized after four days when it was at stress storage conditions (40 degrees C, 70% RH, and direct sunlight). Additionally, we found that the signals recorded with NAM-IR were comparable with the attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and that NAM-IR proved to be a suitable and time efficient method when evaluating TAD in sub 500 nm layers.

AB We propose a polymeric nanovehicles (PNVs)-based enhanced transdermal delivery platform. A technical advance can be found in that delivery efficiency is significantly enhanced by effective adhesion of PNVs to the cell membrane, which is characterized noninvasively by using a confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM)-based skin visualization technique. To this end, the PNVs with a soft core phase were fabricated through co-assembly of two amphiphilic triblock copolymers, poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(epsilon-caprolactone)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEOb-PCL-b-PEO) and poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(propylene oxide)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO). The softness of PNVs was tuned successfully, while maintaining the particle size at similar to 110 nm, by incorporation of PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO into the PNVs to a volume fraction of 0.3. Through an ex vivo skin penetration test, we showed that transactivating transcriptional activator (TAT)-decorated soft PNVs could not only exert strong adhesion to skin but also increase cellular uptake, leading to a transdermal delivery efficiency that is twice that of a hard PNV control. Moreover, CLSM-based noninvasive visualization of a fluorescent drug probe in the skin showed that the adhesiveness and softness of the PNVs contributed directly to the enhancement of transdermal delivery.

AB Encapsulation of protein vaccines in biodegradable nanoparticles (NP) increases T-cell expansion after mucosal immunization but requires incorporating a suitable immunostimulant to increase long-lived memory T-cells. EP67 is a clinically viable, host-derived peptide agonist of the C5a receptor that selectively activates antigen presenting cells over neutrophils. We previously found that encapsulating EP67-conjugated CTL peptide vaccines in NP increases long-lived memory subsets of CTL after respiratory immunization. Thus, we hypothesized that alternatively conjugating EP67 to the NP surface can increase long-lived mucosal and systemic memory T-cells generated by encapsulated protein vaccines. We found that respiratory immunization of naive female C57BL/6 mice with LPS-free ovalbumin (OVA) encapsulated in PLGA 50:50 NP (similar to 380 nm diameter) surface-conjugated with similar to 0.1 wt% EP67 through 2 kDa PEG linkers (i) increased T-cell expansion and long-lived memory subsets of OVA(323-339)-specific CD4(+) and OVA(257-264)-specific CD8a(+) T-cells in the lungs (CD44(HI)/CD127/KLRG1) and spleen (CD44(HI)/CD127/KLRG1/CD62L) and (ii) decreased peak CFU of OVA-expressing L. monocytogenes (LMOVA) in the lungs, liver, and spleen after respiratory challenge vs. encapsulation in unmodified NP. Thus, conjugating EP67 to the NP surface is one approach to increase the generation of long-lived mucosal and systemic memory T-cells by encapsulated protein vaccines after respiratory immunization.

AB Intranasal delivery has shown to circumvent blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and deliver the drugs into the CNS at a higher rate and extent than other conventional routes. The mechanism of drug transport from nose-to-brain is not fully understood yet, but several neuronal pathways are considered to be involved. Intranasal nanoemulsion for brain targeting is investigated extensively. Higher brain distribution of drug after administering intranasal nanoemulsion was established by many researchers. Issues with nasomucosal clearance are solved by formulating modified nanoemulsion; for instance, mucoadhesive nanoemulsion or in situ nanoemulgel. However, no intranasal nanoemulsion for brain targeted drug delivery has been able to cross the way from 'benches to bed-side' of patients. Possibilities of toxicity by repeated administration, irregular nasal absorption during the diseased condition, use of a high amount of surfactants are few of the persisting challenges that need to overcome in coming days. Understanding the ways how current developments has solved some challenges is necessary. At the same time, the future direction of the research on intranasal nanoemulsion should be figured out based on existing challenges. This review is focused on the current developments of intranasal nanoemulsion with special emphasis on the existing challenges that would help to set future research direction.

AB Despite being in routine for onco-diagnostics for years, the applicability of nucleosidic molecular imaging probes is severely restricted in neurological applications due to their low permeability across blood-brain-barrier (BBB). For extending nucleoside tracers utility for neuro-onco early diagnostics, suitable modification which enhances their BBB permeation needs investigation. Among various modifications, lipidization of nucleosides has been reported to enhance cellular permeability. Extending the concept, the aim was to exemplify the possibility of lipidized nucleosides as potential brain tracer with capability to cross intact BBB and evaluate as metal based neuro-imaging SPECT agent. Uridine based non-lipidic (NSDAU) and di-C15-ketal appended lipidic (NLDPU) ligands were conjugated to chelator, DTPA (DTPA-NSDAU and DTPA-NLDAU) using multi-step chemistry. The ligands were evaluated in parallel for comparative physical and biological parameters. Additionally, effects of enhanced lipophilicity on UV-absorption, acid strength, fluorescence and non-specific protein binding were evaluated. Fluorescence quenching of BSA indicated appreciable interaction of DTPA-NL(DAU )with protein only above 10 mM without inducing conformational changes. In addition, DTPA-NLDPU was found to be haemato-compatible and cytocompatible with low dose-dependent toxicity in HEK-cells. The chelator DTPA was used for Tc-99m-complexation for SPECT imaging. Optimized Tc-99m-radiolabeling parameters resulted in quantitative ( >= 97%) labeling with good stability parameters in in-vitro serum and cysteine challenge studies. We demonstrate that the nucleolipid radiotracer (Tc-99m-DTPA-NLDPU) was successfully able to permeate the BBB with brain uptake of 0.2% ID/g in normal mice as compared to 0.06% ID/g uptake of Tc-99m-DTPA-NSDAU at 5 min. Blood kinetics indicate biphasic profile and t1/2(distribution) 46 min for Tc-99m-DTPA-NLDPU. The preferential accumulation of Tc-99m-DTPA-NLDPU in brain tumor intracranial xenograft indicate the targeting capability of the nucleoside. We conclude that as first-of-its-kind, this work presents the potential of the biocompatible nucleolipidic system for brain targeting and early diagnostics.

AB In this paper, the lyotropic liquid crystals formed in SL/IP/H2O system were prepared as a drug carrier system to encapsulate polyphenols. The components and introduction of drug had influences in the structure and rheological properties of lyotropic liquid crystals. The structure underwent a phase transition from lamellar phase (L alpha) to L alpha + H-II (reverse hexagonal phase) mixed phases and micelle by increasing its IP/H2O mass ratio from 5/35 to 20/20 and 35/5, consistent with the transition from solid-like properties to viscous fluid properties. For the L alpha + H-II phase, the loading of DMY induced the structural transition to the H-II phase, confirmed by SAXS results. This may be due to the penetration of DMY into the hydrophobic tails of surfactants. The in vitro release kinetic resulted that the release of drug in L alpha was associated with diffusional mass transport and matrix swelling. While the release behavior of DMY in H-II phase was predominantly controlled by concentration diffusion. These relationships among structure, rheology and release kinetics should be conducive to further design the drug sustained carrier system formed by lyotropic liquid crystals.

AB We performed in vivo/ex vivo/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) fluorescence imaging of near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF)-labeled siRNA (Cy5.5-siGL3) in mice to investigate the validity of each fluorescence imaging result as the biodistribution/biostability assessment of siRNA. Statistically significant correlations could be obtained between the in vivo and ex vivo fluorescence intensities of Cy5.5 in the relevant regions/tissues, except the lung region/tissue after intravenous administration. On PAGE fluorescence images with the naked formulation, there was no band corresponding to intact Cy5.5-siGL3 from all the tissues evaluated after intravenous administration, indicating that the fluorescence detected by in vivo and ex vivo fluorescence imaging was derived from degraded Cy5.5-siGL3 or free Cy5.5 cleaved from Cy5.5-siGL3. However, the band was detected from the lungs after intratracheal administration of the naked formulation, confirming higher stability of siRNA on the respiratory epithelium than in the blood. Regarding the polyethyleneimine formulation, the band was detected from all the tissues evaluated after intravenous administration and from the lungs after intratracheal administration, verifying the enhanced stability of siRNA in the body. These results clearly indicated the necessity of comprehensive analysis from in vivo/ex vivo/PAGE fluorescence imaging to precisely assess the distribution and stability of NIRF-labeled oligonucleotides including siRNA in the body.

AB The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of non-ionic surfactants to inhibit MRP2-mediated transport in vitro in MDCKII MRP2 cells. Transport studies across MDCKII MRP2 cell monolayers were performed using H-3-etoposide and H-3-digoxin. 19 different non-ionic surfactants, including several polysorbates (PS), cremophor EL, vitamin E-TPGS, and n-nonyl beta-D-glucopyranoside (NG), were investigated. Barrier function of the cells was investigated measuring TEER and transport of C-14-glycine. The amount of isotope was quantified using liquid scintillation counting. In MDCKII MRP2 cells a polarized transport of etoposide and digoxin in the secretory (basolateral to apical) direction with efflux ratios of 5.5 +/- 0.7 and 18.5 +/- 4.2, respectively, was measured. P-gp inhibitors such as valspodar and zosuquidar did not affect etoposide transport, and furthermore PS20 decreased secretory transport of digoxin, but not of etoposide. Transport of etoposide was therefore mainly MRP2-mediated and used as a probe to investigate pharmaceutical excipients. Non-ionic surfactants did not modulate etoposide transport across intact cell monolayers of MRP2 overexpressing MDCKII cells, although preliminary studies suggest that most were able to alter MRP2-mediated efflux of the fluorescent 5-chloromethylfluorescein (CMF). In conclusion, etoposide transport across MDCKII MRP2 cells was modulated by cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of MRP2 and P-gp, but not by specific P-gp inhibitors (valspodar and zosuquidar), which suggests that etoposide transport is primarily influenced by MRP2. In addition, commonly used non-ionic surfactants did not decrease MRP2-mediated etoposide transport in MDCKII MRP2 cells. These results suggest that etoposide transport in MDCKII MRP2 cells is a model system to investigate MRP2 interactions, and that surfactants may not have a large potential for increasing oral bioavailability of drugs through inhibition of MRP2 transport activity.

AB Using tadalafil (TD) as a representative of heat-sensitive drug with high melting point and strong crystallization tendency, we observed that recrystallization of the prepared amorphous materials during extrusion can result in failure of amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) extrusion. Such recrystallization process of amorphous TD during reheating process was investigated systematically. Our results show that spray-dried amorphous TD sample is more prone to recrystallize (occurs from 150 degrees C) in comparison to the melt-quenched amorphous TD sample (recrystallizes from 190 degrees C). Poor stability of the spray-dried TD sample is likely due to an excessive amount of available surface area. Co-extruding Soluplus with spray-dried amorphous TD at 160 degrees C could yield ASD at 10% drug loading and crystalline solid dispersion above 20% drug loading. The method that spray drying 20% TD with 80% Soluplus and then extruding the spray-dried sample can obtain ASD at 20% drug loading at 160 degrees C, 142 degrees C lower than the melting point of TD (302 degrees C). More importantly, the samples prepared by such strategy exhibited a substantially improved bioavailability compared to the samples that were prepared by either spray-dried or hot-melt extruded processes.

AB It is important to quantify amorphous solid in active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) of formulations to guarantee high-quality pharmaceutical products. In this study, we aimed to quantify amorphous solid in API by transmission Raman spectroscopy (TRS) and transmission near-infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS). To quantify the amount of trace amorphous solids contained in the API of a formulation, calibration curves of tablets containing 40% or 3% solifenacin succinate (SLFS) in the pharmaceutical formulations were prepared. The tablets varied in the ratio of amorphous solids in the API. TRS and NIRS were carried out with the calibration tablets and partial least square regression (PLSR) analysis was performed. Good results were obtained by both TRS and NIRS with the calibration model containing 40% SLFS. On the contrary, with the calibration model containing 3% SLFS, the PLSR analysis results using the TRS data were better than those using the NIRS data. The low content calibration model based on TRS showed good results with R-2 of 0.999, RMSECV of 1.236, and LOD of 0.12. TRS can be used to specifically detect trace amorphous solids contained in the API of a formulation.

AB beta-Cyclodextrin-based nanosponges (beta-CDNSs) play an important role in new arrays of agriculture, floriculture, cosmetics, medicine, high molecular weight proteins, novel flame retardants, gas carriers and water filters. In recent years, the field of advance nanostructured systems witnesses a rapid development due to miniaturization, dose-reduction, sustained and controlled release of actives and long-term stability of material. beta-CDNSs are colloidal and cross-linked nanocarrier comprising of solid mesh-like structure with nano-cavities for encapsulation of complex lipophilic and hydrophilic chemical substances. The release of enthalpy-rich water molecules from the polymeric structures accounts for high complexation efficiency with different molecular substrates. This review primarily focuses on the important characteristics of beta-CDNS, methods of preparation, release kinetics of chemical entity, potential applications and commercial products. The advantages of beta-CDNS involve sustained and controlled release of entrapped molecules with high efficiency and excellent stability. Thus, nanosponges are effective carrier for the delivery of actives and developed as a commercial drug delivery system in pharmaceutical industries after certified clinical studies. In the near future, beta-CDNS-based product will capture the market due to its diverse applications in anti-cancer, antiviral, antiplatelet, antihypertensive therapy, etc.

AB In two recent Phase III clinical trials, use of a 25 mg dapivirine vaginal ring significantly reduced HIV acquisition rates. Post hoc analysis from one of the trials indicated higher rates of protection among women over the age of 21 years when compared to younger women, most likely due to reduced adherence in the latter group. There is currently no information available on how release of dapivirine from the ring is affected by either its intermittent removal from the vagina or women's cleaning of the ring before re-insertion. Here, in vitro drug stability and product performance characteristics of the dapivirine ring were assessed under simulated conditions of real-world use. The impact of systematic deviations from the 28-day continuous use protocol upon in vitro release performance, was investigated. Also, the effect of ring exposure to a range of common household chemicals including bath salts, bleach, detergent and personal lubricants - was examined through measurement of dapivirine content and stability. Dapivirine in vitro release under intermittent schedules was similar to that obtained under the normal continuous schedule ignoring the periods of interruption. Ring exposure to various household chemicals had no discernible impact on dapivirine assay value, degradation or stability.

AB In the current study, the ability to use in-line NIR inside the feed frame of a tablet press to monitor the residence time distribution inside the tablet press was investigated. Pulse-response experiments were performed. In-line measurements inside the feed frame were compared to measurements on the actual produced tablets and the influence of different tableting parameters on the concentration profiles were studied. Turret speed had a major influence on the concentration profiles and RTD parameters. The in-line and off-line concentration profiles did not align with each other as spiking material was still detected in the tablets when no spiking material was observed in the powder blend by the in-line measuring method. The cause of this mismatch between the in-line and off-line curves was the in-line measuring position. By adjusting the position of the NIR probe to the bottom of the feed frame instead of at the top of the feed frame, a perfect alignment between in-line and off-line concentration curves was acquired. In-line measurements at the bottom of the feed frame could, if optimisation to avoid probe fouling is possible, be ideal for real-time measurement and control of the blend concentration during tableting. When probe fouling cannot be avoided, the correlation between the in-line measured concentration at the top of the feed frame and the concentration of the produced tablets should be investigated and modelled to enable real-time measurement and control based on in-line measurements.

AB This study assesses the feasibility of printing implantable devices using 3D printing Fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology. The influence of the deposition temperature, the deposition rate and the layer thickness on the printing process and the physical properties of the devices were evaluated. The filaments were composed of neat poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and blends of different plasticizers (polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400), triacetine (TA), acetyltriethyl citrate (ATEC) and triethyl citrate (TEC)) at 10% (w/w). The assessment of thermo-mechanical characteristics and morphology of both filaments and devices (cylinders and dog bones) were performed. The influence of each parameter was evaluated using a design of experiment (DoE) and the significance of the results was discussed. A large amount of data about the evaluation of FDM process parameters are already available in the literature. However, specific insights needed to be increased into the impact of the use of PLA and plasticized PLA raw material on the feasibility of printing devices in three dimensions. To conclude, the ductility was improved with a high layer thickness, low temperature and using ATEC. Whereas, adhesion was promoted with an increase in temperature, a lower layer thickness and adding TA.

AB Medicine is a natural companion of mankind in the present era for mere survival from the deadly diseases in ever-increasing polluted environments. Hence, in recent years, major focus of pharmaceutical, medicinal and biophysical research has been navigated in exploring and developing new and simple avenues to enhance the efficacy of the administered drugs on one hand and to get rid of, or at least reduce, the toxic side effects of the excess drugs accumulated in human body on the other. A potential approach to amplify the efficacy of the administered drug is to develop proficient targeted drug delivery systems (DDSs). This review provides an essence of some newly developed simple but prospective strategies on enhancing the efficacy of drugs/bioactive molecules exploiting various drug delivery systems like micelles, cyclodextrins, liposomes etc. to serve the purpose of targeted delivery towards DNA, by endogenous and/or exogenous means. Improved bio-availability and solubilization of ionic drugs within the less polar target regions from the bulk aqueous phase has also been achieved through the introduction of some physiologically permissible salts. In the other context, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate a simple technique for easy removal of the excess adsorbed drug molecules from the cell membranes/lipid bilayers by exploiting health-amiable supramolecular assemblies.
   In this review, we summarize the recent experimental findings, mostly from our lab, encompassing the development of simple biocompatible methods to enhance the benevolent role of drugs through their safe, effective and convenient administration. It also presents easy and effective means to remove the excess adsorbed drugs from human body to diminish their malign effects. These prospective approaches of drug delivery and excretion of drug molecules have promising roles to play from both physicochemical and pharmaceutical perspectives, ensuring enhanced bioavailability of drugs as well as disposing of drug-induced adverse side effects.

AB Safe and efficient delivery of microRNA (miRNA) molecules is essential for their successful transition from research to the clinic setting. In the present study, we have used a bile acid, deoxycholic acid (DA), to modify 1.8 kDa branched polyethylenimine (bPEI(1.8)) and subsequently investigated gene delivery features of the resultant conjugates (PEI-DA(n)). We found significant differences between the PEI-DA(n) conjugates and conventional bPEIs with respect to miRNA condensation ability, buffering capacity, cellular uptake, and intracellular gene release behavior in endothelial cells (ECs) isolated from human umbilical vein (HUVECs). Changes in the conjugation degree greatly influenced the transfection performance of the PEI-DA(n) conjugates with respect to miRNA condensation and decondensation properties as well as cellular uptake behavior. The PEI-DA(3) conjugates could significantly enhance the expression level of miRNA-210 in HUVECs. The overexpressed miRNA-210, in turn, markedly downregulated the expression levels of Efna3 and Ptp1b as well as led to a substantial rise in HUVECs' migration rate in a wound healing assay. Collectively, our results have demonstrated that PEI-DA(3) conjugates facilitate the formation of stable nanocomplexes that are loose enough to release miRNAs into the cytosol. The free bioavailable miRNAs, in turn, result in efficient gene silencing comparable to bPEI(25) as well as Lipofectamine RNAiMAX.

AB Peptides are rarely orally administrated due to rapid degradation in the gastrointestinal tract and low absorption at the epithelial border. The objective of this study was to encapsulate a model water-soluble peptide in biodegradable and biocompatible solid lipid-based nanoparticles, i.e. Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLN) and Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLC) in order to protect it from metabolic degradation. Leuprolide (LEU) and a LEU-docusate Hydrophobic Ion Pair (HIP) were encapsulated in SLN and NLC by High Pressure Homogenization. The particles were characterized regarding their Encapsulation Efficiency (EE), size, morphology, peptide release in FaSSIF-V2, and protective effect towards proteases. Nanoparticles of 120 nm with platelet structures were obtained. Formation of HIP led to a significant increase in LEU EE. Particle size was moderately affected by the presence of simulated fluids. Nonetheless, an important burst release was observed upon dispersion in FaSSIF-V2. NLC were able to improve LEU-HIP resistance to enzymatic degradation induced by trypsin but presented no advantages in presence of alpha-chymotrypsin. SLN provided no protection regarding both proteases. Despite an increased amount of encapsulated peptide in solid lipid-based nanoparticles following HIP formation, the important specific surface area linked to their platelet structures resulted in an important peptide release upon dispersion in FaSSIF-V2 and limited protection towards enzymatic degradation.

AB This study describes how near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy can be used to predict the dissolution of bilayer tablets as a non-destructive approach. Tablets in this study consist of two active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) physically separated in layers and manufactured under three levels of hardness. NIR spectra were individually acquired for both layers in diffuse reflectance mode. Reference dissolution profile values were obtained using dissolution apparatus & HPLC. A multivariate partial least squares (PLS) calibration model was developed for each API relating its dissolution profile to spectral data. This calibration model was used to predict dissolution profiles of an independent test set and results of the prediction were compared using model free approaches i.e. dissimilarity (f(1)) & similarity (f(2)) factors to assure similarity in dissolution performance.

AB Oral activity has been described for cyclotide-containing traditional medicines, and demonstrated for reengineered cyclotides bearing grafted therapeutic epitopes, highlighting their potential for translation to the clinic. Here we report preclinical pharmacokinetic parameters for the prototypic cyclotide kalata B1 (kB1) and two orally active grafted analogues, ckb-KAL and ckb-KIN, to provide the first in vivo dose-exposure metrics for cyclotides. Native and grafted kB1 molecules exhibited multiple compartment kinetics and measurable but limited oral bioavailability of similar magnitude to several orally administered peptide drugs in the clinic. Cyclotides are mostly associated with the central compartment, and display small (0.07-0.13 L kg(-1) for kB1 and ckb-KIN) to moderate (1 L kg(-1) for ckb-KAL) steady state volumes of distribution. This study provides new data essential to the evaluation of cyclotides as therapeutics, validating them as a viable drug design scaffold with tunable pharmacokinetic properties.

AB Identifying the critical process parameters (CPPs) of a complex drug product manufacture and the associated impact on critical quality attributes (CQAs) is essential to the development and quality control of both new and generic drugs. AmBisome, a liposomal amphotericin B (AMB) macrolide antibiotic widely adopted as an important antifungal drug product, was used as a model complex drug product in the current study. This study investigated how multi-step production approaches and related manufacturing conditions may affect essential physico-chemical and toxicological properties of the final drug product. A key challenge in the manufacture and analysis of liposomal AMB was the drug substance's propensity to aggregate, with associated poor solubility in water and organic solvents. This study identified three key CPPs in a four step manufacturing process: (i) proper acidification during formation of the drug-lipid complexes (Step 1), (ii) liposome heat curing following liposomal particle sizing (Step 3), and (iii) flash-freezing at the initial stages of the lyophilization cycle (Step 4). Over-acidification led to rapid degradation of the drug, whereas under-acidification hampered full solubilization and formation of the soluble drug-lipid complexes. Extended heat treatment of the formed liposomes at 65 degrees C, just above the lipid phase transition temperature, brought dramatic changes in the aggregated state and/or packing of the drug in the liposomal bilayer, as followed by the complex changes in the UV/Vis spectra. Such thermal conditioning resulted in a five- to ten-fold reduction in the in-vitro toxicity of the drug product, bringing it close to the values for AmBisome used as control and measured by the RBC assay. Finally, flash-freezing conditions during lyophilization was critical to prevent aggregation and maintaining the 80-120 nm liposome size when reconstituted. Our research found that changes in the amphotericin's UV/Vis spectra were a sensitive CQA measure and provided a set of quantitative parameters for a facile non-destructive process monitoring in-situ, as well as for comparison of the quality of final formulations.

AB The majority of NCEs are weakly basic drugs. Consequently, their solubility is highly pH-dependent, with higher solubility in the acidic stomach and poor solubility in the neutral intestinal environment. The gastric emptying of dissolved drug can lead to the intestinal precipitation of the drug. One option of reducing this process is to formulate the drug together with a precipitation inhibitor (PI). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different PIs on the intestinal concentrations of ketoconazole and five orally administered kinase inhibitors (i.e. pazopanib, gefitinib, lapatinib, vemurafenib, and a Merck KGaA research compound, MSC-A) with the aid of a predictive small-scale in vitro transfer model. This screening revealed that HPMCAS and Soluplus (R) were the most effective PIs. Whereas all other drugs precipitated within several minutes, gefitinib expressed highly variable amorphous precipitation which was confirmed by PXRD. During the transfer model experiments, this intermediate supersaturated state was stabilized using HPMCAS and Soluplus (R). The PI screening protocol described herein allows to study the effect of PIs for solubility and potential bioavailability improvement of poorly soluble drugs to support formulation development already in early stages.

AB The synergistic effectiveness of chitosan with zinc oxide nanomicelles (CZNPs) on broad spectrum of multidrug resistance (MDR) was previously evidenced in our labs, requiring elucidation of the therapeutic index (TI) for safe in vivo use. This in vitro assessment estimated the effective dose (ED50) of micellar CZNPs for eradication of the MDR Enterococcus faecium 1449 model and the corresponding cytotoxic dose (LD50) against rat small intestinal epithelial cells as functions of TI. In order to visually determine the mechanistic effects of micellar CZNPs on bacterial biofilm size reduction, LIVE/DEAD viability assay was used in conjunction with advanced fluorescence imaging and 3D confocal microscopy. Biofilm quantification was performed through the measure of the fluorescence intensity, using the Biotek Synergy Neo2 for calculating the ED50. To generate the LD50, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cytotoxicity assay was implemented. Quantification results revealed, at the same concentration (200 mu g/mL), micellar CZNPs had average biofilm reduction of approximately 50.22% at 24 h (ED50, = 199.13 mu g/mL, LD50 = 240.20 mu g/mL, TI = 1.2062), compared to chitosan (15.66%) and ZnO (13.94%) alone. Conclusively, the ED (50)) of micellar CZNPs on MDR bacterial biofilms (199.13 mu g/mL) as a function of TI reveals a promising nanotherapeutic agent in comparison to either Chitosan or ZnO alone.

AB The modulation of blood flow to tumors is a prominent strategy for improving the tumor accumulation of nanomedicines, resulting from the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. We previously reported a promising EPR enhancer-a nitric oxide (NO) donor-containing liposome (NO-LP)-which showed enhanced accumulation in tumor tissue. Herein, we study NO-LP in greater detail to clarify its practical use as an EPR enhancer. NO-LP was found to have advantages as a NO donor, including the ability to maintain NO donation over long periods of time, and a constant rate of NO-release irrespective of the environmental pH. NO-LP showed rapid accumulation in tumor tissue after injection (1 h), and then accumulation was continuously enhanced until 48 h. Enhanced NO-LP accumulation was observed specifically in tumor, while the accumulation in other organs remained relatively unchanged. The results obtained show the promising features of NO-LP as an EPR enhancer.

AB Catechin hydrate is a phytopharmaceutical with promising anticancer effects but poor bioavailability. This study aimed to elaborate catechin loaded chitosan-tethered liposomes (chitosomes) to enhance catechin oral bioavailability. Nanocarriers were optimized via ethanol injection method followed by physicochemical, ex vivo and biological appraisal in male Wistar albino rats. Results demonstrated that chitosomes possessed excellent nanosize of 137 nm, monodispersity (PDI < 0.2) and high Zeta potential of + 36.8 mV. Additionally, chitosomes showed significant improvement in digestive stability against bile salt with enhanced ex-vivo intestinal permeation. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed the significant potential of chitosomes to enhance catechin bioavailability (AUC, Cmax) and sustain its effect (Tmax). In conclusion, elaborated chitosomes are promising nanoplatforms to enhance catechin oral efficacy with lower dose, side effects, administration frequency and higher patient compliance.

AB Corneal infections are treated by multiple instillations of eye drops each day. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of ofloxacin-loaded contact lenses as prolonged release devices for the treatment of bacterial keratitis.
   Two silicone hydrogel contact lenses (SHCLs) Senofilcon A (ACUVUE OASYS (R)) and Narafilcon A (ACUVUE TRUEYE (R)) were modified by incorporation of ofloxacin alone or with vitamin E (VE). The drug uptake and in vitro release kinetics were investigated and the antibacterial efficacy was assessed against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in an ex vivo rabbit corneal model.
   The in vitro studies showed a higher uptake (p <= 0.05) and longer duration of release by Narafilcon A lenses compared to the Senofilcon A lenses. The addition of VE led to a significant increase in duration of release (p < 0.05) for both lenses. The ex vivo studies confirmed the effectiveness of the ofloxacin-loaded lenses in the reduction of bacterial load to clinically insignificant levels and ofloxacin-vitamin E-loaded Narafilcon A lenses in the reduction of bacteria on the corneas to undetectable levels.
   Antibiotic-loaded lenses are effective in the treatment of ocular infections. Incorporation of vitamin E will sustain this effect and eliminate the need for multiple instillations of eye drops.

AB The biological barriers in the body have been fabricated by nature to protect the body from foreign molecules. The successful delivery of drugs is limited and being challenged by these biological barriers including the gastrointestinal tract, brain, skin, lungs, nose, mouth mucosa, and immune system. In this review article, we envisage to understand the functionalities of these barriers and revealing various drug-loaded biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles to overcome these barriers and deliver the entrapped drugs to cancer targeted site. Apart from it, tissue-specific multifunctional ligands, linkers and transporters when employed imparts an effective active delivery strategy by receptor-mediated transcytosis. Together, these strategies enable to deliver various drugs across the biological membranes for the treatment of solid tumors and malignant cancer.

AB The feed frame system is one of the key elements of a rotary tablet press. The powder in the funnel flows through the feed frame system, which ensures a uniform powder flow to the die disc. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of different feed frame designs of a production-scale rotary tablet press on the residence time distribution of two microcrystalline cellulose blends, one of them serving as a tracer blend and the other serving as a filling material. With these powder blends, the effect of a reduction of the filling volume of a three chamber feed frame on the powder residence time was investigated. It was shown, that the volume reduction of the three chamber feed frame equipped with three modified large hub wheels led to a decrease of the powder residence time as well as to low intermixing of the powder particles. Furthermore, the residence time distribution within the three chamber feed frame was compared to that within a single chamber cone-shaped feed frame. Both feed frame designs had a similar filling volume but different powder paths through the respective feed frame chambers. The results showed that the single chamber feed frame led to a narrower distribution of the powder residence time and a lower intermixing than the three chamber feed frame. An interesting output of the study was that the variation of the feed frame design had a more pronounced effect on the powder behavior than the variation of the filling volume.

AB In this study we examined the potential of novel biodegradable polymers of polyesterurethane (PU), and its PEGylated (PU-PEG) form as nanocarriers of Infliximab (INF), to treat inflammation in an in-vitro epithelial model. Nanoparticles (NPs) formulated were of average size of 200-287 nm. INF loading of NPs (INF-NPs) resulted in an increase in size and zeta potential. No cytotoxicity was observed for any of the NPs. Cellular interaction and uptake of PU NPs were similar compared with polycaprolactone (PCL) NPs and significantly higher to Poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) NPs. Cellular interaction was higher for corresponding PEG-NPs. INF-PU and INF-PU-PEG NPs showed a rapid rate and extent of recovery of the epithelial barrier function in inflamed Caco-2 cell monolayers and decreased cytokine levels in inflamed monocytes. Results obtained in this study are promising and the potential of PU and PU-PEG NPs for drug delivery and targeting to treat gastrointestinal inflammation warrants further investigation.

AB Biocompatible polymers and ceramic materials have been identified as vital components to fabricate drug delivery and tissue engineering applications because of their high drug loading capability, sustained release and higher mechanical strength with remarkable in-vivo bioavailability. In the present work, initially we designed kappa-carrageenan grafted with maleic anhydride and then reacted it with isoniazid drug (kappa-Car-MA-INH). The polymeric system was cross linked with nanohydroxyapatite (NHAP) via electrostatic interaction followed by the addition of rifampicin (RF) and loaded to fabricate kappa-Car-MA-INH/NHAP/RF nanocomposites. The chemical modification and interaction of drug with the polymeric-ceramic system were characterised by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The zeta potential of the kappa-Car-MA-INH/NHAP/RF nanocomposite was observed to be - 20.04 mV using Zetasizer. The in vitro drug release studies demonstrated that the nanocomposite releases 76% of RF and 82% of INH in 12 days at pH 5.5. Scanning Electron Microscope analysis revealed the structural deformation of Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae upon treatment with this nanocomposite. By using ex-vivo studies combined with physio-chemical characterization methods on the erythrocytes, L929 and MG-63 cell lines, this composite was found to be biocompatible, non-cytotoxic and inducing cell proliferation with less significant hemolysis. Thus, our modified drug delivery nanocomposites afforded higher drug bioavailability with large potential for fabrication as long-acing drug delivery nanocomposites, especially with hydrophobic drugs inducing the growth of osteoblastic bone cells.

AB Franz cell (FC) experiments in topical and transdermal drug development represent the gold standard in vitro method but require a relatively high quantity of human skin, are low-throughput, and are time-consuming to perform. To address these issues, we studied a micro-well plate-based screening method for permeability and retention that could enable the direct screening of large numbers of formulations simultaneously across human skin. Using freshly excised dermatomed human skin modified to reflect poor barrier function and a model hydrophilic compound, Sulforhodamine B (SRB), FC permeation and retention quantification was compared to the 96-well high-throughput system (HTS). The skin was analyzed using 2-photon microscopy to determine the drug distribution within the skin. A screen of 15 different formulations in triplicate in a single piece of human skin, using full factorial design was then conducted. Permeability of SRB across the skin as well as the drug distribution profile of SRB retained in the skin were similar for the FC and HTS system. The influence of different excipients on drug retention was observed in the full factorial formulation screen. The HTS method is promising for the investigation of large numbers of formulations and the influence of formulations changes in skin retention of drug.

AB Solvent-free hot melt coating (HMC) provides a safer and more economic process compared to the conventional solvent coating techniques. However, drug release instability and the lack of fundamental understanding on it are limiting factors for application of HMC for industrial productions. In this work, we investigated glyceryl dibehenate, glyceryl monostearate and behenoyl polyoxyl-8 glyceride as HMC materials. The microstructure and solid state alteration of lipids were studied via polarized light microscopy, DSC and powder x-ray diffraction. Microcapsules of N-acetylcysteine particles were provided with these excipients and stored under long term and accelerated conditions for 3 months. The feasibility of selected lipids as HMC excipients was confirmed. The drug release from freshly coated microcapsules was dictated by microstructure, solid state and HLB of lipid coating. Alterations in the release profiles after storage under accelerated conditions were correlated with time-dependent structural alterations of selected lipids. The faster drug release from glyceryl dibehenate and behenoyl polyoxyl-8 glyceride microcapsules was correlated with a low-melting small fraction composed by mixed phases in glyceryl dibehenate and the amorphous region of polyoxyl part in behenoyl polyoxyl-8 glyceride, respectively. The slower drug release from glyceryl dibehenate after storage was explained by the transition of lipid crystals to the beta-form with dense crystalline structure. The gained information can be used to design effective tempering strategies for providing stable pharmaceutical products.

AB A newly synthesized polystyrene-g-polyoleic acid-g-polyethylene glycol graft copolymer (PoleS-PEG) was used as adsorbent in the solid phase microextraction of selenium ions by using electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). Neodymium magnet was used for separation of analyte ions. Various analytical parameters such as pH, adsorbent amount, mixing time, eluent solution, sample volume, etc. were optimized. The matrix effects of some cations and anions were also studied. The capacity of the adsorbent was found 11.5 mg g(-1). The preconcentration factor was found to be 50. The detection limit (LOD) and quantification limit (LOQ) were found 6.06 ng L-1 and 20 ng L-1, respectively. The calibration curve was linear in the range of 0.02-4.0 mu g L-1. Relative standard deviation was found 3.2%. The accuracy of the method was provided by using standard reference materials. The optimized method was successfully applied to natural water and food samples.

AB Effects of salicylic acid (SA), chitosan and combinative SA and chitosan (SA+ Chitosan) preharvest-treatments on bioactive compounds improvement of daikon sprouts during cold storage (5 +/- 1 degrees C) were investigated. In preliminary experiment, 2.0mM SA and 0.1% chitosan treatments were best concentration in improving antioxidant activity and bioactive compounds of the sprouts during storage. In the main experiment, the effects of SA+ Chitosan treatment on visual appearance, antioxidant activity, phytochemicals and antioxidant enzymes of the sprouts were monitored during storage. Visual appearance and pigments contents did not significantly change throughout storage. SA+ Chitosan treated sprouts contained total phenols, ascorbic acid, antioxidant enzymes and antioxidant activity higher that control. Compared to SA and chitosan, SA + Chitosan enhanced total phenols, ascorbic acid, catalase activity and free radical scavenging activity during storage. In conclusion, SA + Chitosan could be a good mean enhancing phytochemicals of daikon sprouts during cold storage.

AB In the proposed work an ultrasound assisted ion pair based surfactant-enhanced dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (UA-IPSE-DLLME) with solidification of floating organic drop was studied for preconcentration and flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) determination of nickel and cobalt ions in vegetable and herb samples. Congo Red (CR) and didecyldimethyl ammonium chloride (DDMAC) were used as complexing and ionpairing agents, respectively. By using ion-pairing agent CR-metal complexes gained more hydrophobic character and extracted into 1-dodecanol more efficiently. Some parameters affect extraction efficiency were studied and some analytical characteristics of the method were calculated. Under optimized conditions, detection limit of 1.7 mu g L-1 and 2.4 mu g L-1, quantification limit of 5.6 mu g L-1 and 7.9 mu g L-1 and enrichment factors of 65 and 48 were obtained for nickel and cobalt, respectively. Relative standard deviation (n= 7) for 100 mu g L-1 nickel and cobalt were 3.6% and 3.8%, respectively. The proposed UA-IPSE-DLLME method has been successfully applied for the determination of nickel and cobalt ions in certified reference materials and some food samples.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of enriching a complex food matrix (FM) with grape extracts on polyphenol content, composition, bioaccessibility and antioxidant activity during digestion. The grape extracts and FM were separately tested under the same conditions as controls. The FM by itself contains a significant amount of phenolic acids and flavonols, influencing the final recovery of polyphenols from grape extracts. The FM significantly increased the total recovery of polyphenols after digestion of grape seed extracts compared to those digested without the FM; however, a low recovery of proantocyanidins and total flavonoids was observed. Digestive fluids and FM compounds significantly increased the total polyphenol content of grape digests and significantly contributed to their ABTS(center dot+) scavenging activity and ferrous-ion-chelating capacity. The present study suggested that enrichment of meat-and cereal-based products with grape polyphenol extracts could be a good strategy to formulate a healthier diet.

AB Microwave (MW) heating improved the activity of transglutaminase (TGase) by inducing conformational changes due to structural modification. However, when TGase and myofibrillar protein were heated, the solubility and degree of crosslinking were similar. Further, the gel properties of the mixed solution pre-gelled by MW heating were lower than that obtained with water bath (WB) pre-gelling. We compared the effects on myofibrillar proteins at the same heating rate, our results showed that MW promoted aggregation, as the particle distribution tended toward larger molecular size. The increase of random coil as investigated by circular dichroism (CD) indicated that WB induced the unfolding of myofibrillar protein. MW enhanced intermolecular forces by engendering more disulfide bonds, which hindered the catalysis by TGase. Finally, SDS-PAGE indicated that the myosin molecules had more head crosslinking during MW treatment. MW and WB cause different response behaviors of myofibrillar protein, thereby affecting the catalytic effect of TGase.

AB In this study, the gelatinization behavior of wheat starch was investigated using starch-water mixtures that were heated under different conditions. Heating starch-water mixtures at 50 degrees C, a temperature below onset temperature (To) of starch gelatinization, resulted in disruption of long-and short-range ordered structure, as measured by differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction and laser confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy, and the extent of disruption was greater when starch was heated at higher water content. At low water content (23-44%), heating duration had little effect on gelatinization behavior of starch, whereas at higher water content (54-75%), longer duration of heating resulted in greater disruption of multiscale structure of starch. From this study, we concluded that the gelatinization endotherm of starch does not represent the complete gelatinization behavior, and starch gelatinization initiates earlier than To. Longer duration of heating caused a greater disruption of starch structure at high water content than at low water content.

AB In the dairy industry, substitution of high priced milk species with low priced ones is a common practice, and determination of milk species is critical. In this study, synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS) method was developed for identification of milk species in fermented dairy products (yoghurt and cheese). Three partial least square-discriminant analysis models were developed in order to identify pure-mixed samples, milk species and binary mixture type, and partial least square (PLS) model was utilized to quantify the mixing ratio in binary mixtures. PLS models used for yoghurt and cheese samples showed that detection limits of adulteration were below 3.3%. Apart from the buffalo-cow yoghurt and goat-cow cheese, precision of the measurements was found to be below 6.2. It can be said that SFS technique is applicable on yoghurt and cheese samples as it's a less destructive and a less costly method compared to DNA and protein based conventional methods.

AB The interaction between wheat starch and Mesona chinensis polysaccharide (MCP) was found to change the molecular mobility of the water and carbohydrate populations in starch-MCP gels, when measured using proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation methods. The starch and MCP mobilities appeared similar at a micron scale. However, at a distance of less than 5 nm could they be detected as having separate mobility states, indicating close interaction between the starch and MCP. The carbon-6 of the starch glucan monomer was observed to have the largest mobility change in the presence of MCP. Two mobility populations of carbon-6 were observed, possibly corresponding to the carbon-6 in the linear chains of both amylose and amylopectin, and another to the carbon-6 involved in the branching of amylopectin. The change in the mobility of one of the carbon-6 populations indicates an increase in molecular freedom of movement in the presence of MCP.

AB The dissipation kinetics of a combined use of procymidone and thiamethoxam, and their impact on the biodiversity and pathogen on surface of tomatoes were studied. The half-lives of procymidone and thiamethoxam, used either on their own or in combination with each other, were 2.94 or 3.26 days and 2.41 or 2.67 days, respectively. The residues dropped below the maximum residue limit (MRL) after 7 or 10 days (MRL 2 mg.kg(-1) for procymidone), and 10 or 14 days (MRL 0.2 mg.kg(-1) for thiamethoxam), respectively. The phylum Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, and Proteobacteria, were dominantly present in all studied samples. The genus Escherichia-Shigella was found and exposed to the dissipation of procymidone (r=-0.9209 for procymidone on its own, and r=-0.8611 for procymidone in combination with thiamethoxam). These results will contribute to establish adequate monitoring of pesticides residues and their incorporation in surface ecology and pathogen management strategies in tomatoes.

AB In this study, alcalase and neutrase were used in combination to prepare collagen peptides with high calcium binding ability. The optimal conditions for the preparation of peptide-calcium chelate (mass ratio of peptide/calcium of 4.5:1 for 40 min at 50 degrees C and pH 9) were determined by response surface methodology (RSM), under which a calcium chelating rate of 78.38% was obtained. The results of Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis), fluorescence and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra synthetically indicated that calcium could be chelated by carboxyl oxygen and amino nitrogen atoms of collagen peptides, thus forming peptide-calcium chelate. The chelate was stable at various temperatures and pH values, and exhibited excellent stability in the gastrointestinal environment, which could promote calcium absorption in human gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, Caco-2 cell monolayer model was used to investigate the effect of peptide-calcium chelate on promoting calcium absorption. Results showed that peptide-calcium chelate could significantly improve calcium transport in Caco-2 cell monolayer and reverse the inhibition of calcium absorption by phosphate and phytate. The findings provide a scientific basis for developing new calcium supplements and the high-value utilization of pig bone.

AB Polyphenols are hot research topics worldwide owing to their physiological and pharmaceutical activities. Polyphenols and polyphenol-enriched by-products have been widely used in bakery foods because of their neutraceutical properties. This review summarizes the classification, biosynthesis, main source and analysis of polyphenols and intensively discusses the effects of their incorporation in baked foods. The positive effects of polyphenol incorporation include elevation of antioxidant activity of baked foods, scavenging of food-borne toxins produced during thermal processing and decreasing postprandial serum glucose level. Meanwhile, polyphenol incorporation negatively influences colour, texture and flavour of baked foods and bioavailability of the added polyphenols. Most polyphenols are thermally sensitive and reactive. Thus far, few studies have investigated on neoformed compounds from the reaction of polyphenols or their oxidised products (quinones) with other food components. Before launching polyphenol-incorporated bakery foods in the market, future work should focus on full toxicological evaluation of newly derived compounds from polyphenols.

AB Key odorants of Guojing sesame-flavor Baijiu were identified using the concept of molecular sensory science, including aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) based on gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 509 volatile compounds were detected by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOF-MS). Sixty-one aroma-active compounds were identified via AEDA. Among them, two compounds with strong roasted aroma showed the highest flavor dilution (FD) factors of 19,683 and 6561. By using pure standards, aroma tests, and GC-MS, the compound with FD = 19683 was identified as benzenemethanethiol, which is reported for the first time in Baijiu. Sixty compounds were quantified by means of internal standard curve method, and 39 of them had odor activity values (OAVs) >= 1. Ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, and dimethyl trisulfide showed the highest OAVs, indicating that they contribute significantly to the aroma of Guojing sesame-flavor Baijiu.

AB The current study reports data on antioxidant, antimicrobial and neutrophil-modulating activities of different polyphenolic preparations from black chokeberry fruits: crude extract, purified extract standardized to 20% and 40% anthocyanins, and proanthocyanidins; as well as pure compounds (chlorogenic acid, cyanidin-3-O-galactoside, epicatechin, rutin and quercetin) present in black chokeberries. Minor phenolic components - quercetin and epicatechin showed the highest ORAC and TRAP antioxidant activity. Given the amount of individual phenolics in the fruits, proanthocyanidins are the major contributor to antioxidant activity of fresh black chokeberries. Studied polyphenols and preparations had no effect on the spontaneous chemiluminescence (CL) of human neutrophils and only mild effect on PMA-activated CL. Greater effects were observed on OZP-activated CL, being statistically significant (p < 0.05) for quercetin and rutin. The antimicrobial activity test against 10 pathogens showed that black chokeberry proanthocyanidins are the most potent antimicrobial agents in the fruit.

AB This study aimed to investigate the effect of purple yam (Dioscorea alata L.) flour substitution for wheat flour on in vitro starch digestibility of wheat bread. The enzyme-resistant starch content increased from 34.9% for wheat flour bread to 41.3% for bread made with 70% wheat flour and 30% purple yam flour. Meanwhile, the content of rapidly digestible starch and slowly digestible starch decreased with the addition of purple yam flour in the bread. The results from differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, polarized light and scanning electron microscopy showed that purple yam starch granules were not completely disrupted during bread baking. The fluorescence intensity of alpha-amylase and amyloglucosidase was reduced in bread made with purple yam flour. The decreased digestibility of starch in bread made with purple yam flour was due to the relatively intact starch granules from purple yam flour and possibly an inhibitory effect on digestive enzymes by purple yam flour.

AB To examine the effect of sugar reduction on the sensory perception of sweetened beverages, an orange juice soft drink model flavoured with seven characteristic compounds (hexanal, decanal, linalool, ethyl butanoate, alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol) was developed. Five samples were prepared with relevant sugar contents (5.2, 8.2, 9.7, 11.2 and 14.2 degrees Brix). Using retronasal quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA), nine attributes were found to differ significantly (p < 0.05) with sugar content. When the samples were evaluated orthonasally, only the attribute "overripe orange" significantly decreased (p < 0.05) with reduction of sugar content. Headspace solid-phase microextraction with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed that as sugar concentration decreased, the headspace concentration of six of the volatile compounds decreased, whilst ethyl butanoate remained constant. Principal component analysis revealed that the total release of the flavour compounds was highly correlated with the perceived intensity of the orthonasal attribute "overripe orange".

AB Tiger nut milk is a nutrient rich drink with great commercialization potential. However, it is highly perishable. Microencapsulation of tiger nut milk by a blend of inulin and modified tiger nut starch resulted in a product with good characteristics. The microspheres of lyophilized tiger nut milk were spherical with and average particle size of 1.01 mu m. It's thermal degradation occurred above 346 degrees C, denoting an excellent thermal resistance. There was no significant structural alteration in the active material after microencapsulation and no loss of stability within 60 days, which confirms that this process enables the preservation of freshness and chemical characteristics of tiger nut milk. During 30-90 days, vitamin C contents were stable in the presence or absence of light. Microsphere with tiger nut milk presented a shelf life of 60 days. Total aerobic mesophiles and total fungi counts were below 10(6) CFU/mL, showing good microbiological stability.

AB A low falling number (FN) in wheat indicates high alpha-amylase activity associated with poor end-use quality. We hypothesize starch - the substrate of alpha-amylase, can directly influence hot flour pasting properties and its susceptibility to alpha-amylase, which further affects viscosity. We examined the structural characteristics of starch in three soft white spring wheat cultivars grown in Idaho in 2013 (normal FN year) and 2014 (low FN year with pre-harvest rains). Our data surprisingly show that starch in some low FN wheat was not significantly degraded by alpha-amylase but had developmental changes with an increased proportion of B-type wheat starch. We reconstituted wheat starch and verified that starch with an increase of B-granules has a relatively low viscosity and high susceptibility to wheat alpha-amylase, which further facilitates the decrease of viscosity. The influence of starch structure and starch-enzyme interaction must be considered while developing a solution to the low FN issue.

AB A study was undertaken to quantify the concentration of toxic and potentially toxic elements in samples of rice, rice crackers, rice noodles, infant cereals and rice vinegar available in the Argentine market. The determination of nine elements, namely, As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, and Zn in 29 samples was performed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Element concentrations spanned the range (ng g(-1)): As, 67-858; Cd, < 0.2-24.0; Cr, 36.6-937; Hg, < 50; Ni, 38.6-1040; Pb, < 2.0-139; Sb, < 3.0-24.7; Se, < 8.4-178 and Zn, 129-32400. Mercury was not detected in any of the analyzed samples. The highest concentration (32.4 mu g g(-1)) was found for Zn in infant cereals that according to the label were added by the manufacturer. To assess accuracy, NIST 1568a rice flour was analyzed and results were in good agreement with certified values.

AB The chemical profiles and aroma contribution of terpene compounds in Meili grapes and wine were analyzed. Bound terpene compounds were extracted using methanol, purified using Amberlite XAD-2 resin, concentrated in methanol/ethyl acetate, and enzymatically hydrolyzed to release aglycones. Free terpene compounds were identified using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Wine aroma characteristics were quantified by a trained sensory panel. Seventeen terpene glycosides were quantified in grapes and wines as pentosyl-glucopyranoside, the content of which ranged from 804 to 836 mu g/kg, and from 155 to 192 mu g/L, respectively. Eight free terpenes were present in wines with their content ranging from 40.1 to 59.7 mu g/L. Linalool was abundant both in bound and free terpenes, and mathematical regression revealed that terpenes, especially linalool (contribution efficient > 0.4), contributed heavily to Meili wine aroma. Finally, a molecular rearrangement scheme based on linalool was proposed in Meili grape and wine.

AB Due to unique phytochemicals contained, Vaccinum berries are known to have a number of positive health effects. In this context, lingonberries (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) are considered to be the most effective, thus finding many uses. Recently, fraud suspicion on lingonberries-based products has been reported, partial or even total replacement by less valued cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon) was found. In this study, metabolomic finger-printing employing instrumental platform consisting of U-HPLC-HRMS/MS was investigated for discrimination between the two Vaccinum berries species. Methanolic extracts of 33 authentic samples from two harvest years were analyzed and chemometric evaluation was performed to identify significant marker compounds, their stability during drying process was assessed, too. The characteristic markers most contributing to berries classification were representatives of polyphenols and phospholipids. Peonidin 3-O-arabinoside and myricetin 3-O-glucoside, not occurring in lingonberries, enabled to discover the presence of cranberries in prepared admixtures down to 1% (w/w).

AB Use of harmful chemicals and expensive maintenance of cold-storage conditions for controlling sprouting are among the major problems in potato storage. Here, 20 essential oils (EOs) were tested for their sprouting-inhibiting and sprouting-inducing activities. Overall, treatments of lemon grass (LG) and clove (CL) oils could induce sprouting whereas palmarosa (PR) and ajwain (AZ) oils could inhibit sprouting of potato tubers at normal-room-temperature (25 +/- 2 degrees C) storage. Selected-EOs treatments affected sprouting by modulation of accumulation of reducing sugars, ethylene, and expression of genes involved in tuber-sprouting such as ARF, ARP, AIP and ERF. Surprisingly, 7-days AZ-treatments could inhibit sprouting for 30-days which was mediated via damaging apical meristem. However, LG-and CL-treated tubers could produce enhanced potato yield as well. Present work clearly demonstrates that selected-EOs can be used as a promising eco-friendly approach for inducing/inhibiting sprouting of potato tubers during potato storage and those enhancing sprouting can be used for enhancing productivity.

Allura red AC, brilliant black PN and direct brown 1 bound to lysozyme through a static quenching mechanism with 10(5) magnitude binding constants. The binding affinity, mainly driven by hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces, follows the order: direct brown 1 > brilliant black PN > allura red AC. Based on structural and computational analysis, the addition of the monoazo/disazo/trisazo dye led to differing degrees of lysozyme unfolding and numbers of azo groups. The type of substituents on the structures has momentous influence on the transportation and distribution of food dyes to egg white lysozyme.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the interaction between packaging parameters (transmission of light and oxygen) and storage temperatures (4, 20, 40 degrees C) on nutrient retention of Spinach (Spinacia oleracea) juice, spray-dried in the absence of an added encapsulant. beta-Carotene was more susceptible to degradation compared with lutein and alpha-tocopherol. Under our experimental conditions, it was observed that excluding low fluorescent light intensity and air by vacuum packaging at 20 degrees C did not seem to improve nutrient retention loss over time (p > 0.05). The rate of beta-carotene, lutein and alpha-tocopherol loss displayed first order reaction kinetic with low activation energy of 0.665, 2.650 and 13.893 kJ/mol for vacuum, and 1.089, 4.923 and 14.142 kJ/mol for non-vacuum, respectively. The reaction kinetics and half-life for beta-carotene, lutein and alpha-tocopherol at 4 degrees C and non-vacuumed were 2.2 x 10(-2), 1.2 x 10(-2), and 0.8 x 10(-2) day(-1), and 32.08, 58.25 and 85.37 day, respectively.

AB A sarcoplasmic serine proteinase (SSP) was purified from threadfin bream (Nemipterus virgatus) belly muscle by ammonium sulfate precipitation and a series of chromatographies including Q-Sepharose, Phenyl Sepharose and Superdex 200. The SSP was purified 1967 folds with a yield of 4.8%. The molecular weight of the SSP was estimated to be 43.5 kDa and 22.5 kDa on SDS-PAGE under non-reducing and reducing conditions, respectively. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the two protein bands were determined as IVGGYEXQPYSQAHQVSLNSGY and corresponded. It is suggested that the SSP exists as a homodimer. Optimum pH and temperature were 9.5 and 50 degrees C, using Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-MCA as a substrate. Substrate specificity and effects of inhibitors indicated that the SSP was a trypsin-like serine proteinase. The SSP was responsible for hydrolyzing myosin heavy chain (MHC) and inducing modori phenomenon in the threadfin bream surimi gel. Thus, the SSP was considered as a modori-inducing proteinase.

AB The mycotoxin citrinin is often produced during fermentation of Monascus products. We studied the effects of flavonoids on citrinin production by Monascus aurantiacus Li AS3.4384 (MALA) by adding rutin, alpha-glucosylrutin, or troxerutin to the fermentation medium, in a first-of-its-kind study. Appropriate amounts of rutin, alpha-glucosylrutin, or troxerutin did not affect normal mycelial growth. Addition of 5.0 g/l of rutin only weakly reduced (29.2%) citrinin production, relative to inhibition by 5 g/l alpha-glucosylrutin or troxerutin (by 54.7% and 40.6%, respectively). In starch inorganic liquid culture media, addition of 20.0 g/l of troxerutin, followed by fermentation for 12 days, reduced citrinin yield by 75.26%. Addition of 15.0 g/l of troxerutin to low-starch peptone liquid fermentation media reduced citrinin yield by 87.9% after 14 days of fermentation, and addition of 30.0 g/l troxerutin to yeast extract sucrose liquid media for 12 days reduced citrinin yield by 53.7%.

AB US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permitted for direct addition of castor oil into food for human consumption and recently FDA approved castor oil as over-the-counter (OTC) for laxative drug. Castor oil (COL) is a vegetable oil and naturally polyol which is inexpensive, environmental friendly and a very valuable renewable resource. Metals are believed to influence antioxidant property of ligands. Metals copper, zinc, cobalt and barium were incorporated with castor oil and subsequently structures were established by FT-IR, UV-Visible, and H-1 NMR spectroscopic techniques. In vitro antioxidant activities of metal containing COL were determined by DPPH and superoxide scavenging methods and the results were compared with vitamin C. Enhanced antioxidant nature of metal containing castor oil was noticed and compared to virgin castor oil. This study reveals that synthesized metal containing-COL is a potential antioxidant material.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the effects of L-lysine (Lys)/L-arginine (Arg)/L-cysteine (Cys) on the color of cured sausage and the possible mechanism underlying these effects. The results indicated that the combined addition of Arg/Lys/Cys and NaNO2 effectively increased the a* values and nitroso pigment content but decreased the MetMb(Fe3+) content in cured sausage, compared with the individual addition of Arg/Lys/Cys and NaNO2. The cured sausage treated with combined Arg/Lys/Cys and NaNO2 contained significantly lower residual nitrite than those treated with only NaNO2. UV-vis spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that pentacoordinate nitrosyl ferrohemochrome was the main pigment component in the cured sausage treated with NaNO2 or combined Arg/Lys/Cys and NaNO2 and higher content in the latter one. The results suggest that Arg/Lys/Cys hindered myoglobin oxidation and promoted pentacoordinate nitrosylmyoglobin formation, which could contribute to the improved color of cured sausage. The results are of interest in the meat industry.

AB High methoxy citrus pectin (UM88) was saponified to produce modified pectin [M(72, 42, and 9)], with different levels of degree of esterification (DE), to investigate the complex coacervation of pea protein isolate (PPI) with pectin [UM88 and M(72, 42, and 9)]. Regardless of the DE value of pectin, the critical pH corresponding to when insoluble complexes form shifted to higher pH as the mixing ratio increased. The maximum amount of coacervates formed at a biopolymer-mixing ratio of 8:1, 8:1, 10:1 and 15:1 for PPI with UM88, M72, M42, and M9, respectively. Maximum interactions for the protein-pectin admixtures occurred between pH 3.70 and 3.85. PPI complexed with modified pectin displayed greater interactions under their optimal mixing conditions compared to the unmodified pectin. The de-esterification of pectin resulted in more rigid and stiffer pectin, which enhanced its interaction with PPI by shifting the critical parameters to a higher value.

AB In light of a recent update in EU regulations governing levels of acrylamide in foodstuffs, further understanding of the role of different precursors is fundamental to extending mitigation strategies into a wider product range. Kinetic modelling was used to investigate the role of maltose in the formation of acrylamide during the finish-frying of french fries. The maltose concentration of raw white potato strips was systematically increased from 0 to 1.4% to observe the effect of this reducing disaccharide on acrylamide formation. A mathematical model, incorporating glucose, fructose and maltose and based on known Maillard reaction pathways, was developed which showed that acrylamide formation from maltose only contributed < 10% to the total acrylamide. An additional kinetic model allowed for the formation of acrylamide directly from sugar-asparagine glycoconjugates. This model suggested that under these conditions, it is unlikely that acrylamide is formed directly from the maltose-asparagine conjugate.

AB The present study evaluated four laticifer fluids as a novel source of peptidases capable of hydrolyzing proteins in cow's milk. The latex peptidases from Calotropis procera (CpLP), Cryptostegia grandiflora (CgLP), and Carica papaya (CapLP) were able to perform total hydrolysis of caseins after 30 min at pH 6.5, as confirmed by a significant reduction in the residual antigenicity. Casein hydrolysis by Plumeria rubra latex peptidases (PrLP) was negligible. Moreover, whey proteins were more resistant to proteolysis by latex peptidases; however, heat pretreatment of the whey proteins enhanced the degree of hydrolysis and reduced the residual antigenicity of the hydrolysates. The in vivo assays show that the cow's milk proteins hydrolysed by CgLP and CapLP exhibited no immune reactions in mice allergic to cow's milk, similar to a commercial partially hydrolysed formula. Thus, these peptidases are promising enzymes for the development of novel hypoallergenic formulas for children with a milk allergy.

AB Effect of citronella essential oil (CEO) fumigation on sprout suppression and quality of potato tubers during storage was investigated. Potato tubers were treated under conditions of single-phase (30 mu L L-1, 0-10 d) and dual-phase (30 mu L L-1, 0-10 d; 30 mu L L-1, 35-90 d) fumigation. Changes in germination rate, weight loss, starch, reducing sugar, gibberellins (GA3), and alpha-solanine were measured. The results showed that CEO fumigation could control sprouting and improve the quality of potato tubers during storage compared to the non-treated tubers. CEO treatments inhibited the degradation of starch and the increase of reducing sugar content. The production of gibberellins (GA3) was suppressed, and the levels of alpha-solanine in the skin and flesh of potato tubers were decreased by CEO fumigation. Dual-phase CEO fumigation had a better effect on sprout suppression than single-phase fumigation, and possesses potential for postharvest application.

AB In this work, an analytical method for the determination of Cd and Pb in natural coconut water samples, industrialized coconut water samples and coconut milk using high-resolution continuum source graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (HR-CS GF AAS), after minimum treatment of the sample was developed. The analytical method was applied to 46 samples collected in Salvador, Bahia (Brazil). The ranges of concentrations obtained were: 0.42-18.72 mu g L-1 Cd and< 0.70-36.32 mu g L-1 Pb for natural coconut water samples (n = 14);< 0.06-1.49 mu g L-1 Cd and 6.57-29.02 mu g L-1 Pb for industrialized water coconut samples (n = 16); and< 0.10-5.93 ng g(-1) Cd and< 0.85-22.41 ng g(-1) Pb for coconut milk samples (n = 16). For all samples, Cd and Pb concentrations were below the maximum tolerated values recommended by Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency (Agencia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitaria, ANVISA).

AB The aim of this study was to determine the content of ochratoxin A (OTA) using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in selected food products, in the aspect of consumer health hazards. In the study 473 samples of food products, available on the Silesia market in Poland, were analyzed. For the determination of ochratoxin A in food, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection was used. Almost 22% of the samples were contaminated with ochratoxin A. The highest concentration of OTA was determined in raisins (34.0 mu g/kg), which exceeds the permissible level 3.5 times. In one of the analyzed rye flour samples ochratoxin A was determined at level 19.5 mu g/kg, where the maximum level is 3 mu g/kg. For the general population, there is a risk of exposure to ochratoxin A from food, which justifies the need to monitor the quality of products for mycotoxin contamination.

AB The gelatinization behavior of rice flour and isolated starch and the texture of cooked rice were examined both for fresh and aged samples successively. The whole and debranched starch molecular structures of the starches extracted from the flour and hot water-washed leachate of the cooked rice were characterized, using size-exclusion chromatography, to elucidate the molecular origins of the functional changes. For all variety, the native and leached starches of the aged rice had significantly smaller average total molecular sizes, higher proportions of short amylopectin chains, and smaller average chain length of amylopectin compared to fresh rice. The structural changes are consistent with the observed higher peak and final viscosity, lower pasting temperature, greater hardness and lower stickiness of cooked rice kernels for aged rice, based on established structure-property relationships. This study can be used to suggest ways in which some improved functional properties could be obtained with less expenditure for storage.

AB Benzimidazoles (BZDs) are widely used veterinary drugs in the domestic food-producing animals, resulting in the metabolism of BZDs and the harmful metabolites residues in some foods. However, some BZD metabolites are unknown and so it is important to discover new metabolites to expand detection targets. For these reasons, a sensitive and selective strategy was designed to identify BZD metabolites in the serum of pigs after oral administration of albendazole, fenbendazole and thiabendazole, respectively. Nickel oxide nanoparticle-deposited silica (SiO2@NiO) composite was used for the enrichment and purification of BZD compounds. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with precursor ion scan-mass spectrometry (LC-PIS-MS) and high resolution MS/MS analysis (HR-MS/MS) was employed for the BZDs metabolic profiles characterization and metabolites detection. Finally, 18 BZD metabolites were identified, among which 11 metabolites were discovered in pig serum for the first time. Besides, more comprehensive BZD metabolic pathways were presented.

AB The potential for 42 different polyphenols found in Vaccinium fruits to bind to peanut allergen Ara h 2 and inhibit IgE binding epitopes was investigated using cheminformatics techniques. Out of 12 predicted binders, delphinidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside, procyanidin C1, and chlorogenic acid were further evaluated in vitro. Circular dichroism, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and immunoblotting determined their capacity to (i) bind to Ara h 2, (ii) induce protein secondary structural changes, and (iii) inhibit IgE binding epitopes. UV-Vis spectroscopy clearly indicated that procyanidin C1 and chlorogenic acid interacted with Ara h 2, and circular dichroism results suggested that interactions with these polyphenols resulted in changes to Ara h 2 secondary structures. Immunoblotting showed that procyanidin C1 and chlorogenic acid bound to Ara h 2 significantly decreased the IgE binding capacity by 37% and 50%, respectively. These results suggest that certain polyphenols can inhibit IgE recognition of Ara h 2 by obstructing linear IgE epitopes.

AB Bio-electronic tongue was linked to artificial intelligence processing unit and used for classification of wines based on carboxylic acids levels, which were indirectly related to malolactic fermentation. The system employed amperometric biosensors with lactate oxidase, sarcosine oxidase, and fumarase/sarcosine oxidase in the three sensing channels. The results were processed using two statistical methods - principal component analysis (PCA) and self-organized maps (SOM) in order to classify 31 wine samples from the South Moravia region in the Czech Republic. Reference assays were carried out using the capillary electrophoresis (CE). The PCA patterns for both CE and biosensor data provided good correspondence in the clusters of samples. The SOM treatment provided a better resolution of the generated patterns of samples compared to PCA, the SOM derived clusters corresponded with the PCA classification only partially. The biosensor/SOM combination offers a novel procedure of wine classification.

AB This study examined high voltage atmospheric cold plasma (HVACP) technology as a non-thermal intervention for inactivating Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 (ST2) in tender coconut water (TCW). Treatment with HVACP in air at 90 kV for 120 s inactivated 1.30 log(10) of ST2. Development of a TCW stimulant suggested an interfering role of magnesium and phosphate salts with HVACP inactivation. Generation of reactive gas species, viz. ozone and hydrogen peroxides were found to be responsible for microbial inactivation. The addition of 400 ppm citric acid to the TCW effectively reduced ST2 by 5 log(10) during HVACP treatment. Under these conditions, higher cellular leakage and morphological damage were observed in ST2. Minimal physico-chemical changes in TCW were observed with HVACP treatment, except for an 84.35% ascorbic acid loss (added externally). These results demonstrate a potential pathway for developing highly effective cold plasma treatments to preserve fruit and vegetable juices.

AB Grain quality is a major breeding objective and paramount to food production. This study was aimed to phenotypically and molecularly dissect the rice grain quality, especially amylose content (AC), grain protein content (GPC) and alkali spreading value (ASV), using the USDA rice mini-core collection representing the world-wide rice germplasm lines. Grain chemical analysis combined with genome-wide association study (GWAS) was used for the study. A wide genetic variation was observed for these grain quality traits in the mini-core collection. Germplasm lines unique in AC, GPC and ASV and desirable for grain quality improvement were identified. The genetic diversity of the collection was re-analyzed using new SNPs, thus providing a more precise genotypic information about the collection. Furthermore, ten loci significantly associated with these grain quality traits were identified through GWAS using 22947 high-quality SNPs. These results, therefore, provide knowledge, resources and molecular tools for efficient rice grain quality improvement.

AB Berries of four gooseberry (Ribes uva-crispa L.) cultivars of Invicta, Rixanta, Karat and Black Negus and five currant (Ribes L.) cultivars of NS 11, Focus, Ben Gairn, Otelo and Viola were evaluated as potential sources of bioactive compounds with extraordinary antioxidant activity. Their total phenolic, flavonoid and anthocyanin contents were determined in the range of 3.52-30.77 g GA.kg(-1), 2.83-17.35 g RE.kg(-1) and 0.03-186.12 mg COG.100 g(-1), respectively. Furthermore, quantification of phenolic compounds and vitamins was established by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection. Flavonoids were the most abundant phenolic substances in the range of 345.0-3726.5 mg.kg(-1). Ascorbic acid and vitamin E were established in the amounts of 6.2-14.04 g.kg(-1) and 0.43-12.85 mg.kg(-1), respectively. Considering all analyzed factors and antioxidant activities determined by various methods (DPPH, ACW and ACL), red gooseberry Black Negus and black currant Otelo were the most significant cultivars.

AB Protein composition and molecular weight play an important role in the digestibility of microalgae proteins. In this study for the first time, proteinous materials of Dunaliella salina and Spirulina platensis were extracted and purified by fast protein liquid chromatography. Then, they are affected by trypsin and chymotrypsin as indicator intestinal enzymes.
   The results showed that the extracted protein from S. plantesis (ProS) was more rapidly hydrolysed than proteins from D. salina (ProD) because of their lower molecular weight and likely their greater flexibility and open structure. Also, the extent of hydrolysis by trypsin and chymotrypsin of ProS were higher and faster than ProD due to the more number of hydrolytic sites in ProS for both enzymes. The catalytic efficiency and k(cat) displayed that ProS were more suitable substrate than ProD for intestinal enzymes. The results exhibited that chymotrypsin can act better and faster than trypsin on peptide bonds of proteins.

AB It is imperative to ensure biological products are free of contaminating pyrogenic material prior to administration to patients. Historically the rabbit pyrogen test (RPT) was used to screen for such contamination in medicines for intravenous delivery. This test was adapted for use to screen vaccines. However, some, including meningococcal vaccines containing outer membrane vesicles, are intrinsically pyrogenic. Indeed, this is the case for Bexsero which contains relatively high levels of endotoxin and other potential pyrogens such as lipoproteins and porins. The RPT proved a difficult method for measuring the pyrogenic content of Bexsero and differences between laboratories in different countries made repeat testing at the control laboratories problematic resulting in batches being wrongly identified as unsafe. At NIBSC a monocyte activation test (MAT) was adapted and validated as an alternative. This required setting of a specification in-house and deciding on a decisional procedure using multiple donors, allowing batches equally pyrogenic or less, than those batches shown to be safe in a clinical trial, to be certified as safe. The resulting format was a reference comparison method with an upper limit of 1.8 relative pyrogen units (RPU). The batch passed if an initial four donors had a response equal to or less than 1.8 RPU, if one donor is above this limit the batch was tested in a further four donors and seven of the eight must be equal to or below 1.8 RPU. If two donors have a response greater than 1.8 the batch failed. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pyrogen content is one of the critical quality attributes impacting the safety of a product, and there is an increasing need for assays that can reliably measure this attribute in vaccines. The Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay and the rabbit pyrogen test (RPT) are the canonical animal-based pyrogen tests currently used to release vaccines; however, there are several drawbacks associated with these tests when applied to Bexsero, intrinsically pyrogenic product, containing a meningococcal Outer Membrane Vesicle component. While the RPT, as applied to Bexsero at its given dilution, ensures safe vaccine, it is highly variable and prone to false positive results. On the other hand, the LAL assay although quantitative, can detect only endotoxin pyrogens and is not sufficient for monitoring the safety of Bexsero, which contains both LPS and non-endotoxin pyrogens. Being aware of these limitations of the RPT and LAL when applied to Bexsero, the Monocyte Activation Test (MAT) which is sensitive to both endotoxin and non-endotoxin based pyrogens has been developed as an alternative pyrogen test. Here, the development and the validation of a MAT assay adapted from the European pharmacopoeia for Bexsero, is described. The MAT assay is then used for monitoring the safety and consistency of Bexsero vaccines at release, providing great advantages in terms of reduced variability with respect to RPT, reduction of animal use, in line with the 3Rs principle concerning the protection of animals and faster time to market. In addition the correlation of the MAT to the RPT has been demonstrated supporting the replacement of the in vivo method and the potential application of the assay to other intrinsically pyrogenic vaccines.

AB The aim of this collaborative study was to evaluate the robustness of the monocyte activation test (MAT) for quantifying the pyrogenic content in the outer membrane vesicle (OMV)-containing vaccine Bexsero: the first meningococcal B vaccine to be licenced. We analysed datasets from 9 laboratories covering 15 test systems for 3 batches of Bexsero with higher, equivalent and lower activity relative to a reference lot in the MAT. Activity was measured in terms of relative pyrogen units (RPU) based on European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) MAT Chapter 2.6.30 Method C: Reference Lot Comparison Test. We report that all 15 test systems were consistent in that they showed sample A to be the most active in the MAT; that 13 of 15 test systems had an accuracy of more than 80% and an overall geometric mean RPU of 1.03 with lower and upper 95% confidence limits of 0.97 and 1.09 respectively fora sample with an expected value of 1.00 RPU. We also report larger variability in the results for test systems involving cells from individual blood donations for sample A suggesting that there could be donor to donor differences in sensitivity to the vaccine constituents responsible for the higher activity of this batch. Overall, the consistency and accuracy of the MAT was remarkable given the range of test systems used by participants, all of which are permitted by the Ph. Eur. General MAT Chapter. This is important given the limitations of the rabbit pyrogen test for the control of pyrogenicity in general and particularly with products with intrinsic pyrogenicity such as Bexsero.

AB We are interested in developing a vaccine that prevents genital herpes. Adjuvants have a major impact on vaccine immunogenicity. We compared two adjuvants, an experimental Merck Sharp & Dohme lipid nanoparticle (LNP) adjuvant, LNP-2, with CpG oligonucleotide combined with alum for immunogenicity in mice when administered with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) glycoproteins C, D and E (gC2, gD2, gE2). The immunogens are intended to produce neutralizing antibodies to gC2 and gD2, antibodies to gD2 and gE2 that block cell-to-cell spread, and antibodies to gE2 and gC2 that block immune evasion from antibody and complement, respectively. Overall, CpG/alum was better at producing serum and vaginal IgG binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies, antibodies that block virus spread from cell-to-cell, and antibodies that block immune evasion domains on gC2. We used a novel high throughput biosensor assay to further assess differences in immunogenicity by mapping antibody responses to seven crucial epitopes on gD2 involved in virus entry or cell-to-cell spread. We found striking differences between CpG/alum and LNP-2. Mice immunized with gD2 CpG/alum produced higher titers of antibodies than LNP-2 to six of seven crucial epitopes and produced antibodies to more crucial epitopes than LNP-2. Measuring epitope-specific antibodies helped to define mechanisms by which CpG/alum outperformed LNP-2 and is a valuable technique to compare adjuvants. (C) 2019 The Authors.

TI Healthcare costs associated with varicella and herpes zoster in Norway
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Cost of illness; Varicella; Herpes zoster
ID MORTALITY
AB Background: Norway does not implement routine vaccination against varicella or herpes zoster. Despite substantial health burden associated with both diseases, their economic impact is not well described. The aim of the present study was to document the healthcare costs associated with both conditions in a Norwegian setting.
   Methods: We used registry data about patients' contacts with primary and specialized healthcare services from 2008 to 2014 to estimate the costs associated with varicella and herpes zoster in the primary and hospital care sector. We calculated the individual costs by treatment facility (general practitioner and emergency primary care clinic) in primary care and by treatment level (inpatient, outpatient or ambulatory treatment) at hospitals.
   Results: We estimate that the annual healthcare cost of patients with varicella and herpes zoster are NOK 85 million (approximately (sic) 9 million). Of the annual costs, 73% are associated with herpes zoster and 27% are due to varicella. The majority (54%) of the total annual cost is represented by patients with herpes zoster treated in hospital.
   Conclusion: Varicella and herpes zoster impose a substantial financial burden on the national healthcare services in Norway. Most of the costs are incurred by herpes zoster, which could be prevented by vaccination. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   EXPRESSION
AB Campylobacter is the leading bacterial cause of human enteritis in developed countries. Chicken is a major natural host of Campylobacter. Thus, on-farm control of Campylobacter load in poultry would reduce the risk of human exposure to this pathogen. Vaccination is an attractive intervention measure to mitigate Campylobacter in poultry. Our previous studies have demonstrated that Campylobacter outer membrane proteins CmeC (a component of multidrug efflux pump) and CfrA (ferric enterobactin receptor) are feasible and promising candidates for vaccine development. In this study, by targeting these two attractive vaccine candidates, we explored and evaluated a new vaccination strategy, which combines the in ovo vaccination route and novel DNA vaccine formulation, for Campylobacter control in broilers. We observed that direct cloning of cfrA or cmeC gene into the eukaryotic expression vector pCAGGS did not lead to sufficient level of production of the target proteins in the eukaryotic HEK-293 cell line. However, introduction of the Kozak consensus sequence (ACCATGG) in the cloned bacterial genes greatly enhanced production of inserted gene in eukaryotic cells, creating desired DNA vaccines. Subsequently, the validated DNA vaccines were prepared and used for two independent in ovo vaccination trials to evaluate their immune response and protective efficacy. However, single in ovo injection of specific DNA vaccine at 18th day of embryonation, regardless using neutral lipid-protected vector or not, failed to trigger significant IgG and IgA immune responses and did not confer protection against C. jejuni colonization in the intestine of chickens. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the Kozak sequence is critically important for construction of the DNA vaccine expressing prokaryotic gene. The optimal regimen for in ovo vaccination of DNA vaccine for Campylobacter control in poultry needs to be determined in future studies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Antibodies to Circumsporozoite protein (CSP) confer protection against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Although CSP is highly immunogenic, it does not induce long lasting protection and efforts to improve CSP-specific immunological memory and duration of protection are underway. We have previously reported that the clinical grade CSP vaccine FMP013 was immunogenic and protective against malaria challenge in mice when combined with the Army Liposomal Formulation adjuvant containing immune modulators 3D-PHAD (TM) and QS21 (ALFQ). To move forward with clinical evaluation, we now report the safety, toxicity and immunogenicity of clinical grade FMP013 and ALFQ in Rhesus macaques. Three groups of Rhesus (n = 6) received half or full human dose of FMP013 + ALFQ on a 0-1-2 month schedule, which showed mild local site reactions with no hematologic derangements in red blood cell homeostasis, liver function or kidney function. Immunization induced a transient systemic inflammatory response, including elevated white blood cell counts, mild fever, and a few incidences of elevated creatine kinase, receding to normal range by day 7 post vaccination. Optimal immunogenicity in Rhesus was observed using a 1 mL ALFQ+ 20 mu g FMP013 dose. Doubling the FMP013 antigen dose to 40 mu g had no effect while halving the ALFQ adjuvant dose to 0.5 mL lowered immunogenicity. Similar to data generated in mice, FMP013 + ALFQ induced serum antibodies that reacted to all regions of the CSP molecule and a Th1-biased cytokine response in Rhesus. Rhesus antibody response to FMP013 + ALFQ was found to be non-inferior to historical benchmarks including that of RTS,S + AS01 in humans. A four-dose GLP toxicity study in rabbits confirmed no local site reactions and transient systemic inflammation associated with ALFQ adjuvant administration. These safety and immunogenicity data support the clinical progression and testing of FMP013 + ALFQ in a CHMI trial in the near future. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DT Article
DE Measles; Laboratory tests; Sensitivity
ID INFECTION
AB Background: Measles-containing vaccine (MCV) was introduced in 1965 in Beijing and given to the children aged 8m-14y. In population-based surveillance system, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoglobulin M(IgM) serology tests have been conducted for each suspected case since 2013. We used the surveillance data to evaluate the adequacy of the tests for laboratory confirmation during 2014-2016.
   Methods: Informations on IgM tests, RT-PCR, age, vaccination history for confirmed cases were from the surveillance system. Laboratory confirmed cases were defined as cases with positive IgM serology and/or positive RT-PCR. All tests were conducted in the laboratories accredited by Beijing CDC or Beijing CDC laboratory.
   Results: Totally 4600 cases were confirmed. Sensitivities of IgM tests within 0-3 days post rash, IgM tests within 4-28 days post rash and RT-PCR within 0-3 days post rash were 56.53%, 82.06% and 94.39%, respectively. The combined sensitivity of IgM tests and RT-PCR decreased by the interval between rash onset and collection of virologic specimen. MCV immunization history lowered sensitivity of IgM tests and RT-PCR. Among the cases aged >= 15 years, around 95% had no written immunization records. The sensitivity of IgM tests within 0-3 days post rash was less than 60%. Around 60% had unknown immunization histories. Compared with unvaccinated cases based on written records, unvaccinated cases based on recollection had no significantly different sensitivity of laboratory tests. But unknown immunization history significantly lowered sensitivity of RT-PCR within 0-3 days post rash.
   Conclusions: Neither IgM tests nor RT-PCR reached 100% sensitive for confirmed cases. Virologic specimen should be collected as early as possible to achieve maxim sensitivity. Cases with unknown immunization history could not be treated as unvaccinated. Combination of the two tests and further laboratory assays were needed especially for vaccinated cases or cases aged >= 15 years. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) produced by the Staphylococcus aureus bacteriumis most commonly associated with food poisoning and is known to also cause toxic shock syndrome. Currently, no approved vaccine or specific drug is available to treat SEB intoxication. In this study, we fabricated dissolving microneedles (MNs) loaded with recombinant SEB (rSEB) protein, and evaluated its characteristics, including dissolution profile, protein particle size, insertion depth, antigen retention time in vivo, and skin irritation. Our results showed that rSEB protein-loaded dissolving MNs made of chondroitin sulfate (2%) and trehalose (0.8%) could easily penetrate into the mouse skin within 5 min. The rSEB particle size was unchanged before and after MN fabrication. The skin penetration depth of the MNs was 260 mu m. Moreover, the MNs also significantly extended the antigen retention time in vivo. rSEB protein-loaded dissolving MNs also triggered slight erythema at the beginning of administration, but this erythema disappeared within a few hours. More importantly, we investigated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of rSEB protein-loaded dissolving MNs. Challenge studies in mice revealed that mice in full-dose MN group had a high level of SEB specific antibody response thatprovided100% protection against a lethal SEB toxin challenge. However, there was only 60% protection observed in mice that were in the half-dose MN (dose sparing) group. We also determined the pathological alterations in the tissues of the immunized mice. Taken together, these dissolving MNs may present a promising transcutaneous immunization strategy for treating SEB intoxication. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: The demand on effective and safe anthrax vaccine is increasing as a part of the preparedness for possible bioterrorism in the future. We performed a randomized, single-blind, placebo controlled phase 11 clinical study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a novel recombinant protective antigen (rPA) anthrax vaccine, GC1109, in healthy adult volunteers.
   Methods: Participants were randomized to experiment groups (0.3 mL, 0.5 mL, and 1.0 mL of GC1109) or placebo group (normal saline 0.5 mL) in 2:2:2:1 ratio. They received respective vaccines intramuscularly at 0, 4 and 8 weeks. Immunogenicity was evaluated by seroconversion rate and geometric mean titer (GMT) of lethal toxin neutralizing assay (TNA) and anti-PA IgG by ELISA. Safety was assessed by laboratory tests, and solicited and unsolicited adverse events on diary cards.
   Results: 30, 29, 30 participants were randomized to 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 mL of GC1109 groups, respectively, while 15 to placebo group. 92 participants received all three doses. In per-protocol analysis, TNA GMTs at week 12 were 296.5, 285.2, and 433.2 in the three groups, respectively. Seroconversion rates measured by ELISA were 100% at week 12 in the three groups. Local and systemic vaccine-related adverse events were frequent; however, most of them were mild, and no serious events were observed.
   Conclusions: A new rPA anthrax vaccine GC1109 was immunogenic after three doses of intramuscular administration, and was well-tolerated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Currently, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccine purity is tested in cattle to detect antibodies against the non-structural protein (NSP) after repeated immunization with the final vaccine product. In case of vaccine failure, the manufacturing company would suffer significant economic loss. To prevent such unfortunate losses with the final vaccine product, in vitro testing is required to quantitate an NSP antigen during the manufacturing process prior to animal experiments. A novel lateral-flow assay device was developed using a monoclonal antibody (MAb) against the 3B NSP. To determine the minimal amount of NSP required to elicit antibodies in livestock, goats were immunized several times with various concentrations of either the recombinant 3AB (rec.3AB) protein or FMD virus culture supernatant. Antibodies against 3AB were elicited after a second immunization with 10.6 ng to 42.5 ng of rec.3AB and a third immunization with a 10-fold diluted FMD virus culture supernatant in goats. The lateral-flow assay device detected the minimal amount of rec.3AB and native NSP in FMD virus culture supernatant required to induce NSP antibodies in goats. The in vitro assay device is simple and economical, provides rapid results, and should be useful for FMD vaccine-manufacturing companies prior to conducting animal experiments to test the vaccine purity.

AB The combination of optimized DNA constructs, improved formulations and advanced in vivo electroporation (EP) has been shown to generate potent and efficacious immune responses in the clinic. Needle-free jet injection has also been reported to improve DNA vaccine delivery over standard needle and syringe in clinical trials. Here we investigated the impact of combined jet injection and EP (Jet-EP) delivery on muscle transfection efficiency and DNA vaccine immunogenicity in rabbits and nonhuman primates (NHPs) compared to jet injection alone. Our results show that the addition of EP significantly enhanced in vivo DNA transfection efficiency of rabbit muscle over jet injection alone. Jet-EP delivery augmented the rate and magnitude of DNA vaccine induced humoral and cellular responses over jet injection alone in both rabbits and NHPs. Jet-EP delivery also resulted in higher proportions of polyfunctional antigen specific T cells producing IFN gamma, IL-2, and/or TNF alpha. Elevated antibody levels were sustained nine months post immunization in NHPs immunized with a DNA vaccine using Jet-EP delivery, far outperforming jet delivery alone. Our results provide proof-of-concept that addition of advanced EP to needle-free jet injection delivery improves in vivo DNA transfection efficiency, increasing the magnitude, rate and duration of cellular and humoral immune responses to DNA vaccines. This combination likely has significant advantages in important vaccine and immunotherapy settings. (C) 2019 Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV7 and PCV13) in children has led to a change in the pattern of pneumococcal serotypes causing pneumococcal disease in adults. The aim of this study is to analyze the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes in adults with bacteremic pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia (BPP) after the introduction of PCVs in childhood, and the impact of age and comorbidity on this distribution. We conducted an observational study of all adults hospitalized with BPP between 2001 and 2014, in two tertiary hospitals. Overall, we identified 451 cases of BPP (2001-2005: 194, 2006-2010: 134, 2011-2014: 123). The rate of appearance of new cases decreased over the study period. In 70% of the cases, the serotypes found were among those included in PCV13. The most prevalent serotypes were 3 (23.1%), 7F (14.6%), 19A (8.4%) and 1 (7.5%). There was a significant trend to decrease in the percentage of BPP cases due to PCV7 from period 2001-2005 to 2011-2014 (p = 0.0166) and a significant trend to increase in the six serotypes added to form PCV 13 (p = 0.0003). Serotype 3 was the most frequent in patients who developed complications during hospitalization. We did not detect a significant increase in cases caused by non-PCV13 serotypes. The most frequent non-PCV13 serotype was 22F. In conclusion, a significant proportion of adults continue to develop BPP with vaccine serotypes despite infant pneumococcal vaccination. There is a need for further strategies to reduce the current burden of this disease on adults. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID INFLUENZA VACCINE EFFECTIVENESS; OLDER-ADULTS; FUNCTIONAL STATUS;

AB Background: Frailty is an important physiologic factor in studies of influenza and influenza vaccines carried out in older adults and hospitalized populations. Unfortunately, comprehensive assessments of frailty requiring physical assessments and extensive medical record review are not often feasible in time- and resource-limited settings common to studies of influenza and influenza vaccines.
   Methods: We developed a 5-question frailty short interview, and implemented it in a multicenter, hospital-based study of influenza over two years. Frailty status defined by the frailty short interview was compared to a validated frailty index based on medical record review of 59 parameters. Agreement between the two frailty measures was assessed, and multivariable linear regression models were used to explore differences between the measures. The association between each frailty measure and likelihood of influenza vaccination was also assessed.
   Results: During the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 influenza seasons, 2070 adult patients hospitalized with acute respiratory illness were enrolled and included in analyses. Frailty was frequently identified in the study population; 43% of participants were defined as frail by the frailty short interview and 32% by frailty index. Responses to the frailty short interview were only moderately correlated with the frailty index, and agreement between the two frailty measures was low. Women were more likely to be defined as frail by the frailty short interview than men. White individuals were more likely than other races to be defined as frail by the frailty index. Increasing frailty index was associated with increased likelihood of influenza vaccination, but the frailty short interview was not associated with vaccination.
   Conclusions: The frailty short interview provided a feasible and consistent measure of frailty across study hospitals and study years. However, its modest correlation with the frailty index and differential association with likelihood of influenza vaccination highlight differences in the conceptualization of frailty.

AB Background: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have been actively monitoring the risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) following influenza vaccination among Fee-for-Service (FFS) Medicare beneficiaries every season since 2008. We present our evaluation of the GBS risk following influenza vaccinations during the 2017-2018 season.
   Methods: We implemented a multilayered approach to active safety surveillance that included near real-time surveillance early in the season, comparing GBS rates post-vaccination during the 2017-2018 season with rates from five prior seasons using the Updating Sequential Probability Ratio Test (USPRT), and end-of-season self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) analyses.
   Results: We identified approximately 16 million influenza vaccinations. The near real-time surveillance did not signal for a potential 2.5-fold increased GBS risk either in days 8-21 or 1-42 post-influenza vaccination. In the SCRI analyses, we did not detect statistically significant increased GBS risks among influenza-vaccinated Medicare beneficiaries >= 65 years for either the 8-21 or 1-42-day risk windows for all seasonal vaccines combined, high-dose vaccine, or standard-dose vaccines; we did detect an increased GBS risk in days 8-21 post-vaccination for individuals vaccinated with the adjuvanted vaccine (OR: 3.75; 95% CI: 1.01, 13.96), although this finding was not statistically significant after multiplicity adjustment (p = 0.146).
   Conclusions: Our multilayered surveillance approach-which allows for early detection of elevated GBS risk and provides reliable end-of-season SCRI estimates of effect size-did not identify an increased GBS risk following 2017-2018 influenza vaccinations. The slightly increased GBS risk with the adjuvanted vaccine, which was not statistically significant following multiplicity adjustment, is consistent with the package inserts of all U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines, which warn of a potential low increased GBS risk. The benefits of influenza vaccines in preventing morbidity and mortality heavily outweigh this potential risk. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this work, we explore the effects of O-acetylation on the physical and immunological characteristics of the WHO International Standards of Vi polysaccharide (Vi) from both Citrobacter freundii and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. We find that, although structurally identical according to NMR, the two Vi standards have differences with respect to susceptibility to de-O-acetylation and viscosity in water. Vi standards from both species have equivalent mass and O-acetylation-dependent binding to a mouse monoclonal antibody and to anti-Vi polyclonal antisera, including the WHO International Standard for human anti-typhoid capsular Vi PS IgG. This study also confirms that human anti-Vi sera binds to completely de-O-acetylated Vi. Molecular dynamics simulations provide conformational rationales for the known effect of de-O-acetylation both on the viscosity and antigenicity of the Vi, demonstrating that de-O-acetylation has a very marked effect on the conformation and dynamic behavior of the Vi, changing the capsular polysaccharide from a rigid helix into a more flexible coil, as well as enhancing the strong interaction of the polysaccharide with sodium ions. Partial de-O-acetylation of Vi revealed hidden epitopes that were recognized by human and sheep anti-Vi PS immune sera. These findings have significance for the manufacture and evaluation of Vi vaccines. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Although the administration of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine has been widespread in the United States for decades, gaps in vaccine coverage still persist for various reasons. The maintenance of herd immunity against rubella virus (RV) is important to controlling the spread and resurgence of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome.
   Methods: In this study, we sought to assess the seroprevalence of RV-specific antibodies in an adult population from a defined geographic area in Olmsted County, MN, and the surrounding municipalities, with relatively high vaccine coverage and no documented evidence of circulating RV in the past 24 years. Rubella-specific IgG antibodies were measured by ELISA in a large set of serum samples (n = 1393) obtained from the Mayo Clinic Biobank. This cohort was 80.2% female and ranged from 20 to 44 years of age.
   Results: In total, 97.8% of subjects were seropositive for rubella-specific IgG antibodies, with a median titer of 40.56 IU/mL, suggesting a high degree of immunization; however, 2.2% of subjects were found to be seronegative. Interestingly, 25.1% of subjects were seropositive but had titers lower than 25 IU/mL, indicating either a population of low responders or individuals that could potentially be at risk of waning immunity. No significant associations or differences were found between RV-specific titers and demographic variables such as age, sex, or body mass index (BMI).
   Conclusions: A high rate of seropositivity for rubella was found among this young adult cohort, but a significant percent of the cohort had lower titers that may indicate poor initial vaccine response and potential risk if their antibody titers decline.

AB Introduction: Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) are at high risk to contract human papillomavirus (HPV). While an effective vaccination exists, its use among YMSM is markedly lower compared to non-MSM and women. This study compares scaling up HPV vaccination in conjunction with other prevention strategies.
   Methods: An agent-based model of urban YMSM (<= 26 years of age) reflective of the demography of Philadelphia, PA, simulated for up to ten years of follow-up to examine anal and oral transmission of the HPV genotypes covered in the nonavalent (9v) vaccine: 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58. Starting HPV prevalences ranged from a high of 18% (type 6) to a low of 6% (type 31); overall 65% of individuals carried any HPV genotype. Simulated levels of vaccination were ranged from 0% to 13% (present-day level), 25%, 50%, 80% (Healthy People 2020 target), and 100% in conjunction with condom use and HIV seroadaptive practices. The primary outcome was the relative reduction in HPV infection.
   Results: Compared to present-day vaccination levels (13%), scaling-up vaccination led to expected declines in 10-year post-simulation HPV prevalence. Anal HPV (any 9v types) declined by 9%, 27%, 46%, and 58% at vaccination levels of 25%, 50%, 80%, and 100%, respectively. Similarly, oral HPV (any 9v types) declined by 11%, 33%, 57%, and 71% across the same levels of vaccine uptake. Comparing the prevention strategies, condoms blocked the greatest number of anal transmissions when vaccination was at or below present-day levels. For oral transmission, vaccination was superior to condom use at all levels of coverage.
   Conclusions: Public health HPV preventions strategies should continue to emphasize the complementary roles of condoms and vaccination, especially for preventing oral infection. Improving vaccination coverage will ultimately have the greatest impact on reducing HPV infection among YMSM. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the principal cause of nosocomial diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis associated with antibiotic therapy. The pathological effects of CDI are primarily attributed to toxins A (TcdA) and B (TcdB). Adequate toxin-specific antibody responses are associated with asymptomatic carriage, whereas insufficient humoral responses are associated with recurrent CDI. While the data supporting the importance of anti-toxin antibodies are substantial, clarity about the toxin domain specificity of these antibodies is more limited. To investigate this matter, combinations of human mAbs targeting multiple domains of TcdB were assessed using toxin neutralization assays. These data revealed that a combination of mAbs specific to all major toxin domains had improved neutralizing potency when compared to equivalent concentrations of a single mAb or a combination of mAbs against one or two domains. The function and toxin domain binding specificity of serum antibodies elicited by immunization of hamsters with a toxoid vaccine candidate was also assessed. Immunization with a toxoid vaccine candidate provoked toxin neutralizing antibodies specific to multiple domains of both TcdA and TcdB. When assessed in a toxin neutralization assay, polyclonal sera displayed greater activity against elevated concentrations of toxins than equivalent concentrations of individual mAbs. These data suggest a potential benefit of any antibody based therapeutic or prophylactic treatment that targets multiple toxin domains. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The identification of adjuvants that promote lasting antigen-specific immunity and augment vaccine efficacy are integral to the development of new protein-based vaccines. The Ebola virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine expressing Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP) and matrix protein (VP40) was used in this study to evaluate the ability of TLR4 agonist glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant (GLA) formulated in a stable emulsion (SE) to enhance immunogenicity and promote durable protection against mouse-adapted Ebola virus (ma-EBOV). Antibody responses and Ebola-specific T cell responses were evaluated post vaccination. Survival analysis after lethal ma-EBOV challenge was performed 4 weeks and 22 weeks following final vaccination. GLA-SE enhanced EBOV-specific immunity and resulted in long-term protection against challenge with ma-EBOV infection in a mouse model. Specifically, GIA-SE elicited Th1-skewed antibodies and promoted the generation of EBOV GP-specific polyfunctional T cells. These results provide further support for the utility of TLR4 activating GLA-SE-adjuvanted vaccines. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: HIV disproportionately impacts transgender populations globally, creating challenges to inclusion in trials requiring low HIV risk profiles (LHRP) for acquisition. Our knowledge of transgender individuals with LHRP is limited. We conducted an analysis of transgender and cisgender individuals in HVTN trials enrolling individuals with LHRP.
   Methods: We analyzed data from 694 participants enrolled in the phase 1-2a HVTN trials in the US and Peru from 2009 to 2014 that included individuals who reported gender identity (GI) differing from assigned birth sex (transgender [TG]), and compared them with those who reported a congruent GI (cisgender [CG]).
   Results: 681 participants (98%) were CG and 13 (2%) were TG. Mean age was 25 years. 16% were Hispanic and most (69%) were White. Reasons for enrolling included to help find an effective vaccine (TG 100%; CG 98%) and help their community (TG 100%; CG 96%). Significant differences by GI were observed in reported pre-existing conditions (p = 0.004); however, approximately 10% of pre-existing conditions reported by TG were GI-related (e.g., gender dysphoria). Significant differences were observed in hormone therapy use (p < 0.001) and mental health medications (p = 0.007). Retention was excellent with 2.1% missed visits and no discontinuations of vaccination for TG and 3% missed visits and 7.1% discontinuations among CG. There was no statistically significant difference in HIV incidence.
   Conclusions: Primary reasons for participation were altruistic for all participants. Comparable to CG counterparts, TG participants maintained LHRP, followed trial procedures, and had high retention, facilitating meaningful early phase HIV preventive vaccine trial contributions.

AB Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been recommended in the United States since 2006 for routine vaccination of girls at age 11-12 years and through age 26 years for women not previously vaccinated. Changes in vaccine-type HPV (VT) prevalence can be used to evaluate vaccine impact, including herd effects.
   Methods: We determined type-specific HPV in cytology specimens from women aged 20-29 years screened for cervical cancer at Kaiser Permanente Northwest in 2007 and in two vaccine era periods: 2012-2013 and 2015-2016. Detection and typing used Ll consensus PCR with hybridization for 37 types, including quadrivalent vaccine types (HPV 6/11/16/18).
   Results: Among 20-24 year-olds in 2012-2013 and 2015-2016, 44% and 64% had a history of >= 1-dose vaccination. VT prevalence decreased from 13.1% in 2007 to 2.9% in 2015-2016 (prevalence ratio [PR] = 0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17-0.29). HPV 31 prevalence was also lower in the vaccine periods compared with 2007. VT prevalence in 2015-2016 among 20-24 year-olds was lower in both vaccinated, 1.3% (PR = 0.10; 95% CI 0.06-0.16), and unvaccinated women, 5.8% (PR = 0.45; 95% CI 0.33-0.61). Among 25-29 year-olds, 21% and 32% had a history of >= 1-dose vaccination. VT prevalence decreased from 8.1% in 2007 to 5.0% in 2015-2016 (PR = 0.62; 95% CI 0.50-0.78). Non-VT high risk prevalence was higher in the vaccine periods compared with the pre-vaccine era in both age groups, however, not in 2015-2016 compared with 2012-2013.
   Conclusion: Within 9-10 years of vaccine introduction, VT prevalence decreased 78% among 20-24 year-olds and 38% in 25-29 year-olds. There were declines in both vaccinated and unvaccinated women, showing evidence of direct and herd protection. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID PROTECTION; DESIGN
AB Influenza outbreaks occur periodically in Long Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) and vaccination is critical in preventing influenza infections. We evaluated the influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) during respiratory outbreaks in LTCFs reported to the Ministry of Health, Singapore in 2017.
   A test-negative design was used to estimate the ratio of the odds of testing positive for influenza among vaccinated individuals to the odds among unvaccinated individuals. The VE was calculated as (1-odds ratio) x 100%. For adjusted VE, the estimates were derived using logistic regression adjusted for age group, gender, month of illness, and number of days from date of illness onset till to swab collection date. Estimates by influenza subtypes and post-vaccination time periods (15-180 days & 181-365 days) were also calculated using stratified data.
   264 individuals, with 118 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases [32 A(H1N1)pdm09, 75 A(H3N2), 11 A (untypable)], were included in the analysis. No one was identified to be infected with influenza B. The overall adjusted VE estimate was 40.5% (95% CI: -12.2-68.5%), while the subtype-specific adjusted VE estimates were -43.4% (95% CI: -312.4-50.2%) against A(H1N1)pdm09 and 57.1% (95% CI: 5.7-80.5%) against A(H3N2). At 15-180 days post-vaccination period, the adjusted VEs were 59.3% (95% CI: 18.0-79.8%) against all influenza, 35.4% (95% CI: -123.5-81.3%) against A(H1N1)pdm09 and 67.9% (95% CI: 22.5-86.7%) against A(H3N2). Estimates were not significant at 181-365 days post-vaccination.
   The influenza vaccine showed varying effectiveness among individuals in Singapore's LTCFs in 2017, with a higher effectiveness among those who were more recently vaccinated. It remains an important tool in preventing influenza infections, especially for those who are at high risk of influenza-related complications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Polymorphisms at -176 in IL-6, and -238 and -308 in TNF-alpha have been described as risk factors for developing tuberculosis (TB) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, it is not known how these changes influence the development of TB-T2DM comorbidity. The objective of this work was therefore to analyze the impact of these polymorphisms in the Mexican population.
   This is a cross-sectional study of cases and controls in which polymorphisms at -174 in IL-6, -238 and -308 in TNF-alpha were identified in healthy subjects, those with TB, T2DM and carriers of the comorbidity, each group consisted of 30 individuals. Descriptions of the population, frequency of genotypes and risk association were calculated, and a reduction of multifactorial dimensionality between groups (MDR) was determined.
   Genotype 174 G/G-of IL-6 was observed in 78% of individuals, while -308 G/G and -238 G/G of TNF-alpha occurred in 90% and 91% of individuals, respectively. The -174 G/G IL-6 in individuals with T2DM increased five-fold (p = .02) the risk of developing the comorbidity. The MDR analysis showed that the association of -174 G/G IL-6 and -308 G/G TNF-alpha in healthy individuals increased the risk of developing the comorbidity up to six-fold (p = .019), while in individuals with T2DM, this risk augmented 14-fold (p = .0002).
   The -174 G/G IL-6 genotype increases the risk of developing comorbidity in the T2DM population and this risk is raised when associated with -308 G/G TNF-alpha. These findings have implications for understanding the epidemiological dynamics of the TB-T2DM comorbidity, promoting prevention strategies and inhibiting the development of this co-morbidity.

AB Three important factors, including genetics, environment factors and autoimmunity play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The heritability of RA has been accounted to be 50-60%, while the HLA involvement in heritability of the disease has been accounted to be 10-40%. It has been documented that shared epitope (SE) alleles, such as HLA-DRB1*01 and DRB1*04, some HLA alleles like HLA-DRB1*13 and DRB1*15 are connected to RA susceptibility. An advanced classification of SE categorizes SE alleles into four main groups namely, S1, S2, S3D, and S3P. The S2 and S3P groups have been linked to susceptibility of seropositive RA. Various genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have discovered many susceptibility loci implicated in pathogenesis of RA. Some of the important single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to RA are TRAF1, STAT4, CTLA4, IRF5, CCR6, PTPN22, IL23R, and PADI4. HLA and non-HLA genes may discriminate anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody-positive and anti-CCP-negative RA groups. Furthermore, risk of the disease has also been linked to environmental agents, mainly cigarette smoking. Pharmacogenomics has also confirmed SNPs or genetic patterns that might be linked to drugs responses. Different aspects of genetic involvement in the pathogenesis, etiology, and RA complications are reviewed in this article.

AB P450c17, a key enzyme in the steroid generation pathway, plays an important role in the production of sex steroid and cortisol. In this study, two cyp17 gene isoforms, Pocyp17-I and Pocyp17-II were isolated from Paralichthys olivaceus gonads. Domain architecture analysis of Pocyp17-I and Pocyp17-II revealed that they had three regions important to enzymatic function. Structural analysis showed that Pocyp17-I and Pocyp17-II had 8 and 9 exons respectively, and the difference was caused by the insertion of an extra intron (intron1) in the latter. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results indicated that the expression of these two genes showed sexually dimorphism that Pocyp17-I and Pocyp17-II were highest expressed in testis and ovary, respectively. The in situ hybridization analysis of gonads indicated that Pocyp17-I and Pocyp17-II mRNA were both detected in oocytes, spermatocytes and Sertoli cells. After injection of androgen and estrogen (17 alpha-methyltestosterone, 17 beta-estradiol) of different concentrations, the expression level of Pocyp17-I decreased significantly (P < 0.01), whereas estrogen had no influence on Pocyp17-II, but androgen upregulated the expression of Pocyp17-II (P < 0.05). Moreover, Pocyp17-I expression level was down-regulated significantly by NROb1 but up-regulated by NR5a2 (P < 0.05), whereas Pocyp17-II expression level was down-regulated significantly by NROb1 and NR5a2 (P < 0.05). All these results demonstrated that there were differences in expression patterns, feedback actions of sex hormones and transcriptional regulations between cyp17-I and cyp17-II, which revealed that cyp17-I and cyp17-II might perform different functions in sex hormones biosynthesis and gonadal differentiation in Japanese flounder.

AB The protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) gene family is one of the momentous and conserved plant-specific gene families, known to participate in cellular processes via reversible protein phosphorylation and regulates signal transduction in eukaryotic organisms. Recently, PP2Cs were identified in Arabidopsis and maize, however, the whole-genome analysis of PP2C in strawberry has not yet been reported. In the current research, we found 62 PP2C-encoding genes in total from the strawberry genome. Further, the phylogenetic analysis categorized FvPP2C genes into twelve subgroups with significant structural conservation based on conserved domain and amino acid sequence. Moreover, we observed a strong signature of purifying selection between the comparison of orthologous gene pairs of strawberry and Arabidopsis. The comparison of RNA-sequence (RNA-seq) data published on various vegetative and reproductive tissues of strawberry plant suggested the significant role of FvPP2C genes in organ development. The qRT-PCR validation of thirty FvPP2C genes indicated their critical tolerance-related role under abiotic stress stimuli in strawberry. Finally, the subcellular localization of FvPP2C51 gene proves that it resides and stimulates its function in the nucleus. Our findings provide an overview of the identification of strawberry FvPP2C gene family and demonstrate their critical role in tissue-specific response and abiotic stress-tolerance, thereby, intimating their significance in the strawberry molecular breeding for the resistant cultivars.

AB Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis is the etiologic agent of veterinary relevance diseases, such as caseous lymphadenitis, affecting different animal species causing damage to the global agribusiness. So far, there are no completely effective treatment methods to overcome the impacts caused by this pathogen. Several genomes of the species are deposited on public databases, allowing the execution of studies related to the pan-genomic approach. In this study, we used an integrated in silico workflow to prospect novel putative targets using the core genome, a set of shared genes among 65 C. pseudotuberculosis strains. Subsequently, through RNA-Seq data of the same abiotic stresses in two strains, we selected only induced genes to compose the reverse vaccinology workflow based in two different strategies. Our results predicted six probable antigens in both analysis, which indicates that they have a strong potential to be used in further studies as vaccine targets against this bacterium.

AB Current protocols for therapy inefficiently targets triple negative breast cancer and barely eradicate cancer stem cells. Elucidation of the pleiotropic effect of clinically proven therapeutics on cancer cells shed light on novel application of old friends. The pleiotropic effect of acetaminophen (APAP) on breast cancer was previously reported. In a cell model of triple negative breast cancer with stem-like CD44(high)/CD24(low) phenotype, we screened the impacts of APAP (1 mM, 72 h) on the Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related expression of miRs. APAP significantly overexpressed hsa-miR-130a-3p, 192-5p, 214-3p, 101-3p, 30d-5p, 10a-5p, 99a-5p, 200c-3p, 143-3p, 30b-5p and let-7f-5p showed significant overexpression, but suppressed the expression of hsa-miR-7-5p, 149-3p, 215, 150-5p, 205-5p, 206, 10b-5p, 20b-5p, 145-5p, 26b-5p, 223-3p, 17-5p, 186-5p, 146a-5p and let-7c. It also altered on the expression of selected EMT -related genes, significantly upregulated the expression of KRT19, AKT2, CD24, and TIMP1; but downregulated the expression of MMP2, ALDH1, MMP9, TWIST, NOTCH1, and AKT1. Such shifts in expression profiles increased the population of the cells with CD44(high)/CD24(high) and CD44(low)/CD24(high) phenotypes, significantly reduced the Twist protein and shifted the balance of E-cadherin and Vimentin proteins in favor of differentiation. Treated cells showed a significant reduction of in vitro migration and were significantly chemosensitized to Camptothecin. In conclusion, APAP, at a safe clinical dose, induced a set of targeted alterations in the EMT -related miRs which implicate, even in part, significant mitigation in chemoresistance and in vitro migration. Further studies should also be piloted to elucidate the most crucial miRs and to evaluate its clinical effectiveness.

AB There are many DNA taxonomy methods available, but single-locus data coupled with distance-based analyses still dominate species identification in practice. Genetic distance thresholds are often used for assigning genetic diversity into entities corresponding to species but are criticized for non-universality or arbitrary. This study investigated an alternative approach for determining genetic thresholds that used iteratively sister-Glade clustering for sister species boundary detection within a phylogenetic framework. This method was separately applied to two close subfamilies of Callosciurinae and Sciurinae in Rodentia using the cyt b gene. Our results showed that genetic thresholds for Callosciurinae and Sciurinae were 4.0% and 6.0%, respectively, indicating that the optimized thresholds could be lineage-specific. The use of these thresholds for taxa partitioning yielded a very similar putative species number as the prevailing ABGD method, and increased species diversity by 74.2% and 20.7% in Callosciurinae and Sciurinae, respectively. This suggested that additional cryptic species were present that warrant further investigation. We further tested the performance limitation of our method by simulating the impacts of tree construction and sampling limitation. The results showed that it preformed equally well for different trees but failed to work when inter- or intraspecific sampling is insufficient. These findings support the feasibility of this approach as an alternative tool for species delineation when only single-locus information is available for large datasets.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary cancer of the liver with high mortality and frequent recurrence. Although various therapies provide potential cure for HCC patients, unfortunately the five-year survival rate of advanced HCC remains dismal. It is critical to explore the pathogenesis of HCC and identify novel biomarkers for early HCC diagnosis. PSMD4 is a major receptor of the 26S proteasome involved in ubiquitindependent and proteasome-mediated protein degradation. In our study, PSMD4 was overexpressed in HCC tissues and cell lines determined by Northern blot, western blot and immunohistochemistry. The silencing of PSMD4 blocked cell proliferation and tumor growth, induced cell apoptosis and inhibited the proteasome activity. Western blot results showed that the knockdown of PSMD4 blocked the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), phosphorylated Sarcoma tyrosine kinase (P-SRC) and Bcl-2, but improved the levels of p53 and Bax in HCC, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer and endometrial cancer cell lines. Taken together, these findings indicated that the subunit of 26S proteasome PSMD4 exerts as an oncogene in HCC and other cancers via regulating the expression p53, Bcl-2 and Bax. These findings enriched the pathogenesis of HCC, and provided a new biomarker for cancers diagnosis and a new target for cancers therapy.

AB Coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) is one of the most characteristic plants of tropical areas. Coconut oil and its derivatives have been widely used in various industries. In this paper, a type 2 diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT2), which is one of the key enzymes involved in triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis, was first characterized in coconut pulp (endosperm). The results indicated that CoDGAT2 was highly expressed in coconut pulp approximately 7 months after pollination. The heterologous expression of CoDGAT2 in the mutant yeast H1246 restored TAG biosynthesis in the yeast, which exhibited substrate preference for two unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), palmitoleic acid (C16:1) and oleic acid (C18:1). Moreover, the seed-specific overexpression of CoDGAT2 in Arabidopsis thaliana led to a significant increase in the linoleic acid (C18:2) content (approximately 6%) compared with that in the wild type. In contrast, the proportions of eicosadienoic acid (C20:1) and arachidic acid (C20:0) were decreased. These results offer new insights on the function of CoDGAT2 in coconut and provide a novel molecular target for lipid genetic modification to change the fatty acid (FA) composition of oils.

AB Autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO) is a rare genetic bone disease characterized by dense and fragile bone, caused by a defect in osteoclasts responsible for the bone destruction. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mutations in TCIRG1 and SNX10 that are responsible for 50% and 4% of the cases, respectively. All amplicons were sequenced by Sanger sequencing following PCR amplification. As a result, six different mutations of the TCIRG1 gene were found in five of the twelve unrelated cases. These include two novel mutations, namely c.630 + 1G > T mutation and c.1778_1779delTG mutation of the gene which are identified as homozygous. A compound heterozygosity of known mutations c.649_674del26 and c.1372G > A and homozygous presence of the known c.2235 + 1G > A mutation were also observed in different patients, In addition, as a result of the prenatal testing in a family with osteopetrosis infant, the c.1674-1G > A mutation was detected as homozygous for the fetus. In TCIRG1, c.166C > T change, which is indicated as likely benign according to ClinVar database, was heterozygous. Several known polymorphisms; c.117 + 83T > C, c.417 + 11A > G and c.714-19C > A in TCIRG1 gene; c.24 + 36T > A and c.112-84G > A in SNX10 gene were also detected. In conclusion, our study revealed that five of the twelve cases carry at least one mutation of TCIRG1 gene. Further studies with more patients and other genes would help better understanding of genetic etiology of the disease.

AB Teosinte branched 1/Cycloidea/Proliferating cell factor 1 (TCP) proteins belongs to a plant-specific transcription factor family that plays important roles in plant development. TCP gene-regulated plant branching occurs downstream in the strigolactone pathway. In this study, 41 TCP genes were identified in the genome of Panicum virgatum L. (switchgrass). These genes all contained the TCP conserved domain, and they belonged to two subfamilies distributed across 18 chromosomes. Analysis of gene expression using RNA-Seq data showed that 16 TCP genes were highly expressed in the inflorescence and shoot. The expression patterns of 13 selected PvTCP genes were analyzed in different tissues, and their responses to strigolactones (SLs) were examined. The selected genes were expressed differentially in a range of tissues and to application of SLs, indicating that PvTCPs were involved in a range of developmental and physiological processes. This genome-wide analysis and determination of PvTCP gene-expression patterns yielded valuable information on switchgrass development that will inform studies into improving switchgrass and other species for crop production.

AB Kallmann syndrome (KS) is characterized by the association of anosmia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is due to deficient production, secretion or action of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Mutations in transcription factor SOX10 have been recently identified in patients with KS and hearing loss. In this study, we identified three novel SOX10 mutations in a cohort of Chinese KS patients by using exome sequencing. Two mutations (A44G and L80V) are in heterozygous state whereas the other one (G41V) is a homozygous mutation. The patient with a homozygous G41V mutation had impaired hearing in both ears, whereas the patient with a heterozygous L80V mutation showed subtle hearing impairment in the left ear. Functional studies indicated that all three SOX10 mutations showed reduced capacity to transactivate the MITF promoter alone or in synergy with PAX3, although they showed similar subcellular localization, and DNA binding ability. Our study further highlighted the significance of SOX10 haploinsufficiency as a genetic cause of KS with hearing problem.

AB Osteopontin (OPN) is involved in the regulation of the immune response and is accused in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). An obvious link between OPN and T cells, particularly T helper 17 cells is reported, where OPN produced by dendritic cells supports interleukin-17 (IL-17) expression, contributing to pathology of autoimmune disorders. The aim of the study was to investigate the association of genotypes and alleles frequencies of OPN 9250 (rs1126616) and IL-17A 197 (rs2275913) genes polymorphisms with their serum levels, susceptibility, disease activity and severity in Egyptian SLE patients. A total of 80 SLE patients and 80 healthy subjects were enrolled. The PCR-RFLP technique was used to detect OPN 9250 C/T and IL-17A 197 G/A genes polymorphisms. Serum OPN and IL-17 levels were measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. OPN TT genotype and T allele were significantly detected in SLE patients more than controls (P = 0.003, P < 0.001 respectively). IL-17A AA genotype showed non-significant higher frequency in SLE patients than in their controls (P = 0.07). While only the A allele of IL-17A polymorphism was significantly elevated in patients (P = 0.048). There was statistical significant association between OPN CT and TT genotypes and both renal and mucocutaneous manifestations. Also IL-17A AG and AA genotypes was significantly associated with renal, mucocutaneous in addition to the hematological manifestations. Serum OPN levels were significantly increased with TT genotype while serum IL-17 levels were significantly increased with AA genotype. Disease activity and severity scores were significantly elevated with both OPN TT and IL-17A AA genotypes. In conclusion, OPN 9250 C/T and IL-17A 197 G/A genes polymorphisms and their serum levels seemed to have a role in pathogenesis of SLE.

AB Aim Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a frequent and debilitating complication of diabetes mellitus. The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) is a multifunctional cell surface receptor playing critical roles in lipoprotein metabolism and several cell signaling processes. C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) is a main conduit to endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis. We aimed to investigate LRP1 and CHOP gene expression in peripheral blood cells of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) subjects to clarify its possible relation to DPN pathogenesis.
   Method: The study included 20 non-complicated T2DM subjects, 20 subjects with DPN and 20 healthy controls. Quantitative real time PCR was used to study gene expression.
   Results: There was a significant reduction in LRP1 mRNA expression and a significant increase in CHOP mRNA expression in subjects with DPN compared to non-complicated group and healthy controls. Both LRP1 and CHOP expression levels were inversely correlated, and both showed significant correlation with HbA1c, hyperlipidemia, hs-CRP, and different electrophysiological parameters. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis suggested that both LRP1 and CHOP mRNA expression and hs-CRP levels had great potential advantages to predict the progression of DPN.
   Conclusion: LRP1 and CHOP might be involved in DPN pathogenesis and progression, thus providing opportunities for early detection and treatment.

AB Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 5 regulates the development and periodicity of hair follicles, which can affect hair traits. Loss-of-function mutations associated with long-hair phenotypes have been described in several mammalian species. Sheep is an important economic animal, however, the evolution characterizations and biological mechanism of oFGF5 (Ovis aries FGF5) gene are still poorly understood. In this study, oFGF5 gene was obtained by resequencing the whole genome of three Dorper sheep and RACE of two Kazakh sheep FGF5. We proposed FGF5 was phylogenetically related to FGF4 family and oFGF5 clearly orthologed to goat FGF5. Six loci were found from the positive selection results of FGF5 and half of them located on signal peptide. The basically similar rates of function-altering substitutions in sheep and goat lineage and the rest of the mammalian lineage of 365 SNPs indicated that the FGF5 gene was quite conservative during evolution. Homology modeling of the oFGF5 suggested that it has a highly conserved FGF superfamily domain containing 10 beta-strands. Furthermore, the protein-protein docking analysis revealed that oFGF5 have the potential to form heterodimers with oFGFR1, the predicted interaction interface of FGF5-FGFR1 heterodimer was formed mainly by residues from FGF superfamily domain. Our observations suggested the evolutionary and structural biology features of oFGF5 might be relevant to its function about hair follicle development and modulating hair growth, and we confirmed our speculation by using the FGF5 gene editing sheep produced by CRISPR/Cas9 technology.

AB Phosphofructokinase plays an essential role in sugar metabolism in plants. Plants possess two types of phosphofructokinase proteins for phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate, the pyrophosphate-dependent fructose-6-phosphate phosphotransferase (PFP), and the ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase (PFK). Until now, the gene evolution, expression patterns, and functions of phosphofructokinase proteins were unknown in pear. In this report, 14 phosphofructokinase genes were identified in pear. The phylogenetic tree indicated that the phosphofructokinase gene family could be grouped into two subfamilies, with 10 genes belonging to the PbPFK subfamily, and 4 genes belonging to the PbPFP subfamily. Conserved motifs and exon numbers of the phosphofructokinase were found in pear and other six species. The evolution analysis indicated that WGD/Segmental and dispersed duplications were the main duplication models for the phosphofructokinase genes expansion in pear and other six species. Analysis of cis-regulatory element sequences of all phosphofructokinase genes identified light regulation and the MYB binding site in the promoter of all pear phosphofructokinase genes, suggesting that phosphofructokinase might could be regulated by light and MYB transcription factors (TFs). Gene expression patterns revealed that PbPFP1 showed similar pattern with sorbitol contents, suggesting important contributions to sugar accumulation during fruit development. Further functional analysis indicated that the phosphofructokinase gene PbPFP1 was localized on plasma membrane compartment, indicating that PbPFP1 had function in plasma membrane. Transient transformation of PbPFP1 in pear fruits led to significant increases of fructose and sorbitol compared to controls. Overall, our study provides important insights into the gene expression patterns and important potential functions of phosphofructokinase for sugar accumulation in pear fruits, which will help to enrich understanding of sugar-related bio-pathways and lay the molecular basis for fruit quality improvement.

AB The genetic defects of a 12-year-old patient with factor XIII deficiency (FXIIID) and eight pedigree members suspected with FXIIID were studied. Clinical diagnosis, pedigree investigation, phenotypic study and genetic analysis were performed. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the proband had a novel deletion mutation of F13A1 gene (NM_000129: exon 12: c.1652delC: p.Thr551LysfsTer26) which he inherited from both the parents who were heterozygous for the same 1652delC deletion. This frameshift (p.Thr551LysfsTer26) led in homozygous form to severe FXIIID. Additionally, a homozygous missense mutation of NBEAL2 gene (NM_015175: exon 13: c.1367C > T: p.Ala456Val) was identified in the proband. Again, the mutation was inherited from both the parents who were heterozygous for the same c.1367C > T novel mutation. Other members of the pedigree were also revealed to be heterozygous for the same proband's F13A1 and NBEAL2 genes mutations. We first report a pedigree with pathogenic F13A1 gene mutation and a novel mutant NBEAL2 gene.

AB Obesity increases the risk of developing hypertension. Since both pathological entities constitute public health problems, the aim of this study was to investigate RNA expression of adiponectin, leptin and their receptors in adipose tissue in women with class 3 obesity, with or without hypertension. Serum concentrations of these adipokines were also quantitated. Women with obesity and hypertension (n = 22) and with obesity without hypertension (n = 37) were included. All patients presented class 3 obesity, without diabetes mellitus. The expression of mRNA in: adiponectin, ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 was analyzed in visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue; leptin and its receptor were only analyzed in SAT, by reverse transcription quantitative PCR. Measurements of adiponectin and leptin concentrations were performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Analysis of mRNA expressions in VAT and SAT are presented as median and quartiles. Analysis of serum concentrations of adipokines are presented as median and percentiles 25th-75th.
   Women presenting a higher mean arterial pressure, had significantly higher levels of mRNA expression of adiponectin in SAT. Besides, we found several significant positive correlations of these adipokines and their receptors.
   In conclusion, we found that those women with a higher mean arterial pressure and receiving anti-hypertensive treatment, presented higher levels of mRNA expression of adiponectin in SAT.

ID PHENOTYPE ASSOCIATION; HSA-MIR-191; EXPRESSION; CANCER; LOCUS; GENE
AB Irregular methylation, including DNA hypomethylation and/or promoter gene CpG hypermethylation, is involved in the pathogenesis of several solid tumors, including liver cancer. miRNAs are small, endogenous, noncoding RNAs that serve as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. Previous research has focused on identifying the factors that regulate the expression of miRNAs in hepatic carcinogenesis. The factors that regulate miRNA expression are not clear; in particular, the role of DNA methylation, an epigenetic regulatory factor that controls miRNA transcription, has not been clarified. The goal of this study is to explore our understanding of the mechanism by which HCC may develop and progress through identification of the role of epigenetically regulated miRNAs influences in the liver carcinogenesis. The current study included 60 patients who were well diagnosed as HCC patients. 60 patients who suffer from liver cirrhosis were also enrolled in the current study and 30 healthy control subjects who serve as control group. All patients will be subjected to: full clinical assessment, abdominal ultrasound, Blood sample will be withdrawn from every patients for both biochemical and serum detection of microRNAs (191-203 -335) by real time PCR. We found that all studied microRNAs were down regulated among HCC patients when compared to cirrhotic patients and controls (p value: 0.005, 0.005 and 0.001 for microRNAs 191, 203 and 335 respectively). Moreover, these microRNAs can discriminate cases of HCC from risky cirrhotic patients. We can conclude that downregulated microRNAs among HCC cases proposed a pattern to explain the role of DNA methylation on miRNA and gene expression in HCC.

AB Secondary cell wall (SCW) thickening provides the mechanical force for anther dehiscence and plays an important role in the formation of xylem structure. We have previously reported that gamma MYB2, a MYB coiled-coil protein, directly binds to the P1BS cis-element of the PLA(2)-gamma promoter and acts as a co-activator of gamma MYB1 in controlling the expression of PLA(2)-gamma. In this study, we analyzed morphological phenotypes of the constitutive overexpression (gamma MYB2-OE) and knock-down (gamma MYB2-KD) lines of gamma MYB2. We found that gamma MYB2 over-expression caused the collapse of the endothecium layer, thereby suppressing anther dehiscence and forming short infertile siliques. The gamma MYB2-OE also showed less cellulose deposition in the xylem and had a longer primary stem than the wild-type, while gamma MYB2-KD had greater cellulose accumulation and a shorter primary stem than the wild-type. We demonstrated that the male sterility and the longer primary stem in gamma MYB2-OE were caused by reduced expression of SCW thickening-related genes. Our results suggest that gamma MYB2 acts as a negative regulator in controlling the SCW thickening in Arabidopsis.

AB TLRs are thought to play a role in the pathophysiology of such dermatological diseases as leprosy, acne and psoriasis.
   The study included 20 patients with plaque psoriasis, as well as 20 healthy age- and gender-matched control subjects. Real-time polymerase chain reaction evaluation was made of the messenger RNA expression of TLRs 1-10 in lesional tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples in psoriasis patients.
   TLR 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 lesional tissue mRNA expressions were increased significantly when compared to the expression levels in the PBMCs of the same patients (p = 0.0082, p = 0.0176, p = 0.0239, p = 0.0261, p = 0.0223, p = 0.0206). A comparison of the TLR expression in the PBMCs of healthy subjects and the PBMCs of patients with psoriasis showed a significant increase in the TLR 1, 8 and 10 mRNA expressions in the patient group (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p = 0.0035). The TLR 5 mRNA expression was significantly higher in the control group than in the patient group (p = 0.0037).
   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in literature to evaluate mRNA TLR expression levels in the lesional tissue and PBMCs of patients with psoriasis.

AB The light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding (Lhc) superfamily, composed of several distinct antennae protein families, plays essential roles in light capture and photoprotection in plants. Compared with the extensive research in Arabidopsis thaliana and certain species, little is known about this superfamily in cassava (Manihot esculenta), an Euphorbiaceous plant experienced one so-called rho recent whole-genome duplication (WGD). This study presents the first genome-wide identification of Lhc supergene family in cassava, resulting in 35 members that are distributed across 15 chromosomes. Phylogenetic analysis and BRH (Best Reciprocal Hit)-based sequence comparison assigned these genes into four previously defined families and 26 orthologous groups (including one absent from Arabidopsis). Synteny analysis showed that nine identified duplicates were derived from the WGD as well as local duplication, and retention bias of WGD duplicates in this species was shown to be something different from that in Arabidopsis which experienced two recent WGDs. Transcriptional profiling of MeLhc superfamily genes revealed a predominant expression pattern in green tissues such as leaf and midvein. Moreover, comparison of exon-intron structures, protein motifs, and gene expression profiles revealed divergence of duplicate pairs. Our findings will not only improve our knowledge on the evolution of this superfamily in cassava, but also provide valuable information for further functional studies.

AB Programmed death-1 (PD-1) has a pivotal role in the attenuation of adaptive immune responses and peripheral tolerance. Here we describe the identification of the Pekin duck programmed death-1 orthologue (duPD-1). The duPD-1 cDNA encodes a 283-amino acid polypeptide that has an amino acid identity of 70%, 32% and 31% with chicken, murine and human PD-1, respectively. The duck PD-1 gene shares five conserved exons with chicken, murine and human PD-1 genes. A cluster of putative regulatory elements within the conserved region B (CR-B) of the basal promotor is conserved. Homology modeling was most compatible with the two beta-sheet IgV domain structure of murine PD-1. Contact residues, shown to be critical for binding of the respective human and murine PD-1 ligands are mostly conserved between avian and mammalian species, whereas residues that define the cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM) are highly conserved across higher vertebrates and frog. Constitutive expression of duPD-1 transcripts was predominantly found in lymphocyte-rich tissues, and mitogen-stimulation of duck peripheral blood mononuclear cells transiently increased duPD-1 mRNA expression. A soluble duPD-1 protein was expressed and shown to engage the identified duck PD-1 ligands. Our observations show considerable evolutionary conservation between mammalian and avian PD-1 orthologues. This work will facilitate further investigation of the role of PD-1 signaling in adaptive immunity in the Pekin duck, a non-mammalian vertebrate and pathogen host with relevance for human and animal health.

AB Alcohol intake increases the risk of cancer development. Approximately 3.6% human cancers worldwide derive from chronic alcohol drinking, including oral, liver, breast and other organs. Our studies in vivo and in vitro have demonstrated that diluted ethanol increase RNA Pol III gene transcription and promotes cell proliferation and transformation, as well as tumor formation. However, it is unclear about the effect of red wines on the human cancer cells. In present study, we investigated the roles of red wine in human cancer cell growth, colony formation and RNA Pol III gene transcription. Low concentration (12.5 mM to 25 mM) of ethanol enhances cell proliferation of breast and esophageal cancer lines, whereas its higher concentration (100 mM to 200 mM) slightly decreases the rates. In contrast, red wines significantly repress cell proliferation of different human cancer lines from low dose to high dose. The results reveal that the red wine also inhibits colony formation of human breast cancer and esophageal carcinoma cells. The effects of repression on different human cancer lines are in a dose-dependent manner. Further analysis indicates that ethanol increases RNA Pol III gene transcription, whereas the red wines significantly reduce transcription of the genes. Interestingly, the effects of mature wine (brick red) on cancer cell phenotypes are much stronger than young wine (intense violet). Together, these new findings suggest that red wines may contain some bioactive components, which are able to inhibit human cancer cell growth and colony formation.

AB Eukaryotic transcription is a highly regulated fundamental life process. A large number of regulatory proteins and complexes, many of them with sequence-specific DNA-binding activity are known to influence transcription by RNA polymerase (pol) II with a fine precision. In comparison, only a few regulatory proteins are known for pol III, which transcribes genes encoding small, stable, non-translated RNAs. The pol III transcription is precisely regulated under various stress conditions. We used pol III transcription complex (TC) components TFIIIC (Tfc6), pol III (Rpc128) and TFIIIB (Brf1) as baits and mass spectrometry to identify their potential interactors in vivo. A large interactome constituting chromatin modifiers, regulators and factors of transcription by pol I and pol II supports the possibility of a crosstalk between the three transcription machineries. The association of proteins and complexes involved in various basic life processes like ribogenesis, RNA processing, protein folding and degradation, DNA damage response, replication and transcription underscores the possibility of the pol III TC serving as a signaling hub for communication between the transcription and other cellular physiological activities under normal growth conditions. We also found an equally large number of proteins and complexes interacting with the TC under nutrient starvation condition, of which at least 25% were non-identical under the two conditions. The data reveal the possibility of a large number of signaling cues for pol III transcription against adverse conditions, necessary for an efficient co-ordination of various cellular functions.

This paper therefore analysed the individual discrimination power of 8 low penetrant common genetic variants and calculated the predictive accuracy of the genetic risk model.
   The study enrolled 171 women with developed breast cancer (57.06 +/- 11.60 years) and 146 control subjects (50.24 +/- 10.69 years). The genotyping was performed by high resolution melting method (HRM) and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and the Random Forest algorithm provided the ROC curve with AUC values.
   Significant association with BC was confirmed in 2 SNPs: rs2981582 FGFR2 and rs889312 MAP3K1, and the odds ratios of homozygotes with two risk alleles in both SNP's were higher than in heterozygotes with one mutant allele, as follows: FGFR2 TT: 1.953 (95% CI 1.014-3.834, p = 0.049), CT 1.771 (95% CI 1.088-2.899, p = 0.026) and MAP3K1 CC 2.894 (95% CI 1.028-9.566, p = 0.048), AC 1.760 (95% CI 1.108-2.813, p = 0.019). FGFR2 had the best discrimination ability, followed by MAP3K1 and CASP8. Discriminative accuracy of the genetic risk model distinguishing the breast cancer patients and controls explained by AUC was 0.728, with 70.6% sensitivity and 65.1% specificity.
   Our study results therefore confirmed polygenic breast cancer inheritance with important involvement of FGFR2, MAP3K1, LSP1 and CASP8 gene variants.

AB The mitochondrial genome is an independent genetic system in each eukaryotic cell outside the nuclear genome. Mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) appears in high copy number within one cell, unlike nuclear DNA, which exists in two copies. But nevertheless, mtDNA represent only small part of total cellular DNA what causes problematic analysis and identification of relevant mutations. While most researchers tend to overlook it because of its small size, the mitochondrial genome contains genes that are essential for cellular energetics and survival. Because of the increased awareness on the importance of metabolism and bioenergetics in a wide variety of human diseases, more and more mtDNA studies were performed. Mitochondrial genome research has established the connection between mtDNA and a wide variety of diseases such as cancer or neurodegenerative disorders. At the present time, several methods are known, that allow sequencing of mtDNA. However, genomic analysis is often complicated due to the low content of mtDNA compared to nuclear DNA. For this reason, we have designed a new approach to obtaining the genomic mitochondrial sequence. We chose RNA based sequencing. Since human mtDNA does not contain introns, the reconstruction of whole mitochondrial genome through RNA sequencing seems to be effective. Our method is based on total RNA sequencing coupled with simple ultracentrifugation protocol and de novo assembly. Following our protocol, we were able to assemble a complete mammalian mitochondrial genome with a length of 16,505 bp and an average coverage of 156. The method is a relatively simple and inexpensive which could help in the further research or diagnostics of mtDNA-based diseases.

AB Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER alpha) is a ligand-activated transcription factor and it has a prominent role in both physiological and pathological processes of the reproductive system. ER alpha has been investigated extensively in breast cancer and the MCF-7 breast-cancer-derived cell line is a widely used model for the study of its behavior. In this paper we provide a systematic catalog of the possible scenarios of binding to more than 80,000 ER alpha transcription factor binding sites based on the mechanism of ER alpha binding to DNA (upon both vehicle and estradiol (E2) treatment). A key feature of the estrogen-driven genetic programs is the presence or absence of the specific response element referred to as the estrogen response element (ERE). While ER alpha-driven super-enhancers are key components of estrogen-dependent genetic programs, three additional classes of enhancers could be identified: one with the presence of ERE where the ER alpha bound to the DNA prior of E2-treatment, one where the E2 was required for ER alpha binding even in the presence of ERE, and one where the ER alpha binding is established through the response elements of the collaborating factors. Our results suggest that different scenarios of ER alpha binding result in different genetic programs.

AB Targeted, quantitative metabolomics can, in principle, provide precise information on intracellular metabolite levels, which can be applied to accurate modeling of intracellular processes required in systems biology and metabolic engineering. However, quantitative metabolite profiling is often hampered by biased mass spectrometry-based analyses caused by matrix effects, the degradation of metabolites and metabolite leakage during sample preparation, and unexpected variation in instrument responses. Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry (IDMS) has been proven as the most accurate method for high-throughput detection of intracellular metabolite concentrations, and the key has been the acquisition of the corresponding fully uniformly (U)-C-13-labeled metabolites to be measured. Here, we have prepared U-C-13-labeled cell extracts by cultivating P. chrysogenum in a fed-batch fermentation with fully U-C-13-labeled substrates. Towards this goal, a dynamic fed-batch model describing P. chrysogenum growth and penicillin production was used to simulate the fermentation process and design the fed-batch fermentation media. Further, a case study with extensive intracellular metabolomics data from glucose-limited cultivation of Penicillium chrysogenum under both single and repetitive glucose pulses was illustrated by using the IDMS methods with the prepared U-C-13-labeled cell extracts as internal standards. In conclusion, the IDMS method can be incorporated into well-established fast sampling and quenching protocols to obtain dynamic quantitative in vivo metabolome data at the timescales of (tens of) seconds and elucidate the underlying regulatory architecture. The case study revealed gross differences between single and repeated pulses, which suggests that single pulse studies have limited value for understanding of metabolic responses in large-scale bioreactors. Instead, intermittent feeding should be favored.

AB Fetal fraction and the chromosome representation are the two key quantities used in Non-Invasive Prenatal Screening (NIPS) to determine the aneuploidy status of a fetus. Several methods for fetal fraction determination have been proposed in the literature, including a class of the methods, denoted snpFF, based on high-coverage targeted sequencing of highly polymorphic Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). The variant of snpFF, investigated here, has similar properties as the other variants of snpFF. We point out that the variability of the individual informative SNPs-based estimates of fetal fraction increases with the increase of fetal fraction. At 4% fetal fraction the Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) of the individual estimates of fetal fraction is around 3% and it increases to 6% at 15% fetal fraction. snpFF cannot detect fetal fraction below 2.5% because the number of informative SNPs becomes too small, even zero.

AB Highly efficient asymmetric reduction of 2-octanone to (R)-2-octanol catalyzed by immobilized Acetobacter sp. CCTCC M209061 cells was achieved in a biphasic system. Bioreduction conducted in aqueous single phase buffer was limited due to poor solubility and toxicity towards cells cause by product accumulation. Introduction of [C4MIM].Ac accelerated the biotransformation process, giving 99% yield,> 99% product e.e. and 1.42-fold higher initial reaction rate in conversion of 10 mM 2-octanone as substrate, compared with 99% yield, 97.3% product e. e. and 1.57 mu mol min(-1) of initial reaction rate in a aqueous single phase buffer system containing 6 mM 2-octanone as the optimal substrate concentration. Moreover, in the [C4MIM].Ac-containing buffer/n-tetradecane biphasic system, the optimal substrate concentration was enhanced by 83 times (500 mM) in comparison with that in aqueous single phase buffer, resulting in 53.4% yield (267 mM), 99% product e. e. with 8.9 mM g(-1) h(-1) space time yield.

AB Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia affecting 1-2% of the general population. Some common variants located in or next to PITX2 and NEURL1 genes are proved to play role in the occurrence of AF. The aim of our study was to investigate whether rs2595104 in the 4q25 chromosome region and rs6584555 SNP in the NEURL1 gene on chromosome 10 is associated with AF in a Caucasian population. We genotyped DNA samples of 76 AF patients and 77 healthy controls using quantitative real-time PCR followed by melting curve analysis. The minor A allele frequency of rs2595104 in PITX2 was 0.38 and 0.44 in the control group and in AF patients, respectively. There was no significant difference in allele and genotype distribution between the two groups (p = 0.52). The allele frequency based log additive odds ratio is 1.22 (C.I. = 0.76-1.94; p = 0.42). The frequency of minor rs6584555 C allele in NEURL1 was 0.22 in the control group and 0.23 in AF patients. Again there were no significant differences in allele and genotype frequencies between AF patients and controls (p = 0.92). The log additive odds ratio is 1,15 (C.I. = 0.66-2.01; p = 0,63). The heterozygous genotype of rs2595104 had the highest frequency compared to the other genotypes in both groups. In case of the rs6584555 SNP the homozygous genotype of the major allele (TT) had the highest frequency in both groups (0.59). The frequency of homozygous genotype for risk allele had the lowest frequency for both SNPs [rs2595104 (AA): 0.19 in patients, 0.12 in controls; rs6584555 (CC): 0.05 in patients, 0.03 in controls]. We did not find significant association between SNP rs2595104 and rs6584555 and AF. We performed a protein-protein network analysis to assess functional connection among the protein products. The proteins coded by PITX2 and NEURL1 are connected indirectly via CTNNB1 and either JAG1 or DLL4 proteins. These interactive proteins are components of two major channels of cell communication pathways, the Wnt and Notch signaling pathways.

AB The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins comprise the second largest superfamily of transcription factor that mediate various biochemical, physiological, and developmental processes in plants. The biological roles of these TFs are unknown, particularly in tomato. In this study, we isolated the tomato SlbHLH22 expressing significantly in fruits at early and later stages of development. The SlbHLH22 was overexpressed under control of CaMV 35S promoter. The transgenic tomato fruits exhibited sensitivity to exogenous phytohormone, such as ABA and IAA and ripened fast than WT fruits. However, the fruits remain insensitive to GA. It was observed that the transcript abundance of ABA and IAA related genes were also significantly upregulated in fruits overexpressing SlbHLH22. Compared to WT, the activities of peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase was lower in the transgenic fruits, while the MDA concentration was higher than in WT fruits. Similarly, the induced expressions of cell wall metabolism related genes (SlEXP1, SlLoxA, SlMAN, SlPE, and SlXTH5) were also observed in transgenic fruits. These results demonstrate that tomato SlbHLH22 expressions were regulated by phytohormones and identification of SlbHLH22 roles in post-harvest helps limit losses during handling, storage, and transportation.

AB Bacillus amyloliquefaciens spores have been used as the principal ingredient of biocontrol products. However, during the process of spore production, wild-type strains produce poly-gamma-glutamic acid (gamma-PGA), an undesirable byproduct that increases broth viscosity and hinders recovery and drying. This work examined the influence of specific glucose uptake rates (q(Gluc)) in glucose-controlled overflow metabolism. Diverse scenarios, from glucose limitation to glucose sufficiency, were evaluated in continuous cultures to control qGluc. Cell yields of glucose were higher at low qGluc, while the opposing trend was found for gamma-PGA and other overflow metabolic byproducts yields. However, gamma-PGA production was still detectable in cultures with the highest glucose limitation (D = 0.06 h(-1)), even though high sporulation incidence was observed in these cultures. Indeed, in such conditions, nonsporulating vegetative cells seem to maintain glucose overflow metabolism, allowing limited gamma-PGA production. These findings can be used to establish fed-batch culture strategies for high cell density Bacillus amyloliquefaciens cultures where gamma-PGA production (and apparent viscosity) is significantly reduced. This is the first time that the dependence of qGluc on growth, sporulation and carbon overflow metabolism of a spore and biofilm producer, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain, has been reported.

AB Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number changes have been associated with various diseases. Several studies showed that mtDNA content in peripheral blood was associated with oxidative stress and cardiovascular disease. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the severe cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to determine the mtDNA copy numbers in peripheral blood, in cell-free plasma and in exosomes of AF patients and healthy controls.
   Peripheral blood was drawn from 60 AF patients and 72 healthy controls. DNA was isolated from EDTA blood and plasma. Exosomes were isolated from cell-free plasma and then exosome encapsulated DNA (exoDNA) was extracted. Quantitative-real-time PCR was performed with Human Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) Monitoring Primer Set. Statistical analysis of the data was performed.
   We found statistically significant difference in mtDNA copy numbers in DNA isolated from peripheral whole blood, cell-free plasma and exosome samples of controls' (44.4 +/- 18.0, 27.2 +/- 30.1, 11.5 +/- 8.7), and patients' group (43.4 +/- 13.6, 26.2 +/- 26.4, 14.5 +/- 12.3). However there was no significant difference in mtDNA copy number between the two study groups either in peripheral blood, in cell-free plasma and in exosomes, and even in different sexes and ages.
   We found the highest copy number of mtDNA in peripheral blood, followed by plasma and exosomes. We did not find differences between patients and controls, neither age nor gender had effect on the mtDNA copy number. According to our results the mtDNA copy numbers did not differ in AF patients.

ID READ ALIGNMENT
AB Low-coverage massively parallel genome sequencing for non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) of common aneuploidies is one of the most rapidly adopted and relatively low-cost DNA tests. Since aggregation of reads from a large number of samples allows overcoming the problems of extremely low coverage of individual samples, we describe the possible re-use of the data generated during NIPT testing for genome scale population specific frequency determination of small DNA variants, requiring no additional costs except of those for the NIPT test itself. We applied our method to a data set comprising of 1501 original NIPT test results and evaluated the findings on different levels, from in silico population frequency comparisons up to wet lab validation analyses using a gold-standard method based on Sanger sequencing. The revealed high reliability of variant calling and allelic frequency determinations suggest that these NIPT data could serve as valuable alternatives to large scale population studies even for smaller countries around the world.

AB Glucosinolates can be hydrolyzed by the enzyme commonly known as myrosinase (E.C. 3.2.1.147) to a variety of biological compounds. Myrosinase (MYR) has been immobilized through the flexible spacers of different length on cross-linked chitosan resin (CCR). Ethylene diamine, hexamethylenediamine and decamethylene-diamine have been separately used as spacers. The influence of the flexible spacer length on the immobilized MYR (IMYR) properties were evaluated. The optimum pH and V-max of IMYR linearly increase with the flexible spacer length, and the optimum temperature and K-m of IMYR show an opposite trend. The recyclability of IMYR was good, with 90% recovery of activity after 10 cycles and 80% recovery after 30 cycles. IMYR was highly stable under storage conditions, with 95% recovery of activity after one year storage at 4 degrees C. The IMYR with the longest flexible spacer, decamethylene-diamine, was used as a biocatalyst for sulforaphene production. The overall hydrolysis ratio of glucoraphenin was 93.25 +/- 0.91% and the activity of DDMCCR-IMYR remained 95% after 10 days of continuous use.

AB Congenital heart diseases (CHDs) are the most common birth defects among life births, which could be presented as isolated or syndromic with other congenital malformations. The etiology of CHD largely unknown, genetic and environmental factors contribute to the disease. Recurrent copy number variants (CNVs) have been reported in the pathogenesis of CHD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and microarray analyses on isolated and syndromic CHD cases and to explore the relationship between identified CNVs and CHD. Eighteen prenatal samples, 16 isolated and 33 syndromic patients with mild to severe CHD phenotype were tested. Prenatal and isolated CHD cases did not show pathogenic CNVs. Clinically significant CNVs were detected in 7/33 (21%) syndromic CHD patients: del 22q11.2 (n = 2), 8p23.1 duplication (n = 2), deletion 5p (n = 1), deletion 6q21q22 (n = 1), unbalanced translocation causing partial deletion of 4q34.3 and duplication of 6q25.1 (n = 1). These genomic imbalances contain genes that has been associated with human CHD before. The present study demonstrates that using microarray and MLPA analysis increase the detection rate of causal CNVs in individuals with syndromic CHD.

AB The knowledge that the immune system is composed of a regulatory/suppressor arm added a new point of view to better understand the nature of several pathologies including cancer, transplants, infections and autoimmune diseases. The striking discoveries concerning molecules and cells involved in this kind of regulation were followed by the elucidation of equally notable mechanisms used by several pathogens to manipulate the host immune system. Vaccines against pathogens are an invaluable tool developed to help the immune system cope with a potential infection or prevent disease pathology. Nowadays, there is accumulated evidence indicating that the powerful stimulation capacity of vaccines influences not only the effector arm of the immune system but also cells with regulatory/suppressor capacity, such as myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs).
   Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) is a protozoan parasite with a complex life cycle that has evolved several strategies to influence the regulatory immune response. Although diverse vaccine formulations have been able to stimulate the effector response, achieving non-sterilizing protection against T. cruzi, the influence of the vaccine candidates on the regulatory machinery has scarcely been assessed. This fact may not only reveal important information concerning how vaccines may influence cells with regulatory/suppressor capacity but also open the possibility to analyze whether vaccines are able to disrupt the mechanisms used by some pathogens to manipulate the host regulatory circuits. The aim of this review is to summarize and discuss available data related to the role of cellular components, like MDSCs and Foxp3+ Tregs, during T. cruzi infection, and the potential utility of those populations as additional targets for the rational design of vaccines.

AB Adjuvants are chemical/biological substances that are used in vaccines to increase the immunogenicity of antigens. A few adjuvants have been developed for use in human vaccines because of their limitations including lack of efficacy, unacceptable local or systemic toxicity, the difficulty of manufacturing, poor stability, and high cost. For that reasons, novel adjuvants/adjuvant systems are under search. Astragaloside VII (AST-VII), isolated from Astragalus trojanus, exhibited significant cellular and humoral immune responses. The polysaccharides (APS) obtained from the roots of Astragalus species have been used in traditional Chinese medicine and possess strong immunomodulatory properties. In the present study, the immunomodulatory effects of a newly developed nanocarrier system (APNS: APS containing carrier) and its AST-VII containing formulation (ANS: AST-VII + APNS), on seasonal influenza A (H3N2) vaccine were investigated. Inactivated H3N2 alone or its combinations with test compounds/formulations were intramuscularly injected into Swiss albino mice. Four weeks after immunization, the immune responses were evaluated in terms of antibody and cytokine responses as well as splenocyte proliferation. APNS demonstrated Th2 mediated response by increasing IgG1 antibody titers, whereas ANS showed response towards Th1/Th2 balance and Th17 by producing of IFN-gamma, IL-17A and IgG2a. Based on these results, we propose that APNS and ANS are good candidates to be utilized in seasonal influenza A vaccines as adjuvants/carrier systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs) are multidisciplinary national experts who provide independent, evidence-informed vaccine policy recommendations to national health authorities. An essential NITAG function is to ensure that these decisions are grounded in the best available evidence generated through a systematic, transparent process. However, in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), experience with this decision making method is limited. The Task Force for Global Health manages the Partnership for Influenza Vaccine Introduction (PIVI) program in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ministries of Health, corporate partners and others. During 2017, PIVI worked with its country partners and the World Health Organization regional and local offices to assess NITAG strengthening needs and to provide technical assistance in 7 LMIC countries (Laos Peoples Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Vietnam, Armenia, Cote d'Ivoire; Moldova and the Republic of Georgia). Our workshops supported general NITAG capacity building and the evidence-based review process using vaccines of interest to the country. For NITAGs reviewing evidence on seasonal influenza, we developed an influenza resource package to support their review and provide country-relevant information in an easy to use format. Of the seven NITAGs trained, six have applied some of the concepts learnt: revision or development of formal transparent, systematic procedures for their operations; preparation of recommendations on seasonal influenza vaccination using quality-assessed data from systematic searches and local data; and have applied the principles learned for making other new vaccine recommendations. Our experience confirms that LMIC NITAGs are considerably under-resourced without adequate technical support or access to global peer-reviewed literature. Ongoing support from NITAG partners must be secured and creative approaches might be needed to help countries achieve the GVAP 2020 target and support development of sustainable vaccine policies and programs.

ID ADVISORY-COMMITTEE; RECOMMENDATIONS; PERTUSSIS
AB The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends antepartum Tdap vaccination for women with each pregnancy to protect themselves and their vulnerable infants through transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies. Our aim was to increase the rate of antepartum Tdap vaccine administration by 20%. Obstetricians were surveyed to identify their present approaches and barriers to antepartum Tdap vaccine administration to help guide the development of our intervention. Limited staff training, lack of vaccine on site, and cost were the most commonly identified barriers. Using these survey responses, existing literature, and brainstorming conversations with colleagues, an interdisciplinary workgroup then created a fishbone analysis and developed a 5-step intervention to address these barriers: (1) educate providers and patients on Tdap and pertussis; (2) increase Tdap availability to all pregnant women; (3) remind staff of the established Tdap standing order to facilitate administration; (4) encourage obstetricians to offer Tdap; (5) transfer documentation of Tdap administration from office to hospital. To monitor changes in the process over 15 months of pre- and post-intervention, data were collected from monthly chart audits and a two-phase control chart was created. The main outcome measure was proportion of eligible women who received Tdap during current pregnancy. In the pre-intervention period, 362 of 636 eligible women (56.9%) received Tdap during their current pregnancy; in the post-intervention period, 457 of 708 eligible women (64.5%) received Tdap during their current pregnancy. This absolute difference of 7.6% (64.5% vs. 56.9%, p < 0.01) represents a 13.4% relative increase (64.5%/56.9%) in the proportion of clinically eligible pregnant women who received Tdap. This represents a clinically and statistically significant increase in the rate of antepartum Tdap immunization. More research is needed to further understand obstetric barriers and maternal refusal of antepartum Tdap administration. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mucosal, but not peripheral, vaccination with whole Leishmania amazonensis antigen (LaAg) effectively protects mice against leishmaniasis, likely through a tolerogenic mechanism. Given the crucial role of retinoic acid (RA) in CD4(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T cell (T-reg) differentiation and mucosal tolerance, here we evaluated the capacity of RA to improve intranasal (i.n.) vaccination with LaAg. To prevent degradation and possible mucosa irritation, RA was encapsulated in solid lipid nanoparticles (RA-SLN). Thus, BALB/c mice were given two i.n. doses of LaAg alone or in association with RA-SLN (LaAg/RA-SLN) prior to challenge with L. amazonensis. No histological sign of irritation or inflammation was produced in the nasal mucosa after RA-SLN administration. LaAg/RA-SLN vaccine was more effective in delaying lesion growth and reducing parasite burdens than LaAg alone (96% and 61% reduction, respectively). At two months after challenge, both vaccinated groups displayed similar T helper (Th) 1-skewed in situ cytokine responses, different from early infection where both Th1 and Th2 responses were suppressed, except for transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta mRNA, that was higher in mice given RA-SLN. At the mucosa, RA-SLN promoted enhanced expression of interleukin (IL)-10 and CD4(+) Foxp3(+) T-reg population. In sum, these data show that RA-SLN is an effective and safe tolerogenic adjuvant for i.n. vaccination against leishmaniasis. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: In response to a cholera outbreak among mobile, difficult-to-reach fishermen on Lake Chilwa, Malawi in 2016, a novel vaccine distribution strategy exploited the proven vaccine thermostability. Fishermen, while taking the first vaccine dose under supervision, received the second dose in a sealed bag, and were told to drink it two weeks later. This study assessed short-term vaccine protection of this strategy.
   Methods: Patients with diarrhoea admitted to health facilities around lake were interviewed and a stool sample collected for PCR testing. Vaccine effectiveness was assessed in a case-control test-negative design by comparing cases (PCR-positive for V. cholerae O1) and controls (patients with diarrhoea but PCR-negative) and with the screening method that compared the proportions of vaccinated among cholera cases versus the general fishermen population.
   Results: Of 145 study participants, 120 were fishermen living on the lake. Vaccine effectiveness at three-months was 90.0% [95% CI: 38.8; 98.4] among fishermen and 83.3% [95% CI: 20.8; 96.5] among all participants in the case-control test-negative design, and 97.5% [95% CI: 90.9; 99.3] with the screening method.
   Conclusion: This strategy was effective in providing short-term protection in fishermen against cholera. Further research is needed to determine the adding value of the second dose and to identify the optimal vaccination strategies for different contexts. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Individuals suffering from severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) are immunocompromised and therefore highly susceptible to various infections including Haemophilus influenzae type a (Hia), an emerging pathogen in North American Indigenous populations. Immunocompromised Indigenous adults are considered a target for a new Hia vaccine under development. In an attempt to foresee their response to Hia immunization, we studied natural immunity against Hia and B-cell subpopulations in sixty patients with CKD residing in a geographic region with noticeable presence of Hia invasive disease. Serum bactericidal activity (SBA) against Hia, concentrations of IgG and IgM antibodies specific to Hia capsular polysaccharide, and B-cell subpopulations were studied in patients with CKD and 35 healthy controls of the same age. Of the patients with CKD, proportions and absolute numbers of B-cell subpopulations were determined for 28 patients. The patients had lower SBA titres compared to controls. Although no significant differences in anti-Hia IgG or IgM antibody concentrations between control and CKD groups were found, IgM antibody concentrations were higher in Indigenous than non-Indigenous patients. Patients with CKD had a higher proportion of B cells (CD19+), class switched memory B cells (CD19+CD27+IgM-) and a lower proportion of CD19+CD27-IgM- B cells compared to healthy controls. Non-Indigenous patients with CKD had significantly higher proportions of IgM memory B cells and CD19+CD27-IgM- B cells compared to Indigenous patients with no significant difference in absolute numbers. Because 72% of CKD patients had detectable SBA titres and 100% had detectable IgG and IgM antibodies it is possible that a portion of IgM memory B cells and class switched memory B cells are specific for Hia resulting from a natural exposure to the pathogen. The data suggest that a Hia-conjugate vaccine may be immunogenic in adult patients with CKD as it will potentially induce re-activation of immunological memory against Hia. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Biological therapy options for the treatment of rheumatic disease target molecules that can affect the cross-talk between innate and adaptive immune responses upon vaccination. Influenza vaccination in children with rheumatic disease has been recommended, but there are only sparse data on the quality of vaccine responses from pediatric patients treated with biological therapy.
   We conducted an influenza vaccine study over 3 consecutive seasons where the antibody response to TIV was evaluated in children with PRD (n = 78), including both non-treated (n = 17) and treated (with methotrexate, TNF-inhibitors with or without methotrexate, or IL-inhibitors, n = 61) children as well as healthy age-matched controls (n = 24). Peripheral B cells, T and NK cell populations, as well as CXCR5+ (follicular) helper T cells (T-FH) and chemokines involved in antibody responses were assessed prior to immunization in the same cohort. Data on disease duration, therapy and data on previous influenza vaccinations were retrieved.
   The proportion of circulating T-FH cells were significantly lower in non-treated children with PRD compared to treated patients and healthy controls. The significantly lower proportion of T-FH cells was mirrored by a marked significant increase in CXCL13 serum level, the ligand for CXCR5, with higher levels in non-treated children with PRD compared to treated patients and healthy controls. However, the proportion of T-FH cells or CXCL13 level at the time of vaccination was not a predictor of the antibody response to TIV in this cohort of children. Children with PRD had an overall similar response to TIV as healthy children. Although not significant, children treated with TNF-inhibitors differed as a few children remained seronegative towards H3N2- and influenza B viruses after immunization.
   Our data show that children with PRD respond to TIV as healthy children. Furthermore, plasma CXCL13 levels did not correlate to the proportion of T-FH cells in blood prior to immunisation, or to antibody responses following immunization. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI "This is a Pakhtun disease": Pakhtun health journalists' perceptions of
   the barriers and facilitators to polio vaccine acceptance among the
   high-risk Pakhtun community in Pakistan
SO VACCINE

   acceptance; Vaccine hesitancy, vaccination campaigns

AB Introduction: Pakistan is one of only three poliomyelitis-endemic countries in the world. Twelve wild poliovirus (WPV) cases were recorded in the country in 2018. Even though resistance to oral polio vaccine (OPV) has decreased over time, there are still pockets of communities, mostly ethnic Pakhtun living in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, that resist OPV. Although local journalists may be important sources of health information, past studies have overlooked their role in this context. The purpose of this study was to examine Pakhtun health journalists' beliefs regarding OPV and their views of the barriers and facilitators that influence OPV acceptance or hesitancy in their communities.
   Methods: We recruited and interviewed 33 Pakhtun journalists covering health issues for diverse media outlets in high-risk districts for WPV of the KP province. The semi-structured interviews were translated, transcribed, and analyzed for themes.
   Results: The participants strongly supported OPV and advocated that children in their own families and communities get vaccinated against polio. At the same time, they felt that their communities faced more urgent health needs that were not addressed by the government. They identified barriers at the media organizational level operating against accurate coverage of OPV, including financial and time constraints, a lack of checks and balances, and limited health literacy. They regarded press releases issued by the officials associated with OPV campaigns as the main facilitators in the coverage of OPV. The participants perceived lack of community trust in the government, security concerns, and community members' religious beliefs as the major impediments to increase in uptake of OPV.
   Conclusion: Pakhtun health journalists have the potential to be important partners in national polio eradication initiatives. They should receive culturally sensitive training in local languages at appropriate literacy levels. We also suggest direct involvement of journalists in community mobilization efforts.

TI Economic value of a therapeutic Chagas vaccine for indeterminate and

SO VACCINE
LA English

   PREDICTORS; BURDEN
AB Background: Therapeutic vaccines to prevent Chagas disease progression to cardiomyopathy are under development because the only available medications (benznidazole and nifurtimox) are limited by their efficacy, long treatment course, and side effects. Better understanding the potential clinical and economic value of such vaccines can help guide development and implementation.
   Methods: We developed a computational Chagas Markov model to evaluate the clinical and economic value of a therapeutic vaccine given in conjunction with benznidazole in indeterminate and chronic Chagas patients. Scenarios explored the vaccine's impact on reducing drug treatment dosage, duration, and adverse events, and risk of disease progression.
   Results: When administering standard-of-care benznidazole to 1000 indeterminate patients, 148 discontinued treatment and 219 progressed to chronic disease, resulting in 119 Chagas-related deaths and 2293 DALYs, costing $18.9 million in lifetime societal costs. Compared to benznidazole-only, therapeutic vaccination administered with benznidazole (25-75% reduction in standard dose and duration), resulted in 37-111 more patients (of 1000) completing treatment, preventing 11-219 patients from progressing, 6-120 deaths, and 108-2229 DALYs (5-100% progression risk reduction), saving <=$16,171 per patient. When vaccinating determinate Kuschnir class 1 Chagas patients, 10-197 fewer patients further progressed compared to benznidazole-only, averting 11-228 deaths and 144-3037 DALYs (5-100% progression risk reduction), saving <=$34,059 per person. When vaccinating Kuschnir class 2 patients, 13-279 fewer progressed (279 with benznidazole-only), averting 13-692 deaths and 283-10,785 DALYs (5-100% progression risk reduction), saving <=$89,759. Therapeutic vaccination was dominant (saved costs and provided health benefits) with >= 5% progression risk reduction, except when only reducing drug treatment regimen and adverse events, but remained cost-effective when costing <$200.
   Conclusions: Our study helps outline the thresholds at which a therapeutic Chagas vaccine may be costeffective (e.g., <5% reduction in preventing cardiac progression, 25% reduction in benznidazole treatment doses and duration) and cost-saving (e.g., >= 5% and 25%, respectively).

AB Background: Several studies have shown differences in susceptibility to infections and immune response to vaccines by sex. Prematurely born infants are at higher risk for pneumococcal diseases, with lower effectiveness for some vaccines compared to term infants. We have reported the effectiveness of the 10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV10) on several endpoints in the Finnish Invasive Pneumococcal disease (FinIP) vaccine trial. Now, we present the results of a post-hoc analysis evaluating PHiD-CV10 effectiveness in subgroups by sex, gestational age, and birth weight.
   Methods: The FinIP trial was a phase III/IV cluster-randomized, double-blind trial. Infants enrolled < 7 - months of age received PHiD-CV10 in two thirds of clusters (3 + 1 or 2 + 1 schedule) and hepatitis B vaccine as control in remaining third. Outcome data included invasive pneumococcal disease, pneumonia, tympanostomy tube placements, and antimicrobial purchases collected through national, routinely used health registers. Negative binomial model was used in the incidence and vaccine effectiveness estimation, and differences in incidences between subgroups were tested among control children.
   Results: Of the 30,527 infants enrolled 51% were boys. The incidences of hospital-diagnosed pneumonia and otitis-related outcomes were higher among boys in control groups. There were no significant sex differences in the vaccine effectiveness estimates.
   Altogether, 1519 (5%) infants were born before 37th gestational week. The incidences of pneumonia outcomes were higher among premature infants when compared to term infants.
   The vaccine effectiveness estimates among preterm infants were not statistically significant except for antimicrobial purchases, but all point estimates were at the same level among preterm infants as among term infants. There was no significant difference between 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 schedules in any of the subgroups analysed.
   Conclusion: PHiD-CV10 had a similar effectiveness in both sexes, and seemed to be protective in preterm infants. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Traditional inactivated influenza vaccines are the type of vaccines that were most frequently developed for immunization against the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus. However, clinical trials with inactivated influenza vaccines for H5N1 indicated that high doses and at least two immunizations are required for an effective immune response (Nicholson et al., 2001; Treanor, Campbell et al., 2006; Treanor, Schiff et al., 2006; Ehrlich et al., 2008). We investigated the safety and immunogenicity of a live attenuated H5N1 vaccine (delNS1-H5N1) lacking the interferon antagonist nonstructural protein 1 (NS1).
   Methods: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 study in healthy adult participants who were randomly assigned at a 2:1 ratio to receive two immunizations of delNS1-H5N1 vaccine at 6.8 log10 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50)/subject or 7.5 log10 TCID50/subject, or placebo.
   Results: Intranasal vaccination with the live attenuated delNS1-H5N1 vaccine was safe and well tolerated. The most common adverse events identified were symptoms associated with mild influenza infections, such as increased body temperature (>37.0 degrees C), pharyngeal erythema, rhinitis and throat irritation, and were reported within 7 days after the first immunization. delNS1-H5N1 was able to induce significant vaccine specific serum antibody titers even at the lower dose level of 6.8 log10 TCID50/subject. Seroconversion occurred in 75% of study participants after only one immunization with 7.5 log10 TCID50/subject. Vaccine-specific local IgA responses were observed in 41.7% of individuals that showed serum antibody responses after 2nd immunization.
   Conclusions: We show that vaccination with a live attenuated H5N1 influenza vaccine lacking NS1 is safe and induces significant levels of vaccine-specific antibodies even after one immunization. The safety and immunogenicity data indicate that delNS1-H5N1 has the potential to fulfil the unmet need for an effective influenza vaccine in pandemic situations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: The administration of an extra dose of a vaccine may occur due to a programmatic error (e.g., vaccination error) when there is need to provide one of the antigens of a combination vaccine not readily available as a single antigen, or when there is need to provide immunization in a person with uncertain vaccination histories (e.g., refugees). There is little data available on the safety of an extra dose of vaccine.
   Objective: To assess for the presence of adverse events (AEs) most commonly reported following the administration of excess doses of vaccine in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).
   Methods: We searched VAERS for US reports where an excess dose of vaccine was administered to a person received from 1/1/2007 through 1/26/2018. We reviewed medical records for all serious reports and a random sample of non-serious reports. The most common AEs among reports of excess dose of vaccine administered were compared with the corresponding AEs for all vaccines reported to VAERS during the same period.
   Results: Out of 366,815 total VAERS reports received, 5067 (1.4%) reported an excess dose of vaccine was administered; 3898 (76.9%) did not describe an adverse health event (AHE). The most common vaccines reported were trivalent inactivated influenza (15.4%), varicella (13.9%), hepatitis A (11.4%), and measles, mumps, rubella, varicella (11.1%). Among reports where only AHEs were reported, the most common were pyrexia (12.8%), injection site erythema (9.7%), injection site pain (8.9%), and headache (6.6%). The percentage of AHEs among these reports was comparable to all reports submitted to VAERS during the same study period.
   Conclusion: More than three-fourths of reports of an excess dose of vaccine did not describe an AHE. Among reports where an AHE event was reported, we did not observe any unexpected conditions or clustering of AEs. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine (BCG), one of the most widely used vaccines, does not only provide protection against tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections, but also has nonspecific (heterologous) immunomodulatory effects. In participants in a randomised trial, we investigated the effect of neonatal BCG immunisation on antibody responses to routine infant vaccines given in the first year of life.
   Methods: Antibodies against antigens in the diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines were measured in 91 (45 BCG-vaccinated, 46 BCG-naive) infants one month after, and in 310 (169 BCG-vaccinated, 141 BCG-naive) infants seven months after immunisation at 6 weeks, 4 and 6 months of age. In addition, antibodies against meningococcus C, Hib, measles, mumps, and rubella were measured in 147 (78 BCG-vaccinated, 69 BCG-naive) infants one month after immunisation at 12 months of age. The seroprotection rates for each vaccine and the geometric mean concentrations (GMC) of antibodies were compared in BCG-vaccinated and BCG-naive infants.
   Results: At 7 months of age, seroprotection rates were high in both BCG-vaccinated and BCG-naive infants. At 13 months of age, seroprotection rates were lower than at 7 months of age, particularly for pertussis and a number of pneumococcal antigens, with generally higher rates for the latter in BCG-vaccinated infants. Although not statistically significant, antibody responses in BCG-vaccinated infants were consistently higher against diphtheria, tetanus, and pneumococcal antigens at both 7 and 13 months of age, and against measles and mumps at 13 months of age, but were lower against Hib one month after immunisation at both 7 and 13 months of age.
   Conclusion: The immunomodulatory effect of BCG on antibody responses to heterologous vaccines adds to the evidence that BCG immunisation at birth has broad heterologous effects on the infant immune system. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Taibai ductile shear zone affecting the northern margin of the Taibai granitic pluton which emplaced in the North Qinling Orogenic Belt, is crucial to understand the amalgamation and post-collision history between the North China Block and the South China Block. The shear sense indicators and the kinematic vorticity numbers (0.42-0.59) suggest that the Taibai shear zone is an elongating general shear zone involving both sinistral shear and pure shear components. The quartz lattice preferred orientations mainly indicate the activation of prism <a> slip system combined with rhomb <a> slip to prism <a> slip system. The dynamic recrystallization of quartz is accommodated by sub-grain rotation and bulging recrystallization while plagioclase mainly displays bulging recrystallization. These characteristics suggest that the mylonites have experienced ductile shear deformation under greenschist facies conditions at temperatures of similar to 400-550 degrees C. Zircons from granitic mylonite yield upper and lower intercept ages of 425 +/- 4 Ma and 144 +/- 1 Ma, respectively, suggesting the protolith of the mylonite crystallized at ca. 425 Ma and was involved into a hydrothermal activity at ca. 144 Ma. Muscovite Ar-40/Ar-39 dating of the mylonite sample yield a plateau age of 346 +/- 5 Ma and an inverse isochron age of 344 +/- 4 Ma, constraining the ductile shear deformation occurring during the Early Carboniferous time. We suggest that the Taibai shear zone was formed by NE-SW oblique compression with top-to-the-NW shear sense during the Early Carboniferous time, following the N-S shortening caused by collision between the North China Block and South China Block along the Shangdan suture at ca. 400 Ma.

AB High-Mg# (molar Mg/[Mg + Fe]) intermediate to felsic rocks, such as high-Mg andesitic rocks (HMA) and Mg andesites (MA), are usually produced by melting of mantle-derived peridotites and/or interaction with mantle-derived peridotites. Both are crucial in tracking mantle-crust interaction processes in the deep crust. We present LA-ICP-MS in-situ zircon U-Pb isotopic data, whole-rock geochemistry and whole-rock Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic data for the Basu granodiorites which are exposed between the Jiali fault and the Bangong-Nujiang suture, SE Tibet. The LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb data show that the granodiorites were formed at ca. 122.1 +/- 1.0 Ma, coeval with other granitoids in this region. The granodiorites belong to the high-K talc-alkaline and high-Mg# (49.7-53.7) series, similar to typical MA. The decreasing A/CNK from 0.97 to 0.87 and increasing FM (molar Fe + Mg) from 0.08 to 0.16 indicate a clinopyroxene entrainment and I-type trend. The rocks also display enriched Rb, Th, U and Pb, but depleted P, Ti and obvious negative Eu anomalies. Evolved whole-rock isotopic compositions of Basu granodiorites include high initial Sr-87/Sr-86 (0.7097-0.7114), negative epsilon Nd(t) (-12.0 to -7.2) and epsilon Hf(t) values (-9.6 to -7.9), and lower to upper crustal affinity of Pb isotopes which imply that they were derived from an ancient and evolved lower crust source. Therefore, we suggest that these granodiorites were products of interaction between partial melting of ancient basaltic lower crust and mantle-derived peridotites. Together with a geochronology dataset from the literature, we suggest that there was intensive granitic magmatism occurred in the Early Cretaceous range from 133 to 113 Ma in the northeastern Lhasa tenrane, similar to those in the central and northern Lhasa terrane. Furthermore, we have compared with the dataset of in-situ zircon Lu-Hf isotopes, whole-rock Sr-Nd from the literatures and the relationship with zircon U-Pb ages in the northeastern Lhasa terrane, all of which indicate the importance of evolved and ancient continental crust source in the Early Cretaceous magmatism in the northeastern Lhasa terrane, but also that the mantle-derived materials play a necessary role in the generation. In addition, the amount of enriched and evolved isotopic component gradually decreased from ca.140 to 100 Ma.

AB The Yuanjiang marble-hosted ruby deposit in the middle Ailao Shan-Red River (ASRR) shear zone, is the only economic ruby deposit in China. This deposit is hosted in Paleoproterozoic sillimanite gneisses and the ores are found in metamorphosed platform carbonates. Rubies are unevenly distributed within calcite-rich marble layers and mainly associated with phlogopite, scapolite, graphite, pyrite. Rubies contain zircon, rutile, apatite, calcite inclusions. The genesis of the Yuanjiang ruby deposit and its genetic link to the ASRR shear zone remain poorly understood. In this contribution, its formation age has been indirectly constrained by the in-situ LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating of zircon inclusions in rubies and Ar-40/Ar-39 dating of syngenetic phlogopite from the ruby-phlogopite bearing marble, which yielded the ages of 36.2 +/- 1.1 Ma (MSWD = 1.4, 2 sigma, n = 4) and 22.2-22.5 Ma, respectively. The 36.2 Ma U-Pb age of metamorphic zircon inclusions falls within the range of local crustal thickening related subduction-collision and coupled with the spatial distribution in which ruby deposits were not restricted in the shear zone, we propose that ruby mineralization was triggered by the local continental subduction-collision rather than the large-scale left-lateral shearing. Due to the estimated closure temperature of the Ar-40/Ar-39 system is lower than the ore-forming temperature, the obtained phlogopite Ar-40/Ar-39 ages of 22.2-22.5 Ma represent the minimum ore-forming age of the Yuanjiang ruby deposit. These phlogopite ages reveal a slower cooling rate of ruby deposits within the shear zone (including the Yuanjiang and the Yen Bai ruby deposits) than outside of the shear zone (the Luc Yen deposit), which can be attributed to the additional heat from the left-lateral shearing movement. Therefore, we propose that the left-lateral shearing plays an important role in transporting marble-hosted ruby deposits in the Ailao Shan-Red River shear zone to the subsurface.

AB Within the Sanbagawa metamorphic belt, the timing of high-pressure and retrograde metamorphism is controversial. Recently, an area in the Asemi River region (central Shikoku, Japan) was delineated that had been subjected to ecologite fades metamorphism prior to retrograde metamorphism in the epidote-amphibolite facies which provides a new opportunity to constrain the age of high-pressure metamorphism. Detrital zircon from this area yields ages as young as 84 +/- 4 Ma. Hence, the protoliths were deposited not earlier than ca. 88 Ma and thus, eclogite facies and retrograde metamorphism occurred after 88 Ma, probably at 86-82 Ma as indicated by the age of metamorphic zircon and K-Ar and Ar-Ar ages for white mica.

AB In Central Asia, numerous fragments of planation surfaces are visible within the present day topography. However, their precise timing of formations is still poorly constrained and it is not clear if they are remnants of a single extensive planation surface or if they represent different planation episodes. By reconstructing the landscape evolution of the Tian Shan region and by analyzing the relations between the planation surfaces preserved within the eastern Tarim Basin and the sedimentary record, we demonstrate that the numerous erosional surfaces preserved within the Tian Shan Range represent different episodes of surfaces genesis. These erosion events span from the late Paleozoic to the Early Cenozoic. The widespread preservation of large fragments of these surfaces within the Tian Shan Range implies that this region did not undergo strong relief building during most of its Mesozoic evolution but was dominated by plains associated to small hills along episodically active discrete tectonic structures. Finally, the preservation of these surfaces within the active Tian Shan Range implies a long-term, strong non-equilibrium state of the topography during its Cenozoic evolution. This was probably promoted by the arid to semi-arid climate prevailing since the Late Paleogene onset of relief building.

AB Increasingly frequent earthquakes in the Longmenshan (LMS) tectonic belt are linked to the ongoing eastward growth of the Tibetan Plateau during the Late Cenozoic. Following the devastating 2008 Ms 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake in the central LMS and the 2013 Ms 7.0 Lushan earthquake in the southern segment, an unexpected Ms 5.4 Qingchuan earthquake occurred on September 30, 2017 in the northern LMS. We synthesize focal mechanism solutions, relocated aftershocks, regional geology, and seismic reflection profiles in order to determine the pre-existing faults and active fault system in the northern LMS, thus to better assess potential seismic hazards. At a seismically resolvable scale, we identify a large structural wedge at the basement that is cross-cut by numerous multiphase and multi-behavior active faults. Our seismotectonic model indicates that the seismogenic fault responsible for the 2017 Ms 5.4 Qingchuan earthquake is a pre-existing thrust fault with a dip of similar to 34 degrees in the frontal thrust ramp. Reactivation of this fault then triggered the activity of the co-seismic strike-slip fault that was formed in the 2008 Wenchuan event. The seismic interpretation, focal mechanism solutions, and aftershock distribution indicate that two sub-segment faults with different geometries are distinguished along the northern LMS. Accordingly, a transformation of the coseismic fault with different geometry and kinematics is formed. With the constraints that the mainshock and aftershocks occurred on two different faults, we propose that both the frontal ramp thrust fault and the recently-formed strike-slip fault are tectonically active. This study highlights the importance of the influence of the pre-existing fault system on the evolution of the northern LMS during the Late Cenozoic. The rapid uplift of the eastern Tibetan Plateau and the complex fault system indicate the potential for seismic risks in the northern LMS.

AB Potassium-rich lavas with K/Na of > 2 are common in orogenic and anorogenic intraplate magmatic provinces. However, in the primitive mantle, the concentration of Na exceeds that of K by 10 times. The source of K-rich lavas thus needs to be either K-enriched or Na-depleted to account for high K/Na ratios. The geochemical and isotopic compositions of high Sr-87/Sr-86 post-collisional lavas show that their mantle source contains a recycled crustal component. These highly K-enriched lavas with crustal like trace element patterns are termed "orogenic lamproites" and are compositionally distinct from K-rich "anorogenic lamproites" that show lower Sr-87/Sr-86 and a trace element pattern that resembles that of primary mantle melts. For both groups the processes of K-enrichment within their source are uncertain and are thought to be linked to melts of sedimentary rocks for "orogenic lamproites" and low-degree melts of ultramafic mantle rocks for "anorogenic lamproites". In both cases, metasomatism of the mantle lithosphere is the precursor to K-rich magmatism. In this study we experimentally determine the effects of mantle metasomatism by sediment- and hydrous mantle melts. The experiments simulate the interaction of refractory lithospheric mantle and metasomatizing melt in a 2-layer reaction experiment. The sediment/dunite reaction experiments lead to formation of a strongly K-enriched phlogopite pyroxenite layer sandwiched between the two starting materials. The low temperature of the sediment/dunite reaction runs at < 1000 degrees C simulates a fore-arc subduction environment, in which the melts of sediment are consumed during interaction with dunite as the temperature is below the solidus of the produced phlogopite pyroxenites. The hydrous mantle melt/dunite reaction run is simulated by reacting a hydrated basanite with dunite. Since the temperature of the reaction is higher than the solidus of the resulting phlogopite-pyroxenites (1200 degrees C), the hydrous melt is not consumed but flows further, increasing in K2O and K/Na as it reacts with the refractory peridotite. In both cases, melts are enriched in K and K/Na increases by crystallizing a low K and low K/Na eclogitic residue. Compositions of glass and phlogopite from both types of reactions are comparable to glasses and phlogopites found within post-collisional lavas. Since the enrichment of K within the reaction zone is strongly controlled by the formation of low K/Na and low-K residues, metasomatic enrichment of the mantle lithosphere in K does not need a highly K-enriched metasomatic agent.

AB Deep-water sandstones related to sediment gravity flows are becoming an increasingly important exploration domain in continental rift basins in China. However, ambiguities remain regarding the initiation, evolution, and deposition of sediment gravity flows on faulted slopes, where step faults are commonly developed. To address the uncertainties related to these processes, grain size analysis, lithofacies analysis, logging interpretation, and seismic interpretation were employed to study Paleogene sediment gravity flow deposits from well cores on a faulted slope in the Zhanhua Sag of the Bohai Bay Basin. Twelve lithofacies related to sediment gravity flows were recognized and attributed to intrabasinal sediment gravity flows (ISGFs) induced by slope failures and extrabasinal sediment gravity flows (ESGFs) generated by floods. Active faults were important triggers for ISGFs on the faulted slope in the Zhanhua Sag. The fault activity rate had a prominent role in determining the volume of re-transported sediments, which further influenced the evolution of the resulting flows. Travelling across multiple faults downslope, ISGFs generally underwent considerable velocity losses, with the result that almost all sediments were deposited in shallow water. Moreover, unconsolidated ISGF deposits could be transported again to generate sediment gravity flows, obscuring the depositional characteristics of ISGFs. ESGFs originated from rivers during floods and involved the transformation of cohesive into turbulent hyperpycnal flows. In humid and warm climates, active sag-border faults favoured the generation of long-lived ESGFs. These flows usually travelled along intra-sag faults and therefore considerable volume of sediments could be transferred into deep water. The resulting thick-bedded hyperpycnites contributed substantially to the reservoirs of Bonan Oilfield. Meanwhile, short-lived ESGFs usually generated in the regions where sag-border faults were extinct. They generally travelled down the faulted slope and deposited sediments in shallow water. These features suggest that the initiation, evolution, and deposition of sediment gravity flows on the faulted slope are mainly controlled by faults and climate. Hyperpycnites can serve as excellent reservoirs for hydrocarbon accumulation and they are probably common in other sags of the Bohai Bay Basin.

AB The Ms 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake occurred in the Longmenshan fault zone (LFZ) of the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The tectonic activities in this region have been a focus of extensive studies in the past two decades. Two different models involving oblique stepwise rise and channel flow, respectively, are proposed and can be used to explain the generation of earthquakes. The oblique stepwise rise model emphasizes more about the fault of the upper crust, whereas the channel flow model concerns more about the different crustal rheological structures. Currently, because of the confirmation of geophysical data on the rheological structure of the TP, more researchers agree with the channel flow model. To investigate the generation of earthquakes in the LFZ, this study establishes a three-dimensional viscoelastic model based on the heterogeneity of the lithospheric structure and the segmentation of faults. Using ANSYS finite element software to simulate the evolution of stress and strain, the calculated results are consistent with focal mechanism solutions, fault striations, and topography. The best-fit stress field suggests that stress localization in the Longmenshan range is mainly controlled by the channel flow and fault segmentation. The differing viscosities and relative movement between the channel flow and the Sichuan Basin induce a concentration of stress in the LFZ. The stress was most concentrated in segment II, closest to the leading edge of the channel flow, and wherein the Wenchuan earthquake occurred. Additionally, the higher locking degree of segment II found before the Wenchuan earthquake induced higher stress levels at shallow depths, corresponding to higher seismic activity in segment II. Thus, the combined action of the channel flow and fault segmentation controls the distribution of stress and causes the generation of earthquakes in the LFZ.

AB To elucidate continental rifting mechanism of the South China Sea (SCS), we characterize crustal structures of the two conjugate rifted margins and calibrate the continental-ocean transition zone (COT) with multi-channel reflection seismic, gravimetric and magnetic data. Narrower than those found in many other magma-poor margins, the COT in the SCS coincides well with a positive-negative gravity boundary, and shows Moho reflection gaps, basement highs and seaward normal faults. Post-rifting/spreading volcanic bodies and igneous intrusions often complicate the structures of the COT. Rifted basins here are often bounded by listric normal faults, the majority of which terminate at the upper-lower crust interface, i.e., the brittle-ductile transition boundary. This observation suggests that the lower crust was weak and played a dominant role in the continental breakup. We propose that the SCS lower crust acted as a decouple layer during extension, but the normal oceanic crust began to establish soon after crustal breakup. We also show how thermal regime affected the extent and timing of continental rifting of the SCS.

AB We propose that topography can be used as a proxy for the eastward lateral "glacier-like flow" of the Tibetan crust in the Himalayan-Tibetan orogenic system. Geodetic observations across the Tibetan plateau indicate similar to 22 mm/yr of crustal motion with respect to stable Eurasia by considering Newtonian channel flow model. Further, correlation between regional strain rate (e) and topographic elevation (h) is found to be statistically robust, with stress exponent (n) of 3.03 +/- 0.1. Therefore, we suggest that the Tibetan crust follows well defined power-law relation that is consistent with the nonlinear deformation associated with dislocation-creep. Moreover, the predicted viscosity range of the Tibetan crust is consistent with the channel flow model proposed by previous investigators using different approaches in different time scales.

AB Mt. Merapi, located in central Java, Indonesia, is one of the most active volcanoes in the world. It has been subjected to numerous studies using a variety of methods, including tomographic imaging, in an attempt to understand the structure and dynamics of its magmatic plumbing system. Results of previous seismic tomographic studies that include Mt. Merapi poorly constrain the location of its underlying magma source due to limited data coverage. In order to comprehensively understand the internal structure and magmatism of Mt. Merapi, a project called DOMERAPI was conducted, in which 53 broadband seismic stations were deployed around Mt. Merapi and its neighbourhood for approximately 18 months, from October 2013 to April 2015. In this study, we compare Vp, Vs, and Vp/Vs tomograms constructed using data obtained from local (DOMERAPI) and regional seismic networks with those obtained without DOMERAPI data. We demonstrate that the data from the DOMERAPI seismic network are crucial for resolving key features beneath the volcano, such as high Vp/Vs ratios beneath the Merapi summit at similar to 5 km and similar to 15 km depths, which we interpret as shallow and intermediate magma bodies, respectively. Furthermore, west-east vertical sections across Mt. Merapi, and a "dormant" (less active) volcano, Mt. Merbabu, exhibit high Vp/Vs and low Vp/Vs ratios, respectively, directly beneath their summits. This observation likely reflects the presence (for Mt. Merapi) and absence (for Mt. Merbabu) of shallow magma bodies near the surface.

ID SUMATRA-ANDAMAN EARTHQUAKE; FAULT; MODEL; SLIP
AB GPS data after the 2 July 2013 M-w 6.1 Aceh earthquake provide valuable information for understanding the postseismic behavior of a strike-slip fault in northern Sumatra, Indonesia. The analysis of postseismic deformation following the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and the 2012 Indian Ocean earthquake suggest that the ongoing deformation affected northern Sumatra between July and December 2013. The postseismic deformation of the 2013 Aceh earthquake is herein investigated, with the contribution of poroelastic rebound and viscoelastic relaxation evaluated. The results suggest that the model displacement of those two mechanisms failed to estimate the data. The afterslip analysis of the 2013 Aceh earthquake, on the contrary, fits the data very well with a seismic slip occurring at multiple fault segments of the Sumatran fault in northern Sumatra, Indonesia.

AB The Neoproterozoic tectonic evolution of South China is important for understanding the tectonic assembly of modern East Asia. As a key sedimentary-volcanic sequence, the Banxi Group in South China contains a wealth of information on the genesis of the Nanhua rift basin, which is linked to the assembly and breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent. However, the geochronological and tectonic signatures of the Benxi Group in the Jiangnan orogenic belt are still controversial. In this study, the tuffaceous rocks in the Banxi area were analyzed with regard to their whole-rock major- and trace-element concentrations, and zircons in the tuffaceous rocks were analyzed for LA-(MC)-ICPMS U-Pb ages, trace elements and Hf isotopic compositions. These rocks are well preserved and show high concentrations of SiO2 (61.7-72.3%), K2O (1.7-4.5%), Al2O3 (8.4-18.9%), Rb (55-195 ppm) and Th (4.3-12.4 ppm), low concentrations of TiO2 (0.24-0.95%), Sr (54-128 ppm), Nb (5.6-12.1 ppm) and Ta (0.4-0.9 ppm), LREE enrichment (La-N/Yb-N = 6.6-14.7), and negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 0.45-0.85). They have chemical affinities with high-K calc-alkaline S-type granites and exhibit continental volcanic-arc characteristics. The zircons are magmatic in origin and yield a U-Pb age distribution with three peaks: (1) Neoproterozoic (597-949 Ma, mostly 761-788 Ma), (2) Mesoproterozoic (1122-1387 Ma), and (3) Paleoproterozoic (1952-2605 Ma). The Neoproterozoic zircons yield slightly different, but overlapping, mean ages as a function of lithology: 770.2 +/- 3.7 Ma for tuffaceous siltstones, 768.2 +/- 6.7 Ma for tuffs, and 766.4 +/- 5.2 Ma for tuffaceous slates. All zircons in the study units exhibit high U/Yb ratios (0.1-0.6) and low Hf (7106-12554 ppm) and Y (305-6617 ppm) contents, suggesting continental crustal derivation. Some of the zircons have larger LREE contents and smaller Ce anomalies relative to typical magmatic zircons, suggesting later fluid modification. The Neoproterozoic zircons have epsilon Hf(t) values ranging from -16.5 to 16.7 (mostly -8 to 10), corresponding to crustal model ages (T-DM(C)) of 0.97-2.73 Ga. These ages imply a mixture of juvenile (i.e., Neoproterozoic) arc-derived material and Paleoproterozoic heterogeneous crust as magmatic sources for the tuffaceous sequences. Based on our integrated dataset, we infer that the Banxi tuffaceous rocks were extrusive equivalents of S-type granitoids that show volcanic-arc affinities but that were nonetheless deposited in a post-collisional and subsequent rifting-related extensional setting within the newly amalgamated South China Block. We account for this apparent contradiction by proposing that, following collision of the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks, a rapid breakup of the continental arc caused by deep mantle upwelling led to initiation of post-collisional extension and rifting in the Nanhua Basin.

AB The Cona-Oiga rift (COR) is the easternmost member of a series of similar to N-S trending Cenozoic rifts in the southern Tibetan Plateau. The Yarlung River flows from west to east, across the COR and exhibits diverse river morphology along strike. We analyze tributary fluvial longitudinal profiles in the Yarlung drainage and the published strain rate field on both sides of the rift in order to gain knowledge about its development and crustal deformation patterns within the plateau interior. Tributaries on the western side of the rift have relatively low normalized steepness index (k(sn)). Concave curves in chi-elevation plots and cross-divide contrasts in chi, mean relief, and mean gradient, indicate ongoing river reorganization in this region. In contrast, high topographic relief and steep stream channels developed on the eastern side. In addition, spatial variations in negative dilatational strain rates indicate diverse crustal shortening and regional uplift across the COR. We suggest that the Cona-Oiga rift plays an important role in accommodating deformation associated with the continuing indentation of the eastern Himalayan syntaxis. Tectonic forcing might be the dominant factor controlling landscape evolution across the COR.

AB The Ailaoshan-Red River shear zone (ASRR) in SE Tibet accommodated about 20% convergence of the Cenozoic India-Asia continental collision which resulted in complicated thermal history during Paleocene to Miocene. The Ailaoshan massif, in the middle part of ASRR, is characterized by extensive mylonitization and migmatization, but the exact timing of the large scale left lateral shearing and whether the crustal partial melting occurred prior to or coeval with the left lateral shearing remain controversial. The detailed structural observation suggests the pre-kinematic nature of the Ailaoshan corundum with respect to the left lateral shearing. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating of metamorphic zircon and monazite inclusions in the pre-kinematic Ailaoshan corundum obtained a weighted Pb-206-U-238 ages of 28.0 +/- 0.5 Ma (MSWD = 3.3; N = 27) and 28.3 +/- 0.3 Ma (MSWD = 1.8; N = 18), respectively, which gave an upper limit on the initiation of the left lateral shearing in the Ailaoshan massif. Moreover, the presence of protogenetic siliceous melt inclusions in the pre-kinematic corundum indicates that the Cenozoic crustal anatexis of the Ailaoshan massif has occurred before the left lateral shearing. Along with available geochronological data, the crustal partial melting of the Ailaoshan massif was attributed to joint results, which at least include the Neoproterozoic convergence, the Triassic Indosinian Orogeny, and the Cenozoic evolution as a response to the India-Asia continental collision.

TI SHRIMP U-Pb ages of zircons from mafic granulites of the Eastern Ghats

AB We determined SHRIMP U-Pb ages of zircons from three mafic granulite samples of the polymetamorphosed, multiply-deformed Kondapalli-Ongole domain of the Eastern Ghats Belt (EGB), SE India. Our goals are: (1) to evaluate the origin of zircons in the high-grade mafic granulites; and (2) to clarify the petrotectonic evolution of magmatic and metamorphic rocks along the SE margin of India. The zircons record three distinct Paleoproterozoic U-Pb age groups: igneous protoliths of the mafic granulites apparently crystallized at similar to 1715 Ma, and underwent granulite-facies high-temperature metamorphism at similar to 1676 Ma, with a subsequent fabric-defining gamet-granulite grade metamorphic overprint at similar to 1610 Ma. Based on textures, cathodoluminescence images, and geochemistry, we identified three zircon types among the similar to 1610 Ma zircons: Type I and II zircon grains recrystallized or newly grown in equilibrium with feldspar and garnet, respectively; Type III zircons crystallized from aqueous anatectic melt in quartzofeldspathic veins. Some zircons of all the three types show alteration effects. The similar to 1715 Ma event likely represents formation of the Kondapalli-Ongole magmatic arc crust, whereas the similar to 1610 Ma high-grade metamorphic event reflects suturing of the arc to proto-India and cratonization of the EGB. The interval between the formation of U-poor, low Th/Yb zircons (equilibrated with garnet) and U-rich, high Th/Yb zircons (equili-brated with fluid-rich melt) is geologically insignificant, suggesting that tectonic accretion of the EGB, its final suturing, and orogenic collapse took place rapidly.

AB This review outlines how SE Asian tectonic and stratigraphic studies could be more closely linked. Many tectonic papers on the region include comments on stratigraphic evidence, and stratigraphic papers often allude to tectonic events, but this paper highlights the benefits of a more detailed integration of the two fields of study into a single geological model, by using inductive sequence stratigraphic methods supported by geohistory plots. The South China Sea and North Borneo region has been traditionally been divided into Provinces, each with its own distinct stratigraphy. A handicap in merging all the Provinces into one geological model has been the inconsistent application of basic biostratigraphy, and some examples are given that illustrate that more careful documentation of a complex data set is required in future work.
   The inductive stratigraphic method requires increased analytical work to calibrate seismic data, but even on current data an episodic stratigraphic history is indicated, and a single tectono-stratigraphic framework for the whole region is emerging, with a greatly simplified and consistent terminology. This review examines the impact of these methods on one important period of transition around the Oligo-Miocene boundary.
   The summary given for the Oligo-Miocene transition questions the viability of the commonly cited slab-pull tectonic model, as both the historical order of geological events and geographic spread of effects does not fit that model as currently understood.

AB The Badain Jaran Desert in northern China is well known for the highest mega-dunes on Earth and unique alternating megadune-lake landform, and various formation mechanisms have been proposed. Although the relics of interdune lakes are generally considered as good palaeoenvironmental records, their evolutions and relevance to paleoenvironment change are poorly understood due to limited age control. In this study, quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and K-feldspar post-infrared infrared stimulated luminescence (pIRIR) were used to establish a chronological framework for limnic relics in order to reconstruct the evolution of interdune lakes. Our results indicate that limnic relics were deposited in MIS 5 and MIS 1, due to a lake level transgression and humid environmental condition. During the Holocene, humid conditions occurred at early to middle Holocene, immediately preceded and followed by aridity. The last 600 years have been characterized by high rates of aeolian activity. Based on field observation and luminescence ages, we propose that climate fluctuations since the Late Pleistocene have played a pivotal role in the formation of the unique landform assemblages.

AB Multiproxy records from Core MD06-3054 in the western Philippine Sea and published results from the nearby Core MD06-3052, which are both located at the northern margin of the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP), provide precise reconstructions and evidence for the potential controls on continental erosion and weathering intensities in Luzon. These data also constrain sediment source-to-sink processes in the sea since 27 ka at the millennial scale. We demonstrate that the siliciclastic fraction is derived from Luzon volcanic rocks and eolian dust from mainland Asia. Stronger physical erosion and chemical weathering generally occurred during the last glaciation, Heinrich Event 1, the Younger Dryas, and the period from 10.3 to 11.3 ka. In contrast, the Bolling-Allerod was characterized by weaker physical erosion and chemical weathering. During the last glaciation, Heinrich Event 1, and the Younger Dryas, the lower sea level led to enhanced erosion and weathering of the exposed shelf sediments. In contrast, the weaker physical erosion and chemical weathering that occurred during the Balling-Allerod and the Holocene, except after 2.1 ka, are closely correlated with the higher sea level. The stronger physical erosion and chemical weathering at 10.3-11.3 ka may be derived from the reworking of older sediments during the time of a strengthening summer monsoon. Furthermore, enhanced human activity since 2.1 ka has become the dominant control on erosion in Luzon. Rapid weathering changes in the WPWP during the last deglaciation highlight the high variability in local controls at low latitudes during these periods and the potential influence of controls at high latitudes.

AB The coasts around the South China Sea are highly populated and threatened by the ubiquitous tsunamigenic structures of the Manila trench-arc system. However, owing to limited historical records and rare geological findings of tsunamis, our comprehension of and preparation for regional tsunami risks are far from sufficient. Located in the NE South China Sea, the Penghu Islands in Taiwan's western offshore area are selected for a geological tsunami survey because of their advantages of lengthy coastlines and abundant upper Holocene deposits.
   Three gravel layers of marine incursion events were identified and correlated between three far-separated coastal sections based on the constraints of radiocarbon dating. Intercalated with talus, soil, and dune sand, the gravel layers are poorly sorted, matrix-supported, up to boulder in size, and dominated by marine bioclastics and rounded basalts, which are identical to modern beach gravels. The deposits are located 3-4 m above present sea level, which is significantly higher than the local high tide levels and maximal typhoon surges of 2-3 m high. Furthermore, the deposits are distributed extensively on south-facing shores, indicating relatively large and abnormal inundation events from the South China Sea.
   Based on the radiocarbon dating results of the event deposits, three tsunamis likely occurred in the periods from the 4th to 6th, 11th to 12th, and 15th to 16th centuries. A recurrence interval of 400-500 years is accordingly associated with these event deposits. These findings demonstrate great tsunami risks exist in the South China Sea basin and call for more attestations and future studies. The major contribution of this study is also supported by the AD 1076 Guangzhou tsunami, which is comparable in age to the middle event deposit.

AB Paleozoic evolution of the western Tien Shan, which is built up on the basement of the Karakum continent, is poorly constrained compared to the better investigated Tien Shan terranes along the margin of the Tarim Craton. We present magmatic, metamorphic and detrital zircon ages for the regionally metamorphosed Baisun block and the metasediments comprising the Karakum basement in the westernmost parts of the South Tien Shan terrane. Age spectra of detrital zircon from metasediments of the Baisun metamorphic block and the western South Tien Shan show remarkable similarities over the vast area extending for ca. 500 km and are characterized by major Neoproterozoic peak at 1200-600 Ma and smaller peaks at 2300-1700 and 2700-2400 Ma. The 570-540 Ma ages of the youngest grains define late Neoproterozoic (Ediacaran) - early Cambrian maximum depositional ages of the metasediments. Comparison of the obtained age spectra with those published for the adjacent Tien Shan terranes indicate that the detrital zircon grains in the studied Ediacaran sediments were derived from the southern Precambrian continents of Karakum and Tarim while transport from the Northern Tien Shan was limited. The age of the Barrovian metamorphism in the Baisun block is constrained by ages of anatectic granites in the range 352-340 Ma, corresponding to early Carboniferous. These ages well match the 340-330 Ma ages, established for the adjacent Lolabulak and Garm metamorphic blocks. Based on the regional distribution of suture zones we suggest that during the Carboniferous the relatively small tectonic blocks of the South Gissar comprised an archipelago, located between the larger continents of Karakum and Tarim and possibly connected with the Paleotethys Ocean. The archipelago scenario can explain hot and rapid metamorphic and tectonic processes, documented in the South Gissar, similar to the ongoing collision along the Australia - SE Asia junction.

AB Radiometric calibration of the Cryogenian glaciations is critical in understanding the nature of the climatic, geochemical and biological events in the Cryogenian period. However, the timing of termination of the Sturtian glaciation remains unsettled. Here we carried out new SIMS U-Pb zircon dating from two tuff layers at the non-glacial Datangpo Formation at the Jiangjunshan section in Guizhou, South China. The SIMS U-Pb zircon analyses yield U-Pb concordia ages of 659.3 +/- 2.4 Ma and 657.3 +/- 3.2 Ma for the two tuff layers, respectively. The age of 659.3 +/- 2A Ma obtained from the tuff layer occurring at the boundary between Sturtian diamictites and the non-glacial Datangpo Formation is regarded as the best age estimate for the termination of Sturtian glaciation in South China. This new U-Pb age is well consistent with those from the previous studies, suggesting a globally synchronous termination of the Sturtian glaciation at ca. 659 Ma. The onset of the Marinoan glaciation has been estimated to occur at ca. 649 Ma, based on the radiometric age obtained in this study and previous cyclostratigraphic results. Thus it is argued that the Marinoan glaciation was a long-lived glaciation and spanned approximately 14 million years.

AB A comprehensive geophysical profile stretching northward from near Tianchi (on the southern margin of the Junggar Basin) to Zalat (near the northern margin of the Junggar Basin) was carried out in an attempt to probe the basement structure and properties of the eastern Junggar Basin, NW China. Along the profile the seismically-converted waves were used to determine the P- and S-wave velocity structures of the crust and uppermost mantle. A joint inversion of gravitational and magnetic data was also performed along the profile to acquire the density and magnetic intensity. The results revealed that the crust of the eastern Junggar Basin is composed of the upper, middle and lower layers. In particular, deformation mainly occurs within the middle crust, a process which has affected the crustal thickness. The middle crust, with a relatively low velocity and low density, changes laterally. It thins at its center but thickens at both ends of the profile. The crystalline crust along the profile is structurally convex, with some thrust faults, indicating that it has experienced a strong north-south compression. Combining geological and geochemical data, we found that the eastern Junggar Basin comprises the Manas Terrane in the south and the Ulungu Terrane in the north, separated by the Dishuiquan-Sangequan Suture Zone (DSSZ). The Ulungu Terrane has a double-layered basement the upper layer is a Hercynian folded basement; the lower is a crystalline basement of Mid-Late Proterozoic age. The Manas Terrane has a single-layered crystalline basement. The north-south compression causes the eastern Junggar Basin's convex structure and the consequent subduction southward beneath the Northern Tianshan Orogenic Belt, giving rise to a rapid uplift of the Bogda Mountains and the frequent occurrences of major earthquakes. Based on the observations of the 2D velocity structure beneath the eastern Junggar Basin, the 2D density structure and 2D geomagnetic intensity structure are also observed. Combining these observations with geological and geochemical data, we assume that the eastern Junggar Basin has an oceanic basement, but with some small micro-continental blocks. In addition, basic to ultra-basic rocks from the uppermost mantle may have squeezed into the crust through the deep faults and mixed with the crustal material already there, leading to the relatively thin crust, as well as its high seismic velocity, high density and high magnetic intensity.

AB This study presents new apatite fission-track data collected from intrusive and sedimentary rocks of the western Qinling mountain range. Results show a large range of data, with ages spanning from Upper Jurassic to Oligocene. No particular age-elevation relationships have been detected. Thermal modelling shows clearly that the region was affected by a nearly steady-state slow cooling starting from the Jurassic. This is particularly true for samples collected north of the West Qinling Fault whereas samples collected to the south show a re-heating event, followed by enhanced exhumation. As a whole, these data testify that the studied part of the western Qinling region was relatively stable for a long period and relatively insensitive to the tectonics related to the growth of the Tibetan Plateau. The present-day relief is mainly the result of transtensional tectonics that occurred in the Eocene.

AB The eastern Qilian Shan is a tectonically-active region consisting of a series of faults with bounded intermountain basins and is located within the transition zone between the mainland Tibetan Plateau and the Alax Block. Active deformation affecting the topography in this region can be quantified based on geomorphic indices. Therefore, we applied the geomorphic indices (hypsometry and stream-power incision model) to evaluate the tectonic deformation pattern of the eastern Qilian Shan. Hypsometric curves and S-A plots of the selected seven rivers were determined. HI values of every single sub-basins were also calculated. The results show that the local topographic evolution of the eastern Qilian Shan is in pre-steady state and will soon reach its equilibrium state. According to the analysis of regional climate condition (e.g., rainfall and glaciers distribution) and fault characteristics, it is suggested that abundant glacial snowmelt water sustains fluvial incision, and tectonic deformation from sustained northeastward expansion of the Tibetan Plateau is the main reason for the landscape growth. Combining the research of the deep electric structure beneath the Gulang Boundary Zone, we claimed that the eastern Qilian Shan (even the northeastern Tibet) has been growing and expanding northeastward since the middle Miocene, and its leading edge now is the Hexibao-Sidaoshan Fault. On the premise of synthetically considering the western and middle parts of the Qilian Shan, it is suggested that the Hexibao-Sidaoshan Fault area will rise into a mountain in 1-2 Ma.

AB A ternary glassy chalcogenide material, Ag20Ge28Se52, is analyzed for structural, electronic, vibrational, and ion dynamical properties. The structural analysis has revealed some interesting substructures, which are typically found only in Se-rich or Ge-rich materials. The radial distribution function of the Ag20Ge28Se52 model illustrates reasonably good agreement with experiment. The vibrational density of states (VDOS) is characterized, and the nature of the modes is revealed as a function of energy. Finally, the dynamics of Ag are explored by investigating diffusion and hopping characteristics of Ag, and the character of trapping centers.

AB We revealed the significant structural relaxation with unprecedent hardness increment of 120% in an electro-deposited amorphous Mo-O alloy upon annealing, which is much higher than that in the conventional metallic glasses (< 15%). The relaxation kinetics was well described by a stretched exponential function with a Kohlrausch index of 0.51 and relaxation time of 115 s at 623 K. In addition, the significant structural relaxation was also reflected by a much higher creep resistance and smaller strain rate sensitivity after annealing. The significant hardness increment suggested that the as-deposited amorphous alloy has a highly disordered glassy state equivalently obtained by quenching at similar to 10(12)K s(-1). This was consistent with the structural observation that the as-deposited amorphous alloy has a low volume fraction (7%) of icosahedral-like medium range ordered (IMRO) clusters. Upon annealing, significant structural relaxation stemmed from the structural ordering, where the volume fraction of IMRO clusters increased to 19%.

AB Understanding and predicting the compositional dependence of the stiffness of silicate glasses is key for various technological applications. Here, we propose a new topological model for predicting the Young's modulus of silicate glasses. We show that the Young's modulus is governed by the volumetric density of bond-stretching and bond-bending topological constraints acting in the atomic network. The predicted Young's modulus values offer an excellent agreement with molecular dynamics and experimental data over a wide domain of compositions (the entire calcium aluminosilicate ternary system) and a large range of Young's modulus values (from around 80 to 160 GPa).

AB A new magnetic Fe36Co22Cr17Ni15Zr10 high entropy amorphous alloy has been prepared and its crystallization behavior and kinetics been studied. The results show that, under non-isothermal conditions, the crystallization activation energy E-x was calculated by the Kissinger equation, which yield 373 kJmol(-1). Relation plot of E-x vs crystallization volume fraction(x) manifests the non-isothermal crystallization process is from difficult to easy. On the other hand, base on Arrhenius relation, the crystallization activation energy E-c under isothermal conditions was calculated to be 370 kJmol(-1). Relation plot of E-c vs x manifests the isothermal crystallization process is from easy to difficult. The isothermal kinetics was modeled by Johnson-Mehl-Avrami(JMA) equation, as the isothermal annealing temperature increases, the nucleus growth mechanism from diffusion-controlled 3-D growth convert into interface-controlled 3-D growth. Though proper heat treatment, the saturation magnetization M-s of this alloy can reach up to 106.8A.m(2)kg(-1), it will become promising functional materials in the future.

AB Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are carried out to study the tensile-compression cyclic loading behavior and structural changes in Al (metal)-Cu50Zr50 (metallic glass) thin film interface model (TFIM). The model comprises of 2.88 million atoms, interactions between Al, Cu and Zr atoms are modeled using EAM (Embedded Atom Method) potential. The tensile-compression test cycles are performed at a temperature of 100 K and strain rate of 10(9) s(-1) at two pre-strains (e = 0.033 and e = 0.2). The stress-strain curves reveal that during cycle-I tensile loading, TFIM exhibits yield strength of 266 MPa and peak strength of 760 MPa. Increase in the tensile pre-strain from e = 0.033 to e = 0.2 has no significant effect on the compressive yield stress. The deformation mechanism in Al is by slip by partial dislocation nucleation. Shockley partial dislocation density (2 x 10(17)-4.5 x 10(17) m(-2)) is observed to be the highest of all the other types of dislocations. Complete SFT (stacking fault tetrahedra) is formed in Al region when strained beyond e = 0.033 and during compression cycles only. The number of SFT increases from 8 during tensile to 28 during the compression cycle indicating that compressive test assists the formation of SFT. Beyond the elastic strain, the collapse of (00120) and (0 2 8 2) polyhedral network is observed in Cu50Zr50 metallic glass region at distance of 25 angstrom from the interface resulting in the creation of low dense regions.

AB To study the modifier role of ZnO on the structural and transport properties, the quaternary glass system xZnO-(30-x) Li2O-10TeO(2)-60B(2)O(3) (x = 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mol%) was prepared by the conventional melt quenching technique. Amorphous nature of the prepared glasses was confirmed by X-ray diffraction studies. Density (rho) of the glass samples was measured by Archimedes' principle and it was found to vary non-linearly between 3.06 and 3.44 g/cm(3) with the addition of heavy metal oxide (ZnO) mole concentration. Oxygen packing density (OPD) values also varied non-linearly between 66.78 and 74.69 g atm/1. Glass transition temperature (T-g) of the glass system was measured using temperature modulated differential scanning calorimeter and Tg was found to increase from 429 degrees C-449 degrees C with the increase of ZnO content. Based on the density and molecular weight of the glass composition, mechanical properties like Young's modulus (E), Shear modulus (S), Bulk modulus (K) etc., have been calculated with the help of Makishima-Mackenzie model in terms of the packing ratio (V rho) and dissociation energy (G(t)). FTIR and Raman spectroscopy studies reveal that the glass network consists of various types of BO3, BO4 units along with TeO3, TeO4 and ZnO4 structural units. To study transport properties, AC conductivity measurements were carried out on the glass system in the frequency range 5 Hz-35 MHz and it was observed that the ionic conductivity plays significant role. At low temperatures (30 degrees C and 50 degrees C) the results of conductivity did not give good results. AC conductivity of the studied glass system is increased with increase in frequency and temperature. The highest value of AC conductivity of the glass network is of the order 10(-2)Omega(-1) cm(-1), Impedance plots (Cole-Cole) exhibited semicircle behaviour.

AB In order to study the effect of the mutual substitution of Fe and Ni on the plasticity of Fe/Ni-based metallic glasses (MGs) from the atomic arrangement structure perspective, we investigate the short-range order (SRO) and medium-range order (MRO) structures of Fe80P14B6, Fe40Ni40P14B6 and Ni80P14B6 MGs using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations method. The results reveal that Fe40Ni40P14B6 MG has more vertex sharing clusters and less edge-sharing clusters compared to Fe80P14B6 and Ni80P14B6 MGs, indicating that Fe40Ni40P14B6 MG possesses more cavities or boundaries on MRO, which are beneficial for plastic deformation. In addition, large clusters have a relatively strong connection with comparatively smaller clusters in Fe80P14B6 and Ni80P14B6 MGs while the clusters with the similar size tend to form the nearest neighbor in Fe40Ni40P14B6 MG. Compared with the former, the connection mode of the latter may form relatively loose packing, which can facilitate plastic deformation. Fe40Ni40P14B6 MG has larger population of 142 x, 1441 and 1661 bond pairs, which are crystal-like clusters, and relatively smaller 1551and 1541. Besides, Fe40Ni40P14B6 MG has less < 0 0 12 0 >, < 0 1 10 2 > and < 0 2 10 1 > clusters and more < 0 4 4 3 > and < 0 4 4 6 > compared to Fe80P14B6 and Ni80P14B6 MGs, indicating the replacement of Fe by Ni or Ni by Fe in Fe/Ni-based MGs reduces five-fold rotational symmetry, which is beneficial to plasticity.

The changes in the structure of studied glasses were observed by using FTIR technique and it was found that glasses containing different structure units of borate and tellurite groups. The change in the many optical and physical parameters such as density, molar volume, band gap, optical backing density, refractive index and others were studied. The density was found to increase with the addition of TiO2 till 1 mol% then begin to decrease and the opposite trend was observed to molar volume. Energy band gap was measured by two techniques ASF and Tauc's models and their values was very close to each other and to decrease with the addition of TiO2. The refractive index was found to increase with the addition of TiO2 from 2.4 for base glass to 2.59 for glass containing 3 mol% of TiO2. The ionic concentration of Ti, the interionic distance r(i), field strength F, dielectric constant, molar refraction index r(m), molar polarizability, average electronegativity, and the reflection loss (r(L)) were rise with increasing TiO2 content. On the other hand, there are some properties such as transmission coefficient (T) was found to decrease with increasing the concentration of Ti ions.

AB In this work, hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) films were prepared by using a radio frequency (13.56 MHz) plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method at 220 degrees C. The influence of the annealing treatments on the microstructure and optical properties of the a-C:H films has been investigated. Raman and X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS) results showed that the sp2 carbon fraction and sp2/sp3 ratio increase and sp3 carbon fraction decrease with increasing the annealing temperature. However, with increasing annealing temperature, the D and G peak positions and the G peak FWHM have no obvious changes. The spectroscopic ellipsometry suggested that the density, refractive index n and the extinction coefficient k of the as deposited film and the films annealed at 300 and 400 degrees C are not affected obviously by thermal annealing treatments. However, when the annealing temperature is higher than 400 degrees C, the films become high-density and opaque, meanwhile, the film thickness decrease significantly. The UV-VIS spectroscopy measurement indicated that the increase of sp2 fraction and graphitization features of the a-C: H films result in the decrease of the films transmission and optical band gap.

AB An extensive study has been carried out to predict changes in the structure and elastic properties of the ternary borate-based PbO-B2O3-V2O5 and Li2O-ZnO-B2O3 glass systems over a wide range of composition. The structural role of PbO, Li2O, ZnO and V2O5 oxides in borate network has been explored by interpreting the compositional changes of density, molar volume, fractal bond connectivity, packing density and dissociation energy per unit volume in terms of the basic structural units that constituting the glass. The applicability of Makishima-Mackenzie's theory, Rocherulle et al. model and Abd El-Moneim and Alfifi's approaches has also been demonstrated for both glass systems. It has been found that the concentrations of the basic structural units BO3, BO4, ZnO4, VO4 and VO5 play a dominant role in explaining changes in packing density, dissociation energy per unit volume, elastic moduli and Poisson's ratio. In compared to Makishima-Mackenzie's theory, Rocherulle et al. model is more suitable for predicting the elastic moduli. On the other hand, the agreement between experimental and theoretical Poisson's ratios on the basis of Makishima-Mackenzie's theory is much better than that is based in Rocherulle et al. model. The discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental values has been interpreted by correlating the elastic properties with compositional parameters. In addition to this, Abd El-Moneim and Alfifi's approaches are valid for Li2O-ZnO-B2O3 glass system.

AB The viscosity and the shear relaxation behavior of supercooled Ag- and Sn- metaphosphate liquids are measured using parallel plate techniques. The fragility index m of these liquids, when taken together with that of other metaphosphate liquids, shows variation over a rather large range spanning from similar to 30 to 90 and is found to be a sensitive function of the strength and extent of connectivity or coupling between the phosphate chains provided by the modifier-oxygen coordination polyhedra. The high fragility of the Ag-metaphosphate liquid (m approximate to 90) is a result of the weak inter-chain coupling which is manifested in a polymer-like rheological behavior that is in contrast with the network-liquid like behavior of the metaphosphate liquids with lower fragility.

AB The structures of pseudo-binary P-Se and As-S glasses with compositions close to the P4Se3 and As4S3 stoichiometry with a few atom %Ge doping were determined using Monte Carlo simulations constrained by density and x-ray scattering measurements. We find that these glasses consist predominantly of P4Se3 and As4S3 molecules. The Ge doping results in some important differences between the two glasses. The P-Se glass displays significantly higher intermolecular connectivity via P-Se-Ge linkages, consistent with the significantly higher glass transition temperature and lower fragility of this liquid compared to its As-S counterpart. We also speculate that a consequence of this difference in the intermolecular connectivity would be to delay any pressure induced conversion from a molecular to a network structure for the Ge doped P-Se glass compared to the Ge-doped As-S glass.

AB Material removal and tribological behaviors of fused silica (FS) were studied by scratching under Rockwell indenters with various tip radii, aiming to find scientific clues to understand microscopic removal mechanisms of hard-brittle materials. It was found that the elastic depth took the main part of the total scratched depth of FS, while the remanent depth became obvious only under the smallest indenter. Coefficient of friction (CoF) had a sharp increase at the velocity of 200 mm/min in most circumstances, and plastic removal without cracking of FS could be obtained at higher velocities under the smallest indenter. The ploughing model could analyze the ploughing and adhesion parts of CoF during scratching, although overestimated the ploughing one for FS. It was deduced that during scratching on FS, variations of CoF were mainly attributed to adhesion, while plastic removal of the hard-brittle FS was facilitated by higher pressures and higher velocities.

AB Mid-infrared transparent germano-gallate glasses (with gallium oxide as main component) have been studied following the composition law (100-x)[48.3GaO(3/2)-32.2GeO(2)-19.5BaO]-xKO(1/2) (with x = 0, 5, 10, 13, 17 mol %). All prepared glasses are transparent from approximately 280 nm up to 5.5 mu m, with a measured linear refractive index and density decreasing respectively from 1.72 to 1.67 (at 1538 nm) and 4.79 to 4.34 g/cm(3) with increasing potassium oxide content. As expected, the increase of potassium oxide content also results in a decrease of the glass transition temperature (698 to 671 degrees C) and the viscosity in the softening regime whereas the thermal expansion coefficient increases (4.8 to 10.3 x 10(-6)K(-1)). These results are related to the depolymerization of the 3D interconnected glass network which has been studied by Raman spectroscopy. Large thermal stability criteria (difference between onset of crystallization and glass transition temperatures) ranging from 182 to 199 degrees C have been measured by DSC for the compositions containing potassium oxide, suggesting strong potential for fiber drawing from glass preforms. The 40.1GaO(3/2)-26.7GeO(2)-16.2BaO-17KO(1/2) glass composition (in cation mol.%, which corresponds to 28Ga(2)O(3)-37GeO(2)-23BaO-12K(2)O in mol.%) was then selected for further investigation. Its mechanical properties (Young and shear moduli, Poisson's ratio, hardness) were measured, showing values close to those reported for well-known barium gallo-germanate (BGG) glasses. A thorough crystallization study was then carried out using DSC (Marotta's method), X-Ray diffraction and electron microscopies (TEM and SEM) to better understand the unexpected surface crystallization issues observed during the glass preform fiber drawing process. The potential of using such germano-gallate glasses to produce mid-infrared optical fiber of high mechanical strength is discussed.

AB Due to the high sensitivity of amorphous forming ability on purity, Fe-based amorphous alloys are always made with high-purity raw materials which are energy wasting for purification and expensive, thereby limiting their wider application. Here, we proposed an ultra-low cost and energy-efficient production process for Fe-based amorphous alloys, with pretreated molten iron from the blast furnace. Fe-x(P10C9Si1)(5-0.05x) (x = 76-82) amorphous alloys with excellent manufacturability and magnetic properties were successfully prepared with the new process. The impurities containing C, P, and Si in the molten iron from a blast furnace were used as useful components, while other minor impurities like Ti and Mn do not apparently affect the GFA and magnetic properties. Attractive magnetic properties, including low H-c of 3.1-5.1 A/m, high mu(e) of 6.1-8.4 x 10(3) at 1 kHz, high B-s of 1.25-1.48 T were achieved in ribbon samples after optimal annealing. Rod samples with a diameter up to 1.5 mm were readily prepared and exhibit high strength of 3.37 GPa. The ultra-low cost, energy saving effects and excellent soft magnetic properties will render the production process a new generation for Fe-based amorphous alloys and widen the applications.

AB A magnetic nanocomposite glass consisting of a zinc barium borate glass matrix and up to 15 vol. % (%(V)) Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs, diameter 50 to 100 nm) was synthesized by coating glass grains with 3D mixing and subsequent sintering using a spark plasma sintering (SPS) furnace. The achieved relative density is better than 99 % when iron oxide content is smaller than 2 %(V). Agglomeration of nanoparticles is observed at larger content. Composites were submitted to an alternating magnetic field of 1000 G maximum intensity and 250 kHz frequency. A fast heating of the sample was observed thanks to the magnetic particles (T-max approximate to 450 degrees C). A treatment of 1 h at T-max promoted some viscoelastic relaxation at an indentation site but was not sufficient to induce some visible crack healing.

AB Myocardial infarction (MI) is a severe heart disease caused by acute, persistent ischemia or hypoxia and finally leads to heart failure and sudden death. However, the intrinsic molecular mechanisms of MI remain largely unknown. lncRNAs have also been implicated in the process of ischemic heart diseases. However, the role of lncRNA TTTY15 in MI is not elucidated. We evaluated the expression of TTTY15 in MI and human cardiomyocyte under hypoxia. We explored the role of TTTY15 in cell injury under hypoxia. We searched for potential target of TTTY15. Up-regulation of TTTY15 was associated with hypoxia. Silencing TTTY15 prevented hypoxia-induced cell apoptosis and rescued the cell migration and invasion. TTTY15 targeted miR-455-5p, which regulated the Jun dimerization protein 2 (JDP2) expression. Knocking down miR-455-5p abolished effects of TTTY-15 silencing on cell injury. Suppression of long noncoding RNA TTTY15 attenuates hypoxia-induced cardiomyocytes injury by targeting miR-455-5p.

AB Recent studies have revealed a common cartilage genetic regulatory network among vertebrates, cephalochordates, and arthropods. It has been proposed that this network was originally established for the dense connective tissues of ancestral invertebrates and subsequently recruited for chondrocyte differentiation in various lineages. This reasoning prompted questions about whether the evolution of cartilage from dense connective tissues occurred in the common ancestors of vertebrates. Alternatively, the evolution of cartilage may have occurred independently in agnathans and in gnathostomes, because extant agnathans (cyclostomes) are known to possess a matrix composition different from that of gnathostomes. Here, we identified the gene which is likely to encode one of the matrix proteins unique to lamprey cartilage, which we designated pharymprin. Pharymprin shows specific expression in larval pharyngeal chondrocytes. Like lamprins, which are the known matrix proteins of lamprey trabecular cartilage, pharymprin is also composed of repeated sequences. However, the repeated sequence is distinct from that of lamprins. The presence of two distinct matrix proteins in lamprey cartilage supports the hypothesis that true cartilage evolved independently in cyclostomes and gnathostomes.

ID CELL-CYCLE; CANCER; REVEALS
AB Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death. Increasing evidence suggests that cell cycle dysregulation is one of the hallmarks of cancer. In this study, by using the GEO database, we predicted the cell cycle-related protein CDK1 and BUB1 to be significantly overexpressed in PDAC tissues. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the clinical pathological significance of CDK1 and BUB1 in PDAC.
   Methods: To explore the role of CDK1 and BUB1 in PDAC progression and evaluate their prognostic value, we investigated the expression patterns of CDK1 and BUB1 by using immunohistochemical staining in 99 PDAC and 71 normal pancreatic tissues with complete pathological parameters and survival data.
   Results: CDK1 and BUB1 were significantly overexpressed in PDAC tissues. The expression of CDK1 was correlated with tumor size and histological grade, and the expression of BUB1 was correlated with the tumor size of PDAC. With regard to survival, a high expression of either CDK1 or BUB1 was correlated with a short survival of PDAC patients. Additionally, PDAC patients with a concurrent high expression of CDK1 and BUB1 showed the shortest survival.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that CDK1 and BUB1 may play a role in PDAC progression and could be prognostic biomarkers for PDAC patients.

AB As a tumor metastasis suppressor gene, LASS2 has been found to be negatively associated with the stage of bladder cancer and overall survival of patients. However, the mechanisms regulating LASS2 in bladder cancer remain poorly understood. Here, we aim to identify a miRNA that targets LASS2 from bladder cancer-associated miRNAs and to reveal its potential functions in bladder cancer cells. Through miRNA microarray and bioinformatics analyses, we identified miR-3622a as a negative regulator of LASS2. The expression levels of miR-3622a in bladder cancer tissues were negatively correlated with the overall survival of patients. Overexpression of miR-3622a significantly increased the proliferation and invasion abilities of bladder cancer cells. In conclusion, our results indicate that miR-3622a promotes the proliferation and invasion of bladder cancer cells by downregulating LASS2.

AB Treatment of breast cancer by delivering important tumor suppressor plasmids is a promising approach in the field of clinical medicine. We transfected p21 and p53 tumor suppressor plasmids, into different breast cancer cell lines using inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) of carbonate apatite to evaluate the effect of gene expression on reducing breast cancer cell growth. In triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line, the cytotoxicity assay upon combined delivery of p21 and p53 plasmid loaded NPs showed significant decrease in cell growth compared to distinct p21 or p53 treatments. Also, in MCF-7 and 4T1 cell lines, significant reduction in cellular growth was observed following p21 or p53 plasmid transfection. The Western blot data showed that NP loaded p21 and p53 transgene delivery in MDA-MB-231 cell line resulted in a noteworthy decrease in phosphorylated form of MAPK protein of MAPK/ERK pathway. The in vivo studies in syngeneic breast cancer mouse model demonstrated that the rate of growth and final tumor volume were reduced to a greater extent in mice that received intravenous injection of p21 + NP and p53 + NP therapeutics.

AB Background: There is significant controversy in the literature regarding the relationship between hypoxia and salivary gland neoplasms (SGNs).
   Objective: The current study aims to investigate levels of hypoxia markers in both benign and malignant salivary neoplasms.
   Patients and methods: The current study sample is comprised of a total of 62 samples. HIF-1 alpha expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Additionally, HIF-1 alpha mRNA and miR-210 levels were assessed using qRT-PCR.
   Results: No differences in HIF-1 alpha expression were observed among the control group, benign and malignant SGNs. Similarly, HIF-1 alpha mRNA levels were similar between benign and malignant SGNs. Also, there was no difference in miR-210 expression between case and control groups.
   Conclusion: The angiogenic markers, miR-210 and HIF-1 alpha, do not appear to distinguish malignancy in salivary glands.

AB Background: Tumor microenvironment (TM) has been deeply concerned. However, the pretumor microenvironment (PTM) was poorly understood. The purpose in this study was to explore the possible pathophysiological features of PTM before hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) appearance.
   Methods: Mouse livers with no swelling but with tumors present elsewhere in the body after subcutaneous injection of H22 in the fore underarm were considered a PTM, HCC tumors presenting far away from the PTM were regarded as a TM, and the healthy livers of mice without injection of H22 were regarded as a physiological microenvironment (PM). The transcriptomes of samples were generated using RNA-seq and validated using RT-qPCR.
   Results: Overall, 4483 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found in the TM compared with the PTM (TM/PTM), but only 194 were altered in the PTM compared with the PM (PTM/PM). Among those 194 DEGs, 104 displayed upregulation and 90 downregulation. Some of these DEGs could promote the ability to resist cancerization or facilitate cancer metastasis, while others indicated liver impairment. The DEGs were involved in 16 relevant pathways. Additionally, the frequency of alternative splicing (AS) in the DEGs in various samples was positively related to the expression of those DEGs.
   Conclusions: The PTM initiatively armed itself to combat cancerization when its indications appeared although the PTM did not manifest any tissue swelling. However, the cancer cells were negatively influencing immunity to prevent clearance and positively promoting transformation to construct a suitable environment. During transformation by cancer cells, some genes with acquired AS participated in the construction of the PTM. This alteration created an invadable space and an appropriate environment for cancer cells.

AB The present study revealed the spatial variability of bacteria in relation to physicochemical variations at four different locations (Diu - DIU, Veraval - VER, Porbandar - POR and Okha - OKH) along the Gujarat coast (Arabian Sea, India). The natural habitat was analyzed for temperature, salinity, pH, total dissolved solids, total organic content, total inorganic content, biological oxygen demand, conductivity and total dissolved oxygen. The lowest salinity and conductivity were observed at the VER site, whereas the highest salinity and conductivity were measured with OKH samples. In contrast, the pH was slightly alkaline at all of the sites. The VER site contained the maximum total dissolved solids (TDS), total carbon (TC), total organic carbon (TOC), and total inorganic carbon (TIC), while OKH showed the maximum dissolve oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), pH, temperature, conductivity, and salinity. The physicochemical characteristics showed that the Gujarat coast is alkaline and has a nutrient heterogeneous nature. Average well color development (AWCD) values, calculated using Biolog EcoPlates, showed that the microbial community from VER contained the highest metabolic activities and could metabolize all 31 substrates, followed by DIU > OKH > POR samples. In contrast, the abundance of the bacterial community, determined by qRT-PCR, was maximum in VER samples, followed by OKH > POR > DIU samples. The Shannon and Simpson indices showed that DIU, POR and OKH seawater clone libraries were more diverse. Furthermore, Chao estimator revealed the high diversity of POR and DIU clone libraries. Interestingly, DIU and OKH did not share any common operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and overall, the maximum bacterial diversity was observed with the POR seawater sample. Moreover, these observations were supported by statistical analysis, such as canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The molecular phylogeny revealed the dominance of Proteobacteria followed by Firmicutes. Within the Proteobacteria phylum, most of the sequences were affiliated with the Gammaproteobacteria class. In total, about 726 OTUs were observed from all four sites which covers 59.79% DIU, 87.5% VER, 50% POR and 98.83% OKH of samples. This study is the first report to describe physicochemical attributes and the bacterial diversity of the coastal area of Gujarat. The study will provide useful insights about bacterial diversity, distribution, and abundance, as well as their relationships with the habitat.

AB Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is originally identified as a conserved RNA surveillance mechanism that rapidly degrades aberrant mRNA containing premature termination codons (PTCs). However, the molecular regulation mechanisms by which microRNAs inhibit NMD has not been well understood. Here we identified that miR-4651 participated in the NMD pathway by downregulating expression levels of SMG9. We provided evidences that (1) Overexpression of miR-4651 mimic significantly inhibited the expression of SMG9 (P < 0.05); (2) NMD substrates genes, TBL2 and GADD45B were both increased at mRNA and protein expression levels when SMG9 was suppressed by siRNA, whereas decreased by SMG9 overexpression; (3) Expression of SMG9 was significantly increased but TBL2, GADD45B were significantly decreased when cells transfected with miR-4651 inhibitor (P < 0.05). These results indicated that miR-4651 regulated NMD by targeting SMG9 mRNA. Our study highlights that miR-4651 represses NMD. miR-4651 targets SMG9 and represses the expression levels of SMG9. NMD activity is decreased additionally when SMG9 is inhibited. The present study provides evidence for microRNA/NMD regulatory mechanism.

AB Avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) is an oncogenic retrovirus that causes severe economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that has been described in various biological systems and pathogenic processes. However, the immune mechanisms in response to circRNAs remain unknown. In this study, high-throughput transcriptome sequencing was used to detect circRNAs present in chicken macrophage (HD11) and chick embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells infected with ALV-J. We identified 7684 circRNAs from diverse genomic locations in CEF and HD11 after ALV-J infection, these RNAs showed complex expression patterns that differed based on the cells type and infection time. In total, 302 differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs and 164 DE circRNAs were identified in CEF and HD11 after ALV-J infection, respectively. CircRNA7419-associated with KDM4C- and circRNA6679 and circRNA6680-associated with TNFAIP6-were involved in the immune response upon ALV-J infection in CEF. Host genes were analyzed through further bioinformatics analysis. The result confirmed that a large number of DE circRNAs corresponded to several immune -associated or tumor-associated terms and pathways, such as Mucin type O-Glycan biosynthesis, MAPK signaling pathway, B cell receptor signaling, and Wnt signaling pathway in CEF, as well as Jak-STAT signaling pathway, apoptosis, and MAPK signaling pathway in HD11. CircRNAs related to the B cell receptor signaling pathway in CEF, and the Jak-STAT signaling pathway in HD11, were selected for circRNA-miRNA interaction network analyses. Our study indicates that circRNAs expression was altered by ALV-J infection in both CEF and HD11, and may play a key role in the progression of ALV-J infection.

ID OVOCALYXIN-32 GENE; EGG-PRODUCTION; ASSOCIATION; GROWTH
AB The goose is one of the most important waterfowl, having lowing laying rate. Previous studies have shown the SNPs in the introns of MAGI-1 (Record-106975) and ACSF2 (Record-106582) significantly associated with egg production in geese. However, the mechanism of those SNPs influencing egg production remains unclear. In this study, the three goose breeds (Yangzhou geese, Zhedong white geese, and Carlos geese) with obviously different egg production were selected, and the allele frequency distribution and functions of those SNPs were investigated. The results suggested that the allele frequency distribution of ACSF2 was significantly different among the three goose breeds (chi c(2) = 92.377, Pc = 2.29 x 10(-22)), with the C allele appearing at frequencies of 0.29 in the Yangzhou geese and 0.94 in the Carlos geese. In contrast, the allele frequencies of MAGI-1 were not significantly different among the different goose breeds. Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that the expression of MAGI-1 with the AG genotype individuals was significantly higher than those of the AA and GG genotype. For ACSF2, the CC genotype had significantly higher expression than both the AC genotype and the AA genotype. The luciferase reporter analysis revealed that the site-directed mutation ACSF2 (A > C) significantly drove the expression activity. Further analysis suggested that the mutation altered the binding site of the transcription factor BARHL2. Binding of BARHL2 to the ACSF2 intron was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis. Thus, our findings revealed the A > C mutation of ACSF2 (Record-106582) could promote the expression by regulating the binding of BARHL2, resulting in differences in egg performance, which provided molecular insights into the effect of the polymorphism in ACSF2 on egg performance in geese.

AB Introduction: With the introduction of vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) as new surgical technique, the need arose for strategies that could safely prolong graft preservation. Ex-vivo machine perfusion is a promising technique and is currently applied in solid organ transplantation. There is still limited evidence in the field of VCA and free flap transplantation. This gene expression study aimed to assess the degree of ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury after preservation and replantation of free muscle flaps in a porcine model.
   Materials and methods: A microarray analysis was first conducted on muscle flaps preserved by ex-vivo perfusion versus cold storage, to select genes of interest for further investigation. The expression of these selected genes was then examined in a muscle flap replantation model after 18 hour ex-vivo perfusion (n = 14) using qRT-PCR. Two preservation solutions were compared to static cold storage: University of Wisconsin-mp (n = 5) and Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate solution (n = 5).
   Results: A selection of 8 genes was made based on micro-array results: Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 10-A like, Regulator of G-protein signaling 2, Nuclear factor kappa beta inhibitor zeta, Interleukin-1 beta, Fibroblast growth factor 6 and DNA damage-inducible transcript 4, Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha and Caspase-3. The muscle flap replantation experiment compared their expression patterns before and after preservation and replantation and showed overall comparable gene expression between the preservation groups.
   Conclusions: The expression of genes related to ischemia, apoptosis and inflammation was comparable between the ex-vivo perfusion and static cold storage groups. These results suggest that ex-vivo perfusion might be a promising technique for 18 hour muscle preservation in terms of decreasing ischemia-reperfusion injury.

AB Disruption of circadian clock may trigger the onset of diabetes mellitus and myocardial infarction. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is well-known risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and myocardial infarction.
   We performed a case-control study, where we explored the possible association between single nucleotide polymorphisms in three circadian rhythm genes (ARNTL, CLOCK, and PER2) and myocardial infarction in 657 patients with T2DM. The study group consisted of 231 patients with myocardial infarction and T2DM and a control group of 426 T2DM patients. We hypothesized that variations in the circadian rhythm genes in patients with T2DM could be an additional risk factor for myocardial infarction. The statistically significant difference was found in allelic (p = 1.1 x 10-5) and genotype distribution (p = 1.42 x 10-4) between two groups of the rs12363415 at the ARNTL gene locus.
   We provide evidence that genetic variability in the ARNTL gene might be associated with myocardial infarction in patients with T2DM.

AB PIWI family member piwil1, which associates with Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), is responsible in regulation of germ cell differentiation and maintenance of reproductive stem cells. In this study, we analyzed the piwil1 gene in Paralichthys olivaceus. Bioinformatics analysis and structure prediction showed that piwil1 had the conserved domains: PAZ domain and PIWI domain. Expression analysis during embryonic development implied that piwil1 gene was maternally inherited. The tissue distribution showed a sexually dimorphic gene expression pattern, with higher expression level in testis than ovary. In situ hybridization results demonstrated that piwil1 was predominantly distributed in oogonia, oocytes, sertoli cells and spermatocytes. A CpG island was predicted in the 5'-flanking region of piwil1 gene, and its methylation levels showed significant disparity between males and females, indicating that the sexually dimorphic expression of piwil1 gene might be regulated by methylation. Furthermore, we explored the distinct roles of human chorionic gonadotropin and 17 alpha-methyltestosterone in regulating the expression of piwil1, and found that piwil1 was interacting with the HPG axis hormones. These results indicated that piwil1 might play a crucial role in gonadal development and gametogenesis in Paralichthys olivaceus.

AB We explored genetic susceptibility profile of the South Indian women with a large set of SNPs and tested if the lack of association of type 2 diabetes genes with PCOS, recently observed in a number of studies, holds true for this Indian population and suggest probable universality of this phenomenon. A prioritized set of 92 SNPs that belong to important reproductive and metabolic pathway genes were genotyped on 250 PCOS cases and 299 ethnically matched controls, representing the southern Indian population of Hyderabad, using SEQUENOM MassARRAY iPLEX (TM) platform. These data were analyzed both for individual SNP association patterns as well as for gene-gene interactions, besides obtaining cumulative risk score and the ROC curve with the help of appropriate statistical packages such as PLINK, SNPAssoc of R-program, Haploview, GMDR and SPSS. The analysis of 72 of the 92 SNPs, after excluding 20 of those that showed either minor allele frequency < 1% and/or deviated from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (p < .001), suggested that only 13 were associated with PCOS at p <= .05, but none after correction for multiple testing. Further, neither any of the diabetic genes nor the interactions between diabetic and reproductive pathway genes were found to be significant even at p <= .05. The lack of association of any of the SNPs with PCOS and/or the gene-gene interactions among them may be because of the minor effects of each of them on the phenotype(OR < 2). Further, that none of the type 2 diabetes genes were associated with PCOS in the present study as well as in the earlier studies from different ethnic groups may indicate probable universality of this pattern. It is possible that there are still other genetic variants, novel as well as already known, which may confer greater risk than the ones considered in this study and further studies are warranted to ascertain this both in the present population as well as in other ethnic and/or geographic groups of the Indian subcontinent.

AB Objective: The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) H19 is an imprinted lncRNA with acknowledged roles in carcinogenesis.
   Methods: In the current study, we genotyped two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within H19 in 111 breast cancer patients and 130 age-matched healthy subjects using tetra primer-ARMS-PCR technique. The T allele of rs2839698 conferred breast cancer risk in the assessed population (OR (95% CI) = 2.52 (1.75-3.64), adjusted P value = 1.3E-6), while and the T allele of rs217727 had a protective effect (OR (95% CI) = 0.42 (0.27-0.66), adjusted P value = 2.8E-4). Both SNPs were associated with breast cancer risk in recessive, dominant and co-dominant models. The T C haplotype (rs2839698 and rs217727) significantly increased risk of breast cancer (OR (95% CI) = 2.4 (1.65-3.45), adjusted P value = 1.2E-5), while the C T haplotype had a protective role (OR (95% CI) = 0.31 (0.18-0.52), adjusted P value = 2.03E-5). The present study highlights the role of H19 SNPs in conferring risk of breast cancer in Iranian population. Future studies with larger sample sizes are required to verify these data.

AB Background and aim: Oxidative stress and impaired insulin secretion is an underlying major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) is involved in the regulation of reactive oxygen species production, insulin secretion, and lipid metabolism. Based on this we aimed to find an association of UCP2 (G-866A) polymorphism with the risk of T2D in South Indian population.
   Methods: A total of 318 T2D patients and 312 controls were enrolled in this study. All the study subjects were genotyped for UCP2 (G-866A) polymorphism using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, serum lipid profile, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured by standard biochemical methods. Fasting serum insulin level was measured by ELISA.
   Results: In UCP2 (G-866A) polymorphism, the distribution of GA (46%) and AA (14%) genotypes were significantly higher in T2D patients than the healthy controls. The frequency of GA and AA genotypes have high risk towards the development of T2D with an Odds Ratio (OR) of 1.55 (P = 0.01) and 2.04 (P = 0.01) respectively. Moreover, SNP-866 G > A allele was found to be significantly associated with T2D (OR = 1.48, P = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.16-1.88). Further, the UCP2 AA genotype showed significantly decreased level of insulin by the reduction in pancreatic beta-cell function in T2D patients.
   Conclusion: UCP2 (G-866A) polymorphism may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of insulin secretion thus leads to the development of T2D.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in animal growth and disease development, and sequence variation in microRNAs can alter their functions. Herein, we explored the effects of mutations in the miRNA-215 precursor sequence on the miRNA-215 regulatory network and resistance to Escherichia coli (E. coli). Polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) was used to detect sequence variations in Sutai and Meishan pigs. The miR-192 precursor sequence was not mutated, but the miR-215 precursor included an AT insertion mutation at position 6 (start from the first base of the miR-215 precursor) and a C/T mutation at position 43. Wild-type (WT) and mutant miR-215 precursor expression vectors were constructed to investigate the effects of sequence variation on expression of miR-215 and its target genes DLG5 and ALCAM, cytokine levels and E. coli adhesion. Compared with the WT control group, cells harbouring the C/T mutant vector displayed reduced miR-215 expression, increased target gene expression, elevated cytokine levels and rising E. coli adhesion, whereas cells harbouring the AT insertion mutant vector were not significantly changed. The sequence variation in the miRNA-215 precursor may affect the miRNA-215 regulatory network, and alter the stability of intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2 cells) and resistance to E. coli. Our findings provide guidance for future research on the regulatory mechanisms of miR-215 in porcine resistance to E. coli F18, and identifying effective genetic markers against this organism.

ID EXPRESSION PROFILE; CANCER; TISSUE
AB CircRNAs (Circular RNAs) are believed to be involved in a multitude of biological processes and can play crucial roles as miRNA (microRNA) sponges. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between circRNAs and ischemic stroke induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. The expression profiles of circRNAs in brain tissues were screened by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to identify novel differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs). Quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR was used to confirm circRNA expression data arising from HTS. In addition, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed to investigate mRNA function and to understand the characteristics of circRNAs. Finally, we created a circRNA-miRNA network. In total, 14,694 DECs, from 6 brain tissues, were screened; of these, 87 DECs showed a significant fold change > 2 (p < 0.05). CircRNAs showing significant upregulation included circRNA.17737, circRNA.8828 and circRNA.14479, while circRNA.1059, circRNA.9967 and circRNA.6952 were significant downregulation. The results were in accordance with HTS, showing that the HTS produced reliable data. Herein, we explored the relationship between circRNAs and ischemic stroke induced by MCAO in rats. Our data provide a new and better understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with ischemic stroke. The precise role of DECs associated with MCAO and target miRNAs should be validated in further studies.

AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs) act as pivotal functions in tumor progression. Nevertheless, the functions and mechanism of circRNAs in T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) remain unclear. In this work, we first screened the differentially expressed circRNAs between T-LBL tissues and normal infantile thymus and circ-LAMP1 was identified the highest expressed circRNA in cancerous tissues. qRT-PCR further verified its upregulation in T-LBL tissues and cell lines. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) experiment proved the cell proliferation-promoting role of circ-LAMP1. This effect is partially dependent on its inhibition on cell apoptosis proved by flow cytometric assay. Dual-luciferase reporter system further identified that miR-615-5p could be sponged by circ-LAMP1 and discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (DDR2) 3'-UTR is the direct target of miR-615-5p. Rescue assays demonstrated that the biological function of circ-LAMP1 is partly attributed to the modulation of miR-615-5p/DDR2 signaling. In summary, these findings documented that circ-LAMP1 might be an oncogene in T-LBL, which might be useful in developing promising therapies for T-LBL.

AB Edwardsiella tarda belongs to the genera of Gram negative bacterium mainly associated with edwardsiellosis, the most commonly found infectious fish disease throughout the globe. E. tarda is also a widespread pathogen which cause infections such as cellulitis or gas gangrene and generalized infections in humans. To control the escalating infection of E. trada on various species, it is essential to decoded the mysterious mechanism behind the bacterial infection at transcript level. In this present study, we carry out a de novo E. tarda Whole transcriptome sequencing, isolated from infected fish intestine using SOLiD sequencing platform. RNA-Seq data analysis was performed using various bioinformatics pipelines. Protein-protein interaction study for pathway enrichment and gene ontology study were executed for further investigation. Assembly statistics for E. tarda dataset showed that the number of transcript contigs was 9657 out of which 6749 were GO annotated whereas 1528 were not assigned any GO terms. GO analysis showed that the expressed genes were enhanced with molecular function, cellular component and biological process. A KEGG enrichment study showed that pathway's that are directly linked with immune diseases like Rheumatoid arthritis (0.2%), Tuberculosis (0.3%) Endocytosis (0.6%) was considerably enriched. Protein-protein interaction study showed that most of the expressed proteins were involved in metabolic pathways, flagellar assembly, Propanoate metabolism, Microbial metabolism in diverse environments, Butanoate metabolism and Carbon. The present study provides novel E. tarda transcriptome sequence data, allowing us to identify biologically significant genes and their functional relationship with fish diseases, and will be useful in recognize the reliable therapeutic targets in near feature.

AB Glial tumors are malignant brain tumors that arise from glial cells of brain or spine and have genetic aberrations in their genome. 1p/19q co-deletion is associated with increased Overall Survival (OS) time with enhanced response to chemo- and radio-therapy in oligodendrogliomas. However, prognostic significance of 1p/19q co-polysomy is still unclear. We evaluated 1p/19q status of 221 patients with glial tumor by Fluorescent in situ Hybridization (FISH). Records of the patients were collected retrospectively. Our results demonstrated that 1p/19q co-polysomy was associated with decreased OS time, high P53 expression and frequently located in temporal lobe, whereas 1p/19q co-deletion was associated with increased overall survival time, low P53 expression and frontal lobe location. Furthermore, classification of patients based on both 1p/19q status and P53 expression revealed that patients with 1p/19q co-polysomy and high P53 expression had the worst prognosis. Lastly, our bioinformatic survival analysis revealed that high expression of SRM, ICMT, and FTL located in 1p36.13-p36.31 and 19q13.2-q13.33 region were related with decreased OS time in patients with Low Grade Glioma (LGG). The study demonstrated that 1p/19q co-polysomy is a poor prognostic marker for glial tumor.

AB Therapeutic inhibition of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) action has emerged as a potential approach for managing several diseases including breast cancer (BC). Genistein has been found to exert anti-malignant activity. However, its mechanisms of action remain unknown. Studies indicate that it could act by downregulating HIF-1 alpha. Based on these findings, we investigated whether genistein could reduce HIF-1 alpha in BC cell lines. Furthermore, we performed molecular docking studies to characterize the sites of interaction between genistein and HIF-1 alpha. In the present investigation, we prove, for the first time, that genistein downregulates HIF-1 alpha in BC cells. Molecular docking analysis also revealed that genistein binds to the FIH-1 binding site of HIF-1 alpha protein. These findings thus indicate that genistein and/or HIF-1 alpha antagonists could be a potential treatment for BC.

AB Genetic variation and differentiation of five ethnic groups from Punjab, North-West India was characterized by analyzing data on polymorphic Alu insertions (POALINs) within the class I genomic region of major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which is completely non-existent in Indian population. The haplotype frequency, distribution and heterozygosity among these groups and their potential implications in molecular anthropology and evolutionary studies were also determined. A total of 479 unrelated healthy individuals representing five different ethnic groups: Banias, Brahmins, Khatri, Jat Sikhs and Scheduled Castes were genotyped for five MHC Alu elements (AluHG, AluMICB, AluHJ, AluTF and AluHF) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All the loci were found to be polymorphic among the studied populations. No significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed, except for the AluHJ locus in Brahmins. The POALINs varied in allele frequency between 0.0260 and 0.4427. The average heterozygosity among the studied groups ranged from 0.1937 in Banias to 0.2666 in Jat Sikhs. The genetic differentiation among the studied groups was observed to be of the order of 0.01302. Single POALIN haplotypes were found to be more frequent than multiple POALIN haplotypes. The results of inter-population differentiations, haplotype frequencies, genetic distances, multidimensional scaling, phylogenetic and structure analyses indicated close genetic relationships between the five ethnic groups of Punjab, North-West India. Analyses of polymorphic Alu loci of MHC genomic region may represent reliable information about the ancestry, demographic history and geographic origins of the various human populations, facilitating better understanding of the evolutionary, forensic and epidemiological prospective.

AB Reducing pathogenic risks in surface waters impacted by leaking or overflowing sewage requires the ability to detect human excreta in raw sewage, discriminate human excreta from other types of animal excreta, and differentiate between treated wastewater and raw sewage. We used the relative concentrations of a degradable, human-specific pharmaceutical and a persistent artificial sweetener to indicate the presence of human excreta, its degree of environmental degradation, and the amount of dilution by freshwater sources. Samples were collected and analyzed for acetaminophen and sucralose between 2016 and 2018 from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and streams in metropolitan Lexington, Kentucky (USA). Both co-analytes were consistently present in raw sewage, with acetaminophen in higher concentrations than sucralose. The presence of acetaminophen was related primarily to untreated human excreta, with concentrations rapidly decreasing upon treatment to nearly undetectable levels in WWTP effluents and streams. Sucralose in surface waters was related to inputs of both raw sewage and WWTP effluents. The ratio of acetaminophen to sucralose concentrations in raw sewage and spiked river waters exhibited linear decay kinetics with respect to time, with larger decay constants observed at higher temperatures. This co-analyte indicator approach was evaluated at a local site previously suspected of receiving raw sewage. The presence and ratios of the co-analytes indicated the presence of domestic sewage that was not fully treated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Due to highly recalcitrant and toxicological nature of halogenated organic compounds, conventional anaerobic dehalogenation is often limited by low removal rate and poor process stability. Besides, the reduction intermediates or products formed during dehalogenation process, which are still toxic, required further energy-intensive aerobic post-treatment. In this study, an up-flow electricity-stimulated anaerobic system (ESAS) was developed by installing cathode underneath and anode above to realize simultaneous anaerobic debromination and mineralization of 4-bromophenol (4-BP). When cathode potential was 600 mV, high TOC removal efficiency (98.78 +/- 0.96%), complete removal of 4-BP and phenol could be achieved at 4-BP loading rate of 0.58 mol m(-3) d(-1), suggesting debrominated product of 4-BP from cathode (i.e., phenol) would be utilized as the fuel by the bioanode of ESAS. Under high 4-BP loading rate (2.32 mol m(-3) d(-1)) and low electron donor dosage (4.88 mM), 4-BP could be completely removed at acetate usage ratio as low as 4.21 +/- 1.42 mol acetate mol(-1) 4-BP removal in ESAS, whereas only 13.45 +/- 1.38% of 4-BP could be removed at acetate usage ratio as high as 31.28 +/- 3.38 mol acetate mol(-1) 4-BP removal in control reactor. Besides, electrical stimulation distinctly facilitated the growth of various autotrophic dehalogenation species, phenol degradation related species, fermentative species, homoacetogens and electrochemically active species in ESAS. Moreover, based on the identified intermediates and the bacterial taxonomic analysis, possible metabolism mechanism involved in enhanced anaerobic debromination and mineralization of 4-BP in ESAS was proposed.

AB Induced bank filtration (IBF) is a water abstraction technology using different natural infiltration systems for groundwater recharge, such as river banks and lake shores. It is a cost-effective pre-treatment method for drinking water production used in many regions worldwide, predominantly in urban areas. Until now, research concerning IBF has almost exclusively focussed on the purification efficiency and infiltration capacity. Consequently, knowledge about the effects on source water bodies is lacking. Yet, IBF interrupts groundwater seepage and affects processes in the sediment potentially resulting in adverse effects on lake or river water quality. Securing sufficient source water quality, however, is important for a sustainable drinking water production by IBF.
   In this study, we analysed the effects of five predicted mechanisms of IBF on shallow lake ecosystems using the dynamic model PCLake: declining CO2 and nutrient availability, as well as increasing summer water temperatures, sedimentation rates and oxygen penetration into sediments. Shallow lake ecosystems are abundant worldwide and characterised by the occurrence of alternative stable states with either clear water and macrophyte dominance or turbid, phytoplankton-dominated conditions. Our results show that IBF in most scenarios increased phytoplankton abundance and thus had adverse effects on shallow lake water quality. Threshold levels for critical nutrient loading inducing regime shifts from clear to turbid conditions were up to 80% lower with IBF indicating a decreased resilience to eutrophication. The effects were strongest when IBF interrupted the seepage of CO2 rich groundwater resulting in lower macrophyte growth. IBF could also enhance water quality, but only when interrupting the seepage of groundwater with high nutrient concentrations. Higher summer water temperatures increased the share of cyanobacteria in the phytoplankton community and thus the risk of toxin production. In relative terms, the effects of changing sedimentation rates and oxygen penetration were small. Lake depth and size influenced the effect of IBF on critical nutrient loads, which was strongest in shallower and smaller lakes. Our model results stress the need of a more comprehensive ecosystem perspective including an assessment of !BF effects on threshold levels for regime shifts to prevent high phytoplankton abundance in the source water body and secure a sustainable drinking water supply.

AB Bisphenol A (BPA) is a semi-persistent environmental endocrine disrupter and widely present in aqueous environments. Electrochemical detection is an effective method to monitor pollutants like BPA in aqueous environments. However, the electrode fouling from anodic polymeric products is one main barrier of electrochemical sensors for their practical applications. In this work, a renewable electrochemical sensor was rationally designed, constructed and tested for efficient BPA detection. The TiO2 anodic material was surface-engineered by inorganic-framework molecular imprinting sites with tailored morphological shape, exposed facet and crystal structure. This electrode could be activated mainly as an electrochemical catalyst and partially as a photochemical catalyst. The developed TiO2-based sensor exhibited a good detection reliability and cyclic stability for determining BPA in water samples, with an electrochemical signal decrease of less than 5.0% in 10-run cyclic tests. By virtue of the bi-functional properties of the tailored TiO2 anodic material, a unique photo-assisted electrochemical sensor was further developed, in which analyte digestion and analytical signal originated mainly from anodic conversion. Such a synergistic digesting mechanism distinguishes it from the reported electroassisted photochemical TiO2 sensors. Our work provides a robust sensor for monitoring pollutants in aqueous environments and a new opportunity to develop renewable electrode materials with good reusability. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Eliminating the sources of human lead exposure is an ongoing public health goal. Identifying the make-up of household plumbing and service line material type is important for many reasons including understanding lead release sources and mechanisms, targeting locations for lead service line (LSL) removal, and assessing the effectiveness of lead remediation strategies. As part of the response to Flint, Michigan's drinking water lead public health crisis, a return to their original drinking water source (Lake Huron) and an increase in orthophosphate dose was implemented in late 2015. In 2016, EPA performed multiple rounds of sequential or "profiling" water sampling to evaluate corrosion control effectiveness and identify lead sources in homes and service lines, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of corrosion control treatment with time on the different plumbing components. The results showed that lead levels, including high lead levels likely associated with particles, decreased with time in homes sampled during the 11-month evaluation period. Although sequential sampling indicated that brass fittings, brass fixtures, and galvanized pipes were lead sources, LSLs were the greatest source of lead when present. Following the removal of LSLs, the total mass of lead contributed to the drinking water decreased by 86% on average. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Treatment processes, such as membrane filtration with reverse osmosis (RU), are used to produce drinking water with a high degree of biostability. To our knowledge, the influence of RO water on biofilm formation and growth of L. pneumophila has not yet been investigated. Therefore, this study aimed (i) to determine the Legionella growth potential of (remineralised) RO-water produced by a pilot plant and to compare this to conventional treated groundwater, and (ii) to determine if different pipe materials, in contact with remineralised RO-water, can cause growth of L. pneumophila. The Legionella growth potential of water was determined with the boiler biofilm monitor (BBM) that mimics the flow of water in a premise plumbing system. The Legionella growth potential of materials in contact with remineralised RO-water was determined by using the biomass production potential (BPP)-test. ATP concentrations in the biofilm on the glass rings from the BBM fed with (remineralised) RO water fluctuated around 100 mu g ATP cm(-2). In contrast, BBM5 fed with conventionally treated water resulted in ten-fold higher ATP concentrations in the biofilm. Moreover, conventionally treated water had a Legionella growth potential that was 1000-fold higher than that of (remineralised) RO-water. Furthermore, glass, copper and PVC-C had the lowest biofilm concentrations and Legionella growth potential in the BPP-test, followed by PE-Xb, PE-Xc and PE-100. The highest biofilm concentration and Legionella growth potential were with PVC-P. Hence, our study demonstrated that remineralised RO-water did not enhance growth of L. pneumophila in the BBM that mimics the premises plumbing system.

AB Frequent off-flavor events caused by geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol have caused concern among consumers about the quality of potable water. Pseudanabaena galeata, a filamentous cyanobacterium, is a known producer of 2-methylisoborneol in lakes and reservoirs. The use of algicides to control cyanobacteria must consider the potential release of contaminants into the water. This is the first study to systematically investigate the effectiveness of copper sulphate (CuSO4), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on the cell viability and integrity of Pseudanabaena galeata. Following algicide or oxidant treatment, the release and degradation of 2-methylisoborneol was also examined. It is evident that all of these chemicals can decrease Pseudanabaena galeata viability and damage cell membranes and the filamentous Pseudanabaena galeata was more susceptible to treatment by these three algicides than unicellular colonial Microcystis aeruginosa. Of the three compounds used, KMnO4 showed the stronger ability to compromise cell integrity and 5.0 mg/L KMnO4 could induce 91 +/- 1.5% lysis of Pseudanabaena galeata within 2 h. It was found that H2O2 had the potential to degrade 2-methylisoborneol with 16.0 +/- 0.4% degraded by 20.0 mg/L H2O2 within 8 h. In contrast, 2-methylisoborneol could not be degraded by CuSO4 (dosage: < 1.5 mg/L; reaction time: < 8 h) and KMnO4 (dosage: < 5.0 mg/L; reaction time: < 3 h) basically. Results showed that the oxidation capacity of H2O2 against Pseudanabaena galeata was enhanced under sunlight. The results will help drinking water utilities to better understand the risk of Pseudanabaena galeata lysis and 2-methylisoborneol release during raw water treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The conversion of food waste (FW) into the sewage system is regarded as a promising method of relieving the burden of solid waste management. However, knowledge about its effects on sewer processes is limited, particularly in terms of biofilm formation and sulfide production. In this study, a gravity sewer system was set up to investigate the effects of the addition of FW on biofilm formation, the sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) population, and the sulfide production potential. The sewer biofilm characteristics changed with long-term FW addition, and a greater thickness (by 32%), an increased dry density (by 13%), and more extracellular polymeric substance (by 141%) were observed. The thicker and denser biofilm limited oxygen diffusion, enlarged the anaerobic area in the sewer biofilm, promoted an increase in the SRB population, and enhanced the sulfide production potential in the gravity sewer. Substantial differences in the H2S profiles in the biofilm samples with and without the addition of FW were observed via microelectrode analysis. A model-based investigation of sewer biofilm formation with and without the addition of FW was conducted with a dynamic sewer biofilm model to gain further insights into sewer biofilm processes. The results suggest that the addition of FW can promote sulfide production and SRB growth in a sewer biofilm, which can be significantly affected by the ratio of FW to sewage. It is worth further investigations of the impacts of FW addition on the potential sulfide production in pressure sewers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aerobic granular sludge (AGS) is a powerful biotechnology to remove various heavy metal(loid)s from wastewater, but not including arsenic (As). In this study, a novel manganese-oxidizing aerobic granular sludge (Mn-AGS) was developed to remove As from organic wastewater. Eight sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) were operated in duplicate to investigate the feasibility of As removal by Mn-AGS. The immobilized As in the granular sludge was characterized by sequencing extraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and Raman spectroscopy. Oxidation pathways for As and their contributions in Mn-AGS were evaluated by seven batch experiments under different conditions. The results indicated that As removal efficiency was much higher by Mn-AGS than by AGS. In Mn-AGS, As(Ill) was efficiently oxidized into As(V) (74.6%-82.6%) and then mostly bound on amorphous ferrihydrite and biogenic Mn oxides (bio-MnOx) (56.2%-65.0%), while metal arsenates, such as ferric arsenate, were not detected. Importantly, As removal was greatly improved by a small addition of Fe(II) in Mn-AGS. This might be primarily caused by Fenton reactions, because this improvement was removed when H2O2, self-generated in Mn-AGS, was scavenged by exogenous catalase (CAT). This study provided a novel extension of the traditional AGS technology to treat As in organic wastewater with an acceptable degree of efficiency. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB National and subnational burden of disease attributable to elevated fluoride levels in drinking water apportioned by sex, age group, province, and community type in Iran, 2017 were quantified based on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The attributable burden of disease was estimated using four input data: (1) effect size of elevated drinking water fluoride levels for dental and skeletal fluorosis, (2) population distribution of drinking water fluoride levels, (3) the threshold levels of fluoride in drinking water for contribution in dental and skeletal fluorosis, and (4) age-sex distribution of population. The attributable burden of disease was only related to dental fluorosis, because the fluoride levels were lower than the threshold value for skeletal fluorosis (4.0 mg/L) in all of the cases. The national attributable prevalence (per 100,000 people), DALYs, and DALY rate in 2017 were calculated to be 60 (95% uncertainty interval 48-69), 3443 (1034-6940), and 4.31 (1.29-8.68), respectively. The national attributable burden of disease was not significantly different by sex, but was affected by age and community type in a manner that the highest DALY rate was related to the age group 10-14 y (6.06 [1.82-12.211) and over 66% of the national attributable DALYs occurred in rural communities. The attributable burden of disease occurred only in 10 out of 31 provinces and about 94% of the attributable DALYs were concentrated in four provinces Fars (1967 [592-3964]), Bushehr (414 [124-8361), West Azarbaijan (400 [120-808]), and Hormozgan (377 [113-7611). Implementation of fluoride-safe drinking water supply schemes in the four leading provinces can prevent most of the national health losses and partly compensate the increasing trend of disease burden from oral conditions at the national level.

AB The development of cost-effective water disinfection methods is highly desired to address the problems caused by outbreak of harmful microorganisms. Sulfate radical (center dot SO4-)-based advanced oxidation technology has attracted increasing attention. However, various catalysts or UV irradiation are usually used to activate persulfate (PS), which is high-cost and the recovery of nano-sized catalysts is also challenging. This work demonstrates a new method of catalyst-free activation of persulfate by visible light (VL) for bacterial inactivation. The 6-log of E. coli cells can be inactivated within 40 min and 7-log of E. coli cells could be inactivated within 120 min by the VL/PS system. The major responsive wavelength is 420 nm, and no heat activation of PS is found during VL irradiation. A synergistic effect with synergy factor of 51.2% is found when combining the VL irradiation with heating at 50 degrees C. The acidic pH is benefit for the VL/PS-triggered bacterial inactivation, while bicarbonate inhibits the E. coli inactivation at the range of 0.1-20 mg/L. Mechanism study indicates the main reactive species are.center dot SO4-, center dot O-2(-) and center dot OH, in which center dot SO4- plays the most important role. The bacterial inactivation process shows to begin from outer membrane to intracellular components. Subsequently, the antioxidant enzyme (i.e. SOD, CAT) is induced, followed by damaging to the genomic DNA leading to fatal death of the cells. In addition, the VL/PS system is also applicable for the inactivation of other pathogenic bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, showing universality for water disinfection applications. This work not only provides a new cost-effective disinfection method without a catalyst, but also sheds light on understanding the bacterial inactivation mechanism by center dot SO4- based AOPs.

AB Marine phytoplankton accounts for roughly half the planetary primary production, and plays significant roles in marine ecosystem functioning, physical and biogeochemical processes, and climate changes. Documenting phytoplankton assemblages' dynamics, particularly their community structure properties, is thus a crucial and also challenging task. A large number of in situ and space-borne observation datasets are collected that cover the marginal seas in the west Pacific, including Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea. Here, a customized region-specific semi-analytical model is developed in order to detect phytoplankton community structure properties (using phytoplankton size classes, PSCs, as its first-order delegate), and repeatedly tested to assure its reliable performance. Independent in situ validation datasets generate relatively low and acceptable predictive errors (e.g., mean absolute percentage errors, MAPE, are 38.4%, 22.7%, and 34.4% for micro-, nano-, and picophytoplankton estimations, respectively). Satellite synchronization verification also produces comparative predictive errors. By applying this model to long time-series of satellite data, we document the past two-decadal (namely from 1997 to 2017) variation on the PSCs. Satellite-derived records reveal a general spatial distribution rule, namely microphytoplankton accounts for most variation in nearshore regions, when nanophytoplankton dominates offshore water areas, together with a certain high contribution from picophytoplankton. Long time-series of data records indicate a roughly stable tendency during the period of the past twenty years, while there exist periodical changes in a short-term one-year scale. High covariation between marine environment factors and PSCs are further found, with results that underwater light field and sea surface temperature are the two dominant climate variables which exhibit a good ability to multivariate statistically model the PSCs changes in these marginal seas. Specifically, three types of influence induced by underwater light field and sea surface temperature can be generalized to cover different water conditions and regions, and meanwhile a swift response time (approximately < 1 month) of phytoplankton to the changing external environment conditions is found by the wavelet analysis. This study concludes that phytoplankton community structures in the marginal seas remain stable and are year-independent over the past two decades, together with a short-term in-year cycle; this change rule need to be considered in future oceanographic studies.

AB Many current treatments for brine wastewaters are energy-intensive, chemical-intensive, and involve independent process in the removal of salts and contaminants. We demonstrate that through the integration of capacitive deionization and photocatalysis reactions within carbon nanotubes (CNTs) based membrane system, we are able to realize the purification and desalination of wastewaters via single-step, energy-efficient, and environmentally friendly route. We firstly designed the membrane system consisting of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), CNTs membrane, and poly(vinyl alcohol)-formaldehyde (PVF) foam. Then, two identical membrane systems were used as permeable electrodes and photocatalytic microreactors to construct the flow-through setup. The tests of the setup with a variety of dye solution, antibiotics solution, and actual wastewaters prove that wastewaters passing through the setup promptly turn to clean water with significantly decreased salinity. This is because the setup can use C3N4 modified CNTs membrane to adsorb organic contaminants and inorganic ions and decompose contaminants via photocatalysis reactions. In addition, by discharging the setup, its adsorption capacity towards salts is easily recovered. Consequently, the flow-through setup is observed to exhibit stable performance for concurrent removal of organic contaminants and inorganic salts in multiple cycles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Iron (Fe)-based chemically enhanced primary sedimentation (CEPS) is an effective process used to remove organic and phosphorus (P) pollutants from wastewater into sludge. In this study, electrofermentation (EF) technology was developed to treat the organic- and P-rich Fe-sludge for the purposes of sludge reduction and resource recovery. Using a two-chamber bioreactor with a cation exchange membrane and an exterior voltage (0.5-1.0 V) for sludge treatment, the EF system enabled product accumulation and separation during the fermentation process. Compared with the conventional fermentation in a single-chamber reactor, the EF treatment of Fe-sludge significantly improved the efficiency of P dissolution from the sludge from 8% to 56% after 4 d. Meanwhile, about 70% of released ammonium ions and 50% of Fe in the sludge were driven by the current from the sludge suspension into the cathode chamber for potential recovery. With a similar yield of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) but less ammonium remaining, the CODvFA/NNH4 of the sludge supernatant from the EF reactor could reach 67.7, much higher than that from the single-chamber fermenter at 13.0. The protease activity was effectively promoted by the EF treatment, suggesting that both electrochemical and biological hydrolysis effects contributed to the increased P release from the sludge. Microbial community analysis showed that the electrical stimulation increased the relative abundance of Firmicutes and facilitated the growth of Acidobacteria. Overall, electro-fermentation was developed as an effective biotechnology for processing Fe-based CEPS sludge with the benefits of recovering organics, phosphorus, ammonium and iron resources.

AB A new hybrid system was developed in this study for the treatment of drinking water consisting of pre coagulation using polyaluminium chloride (PACT) and membrane filtration (MF) with sponge cubes acting as biomass carriers (P-SMF). When compared to a conventional MF (CMF) and a MF after coagulation by utilizing PACT (P-MF), better removal of nutrients, UV254 and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (>65%) was obtained from the P-SMF. The accumulation of biopolymers (including polysaccharides and proteins), humic substances, hydrophilic organics, and other small molecular weight (MW) organic matter in the CMF led to the most severe membrane fouling coupled with the highest pore blocking and cake resistance. Pre-coagulation was ineffective in eliminating small MW and hydrophilic organic matter. Conversely, the larger MW organics (i.e. biopolymers and humic substances), small MW organics and hydrophilic organic compounds could be removed in significantly larger quantities in the P-SMF by PACT coagulation. This was achieved via adsorption and the biodegradation by attached biomass on these sponges and by the suspended sludge. Further analyses of the microbial community indicated that the combined addition of PACl and sponges generated a high enrichment of Zoolgloea, Amaricoccus and Reyranella leading to the reduction of biopolymers, and Flexibacter and Sphingobium were linked to the degradation of humic substances. Moreover, some members of Alphaproteobacteria in the P-SMF may be responsible for the removal of low MW organics. These results suggest that the pre-coagulation process coupled with adding sponge in the MF system is a promising technology for mitigating membrane fouling. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A method for operating membrane capacitive deionization (MCDI) systems without electrode reactions at a high cell potential was studied. The charge supplied to the cell was controlled to suppress Faradaic reactions. The maximum allowable charge (MAC) that can be supplied to a carbon electrode without electrode reactions was measured to be 58 C/g. Adsorption experiments were conducted while supplying a charge of 55 C/g (95% of the MAC value) in constant-current (CC) and constant-voltage (CV) mode. The cell potential increased to 1.42 V in CC (1.43-4.29 mAicm(2)) mode, but the concentration and pH of the effluent were kept constant. In addition, the effluent pH was stable in CV (1.25-2.0V) mode. The salt adsorption capacities and charge efficiencies were approximately 15.5 mg/g and 92%, respectively, regardless of the current densities and cell potentials applied to the cell. With increasing cell potential, the concentration polarization in the feed stream was intensified, resulting in an increase in cell resistance. It was thought that electrode reactions did not occur at a high cell potential because of the high voltage drop due to the cell resistance. The higher the cell potential (or current density) is, the faster the desalination rate in MCDI operation. It is expected that this operation method applying the MAC concept will contribute to the stable operation of MCDI systems and an improvement in desalination performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The rheological behavior is known to be of great interest in sludge treatment, but the material complexity induces strong measurement difficulties. The literature highlights two characteristics deeply impacting sludge rheological properties and their characterization: Thixotropic behavior and organic matter (Seyssiecq et al., 2003; Eshtiaghi et al., 2013), both being related to each other. Indeed, by looking at how thixotropy affects elastic modulus and yield stress with different mechanical histories at different organic matter ratios, it turns out that the higher the organic matter, the higher the thixotropic behavior.

AB The objective of this work was to develop a Q$BR model for the prioritization of organic pollutants based on biodegradation rates from a database containing globally harmonized biodegradation tests using relevant molecular descriptors. To do this, we first categorized the chemicals into three groups (Group 1: simple aromatic chemicals with a single ring, Group 2: aromatic chemicals with multiple rings and Group3: Group 1 plus Group 2) based on molecular descriptors, estimated the first order biodegradation rate of the chemicals using rating values derived from the BIOWIN3 model, and finally developed, validated and defined the applicability domain of models for each group using a multiple linear regression approach. All the developed Q$BR models complied with OECD principles for QSAR validation. The biodegradation rate in the models for the two groups (Group 2 and 3 chemicals) are associated with abstract molecular descriptors that provide little relevant practical information towards understanding the relationship between chemical structure and biodegradation rates. However, molecular descriptors associated with the QSBR model for Group 1 chemicals (R-2 = 0.89, Q(100)(2) = 0.87) provided information on properties that can readily be scrutinised and interpreted in relation to biodegradation processes. In combination, these results lead to the conclusion that QSBRs can be an alternative tool to estimate the persistence of chemicals, some of which can provide further insights into those factors affecting biodegradation.

AB In this study, indirect electrochemical reduction with zero-valent titanium (ZVT) as anode successfully achieved the selective nitrate removal from simulated groundwater. The maximum nitrate removal efficiency and N-2 selectivity reached to 83.4% and 78.5% after 12 h, respectively. Experimental results demonstrated that the gaseous by-products (NO and N2O) were negligible and the nitrate reduction process could be well depicted by pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Decreasing the pH value of electrolyte was favorable to electrical energy utilization efficiency and nitrate removal. The chloride ultimately showed inhibitory effects on electrochemical reduction of nitrate. During the electrochemical reaction, the ZVT lost electrons to generate the reducing agents (Ti3+ and Ti2+), which could afford electrons for nitrate reduction and form the solid by-products TiO2.4Cl0.2N0.1. A 2-stage strategy, indirect electrochemical reduction + hypochlorite treatment (pre-reduction + post-oxidation), was developed to completely remove nitrate and the long-term performance of nitrate reduction was comprehensively evaluated. The effluent nitrate steadily kept at 8.8 mg N/L during 120 h continuous operation when the influent nitrate concentration was 25.9 mg N/L Simultaneously, nitrite concentration was lower than 0.01 mg NIL, and ammonium and Ti ions were not detected in the effluent.

AB Biofilm structure and functionality depend on extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), but analytical methods for EPS often lack specificity which limits progress of biofilm research.
   EPS were extracted from aerobic granular sludge and analyzed with frequently applied colorimetric methods. The colorimetric methods were evaluated based on their applicability for EPS analysis. EPS fractions of interest were proteins, sugars, uronic acids and phenolic compounds. The applied methods (Lowry method, bicinchoninic acid assay, phenol sulfuric acid method, carbazole sulfuric acid method) were investigated in terms of their sensitivity towards the selected standard compound. Interference of compounds present in EPS with the colorimetric methods was further evaluated. All methods showed to be highly depending on the choice of standard compound and susceptible towards interference by compounds present in EPS.
   This study shows that currently used colorimetric methods are not capable of accurately characterizing EPS. More advanced methods are needed to be able to draw conclusions about biofilm composition, structure and functionality. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The formation of chlorinated by-products is a major concern associated with electrochemical water treatment processes. This study investigated the formation of chlorinated by-products during surface water treatment by a newly developed electrochemical advanced oxidation process (EAOP), the electroperoxone (E-peroxone) process, which couples ozonation with in situ electro-generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from cathodic oxygen reduction. Due to the enhanced ozone (03) conversion to hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) by electro-generated H2O2, the E-peroxone process considerably accelerated the abatement of ozone-refractory micropollutants such as clofibric acid and chloramphenicol in the selected surface water compared to conventional ozonation. In addition, the cathodically generated H2O2 effectively quenched hypochlorous acid (HOCl) derived from the anodic oxidation of chloride in the surface water. Therefore, the formation of trichloromethane (TCM) and chloroacetic acids (CAAs) from the reactions of HOCl with dissolved organic matter (DOM) was insignificant during the E-peroxone process, and similar levels of TCM and CAAs were generally observed in the conventional ozonation and E-peroxone treated water. In contrast, considerable amounts of HOCl could be generated from the anodic oxidation of chloride and then accumulated in the surface water during conventional electrolysis process, which resulted in significantly higher concentrations of TCM and CAAs in the electrolysis treated water. The results of this study suggest that the E-peroxone process can overcome the major limitation of conventional electrochemical processes and provide an effective and safe EAOP alternative for micro pollutant abatement during water treatment.

AB Ultraviolet light-emitting diode (UV-LED) is a newly emerging UV light source with a potential to replace the conventional chemical methods, mercury UV lamps and xenon lamps in water disinfection. UV-LEDs are characterized by the diversity in wavelengths and can be turned on and off with a high and adjustable frequency, making them an attractive candidate for pulsed light (PL) disinfection apart from the conventional continuous wave (CW) operation. Previous studies on comparison between the PL and CW UV LED irradiations for the inactivation of bacterium in water disinfection are limited and results conflict. In this work, PL and CW UV-LED in the C-spectral band (UVC-LED) irradiations were compared at equivalent fluence in the inactivation and subsequent photoreactivation of E. coli bacteria. In addition, effect of different driving currents and ambient temperatures on solder temperature of the PL and CW UVC-LED irradiation was also examined. Under the equivalent fluences, the PL and CW UVC-LED irradiations brought comparable inactivation efficiency and similar photoreactivation of the E. coli. Moreover, the PL UVC-LED exhibited a much lower solder temperature than the CW UVC-LED irradiation. On the other hand, CW UVC-LED irradiation, higher ambient temperature and higher driving current increased the solder temperature that resulted to a negative impact on the wavelength, full width at half maximum, optical power and irradiance, which are key factors in the UVC-LED disinfection efficiency. In all, this work reports the comparison between PL and CW in UVC-LED irradiation for inactivating E. coli bacteria and firstly revealed the photoreactivation of the E. coli after the PL UVC-LEDs irradiation.

AB Microplastics (MPs) as new pollutants of environmental concern have been widely detected in sewage sludge, and may act as significant vectors for metal pollutants due to their adsorption property. Our findings show that Cd, Pb, and Co, but not Ni, contents in sewage sludge are lower than that of corresponding metal irons adsorbed on sludge-based MPs, indicating that the MPs accumulate such metal pollutants as Cd in the sludge samples. In contrast to virgin MPs, sludge-based MPs are one order of magnitude higher adsorption capacity for Cd, which reaches up to 2.523 mg g(-1), implying that there is a considerable enhancement in adsorption potential of the MPs for metals after the wastewater treatment process. SEM analysis shows that sludge-based MPs have rougher and more porous surface than virgin MPs, and FTIR spectra reveal that functional groups such as C-O and O-H are found on sludge-based MPs. Further, two-dimensional FTIR correlation spectroscopy indicates that C-O and N-H functional groups play a vital role in the process that sludge-based MPs adsorb Cd, which are not found in virgin MPs. The results imply that increased adsorption potentials of the sludge-based MPs to Cd are attributed to changes in the MP physicochemical properties during wastewater treatment process. In addition, such factors as pH value, and sludge inorganic and organic components also have an effect on the MP adsorption to Cd. Principal component analysis shows that the MPs could be divided into three categories, i.e. polyamide, rubbery MPs (polyethylene and polypropylene) and glassy MPs (polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene). Their adsorption potentials to Cd follow the decreasing order: polyamide > rubbery MPs > glassy MPs. In summary, these findings indicate that MPs may exert an important influence on fate and transport of metal pollutants during sewage sludge treatment process, which deserves to be further concerned.

AB A simple, transparent and reliable method for evaluating non-point source pollution (NPSP) risks to drinking water source areas lacking observational data is proposed herein. The NPSP risks are assessed by using nutrient budget models for total nitrogen and total phosphorus, making the best use of remote sensing and field survey data. We demonstrate its potential using a case study of the Chaihe Reservoir in northeastern China. Fertilizer inputs and crop-uptake outputs were estimated based on normalized difference vegetation index, which is derived from remote sensing as indicators of crop growth and production. The nutrient balances for this area showed surpluses of both N and P within the soil system. Estimated imbalances per unit area were consistent with statistical relationships derived from all Chinese counties, demonstrating that the proposed method is reliable. The surplus P amounts were higher than the standard threshold for NPSP risks, indicating the existence of a potential contamination risk of P to this drinking water source. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Effluents containing disinfection byproducts (DBPs) from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) may be discharged to the receiving water bodies or reused for irrigation, landscaping, and environmental supplies as well as a source to replenish groundwater. Thus the formation and risk of the DBPs in disinfected wastewater effluents should be concerned. In this study, the occurrence of 44 DBPs including 6 tri-halomethanes (THMs), 9 haloaceticacids (HAAs), 2 haloketones (HKs), 9 halonitromethanes (HNMs), 9 haloacetonitriles (HANs) and 9 nitrosamines (NAs) was investigated in 12 chlorinated WWTP effluents from five cities of East China. The contribution of each class of DBPs to the total DBPs concentration and additive toxicity was calculated. The average concentrations of the 6 classes of DBPs were ranked as follows: HAAs (47.0 mu g) > THMs (28.0 mu g/L) > HANs (9.9 mu g/L) > HNMs (2.9 mu g) > HKs (0.79 mu g/L) > NAs (0.69 mu g/L). The significant positive correlations were observed between the formation of THMs and HAAs, THMs and HANs, as well as HAAs and HANs. The results showed that HAAs and THMs were the dominant DBPs on a mass concentration basis and accounted for 54% and 29%, respectively in the total measured DBPs, but they made a minor contribution to the calculated DBP-associated cytotoxicity. HANs and NAs dominated the DBP-associated cytotoxicity, accounting for 50% and 34% on an additive toxicity basis despite the minor contributions to the mass concentration with 10% and 1%, respectively. The risk quotients for three taxonomic groups (fish, daphnid, and green algae) were calculated to assess the ecological risk of DBPs, and the results demonstrated that both HAAs and HANs had high ecological risk for green algae in chlorinated wastewater effluents.

AB High-frequency sensor measurements enable calculation of continuous autotrophic nitrate uptake rate based on its intrinsic relationship with gross primary production (GPP). The spatiotemporally available data offer prospects to advance process understandings across scales. We used continuous 15-min data (2011-2015) from a forest upstream reach and an agricultural downstream reach of the Selke River, Germany. Based on the high-frequency data, we developed a parsimonious approach for regionalizing the autotrophic uptake rate, considering effects of global radiation and riparian shading. For networked modeling, we integrated this approach into the fully distributed mesoscale hydrological nitrate model (mHM-Nitrate). Daily GPP-based uptake rate calculations showed distinct seasonal patterns and ranges in the agricultural and forest streams (mean values were 80.9 and 15.5 mg N m(-2) d(-1)., respectively). Validation in the two streams showed acceptable performance (R-2 = 0.47 and 0.45, respectively) and spatial transferability of the regionalization approach, given its parsimony. Networked modeling results showed high spatiotemporal variability in nitrate transport and uptake throughout the river network. The magnitude of gross uptake increased, whereas uptake efficiency decreased significantly along stream order. Longitudinal analysis in the main stem of the Selke River revealed that riparian shading and inter annual hydrochemical variations strongly influenced daily dynamics of the uptake efficiency. This study provides a parsimonious and transferable procedure for regionalizing in-stream autotrophic nitrate uptake based on high-frequency data at reach scale. Integrating this approach in the mHM-Nitrate model allows detailed nitrate transport and in-stream uptake processes to be investigated throughout river networks. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB High arsenic-containing waste acid from the heavy nonferrous metallurgical sector (Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Sn, etc.), one of the most dangerous arsenic hazardous wastes with extremely high arsenic concentrations, has presented enormous challenges to the environment and caused severe environmental pollution over the past few decades due to the lack of affordable and environmentally friendly disposal technologies. Here, we report a green process for the self-enhanced and efficient removal of arsenic from waste acid using magnetite as an in situ iron donator. Firstly, the room-temperature predissolution of magnetite in waste acid provides initial iron ions as a starting precipitator of arsenic, simultaneously providing a suitable pH range and an active surface that are ready for the nucleation and growth of scorodite. Afterwards, arsenic is precipitated in form the of scorodite, which is driven by a mutually improved cycle composed of arsenic precipitation and magnetite dissolution on the surface of magnetite particles. This cycle creates a low supersaturation of iron and constant pH in the waste acid, ensuring the continuous precipitation of arsenic as well-crystallized and environmentally stable scorodite by using magnetite as an in situ iron donator via the reaction of 2Fe(3)O(4) + 6H(3)AsO(4) + H2O2 = 6FeAsO(4) + 10H(2)O. Under optimal conditions, including a 6-h room-temperature predissolution, a 12-h atmospheric reaction at 90 degrees C and a pH of 2.0 with a magnetite dosage at the Fe3O4/As molar ratio (the molar ratio of Fe3O4 in magnetite to As in waste acid) of 1.33, 99.90% of arsenic was successively removed from waste acid with an initial arsenic concentration of 10300 mg/L. In combination with the good adaptability of this process, the performed case study and prospective process show the successful removal of arsenic from waste acid as well as great potential for large-scale applications.

AB Vinyl chloride (VC) is a common groundwater contaminant and known human carcinogen. Three major bacterial guilds are known to participate in VC biodegradation: aerobic etheneotrophs and methanotrophs, and anaerobic organohalide-respiring VC-dechlorinators. We investigated the spatial relationships between functional genes representing these three groups of bacteria (as determined by qPCR) with chlorinated ethene concentrations in a surficial aquifer at a contaminated site. We used cryogenic soil coring to collect high-resolution aquifer sediment samples and to preserve sample geochemistry and nucleic acids under field conditions. All samples appeared to be anaerobic (i.e., contained little to no dissolved oxygen). VC biodegradation associated functional genes from etheneotrophs (etnC and/or etnE), methanotrophs (mrnoX and/or pmoA), and anaerobic VC-dechlorinators (bvcA and/or vcrA) coexisted in 48% of the samples. Transcripts of etnC/etnE and bvcA/vcrA were quantified in contemporaneous groundwater samples, indicating co-located gene expression. Functional genes from etheneotrophs and anaerobic VC-dechlorinators were correlated to VC concentrations in the lower surficial aquifer (p < 0.05). Methanotroph functional genes were not correlated to VC concentrations. Cryogenic soil coring proved to be a powerful tool for capturing high-spatial resolution trends in geochemical and nucleic acid data in aquifer sediments. We conclude that both aerobic etheneotrophs and anaerobic VC-dechlorinators may play a significant role in VC biodegradation in aquifers that have little dissolved oxygen. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nitrochlorobenzene compounds (NCBs) are of key interest in environmental monitoring due to their high toxicity. To better understand the presence and fate of NCBs in aquatic environments, an in-situ sampling technique of diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) based on hydrophilic-lipophilic-balanced (HLB) resin, combined with gas chromatography, was developed to measure four typical NCBs, e.g. meta-chloronitrobenzene (MNCB), para-chloronitrobenzene (PNCB), ortho-chloronitrobenzene (ONCB), and 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (CDNB). The diffusion coefficients of MNCB, PNCB, ONCB, and CDNB in agarose-based gel were firstly determined in diffusion cell experiments and ranged from 7.19 x 10(-6) to 7.49 x 10(-6) cm/s. The capacities of HLB-DGT for MNCB, PNCB, ONCB, and CDNB were higher than 114.65, 117.52, 117.72, and 37.58 mu g/cm(2), respectively. The HLB-DGT performance on NCBs determination was demonstrated to be independent of natural fluctuations in pH (3-9), ionic strength (0.001-0.5 M), and dissolved organic matter concentrations (0-20 mg/L) and of deployment time (0-120 h). In the field application, the DGT-based method to measure NCBs not only proved to be accurate and effective, but also performed better than the grab sampling method under the variable conditions. This study demonstrates that the newly developed in-situ method based on DGT can provide an attractive alternative for the routine monitoring of NCBs in aquatic environments.

AB Peroxides are widely used as crosslinkers in polyethylene (PE) drinking water pipes. Cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) has better mechanical properties than PE, but peroxide decomposition by-products can migrate from PEX water pipes into the drinking water unless sufficient preventive actions are undertaken. This work systematically examines the migration of tert-Butyl methyl ether (MTBE), a dominating crosslinking by-product from PEX water pipes, into tap water by utilizing both experimental techniques and finite element (FEM) diffusion modeling. The effects of pipe geometry, tap water temperature (23-80 degrees C), boundary conditions (air or water interface) and degasing (at 180 degrees C) were considered. The MTBE diffusivity increased strongly with increasing temperature and it was concluded that a desired water quality can be achieved with proper degasing of the PEX pipes. As the FEM simulations were in excellent agreement with the experimental results, the model can accurately predict the MTBE concentration as a function of time, water temperature and PEX pipe geometry, and enable the pipe manufacturers to aid in ensuring desirable drinking water quality.

ID CHOICE EXPERIMENTS; VALUATION
AB Water sensitive urban design is being promoted in many countries. In Singapore, the Active, Beautiful, Clean (ABC) Waters Programme is a long-term strategic initiative of PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency, to improve the quality of water and urban liveability. While there are some estimates of the biophysical and ecological benefits of the ABC Waters Programme, information on its social or non-market values is lacking. Using choice experiment datasets this study explores whether people express preferences for ABC Waters features. It also examines whether there is any difference in preferences between respondents living in developments with and without ABC Waters certification, and between respondents living in public and private housing. It is found that respondents living in private housing have substantially higher willingness to pay for ABC Waters features compared to the respondents in public housing. The differences between respondents from certified and non-certified projects were found to be mixed. Such information would be useful to tailor the design of the ABC Waters program. Finally, the potential impact of using a virtual reality tool to present information in a choice experiment towards people's preferences is explored. Application of a virtual reality tool has reduced the proportion of protest voters and increased people's willingness to pay for ABC Waters projects. Thus, this paper contributes to the growing literature on the implications of providing information visually in non-market valuation surveys. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Mechanical aeration is commonly used to improve the overall treatment efficacy of constructed wetlands. However, the quantitative relationships of air flow rate (AFR), water temperature, field oxygen transfer and treatment performance have not been analyzed in detail until today. In this study, a reactive transport model based on dual-permeability flow and biokinetic formulations of the Constructed Wetland Model No.1 (CWM1) was developed and extented to 1) simulate oxygen transfer and treatment performance for organic carbon and nitrogen of two pilot-scale horizontal flow (HF) aerated wetlands (Test and Control) treating domestic sewage, and, 2) to investigate the dependence of oxygen transfer and treatment performance on AFR and water temperature. Both pilot-scale wetlands exhibited preferential flow patters and high treatment performance for chemical oxygen demand (COD) and NH4-N at AFRs of 128-700 L m(-2) h(-1). A reduction of the AFR in the Test system from 128 to 72 L h(-1) m(-2) substantially inhibited NH4-N removal. Conservative tracer transport as well as reactive transport of dissolved oxygen (DO), soluble and total chemical oxygen demand (CODs, CODt), NH4-N and NOx-N measured in pilot-scale experiments were simulated with acceptable accuracy ((E-1) over bar = 0.39 +/- 0.26). An equation to estimate the volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient was found to be: k(La,20) = 0.511 In(AFR). Simulated treatment performance depended on k(La,20) in a non-linear manner. A local sensitivity analysis of the calibrated parameters revealed porosity, hydraulic permeability and dispersion length of the fast flow field as well as k(La,20) as most important. An optimal AFR for a spatially and temporally continuous aeration pattern for treatment wetlands treating similar influent was estimated to 150-200 L h(-1) m(-2). This study provides insights into aeration mechanisms of aerated treatment wetlands and highlights the benefits of process modeling for in-depth system analysis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Poroelastic fluid-structure interaction models were coupled to experimental data to determine the effects of biofilm spatial distribution of mechanical and hydraulic properties on the biofilm hydraulic resistance and compressibility in membrane filtration processes. Biofilms were cultivated on ultrafiltration membranes for 20 and 30 days under high (0.28 bar) and low (0.06 bar) transmembrane pressure (TMP), in dead-end filtration mode. Subsequently, biofilms were subjected to a compression/relaxation cycles by step-wise TMP changes. Structural deformation of biofilms during compression was observed in-situ using optical coherence tomography.
   Experimental results show that the observed increase in the biofilm hydraulic resistance during compression is not necessarily accompanied by a detectable biofilm thickness reduction. A dual-layer biofilm model with a dense base and porous top layer could explain these observed results. Because porosity controls indirectly the mechanical response of biofilms under compression, results could be described without assuming a gradient in mechanical properties within the biofilm. The biofilm surface roughness did not significantly influence the water flux in this study. However, the fraction of biofilm base layer directly exposed to bulk liquid could be a good indicator in the determination of water flux. The main implications of this study for the design and operation of low-pressure membrane systems (e.g., MF and UF with fouling layer being the main filtration resistance) lays in the selection of favorable operational TMP and biofilm morphology.

AB Polyphosphate (poly-P) is a major constituent in activated sludge from wastewater treatment plants with enhanced biological phosphorus removal due to poly-P synthesis by poly-P accumulating organisms where it plays an important role for recovery of phosphorus from waste water. Our aim was to develop a reliable protocol for poly-P quantification by P-31 NMR spectroscopy. This has so far been complicated by the risks of inefficient extraction and poly-P hydrolysis in the extracts. A protocol for complete extraction, identification and quantification of poly-P in activated sludge from a waste water treatment plant was identified based on test and evaluation of existing extraction protocols in combination with poly-P determination and quantification by solution and solid state P-31 NMR spectroscopy. The total poly-P middle group content was quantified by solid state NMR for comparison with the poly-P middle groups quantified by solution NMR, which is novel. Three different extraction protocols previously used in literature were compared: 1) a single 0.25 M NaOH-0.05 M EDTA extraction, 2) a 0.05 M EDTA pre-extraction followed by a 0.25 M NaOH main extraction and 3) a 0.05 M EDTA pre-extraction followed by a 0.25 M NaOH-0.05 M EDTA main extraction. The results showed that the extraction protocol 2 was optimal for fresh activated sludge, extracting 10.8 +/- 0.4 to 11.4 +/- 1.2 mgP/gDW poly-P. Extraction protocols 1 and 3 extracted less than 9.4 +/- 0.5 mgP/gDW poly-P. A comparison of the quantification of poly-P by P-31 solution NMR and by P-31 solid state NMR spectroscopy of lyophilised activated sludge showed 86 +/- 9% extraction efficiency of poly-P, which confirms that the extraction protocol recovered most of the poly-P from the samples without pronounced poly-P degradation.

AB Enteric viruses pose the greatest acute human health risks associated with subsurface drinking water supplies, yet quantitative risk assessment tools have rarely been used to develop health-based targets for virus treatment in drinking water sourced from these supplies. Such efforts have previously been hampered by a lack of consensus concerning a suitable viral reference pathogen and dose-response model as well as difficulties in quantifying pathogenic viruses in water. A reverse quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) framework and quantitative polymerase chain reaction data for norovirus genogroup I in subsurface drinking water supplies were used herein to evaluate treatment needs for such water supplies. Norovirus was not detected in over 90% of samples, which emphasizes the need to consider the spatially and/or temporally intermittent patterns of enteric pathogen contamination in subsurface water supplies. Collectively, this analysis reinforces existing recommendations that a minimum 4-log treatment goal is needed for enteric viruses in groundwater in absence of well-specific monitoring information. This result is sensitive to the virus dose-response model used as there is approximately a 3-log discrepancy among virus dose-response models in the existing literature. This emphasizes the need to address the uncertainties and lack of consensus related to various QMRA modelling approaches and the analytical limitations that preclude more accurate description of virus risks.

AB The uncontrolled introduction into the environment of plastic polymers have caused the dispersion of plastic fragments, known as Microplastics (MPs), that represent an important topic for public health. This study was the first to investigate the cause of the release of MPs in mineral waters and to estimate the concentration of MPs smaller than 10 mu m both in number of particles and in mass unit. This study was carried out using a patent method regarding the extraction and analysis of MPs in more kind of matrix. Therefore, aims of this study were a) to assess the number of MPs with diameters of between 0.5 and 10 mu m in mineral waters contained in plastic bottles, b) to evaluate if the physical-chemical properties of mineral waters and bottle quality could influence the release of MPs and, finally, c) to estimate the human daily exposure to MPs due to mineral water consumption.
   The Mps were found in every sample. The main concentration of MPs was 656.8 mu g/L +/- 632.9 or 5.42E+07 p/L +/- 1.95E+07. The main diameter of detected MPs was 2.44 mu m +/- 0.66 (where p/L, where p was the number of MPs). The Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) for adults and children were 1,531,524 p/kg/ body-weight/day corresponding to 40.1 mu g/kg/body-weight/day and 3,350,208 p/kg/body-weight/day corresponding to 87.8 mu g/kg/body-weight/day, respectively.
   The number of MPs contamination in bottled mineral waters was strongly correlated to the pH of waters and to plastic density of bottle. Otherwise, micrograms of MPs per liter and the MPs diameters were strongly affected by plastic thickness. The most mineral water brand contaminated by MPs was the one whose bottles were made from poor quality plastic.
   In absence of reference values, it was no possible carried out a risk assessment for MPs exposure. It is fundamental to establish the reference method of analysis to monitoring every source of human intake. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Among natural organic matter (NOM), oxyanions and metal (hydr)oxides, a complicated interaction exists in natural aquatic and terrestrial systems and in waste waters. Effects of seven types of NOM (four humic acids (HA), three fulvic acids (FA)) that vary in properties on the adsorption of oxyanions, including phosphate, arsenate and arsenite, at goethite-water interface were quantitatively studied. Results show that the adsorption of oxyanions to goethite is decreased by the presence of NOM, especially for phosphate and arsenate at low pH. In general, the effects of the three FA are similar, which are more effective than HA in reducing oxyanion adsorption at low pH (<6). Differences were observed between the four HA in their competition with oxyanions. The adsorption of phosphate, arsenate and arsenite in the presence of NOM are well described with both the NOM-CD (CD: Charge Distribution) and LCD (Ligand and Charge Distribution) model. The NOM-CD model is relatively simple to use, whereas the LCD model can better reveal different factors in the interaction, including the spatial distribution of adsorbed NOM on oxide surface. According to these two models: site density of carboxylic groups, protonation constant of carboxylic groups, and particle size of NOM are major properties of NOM determining its effect on oxyanion adsorption to oxides. At relatively low loadings, morphological change of adsorbed NOM takes place, and the degree of morphological change of adsorbed NOM depends on the particle size, site density of carboxylic groups and aromaticity of NOM. The influence of particle size on the interaction becomes more important at higher NOM loadings. The results suggested that the fixation or removal efficiency of phosphate, arsenate and arsenite with iron oxides (e.g. goethite) can be significantly decreased by the presence of NOM, especially when NOM rich in acidic and aromatic groups.

AB Marine sediments represent an important sink of harmful petroleum hydrocarbons after an accidental oil spill. Electrobioremediation techniques, which combine electrokinetic transport and biodegradation processes, represent an emerging technological platform for a sustainable remediation of contaminated sediments. Here, we describe the results of a long-term mesocosm-scale electrobioremediation experiment for the treatment of marine sediments contaminated by crude oil. A dimensionally stable anode and a stainless-steel mesh cathode were employed to drive seawater electrolysis at a fixed current density of 11 A/m(2). This approach allowed establishing conditions conducive to contaminants biodegradation, as confirmed by the enrichment of Alcanivorax borkumensis cells harboring the alkB-gene and other aerobic hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria. Oil chemistry analyses indicated that aromatic hydrocarbons were primarily removed from the sediment via electroosmosis and low molecular weight alkanes (nC(6) to nC(10)) via biodegradation.

AB Recent findings show that a subset of bacteria affiliated with Nitrospira, a genus known for its importance in nitrite oxidation for biological nutrient removal applications, are capable of complete ammonia oxidation (comammox) to nitrate. Early reports suggested that they were absent or present in low abundance in most activated sludge processes, and thus likely functionally irrelevant. Here we show the accumulation of comammox Nitrospira in a nitrifying sequencing batch reactor operated at low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. Actual mainstream wastewater was used as influent after primary settling and an upstream pre-treatment process for carbon and phosphorus removal. The ammonia removal rate was stable and exceeded that of the treatment plant's parallel full-scale high DO nitrifying activated sludge reactor. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed a steady accumulation of Nitrospira to 53% total abundance and a decline in conventional ammonia oxidizing bacteria to <1% total abundance over 400 days of operation. After ruling out other known ammonia oxidizers, qPCR confirmed the accumulation of comammox Nitrospira beginning around day 200, to eventually comprise 94% of all detected amoA and 4% of total bacteria by day 407. Quantitative fluorescence in-situ hybridization confirmed the increasing trend and high relative abundance of Nitrospira. These results demonstrate that comammox can be metabolically relevant to nitrogen transformation in wastewater treatment, and can even dominate the ammonia oxidizing community. Our results suggest that comammox may be an important functional group in energy efficient nitrification systems designed to operate at low DO levels. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study aimed to elucidate the intrinsic mechanisms of PS activation by carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Singlet oxygen generation (O-1(2)) and direct CNTs-mediated electron transfer were hypothesized to be two major pathways of the oxidation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) by PS in the presence of both unmodified and modified CNTs. For the first time, roles of CNT active sites responsible for PS activation were determined using CNT derivatization and structural characterization. By selectively deactivating the carbonyl, hydroxyl or carboxylic groups on CNTs surface and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) analysis, -C=0 groups were determined to be the main active sites contributing to the direct electron transfer oxidation, while singlet oxygen was generated at CNTs defects. Subsequent UV irradiation was shown to cause the recovery of surface defects with I-D/I-G of CNTs increasing by 21%. This resulted in the regeneration of the performance for the coupled system and allowed for multi-cycle activation of PS by CNTs. These results suggest that CNTs/PS system combined with regeneration based on UV irradiation can be used as an effective alternative process for continuous degradation of recalcitrant aqueous contaminants through the non-radical mechanism.

AB Current application of clean water aeration test standards for wastewater treatment systems is reviewed with a focus on problematic interpretations and practices of the most commonly and internationally used standards, edited by the ASCE (USA), CEN (EU/EFTA), and DWA (Germany). Remedy is proposed for these practices, with a view to inspire revision of existing standards toward better understanding and achievement of test accuracy with regard to oxygen transfer rate.
   Themes are (i) the importance of mixing for testing and (ii) the importance of mixing for the relevance of standard oxygen transfer rate for the treatment process, (iii) loop reactor testing and the impact of aeration layout, the circulation time scale and dispersion, (iv) tapered aeration testing, (v) impact of probe response time, (vi) sulfite interference at low temperatures, (vii) the effective depth concept for the dissolved oxygen saturation concentration, and standard corrections to the in situ saturation concentration, (viii) uncertainty estimates on oxygen transfer capacity and efficiency, and (ix) the prospect for simplification and harmonization among existing standards.
   It is suggested that tests based on an improved understanding of the effects of mixing, probe lag, sulfite oxidation kinetics, and fluctuations, will eventually result in the reduction of costly oversizing of aeration systems and improve the understanding of aeration system design and oxygen transfer rate visa-vis energy consumption and substrate conversion in biological wastewater treatment.

AB Taking advantage of the active oxidants generated in the process of Mn(II)-catalyzed sulfite oxidation by oxygen, this study sought to enhance Mn(II) removal from water by activating oxygen with sulfite. The results revealed that Mn(II) can be effectively oxidized by oxygen to MnO2 with the addition of sulfite under environmentally relevant conditions, and the performance of this process is dependent on the dosage of sulfite and the initial pH. Mn K-edge XANES analysis indicates that Mn(II) removal is primarily due to the transformation of Mn(II) to MnO2 and, secondarily, to the adsorption of Mn(II) on generated MnO2. Co-existing NaCl and CaCl2 negatively affect Mn(II) removal, while the presence of Fe(II) considerably enhances Mn(II) removal by improving both Mn(II) oxidation and Mn(II) adsorption on the generated solids. Consequently, Mn(II) removal is as high as 98% in the presence of 1.0 mg/L of Fe(II) and both the residual Mn (<0.1 mg/L Mn) and Fe (<0.3 mg/L Fe) can meet China's drinking water standard. The experiments with real water samples also demonstrate the effectiveness of the sulfite-promoted Mn(II) removal process, especially in the presence of Fe(II). The enhancing effect of sulfite on Mn(II) oxidation by oxygen is mainly associated with the generation of HSO5-, and the critical step for generating HSO5- is the rapid oxidation of SO3 center dot- by oxygen. EPR and radical scavenging studies demonstrate that SO4 center dot- radical is the key reactive oxygen species responsible for Mn(II) oxidation by HSO5-. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The main goal of the current study was to investigate the membrane fouling mechanism of aerobic granular sludge (AGS) with various AGS sizes. In this regard, AGSs were sieved into 6 levels: 0 similar to 0.5, 0.5 similar to 0.7, 0.7 similar to 1, 1 similar to 1.2, 1.2 similar to 1.7 mm and larger than 1.7 mm, then filtrated by a small dead-end filtration cell. Interestingly, there appeared a critical AGS size (1 similar to 1.2 mm) for membrane fouling. Above 1.2 mm, flux increased and fouling reduced with size, due to the loose cake layer and high permeability caused by larger AGS. Below 1 mm, for smaller AGS, higher flux and lower fouling appeared, because less extra cellular polymeric substance (EPS) formed and adhered onto AGS foulants. In the critical size, membrane fouling was serious to the most extent, on account of the dual role of the compact structure of cake fouling layer and the adhesion of EPS. Moreover, this critical AGS size also possessed the highest cake layer, pore blocking and irreversible fouling, which generally existed in various operational conditions. Besides, the results of SEM, AFM, hydrophilicity and ATR-FTIR also proved that the existence of the maximum membrane fouling at the critical AGS size. This study provides a deep understanding of the membrane fouling mechanisms of AGS in membrane filtration and is beneficial for developing a new membrane fouling mitigation strategy by terms of regulating AGS size.

AB Functionalized polymer-clay composites were developed and characterized as engineered geomedia for trace contaminant removal during infiltration of urban runoff. Montmorillonite clays were functionalized with either poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride (PDADMAC) or poly(4-vinylpyridine-co-styrene) (PVPcoS) to enhance organic compound sorption using a simple, scalable synthesis method. Seven representative trace organic compounds and six trace metals were employed to assess the performance of the polymer-clay composites relative to biochar (i.e., an adsorbent proposed for similar purposes) in batch sorption and column studies under simulated stormwater conditions. Contaminant and geomedia electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, and the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) affected sorption. In batch studies, polymer-clay composites exhibited similar performance to biochar for perfluoroalkyl substance removal, but had lower affinity for polar pesticides and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate. Oxyanion removal was greatest for positively-charged PDADMAC-clay composites (particularly Cr [VI]), while PVPcoS-clay composites removed over 95% of Ni, Cd, and Cu. NOM decreased removal of all organic compounds, but increased trace metal removal on clay composites due to sorption of NOM-complexed metals. Polymer-clay composite-amended columns best removed oxyanions, while biocharamended columns exhibited superior removal for all trace organics. At 3 wt% geomedia-sand loading, clay composites exhibited significantly higher saturated hydraulic conductivity than biochar, which is advantageous when clogging is a concern or when rapid infiltration is needed. Under typical urban stormwater conditions, the clay composites will remove contaminants for at least 20-30 years before regeneration or replacement is needed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sulfide induced concrete corrosion significantly reduces the service life of the sewer systems. Gaseous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) levels are a key factor affecting the corrosion rate and these fluctuate due to the diurnal flow pattern of sewers. Currently, there is little known about how such fluctuations, in particular the periodic deprivation of H2S, may affect the corrosion activity. This study investigated the impact of the deprivation of H2S on the sulfide uptake rate (SUR) of concrete coupons incubated in laboratory corrosion chambers. After systematic evaluation of the gaseous H2S concentration profiles of two sewer systems, two types of profiles, i.e. short- (1 h) and long- (12 h) term deprivation of H2S, were applied to the concrete coupons. In comparison to the baseline SUR, exposing the concrete coupon to 0 ppm of H2S for 1 h consistently caused a temporary increase of the SUR (i.e. 3.2%-12.5%) following re-supply of H2S at baseline levels. With the continuous re-supply of H2S, there was gradual and steady decrease of SUR to the level close to the baseline SUR. However, for the case after deprivation of H2S for 12 h, the SUR was 5.1% lower than baseline SUR and gradually increased to a level similar to the baseline SUR during the 20 -30 min of continuous re-supply of H2S. In addition, the simultaneous deprivation of H2S and O-2 for 1 h had negligible impact on the SUR Further analysis suggests that the historically accumulated intermediates of sulfide oxidation could act as electron donors for sulfide oxidizing bacteria (SOB). The replenishment of the intermediates upon the re-supply of H2S could play a key role in the increase of SUR after short-term deprivation of H2S. However, the activity of SOB could be diminished after long-term deprivation of H2S, although the sulfur intermediates still could be available. Estimating the sulfide uptake by concrete using the SUR of the average H2S concentration could lead to overestimation of the sulfide uptake. There could be more significant overestimation for the case with longer deprivation of H2S. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB As one of the key economic modes in China, chemical industry park (CIP) has made great contribution to the Chinese rapid economic growth. Concomitantly, how to effectively and safely dispose of the CIP wastewater (CIPWW) has been an unavoidable issue. Molecular transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in CIPWW treatment is essential to optimize the employed process and to provide solid basis for risk evaluation of the discharged effluent as well. In this study, electrospray ionization coupled with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS) was used to characterize the molecular transformation of DOM during full-scale treatment of integrated chemical wastewater in a centralized wastewater treatment plant (CWWTP), where the combined process follows hydrolysis/acidification (HA)-flocculation/precipitation (FP)-A(2)/O-membrane bioreactor (MBR)-ultrafiltration (UF)-reverse osmosis (RO). Compared to municipal wastewater, DOM in CIPWW exhibited higher unsaturation degree, lower molecular weight, and higher toxicity. In FP unit, DOM of C-<24 and higher nominal oxidation state of carbon (NOSC) values was preferentially removed. The HA and anaerobic units are capable of significantly degrading DOM, resulting in great changes in molecular composition of DOM. However, the anoxic, oxic, and MBR units only lead to a slight change of the molecular formulae. The terminal units of OF and RO can remove most DOM, with the concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) declining by 19.2% and 94.6% respectively. The correlation between spectral indexes and acute toxicity with the molecular formulae of DOM suggested that polyphenols and highly unsaturated phenols were positively correlated with the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)). In addition, both compounds (0.32 < O/C < 0.63) as well as the aliphatic ones (0.22 < O/C < 0.56) presented positive correlation with acute toxicity. Further, the pairwise correlation analysis illustrated that SUVA(254), O/C-wa, double bond equivalence (DBEwa), and NOSCwa were positively correlated with each other, whereas the acute toxicity was positively correlated with humification index (HIX), O/C-wa, and DBEwa.

AB This article reports a study of five designs of vinasse biorefineries that incorporate anaerobic bioreactors followed by a concentration technology such as evaporation, reverse osmosis, or forward osmosis. Different techniques of draw solution regeneration - evaporation, reverse osmosis, and membrane distillation - were also analyzed. Exergy analysis, a method that evaluates the resource conversion efficiency of systems, was used to compare the alternatives. The results indicated that among the alternatives analyzed, the combination of anaerobic digestion and reverse osmosis presented the highest exergy efficiency (62%). However, evaporators were the most feasible in terms of costs. Both alternatives are interesting and the final choice depends on the technology available and local economy. In any case, the treatment of 491.76 m(3)/h of vinasse (exergy rate of 60513.8 kW) to recover 70% of water could reduce external water requirement by 66% and generate 28% additional electricity for the sugarcane plant. In this case, the water recovery could represent an economy of 8,490,435.76 USD/year for the Brazilian alcohol industry. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent advancements in data-driven process control and performance analysis could provide the wastewater treatment industry with an opportunity to reduce costs and improve operations. However, big data in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) is widely underutilized, due in part to a workforce that lacks background knowledge of data science required to fully analyze the unique characteristics of WWTP. Wastewater treatment processes exhibit nonlinear, nonstationary, autocorrelated, and co-correlated behavior that (i) is very difficult to model using first principals and (ii) must be considered when implementing data-driven methods. This review provides an overview of data-driven methods of achieving fault detection, variable prediction, and advanced control of WWTP. We present how big data has been used in the context of WWTP, and much of the discussion can also be applied to water treatment. Due to the assumptions inherent in different data-driven modeling approaches (e.g., control charts, statistical process control, model predictive control, neural networks, transfer functions, fuzzy logic), not all methods are appropriate for every goal or every dataset Practical guidance is given for matching a desired goal with a particular methodology along with considerations regarding the assumed data structure. References for further reading are provided, and an overall analysis framework is presented. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aliphatic amines are common constituents in micropollutants and dissolved organic matter and present in elevated concentrations in wastewater-impacted source waters. Due to high reactivity, reactions of aliphatic amines with ozone are likely to occur during ozonation in water and wastewater treatment. We investigated the kinetics and mechanisms of the reactions of ozone with ethylamine, diethylamine, and triethylamine as model nitrogenous compounds. Species-specific second-order rate constants for the neutral parent amines ranged from 9.3 x 10(4) to 2.2 x 10(6)M(-1)s(-1) and the apparent second-order rate constants at pH 7 for potential or identified transformation products were 6.8 x 10(5) M(-1)s(-1) for N,N-diethylhydroxylamine, similar to 10(5) M(-1)s(-1) for N-ethylhydroxylamine, 1.9 x 10(3) M(-1)s(-1) for N-ethylethanimine oxide, and 3.4M(-1)s(-1) for nitroethane. Product analyses revealed that all amines were transformed to products containing a nitrogen-oxygen bond (e.g., triethylamine N-oxide and nitroethane) with high yields, i.e., 64-100% with regard to the abated target amines. These findings could be confirmed by measurements of singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radical which are formed during the amine-ozone reactions. Based on the high yields of nitroethane from ethylamine and diethylamine, a significant formation of nitroalkanes can be expected during ozonation of waters containing high levels of dissolved organic nitrogen, as expected in wastewaters or wastewater-impaired source waters. This may pose adverse effects on the aquatic environment and human health. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fishy odor has become one of the most often encountered aesthetic water quality problems in drinking water. While fresh water algae living in colder water can produce offensive fishy odors, their environmental behaviors remain poorly understood. In this study, two chrysophyte species (Synura uvella and Ochromonas sp.), which are often associated with fishy odor events, were selected to investigate the effect of temperature (8,16, and 24 degrees C) and light intensity (10, 41, and 185 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) on algal growth and odorant production. Five polyunsaturated aldehyde derivatives, including 2,4-heptadienal, 2-octenal, 2,4-octadienal, 2,4-decadienal, and 2,4,7-dectridienal, were identified as fishy/cod liver oil/fatty/rancid descriptors in the cultures of the two algae based on gas chromatography-olfactometry-mass spectrometry and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry. While biomass yield increased with the increase in temperature for both species, significantly higher odorant yields (production of odorants per cell) were obtained at 8 degrees C. The total odorant production and cell yield of the odorants decreased with the increase in light intensity from 10 to 185 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). The biodegradation half-lives for the released odorants were 6-10 hat 8 degrees C and 2-4 hat 24 degrees C, whereas the volatilization half-lives were 36-97 d at 8 degrees C and 6-17 d at 24 degrees C, suggesting that temperature dependent biodegradation was an important factor controlling the fate of fishy compounds in aquatic environments. The results of this study will help clarify why most fishy odor events occur in cooler seasons, and provide knowledge related to cold water persistence for the management of fishy odor problems associated with algae.

AB Much about assembly processes dictating bio-cake microbiota remains uncertain, leading to poor understanding of membrane biofouling in membrane bioreactors (MBRs). This work aimed to reveal the underlying mechanisms driving bio-cake community during the biofouling process under different flux conditions. On the basis of 16S rRNA sequences, the results showed that bacterial diversity decreased with increasing fouling. Additionally, low-flux bio-cake (8 LMH) communities harbored much lower diversity than high-flux (16 LMH) bio-cake microbiomes. Ecological null model analyses and phylogenetic molecular ecological networks (pMENs) revealed that environmental filtering deterministically governed low-flux bio-cake communities. In contrast, high-flux bio-cake communities were mainly shaped in a stochastic manner. This is likely due to the higher stochastic deposition of bacterial taxa from bulk sludge because of the presence of a stronger drag force. Moreover, by lowering the flux, the interactions between bacterial lineages were enhanced; this is evidenced by the greater number of links, the higher average degree, and the higher average clustering coefficients within the pMENs in low-flux bio-cakes than those in high-flux bio-cakes. Most keystone fouling-related taxa in low-flux bio-cakes were motile and involved in nitrate reduction and polysaccharide/protein metabolism. This corroborated the important role of environmental filtering in the assembly process dictating low-flux bio-cake formation. Some low-abundance taxa were observed to be key fouling-related bacteria under both flux conditions, indicating that a few populations play paramount ecological roles in triggering biofouling. In summary, our findings clearly indicate distinct bio-cake community assembly patterns under different operational conditions and highlight the importance of developing specialized strategies for fouling control in individual MBR systems.

TI Effects of UV disinfection on phenotypes and genotypes of

AB To elucidate the effects of UV disinfection on antibiotic resistance in biologically-treated wastewater, we investigated the antibiotic resistance profiles, species of cultivable heterotrophic bacteria, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in antibiotic-resistant bacteria before and after treatment. UV disinfection greatly changed the bacterial community structure and the antibiotic resistance in wastewater. The antibiotic resistance in wastewater samples was strongly associated with the bacterial community. The proportions of Gram-positive bacteria gradually increased with increasing UV fluence. The proportions of bacteria resistant to cephalexin, penicillin, and vancomycin all greatly decreased after UV treatment in both sampling events (July 2018 and January 2019), and those for bacteria resistant to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and sulfadiazine increased, resulting from the alternative antibiotic resistance profiles among different genera. UV disinfection induced the selection of multi-antibiotic resistant (MAR) bacteria. For example, the MAR indices of Aeromonas, the dominant genus during the treatments, were significantly increased after UV irradiation (P < 0.05). The MAR index was also markedly increased (P < 0.05) at a fluence of 5 mJ/cm(2) in both events. In UV10 treatment, the bacterial community structure was greatly changed. The genera with relatively low MAR indices replaced that with high MAR indices, and became the dominant genera. As a result, the MAR indices of treated samples showed a decreased trend after 10 mJ/cm(2) UV irradiation. The detection frequencies of ARGs located on the chromosome varied mainly due to the evolution of the microbial community. The occurrence of ARGs (tetA, tetC, tetM, tetW, tetX, and RIM) located on plasmid DNA decreased after UV disinfection, and the average detection frequencies of tet and sul genes decreased by 15% and 6%, respectively (P < 0.05). Generally speaking, the effect of UV disinfection on the enrichment of antibiotic resistance is limited in this study, and horizontal gene transfer via the plasmids in surviving bacteria might be impaired due to the decreased abundance of ARGs on the plasmids.

AB The hybrid membrane bioreactor - nanofiltration treatment process can be an effective approach for treating the landfill leachate, but the residual leachate concentrate highly loaded with the humic substance and salts remains an environmental concern. Herein, a loose nanofiltration membrane (molecular weight cut-off of 860 Da) was used to recover the humic substance, which can act as a key component of organic fertilizer, from the leachate concentrate. The loose nanofiltration membrane showed the high permeation fluxes and high transmissions (>94.7%) for most inorganic ions (i.e., Na+, K+, Cl-, and NO3-, while retaining 95.7 +/- 0.3% of the humic substance, demonstrating its great potential in effective fractionation of humic substance from inorganic salts in the leachate concentrate. The operation conditions, i.e., cross-flow rates and temperatures, had more pronounced impacts on the filtration performance of the loose nanofiltration membrane. Increasing cross-flow rates from 60 to 260 L h(-1) resulted in an improvement of ca. 7.3% in the humic substance rejection, mainly due to the reduced concentration polarization effect. In contrast, the solute rejection of the nanofiltration membrane was negatively dependent on the temperature. The rejection of humic substance decreased from 96.3 +/- 0.3% to 92.0 +/- 0.4% with increasing the temperature from 23 to 35 degrees C, likely due to the enlargement of the membrane pore size and enhancement in solute diffusivity. The humic substance was enriched from 1735 to 15,287 mg L-1, yielding a 91.2% recovery ratio with 85.7% desalination efficiency at a concentration factor of 9.6. The recovered HS had significantly stimulated the seed germination and growth of the green mungbean plants with no obvious phytotoxicity. These results demonstrate that loose nano filtration can be an effective promising technology to recover the humic substance as a valuable fertilizer component towards sustainable management of the landfill leachate concentrate.

AB Poor hand hygiene contributes to diarrhea in developing countries. Handwashing with soap reduces diarrhea risk, but drying hands on contaminated towels can compromise the benefits of handwashing. In response to the challenge of keeping hands clean, an antimicrobial hand towel was developed and shown to be promising in the laboratory, but has not been adequately tested in the field. We evaluated the effectiveness of an antimicrobial towel in two randomized, double-blinded crossover trials among mothers with children<5 years old in 125 households in western Kenya. In trial 1, we randomly assigned mothers to use either the treated towel or an identical untreated (placebo) towel and made surprise home visits at random times once a week for three weeks. At each visit, we tested hands for Escherichia coli using sterile hand rinses, then switched towel types in the two groups and repeated three weekly rounds of E. coli testing. In crossover trial 2, we compared E. coli contamination of maternal hands immediately following three different handwashing/drying procedures: soap and water + treated towel, water only + treated towel, and soap and water + air dry. There was no statistically significant difference in the level of E. coli contamination on maternal hands by type of towel used during trial 1 (odds ratio for treated vs untreated towel: 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.83-1.56). In trial 2, there were no significant differences in E. coli contamination of maternal hands by handwashing/drying procedure. In these trials, use of antimicrobial hand towels did not prevent E. coli contamination of mothers' hands in Kenyan households during random testing and offered no advantages over standard handwashing and drying practices. Handwashing with soap and clean water and drying with clean towels are recommended. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Perchlorate has been widely detected in various water environments and could cause serious health problems. Methane has been proposed as a promising electron donor to remove perchlorate from contaminated water, yet it is unclear whether and how microbial methane oxidation couples with perchlorate reduction, in particular under anoxic conditions. Here, the feasibility and performance of perchlorate reduction driven by methane in the presence and absence of oxygen were investigated and compared in a lab-scale methane-based membrane biofilm reactor. Long-term operational performance suggested that perchlorate was reduced to chloride, with 4 mg Cl/L/d of perchlorate removal rate under anoxic conditions. Differently, perchlorate removal rate increased to 16 mg Cl/L/d, and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were produced from methane partial oxidation when a limited oxygen (10 mg/L/d) was externally supplied. Regardless of oxygen conditions, microbial perchlorate reduction driven by methane might be mediated through synergistic interactions by a microbial consortium, but with different key microbial members under both oxygen regimes. Under anoxic conditions, aerobic methanotrophs (likely Methyl-ocystaceae and Methylococcaceae) might micro-aerobically oxidize methane by utilizing internal oxygen from microbial perchlorate reduction, which might be mediated by Rhodocyclaceae. In contrast, under oxygen-limiting conditions, methanogens (e.g., Methanosarcina) and fermenters (e.g., Veillonellaceae) likely jointly converted methane into VFAs, then dissimilatory perchlorate-reducing bacteria (e.g., Rhodocyclaceae) utilized the produced VFAs to reduce perchlorate to chloride. Our findings provide evidence to link methane oxidation with perchlorate reduction under both oxygen regimes, which could be facilitated to design a process to remove perchlorate from groundwater.

AB Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is an important opportunistic pathogen that thrives best in the distal elements of plumbing and waste-water systems. Although nosocomial outbreaks of PA have been associated with water sources, the role of the plumbing system of healthcare premises as a reservoir for this pathogen is still unclear.
   Materials and methods: We collected water samples from 12 technical areas, distant from any medical activity, in a teaching hospital in France once a week for 11 weeks. We used a method that resuscitates persister cells because of the nutrient-poor conditions and the presence of inhibitors (e.g. chlorine and copper ions). Briefly, water was sampled in sterile bottles containing 100 mu M of the copper-ion chelating agent diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC). A portion of the samples was immediately filtered through 0.45-mu m membranes, deposited on R2A agar plates, and incubated seven days at 22 degrees C (following European recommendations). The remaining water was incubated 14 days at 22 degrees C and then filtered and cultured on R2A, blood-, or cetrimide-containing agar plates. PA isolates were identified by MS MALDI-TOF, genotyped by PFGE and WGS, and tested for survival in a 150 mu g/L copper (II) sulphate solution.
   Results: Although the 12 water sampling points always tested negative with the recommended method, 67% were positive at least once for PA with the adapted method (i.e. with DDTC). The 14 PA persister isolates found throughout the plumbing system were clonal and belong to the high-risk clone ST308. Their genome harbours a 37-kb genomic island (GI-7) containing 13 genes linked to copper resistance. ST308 survived better in the copper solution than comparators that did not harbour GI-7 (P. aeruginosa strains PAO1, PA14, and ST235). The deletion of GI-7 in ST308 abrogated its tolerance to copper. The GI-7 nucleotide sequence shares 98% and 72% identity with sequences from the environmental species Pseudomonas putida and the phytopathogenic species Pseudomonas syringae, respectively.
   Conclusion: We report the contamination of the plumbing system of a healthcare premises by persister cells of the high-risk clone P. aeruginosa ST308. New recommendations for the monitoring of water contamination should consider persister cells. The genomic island GI-7, which confers tolerance to copper, probably originates from Pseudomonas species found in copper-contaminated soils and plants. Agricultural practices may have an unexpected consequence, allowing copper-tolerant pathogens to survive in the hospital environment and contaminate fragile patients. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Construction of the great Upper Gotvand Dam in the Karun River, Iran, with an impoundment capacity of 4.5 billion cubic meters, has resulted in an environmental disaster: accumulation of 66.5 million metric tonnes of dissolved salt in the reservoir and a dramatic increase in the salinity of the reservoir water up to 200 g/L. This paper aims to identify and assess the main sources of the salinization of the reservoir water integrating multiple data: (1) geological and geomorphological evidence; (2) continuous vertical records of electrical conductivity at 11 stations along the reservoir; (3) total dissolved solids and major ion concentrations of 108 water samples at 58 sampling stations; (4) delta O-18, delta H-2 in 35 water samples and delta Cl-37 in 16 water samples from the reservoir and surrounding rivers and springs. Geological and geomorphological evidence, hydrogeochemical data and isotopic signature reveal that halite dissolution is the main cause of salinization in the Gotvand Reservoir. The results show that salt dissolution in the Gachsaran Formation (especially at Anbar Ridge), which was under-estimated in the study phase of the project, has provided about 86 per cent of the dissolved salt accumulated in the reservoir over a 2-year period since the impoundment of the reservoir in 2011.

AB Mercury (Hg) speciation can affect its removal efficiency by adsorbents. This study assessed the removal of dissolved inorganic Hg(II) species (Hg(II)*), beta-HgS nanoparticles (HgS NP), and Hg complexed with dissolved organic matter (Hg-DOM) by three sorbents: activated carbon (AC), sulfur-impregnated activated carbon (SAC), and organoclay (OC). The effect of ionic composition, solution ionic strength, and natural organic matter (NOM) concentration on the removal of each Hg species was also evaluated. The three adsorbents were all effective in removing Hg(II)*, Hg-DOM, and HgS NPs. Increasing ionic strength decreased the removal of Hg(II)* species due to the formation of ionic Hg species with lower affinity for the sorbents. Added NOM decreased the removal of Hg(II)* and HgS NPs by all sorbents with the OC sorbent being most susceptible to NOM fouling. On a surface area-normalized basis, the OC removed all types of Hg species better than the AC and SAC samples. Moreover, adsorbed Hg-DOM transformed to a beta-HgS phase on the OC, but not for AC and SAC. These studies indicate that both Hg speciation and the water quality parameters need to be considered when designing sorbent-based emission controls to meet Hg removal targets.

AB The efficient and safe degradation of drugs present in wastewater requires the design of a new material possessing high activity for that process. In addition to other methods, photoelectrocatalysis (PEC) merges the strengths of both photocatalytic and electrochemical methods, and the efficiency could be enhanced by the type of photoelectrode material. To address this challenge, three Ti/TiO2 nanotube-based photoelectrodes, differing in their tube morphology, were prepared by anodic oxidation and employed for the degradation of the 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) drug by the PEC process. The highest efficiency for 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) degradation by PEC was observed for the photoelectrode with a 1.7 mu m length, 65 nm diameter and 8 nm wall thickness of TiO2 nanotubes, which were prepared by Ti foil anodization at 30 V. The effects of applied potential, irradiation intensity, initial pH and 5-FU concentration on PEC were investigated. Furthermore, our findings showed that the mechanism of photoelectrocatalysis in the presence of TiO2 nanotubes is based on center dot OH and h(+) activity. To determine the 5-FU degradation pathway, the organic byproducts were identified by LC-MS analysis. Furthermore, the ecotoxicity evaluated during PEC dropped with decreasing 5-FU concentration.

AB A novel iron-cycling process based on core-shell iron granules, which contained zero-valent iron (Fe) in the core and maghemite (gamma-Fe2O3) on the shell (Fe-0@Fe-III granules), was proposed to in-situ control hydrogen sulfide in the sediments of the polluted urban rivers. The Fe-0@Fe-III granules added in the top sediment layer removed 97% of sulfide generated by sulfate-reducing bacteria in the sediments, and the sulfide removal capacity of virgin granules was 163 mg S/g Fe (114 mg S/g granule). The Fe-0@FeIII granules removed the formed sulfide through the abiotic sulfide oxidation and precipitation, and they also stimulated the microbial iron reduction, which competitively consumed wastewater-derived organics and partially inhibited the sulfate reduction in the sediments. The used Fe-0@Fe-III granules were easily regenerated through magnetic separation from sediments and air exposure for 12 h, which enhanced the sulfide removal capacities of the regenerated granules by 12%-22%, compared to the virgin granules. During the air exposure, ferrous products (i.e., iron sulfide and surface-associated Fe-II) on the granule shell were completely oxidized to poorly ordered Fe-III hydroxides (gamma-FeOOH and amorphous FeOOH) having larger specific surface areas and higher reactivity to sulfide than gamma-Fe2O3 on the virgin granules. Meanwhile, the Fe-0 in the core was also partially oxidized through the indirect electron transfer, which was facilitated by the electrically conductive iron oxide minerals (Fe3O4 and Fe2O3) and the microbial electron carriers (e.g., Geobacter). The oxidation of Fe core contributed additional Fe-III hydroxides to the sulfide control. The Fe-0@Fe-III granules were reused for four times in a 293-day trial, and their overall sulfide removal capacity was at least 920 mg S/g Fe. The proposed iron-cycling process can be a chemical saving, energy-saving and cost-effective approach for the hydrogen sulfide control in the sediments of polluted urban rivers, as well as lakes, aquaculture ponds and marine.

AB Natural source zone depletion (NSZD) of light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs) includes partitioning, transport and degradation of LNAPL components. NSZD is being considered as a site closure option during later stages of active remediation of LNAPL contaminated sites, and where LNAPL mass removal is limiting. To ensure NSZD meets compliance criteria and to design enhanced NSZD actions if required, residual risks posed by LNAPL and its long term behaviour require estimation. Prediction of long-term NSZD trends requires linking physicochemical partitioning and transport processes with bioprocesses at multiple scales within a modelling framework. Here we expand and build on the knowledge base of a recent review of NSZD, to establish the key processes and understanding required to model NSZD long term. We describe key challenges to our understanding, inclusive of the dominance of methanogenic or aerobic biodegradation processes, the potentially changeability of rates due to the weathering profile of LNAPL product types and ages, and linkages to underlying bioprocesses. We critically discuss different scales in subsurface simulation and modelling of NSZD. Focusing on processes at Darcy scale, 36 models addressing processes of importance to NSZD are investigated. We investigate the capabilities of models to accommodate more than 20 subsurface transport and transformation phenomena and present comparisons in several tables. We discuss the applicability of each group of models for specific site conditions. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharge is often considered a principal source of surface water contamination. In this study, a three-dimensional fully-integrated groundwater surface water model was used to simulate the transport characteristics and cumulative loading of an artificial sweetener (acesulfame) and fecal indicator bacteria (Escherichia colt) from WWTPs within a 6800 km(2) mixed-use, highly impacted watershed in Ontario, Canada. The model, which employed 3.5 x 10(6) computational nodes and 15 layers, facilitated a comprehensive assessment of groundwater surface water interactions under high and low flow conditions; processes typically not accounted for in WWTP cumulative effects models. Simulations demonstrate that the model had significant capacity in reproducing the average and transient multi-year groundwater and surface water flow conditions in the watershed. As a proxy human-specific conservative tracer, acesulfame was useful for model validation and to help inform the representation of watershed-scale transport processes. Using a uniform WWTP acesulfame loading rate of 7.14 mg person(-1) day(-1), the general spatial trends and magnitudes of the acesulfame concentration profile along the main river reach within the watershed were reproduced; however, model performance was improved by tuning individual WWTP loading rates. Although instream dilution and groundwater surface water interactions were strongly dependent on flow conditions, the main reach primarily consisted of groundwater discharge zones. For this reason, hydrodynamic dispersion in the hyporheic zone is shown as the predominant mechanism driving acesulfame into near-stream shallow groundwater, while under high flow conditions, the simulations demonstrate the potential for advective flushing of the shallow groundwater. Regarding the cumulative impact of the WWTPs on E. coli concentrations in the surface flow system, simulated transient E. coli levels downstream of WWTPs in the watershed were significantly lower than observed values, thus highlighting the potential importance of other sources of E. coli in the watershed.

AB In this study, a numerical framework which jointly uses discrete element method, kinetic Monte Carlo method and lattice Boltzmann method is proposed to predict the electrochemical performance of solid oxide fuel cell cathode from raw powder. A total of 770 La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) cathodes with different microstructures are numerically synthesized using various particle size, size distribution, pore former content and sintering time. Best performance is found at a porosity of approximately 0.40. The cathode performance degrades tremendously at about a critical porosity of 0.10-0.25 because the pores become disconnected. The critical porosity is found to have a positive linear dependency on the mean pore size. Cathodes that have smaller mean pore size may still operate functionally at a low porosity of 0.10. A response surface model (RSM) is proposed to predict the overpotential from microstructural parameters. The RSM is also found to be valid for real cathode microstructures and can be served as an off-line assessment tool for the cathode performance.

AB Designing energy conversion systems with high efficiencies and low pollutant emission is essential for sustainable development. A new cogeneration system including a high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell, integrated with a solar methanol steam reformer, and a Kalina cycle is proposed to produce electricity and heat. Using energy, exergy and cost balance, the proposed system is analyzed from the viewpoints of exergy, economy, and environmental impact. A Parametric study is performed and shows that a higher fuel cell temperature is in favor of the total product unit cost and carbon dioxide mass specific emission. Also, the exergy efficiency is maximized, and the total product unit cost as well as the carbon dioxide mass specific emission are minimized at some specific values of anode recirculation ratio. Optimization results show that the average daily exergy efficiency can increase by up to 29.3% and the total product unit cost as well as the carbon dioxide mass specific emission can decrease by up to 17.72% and 16.3%, respectively compared to the corresponding values under the base conditions. It is concluded that combining a Kalina cycle with a high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell along with utilizing solar energy for reforming process yields an efficient energy conversion system with low emission.

AB In order to improve the thermal efficiency of coke-oven gas power generation, this work establishes electrochemical and thermodynamic models for a novel process of coke-oven gas fueled solid oxide fuel cell integrated with its anode off-gas recirculation and chemical looping combustion. It begins with a traditional process with all anode off-gas combusted with air in an after burner for heat recovery, which suffers from higher steam consumption, lower power generation, and higher CO2 emissions. Key operating parameters of the steam/COG ratio of steam methane reforming, fuel utilization factor and recycle ratio of solid oxide fuel cell, as well as oxygen carrier and air inputs of chemical looping combustion are thoroughly analyzed and optimized for power generation of the proposed process. The net electricity generation for the novel and traditional processes are 315.8 and 290.7 MW per 500.3 MW of coke-oven gas consumption, respectively. Moreover, the exergy efficiency is improved from 56.4% to 63.1% and about zero direct CO2 emissions is achieved in the novel process.

AB The calcium looping process is one of the most prospective candidates for thermochemical energy storage system owing to its high energy density, widespread availability and low cost. This paper aims to explore the effect of sensible heat on storage efficiency in the system of thermochemical energy storage based on calcium looping process. Three storage efficiencies in the charging process, discharging process, and total system are defined to quantify the role of sensible heat. The obtained results indicate that the maximum storage efficiencies in the charging process, discharging process, and total system are limited by the amount of sensible heat. Their values can be increased by 45.1%, 32.1%, and 61.59% when the sensible heat is taken full advantage in the charging process, discharging process, and total system, as compared to those without sensible heat. In addition, a sensitivity analysis on the amount of sensible heat is also performed, which demonstrates the amount of sensible heat is determined by different operation conditions. A positive effect is observed on the amount of sensible heat from several dominant parameters including reactor size, reaction temperature, molar flow of calcium carbonate and split ratio, except for carbonation pressure and carbon dioxide storage pressure. Besides, the optimal amount of sensible heat is in the range of 15-40% carbon dioxide percentage of the gas phase under the discharging pressure from 3 to 7 bar. These valuable results can deepen our understanding of the importance of heat recovery in the systems of thermochemical energy storage. More importantly, some meaningful descriptors are established to efficiently assess storage efficiencies for all gas-solid systems of thermochemical energy storage with heat recovery.

AB Thermal management is indispensable to the lithium-ion battery packs utilized in electrical vehicles. In this study, a novel air-cooling-based battery thermal management system with the heat fins-assisted phase change material/expanded graphite structure is proposed. After verification of the accuracy of the thermal model based on experimental measurements, numerical studies are performed on a battery submodule. All the results are obtained at an ambient temperature of 25 degrees C. Considering the complexity of the multi-physics modeling, a Kriging-based high-dimensional model representation method is employed to perform the global sensitivity analysis with relatively low computational effort. The results reveal the influence of the design variables on the thermal performance of the proposed cooling system. Moreover, this method reveals the correlations between the design variables, which reduce the dimensions of the given problem and improve the computational efficiency during optimization. Finally, a series of simulation-based tests is performed to validate the superiority of the optimal cooling system under realistic and extreme operation conditions. The comparison results show that this system can effectively improve the thermal behavior of the battery, and this cooling system after optimization provides much better cooling efficiency in alleviating the temperature increase and reducing the temperature difference of the batteries within the battery packs compared to the original one.

AB The stringent regulations, increased global temperature and customer demand for high fuel economy have led to rapid developments of different alternative propulsion solutions in the last decade, with special attention to the electrified vehicles. The combination of electric machines with conventional powertrains allows to diversify the powertrain architectures. In addition, alternative combustion modes as reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) have been shown to provide simultaneous ultra-low NOx and soot emissions with similar or better thermal efficiency than conventional diesel combustion (CDC). Therefore, the combination of both technologies creates a promising horizon to be implemented in commercial vehicles of the near future. In this work, experimental and numerical simulations were combined to study the potential of the parallel full hybrid electric vehicle (P2-FHEV) and mild hybrid vehicle (MHEV) to obtain lower fuel consumption and NOx emissions than a conventional powertrain in the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Cycle (WLTC). The hybrid vehicles are simulated with both CDC and diesel-gasoline RCCI combustion engines as power source. Each powertrain was optimized in terms of components (battery, electric motors...) capacity, internal combustion engine operative points, energy management strategy and gear ratios. The results show a significant fuel consumption reduction as the complexity of the hybrid system increases. The parallel architecture, which represents the most complex hybrid system tested in this work, allows obtaining a fuel consumption reduction of around 20% as compared to CDC. The dual-mode CDC-RCCI concept showed improvements in NOx and soot emissions with comparable values in terms of energy consumption and CO2 emissions than CDC. Additionally, the mild hybrid technology with the functionality of start-stop, torque assist and regenerative braking showed an acceptable balance between complexity and fuel consumption gain.

AB Combined cooling, heating and power systems realize an energy cascade utilization that has high overall energy efficiency and economic benefits. A typical combined cooling, heating and power system model was built, and an optimization method based on an exhaustive search method and a cost-oriented index was proposed to determine the optimal system configuration. Further, based on a residential building in Weifang city, an economic comparison of combined cooling, heating and power system was analyzed, by following electric load and following thermal load strategies. As a result, there is an economic difference of approximately 1 yuan per unit of energy supply area, with 58 yuan for following thermal load strategy and 57 yuan for following electric load strategy. Its originality lies on the introduction of an estimation method that could quickly and easily determine the optimal rated capacity of devices for combined cooling, heating and power system. Moreover, the effect of building features on the cost of combined cooling, heating and power system was analyzed in terms of the distance between the system and buildings, as well as the building floor area ratio. It indicates that combined cooling, heating and power system displays a better economy for a larger area, and following electric load strategy is more benefit for the system. Finally, the feasibility of solar thermal utilization in combined cooling, heating and power system was analyzed. The results show that the solar collectors only provide economic advantage for a smaller energy supply area, without coupling with combined cooling, heating and power system. To some extent, it is contrary to the current view of promoting solar utilization.

AB This paper presents the experimental advances on the implementation of structural polymeric materials in a micro-turbine-generator for an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and through testing provides an insight of its performance. The aim is to create awareness of the huge techno-economical potential that polymers represent as metal replacement in ORC applications. A micro-turbine-generator is developed considering R245fa as the working fluid. The unit is built using polymeric components; these components include an impeller made from polyether-ether-ketone and a nozzle body made from polyethylene. A program for the simulation of the micro turbine performance is developed, a series of tests are conducted with compressed air and the performance with R245fa is predicted. The impeller was experimentally demonstrated to be able to withstand a rotational speed of 32,040 rpm whereas the predicted results showed the aerodynamic efficiency and the aerodynamic power to be around 0.65 and 1200 W respectively. The future of polymeric materials in ORC looks promising though a long-term test using the refrigerant as the working fluid is still needed to verify material-fluid compatibility, lifespan and resistance to fatigue.

AB In this paper, we present a pairwise-relaxing meshless (PRM) method for solving the Euler equations of compressible flows within the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) framework. Derived from the moving particle semi-implicit (MPS) method and the finite volume particle (FVP) method, the PRM approximates the derivatives from the value defined at the midpoint of each interacting particle pairs through a kernel-based formulation. Pairwise-relaxing constants are introduced to the kernels to provide degree of freedom to enforce the Taylor-series consistency condition while mass, momentum and energy are conserved exactly. An upwind high-order reconstruction scheme via a corrective procedure and variable cut-off radius is also developed for this PRM method. The HLLC approximate Riemann solver is adopted to solve Riemann problem. One and two-dimensional numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the performance of the PRM method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB An integral equation-based numerical method for scattering from multi-dielectric cylinders is presented. Electromagnetic fields are represented via layer potentials in terms of surface densities with physical interpretations. The existence of null-field representations then adds superior flexibility to the modeling. Local representations are used for fast field evaluation at points away from their sources. Partially global representations, constructed as to reduce the strength of kernel singularities, are used for near-evaluations. A mix of local- and partially global representations is also used to derive the system of integral equations from which the physical densities are solved. Unique solvability is proven for the special case of scattering from a homogeneous cylinder under rather general conditions. High achievable accuracy is demonstrated for several examples found in the literature. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Conservation of energy, spurious-free, and optimal convergence are among the most favorite ingredients of a discontinuous Galerkin finite-element time-domain method (DG-FETD) for the analysis of transient electromagnetic problems. Unfortunately, due to the reliance on dissipative upwind flux to suppress spurious modes, most existing DG-FETDs possess only one or two of them. In this paper, we present a novel two-dimensional DG-FETD method, which combines all of the three advantages. The proposed method is based on the electric field E and magnetic field H, whose approximation spaces are composed of Whitney's edge functions. To inhibit the spurious modes while keeping the conservation of numerical energy, the numerical flux with dissipation is not adopted. Instead, a carefully designed interface condition along with the non-dissipative central flux is employed for this purpose. That is, across each face of an element except for those coinciding with boundaries of the computational domain, if E is strongly enforced to be tangential continuous then the continuity of His weakly imposed, and vice versa. For the convenience of complying with this requirement and without loss of the inherent parallelism of the DG-FETD method, two partially staggered sets of subdomains are built for E and H, respectively. These subdomains are made up of sub-elements generated through a refinement of each cell on the initial mesh into four similar elements. The final discrete system is advanced with a second order leap-frog time-stepping scheme. A series of numerical examples demonstrate that the present method is robust and much more superior to the conventional DG-FETD methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This is the second part to our companion paper [18]. Herein, we generalize to two space dimensions the C-method developed in [20,18] for adding localized, space-time smooth artificial viscosity to nonlinear systems of conservation laws that propagate shock waves, rarefaction waves, and contact discontinuities. For gas dynamics, the C-method couples the Euler equations to scalar reaction-diffusion equations, which we call C-equations, whose solutions serve as space-time smooth artificial viscosity indicators for shocks and contacts. We develop a high-order numerical algorithm for gas dynamics in 2-D which can accurately simulate the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability with Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) roll-up of the contact discontinuity, as well as shock collision and bounce-back. Solutions to our C-equations not only indicate the location of the shocks and contacts, but also track the geometry of the evolving fronts. This allows us to implement both directionally isotropic and anisotropic artificial viscosity schemes, the latter adding diffusion only in directions tangential to the evolving front. We additionally produce a novel shock collision indicator function, which naturally activates during shock collision, and then smoothly deactivates. Moreover, we implement a high-frequency 2-D wavelet-based noise detector together with an efficient and localized noise removal algorithm.
   To test the methodology, we use a highly simplified WENO-based discretization scheme. We provide numerical results for some classical 2-D test problems, including the RT problem, the Noh problem, a circular explosion problem from the Liska & Wendroff [13] review paper, the Sedov blast wave problem, the double Mach 10 reflection test, and a shock-wall collision problem. In particular, we show that our artificial viscosity method can eliminate the wall-heating phenomenon for the Noh problem, and thereby produce an accurate, non-oscillatory solution, even though our simplified WENO-type scheme fails to run for this problem.

AB In this first part of two papers, we extend the C-method developed in [40] for adding localized, space-time smooth artificial viscosity to nonlinear systems of conservation laws that propagate shock waves, rarefaction waves, and contact discontinuities in one space dimension. For gas dynamics, the C-method couples the Euler equations to a scalar reaction-diffusion equation, whose solution C serves as a space-time smooth artificial viscosity indicator.
   The purpose of this paper is the development of a high-order numerical algorithm for shock-wall collision and bounce-back. Specifically, we generalize the original C-method by adding a new collision indicator, which naturally activates during shock-wall collision. Additionally, we implement a new high-frequency wavelet-based noise detector together with an efficient and localized noise removal algorithm. To test the methodology, we use a highly simplified WENO-based discretization scheme. We show that our scheme improves the order of accuracy of our WENO algorithm, handles extremely strong discontinuities (ranging up to nine orders of magnitude), allows for shock collision and bounce back, and removes high frequency noise. The causes of the well-known "wall heating" phenomenon are discussed, and we demonstrate that this particular pathology can be effectively treated in the framework of the C-method. This method is generalized to two space dimensions in the second part of this work [41]. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We propose an adaptive multiscale method to improve the efficiency and the accuracy of numerical computations by combining numerical homogenization and domain decomposition for modeling flow and transport. Our approach focuses on minimizing the use of fine scale properties associated with advection and diffusion/dispersion. Here a fine scale flow and transport problem is solved in subdomains defined by a transient region where spatial changes in transported species concentrations are large while a coarse scale problem is solved in the remaining subdomains. Away from the transient region, effective macroscopic properties are obtained using local numerical homogenization. An Enhanced Velocity Mixed Finite Element Method (EVMFEM) as a domain decomposition scheme is used to couple these coarse and fine subdomains [1]. Specifically, homogenization is employed here only when coarse and fine scale problems can be decoupled to extract temporal invariants in the form of effective parameters. In this paper, a number of numerical tests are presented for demonstrating the capabilities of this adaptive numerical homogenization approach in upscaling flow and transport in heterogeneous porous medium.

AB We present a six-moment multi-fluid model, which solves the governing equations for both ions and electrons, with pressure anisotropy along and perpendicular to the magnetic field direction, as well as the complete set of Maxwell equations. This set of equations includes the Hall effect, different temperatures for different species and pressure anisotropy. It is more comprehensive than the five-moment equations with isotropic pressures and significantly less expensive than the ten-moment equations with a full pressure tensors. Similarly to the five-and ten-moment equations, the wave speeds are naturally limited by the speed of light, which eliminates the issue of unlimited whistler wave speeds present in Hall magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). It is also possible to simulate multiple negatively charged fluids, which cannot be done in MHD models. The six-moment model is a reasonable description of the plasma outside magnetic reconnection regions and therefore well-suited to be coupled with an embedded particle-in-cell model that covers the reconnection region. Our numerical implementation uses a point-implicit scheme for the stiff source terms, and we use a second-order accurate Rusanov-type scheme with carefully selected wave speeds. For the plasma variables and the magnetic field the maximum wave speed is based on the fast magnetosonic speed of MHD with anisotropic pressures that we derive. For the electric field related variables the speed of light is used. The divergence of the magnetic field and Gauss's law are controlled with a hyperbolic-parabolic scheme. We present a number of numerical tests to demonstrate that this numerical model is robust without being excessively diffusive. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID MONTE-CARLO METHOD; MECHANICS
AB Recently, two approaches were suggested which combine signed particles and neural networks to speed up the time-dependent simulation of quantum systems. Both specialize on the efficient computation of a multi-dimensional function defined over the phase space known as the Wigner kernel. While the first approach completely defines the network analytically, the second is based on an architecture with generalization capabilities. Although relatively simple, these networks can reduce the amount of memory needed and provide a computational speedup, but they are both affected by the use of expensive activation functions (sinusoidals). In this work, we go beyond these previous strategies and suggest a more general network consisting of a set of different hidden layers which are based on less expensive activation functions (e.g. rectified linear units), and which now predict one column of the discretized kernel at a time. This approach comes with generalization capabilities and allows the network to accurately learn a transform from the space of potentials to the space of kernels. As it is shown in our final validation test, this new approach performs very well during the simulation of quantum systems. In fact, while keeping a good accuracy, it further reduces the amount of memory required along with its computational burden. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we present a method to control the discretization error in constrained aerodynamic shape optimization problems using meshes adapted via adjoint-based error estimates. The optimization constraints may involve outputs that are not directly targeted for optimization, and hence also not for error estimation and mesh adaptation. However, discretization errors in these outputs often indirectly affect the calculation of the objective function. The proposed method takes this effect into account, so that the mesh is adapted and itself optimized to predict both objective outputs and constraint outputs with appropriate accuracy. We use unstructured mesh optimization to maximize accuracy of the results for a given number of degrees of freedom. The error estimates drive a multifidelity optimization process, preventing over-optimization on a coarse mesh and over-refinement on an undesired design. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method on several airfoil shape optimization problems governed by the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The framework is expected to be even more important for optimization problems with complex systems, dramatic design changes, or high-accuracy requirements. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Uncertainty quantification of engineering systems modeled by computationally intensive numerical models remains a challenging task, despite the increase in computer power. Efficient uncertainty propagation of such models can be performed by use of surrogate models, such as polynomial chaos expansions (PCE). A major drawback of standard PCE is that its predictive ability decreases with increase of the problem dimension for a fixed computational budget. This is related to the fact that the number of terms in the expansion increases fast with the input variable dimension. To address this issue, Tipireddy and Ghanem (2014) introduced a sparse PCE representation based on a transformation of the coordinate system in Gaussian input variable spaces. In this contribution, we propose to identify the projection operator underlying this transformation and approximate the coefficients of the resulting PCE through partial least squares (PLS) analysis. The proposed PCE-driven PLS algorithm identifies the directions with the largest predictive significance in the PCE representation based on a set of samples from the input random variables and corresponding response variable. This approach does not require gradient evaluations, which makes it efficient for high dimensional problems with black-box numerical models. We assess the proposed approach with three numerical examples in high-dimensional input spaces, comparing its performance with low-rank tensor approximations. These examples demonstrate that the PLS-based PCE method provides accurate representations even for strongly non-linear problems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The generalized Debye source representation of time-harmonic electromagnetic fields yields well-conditioned second-kind integral equations for a variety of boundary value problems, including the problems of scattering from perfect electric conductors and dielectric bodies. Furthermore, these representations, and resulting integral equations, are fully stable in the static limit as omega -> 0 in multiply connected geometries. In this paper, we present the first high-order accurate solver based on this representation for bodies of revolution. The resulting solver uses a Nystrom discretization of a one-dimensional generating curve and high-order integral equation methods for applying and inverting surface differentials. The accuracy and speed of the solvers are demonstrated in several numerical examples. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Block copolymers provide a wonderful platform in the study of soft condensed matter systems. Many fascinating ordered structures have been discovered in bulk and confined systems. Among various theories, the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) has been proven to be a powerful tool for studying the equilibrium ordered structures. Many numerical methods have been developed to solve the SCFT model. However, most of these focus on the bulk systems, and little work on the confined systems, especially on general curved surfaces. In this work, we developed a linear surface finite element method, which has a rigorous mathematical theory to guarantee numerical precision, to study the self-assembled phases of block copolymers on general curved surfaces based on the SCFT. Furthermore, to capture the consistent surface for a given self-assembled pattern, an adaptive approach to optimize the size of the general curved surface has been proposed. To demonstrate the power of this approach, we investigate the self-assembled patterns of diblock copolymers on several distinct curved surfaces, including five closed surfaces and an unclosed surface. Numerical results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method. The obtained ordered structures are consistent with the previous results on standard surfaces, such as sphere and torus. More significantly, the proposed numerical framework can be applied to study the phase behaviors of block copolymers on general surfaces accurately. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we present a new limiter for discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes, based on subcell resolution through reconstructed flux correction, for hyperbolic conservation laws. This limitation technique is constructed by means of a subcell Finite Volume (FV) formulation. The algorithm is thus simple, and is able to retain the very high accurate subcell resolution of DG schemes.
   The main idea of this correction procedure is to preserve as much as possible the high accuracy and the very precise subcell resolution of DG schemes. Consequently, an a posteriori correction will only be applied locally at the subcell scale where it is needed, but still ensuring the scheme conservation. To do so, we first reformulate DG schemes as a subcell FV scheme provided the use of the correct numerical flux. This very simple development provides us with the so-called DG reconstructed flux. This theoretical part will serve as a basis for our limiter framework.
   Practically, at each time step, we compute a DG candidate solution and check if this solution is admissible (for instance positive, non-oscillating, ...). If it is the case, we go further in time. Otherwise, we return to the previous time step and correct locally, at the subcell scale, the numerical solution. This is why it is refereed to as a posteriori limitation. To this end, each cell is subdivided into subcells. Then, if the solution is locally detected as bad, we substitute the DG reconstructed flux on the subcell boundaries by a robust first-order or second-order TVD numerical flux. And for subcell detected as admissible, we keep the high-order reconstructed flux which allows us to retain the very high accurate resolution and conservation of the DG scheme. Furthermore, only the solution inside troubled subcells and its first neighbors will have to be recomputed, elsewhere the solution remains unchanged. Numerical results on various type problems and test cases will be presented, both in 1D and 2D on Cartesian grids, to assess the very good performance of the design limiting algorithm.

AB We consider reduced order modelling of unsteady convection-dominated convection-diffusion-reaction problems with proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) in combination with isogeometric analysis. Isogeometric analysis has potential advantages in exact geometry representations, efficient mesh generation, different (h, p, and k) refinements and smooth Bspline/NURBS basis functions. In order to compensate the oscillations caused by the convection-dominated effect, the streamline-upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) stabilization method is used both in generation of snapshots and POD-Galerkin method. Based on the recent novel and promising discretization method-Isogeometric analysis, we propose a new fully discrete SUPG-stabilized scheme, the associated numerical error features three components due to spatial discretization by isogeometric analysis with SUPG stabilization, time discretization with the Crank-Nicolson scheme, and modes truncation by POD. We show a priori error estimates of the fully discrete scheme and give suitable stabilization parameters numerically. A variety of two and three-dimensional benchmark tests and numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness, accuracy, and efficiency of the reduced order modelling methods by virtue of potential advantages of isogeometric analysis.

AB Compressed sensing algorithms approximate functions using limited evaluations by searching for a sparse representation among a dictionary of basis functions. Orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) is a greedy algorithm for selecting basis functions whose computational cost scales with the size of the dictionary. For polynomial chaos (PC) approximations, the size of the dictionary grows quickly with the number of model inputs and the maximum polynomial degree, making them often prohibitive to use with greedy methods. We propose two new algorithms for efficiently constructing sparse PC expansions for problems with high-dimensional inputs. The first algorithm is a parallel OMP method coupled with an incremental QR factorization scheme, wherein the model construction step is interleaved with a nu-fold cross-validation procedure. The second approach is a randomized greedy algorithm that leverages a probabilistic argument to only evaluate a subset of basis functions from the dictionary at each iteration of the incremental algorithm. The randomized algorithm is demonstrated to recover model outputs with a similar level of sparsity and accuracy as OMP, but with a cost that is independent of the dictionary size. Both algorithms are validated with a numerical comparison of their performance on a series of algebraic test problems and PDEs with high-dimensional inputs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB An extended volume of fluid method is developed for two-phase direct numerical simulations of systems with one viscoelastic and one Newtonian phase. A complete set of governing equations is derived by conditional volume averaging the local instantaneous bulk equations and interface jump conditions. The homogeneous mixture model is applied for the closure of the volume-averaged equations. An additional interfacial stress term arises in this volume-averaged formulation which requires special treatment in the finite-volume discretization on a general unstructured mesh. A novel numerical scheme is proposed for the second-order accurate finite-volume discretization of the interface stress term. We demonstrate that this scheme allows for a consistent treatment of the interface stress and the surface tension force in the pressure equation of the segregated solution approach. Because of the high Weissenberg number problem, an appropriate stabilization approach is applied to the constitutive equation of the viscoelastic phase to increase the robustness of the method at higher fluid elasticity. Direct numerical simulations of the transient motion of a bubble rising in a quiescent viscoelastic fluid are performed for the purpose of experimental code validation. The well-known jump discontinuity in the terminal bubble rise velocity when the bubble volume exceeds a critical value is captured by the method. The formulation of the interfacial stress together with the novel scheme for its discretization is found crucial for the quantitatively correct prediction of the jump discontinuity in the terminal bubble rise velocity.

AB This paper presents a new iterative state estimation algorithm for advection dominated flows with non-Gaussian uncertainty description of L-infinity-type: uncertain initial condition and model error are assumed to be pointwise bounded in space and time, and the observation noise has uncertain but bounded second moments. The algorithm approximates this L-infinity-type bounding set by a union of possibly overlapping ellipsoids, which are localised (in space) on a number of sub-domains. On each sub-domain the state of the original system is estimated by the standard L-2-type filter (e.g. Kalman minimax filter) which uses Gaussian/ellipsoidal uncertainty description and observations (if any) which correspond to this sub-domain. The resulting local state estimates are stitched together by the iterative d-ADN Schwarz method to reconstruct the state of the original system. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated with a set of numerical examples. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we develop algorithms to overcome the curse of dimensionality in non-convex state-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (HJ PDEs) arising from optimal control and differential game problems. The subproblems are independent and they can be implemented in an embarrassingly parallel fashion. This is ideal for perfect scaling in parallel computing. The algorithm is proposed to overcome the curse of dimensionality [1,2] when solving HJ PDE. The major contribution of the paper is to change either the solving of a PDE problem or an optimization problem over a space of curves to an optimization problem of a single vector, which goes beyond the work of [40]. We extend the method in [7,9,15], and conjecturea (Lax-type) minimization principle to solve state-dependent HJ PDE when the Hamiltonian is convex, as well as a (Hopf-type) maximization principle to solve state-dependent HJ PDE when the Hamiltonian is non-convex, as a generalization of the well-known Hopf formula in [18,25,50]. We showed the validity of the formula under restricted assumption for the sake of completeness, and would like to bring our readers to [62] which validates our conjectures in a more general setting. We conjectured the weakest assumption of our formula to hold is a pseudoconvexity assumption similar to one stated in [50]. Our method is expected to have application in control theory, differential game problems and elsewhere. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

   The scheme is based on a temporal operator splitting, with the homogeneous system solved using a finite volume method based on a WENO reconstruction, and the temporal ODEs solved using an analytical approximate solution. The method is found to perform favorably against problems with known exact solutions, and numerical solutions published in the open literature. It is simple to implement, and to the best of the authors' knowledge it is currently the only method for solving this modified version of the GPR model. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation (together with Maxwell's equations) provides the basis for plasma flow calculations. While the terms accounting for long range forces are established, different drift and diffusion terms are used to describe Coulomb collisions. Here, linear drift and a constant diffusion coefficient are considered and the electromagnetic fields are imposed, i.e., plasma frequency is not addressed. The solution algorithm is based on evolving computational particles of a large ensemble according to a Langevin equation, whereas the time step size is typically limited by plasma frequency, Coulomb collision frequency and cyclotron frequency. To overcome the latter two time step size constraints, a novel time integration scheme for the particle evolution is presented. It only requires that gradients of mean velocity, bath temperature, magnetic field and electric field have to be resolved along the trajectories. In fact, if these gradients are zero, then the new integration scheme is statistically exact; no matter how large the time step is chosen. Obviously, this is a computational advantage compared to classical integration schemes, which is demonstrated with numerical experiments of isolated charged particle trajectories under the influence of constant magnetic- and electric fields. Besides single ion trajectories, also plasma flow in spatially varying electromagnetic fields was investigated, that is, the influence of time step size and grid resolution on the final solution was studied.

AB Motivated by the recent paper (Wang and Wu, 2018 [12]), where the authors proposed a class of functionally-fitted energy-preserving integrators for Poisson systems, in this paper we aim at developing exponential integrators with quadratic energy preservation for the important class of linear Poisson systems. By rewriting the linear Poisson system in a new formulation, we apply the symplectic exponential Runge-Kutta methods and thus obtain a novel class of exponential integrators for the linear Poisson system. It is proved that the obtained exponential integrator can exactly preserve the quadratic energy. In comparison with the functionally-fitted energy-preserving methods whose numerical performance depends on the fitted frequency, the new exponential integrators are independent of the fitted frequency and convenient to use. Furthermore, we investigate the convergence of the fixed-point iteration used in the implementation of the proposed exponential integrator, and show that the convergence region of the stepsize is independent of the norm of the skew-symmetric matrix. Finally, numerical results with the Euler equations of a free rigid body soundly support the remarkable performance of the exponential integrator in both the global errors and the energy preservation.

AB In this paper, an accurate and efficient numerical scheme is developed to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for two-phase flow systems with the nonlinear inertial term in conservation form. The major difficulty of discretizing the nonlinear inertial term in conservation form in two-phase flows is rooted in the discontinuous nature of momentum across interfaces. To overcome this difficulty, we developed the mixed Upwind/Central WENO scheme so that no grid deformation or mapping, or explicit interface reconstruction is necessary. Our mixed Upwind/Central WENO scheme also removes the dependence on the interface tracking/capturing method so it is compatible with any popular interface tracking/capturing methods. To decouple the overall equations of the two-phase system, an efficient semi-implicit projection scheme is constructed, which shares the efficiency of pressure stabilization method while enforces divergence-free condition to machine precision, to benefit interface advection, reduction consistency as well as large density ratio. The accuracy and reduction consistency of this projection scheme are validated by numerical experiments. Several benchmark cases are performed to show the capability of the overall scheme handling realistic two-phase problems with multiple physical effects, complex interface evolution and/or large density ratio of the order of (rho(water)/rho(air)). Both quantitative and qualitative comparisons have been made and very good agreements with analytical solutions, published numerical and/or experimental results are achieved. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB The aim of this paper is to compare a hyperelastic with a hypoelastic model describing the Eulerian dynamics of solids in the context of non-linear elastoplastic deformations. Specifically, we consider the well-known hypoelastic Wilkins model, which is compared against a hyperelastic model based on the work of Godunov and Romenski. First, we discuss some general conceptual differences of the two approaches. Second, a detailed study of both models is proposed, where differences are made evident at the aid of deriving a hypoelastic-type model corresponding to the hyperelastic model and a particular equation of state used in this paper. Third, using the same high order ADER Finite Volume and Discontinuous Galerkin methods on fixed and moving unstructured meshes for both models, a wide range of numerical benchmark test problems has been solved. The numerical solutions obtained for the two different models are directly compared with each other. For small elastic deformations, the two models produce very similar solutions that are close to each other. However, if large elastic or elastoplastic deformations occur, the solutions present larger differences. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   decomposition; Hellinger distance; Auto-ignition
ID DIRECT NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS; TENSOR DECOMPOSITIONS
AB We propose an anomaly detection method for multi-variate scientific data based on analysis of high-order joint moments. Using kurtosis as a reliable measure of outliers, we suggest that principal kurtosis vectors, by analogy to principal component analysis (PCA) vectors, signify the principal directions along which outliers appear. The inception of an anomaly, then, manifests as a change in the principal values and vectors of kurtosis. Obtaining the principal kurtosis vectors requires decomposing a fourth order joint cumulant tensor for which we use a simple, computationally less expensive approach that involves performing a singular value decomposition (SVD) over the matricized tensor. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on synthetic data, and develop an algorithm to identify the occurrence of a spatial and/or temporal anomalous event in scientific phenomena. The algorithm decomposes the data into several spatial sub-domains and time steps to identify regions with such events. Feature moment metrics, based on the alignments of the principal kurtosis vectors, are computed at each sub-domain and time step for all features to quantify their relative importance towards the overall kurtosis in the data. Accordingly, spatial and temporal anomaly metrics for each sub-domain are proposed using the Hellinger distance of the feature moment metric distribution from a suitable nominal distribution. We apply the algorithm to two turbulent auto-ignition combustion cases and demonstrate that the anomaly metrics reliably capture the occurrence of autoignition in relevant spatial sub-domains at the right time steps.

AB Compatible Galerkin methods (the Galerkin analogue of an Arakawa C-Grid) are growing in popularity for simulating geophysical fluid flows, due to their desirable characteristics, including but not limited to: energy conservation, higher-order accuracy, steady geostrophic modes and the absence of spurious stationary modes, such as pressure modes. However, these characteristics still do not guarantee good wave dispersion properties. In this work, we study the dispersion properties of two compatible Galerkin families for the 2D linear rotating shallow water equations on quadrilaterals: the Q(n)(-)Lambda(k) family from finite element exterior calculus and the newly developed MGD(n) family. These families are the extensions to quadrilaterals of the P-n(C) - P-n-1(DG) and GD(n) - DGD(n-1) pairs, respectively, studied for the 1D linear shallow water equations in [13]. A major finding from that paper was that the PCn - P-n-1(DG) pair has spectral gaps for n >= 2 and the GD(n) - DGD(n-1) does not. These spectral gaps are non-dimensional wavenumbers where the dispersion relationship is double-valued, and lead to anomalous dispersion and noise in numerical simulations. On quadrilaterals, previous work [24,26] on the Q(n)(-)Lambda(k) family for inertia waves with n = 2 and for gravity waves for arbitrary n has indicated the presence of spectral gaps, in the form of line discontinuities. The investigation of these gaps for the Q(n)(-)Lambda(k) family is extended in this paper to inertia-gravity waves for arbitrary n, including plots of the dispersion relationship for n = 2 when using the lumping developed in [26,35] that eliminates the spectral gaps. Additionally, the MGD(n) family is studied (including the use of reduced quadrature), which is found to be free of spectral gaps. For both families asymptotic convergence rates are established, effective resolutions determined and plots of the dispersion relationships for a range of nand Rossby radii are shown. Finally, a pair of numerical simulations are run to investigate the consequences of the spectral gaps and highlight the main differences between the two families. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB The efficient reduction of statistical error and achieving numerically convergent solutions in Eulerian-Lagrangian (EL) simulations necessitate the use of Parcel-Number-Density Control (PNDC) algorithms. Many PNDC algorithms have been proposed in other fields, like plasma simulations, which have not been evaluated for particle-laden two-phase flows. In this research, for the assessment of different deterministic and stochastic PNDCs, a new test case is devised in which the statistical error can be filtered out to measure the level of inconsistency imposed by a PNDC. The results show that the closeness of the movement direction is the best criterion for the parcel selection in the merging process, compared to similar position or weight criterion. Here, a new blended deterministic PNDC, which has the least error among deterministic PNDCs, is proposed by combining the pair merging and ternary merging schemes. In addition, modified variants of stochastic PNDCs based on the two-value PDF concept are proposed which satisfy all consistency requirements. These stochastic PNDCs are proved to be much more promising for more challenging situations, like poly-dispersed flows or particles with larger Stokes numbers. The computational overhead of these algorithms are compared and the best algorithm is recommended. Finally, it is proved that a convergent EL solution with a controlled statistical error can be obtained using these PNDCs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Starting from classical absorbing boundary conditions (ABC), we propose a method for the separation of time-dependent wave fields given measurements of the total wave field. The method is local in space and time, deterministic, and makes no prior assumptions on the frequency spectrum and the location of sources or physical boundaries. By using increasingly higher order ABC, the method can be made arbitrarily accurate and is, in that sense, exact. Numerical examples illustrate the usefulness for source separation and echo removal.

The ZnO sample shows well crystallized hexagonal phase. About 90% of reactive red (RR141) azo dye degraded after UV light irradiation for only 40 min. The photodegradation reaction follows the pseudo first-order kinetics with a high rate constant (k) of 0.0677 min(-1). The catalyst retains its photodegradation efficiency of 99% even after three times of use.

The morphology, chemical and electrochemical properties of the as-prepared materials were comprehensively investigated. Notably, the PDA coating endows the PAN/PMMA surface enhanced hydrophilic properties and thus increased the electrolyte uptake and ionic conductivity, resulting in better electrochemical behaviors. The battery using the PDA-PAN/PMMA nanofibrous separator exhibits more stable cycling performance and higher reversible capability than those of the battery with PAN/PMMA membrane separator and commercial PP separator.

AB The mechanical reliability of 45S5 bioactive glass-derived scaffolds was quantified, for the first time, by determining the Weibull modulus (m) in compressive loading mode. The scaffolds were fabricated by sponge replication followed by sinter-crystallization (main crystalline phase Na2CaSi2O6) and exhibited a trabecular pore-strut 3D architecture. The Weibull modulus (m = 6) was higher than most of those reported in the literature for bioactive glass and ceramic scaffolds. The compressive strength was found dependent on porosity according to a power-law relationship. The mechanical properties and bone-like macroporous structure of these glass-ceramic scaffolds show great promise for use in bone repair applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this contribution, alkaline carbonates were used as catalyst to develop an one-pot approach for esterification between cellulose and methacrylate anhydrides in aqueous solution. FTIR, C-13 CP/MAS NMR and XRD analysis revealed successful esterification in amorphous domains of cellulose without affecting the cellulose crystal structure. The obtained methacrylated cellulose was amenable to further functionalization via thiol-ene click reactions. After this esterification under alkaline aqueous condition, cellulose can be easily grafted with thiolated motifs including fluorophores and bioactive peptide. Our work demonstrates an easy strategy for cellulose modification and functionalization and will greatly promote the wide-spread applications of cellulose-based materials. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The a and c lattice parameters of the oxalic acid dihydrate increase under the effect of increasing external pressures within the ranges from -1.17 GPa to -0.12 GPa and from -1.17 GPa to -0.51 GPa, respectively. The largest magnitude of the compressibility along a direction is found at P = -0.83 GPa (k(a) = -166.21 TPa-1). The magnitude of the negative compressibility along the a crystallographic direction in the oxalic acid dihydrate is one the largest found up to date. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This research reports the thermoelectric properties of the Al-doped ZnO (AZO)/silicon-rich oxide (SRO) superlattices. The thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) as functions of the grain size, thickness of the superlattices, the number of SRO layers, and conductance were studied. The use of the SRO layers markedly improved the thermoelectric ZT. Moreover, the replacement of ZnO by AZO further increased the ZT. The ZT value of the AZO/SRO superlattices was as high as 0.44 when the total thickness was 45 nm and three SRO interlayers were inserted. The improvement of ZT was contributed by the reduction of the grain size, formation of the Si nanocrystals and the increase in the electrical conductance caused by using SRO interlayers and Al doping.

AB The effect of the matrix growth texture on the longitudinal modulus of a titanium matrix composite was investigated. The matrix coating by magnetron sputtering was composed of hexagonal alpha and exhibited fibrous texture that the < 0 0 0 1 > direction was parallel to the SiC fiber direction. The growth texture was 6 times random. After consolidation, this texture of hexagonal alpha was retained and enhanced. The texture in the composite was 11 times random. The cubic beta in the composite showed weak texture that the < 1 1 0 > direction was parallel to the fiber direction. The longitudinal modulus of the composite was improved by the fibrous texture of hexagonal alpha. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Martensite (alpha') usually plays an important role in the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) of metastable austenitic stainless steels (gamma-SS). However, there is still controversy about the location of hydrogen accumulation after martensitic transformation in gamma-SS. Scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM) combined with finite element analysis (FEA) have been used to study the hydrogen distribution and evolution in hydrogen-precharged gamma-SS after martensitic transformation. It is found that hydrogen accumulates in austenite (gamma) adjacent to alpha' after the formation of alpha' The peak of hydrogen concentration in gamma induced by alpha' increases first and then decreases as hydrogen diffuses further into gamma .

AB Cu(OH)(2) nanowire arrays supported on nanoporous copper were synthesized via anodic oxidation at different voltages. Nanoporous copper was prepared through dealloying Zr50Cu50 amorphous ribbon to obtain a uniform aperture. This unique composite structure combines the excellent conductivity of nanoporous copper with the high catalytic activity of Cu(OH)(2) nanowires and can be directly used as a support electrode to explore the electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose. The sensor showed a wide linear response range from 10.0 mu M to 10.0 mM and high sensitivity of 1.866 mA cm(-2) M-1. As such, it provides a basis for the future production of enzyme-free glucose sensors. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigate the effect of heat treatment on the microstructure and fatigue strength of Co-Cr-Mo alloys fabricated by selective laser melting. Specimens are prepared in vertical and horizontal orientations with respect to the build direction and are subjected to heat treatment at 1150 degrees C for 1 h. Evaluation of the microstructure and fatigue strength reveals that the heat-treated specimens have significantly higher fatigue strength than the as-built specimens, which is attributed to the occurrence of recrystallization and the disappearance of molten pool boundaries during heat treatment. However, despite microstructure homogenization in the heat-treated samples, they exhibit mechanical anisotropy (similar to the as-built samples), which is attributed to the influence of the sample orientation on the number of layers and the processing time.

The crystal structure, morphology and optical property of as-prepared samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission electron microscope (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. WO3(H2O)(0.333)/BiOI heterojunction showed excellent photocatalytic performance under visible light. The constant k(app) of WO3(H2O)(0.333)/BiOI is 0.08599 min(-1), which is 3.33 and 51.49 times greater than that of BiOI and WO3(H2O)(0.333), respectively. Moreover, WO3(H2O)(0.333)/BiOI heterostructure also presented high photostability. Finally, the direct Z-scheme photocatalytic mechanism of WO3(H2O)(0.333)/BiOI was proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Metal oxide ceramics find widespread use as catalytic/photo-catalytic materials for a vast range of chemical reactions. For water-based reactions, hydroxylization, a process connected to the wettability of the surface, can greatly influence catalytic activity of a metal oxide. We present an investigation of the wetting properties of CuFeO2 delafossite oxide synthesized using hydrothermal methods. The material displayed significant variance in wetting properties, from highly hydrophobic for the as-grown powder, to complete wetting for porous cold-pressed pellets. A series of annealing treatments was performed to remove adsorbed functional groups. After annealing treatment at relatively low temperatures T > 300 degrees C (T-melt similar to 1100 degrees C), the CuFeO2 surface displayed superhydrophilicity and a rapid absorption of H2O droplets via its intergranular porosity.

AB A relatively simple and inexpensive method to enhance the optical absorption of P3HT:PCBM films is hereby presented. By evaporating different concentrations of polystyrene in the mixtures, nanocavities were obtained. An increase in the optical light path due to the internal reflection between the cavities and the P3HT:PCBM media, enhances the optical absorption. Theoretical density photocurrents were calculated for these films, and considerable increases were obtained compared to films without cavities. The methodology proposed may have promising applications in active materials for organic solar cells. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The synergestic role of boric acid, as a crystal modifier, and screw dislocation step defects on the crystal growth and formation mechanism of nickel micro-nanocones during electrocrystallization is explained using density functional theory (DFT) and Monte Carlo (MC) calculations. Earlier atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies provided direct evidences on the effect of boric acid on morphology distribution of nickel micro-nanocones and confirmed the presence of terraces and steps due to the spiral growth of screw dislocation. In the presence of boric acid, the formation of nickel-borate complex leads to a decrease in the system's supersaturation and in turn provides an appropriate condition for screw dislocation driven-growth. DFT and MC simulations reveal that the nickel-borate complex primarily adsorb in the step edges with the lowest adsorption energy barrier, after which the crystal growth is inhibited on these edges resulting in the formation of nanocone structures.

AB The structure of ethane-bridged PMOs was tailored for the first time through a post-synthesis method upon the addition of different sodium salts. It is proposed that the counterions can affect the surfactant micelles inside the PMOs, and further hydrothermal treatment will lead to a structure rearrangement of PMOs around the micelles. However, the results show that the effect of counterions on the structure of PMOs in the post-synthesis method is less pronounced compared with that of the effect in the direct-synthesis method, and additional surfactant is essential for maintaining the structure ordering of the materials.
